B00006RU5B|4.0|In ways this supergroup reminds me of when Sammy Hagar joined Van Halen.  A great group suddenly takes on a more melodic and tuneful style simply because they've gained a new singer who isn't so limited in range or talent.  Not to discredit Zach De La Rocha or David Lee Roth, but no one was ever going to accuse them of being great singers.  Chris Cornell's addition definitely makes this a band with songs you can actually sing along to, as opposed to grunt along with as De La Rocha encouraged.  And of course, the end result sounds more like Soundgarden than Rage, but it's also a much more mainstream Soundgarden.  Whereas Cornell's old band tended to contrast their bombast with occasional flourishes of Beatlesque soundscapes, Audioslave tends to play it close to the tried and true, heavy on the riffage, light on the pretentions.  The result is an unremarkable but ultimately very satisfying record, the same way a Big Mac is satisfying - it ain't the best thing you've ever had, but you've had it enough times to know you like it and can depend on it and want to have it again.
B000077VOY|5.0|I love all the GERRY ANDERSON 'SUPERMARIONATION' series BUT this is my favorite!  Why?  Distinct and complete character development!  While THUNDERBIRDS and CAPTAIN SCARLET focus more on the ships and gadgets....STINGRAY focuses more on TROY TEMPEST, ATLANTA,  MARINA, PHONES, COMANDER SHORE, TITAN, X2-0, etc.  I have the BRITISH version of the set and it does have many more extras that I wish they would release in the states...Guest appearances on BRITISH TV Shows, Bumper cards, Memorabillia, Commercials...not sure why they just can't add this stuff on the A&E releases???  This is a GREAT series and the prints look EXCELLENT!  Rick Goldschmidt RANKIN/BASS Historian
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I saw a preview of this restored version at a screening in Santa Fe, when the titles were still in German and the last reel was still being worked on. This really is a labor of love. Placeholders describe the scenes that are probably forever lost (nearly a quarter of the original). Everything is finally in the correct sequence, and the film's never looked better. I'm looking forward to the DVD so I can re-experience this taste of what is almost a lost film.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|There is, of course, only so much you can do with a submarine movie -- depth charges, leaky pipes, bolts popping, Taking Her Down Deeper Than She Was Ever Meant To Go, etc.  But this movie does them all very well.  You'll be on the edge of your seat even though you realize that you're being manipulated and that the plot twists are preposterous.  Probably the cleverest part of the movie is the plot device of focusing on the genuinely likeable young lieutenant who isn't quite ready to be a captain and is forced by circumstances to show that he has what it takes.  And the special effects are outstanding -- the plot itself is more than a little over-the-top, particularly toward the end, but the effects are entirely believable.  The acting is likewise uniformly excellent.  I still put this a notch or two below Das Boot.  Das Boot is a truly great submarine movie (more than that -- a truly great movie, period), while U-571 is a truly excellent &quot;Hollywood&quot; submarine movie (less believable, more bombastic, more attuned to American tastes).  Watch them both on the same day and you'll be a nervous wreck.
0066214122|4.0|Having lost his job at a high tech firm, forty year-old Jack Foreman has become a househusband while his wife is now the breadwinner, working on a top secret Defense Department project.  Jack raises their three children, while wondering how everything could collapse so fast.  He even believes that his wife is having an affair while working an experimental design nanotechnology project at the Xymos Corporation in the Nevada desert.<br />Suddenly, their baby becomes extremely ill, but just as abruptly the infant recovers.  Jack is stunned by both related events that have no explanation.  However, before he can ponder what occurred, Xymos hires Jack as a consultant on his spouse's project that has problems leading to the Pentagon ready to shut the funding.  Something goes wrong leaving Jack and a few others trapped in a war of survival against a highly evolved deadly nanotechnical swarm that he believes his wife released.<br />Perhaps the leading modern day cautionary tale author, Michael Crichton provides readers with his latest alarm that focuses on nanotechnical research.  The story line is standard Crichton lamenting runaway science conducting experiments in areas in which consequences are ignored as funding only is considered.  As usual, work occurs inside an isolated facility that leads to individuals heroically struggling to survive humanity's latest blunder.  Fans of the author or just solid science fiction readers centering on a modern day controversy will appreciate Mr. Crichton who is at his masterly, but formulaic (at least its his own DNA) best.<br />Harriet Klausner
B00006IRHA|3.0|This movie is a good film if you've either never read the Harry Potter books or have only read them once.  But for someone like me whose read the first book at least 10 times, it's a bit of a disappointment.  There are so many scenes that are left completly unexplained in the movie that would not have taken any longer to explain.  The transitions from one part to the next are very crisp and dry.  I was hoping that this 2 disc dvd would include all the scenes that were cut from the movie due to it's length.  However, once you find the deleted scenes, there's not much special about them.  There's parts that are explained without the questions being asked.  The characters do play the parts well, and the essence is there, but the film just doesn't flow.  Spend your money on tickets to The Chamber of Secrets instead.

B00005R2BG|5.0|I cut my review down shorter . In short , the movie takes music and turns them fun . You do not have to be sensitive to watch this movie . The movie was lots of fun and has angles that keeps the movie very intense . If you think you have to be sensitive , you prolly are one of those cliche analytical people who have to put a label on everything . Lighten up and give the movie a chance .
B00005JLRR|2.0|I think the director was terrible in doing this, and was very disappointed, Johnathon Frakes should have done it, he knows how star trek should be...
B000002GBJ|5.0|ive had it.  i am really sick of people complaining about music not aging too well..some people use the word &quot;cheesy&quot;.  my reply?  develop YOUR OWN taste in music and quit following current trends.  i also am sick of when people claim a prog-artist's music is overblown and pompous.  are we to prohibit an artist from expanding upon their compositional and technical skills?  think about it... if an artist such as wakeman created verse-chorus songs with 4 chords you'd hear just as many people cry sell-out.
0066214122|3.0|I am a big fan of Crichton's past work, and ever since Andromeda Strain I have always looked forward to his new releases.  This book is similar to his past few in that it deals with the dark side of technology.  I found it not as scary as \\"Jurassic Park,\\" nor as interesting as \\"Timeline.\\"  This book is entertaining; however, with a slightly stronger plotline, it would have been an outstanding sci-fi thriller.<br />Using a first-person narrative, the book is actually a nice introduction to the science of complexity theory, complex adaptive systems, emergence, networks, and of course, nanotechnology.  These topics have been on the forefront of scientific research during the past decade, and for those unfamiliar with these topics, this book serves a good (if not eye-opening) way to learn.  The idea of runaway nanomachines is not new, and along with genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, is frequently brought up by those who warn of the dangers of technology.  As pointed out in the book, humans as a species have a unique ability to screw things up, and Murphy's Law often occurs in unexpected ways.  The sobering fact is, since the advent of nuclear weapons, we now have the ability to destroy the planet.  Out-of-control, genetically-engineered viruses or intelligent nanomachines simply add to this threat.<br />Could the scenario presented in \\"Prey\\" actually occur?  Yes, although in the reality it could turn out to be much, much worse. In retrospect, I admit that this is my whole beef with the plot; with just a little more effort, the story could have involved a more terrifying, widespread threat, more sinister global villians, and/or a wider range of protagonists.  Perhaps a less fortunate ending would have added to the perceived danger as well, leaving the reader with more food for thought.  It will be interesting to see how Hollywood deals with this script (assuming it makes it to the big screen).  It could turn out to be more like \\"Sphere\\" and less like the original \\"Jurassic Park.\\"<br />Unless you are collector of Crichton's first editions, you might want to borrow this book from a friend or local library, pick up a used copy, or simply wait for the paperback to be published.  It is certainly not the worst Crichton book I have ever read, nor is it, in my opinion, his finest.
B000068OCS|5.0|Directed by Godfrey Reggio, produced by Francis Ford Coppola, shot by Ron Fricke and scored by Philip Glass, the first of the \\"...qatsi\\" trilogy is a hard work to top. The music, sublime for the most part, minimalistic in its entirety, perfectly frames visuals of incredible natural beauty, mostly shot in the US Southwest followed by contrasting images from NTC, depicting the pollution and desolation brought about by human-\\"kind.\\" The central theme and the music are aimed at conveying several Hopi prophecies:<br />-If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster.<br />-Near the day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth in the sky.<br />-A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans.<br />All in all a call to action, a call to reflection in these troubled times: as current today as it was upon being released, almost twenty years ago.

It was a hard book to put down because it was both easy to read, and the reader, like the father, was looking for satisfaction in finding Susie Salmon's killer- who never came to justice, just being the victim of Susie's last-minute revenge.<br />    Congradulations on a book well written!

B00005R23S|5.0|Bruce & the E Street Band continue to lay claim to the mantle of the greatest rock and roll band and show (sorry Mick). A brilliantly calculated mixture of old and new, energizing rock, soft ballads, Bruce contols a mastery of his audience's emotions like no other performer. \\"Live from New York City\\" does an excellent job of featuring the entire band, who together make the whole much greater than the sum of the parts. <br />My only criticism is I want more. Three hours goes too quickly. Give me a full version of 'Back in Your Arms' and I will shut up. Anyone who could possbile rate this less than a 5 is simply out of their mind.
B00006WL2B|5.0|This re-issue of a 1977 recording by the soloists chorus and the<br />Berlin Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan. It is on a Hybrid<br />SACD that means it will play in your CD player and most DVD players too. This is a big boned full bodied perfomance recorded for a special occasion. No where<br />do you get the feeling of it being just another recording of the Ninth. Karajan and company give it their all on this one. The Direct Stream Digital (or DSD) remaster helps the listener hear<br />the inner parts of the recording and the music as never before and the CD layer sounds great too. And since the price is only a little more than a typical CD it is a great buy. It is interesting that Universal Classics ( DG, Decca and Phillips) have decided to go with the SACD instead of going with DVD-Audio as originally announced. It will be interesting to see what Karajan recordings they issue on SACD next. I understandt that the Mozart Requiem will be one of them. I think Karajan would approve.
B000000OSG|5.0|G 'n R, otherwise known as \\"Roses\\" back in the day, put out some top-quality stuff here, a real humdinger of a heavy-metal album. What's more, they began a revolution of rock music in the 90s that has unfortunately faded today.<BR> <BR>Recommendation: if you can't hang with the big doggz, then please get out of the kitchen.<br />\\"Get 'n the Ring\\" is one of the greatest songz ever recorded, an unabashed rant against journalists, corporations, and the overall greed that pervades this world.  I'm glad Axl \\"the tough one\\" Rose finally took a stand against what ails our society.  His \\"rap\\" portion within the song is not to be missed.<br />Other stellar moments on this record include the nostalgic \\"14 Years,\\" as well as the heartbreaking \\"Estranged\\".  (Listen to it and see if you don't shed a tear or two).<br />\\"Illusion II\\" might not contain that one undeniable Roses hit, one like \\"November Rain\\" or \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\", but it is chock-full of some major heavy rockers, from back when rock and roll music really mattered.<br />Finally, the hip-hop track \\"My World\\" is totally cool, and gives us a sense of what a revolutionary and experimental artist Axl Rose truly was, doesn't it?<br />PLEASE COME BACK, AXL!...

B00004TDTO|5.0|Obviously, this film is a classic.  It's one of those movies that everyone has seen at least once.  As far as tension in a suspenful thriller type of movie goes, this one follows the one simple rule.  Don't show too much, imply the source of tension, in this case the shark.  But it isn't just the lurking presence of the fish, it's also the tension and conflict among the three main characters that really drive the film along.  You have Brody's fear of not only the shark, but the water itself, Hooper's even keeled logical attack of the problem, and Quint's Ahabian obsession with the shark.  The cinematography is great, the acting is great, and the script is great.  The shark is merely a cameo player.
B00006AFF5|1.0|Normally I enjoy Ron Howard films, but in this case he should have left well enough alone. &quot;The Grinch&quot; was just fine being only a half hour cartoon, thank you. Since I can't say anything nice about Jim Carrey, I won't say anything at all.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers is the second instalment in the LOTR trilogy of the Tolkien classic. The story continues with the quest in the first movie, but it just gets darker. The first movie we saw the light and the dark in a very discreet manner, but in Two Towers, everyone is in the state of internal struggling. Gollum, the CG character acted by a real actor has more coverage in this second movie and the description of its struggling between the good and the evil is very vivid and heart throbbing. Peter Jackson surely has put in a lot of effort to bring Gollum to life. Frodo is now struggling with the ring that he bears. His mission is to destroy the ring in the fires of Mordor, but at the same time the ring is fighting its will to survive by trying to get control of the ring bearer and seduce him to the dark side. Elijah Wood gave a promising performance as Frodo, though Aragon and Legolas might still be stealing the show a bit. Aragon is now facing the dilemmas of yielding himself to the fate or grip hold to his heart?s resistance. He still chose to fight, but try to avoid the fate as the heir to the incomplete mission of destroying the evil. Legolas tasted the death of his elvish allies and fought with pain in the battle. Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom once again brought these two characters into real life. We can feel the existence of these roles through them. Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchette and Hugo Weaving all have short appearances in this second movie, in which they were not originally in the book. Their parts are mainly to finish off the unfunished plot in the first movie, so that the two movies would be weaved together in a tighter manner. Miranda Otto?s did well as Eowyn the human princess. Her hidden emotions for Aragon were well expressed. Despite she knows that Aragon?s heart is with Arwen, she still tried to do her best to care for Aragon, without the expectation of getting anything in return. She is a well done character but could be sterner and strong, for this was one of the major differences between Arwen and Ewoyn that made Aragon feels something for Eowyn. David Wenham as Faramir did not really receive a lot of attention in the movie, but he is a well known Australian actor, so he could probably receive more attention in Australia with his good performance as Faramir. Without doubt, Ian McKellen gave a spectacular performance as Gandalf the White and it is just an icon of the whole saga. People would expect and enjoy his company throughout the movie. Christopher Lee as Sauraman did not have as much part as the first movie, but it is a good break and wash away form his similar and confusing role as Count Dukoo in Episode II of the Star Wars saga.<br />One thing to be mentioned is that the story of the second movie has quite a bit of change in the plot. Die hard Tolkien fans might find this a bit offended. Basically the whole story is still there, the plot is the same plot, but in some of the details, things were swapped around to produce a more dramatic effect on the movie screen. The whole movie was really well done, and it seems it is more breathtaking than the first movie. However, if people are looking for a real original reproduction on the screen, that could be disappointing for them. The special effects are great and the sceneries are spectacular. No wonder why in my friend?s recent trip to New Zealand, they actually brought them to the location of the movie.<br />This is definitely a good choice for all movie goers, no matter you have read the book or not.s was one of the major differences between Arwen and Ewoyn that made Aragon feels something for Eowyn.

B00005U11Z|5.0|My wife and I have seen the \\"new\\" Journey in concert 6 times since 1998.  We saw the very first Journey concert with Steve Augeri as lead singer.  We were blown away then, and we have been blown away every concert since then.  We purchased this DVD and it was delivered on Christmas Eve, 2002.  We have watched this DVD in its entirety EVERY DAY since then, re-living the absolute JOY that we felt seeing them live the past 4 years.<BR>For ANY Journey fan out there, old or new, DO NOT be deceived by the handful of dissenters who have submitted their reviews to Amazon!!  I can assure all of you that Steve Augeri is a much better LIVE lead singer than Steve Perry EVER was.  His stage presence is incredible, and his incredible vocals do justice to ALL of the legendary Journey songs that we all know.  Although Journey only performed two songs from the 2001 \\"Arrival\\" CD (the first CD with the new lineup) in this Las Vegas concert, if you don't already own \\"Arrival\\",  BUY IT NOW!!  If Sony would have bothered to do at least an AVERAGE job of promoting this great CD, it would have gone platinum.  Steve Augeri has earned the right to be called THE lead singer of Journey.  To call Mr. Augeri a \\"Perry clone\\" or a \\"2nd rate Perry\\" is ridiculous, and very insulting!!  Because of Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo (the \\"new\\" drummer) and the infusion of ENERGY they have brought to the band, Neal Schon, Ross Vallory, and Jonathan Cain are actually ENJOYING themselves, without the iron hand of Steve Perry getting in the way.  When you purchase this DVD and play it for the first time, just LOOK at the happiness and the cohesiveness that has returned to this incredible band.  All of the band members are having a great time, they are all smiling, and they are playing their hearts out.  Journey has been doing EXTENSIVE touring, especially the past couple of years.  Do yourself a favor, and GO SEE THEM IN PERSON!!  Try to catch the VH-1 \\"Behind The Music\\" one-hour special on Journey.  You will all see for yourselves what I am saying.  Steve Augeri fits into this legendary band LIKE A GLOVE!!  I don't know what some of these reviewers were watching, but the concert I saw on this DVD was JOURNEY at it's VERY BEST!!  Buy this DVD NOW!!  Buy \\"Arrival\\" NOW!!  You will NOT be disappointed!!!
B00005JLRR|4.0|I've been following the adventures in the trek universe as long as I can remember.  There are times when I think \\"I could have written that better\\", but then again, who couldn't?  There isn't a movie or book in the world that couldn't be improved upon continueously when you really think about it.<br />The fact is that trek is fun to watch, and there is always some lesson to learn about humanity and it's hang-ups.  When someone gets upset about a seeming inconsistency between stories---I tell them to remember that there are always the gaps between the stories that are ripe for exploration.  Instead of complaining about it, why not write a book about how Worf came back to the Enterprise from his Ambassador's post?  Or a book about how Wesley came back home to Starfleet after time with the Traveler.  I'll be the first one to admit that I'd like to see some of Janeway's D Quadrant experiences reflected in Earth's evolution---but we don't even know whether or not the Reman ship would have penetrated Earth's defenses or not, because they never made it even close to Earth.  Had Shinzon destroyed the Enterprise and continued on to sector 001, we might have seen a few surprises from Janeway's corner.  Picard simply didn't want to risk letting the deadly weapon get any further.<br />Bottom line, Trek is always fun to watch.  Forget the harsh critiques and enjoy the show.  Maybe even write some \\"gap\\" stories of your own.  At least in this world of cookie cutter culture it gets us thinking and talking about something other than those so called \\"reality\\" shows!
B00005JKZT|5.0|this is by far the goodest movie i seen in a long time. i loved it so much cause the acting was good and the action scenes were terrific. it is a wonderful follow up to the masterpiece the fellowship of the rings. i was blown away by the 2 towers because sequels are usually not as good as the first movie, but this one really was.  I loved the 2 towers. it was good.

B00006RU5B|5.0|With the advent of 21st century supergroup Audioslave's self-titled new release, I think it's safe to say that the NEW breed of rock has finally arrived...and not at all in the way that people thought it did with the mediocre-at-best groups like The Strokes and The White Stripes.  I have been a huge fan of both of the incredible bands, Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden, that comprise this supergroup, for many years, but that fact is irrelevant.  As pointed out by many of my fellow reviewers of this album, Audioslave are their own band.  This CD rocks from start to finish...not one single bad song.  Sure, there are some songs that I prefer over others on the disc, but I think we all feel that way about each of our favorite albums.  The combination of Chris Cornell's singular, unmistakable vocal style in conjunction with the pulsating instrumentals from the ex-RATM members (Tom Morello-guitar, Tim Commerford-bass, Brad Wilk-drums) makes for an incomparable force in the modern rock scene.  Some of my favorite songs from this disc are \\"Cochise\\", \\"Show Me How To Live\\", \\"What You Are\\", \\"Like A Stone\\", and \\"Shadow On The Sun\\".  Any rock fan owes it to his or herself to pick up this simply incredible album at any price...believe me, it's worth every penny.
0380977788|4.0|It's easy to see why Coraline is annoyed with her life. Her parents are dull and seem to want her to be just as dull. Her neighbors, including two bizarre retired actresses and an elderly man who seems to think that he can train his mice to perform in a band. She just moved into a new flat with twenty-one windows and fourteen doors. Thirteen of the doors open, and the other one is locked. When Coraline's mother first opens the door all Coraline can see is a brick wall but when Coraline goes exploring and opens the door by herself she enters a dark corridor that takes her to a place both familiar and strange. The place looks just like her flat, but it's different. She has other parents in there that are just lie her regular parents, but their not. Cats talk to people and her neighbors put on shows for audiences filled with dogs. Coraline is fascinated by this new place but soon learns of it's danger. Her not-quit parents want her to stay there forever and change her. She runs away quickly but things are not that simple. Now her parents are missing and Coraline has to play a dangerous game to save their lives, and her life too.<br />Like many books before it Neil Gaiman tells a story about strange new worlds that can exists behind simple objects. The story is dark, humorous, and moves quite quickly, making it a good choice for more reluctant young readers who refuse to read anything but Harry Potter. It's filled with fascinating and frankly creepy illustrations by the talented artist Dave McKean. The only problem I have with this story is it's been done before and the writing, although it attempts to be dark and dangerous, can be a bit too fluffy at times. Still this book is a quick entertaining read that ...

B00003CXXS|4.0|Usually when a film series hits the third sequel, it has all ready run out of steam and becomes a parody of itself.  JURASSIC PARK III does not run into that problem and it even surpasses the second film on all accounts.  The big factor is that a new dinosaur has dethroned T-Rex as the new king predator(Spinosaurus), and that the Raptors are given even more intelligence(compared to that of Dolphins to the point of having communicative skills) than what was shown in the original movie.  The only complaint is that T-Rex loses to Spinosaurus early on in the film.  One would think that the filmakers would set up a confrontation between the two early on, then have a showdown near the end. Also, we find out that Ellie and Dr. Grant from the first JURASSIC PARK (Laura Dern and Sam Neill) are no longer married, but still have a loving, respected, and professional relationship. With that aside, the film pace moves briskly as characters are killed off by the dinosaurs early on such as Cooper (John Diehl-Miami Vice, DC Cab) and Udesky (Micheal Jeter - The Green Mile). The very reliable and likable Sam Neill reprises his role as Dr. Grant again (a role he is so perfect for), and is joined by another reliable and likable actor, William H. Macy (Fargo, Mystery Men), and Tea Leoni.  Also, in the mix, a pre-teen character played by Trevor Morgan who plays the son of Macy and Leoni.  The character is very refreshing because the filmakers make him smart, self reliant, and caring, instead of a rehash of smart alecky, mean-spirited, young teens we see in so many films these days.  Overall, a great piece of entertainment with CGI that is so breathtaking and seamless, that one would think that dinosaurs still exist today.
B00003003R|5.0|Any fan of Axl and the boys will enjoy this excellent live set, which features the best of the GNR repertoire.  Slash plays better than ever, and the rest of the band delivers solid performances throughout.  Axl's voice sounds a bit rough here and there, but it enhances his delivery of some of the finest material in rock history.  Get this one - it's a keeper!
B00000425L|5.0|There aren't many releases of the complete Rachmaninov Preludes. Besides this, there is the now difficult to find Weissenberg performance on RCA. As to which is better, it really depends on what you are after. Weissenberg's is a speed-demon, virtuosic performance which is electrifying, but which also at times seem unpolished and rough. Some of the deep sensitivity of the slower pieces are lost in this, which Ashkenazy captured perfectly in his thoughtful interpretation. In the end this is a very satisfying performance musically, though we could wish for some more pyrotechniques from Ashkenazy. Nonetheless, it is a pity that Richter did not do a complete Preludes. Hopefully Evgeny Kissin, Berezovsky or some of the younger pianists would, especially with Kissin's unbelieveably exciting performance of the B-flat prelude as encore in his Rachmaninov 3rd recording.
0671042858|5.0|I'm a huge King fan, read most of his works, and this one is up there with his best. What makes King such a great writer is he brings the characters alive so well that you feel like you know them. This story is very well paced, beautifully written, and has some great baseball insight. However, I was surprised to see King misspelled Jason Varitek's last name, but whatever, I loved this book.

But anyone who is into other types of music should try this out you won't be disappointed.
6305165912|5.0|At it's heart, I would classify The Big Lebowski as a \\"buddy movie\\" which gravitates into film noire and dark comic bliss.  John Turturro is a scene stealing fiend in this film.  The Dude is a dysfunctional and reluctant hero who is enlisted to solve the mysterious kidnapping of Bonnie, the wife of the eponymous \\"big\\" Jeffrey Lebowski (as played by David Huddleston) with whom he shares the exact same name.  This trial interferes with his normal regimen of league bowling and institutional slacking around greater Los Angeles.<br />  With the support of his inflammatory and chronic sociopath friend (Walter) the Dude enters a meandering and hopelessly complex mystery (in the vein of Raymond Chandler--according to the Cohens) which ultimately proves insignificant.  The tone, soundtrack and mood of this movie blend into a polished comic masterpiece.  This movie has entered the public lexicon and is frequently quoted among devotees.  The Dude abides.
0060194995|1.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of the most overrated and hyped books of our time.  It's an uneven paste-job of short stories and pieces by Harper Lee promoted by her liberal New York publishing friends.<br />Some sections are absurd, such as Ch. 26, where third-grade students in a rural Alabama school in 1935 have a discussion about Adolph Hitler's treatment of Jews in Germany.<br />Without the compelling 1962 film version, this novel might have been forgotten by now.
0345440900|1.0|Tracy Hogg is a gifted sales woman, for sure.  She sells herself and her method constantly throughout the book.  I tired of wading through the egotistical self-congratulations spewed on almost every page.  Overall, I found this book lacking substance.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I bought this album because I ABSOLUTLY LOVE Buffy.  I figured I buy it like I buy tons of stuff because &quot;Buffy&quot; is on it, but then it would only be propped up on a shelf.  But once it got in my player, it never left.  I love listening to it over and over to discover small phases I didn't hear or &quot;get&quot; the first time around.  The tunes are a little weird if you're not into non-radio friendly music, but after a while, you get used to it and find it really enhances the rest of the album.  Plus, the weirdness is just another quirk to what makes &quot;Buffy&quot; so great, the show is unique and innovative.  I recommend this to anyone who likes musicals, quirky lyrics, and/or Buffy.
B00005JL96|5.0|Get this DVD and watch it, twice.  It's worth it.  The story is charming, emotional, and real to life.  People find that they can change, that they have a place in life, even if it's not the same place as everyone else.<br />It's real Hawaii, the wonderful, traditional, somewhat anti-tourist place that I remember.<br />It's scientific fantasy without the endless laser blasts, a family story without the so-called &quot;traditional&quot; family, a love story that includes arguing...  In short, it mirrors the lives we lead, but the mirror is forgiving.<br />Quite a lot for an animation!<br />And of course, it's full of the King of Rock and Roll, and that ain't bad.<br />You will read some review here that pan the movie because it features a less than idyllic family scene.  My response is, thank goodness!  I want the audience to raise it's hands if they've never EVER argued with a sibling...Good, no hands.<br />Great movie.  A keeper.
0670813028|5.0|When I read &quot;It&quot;, my overactive imagination instantly kicked in, and I read for several sleepless nights, gripped by the amazing story.  Since then, I've read and re-read this novel, and each time I'm amazed at how well it flows.  100 pages seems like 10 as King leads you along the path of these teenagers.  Scary and suspenseful, this book is a must-read.
B00005YUTD|1.0|Baby Mozart is great. Baby Beethoven is very good. But as others have noted, Baby Bach is slow, unimaginative, and not worth the money.<br />The most annoying element, by far, is Julie Smith's shameless inclusion of her own kids - dressed and made up in a way that recalls the videos of Jon Benet Ramsey - in segments that have nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the video. It's like some kind of slealth 'video resume' for her kids!
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|Most people considering buying this disc are already well aware of this album as a masterpiece in EC lore.  Thus, the real question is, whether the updated/remastered version of this classic is really worth it. The answer is a resounding YES.<br />I do not have the Ryko reissue, so I purchased the Rhino reissue and did not even have to do an A/B test with the original release to see if I could hear a difference.  The sound is light years better on this Rhino release.  The songs feel much more expansive and there is much more detail.  Songs like Chelsea, Radio Radio, Pump it Up and Big Tears really shine.  Especially if you are used to listening to Chelsea and Big Tears from the Taking Liberties album -- those versions of the songs always sounded muffled to me.  Here they are clean and focused.  You can hear every thump of Bruce Thomas' bass and it is much easier to hear EC's efforts on the guitar (which are too often mixed to the back).<br />The bonus disc is also a treat.  New and fun versions of the classics.  But the first disc is the real gem.  The same songs you know and love, remastered in a crisp, clear and powerful way.<br />Elvis is King.
B00006690G|5.0|Before the song \\"Without Me\\" came out i really didnt like Eminem, but after listening to this album, i'm hooked.Everyone talks about how they like his lyrics or that he's honest and controversial but one main reason could be that he makes good music.I admit his lyrics can be downright disguisting at times, although i feel this album has toned it down a little compared to his previous songs,he's a little less violent and not as insulting on this album, although the lyrics are quite explicit.As i said the music is good and perhaps thats why people like the album, its why i do anyway.There really isnt one song on this album that i dont like except for DRIPS which doesnt really count since eminem doesnt sing a note on anyway. This is a grat album which has made me an eminem fan and i like it because of the music, not coz he swears or coz he's white but coz he's got some awesome pounding funky beats.
B00003CX97|5.0|&quot;The Bridge On The River Kwai&quot; is easily one of the best movies ever made. David Lean is an excellent director. That's why he won the Oscar. The movie deals with the British soldiers who were forced, by Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa, Oscar-nominated) and Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness, Oscar-winner), to build the bridge in the jungle for the trains to cross on the railway, but Major Shears (William Holden) and the other allied men were here to destroy it. The movie is the winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture. I have &quot;The Bridge On The River Kwai&quot; on the 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD and I'm glad to own it. I also recommend other Lean films including &quot;Lawrence Of Arabia&quot; (my favorite Lean picture) and &quot;Doctor Zhivago.
B00000K31Q|5.0|There I was stuck on MEDEVAC standby for a week with 3 sub-25 year olds and only one Television. I envisioned early mornings so that I could watch the news and then they would take over the TV around noon for Games and Teeny-Bopper and T&amp;A movies.<br />The youngest of them rented &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; and popped it in while I was in the kitchen cooking. Since the kitchen overlooks the TV I started watching and became engrossed. The dry humor, the literacy, the plot. It has been said that there are only 50 really good original stories out there and that all others are just variations on each of them. Well, this is the best variation of Taming of the Shrew that I've ever seen. None of the Bard's work has been so well modernized or updated with the possible exception of West Side Story but that is far from modern now.<br />When I returned from the week I rented it and shared it with my approaching 40 wife. She, sappy movie lover that she is, loved it also.
B00005U122|5.0|This dvd is awesome. It should be ten stars.  If you are a floyd fan, this is not just a no brainer, but a true treasure.  If you are just a mainstream top 40 floyd listener, then the different interpretations of many classic floyd tunes may not appeal to you. But if you are a die hard floydian, you will salvate everytime you press play.  From the ancient \\"Set the controls for the heart of the sun's\\" sensually psychedelic vibe to the new \\"Each small candle's\\" socially poignant message and all the classics, you are sure to be pleased. These are all top notch musicians who are amazingly tight as a band, but play relatively loose on the stage.  They are genuinely enjoying what they're doing.  As a lucky person who happend to catch this act on tour the music is as dynamic as I can recall live.  The only knock is the audience seems subdued. The show I saw in Denver matched the intensity on stage and the subsequent feeling was Magic.  Everyone I have shared this dvd with runs out and buys it. Don't miss out, get yours today!
B00005R2M3|3.0|I do like this album, i think all the songs are pretty good and they all have their own unique sound different to the others. But the one thing that annoys me about the album is that 4 of the 13 song are in spanish and not being a spanish speaker i'm really not going to sing along to those songs or listen to them regardless of how good the music is. Basically that means there are only 9 songs on the album to listen to really. I do recommend this album especially if you were a Shakira fan before &quot;WHENEVER,WHEREVER&quot;, which is the best song on this album i think. Overall it's a good album which introduces the western world to Shakira's blend of pop/rock music.
B000002UJQ|5.0|At sixteen all should break off from the traditional route of selecting music (ie. the radio, MTV, and other spoon-fed ) and venture into an unfamiliar sector and start to understand why you like what you like. I suggest buying CDs based on one song. Listen to the whole thing and ask do I like what I hear? Be able to tell yourself why. There is also value in forcing yourself to listen to something because you don't like it. While you may never learn to like something at least you'll know why. And for those elements you find you can enjoy, you'll be less of a pessimist.<br />I bought this album right after it came out and I was beginning to understand what draws me into songs. At sixteen, we begin to break away from home even more. Many have cars which is where I have a relationship with OK Computer. Perhaps it is the technological overtones or maybe simply the line from \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\", that says \\"late at night when I'm driving\\". Personally, I have always found Radiohead to be an urban band with the ability to listen on a back road, along a lake shore as comfortably as in the downtown Chicago. <BR>What makes this possible on OK Computer is the flow of songs. I don't know whether or not Radiohead intends this, but I think one of the most appealing aspects of the album is simply how the songs have been arranged. One of the factors of a five star album is the ability for straight shot listen. Another is the combination of lyrics and musicianship. <BR>I have never found a 5 star album that solely relied on one or the other, unless it was intended to. Weak lyrics can ruin a song as well as a poor composition with profound lyrics. Though some find \\"Electioneering\\" to be the weak spot, I find it as fresh air.<BR>In my opinion Radiohead and other modern groups in the space-rock soundscape have much to compete with on OK Computer. It marked a time in 1990s creativity and lead a genre on the quest for a new mainstream sound. Through it produced many offspring, we all know where it comes from: OK Computer. Anyway, here comes my boss! Good luck.<br />If you like OK Computer try: <BR>Ladies and Gentleman, We are floating in Space - Spiritualized<BR>The Software Slump - Grandaddy<BR>Urban Hymns - The Verve
B000067J1H|3.0|First impressions count, they last, and I think they explain the overwhelmingly positive reactions of the Amazon readership to this film. The first hour of Fight Club is truly, exquisitely, brilliant: patiently (if acidly) observed, witty and deadpan, and the punches it lands - good, solid punches - are of the purely figurative kind. The first hour is nothing like what I was expecting (well, there's no fighting, for a start), so much so that I had to check I actually had the right film. But it was so good, so clever, and so funny that I really didn't mind whether I did or not.<br />So, on the strength of that, sans doubte, five stars: Norton is beautifully understated as the nameless narrator, Helena Bonham-Carter reveals the burned out sex-kitten side of herself that previously I could only fantasise existed, and Brad Pitt, always arch and aware, is as charismatic and magnetic as anyone I've seen on screen. Because he's so cool you tend to overlook the fact that he's an extraordinary actor as well.<br />But doubts began creeping into my mind the minute the first punch was thrown. They took a while to solidify - the game could have gone any one of a number of ways; the violence stayed intermittent and along with the punches there were some interesting (if, er, heavy handed) consumerism vs. individualism arguments getting thrown about, and there seemed to be a Brad Pitt as Jesus thread gathering pace, but suddenly everything went terribly wrong, the narrative ceased making any sense, and this clever, articulate and stylish film devolved into an ultra-violent, but otherwise pretty run-of-the-mill high-octane action movie.<br />What happened? Well, put some of it down to Curse Of The Twist. This is a phenomenon which really only started in earnest with the Crying Game, where the twist made the film; was followed (cleverly) by the Sixth Sense and (laboriously) by the Usual Suspects, and now seems to be obligatory way of finishing off a film where what seemed a great idea when it started turned out not to be (see for example the Shawshank Redemption, Signs, and A Beautiful Mind). Problem here is that the twist completely undoes all the good work done in the first hour of the film. A picture that was making some clever points in a pretty palatable way all of a sudden just doesn't any more. And all of a sudden there are lots of guns and lots of punching. Great.<br />And I'm not sure the twist even works (I'd have to watch it again, and to be honest I can't be bothered): the point of a twist is to give you a set of facts and imply that they should be interpreted in a certain way, and then to reveal the critical piece of information which reveals that everything must actually be viewed another way. I have a sense that some of the facts from the first half don't square with the revised scenario.<br />This was all immensely disappointing, because this could have been a great film - I still think the first 60 minutes is a great film, but I guess if they had stopped there then, on account of the lack of fighting, they couldn't have called it \\"Fight Club\\".<br />Olly Buxtonea when it started turned out not to be (see for example the Shawshank Redemption, Signs, and A Beautiful Mind).

B00000K19E|5.0|In my opinion this is a movie everyone needs to see. Even if you do not like sci fi, you could enjoy the specail effects and creative story. I have to list this as one of the best sci fi movies ever made.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I think the main difference with this album compared to her 1st 2 is that all the songs that havent been released as singles are actually pretty decent.\\"I'm a slave 4 u\\" sounds very different to her previous hits showing she can actually sing a different song and not keep recycling her old songs. \\"Not a girl,Not yet a woman\\" is actually quite good for a ballad from Britney as we all know ballads aren't her best songs. Don't expect anything to different, alot of it is still teen bubblegum stuff, but some of it is alot different.Overall, i'd say its her best album and alot of fun to listen to.
B000002TQV|5.0|Just wanted to see even tho the Bends is from years ago this is by far still one of the best cd's ever made! It's still in my car. Its breathtaking-------- I cant get enough of it!
B00006LFGD|4.0|Usually an artist who insists on giving her listeners lots of bang for their buck, Streisand welches a bit by putting too many previously released songs on this CD. Does anybody NOT have the &quot;Guilty&quot;/Barry Gibb tracks on at least 2 other CDs? And the Judy Garland/Harold Arlen duets reach a little too far back(and sound jarring coming after the more recent songs). I would have preferred to hear Barbra's duet with Larry Blyden on &quot;Wait 'til We're Sixty-Five&quot;(cut from &quot;On A Clear Day&quot;). I did enjoy the Ray Charles duet &quot;Crying Time&quot;(from a 1973 TV special); although it is on &quot;Just For the Record...&quot;, it's loose and fun and Streisand's having a good time. But why include the single-version of &quot;No More Tears&quot; when that hacked-up version is already on &quot;Memories&quot;? For those who have the box-set and are just now building a Streisand collection, this is good as a beginner disc. B+ for the rest of us.
0783231032|4.0|I must say that I had heard MANY things about \\"1941\\" over the years from various written publications and even fellow film nerds. I hadn't seen the film and just took their word that the film was not very good (Yes, I DO read reviews. Critics are smarter than about 90% of the film-going community!) Until one day, I was looking around in a video store when I saw the old VHS box standing in front of me. Since I had nothing to really do that night, I said \\"What the Hell?\\" and rented it. Upon viewing the film, I could see why the film was such a distear. The film is set up to where there is a joke,gag,etc. just about every minute. Some worked great while others simply didn't. I finally finished watching the film and thought over what I had just seen. On one of those rare oscasions, I found myself disagreeing with film critics. I enjoyed the film. It had it's flaws. But there were unfairly pointed out and nit-picked about during the original theatrical release because critics were  gunning for Spielberg to fail. It's a fun film! From the opening \\"Jaws\\" spoof to the exploding credits, you can't help but crack a smile. The DVD itself is quite enjoyable and full of good bonus materials. That includes the great 101-minute documentary \\"The Making of 1941\\" featuring retrospective interviews from strictly the crew of the film (Director Steven Spielberg, Writers Robert Zmeckius & Bob Gale, Writer/Producer John Milius, and others), an extended cut of the film featuring some nice new gags and surprisingly good character development,deleted scenes,trailers,etc. As for the arguments about the DVD's transfer. It's a good transfer. It SHOULD have been anamorphic, but it is still a good print in non-anamorphic. Recommended Film AND DVD.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore has done it again.  I absolutely fell in love with the soundtrack to 'Fellowship of the Ring' and with this, I was no less than thrilled.  <br />For a movie that is so--lightly put--depressing, this music is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.  I saw the movie before receiving this CD, and was brought to tears during the scenes with 'Evenstar' and 'Breath of Life'.  I was likewise teary-eyed when I listened to the CD!  The vocals, of which there are many, are absolutely incredible, and varied on a much larger scale.  Though I love Enya and her performance for FoTR, I think that there were not enough vocals for that soundtrack.  These were perfect.  <br />The string section for 'Riders of Rohan' brings a chill to my spine every time I hear it.  It is repeated several times throughout the album and therefore, you get plenty of it.  This album is the perfect compliment to the perfect movie--it is a must-have companion to it.  There simply is no Lord of the Rings without Howard Shore and his genius score!
B00003CXXO|5.0|After watching A.I. I spent a long time thinking about what I had just experienced.  Only a few films have ever left me thinking so much about life.  Some people believe that if you want realism in a movie then just watch a documentary, not a movie.  I disagree.  Movies are a perfect forum for thought and discussion.  <br />A.I. is worth several viewings and will eventually be considered an absolute masterpiece.  I already do.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This CD is just awesome. It's my fav SOAD CD to date, and unless the next one is damn good it'll always be the best. System of a down has a unique style and i can't get enough of it. One of the best things to come along in rock for a long time.<br />Heres a rundown of what I'd give the songs:<BR>Chic N Stu: 4/5, <BR>Innervision: 4/5(great song, good for single), <BR>Bubbles: 5/5(awesome song, one of the best on CD), <BR>Boom: 4/5(I like the messages they try to get across here), Nuguns: 4/5 (sometimes i find the chorus a bit annoying but it's good), <BR>A.D.D: 5/5, <BR>Mr.Jack: 4/5 (good but i don't see what all the hubbub is, maybe it'll grow on me)<BR>I-E-A-I-A-I-O: 5/5 (best song on CD IMO)<BR>36: 3/5 (short and kind of throws of a rhythm a bit)<BR>Pictures: 3/5 (decent song..)<BR>Highway Song: 5/5<BR>F**k the System: 5/5 (great song, Serj can do some awesome stuff with his voice :P)<BR>Ego Brain: 3/5 (pretty good)<BR>Thetawaves: 5/5 (another great track.)<BR>Roulette: 5/5 (love the acoustic SOAD)<BR>Streamline: 4/5 (solid track, nothing special..)<br />Great CD, buy it now...or steal it..
B00000ILGL|5.0|I grew up listening to the LP, the original recordings. I still have it in perfect shape but the CD is definitely more practical... This is a MASTERPIECE that surpasses all time bariers. Just get a copy of it, have fun, delight yourself, over and over again
B00005N5S5|5.0|Arnold plays as a cyborg,called a termainator, that is a complete assassian.If you love sci-fi action you will love this.Prepare for termaination!
B00007BH5C|5.0|I don't know exactly why some people think this soundtrack isn't awesome... it is! It's as good as the first one, maybe better, if that's possible. What one has to understand is that the music is meant to go with the movie, so all of the sad violin sounds are supposed to add to the visual, and the result is beautiful. This is an amazing masterpiece of auditory pleasure.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This competes with love over gold as my favorite dire straits cd. It's starts out with The tunnel of love (perhaps the best song on the cd), then romeo and juliet, Skateaway  ( got played on the radio way back when , Hand in hand, solid rock ( I have heard it on the radio also), expresso love and les boys. All the songs are solid and good continuity throughout the cd. No real less of tracks on the cd.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I wrote here on Dec25 that I was disappointed when I first heard this CD. I will be humble enough to confess to you that I was wrong. After two more careful listens, it has grown on me... I now depend on this darn thing to feel good... CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?<br />There are a few songs on here that will just make me feel a bit more positive about whatever it is I am doing. Suddenly the noise does not sound like noise anymore, but more like carefully chosen bits of sounds that togeteher compose lovely harmonies.<br />I could not have been more wrong, so I apologize, this is a GREAT album! But this goes to show that it may not seem like such at first glance, it takes a while for one to learn to appreciate this material. It is a sophisticated album, not intended to entertain the easily entertained, no doubt about that.<br />Hope this has been useful.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This cd starts out the epic telegraph road one dire staits best songs( probaly left off of best because of 14 miutes length..this song never drags despite being so long). Second song private investigations ( I think a song about industrial espinoge) another excellent track. Industrial Disease is the thrid track ( got a lot of airplay a goes from the somber mood of the fist two songs to something more light hearted) why it is left off of the best of cd is beyond me..so maybe they can make vol 2 and put it on there. Love over Gold is sort of balladish and another great song. It never rains finishes up the cd in a very solid fashion. Only 5 songs but all are excellent..no fillers here or brewers droop from drinking too much beer everything is lean and mean.
B00007E8V4|4.0|'Steal this Album' isn't much different then their previous two offerings, but it's solid regardless. If your an SOAD fan, go buy this cd, nuff said. Best songs: 'A.D.D', 'I-E-A-I-A-I-O', 'Mr. Jack', 'Innervision', 'Ego Brain' and 'Highway Song'.
0066214122|2.0|The synopsis of this book and the blurbs looked very promising and even after it begins you get off to a good start, but soon this book dissolves into a boring plot that is sci fi at its worst. I've seen this plot elsewhere. I really thought sci fi and humanity would combine forces in this novel to tell a great tale of struggle against a new kind of bad guy and that maybe it contained a message to the future to beware of how far we push the technological envelope. But this promise never fulfilled itself. It's amazing how quickly this book rocketed to the top. I enjoyed CLONED LOVE and SILICON SECRETS by two unknown authors far more than this book and so will you.
B00004STPT|5.0|This score makes you feel every kind of emotion. Hans Zimmer had already struck me with the lion king but this is even more amazing
B000063UR2|5.0|For the reviewer who rated &quot;Legend&quot; one star because her daughter started &quot;screaming &amp; crying within three minutes of the movie beginning,&quot; you should still watch it without your daughter in the room. It's a pretty good movie. Some kids can handle it. Others can't. The rating is PG. Not G. That should've been a heads up.
B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X are THE defintive band in progresive metal right now. Their previous 3 albums were all of the highest calibre, with 2000's \\"V\\" raising the bar to staggering heights. Symphony X decided the only way to follow-up the symphonic prog-rock concept album \\"V\\" would be to do something totally unlike \\"V\\". Thus yields the heavy, speedy, agressive \\"Odyssey\\", featuring songs that are more immediate and heavy-hitting. Guitarist Michael Romeo and Vocalist Russell Allen put in career performances. Russell Allen has really grown with this release, taking center stage whilst providing the album with a great variety of styles and jaw-dropping vocal acrobatics. <br />Opener \\"Inferno (Unleash The Fire)\\" blew me away the first time I heard that opening riff. Michael Romeo amazed me with this riff of stunning complexity and aggression. This riff is like a jolt of electricity coursing through your body. This sets the stage for what will become an album of uncompromising heaviness, complexity and melody. \\"Inferno\\" continued to startle me when I heard the vocals of Russell Allen. He sounds absolutely possessed during the verses... he has never reached this level of harshness and grit in his voice before. It is truly blood-curdling and evil. Allen shifts gears during the chorus which features his familiar crystalline voice in a soaring chorus... truly one of the best choruses I have ever heard. And just listen to the neo-classical guitar/bass duel at the end of the song! \\"Inferno\\" unleashed a fire of musical passion in my body and seared my soul with its unrelenting brutality. This is one of the best songs of 2002. <br />\\"Wicked\\" goes in a different direction with its sexy groove... and I mean GROOVE with a capital G! I have never heard Symphony X groove like this. Michael Romeo provides a catchy little riff while Russell croons about an encounter one unlucky traveler experienced with the evil spirit of a ghostly seductress. <br />Michael Romeo puts on a guitar lesson in the firstminute of \\"Incantations of the Apprentice\\", with crazy riffs seamlessly flowing together. This is a hectic and heavy beginning. This aural overload is not for the faint of heart. This song is also something new for Symphony X, as the verses have sparse guitar to provide a lot of room for Russell Allen to vamp around with his vocals. This song is inspired by Disney's \\"Fantasia\\". <br />\\"Accolade II\\" is the sequel to \\"Accolade\\" from 1997's \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\\". Musical statements from the original \\"Accolade\\" resurface here in the continuing story of the boy warrior who is now a man. Although dealing with the usually cheesy subject of knights in battle, the lyrics are suprisingly poingnant and emotional. I'm sure you will feel something stir deep inside when you hear Russell sing \\"I wish to stay/To be here with you/You were my strength/I cannot go on\\". <br />\\"King of Terrors\\" is a HEAVY track about Edgar Allen Poe's \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\". This dark and evil track takes Symphony X into territory I have never heard them in before, with its slinky opening riff. Russell once again utilizes those HARSH vocals that sound utterly demonic! A soaring, frantic chorus brings this song to a cresendo! \\"King of Terrors\\" also features a completely mind-blowing instrumental workout in the 2nd half. <br />\\"The Turning\\" may be the fastest and heaviest song on the disc. It is about Jeckyll And Hyde and once again has an evil and dark atmosphere featuring some more aggressive vocals from Russell. The main riff in this song just lunges for the listener and shakes the ear drums. Jason Rullo pounds on the double bass drums throughout. <br />\\"Awakenings\\" returns to the symphonic Symphony X sound found on the previous album \\"V\\". This is a slow, majestic and epic piece that builds from a sparse piano intro and Russell's soft vocals searching for the meaning of his existance. It swells into a faster, heavier part featuring some jagged riffing by Romeo. This song features a sublimechorus that reminds me of Kansas, which is a big influence on the band. \\"Here I am at the crossing of life I stand/On my own looking down the road/Hear my cry, answer me/Still I'm searching yet the truth is unknown/Though the night is cold, I walk the road alone\\" It is simply one of the best choruses I have ever heard from Symphony X. This is one of the most emotional Symphony X songs. But the apex of this track is the amazing, extended keyboard feature by Michael Pinella. For most of the album, Pinella's keyboards were tuned down to provide a more subtle complement to the heavy metal guitar attack. But on \\"Awakenings\\", they steal the spotlight. The piano/keyboard solo is quite adventurous and incorporates many styles, such as classical to prog-rock to full-blown jazz (with walking bass!). This song is a masterpiece. <br />The album closes with the 24-minute monster \\"The Odyssey\\", based on an epic poem by some guy named Homer. This track takes you through some of the more important parts of the story such as the Cyclops, the Sirens and the return to Ithaca. This piece is heavy on the symphonic orchestrations, with the first 3 minutes being almost purely orchestrated. It then strips away to reveal an atypically sparse arrangement reminiscent of the lighter moments of Bad Company with Russell's soft vocals opening the story. This song has twists and turns and all sorts of great musical statements to keep your attention. It really flies by. The crowning acheivement is the conclusion, the return to Ithaca. This has an absolutely sublime chorus, \\"Triumphant Champion of Ithaca!\\" It's such a powerful way to close this complex, rich, multi-faceted album.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Gollum steals the movie. That said, here's the least you need to know.<br />The Two Towers is more sweeping in cinematography, and darker in plot than was Fellowship of the Ring. But we knew that going in. Is it as good as the first film? Yes. Did I enjoy it more? No. Perhaps Fellowship provided more the joy of discovery. Towers provides overt, uncompromising, Middle Earthshaking action.<br />Orlando Bloom (Legolas) will once again steal the hearts of teenage girls, however the finest performance (other than Gollum) comes from Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue. Though not a large part, his portrayal is superb nonetheless. Gimli the dwarf is much more entertaining in this second installment, and the humor of John Rhys-Davies (\\"...toss me!\\") is more elaborated. Elijah Wood continues to do a quality job as Frodo, the Shireling hobbit beginning to feel the weight of the One Ring's corrupting influence.<br />One silly inclusion in the film is Legolas' skateboarding down the Helm's Deep ramp while shooting Orcs. Most of the special effects in Two Towers however, are nothing short of spectacular. Gollum is as real as computer graphics can create, although the Wargs were somewhat disappointing. The Oliphants-though featured only briefly, are quite good, and the Ents are even better. Their hurling of the great stones in the spectacular flood destruction conclusion is a highlight, though watching them lumber across Fanghorn Forest brought flashbacks of Jurassic Park.<br />The Battle of Helm's Deep is as good as advertised, however I somehow thought it would take up a bigger part of the film. No complaints though-it is Middle Earthshaking to say the least. Especially welcome are the numerous foreboding glimpses of Mount Doom where the story concludes in the final chapter, and the eerie futuristic death of Aragorn is captivating.<br />Tolkien's passion for religious themes pervade the story, and knowledgeable Bible students will easily spot them. The two natures of everyman (Gollum), as described in Romans 7, and the deceit of unwise council (Wormtongue) are primary examples. The arrival of the resurrected Gandalf (with a `new name') from the east, riding a white horse followed by a great host, is an overt parallel to the return of Christ at Armageddon. So good is the concluding battle in fact, that Helm's Deep seems to be Armageddon, only by another name.<br />In addition to the obvious resurrection theme, the story exemplifies for us the importance of valuing good for the sake of good (as Sam tells Frodo), and makes us recognize that every creature of God (even Gollum) has some redemptive merit. \\"I have to help him, Sam, because I have to believe he can come back\\", says Frodo of the most pathetic and pitiful creature ever to grace a silver screen. (Parents, be advised that Gollum may unnerve small children.)<br />The limits of tolerance (evil must be seen for what it is and destroyed) become immediately relevant to America's fight against terrorism. Environmental awareness is also portrayed as Treebeard references Saruman's \\"mind of metal\\". \\"The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall\\", gloats the evil sorcerer.<br />Finally, the theme of self-sacrifice is not to be overlooked in Two Towers. Tolkien's world is full of characters who give up something precious. Frodo gives up his chance to possess the ring; Arwen--her immortality, for Aragorn, and Sam risks his life Frodo.<br />Yes, computer-generated graphics they may be, but along with the grand and sweeping cinematography across the beautiful landscapes of New Zealand, special effects make The Two Towers a bona fide new-style epic. Pity we must wait a year to watch good ultimately triumph over the shadows of darkness, best articulated by Sam when he tells Frodo, \\"In the end, it's only a passing thing, this darkness. ... There's some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for.\\" A conclusion worth waiting for, and just as importantly-we will finally see the Shelob!ly see the Shelob!
0451169514|5.0|im 14 years old and i didnt think i could even get close to finishing this book but i did...it was awesome! you never want to put it down because you cant wait to see what happens next.  Stephen King did a great job making all the characters indviduals..they seem soo real.  the ending i thought was great. it was exactly what the book needed.
B000002BUY|5.0|This is one of my favorite Incubus cds. I love almost all of the songs. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is an incredible cd and you should seriously consider buying it (especially if you want something a little heavier *Incubus-wise that is*).
B00005O5JV|5.0|Legally Blonde is my all-time favorite movie, I never get tired of it. It is funny, has great jokes, and is well done. You have got to see this. I can't find a better movie.
6305841861|5.0|Ok, this movie is a little over the top, but... you've got to see it! The bonus with all the Evil Dead movies is the commentary! OMG they're so dang funny! They tell you how they did different parts of the movies. (commentary is only on dvd) I own all 3! And I cannot get enough! 1,000 Stars+!!!!
B00005JKZT|5.0|My husband has been waiting all year for this movie. After seeing the making-of dvd's, I got hooked. I actually watch Fellowship without him now. So when Two Towers came out, of course I wanted to go. I just didn't realize how powerful the movie would be. It is better than the first, tremendous, and I was on the edge of my seat for the whole 3 hours. I honestly was not ready for it to end. <BR>  The battle is breathtaking, especially because of all the emotions involoved with all the different characters. I was overwhelmed by these men who clung to a glimmer of hope, and kept going and going, even when swamped in a hopeless situation.<BR>  And of course the comeraderie of Aragorn, Gimli, and all the rest is what keeps it real and makes this one special movie worth watching. I want to see it again!
1559408855|5.0|In the tradition of such timeless family classics as \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" \\"The Sound of Music,\\" and \\"The Mighty Ducks 2,\\" (not 1 or 3, i said 2 you presumptuous freaks) comes a sweet little Italian movie called \\"Salo\\".  Let me tell you, you will NOT find a better movie to watch with your family this or any other year!  It has a little bit of something for everyone... kids being forced to eat their own poop, fascist dicatators, beautiful scenery, kids being forced to eat their own poop....THIS MOVIE HAS IT ALL!!!  You will simply not find another light-hearted comic gem quite like \\"Salo\\".  It is a truly beautiful, life-affirming masterpiece.
1577311523|4.0|It's all about being in the moment. \\"The Power of Now\\" is a profoundly simple approach to enlightenment. Written in a straightforward question and answer format, this book uncovers the simple secret to living an extraordinary life. Simply being in the present without judgment is all that it takes. It is our minds, our egos that make it difficult. When you identify yourself with the drama you have created you lose touch with your truth and your life suffers. This book and Taro Gold's new book of wisdom, \\"Open Your Mind, Open Your Life\\" went out to all the folks on my Holiday list this year! Excellent.
038533348X|5.0|Vonnegut is one of those author's with such a ridiculous cult following that he never interested me.  I've got friends who would bleed for Vonnegut, who would gladly get into barroom brawls with people who slander him in any way.  So I always avoided him: I'm not down with overhype.<br />But I read Slaughterhouse-Five, and it wasn't bad, so I borrowed a copy of Cat's Cradle, as a light read.<br />Holy cow.  What a great book!<br />Cat's Cradle revolves around the concept of lies.  One of the main features of the book is the tenets of Bokononism, a made-up religion that is admittedly based on lies.  The name sake of the book, the Cat's Cradle, is a reflection of lies in society-- There's &quot;no damn cat, no damn cradle.&quot;  Lies in conversation, lies in life: it's an ongoing commentary on it all.<br />So it's about lies.  But it's Vonnegut, so it's not a heavy read, and the prose flies.  It's a book you can finish in a single sitting, and still come away with handy hints on life (&quot;Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.&quot;)  <br />I hate to admit that I'm now hooked on Vonnegut.  But I am.  I don't know that I'd fight for him, but I'd be much more apt to consider it at this point.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I've been a fan of Enigma, and of Sandra (wife of Michael Cretu--the creator of Enigma--whose voice is featured in some of the songs) since the 80's.  Their music will leave you speechless and transform you to a different state of being.  This is very powerful and sensual music.  It's very different from anything that you're ever going to hear.  It's ultramodern with techno and mysterious sounds from medieval times.  The blend of medieval chants by monks coupled with modern techno is absolutely unbelievable.  This is not music for the simple \\"folks\\"--it's music for your mind.  It's not simple to understand and you have to think about it.  This is not the simple rock'n'roll easy and very commonplace silly music.  This is not for everybody--it's for people who like something to feed their souls with.  My favorites are Sadeness (the best song ever from all the music genres--and the video is fabulous--again--you must do some interpreting and thinking to get its message--well, it's enigma--and do you know what enigma means?--exactly), Mea Culpa--you have to understand French and Latin to get the meaning of this---very very powerful), T.N.T. for the brain (very very sexy, and super video--everybody with passion and desire will understand this), and Return to Innocence (the easiest of the songs on the CD---but soooo nice and relaxing).  Again, if you like the simple commonplace tunes that anyone can create, then this not for you.  If you're more sophisticated, know languages, appreciate the unknown, and have a little bit of passion and sensuality about you, then this should really be wonderful treat for you.

B00002R0MC|5.0|Bob marley is the best reaggea artist of all time. This box set contains all the stuff from when he was younger until he was at his oldest. It is hard to get bored of this box set since it contains 4 different cds and they are all very good and have variety alot of variety of bob marley's genius music. I highly recommend this for anyone who just likes good music in general.Bob Marley still lives on!
B00006LLJ4|5.0|Great story, effects, and poses moral questions to the audience. What more could you ask for? Minority Report topped Matrix for me as best Sci Fi movie. Just my humble opinion. Very relavent issues for today: loss of freedoms vs. security!!!
B00006J3WH|5.0|This was the best ever soundtrack ever!! Buffy is just great anyway, but the songs from the musical are fantastic!!! \\"I'm under your spell\\" is really moving and Amber Benson really makes it cool and enchanting. Even though Sarah thinks that she can't sing, she can! Her rendition in \\"Walk through the fire\\" is stunning. I LOVE all of it!! Here's to another equally good version!!

B000070WJE|5.0|As is the case with most RW fans, I'm perplexed by his lack of notoriety in the US. That said, he doesn't seem to bothered by it (check out the 30 min. press conference in Germany streamable from his website) so why should I be? <br />I love the mixing bowl polish of his first two American releases (ego and sing), just good solid pop. Being a rat pack fanatic myself, I was floored by Swing when you're winning and his Live at the Albert DVD... But WOW!<br />This album is just a great rock &amp; roll record. Trademark hooks and melodic brilliance aside, this album is very organic sounding. Acoustic guitars, acoustic drums, keys, and orchestration (placed where it belongs). This is just a bloody great record! If this album is evaluated without the marketing considerations of both the business AND the consumers, everything else becomes irrelevant, it is just a great record.<br />I guarantee I will be listening to this record a decade from now, I will revisit this album periodically, I've no doubt.
B00005ATQM|5.0|I just bought a dvd audio player and picked this up to see if the format delivered.  It does.  All the instruments stand out better, so it's easier to pick everything out even on the stereo mix (things like the shotgun in &quot;the god that failed&quot;, vocal harmonies, etc).  It has a fuller sound to it with the crisp guitars being complimented by warm bass and of course Lars' thundering drums.<br />The surround mix is not perfect but great anyways.  They don't over-do it by going pan crazy, using the rear speakers appropriately in my opinion, but there's a few occasions where it gets a little empty at the sides.  Hard to describe, but sometimes it feels like the hi-hat is beside you, other times it feels like an empty space beside you.  I probably sound crazy so I'll stop now.  Great album, just hope the discs drop in price so the format can really catch on.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Although I still hold Queen at the top, Kansas too, in just as distinct of a way, managed to do what probably under 50 musical personalities have been able to do in the past century; manifest a way to inject (and justify the relevence of) intelligence into music that many people (\\"the masses\\") can grab onto and love.  In other words, commercialism breeds with musicianship.  Leftoverture is one of the greatest albums of all time to deserve such a worthy proclamation.<BR>    Although I have been listening to this stuff ever since my mom has let me (let your kids listen to Aerosmith for God's sake!), I only recently began walking hand in hand with the term \\"prog.\\"  I hate the word, as that in itself is an agent of alientation, and just as ignorantly throwing out the term \\"hairband\\", it refers to an era that \\"had its day\\" and will live in the future only in cult status.  But fine; Leftoverture is prog.  Prog is not a bad word.<BR>    For those of you that don't know, \\"Magnum Opus\\" is a long multimovement piece of music at the end of this album, with great themes, writing, arranging, and ROCKING all at once.  There's basically no vocals.  But just like Rush (though in their own more \\"rootsy\\" style), these folks can perform long jams (either composed or improvised) that will just put you in another world (not TOO far removed from that which Pink Floyd can do).  And this album is the quintissential culmination.<BR>    \\"Carry on Wayward Son\\" is just one of the most mysterious enigmas ever.  VERY similarly to Bon Jovi's \\"Livin on a Prayer\\", this song has AMAZING lyrics, a catchy anthemic chorus, a running time conducive to radio play, pure heart.... and THE BRAINS!!! The guitar solos, the production, the emotion, the MUSIC.... it's all here, and again, the reason music exists.  I bill it as a \\"classic\\", again, very much like \\"Slippery When Wet,\\" although Kansas was more musically developed and adventurous at this point in their career.  Although they became hits for the masses, I have no problem defending either one, just as a teenybopper would a Britney Spears tune (although I think I have more to my argument).  However, with Kansas and Bon Jovi, BOTH just caught millions of fans' attentions, AND had musical merit to back it all up.  Whenever composition and commercialism are at their peaks together, that is when I thank GOD for giving me life.  Why have one without the other?  <BR>     \\"The Wall,\\" track 2 and also present on the hits compilations, is almost just as good as the former song, in my opinion.  Again, AMAZING music, lyrics, emotion, and popular appeal.  God bless Kerry Livgren and co. for being in tune with what so few people seem to be.  \\"Cheyenne Anthem\\" basically walks the idiot through this process for him; 'now we will strum basic chords to get the lowest common denominator to give us a chance, now we will sing, now that we have you captive, we will write some instrumental interlude with our brains.  See?  It rocks, and it still doesn't suck.' I don't know how more clear I can be.  And, I hate simplifying Kansas like that.  There is much to explore and  not much that is always predictable, and they can't be simplified by anyone.<BR>    Buy this album and listen to it a few times to really understand it, as one must do with 98% of any music that's good, and 10 or 20 years from now, you will be amazed at just HOW MUCH you got your money's worth.  I only wish this album had even more than the 2 live bonus tracks they threw in on the remasters.  I'd LOVE to hear some of the unreleased demos.  Cheers all the same, to you, Jeff Glixman.  Get \\"Leftoverture.\\"
B00000IBRX|4.0|The main problem I had with this was that I could understand only about one third of what Sciorra was saying, that is probably because, as my wife is fond of pointing out, most of the world is not as deaf as I am. That said, I suspect what upsets most religionists who have complained about this movie is the idea that one has some kind of choice about where one goes in the afterlife, seemingly. What I find interesting and what I like most about this movie is the<BR>exteriors that were shot in Glacier National Park. I have had the privilege of seeing the park in person. It may not look like heaven, but it will definitely do until something more beautiful comes along......I also liked the part where one of the souls in hell said \\"I only took 30%.)
0380789035|4.0|I think that this book is good.  I think that Neil Gaiman is a talented writer, and his style is unique and lyrical in its own right.  As the title states, the gods of old are alive and kicking on American soil.  Some are swindlers, some are prostitutes and some are crazy. Any person who has a basic knowledge of folklore and stories will recognize them and their avatars.  Norse, Egyptian and Hindi gods are spread out within the pages of this book, and it is quite easy to recognize and define them.  We meet leprechauns and spiders and techo-punks as well.<br />The philosophy of Mr. Gaiman is borrowed from and earlier piece of writing that states--in effect--that all the theological choices and platforms were borrowed from other cultures that brought their dieties here.  As the modern world enroaches upon the territory of the spiritual, the gods have been thrown away and new ones are taking thier place.<br />No longer do people pray to the gods of old and worship them as they used to, now the world is in the thrall of another, more powerful, pantheon.  Credit cards, television and technology have replaced Odin, Asanzi and Anubis as the chosen powers that be.<br />This is more of a moral fable, a cautionary tale spun with great amounts of intrigue and suspense.  Some of the plot threads are a little loose, but they are snapped into place and woven tightly into the tapestry by the end of the novel.  All in all, this novel is a great work of fiction, but be warned, it takes a little bit of work to get through this novel.  That is why the rating is at 4 stars.  I don't like the fact that I had to \\"work\\" to get through this novel, sometimes it really was a chore to read.  But the book is still good.  I have never read a book by Neil Gaiman before, and I think that with the close of this one, I will give a little more thought to his other novels...and a few of them might even find their way onto my bookshelf.
B00006RU5B|4.0|The best thing that happened to RATM was losing Zack De La Rocha. Admittedly Rage had some cool songs but were too serious, too political and Zack couldn't sing, I mean what difference was there between the guy singing and talking? Not a lot. Now with former Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell on vocals and with the new name Audioslave, the band finally show what they're really capable of. The first single COCHISE is musically very close to RATM but Cornell's lyrics give the material a freshness it never had before, there is also some nice melodic stuff and Tom Morello gets more of those crazy, amazing sounds out of his guitar. AUDIOSLAVE is hopefully only the beginning of something great, ironically; a band that will hopefully save rock n roll  from the garbage that is P.O.D and Linkin Park. Now if only the Black Sabbath reunion album with the original lineup gets finished....
B000075BFK|2.0|Not many good songs on this set.  I would really just skip over it unless you have 20 dollars to just blow.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I first approached buying this CD with caution. Sure, the other 2 SOAD albums were brilliant, but what do you immediately think when you walk into the Metal section of the music store and see a CD which has no cover art and looks like a ripped album? Are you going to pay $??.95 for that?<BR>Or is this just a damn clever gimmick? Yes it is. STEAL THIS ALBUM is an album that is well worth your money, and finds the band issuing  previously unreleased material that spans their  career to date. As you would expect, Serj Tankian is in full flight with his anti-consumer song CHIC'N'STU (only Serj could make screaming out the ingredients for casserole and pizza sound cool!) , and the soaring INNERVISION. There is also the nicely anti-authority track F**K THE SYSTEM as well as some gentler songs which will surprise some SOAD fans, but will also delight them too.<BR>By inserting the CD into your computer you can access the album info such as lyrics etc. STEAL THIS ALBUM is a record well worth your money and will please SOAD fanatics both old and new. So if none of your friends or relatives got you this for Xmas (like mine), make sure STEAL THIS ALBUM is the first CD you buy in 2003. Got it?
B00005JKZT|5.0|First of all, I am very disappointed in coming to this site, to find the majority of the reviewers reviewing the movie before it was even released...However, I am not disappointed in the latest Lord of the Rings movie! Instead of a dialogue by Galadriel, as in the first movie, the movie picks right up where the first one left off, like you went out to go to the bathroom or something, and came back in. I will not give spoilers out, but if you are a reader of the books, like me, the movie is still true to the book. However, be warned - not 100% to the book, but it is fine anyway. The Battle of Helm's Deep is phenomenal, and the scenery is perfect, but what stunned me the most was Gollum, without a doubt. At first, I assumed this character would be some computerized figure, like it is. However, he is so REAL! Andy Serkis and Peter Jackson did a fantastic job making Gollum as lifelike as possible. My advice to you is, go see the movie - it is even better than the first, with a better story line, even better scenery, and some much needed laughs, provided by Gimli. Go see this movie as soon as possible!

B00005QDW1|2.0|No Doubt used to be one of my favorite bands a while back, I still had respect for them.. then this came out, it's nothing like the old punk/ska stuff that used to do.. while I've only heard the songs they've taken mainstream, this looks like a total &quot;pop&quot; cd. I just find it amazing how half decent bands sell out and become part of corporate America.. just for more money. *sigh*
B000002ADT|5.0|KIND OF BLUE (1959) has a stark, hushed, understated, but very heady nature, a staggering difference from the previous year's MILESTONES.  KIND OF BLUE went on to become a mega-classic, historic and trend setting.  It introduced modal tunes to jazz, which provide much more space for improvising on each chord compared to conventional jazz tunes and standards.  Consider &quot;So What,&quot; which opens the album.  There are but two chords, D minor 7th and E-flat minor 7th, and there are spots were 24 bars pass, all on the D minor 7th.  This allows the soloist to--as Miles put it--stay in the mode.  The song initiated a wave of influence and inspired a host of modal tunes, including John Coltrane's &quot;Impressions&quot; (built on the same chords and structure).  &quot;So What&quot; also has the very rare instance of the melody being played by the bassist (but this was Paul Chambers; check out his Blue Note album BASS ON TOP from 1957).  For those who don't know, the late Bill Evans is a jazz-piano icon. This brilliant innovator contributed two compositions here: &quot;Blue In Green&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches.&quot;  Bill's hypnotic vamps and harmonically rich voicings add to the heady atmosphere that Miles typically created with his sparse, cerebral style.<br />It's difficult to pick out high points; the whole album is on such a high level.  Coltrane, Adderley, Evans...these guys could play.  The solos throughout are haunting and magical.  All of the compositions exhibit unusual and sometimes subtle characteristics, like the altered blues changes in &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; (on which Wynton Kelly plays piano) and the 10-bar, &quot;A&quot;-section-only form of &quot;Blue In Green.&quot;  In &quot;All Blues,&quot; pay special attention to the harmonic treatment during the last eight bars of its 24-bar blues-waltz structure.  You don't have to be a music student to recognize the unique magic or the mood-inducing power that pervades this album.  With players of this caliber, the music making is magnificent and amazing.  The talent and importance of these truly monumental musicians cannot be stressed enough.  And, the importance of KIND OF BLUE as a record is deserving of all the hoopla that can possibly be mustered on its behalf.  This is a legendary recording by a legendary band.<br />Another reason this album is historic is the introduction of what came to be known as &quot;So What&quot; chords.  They are the chords that answer the melody line in &quot;So What.&quot;  Here are the two chords Bill Evans played there:<br />E below middle C, up a fourth to A, up a fourth to D, up a fourth to G and up a major third to B.<br />D below middle C, up a fourth to G, up a fourth to C, up a fourth to F and up a major third to A.<br />If you're so inclined, try playing those two chords to answer the melody and you will hear the heady magic they produce.  To use this chord elsewhere, just remember it's the root, eleventh, seventh, third and fifth of a minor seventh chord.<br />Cheers,<br />Murrayof this caliber, the music making is magnificent and amazing.

B000005S31|5.0|This album is the greatest ever made by Lou Reed.<BR>Here you can hear that this guy is not only someone who can make (sometimes beautiful) noise, but has great musical talents.<BR>The album forms an unity, the tracks have something in common.<BR>Also his sense of (sometimes morbid) humour can be heard.
B00005YXZH|5.0|There isn't too much I can say since I'm just barely starting to listen to more 'indie' stuff out there.  But there just wasn't any way I could have avoided all the hype about this album.  So far it seems like the raves and replay value are well justified.<br />The first track is the sort of song you need to listen to a few times in a row to get the full effect of it.  Most of the tracks stand out well.  Only a few seemed a little too aimless for my taste, like Pot Kettle Black and some of Poor Places.<br />As for the 'american radiohead' label, I can see why people would think so, but I don't see it myself.
0312962118|5.0|\\"Snow Wolf\\" is a novel by Glenn Meade about the assassination of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. I picked up this book a number of years ago when it was first out in paperback, and immediately the book ranked among my favorites. I read it again and again, enjoying it every time! The depth of historical detail and graphic picture of life in Stalinist Russia is amazing and very, very interesting. As a Russophile and amateur Russian-language student for many years, I found this book absolutely amazing! It definitely is historically accurate and I have no doubt it will rank among the best books you have ever read. Please pick up this book TODAY!!!!!
0440180295|5.0|After introducing himself and his own war story, Vonnegut narrates the war stories of fictional Billy Pilgrim, who like himself survived the firebombing of Dresden, Germany. Like a storyteller commanding his audience's attention Vonnegut begins: \\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\\" He has taken his own true story of Dresden and painted fictional Billy Pilgrim into the frame. But he has also constructed the rest of Billy's life and the devastating consequences of witnessing that massacre. And just as Billy has \\"told\\" it to him, Vonnegut tells us Billy has begun to move freely and involuntarily in Time. He says now that he's done this for years. He says.<br />There is something wrong with Billy and he doesn't know what. He finds himself weeping silently and he doesn't know why. He's almost catatonic emotionally but he doesn't see it. When a barbershop quartet triggers a memory of Dresden and he nearly collapses from the sudden emotional load, Billy begins to understand. \\"Billy thought he had no secrets from himself and now here clearly was a great big one.\\" Not long after, Billy suffers a terrible head injury in a plane crash and begins talking of aliens and time travel and the wonderful things he has learned from the Tralfamadorians: that nobody ever dies but lives on forever in another moment in time. It's not hard to understand how a man who witnessed the massacre of Dresden (among other things) could find himself rationalizing so much death by simply denying that Time exists, so that no one is ever truly dead or gone.<br />Slaughterhouse-Five is well deserving of its reputation as one of the great works of the 20th Century. While superficially farcical sci-fi, the careful reader will find a tale that is devastatingly sad--and not science fiction at all. Billy's madness might seem comic on one level but it is also heartbreaking. Vonnegut's unconventional story structure is richly layered and as fragile as Billy himself, and the time travel allows Vonnegut to relate events from the war against events in Billy's later life directly, in adjacent paragraphs if he wishes, so that as the boxcars of war prisoners move steadily towards Dresden our understanding of Billy's madness becomes clearer until finally the reader is flashing back and forth between the night of the bombing and its aftermath on one hand and on the other Billy going public with his delusions for the first time, explaining time and Tralfamadore to a late-night radio audience many years later. (And unconsciously borrowing details from Kilgore Trout to flesh out his story.)<br />Vonnegut's prose is flawless, handling the strange structure with utter clarity and weaving together a devastating and subtle fictional portrait of a man unglued with an important factual historical document about Dresden. In war scenes Vonnegut refuses to make heros out of anyone. These soldiers, for the most part, are babies, teenagers, lost and starving and freezing to death far from home. There are no parts for John Wayne, as the author says. By the same token Slaughterhouse-Five doesn't need to create a laughing nut out of Billy and his delusions, and Vonnegut doesn't try to. This is a character whose humanity has been completely destroyed by the violence and death he has witnessed. He emerges helpless and plaintive, wanting desperately to understand. And while his new understanding of Time may have amusing qualities, at it's heart it is profound sadness. We weep silently with Billy, both for him and for ourselves.
B00007E8V4|5.0|When I got this CD, I thought it would be pretty weird, considering it was the B-sides of an already strange band. It is strange, but in a super-good way. It knocked me out to think that they put Bounce on Toxicity and not Innervision,ADD, or I-E-I-A-I-A-O. The CD doesn't feel like a compiliation of songs that didn't make the cut, but a well thought out, highly selective CD.<BR>Good tracks: all of them.<BR>Bad tracks: ha! just kidding.
038533348X|5.0|Are humans foolish enough to turn a gentle geniuses' idle curiosity to the end of the world? Cat's Cradle isn't anti-science, it's anti-people. This is a richly comic motley crew of characters and situations that forget plausibility in the service of the high art of low comedy. K.V. takes a stab at religion, industry, dictatorship, science, poverty, cold war espionage, the military, classism, love and devotion, and as always human foolishness and folly.<br />The pace is quick, witty and full of more unexpected turns of plot than so few pages have a right to. All of it skewers with perfect timing and aim. Vonnegut's wild, satirical side at the edge of control. Classic.
B00006L83N|5.0|My only previous experiece with Symphony X was Devine Wings of Tragedy (1997), which I was good enough for me to pick up a second album, but not excellent by any means. But its surprising how much the band has improved between 1997 and 2002.<BR>Odyssey, along with Dream Theatre's Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance, Ian Anderson's Secret Language of Birds, David Bowie's Heathen and Peter Gabriel's Up, is among my top five albums released so far this millennium.<BR>Its not an easy album to get into. You can't just put it in the CD player and enjoy it straight off. It takes a few listens for it to burn into your memory (so to speak) but once you get into it, it'll probably remain in your CD player for a long, long time (The only reason I decided to put it aside and listen to something else for a while was because I was getting a headache from the heavy bass drum after repeated listens).<BR>The first track is probably the weakest as far as songwriting is concerned, although its probably the best choice as an openner. Wicked is better but it is with Incantations Of The Apprentice and Accolade II that the band begins to shine.<BR>King Of Terrors is another good aggressive song, similar to track one, but much better.<BR>The Turning and Awakenings are probably two of the easier tracks to get into and the magnus opus The Odyssey is the album's key track and, aside from the song's second movement, probably the hardest to get into. I'm not very familiar with the bonus song, because I tend to skip over it for some reason, so I will refrain from commenting. I'm not saying its bad because I haven't really given it a chance.<BR>Anyway, if you want good modern prog music buy this! As good as Dream Theater, better than Spock's Beard.
B000066F6H|3.0|These tracks on this CD are certainly not inconsistent.  The CD succeeds in delivering an enjoyable collection of high-energy, fast-paced, VERY similar-sounding, songs.  But I suppose there is no crime in that.  <br />I did notice that the band's sound is quite similar to that of Iggy and the Stooges.  In fact, the Hives may very well have modeled most of their songs after \\"Search and Destroy\\" alone.  From the vocal style to the distorted guitar to the lyrics themselves, this band does the Stooges very accurately.  This does not mean, of course, that the CD is no good.  On the contrary, it is a fun album that does not take itself too seriously.
0385720920|5.0|I happened to stumble upon this book by accident... or was it destiny? Anyway, I quickly realized that Palahniuk was the author of Fight Club and instead of getting that book (having seen the movie already), I decided to go for Choke. And what a wonderful choice I had made! I devoured the book in two days and the thing that stroke me the most was how much I related to the book. No, I'm neither a sex-addict nor do I work in Colonial Dunsboro; I was raised by a single mother. I quickly related to Victor in the sense of having to be attached to your mother in more ways than one: you hate her and love her for that very reason. I don't know whether Mr. Palahniuk was raised by a single mother as well (after reading Fight Club & Survivor I could almost say he was) but the way he presents the mother-son relationship is so genuine and honest that anyone raised by both parents can quickly relate to Victor's story. In Choke, Palahniuk reminds us that without a \\"damsel in distress\\" there can be no \\"knight in shinning armour\\", and that we have the power to choose between both roles. As with Palahniuk's other works, this book discusses several subjects among them hope. Let us never forget that life is what we make of it and that we'll always have the power to change the course of our lives as long as we have hope and the will to change it.
B00005QFHG|5.0|Whether as an afternoon teatime snack, quick pick-me-up at work, or Halloween treat, chocolate has become a staple in America.  This movie is about chocolate, but about its use as a healer and its power to \\"unlock hidden yearnings and to shape destiny.\\" Figures, since depression can be alleviated by chocolate.  And the creator of this confection in this extremely palatable movie is a healer herself.<br />Chocolat tells the story of two people who descend upon a provincial French village in the wake of a sly and strong north wind.  Those two people are Vianne and her young daughter Anouk.  Oh, perhaps I should say two people and an animal.  Anouk has an imaginary friend, Pontouf, who is a kangaroo.  She sets up shop, a potisserie, and opens it during Lent, not exactly perfect timing in a God-fearing village whose inhabitants believe in calm, tranquilitee, to use French.  Basically, knowing one's place, being obedient to authority, and going to church on Sunday are the pillars of this French village.<br />The idealist and romantic Vianne comes against the extremely conservative mayor, the Comte de Reynaud, as well as most of the people here.  She doesn't wear black, doesn't go to church on Sundays, and (gasp!) is an unwed mother.  She is also the only one who accepts Roux, the handsome leader of raft-bound river rats the town shuns as being immoral.  As a wanderer herself, Vianne naturally finds affinity with the riverfolk.<br />Before long, things start happening in the village.  People who buy her wares become more loosened in attitude, more courageous, and in the case of one married couple, saves their marriage with a rebirth in their sex life.  She also helps her landlady establish ties with her grandson, who has an affinity for drawing morbid pictures.  Basically, her altruistic spirit helps spread friendliness and helps certain townfolk relax from their hidebound ways.  Vianne gains the enmity of the mayor who sees her as an enemy, and seeks to drive her away by having sermons against temptation and of the powers of Satan concealing first a veiled, later an open attack against her wares.<br />This will be the ultimate Juliette Binoche film for me, and my favourite movie of 2000.  (OK, I know it came out in '99 but it came to my local theatre that year.)  I must admit I was torn between her and Julia Roberts as my Best Actress choice for 2000.  I've seen Alfred Molina play a large variety of roles, be it as Kenneth Halliwell (Prick Up Your Ears), Satipo (Raiders Of The Lost Ark), and most recently, as Diego Rivera in Frida.  His portrayal shows he can act as a diametric opposite of Rivera, an uptight, stuffed shirt traditionalist.  Lena Olin gets kudos as Josephine, a misunderstood kleptomaniac in a trapped marriage who follows her own drum.  Naturally, she is one of the first to befriend Vianne.  Judi Dench as Armand the landlady, and Peter Stormare as Josephine's odious and abusive husband also shine out here.<br />Chocolat also shows two things:  One, we need more people like Vianne to heal us.  Two, we need something to heal us, and no, I don't mean with standards such as religion or money, but something else that fills us within.  This movie's a nice confection that isn't sickly sweet or mere coloured sugar, but something with a rich flavour that will leave one's stomach glowing inside.having sermons against temptation and of the powers of Satan concealing first a veiled, later an open attack against her wares.<br />This will be the ultimate Juliette Binoche film for me, and my favourite movie of 2000.

630521610X|5.0|Scream is one of the more original horror movies of our time.  Yes, it is another slasher film, but it also opened up a whole new realm of fear.  It made the &quot;killer calling the victim before she/he dies&quot; routine a much more popular event.  The killings were rather unique... I mean how many movies have a girl get crushed in a garage door without making it look totally corney... but... Wes Craven and the rest of the Scream crew pulled it off so it was actually scary... something that many horror movies lack these days.  Scream is like the original &quot;Halloween&quot; film of the 90's  Overall I would say Scream is an excellant horror film and I would recommend it to any other slasher movie fan.
B00005JL96|5.0|Ah, Lilo & Stitch, the movie that answers the question \\"What would happen if George Lucas, Hayao Miyazaki, and Joe Dante all collaborated on a film.  Lilo & Stitch takes on the old idea of \\"child befriends strange creature\\" and gives it a refreshing and quirky twist.  Sort of like taking E.T. and replacing E.T. with one of the creatures from Gremlins.   All in all, \\"L & S\\" does not remind me of a Disney film.  It seems more like something that either Warner Brothers or Dreamworks would produce.   I have seen quite a few negative reviews by the Disney \\"purists\\" out there complaining of its violence and lack of warmth.  They miss the point!  This is not supposed to be a typical syrupy musical puke-fest Disney typically has released in the last decade. Lilo and Stitch would really be recommended to fans of the nontraditional Buena vista releases such as \\"Nightmare before Christmas\\" and \\"Roger Rabbit\\" (both underappreciated films in my opinion) as well as the works of Miyazaki and the oldschool anime of Tezuka Osamu. (even the characters have Tezuka's familiar stumpy looking qualities)  The story begins rather abruptly with no opening credits until about 10 minutes into the film.  In a far off galaxy, a genetic scientist Jumba Jookiba is standing trial for illegally creating a genetic experiment which he calls \\"experiment 626\\".  626 was designed to be an indestructible weapon of mass destruction (even though he's only 3 feet tall, looks like a blue koala, and sounds like the Andy Kaufman character Latka).  Most surprising about Lilo & Stitch is that most of the time, you can't be sure that you are actually watching a Disney movie.  The film is notably violent by Disney standards and most of the humor can be quite dark at times.  Most noticeable is the absence of traditional Disney musical numbers and cute anthropomorphic animals.  Stitch is a cute alien, but he is also hell-bent on destruction for about the first third of the movie.  As far as Disney films go, Lilo & Stitch has to be one the most realistic I have ever seen.  Lilo's character is the most realistic portrayal of a child in a Disney animated feature.  She is not excruciatingly cute for cuteness sake and she actually behaves like a real child.  She (nor any other character) is allegorical and is not completely good or bad.  Each character has their flaws.  Lilo can be a brat and she can be mean to others but she always tries to love her sister and Stitch.  She always has the patience to put up with Stitch's destructive behavior.  Interestingly enough, she also seems to be the moral center of the film.  When her sister Nani has had enough of Stitch's unpredictable behavior, she threatens to throw him out.  Lilo has to remind her that even though Stitch is less than admirable, he is still family and repeats the movie's catchphrase \\"family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten\\".   Stitch, even though from the beginning is a destructive little demon, he evolves throughout the film.  He learns about having a family, something he has never had.  He was genetically created with no greater purpose other than to be a one-alien wrecking crew.  As he continues to destroy, he finds out that nobody likes him because of that, eventually even Lilo, the one who saved him from being captured by his creator.  During the second-third of the film he goes through a massive inner conflict between his genetic programming to destroy and his discovery that he could serve a greater purpose and that he is actually loved (at least by one person).  The Elvis soundtrack is a delicious change of pace instead of musical numbers and the songs of the king are often used for amusing montages.  This is also one of the funniest Disney films I have ever seen.  Lilo gets all of the best lines with her deadpan and childlike innocence in her delivery of her bizarre and sometimes disturbing humor.  Meanwhile, Stitch gets all of best visual gags and physical humor. Some of the funniest moments are: Stitchfrequently becoming frustrated and destroying everything he touches, the Elvis montage where Lilo teaches Stitch to become a model citizen like her hero Elvis Presley, some of Lilo and Nani's sisterly quarrels (they fight like real siblings), the exchange of dialogue in a scene where Stitch and Jumba toss back and forth a plasma cannon that is about to explode, and Stitch driving a gas truck into a volcano to use the explosion to propel him like a jet pack. The jokes and gags come fast and furious throughout the first 40 minutes and reaches an arc of melodrama in the middle followed by the funny and action-packed final third.   <BR>Ultimately, Lilo & Stitch is a story about acceptance, redemption, and redefining the concept of family.  This film takes the outdated 50's concept of the nuclear family, throws it out the window and replaces it with the more modern and realistic concept of \\"family is where the home is\\".
0066214122|1.0|not much to say, his most recent book is the most disappointing yet, and i have read them all.  the overlay of the house dad dealing with his children's problems while saving the world is just silly.  the technical stuff too technical for the average reader, i think.<br />I probably will not buy his next one.

B00005JKZT|5.0|I've seen The Two Towers twice since its arrival in the theaters, and believe it to be better than part 1. Part 1, excellent as it was, is an introduction of characters and milieu, the terrain rising toward the story that lay ahead. This second installment ascends to the plateau and delivers a Romantic vision of epic proportions. It equals in sweep, gravity and visual and emotional impact any epic tale that has ever been put on film.<br />For once, something hyped and oversold lives up to all the claims made for it by waiting fans and the films makers. Please understand, I am not a Tolkienite. I have no vested interest in selling this series. But take the word of an unbiased viewer: it IS an awe-inspiring, frightening, sad, stirring, funny film. It's about hope, faith, love and obsession. It is a film that makes you CARE. For that alone, it's a treasure.

B000002H2H|5.0|What is a heavy metal collection with out any MetallicA cd...especially this one.  Why some people ask because this cd is packed with hard hitting music that must be played so loud your speakers blow out.  This is music that gets you ready for war.  Personally my favorite song is Creeping Death because it is a story lived through the song.  But most importantly For Whom the Bell Tolls still gives me the chills after 12 years of having it.  It is a must for any true metal head.

B000062X9B|4.0|De verdad que se siente la sensacion de estar en un bar, con el whisky en el vaso y mucho humo de cigarro en el ambiente a altas horas de la madrugada y estar viendo tocar a johnny solo en el escenario. Este tipo que al grabar este disco tenia 69 aos, con voz carraspeada y su guitarra de palo le da un ambiente o sensacion de taberna a su musica como pocos lo saben hacer, con una melancolia infinita en canciones como &quot;solitary man&quot;, &quot;I see the darkness&quot; o &quot;the mercy seat&quot;. La primera vez que escuche este disco quede como en estado de shock ya que nunca en mi vida habia escuchado a un seor con solamente una guitarra de palo y voz hacer musica tan increible y con una intensidad que nunca espere de un sonido tan simple. Canciones como &quot;I won't back down&quot;, &quot;field of diamonds&quot; o &quot;before my time&quot; tienen una onda country muy remosada en la que se siente la vibra de la musica surea tradicional estadosunidense, pero con toques folk. Este disco me abrio mi espectro de la musica country y folk, especialmente en lo que consierne a musica acustica, ya que lo que mas escuchaba de este tipo eran los unpluggeds de algunos grupos grunge que me gustan o el &quot;book of shadows&quot; de Zakk Wylde hasta que escuche el american III : solitary man, y descubri a Neil Young, a Bob Dylan, Tom Petty y muchos genios mas, incluso hasta a Cats Stevens. Exelente disco y exelente artista Johnny Cash.<BR>Por lo unico que no le doy cinco estrellas es por que la primera parte del disco es demasiado buena y la ultima parte como que se cae mucho al country, pero nunca dejando de ser buenisimo, pero de todas maneras un disco para nunca olvidar. 100% recomendable
078401213X|5.0|A mathematician on the threshhold of madness tries to come up with the \\"magic\\" number that will crack the secrets of Wall street. To do this he lives in a \\"world within a world\\" of his own where his personal (and almost alive, brings to mind HAL) computer is the size of his room and where he seems to be cabled-in with it as he tries for the breakthrough. <BR>    But simoultaneously, the number he's looking for seems to be of great importance for a sect of Orthodox Jews who consider it to be the one that will unlock the secrets of god as well.<BR>    Metaphysics meet science and science meets insanity in an incredible film that has already earned characterisations that range from classic to cult.<BR>   And for good reason too. Shot entirely in black and white and on very low budget \\"Pi\\" reminds everyone that independent cinema remains the only true hope for the thinking viewers. The main character (you've never seen him before but you will agree he's a perfect match for the role) is ultra-convincing and the few other characters that appear are carefully casted and compliment the movie as well.<BR>   Allthough i'm not aware if \\"Pi\\" won any awards for photography i would be shocked if it hasn't. Camera and photography-wise the film is an undisputed masterpiece. The director and crew have done an astonishing job to capture the claustrophobic story and throughout one has the feeling that he's watching this whole thing from up close. <BR>   Numerology freaks as well as conspiracy theorists will have a field day with this as it's full of references from beginning to end.<BR>   Some have criticised the ending, but think about it: how could you possibly end this film in a way that would \\"universally\\" satisfy the audience??? You simply can't. If you would that'd mean that you would have to come up not only with a great film but with the equation to end all equations as well, and i mean, come on, we're asking for a bit too much here.<BR>   As i watched it i thought (halfway during the movie) that the end would be critical but eventually i realised that this is besides the point, as \\"Pi\\" intends to serve more as food for thought rather than offer answers. It intends to show a stranger's struggle for answers so it could function as a mirror for anyone seeking similar answers too. And it manages that in a very eerie way. It also intends to provoke and create controversy around itself. After all what \\"Pi\\" deals with is existentiality, and as such it is bound to ask a lot but not be able to answer everything.<BR>    As if everything concerning this brilliant moment of cinema wasn't good enough the soundtrack is a treat too! True, it's not as intimidating as when it came out (thing have moved on a bit since then) but for those that have not discovered the beauties of the electronic scene it will be a chance for them to delve and find out about gems that have eluded them.<BR>    This is easily one of the top films within the last 10 years and ranks way high on the list in its genre.What genre is this?<BR>    Well how about \\"science fiction-thriller-social commentary-drama\\"? <BR>    Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
6305232660|5.0|Possibly the finest end of the world film ever made. The only competition might be George Pal's When Worlds Collide. The manner in which the Director, Mimi Leder fashions this tale is unique. This film is not a fast paced, slam bang action thriller. There is no hyped up rock score, ala Bruckheimer, to keep the film at an artificial pace. Instead it reaches down into the human heart and draws us into characters and events that are at times thrilling, at times heart breaking. The scenes of destruction are terrifying, made more so by the depth of the characters that get swept up in the cataclysm. And by the fact that special effects are there to enhance the story, not carry it. This is a beautiful, spiritual, and elagic tale of humanity on the brink. You will be rewarded in many ways by the experience of this film. It is a true classic.

B00005V0X5|5.0|This is megadeth's first cd remastered so it's sounds better. It's got the seven orginal tracks plus four bonus songs. The album is great and i have no complaints. It's fast, heavy, and full of awesome guitar solos, great drumming, and excellent bass.  This cd is quick, probably one of the best examples of thrash you can find.  You can tell by the lyrics that Mustaine was just having fun with cd.  Later on in their career, they became obessed with beating metallica but as of right now, they are just playing for the sake of metal.  The drummer and guitar player on this album were both influenced by other types of music, such as jazz.  Though still metal, the drums and riffs don't have that sleezy metal sound, much more focused even if it a debut.  <br />The music is a dark contrast to the lyrics: the music is fast, tight, and mature and the lyrics are often times very funny and immature.  Dave's voice is very raw here, even by his standars.  His vocals are more spontenaus and \\"out there\\" than other releases, giving this cd a true punky, frantic feel.   The problem is that the bonus songs [stink] and are pointless. The first bonus song is these boots. Musically, it is great. However, it is edited. Your listening to it and having a good time then suddenly there is a BEEEEEEEEP so they edit the cussing. This is very dumb and it ruins the song. I can't even listen to it now. Oh well, it's a bonus so I really don't care that much :)<br />The next three bonus songs are demos. Who cares about demos? I have the real deal on the rest of the cd so why would I want to listen to the demos? That' slike buying a dvd and it includes the movie trailer with it. Why???? I have the movie right here, there is no point in the trailure.
B00006ADFL|5.0|Peter Jacksons Heavenly Creatures is one of the most astonishingly original achievements in film in the last ten years, it is both rapturous and inspired in mood and detail, and the script, direction and performances are flawless, no other film-maker has ever caught so vividly the wild and recklessly volatile terrain of adolescence, it is both dark and exhilarating and the final scene is so beautifully executed it is almost unbearable to watch, a remarkable film that gives the genius and insanity of the human imagination full expression, Love it!!
B00004Z459|2.0|This cd is ok, but once you listen to it a few times, you realize that its all kinda fake.  The lyrics are pretty awful as well.  Usually, the songs start out good like With You, but go downhill from there.  This band really is pretty shallow and there's no real meaning in their songs.  If you're thinking about buying this, I'd say don't waste your money on this bland album and buy something real.
B00005JL96|1.0|Lilo and Stitch is not the clever and entertaining feature that I had expected.  I had read some of the other reviews and thought that it might be another multi-age-level \\"classic\\" like some other recent personal and family favorites:  Emperor's New Groove, Monster's Inc, Toy Story, or maybe even along the lines of Shrek.   I was wrong.<br />We are introduced to Stitch, an alien genetic experiment gone wrong that crashes to earth and is placed at the local dog shelter.  Lilo is a young girl first introduced as a child that cannot get along with any friends, lives without parents, is left home alone, and cared for only by her older sister Nani.   The story is further complicated when we are introduced to Nani who is threatened (once again) by the social worker who is going to remove Lilo from the house if things don't improve.  The two stories collide when Nani's solution to Lilo's behavioral problem is to adopt a pet where, of course, Lilo picks Stitch.  Finally, throw in some alien authorities chasing after Stitch and a young boy interested in dating Nani.  <br />The story involves our cacophony of characters chasing one-another to the unbearable end when everything works out so that everyone can live happily ever after in the typical Disney way.  The story is original by its convoluted nature and the moral to the story is essentially that when it comes to being a family, anything goes.  Not in our household, I don't think that Lilo and Stitch will be in the DVD player again, nor will there be any requests from our 5 year old.  I found the story and characters to be a bit disturbing and set a poor example.  If we decide to watch a bad movie, we will stick with the other recent Disney examples that maybe are not so \\"original\\" such as Pocahontas and Mulan.

Although I haven't been a fan of TATU very long, when I first heard their music, I knew it would be popular. I highly recommend buying this album if you like pop, Europop, or dance/techno.. If you're still not sure, try listening to clips of \\"All The Things She Said,\\" \\"Not Gonna Get Us,\\" or \\"Show Me Love.\\" All the songs have great chorus and pretty beats :D For more information, you can go to the official TATU site ...
B00006CXSS|5.0|I received this series today for a Christmas present.  I have watched the 1st 3 episodes with great interest.  Because of my young age at the time(18), I was in boot camp when D-Day started.<BR>I survived because I was born a couple of years late.  Pure chance.<BR>Mr Diaz of Miami, Florida: if your TV is older than 1993 it will not pick up CC.  I must have CC because I am quite deaf and wear hearing aids.  Band of Brothers does not have its own CC; you have to pick it up with the CC on your TV.  Good luck in your endeavors;  they are commendable.  Bill from Oceanside, CA.
B000002NHN|5.0|I almost didn't write a review,because there are a lot of them for this cd. I still will not write a &quot;proper&quot; review. I just had to shout from the top of my lungs how utterly enchanting and amazing this music is!!  Celtic, Middle Eastern  and god knows what other musical worlds are beautifully woven into this incredible music. And Loreena's voice is simply magical. For a more detailed description, read the other reviews...I don't care if this one is &quot;helpful&quot; or not. I just wanted to say that LOREENA MCKENNIT'S MUSIC IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL YOU WILL EVER ENCOUNTER IN THIS LIFE!!
0385508417|4.0|John Grisham is such a great writer. He knows exactly how to keep you interested throughout the whole book. It's a nice change of pace from most of his other law themed books. I found Skipping Christmas a very easy read. A great book to read over the weekend, perfect size!
B000063S6Z|3.0|A little disappointed. A few good songs, but not an overall great album
0066214122|3.0|First 3/4 of the book is interesting and semi believable. but it just gets to silly at the end and ruins it all.
0345440900|2.0|I read this when I was pregnant and thought it was sound advice, but after I had a baby I realized the book should have been thrown out the window.  Maybe British babies and American babies are different or something, but I could never get my baby back to sleep in the middle of the night by patting her on the back.  The thing I found was true is the E.A.S.Y routine, which my baby fell into on her own - I didn't make her do it.  So, the author acts as thought she invented it or something.  I'm sure that many mothers use it like a baby Bible, but I just found it to be ridiculous.
B00006J3T4|3.0|If you are expecting Dire Straits, or an album full of songs like Way Aye Man and Dont Know Your Born, you will be disappointed. Its not bad, but not what I expected after hearing the two mentioned songs on the radio. Fortunetly I have a burner and can salvage the 2 or 3 songs I like before I take this one to my favorite used C.D. dealer and trade it in. 3 stars is generous, 2.5 is more like it.
0385508417|1.0|When you finish reading all you can think about is why the author didn't skip chapter 3-18 and go straight to the end. the &quot;heart&quot; of the book is so boring and predictable you will not believe you actually spent your time on it. Such a dissapiontment. maybe grisham should stick to the law books.<br />the story just develops nowhere. an absalout waste of time if you ask me!
B00005JL96|5.0|This is truly a new Disney Classic with powerful music, absolutely adorable characters, and a heartwarming message.  We saw the DVD and then bought it for ourselves for Christmas and gave it to our friends. You don't need kids to enjoy this film, you just need to love movies that will make you laugh, make you sing, and pull your heartstrings.  You want to teach your kids about Family Values? Sit down and enjoy this together.  Watch as Experiment 626 (a real missfit creature of destruction) slowly migrates into a new identity (the loveable Stitch - Lilo's Pet) and finds his place in the universe. Stitch is by far the most entertaining Elvis impersonator to hit the stage!  This movie is right up there with the Lion King as a Disney Masterpiece. Put it in the Vault!
B00006JIZP|4.0|Hey this cd is quite good.  It's really a 3.8 or something close.  Coldplay-lite. Gone is the old crunchy Nada Surf of &quot;Popular&quot; and Pixies covers.  Here it is often times soft and acoustic; other times Matthew Caws and Co. rock out fashionably and with focused energy.  Despite sharing the same album name as mainstream teen star Avril Lavigne's latest cd, the songs on here are well crafted and each has its highs and lows.  Standout tracks are &quot;Inside of Love&quot; &lt;reminiscent of Coldplay&gt;, &quot;No Quick Fix&quot;, &quot;Killian's Red&quot;, &quot;Happy Kid&quot; and &quot;Paper Boats&quot; &lt;my personal favourite: the quiet closer - the climaxing harmonies are simply sublime!&gt;.  As a whole, it's pretty accessible.  I mean, even my friend who only likes &quot;catchy&quot;, mainstream music loved this one.  Great for relaxing.  Save your $ and buy this when it comes out in America in February 2003.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|...how many time you can go back to it&quot;, then &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is probably somewhere up on the list of best movies ever, because you can watch this movie literally 10, 15 times and still find yourself noticing weird little things that even tend to upset your &quot;explanation&quot; for it. Who cares about &quot;understanding&quot; it anyway? How about the fact that there's a DEMONIC RABBIT in it for God's sake? I personally think this may just be the best movie about adolescence and youthful alienation ever. As bizarre and unlikely as Donnie's story is, you feel like you can relate to it, because it simply embodies the confusion and anxiety of being a teenager in extreme form. It's a beautiful movie.
6305882592|4.0|...Hal Ashby (perhaps the greatest forgotten American director of the 1970's) spins a perverse, yet oddly touching love story of two misfits.  Harold is a privileged teenager from a wealthy, well-connected family who also is extremely lonely and has an extraordinarily morbid fascination with death and suicide.  Maude is the cheerful, free-spirited 79-year-old woman who lives alone in a trailer and gets Harold to lighten up and enjoy life.  <br />Even though it would appear at face value that these two have nothing in common, they find a common bond in the fact that both of them are oddballs who don't quite fit into their surroundings.  Although their falling in love is strange, it is touching to see Harold--a sullen, hearse-driving kid who is almost completely alienated from the outside world--finally connect with someone who both understands and truly cares about him.  Needless to say, their budding romance doesn't exactly tickle the fancy of Harold's parents--especially his cold, distant mother.  <br />While \\"Harold and Maude\\" is a story that is eccentric and quirky enough to interest moviegoers today who perhaps don't want the standard Hollywood schlock, it should be noted that certain aspects of this movie are a little dated:  namely, Cat Stevens' songs (catchy and appropriate, but cheesy) and Harold's visit to his comically disabled uncle in the U.S. Army, which devolves into a rather naive anti-war statement that was unfortunately common during this particular period in American history.<br />No matter, \\"Harold and Maude\\" is great entertainment, and if you're looking for a movie that's a little off the beaten path, try this little gem from Hal Ashby.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000542D2|5.0|The movie is just flat out good.  This is a fine piece of film making.  It is funny, Lester's eye is wonderful and the music is some of the early Beatle's best.  The Beatles themselves are in good form, and even though it has a simple storyline it is still engaging.  Anyone interested in the Beatles, film and 60's culture, this is a must see.  This movie captures what the Beatles in their early years were all about.  When you're done watching this throw in &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot; just for good measure.
B000002HMH|5.0|I love this cd, and as a guitar player, I appriciate the talent that Metallica puts out on this cd.  <BR>   If you think Metallica sold-out, you are not a real fan, muscian, and you know nothing about music.  Just because Metallica was able to change with the times and still keep the heavier sound to thier music is unbelievable.  Not something most 80's bands were able to do, and your dumb, or no nothing of music if you think that the talent, and the riff's arn't there.  Mettalica Rock's, they own rock, and they own some of the best music ever produced, from- Fade to Black, Master of Puppets, One, Forgiven, Bleeding Me, King Nothing, the Memory Remains, and Unforgiven II.  <BR>    Metallica will remain on the top of Rock and Metal forever as these songs will never fade away...oh, Buy this cd, and all metallica cd's and you wont be sad...
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I picked this film up having loved the director's prior film Pi.  I had no idea what the film was about.  I think that was why it had such an impact.  Cinematically, it is brilliant.  The camera angles, the way the film is edited, the movement of the camera in lucid dreaming fashion.  The effects of the filming draws the viewer into the hallucinatory haze of the actors.  Absolutely amazing.<br />As for the story, it is one, long graphic portrayal of the descent into addiction.  Viewer beware: it pulls no punches.  It shows the worst that can happen (especially Jennifer Connelly's character -- horrifyingly brilliant) when your addiction rules your life.  Ellen Burstyn is simply stunning in her role and reveals another facet of drug addiction we often overlook in our chemically laden society.<br />The movie does not preach nor does it present a Pollyanna solution to affects of addiction.  It merely lays out the stories with a gritty realism that left me stunned and disturbed, quite literally, for days.  I can't say this is a bad thing but the movie affected me as few movies ever have.
B000002MX7|5.0|This is a very good collection of Chaka's solo hits. To appreciate her even more, you must get her Rufus/Chaka greatest hits, then Ask Rufus and Rufusized. Her voice is incredible and no one can sing it like Chaka.
B00005RFAI|1.0|This album was horrible.  I wish that I had never bought it for my sister.  When we first put it in to listen in her car we made it through the first two songs and out the window it went.  If you were driving down Highway 101 and accidently got hit with the worst album ever created we're sorry you had to be in it's presence.  She has to be not only the worse performer of all time, but one of the worse &quot;pop&quot; singers of all time.  When it comes to vocal talent I'd give Pink a 3 out of 10.  When it comes to knowledge of music she get's a 0 out of 10.  When it comes to physical beauty, well we can all agree she looks like a man.  When it comes to pop music, she doesn't know what it means.  She needs to learn that she isn't accepted by any facit of the music community.  Her 15 minutes are up!
6305358567|5.0|This film is a masterpiece about a great queen of England, Elisabeth I. She became queen nearly by accident after a brother who tried to eradicate catholicism after Henry VIII in the most austere vision ever thought by anyone, then a sister who tried to eradicate protestantism in blood and fire. She understood that the better interest of the country was to stand on its own legs and to defy any alliance with Spain, France or the Pope. She decided that England was above everything, every personal and particular interest. She got rid of all those who were plotting either on the French side or the Spanish side and she declared herself married once and for all with England itself and no other person at all. She became the Virgin Queen in the blood of the plotters and she managed to make the interest of England the only objective of her reign and of all those who wanted some peace at home and abroad. She built a kingdom and a monarchy that became the strongest in the world and on the oceans, a monarchy that was strong enough to survive the terrible seventeenth century, the Stuarts and the Puritan Revolution. Her self-sacrifice was the cement that made this country what it still is. She is probably the real founder of England as we know it : proud, strong and inspired with a world vision that goes beyond imperialism and contemplates the virtues of freedom, justice and human rights, even if she used some tools and methods that were not always perfectly clean : she only hit at the head of all the plots and prevented any civil war, hence protecting the people and their welfare.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan
B00003CXXP|5.0|A really great fairy tale.  Spielberg can tell a great story.  I was captivated from start to finish.  Don't focus on the techno stuff, it's almost a distraction, just enjoy it like a bed time story.  Wonderful
B00005JKDR|5.0|Even though it is a cartoon, Adults like it too. My 2 1/2 year old loves it so we have seen it several times. The movie contains a lot of things you do not catch at first. Ex. yellow snow it's lemon flavor. It's a fun movie the grand parents also liked it.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I got this soundtrack for Christmas and I love it.  I've been listening to it over and over again.  The only problem I really see is that some songs from the movie were left out.
B000003TAL|4.0|...but it's not my favorite. I was a huge SY fan in high school. When this album came out I bought it right away. And I did like it but I never got the &quot;classic&quot; feel everyone else got. I REALLY loved Sister, I stlll do. I never thought the production on Daydream was very good either. No one ever mentions that so maybe it's just me. <br />I dunno. I still love it but it's just not my favorite album. I saw the tour too. I was pretty bad. They seemed like they were drudging through the entire show. I saw them the next time on the Goo tour and that more than made up for it. I guess all the money from Geffen afforded them some good equipment for taking on tour.
B00005JL3A|4.0|if you are a video games fan you will love this movie end as a mexican fan that i am i say ESTA BIEN CHINGONA
B00005OAIE|4.0|Though many disagree with me, I think this is a great album worth buying. Yeah, he might sound similar to Dave Matthews--but only in the sound of their voices. The styles of music are very different. Obviously, theres no comparing to Dave Matthews. But John Mayer has earned his record deal and this new-found fame.<br />This album may get a bad rap because it kinda falls into the &quot;little girls growing out of britney speaks but still need cheesy pop&quot; catagory. The songs may be upbeat and somewhat pop-sounding, but the heartfelt messeges in the songs are most likely overlooked by this age group. Don't be discouraged by this--Mayer has great talent in his songwriting and his catchy guitar melodies. As a musician myself, I really respect that he writes his own songs and plays guitar.<br />From someone who has looked back at their life and wondered &quot;Am I living it right?&quot; (&quot;Georgia&quot;), sometimes wishes she was still six years old (&quot;83&quot;), wishes she was in love (&quot;Love Song For No One&quot;), and anticipates the better things to come (&quot;no such thing&quot;), this album has struck a chord with me, and I consider it a favorite. Give it a try.

B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the stone age are in this moment the best rock band ... If you like another genre and need a reason to listen rock music....well, then Songs for the deaf is the answer
0446608955|5.0|when i first saw the movie starring Mandy Moore, i couldnt stop crying.  lots of my friends thought the movie was cheesy, but thats one thing the book definately is not.  This book is the movie but 20 times better.  its not at all cheesy, its guaranteed to make you cry.  even if you hated the movie, youll love the book.  anyone who has a heart will have tons of emotion when reading this book.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Lets face it; there can be no denying this man his place atop the music world. He is hands down, far and away the greatest pop culture icon ever. This album is important to show that Elvis 56 was just the beginning. If you listen to the music world of the mid to late 60s, the British Invasion had a hold on the charts and some of the silliest sounding songs came from that time--- poppy little egghead tunes that were annoying. Then you had the Motown sound, which after a decade had lost a lot of its verve and had become formulaic by then. Elvis' sound was fresh. While other 50s rockers were on nostalgia tours then--mainly due to the interest generated by the Comeback Special--- Elvis reinvented himself and dominated the charts again with a vibrant new sound that shaped the next decade of music.<br />No artist crossed over as many different musical categories as Elvis. In fact 5 of his songs simultaneously held the top spot in all three musical categories. He's not only The King of Rock & Roll and Rockabilly, but he is The King of Country Music, The King of Gospel Music, The King of Concerts and The King of Dead Artists.<br />The late 60s Elvis music featured a fully orchestrated production, replete with horns, accompanying a powerful male lead vocal, backed up with soul singers and a choir. Right after the Memphis Record, and Suspicious Minds soared to the top of the charts, the music world changed again and the 70s saw scores of groups adopt this sound-- Ides of March, Rare Earth, Chicago, B.T.O, Hamilton-Joe-Frank & Reynolds, Joe Cocker, to name but a few. The country rock flavor of Elvis' music of this period can be found in music by The Allman Brothers, The Marshall Tucker Band, The Doobie Brothers, Lynrd Skynrd, The Eagles and a host of others.<br />Artists from every genre all over the world hail the King--The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Jim Morrison, even Andrew Dice Clay. So many artists have taken a page from this man's style and sound if even for a song--David Bowie (Young Americans) Queen (Crazy Little Thing Called Love) The Doors (Touch Me)....The Stray Cats and Credence Clearwater Revival's music is a trip back to the Sun Record sound. <br />At the time of his death and directly after the country music craze went mainstream and, had he lived, Elvis' musical career in the 80s would've continued to flourish. I believe that by the 90s the leading ladies of pop would've lined up to do duets with him, and about now, as a senior citizen, he would've scaled back and returned to the skeletal accompaniment of his early days and brought about new trends in the new millennium. <br />Elvis was innovative to the end. His song Moody Blue raced up the charts and was only kept out of the Top 10 by the multitude of releases from the Saturday Night Fever album. The Album went to Number 3 before he died. <br />He is the leading selling artist of the last 25 years and he has been dead for all of them; just think how many more songs would've been on ELV1S #1 HITS had he lived....
B000002LEU|5.0|Substance is the perfect title for this collection of the beautiful darkness that is Joy Division.  Though the songs individually are comprised of a lot of shadow, space and past-midnight hallways, Substance brings them together for an end result that is somehow greater than the sum of the parts.  This is a CD that you can easily leave on auto-repeat for a full day, week, however long it takes to fill you.  Ian Curtis sings his bleak self-fulfilling doom over the perfectly matched more-than-just-punk music, which can take your breath away with its subtle but readily apparent skill.  Peter Hook's strident, foreground bass guitar -- played treble, top string, insistent -- and Stephen Morris's precise eardrum percussion force you, willing or not, to move in sympathy to the beat, lost in the wash of Bernard Albrecht's guitarish stress.  Through the deceptively easy \\"She's Lost Control\\", the almost-pop \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\", the leaden-cloth heaviness of \\"Leaders Of Men\\", Substance leads you down those dark hallways, each one branching off into possibly unexplored regions, letting you take as little or as much as you need from each song.  It's amazing to listen to Substance, and then one of the newer New Order albums, and realize that they are essentially the same band, with one great difference -- the almost sterotypical \\"tortured soul\\" genius of the late Ian Curtis.  It's quickly apparent that the hallways are not really empty, but filled to bursting with Curtis.  If you feel that late-70's punk can be summed up simply by saying \\"The Clash, The Ramones and The Sex Pistols\\", Substance steers you in a new direction.  If you already know the story, then Substance is the perfect addition to your collection.
006092988X|5.0|This book has a way of being able to transport you right to the place and time.  I read it as a sophomore in high school, and have reread it since.  Unbelievable!<br />If you want to read excellent description and authenticity par exelence, just read this book!
B00005UEAR|5.0|Everyone's talked about the 48-minute long song on Disc 2...yes, it's awesome.  A couple brief pros and cons about that.  &quot;Solitary Shell&quot; definitely stands out (to me) and is a deeply moving piece, as are most of 6DOIT.  The one thing I didn't like that was anticipating:  Scenes From a Memory was great to me because of the recurring musical themes; I didn't see this in 6DOIT.  Whereas you would recognize harmonies in SFAM when they came back around, this aspect is not nearly as prelevant in 6DOIT.  Not to say that the effort is a failure, far from it (I mean, recurring themes is a classical technique; progressive bands try new stuff, right?).  However, to me, this recent effort isn't as pleasing (overall) to the ear when one considers it in its entirity.  BUT, it still rocks; it rocks hardcore with a vengence.  Even the very subject matter, individuals conflicted with themselves, often to the point of neurosis, brings to mind such great albums as Dark Side of the Moon (my all-time personal fav which deals with a similar subject, vice and insanity).  Don't miss this album.<br />The first CD, however, was my favorite part of the album.  &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; has since become one of my favorite heavier tunes by DT, right up there with &quot;Home&quot;.  However, &quot;Misunderstood&quot; definitely stands out in my mind as the best work here.  I'm not speaking of difficulty in playing or technical aspects.  This song just rings out loud and proud and I enjoy it.<br />6DOIT started as quite the endevour (sp?), and though it might fall a bit short of it's aims, that doesn't diminish how great it still is.  6 stars, no hesitation.

It really shows her rock side!*****<br />~*~Complicated, #2: I like this song, even though I am a teeny bit tired of it. It is pretty catchy and started Avril off on her career.****<br />~*~Sk8er Boi, #3: This is a cute song, has some kool guitars in it. It is very catchy, and it talks about a preppy chic turning down a guy just because of his looks. I love it!*****<br />~*~I'm With You, #4: THis is a beautiful song!!! It has some lovely orchestra-sounding things and great guitar! A great song! But...It has a couple cuss words in it. Otherwise, an awesome song!!!*****<br />~*~Mobile, #5: I really like this song. Not the absolute best of the album, but still really good! Has good music. ****<br />~*~Unwanted, #6: I like this one too. I love the intro too! Really shows off her rock side too! *****<br />~*~Tomorrow, #7: A pretty song. Nice and peaceful. A break from all the head-bangin punk rock of the previous songs. *****<br />~*~Anything But Ordinary, #8: One of my faves! Talks about...well...being different! Has a catchy melody too! I like! *****<br />~*~Things I'll Never Say, #9: I like! The tune is real catchy and I like the \\"Da-da-da's\\" at the beginning! good song! *****<br />~*~My World, #10: This is a slightly-pop-sounding song that talks about Avril's home, her life...a good song! Has one dirty word though. oh well. I still love the melody! Listen to the lyrics, there funny!*****<br />~*~Nobody's Fool, #11: Rap! I hate rap! But in this case, Avril combines some actual melody and music and makes it an awesome song! I like the \\"Step Up!\\" at the beginning! *****<br />~*~Too Much to Ask, #12: I don't really like this song. I mean it's okay at the beginning but near the end it gets boring. I skip this one most of hte time but sometimes I listen to it. It may grow in me... ***<br />~*~Naked, #13: I love this song! It's a mellow song that completes this great CD! *****<BR>===========================================<br />I LOVE this CD! I reccommend it to everyone! .... But if your like me and actually look beyond her typical teenage attitude, You will LOVE this CD! I promise!<br />Thanks yawl, and happy purchasing! Hope you enjoy and hope my review has helped you with your decision...
B00004U2G4|5.0|This is the real British blues, Zep ripped off these guys. This is back before Rod Stewart got very lame. The guitar is rad and so is everything else.
B00006LFGD|4.0|If only the new Streisand &quot;Duets&quot; cd was as brilliant as its cover.  To be fair- the cd is fine listening.  It presents a career retrospect of duets that Streisand began in the early 60s.  Barbra really began to understand the power and commercial potential of duets after 1978's enormously successful &quot;Flowers&quot; duet with Neil Diamond.  The tracks featuring Kim Carnes and Don Johnson are particularily dated and trivial, but others are just weak songs with weak duet performances (Manilow, and Sinatra to name a few).  Thankfully Mr. Gibb, Mr. Charles, Ms. Garland, Mr. Crawford, Mr. Mathis and others brighten the overall project.  I too would like to see Ms. Streisand duet with others like Linda Ronstadt, Sting, Tony Bennett, or others on a NEW cd- but thanks Barbra for a sampling of the past- now let's look to the future!
B00006690G|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life. It should be put on the list of All Time Greatest Albums!
B000069HKH|4.0|The most popular Springsteen has always been his songs that overwhelm you with reverly, such as Born to Run and Jungleland, where the E Street Band plays to the max, inundating one with guitars and keyboards and saxophone all playing at maximum energy.  But I feel his best songs to me have always been the ones where the tone and tempo of his songs are mellow and haunting, which give you that acky pain in the gut and the chest.<br />I feel that way about his new album.  The title track is a great uplifting song, and songs like 'Countin on a Miracle' and 'Mary's Place' remind one of Springsteen's past classics.  But, to me, it is a song like 'Nothing Man' which captures the pain of the times and the events that are the &quot;inspiration&quot; for this album, while also expertly seizing on the nobility of ordinary people that endure in extraordinary times. That song is painful to hear, yet I cannot stop playing it over and over.<br />And I guess that's the point of this album.  Its different and there may be songs on the album you won't like, but there is a song that will capture you in some way.  While 'Nothing Man' is the song that haunts me, I also really was caught by 'My City of Ruins', 'Paradise' and 'Lonesome Day'.  This is not the Springsteen of decades past, but he can still write powerful songs to consistently capture the tone of this country's heart.<br />Just a couple of other things.  I do not think Springsteen is exploiting 9/11 because a lot of his songs don't directly address the tragedy, nor does he wrap the album around that incident.  Again, 'Nothing Man' is about the nobility of common man without reward through adversity; it could apply to many situations.  The song 'My City of Ruins' was written pre-9/11 about Asbury Park, although the lyrics could easily apply to 9/11 as well.<br />In in all, a fine album.

B00006RU5B|5.0|I bought this album a few weeks ago and I turn it on start listening to it and I heard Chris Cornells voice and I was [upset].  For some reason it reminded me of all that [music] I hate, Ozzy, Aerosmith, and all of those guys with those high pitched voices.  Then I kept listening to it and I said [dang] this cd kicks.  I like soundgarden and Audioslave equals them times like 1000. Great cd glad I bought it.  Go buy it now if you don't your an [americain] that don't know music.
0451167716|5.0|I like many others watched the Godfather (I, II, III) first before picking up Mario Puzo's book. After reading the book, I found myself being more familiar with the characters in the movie and seeing the little things in them that only a novel can describe.<br />With the characters and scenery already painted in my mind this book was just a blast to read! What Puzo did though is describe each character as if that person was breathing right next to you. True master storytellers have the ability to make you taste, touch, and smell moments. A few questions I had were answered in the book and a some minor characters in the movie were given their due in this book.<br />The stories of Lucy Mancini, Johnny Fontane, and Luca Brasi were given with great detail. Some folks I know knock the book for this, but as a fan of the saga...I welcome it!<br />If you watched the movie, you have to check the book out. Usually we find ourselves in the opposite end of the book-movie spectrum, but trust me on this one.
B00005JL78|4.0|The story is profound and absorbing, and Cruise has never been better. I love that it was sci-fi but not too far into the future to believe. There's a good murder mystery in the center and lots of futuristic thrills along the way. What's not to love?
B000059PR5|4.0|For me, this movie was very chilling in light of current world events. The footage of the Nuclear attack was great, but knowing there's a hint of reality to it all is what's chilling about it.
B00006YXE4|5.0|I caught this on a special Freeview and just had to add it to my collection.  It is absolutely the finest live performance I have ever seen period.  The whole band is absolutely smoking hot.  The blues riffs just keep going and going and going.  They nailed \\"Have You Ever Loved A Women?\\"  Simply put, this is one incredible set at an incredible price.
0884271536|4.0|In this book Goldratt is applying the TOC to PM. Here He is introducing a new approach to PM called Critical Chain, applying concepts such as scheduling at 50% of completion time, using early finishes, avoiding student syndrome and Parkinson Law, etc, Goldratt promise that projects using this concepts would finish on time and under budget.<br />I find very innovative the concept of Buffer Management. Here we are taking the slack time from all the project activities and place that time at the end of the project in an activity called &quot;project buffer&quot;. Other great concept is do not Multitask, which in my oppinion is one of the principal project of why projects do not finnish on time.<br />A weakness in this book is: there is not an application of Critical Chain in a multi-project environment.<br />In summary, I've found in this book several interesting concept to improve project performance. Now, there are much better bookS than critical chain, in example Critical Chain Project Management by Leach and Project Management in the Fast Line by Newbold.
B00005JLRR|3.0|I had never been so excited or in such anticipation as I waited for \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" to start.  It had been four years since my favorite crew had graced the big screen and I was [eager] to find out what happened next.  So after all the hype, all the waiting and waiting and WAITING, here's what I thought.<BR>As with every Star Trek film, the special effects were fantastic, the score was powerful, and the acting was good.  Stuart Baird did a fairly decent job directing his first Trek as well.  But we all know there is more to making a good film, and this fourth TNG installment lacks in these other crucial areas.  <BR>First of all, the story (and I won't give away what hasn't been seen in commercials) was weaker than other Trek films.  It seems the sci-fi cinema world has gone clone-crazy.  Gee, if filmmakers had stuck to the \\"every two years\\" schedule of generating Trek movies, they might have beaten \\"Attack of the Clones\\" to theatres instead of having the plot that says, \\"Been there, done that.\\"   <BR>Secondly, there were considerable gaps between action sequences.  And if the dialogue is not interesting enough to maintain audience fixation (and in many places it unfortunately wasn't), the movie will tend to drag.  It started to seem like a very long two hours in some places in the film.  Suspense did start to build around big moments, but it almost always led to nothing too spectacular.<BR>Small pet peeve note:  Why in the 24th century does a \\"new\\" vehicle have wheels?<BR>I did like the character of Shinzon ...but he's no Khan.  However, the more I watched him, the more I believed he would pass for a younger Picard.<BR>But the biggest problem I had with this particular installment was the characterization of Captain Picard.  Throughout these four films we have seen him kind of loosen up in his stringent ways.  But why is he suddenly a rebel space cowboy?  Trek fans respect Picard because he has a sense of order and duty, but now he wants to be part of every away-team mission and live dangerously.  One can't help but make Kirk comparisons, and I really hoped that Picard would always be a foil for the original captain.  Shame.  <BR>Don't get me wrong, I always enjoy Trek movies and this one was no exception.  I just hope it's not the last one.  I don't feel like the TNG crew went out with the bang that they deserve.  I have an idea:  Let's bring the Borg back for one final showdown.  Let's reunite the crew with their favorite annoyance, Q.  And let's fill in all the gaps, answer all the questions, and give each character a respectful send-off.  Name the date, I'll be there.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Oscar-winning Fellowship of the Ring has been and gone. The Two Towers is the film of the moment. It's good. Cinema can't be exactly the same as the books on which they are based. And Peter Jackson gives more to do to characters like Arwen to demonstrate that she has a lot to give up to marry Aragorn and that even the deserving Eowyn cannot compete with her. <br />One criticism in our group was that Faramir's character has been shot to pieces, but perhaps Peter Jackson needed to show Faramir's thought processes and the gravity of the eventual decision he made to let Frodo go. It did the previous portrayal of Boromir no harm either.<br />John Rhys-Davies did a good job as Gimli and as the voice-over for Treebeard. Again it seemed to be necessary to demonstrate the arguments which persuaded such an unhasty character to go up against Saruman.<br />The best actor in the show must surely be the one who played the partly computer-generated Gollum, who portrayed to perfection the two opposing facets to his character - Smeagol & the Gollum he had become. He even got to be heroic in the Dead Marches.<br />But the real star of the series so far is New Zealand, itself. All that lovely scenery really sets off the story, and the co-operation of bit actors, extras etc must have been worth something.<br />I think it will be necessary to see Return of the King to have a true opinion of the entire production. Peter Jackson left the Shelob bit to that last show, and it may have been not to have too many spider movies in one year. (8 legged creatures, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets). I want to see what he actually does next December.
0385508417|5.0|A wacky idea -- skipping Christmas.  Lots of laughing out loud with a few pulls at the heart strings.  John Grisham has written, for us, a modern day &quot;It's A Wonderful Life.&quot;
B00005U122|5.0|Being a long time Floyd fan I was skeptical about this purchase. I immediately jumped to Money and realized that I had a keeper. I then started the DVD from the beginning and finally found the sound I've been missing for a long time. David who? Excellent group of musicians that have a powerful but polished sound. DVD quality is flawless and illustrates the best of 5.1 surround. By far the best 20 bucks I've spent.
1558216847|5.0|A five-star book.  An interesting true story of survival.  A book unashamed to tell the truth about the Soviet evils of the &quot;work camp&quot; and the conquest of Poland.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie had &quot;original&quot; printed on the box and I was a bit skeptical, after all there have been so many good children's offerings in the last few years and coming up with fresh ideas can't be that easy.  I was thoroughly entertained,  the characters were indeed different enough from other movies and the plot was not a rehashed story.  All though there have been plenty of &quot;alien&quot; stories the characters here were original and fresh and the setting of Kauai, Hawaii gave it a  flavor all its own.<br />My sister told me she cried a couple of times watching this.  I am not that easily moved, yet I understand why she felt the emotions she did.  This movie made it's statement by getting the viewer involved in the life of a little girl and not trying to make some some big political statements like many kids movies have.  We weren't asked to feel bad about people going to war, chopping down trees or ruining some native civilization.  We are just shown a little girl in a tough setting and how she deals with life.<br /> When she meets the other star of the film, Stitch, the fun begins and the two get into lots of trouble.  The story is basic enough that it is still fun and entertaining for the young, yet has enough going for it that it will be enjoyed by adults as well.<br />In my house the 20 month old rules the DVD player and a movie that is good by her standards get played over and over.  I won't mind multiple viewings of this movie, hey I've seen Monsters Inc about forty times, and I highly recommend this one as a purchase; This movie belongs in the family DVD collection.
0066214122|5.0|If you value sleep, please pass up on this one. Not because it's scary (although, when you think about it, it's downright terrifying), but because you won't be able to stand it, wondering what will happen next. I imagine you might know this book will be made into a movie, and some of the scenes might be written with that in mind, scenes that beg for awesome special effects.<br />Crichton does so much research, you have to wonder, \\"what if...?\\" The theme of technology overtaking society has been around seemingly forever; however, with the news of a baby clone being born today, you have to wonder...how long before the scientists lose control? And how many would it take to ruin things for everyone? Well, just a small handful....read this book!!...
B00005JKZT|5.0|In this second movie, Peter Jackson makes far grander changes than he did in the first film.  Some dialog and plot has been simplified as it probably was needed to be, but there are also entire subplots that threaten to take our beloved characters in brand new directions.  These changaes seem to add as many problems as they add great moments.  However, Peter Jackson respects the source material and gently returns us to familiar territory in the end.  I actually enjoyed the overall philosophy, as it made this film a mostly new experience for me, instead of always knowing what to expact next. <br />Gollum is easily the best \\"new\\" part of this trilogy, as the most life-like CGI creation I've ever seen.  Rumors of a first-ever Oscar nomination for a CGI actor are well deserved, as Gollum forfills his place as the great mystery of this story, a character that completely captivates and mystifies.    <br />Another high point is the huge final battle sequence at Helm's Deep.  I didn't think this was a great a some would tell you - it is basically an extension of the opening battle scenes in the first movie, with lots of orcs clashing from different directions of the screen.  I was much more impressed with the Clone Wars finale.<br />Of course, the Two Towers shares the same problems of the first movie, and in fact these weaknesses are intensified.  The pacing is still insanely fast and chaotic, cutting between 3, sometime 4 or 5 subplots!  The director sometimes overpowers his actors' fine performances with melodramtic shots and music.     <br />Already, I am longing for the extended DVD version of this movie.  If it adds as much material as the Fellowship of the Ring, then I'm sure any problems I have with this movie will be solved.
B00003CXV4|1.0|This is one of the worst movies that I've ever had to watch.  It was utterly boring, and I'd say that there was not a single redeeming quality.  Not a single scene that I even kinda enjoyed, and Charlize Theron didn't even have her A-game in this flick.  Sickly, dying Charlize is not as fun as lively, vibrant, sexy Charlize.  Keanu was as bland and lifeless as ever, and not even in a good way.  Not a single moment in this movie was worth capturing on film.  Not entirely the fault of the actors or director, because the material (writing) was awful as well.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|This album was long awaited and did not dissapoint me. The first single (All the things she said)is strong and well put together. It lodges itself into your head and you find yourself humming the tune many a time!<BR>At times the other songs reminded me of the high pitch voice of Vanessa Paradis, but the lyrics and the way they portrait the song are beyond that comparison, it is a lot more to the core. The Russian lyrics do give that sence of exotic and 'newwie' feel to the album.  The cover of the 'charmed' theme song (How Soon Is Now) is a good choice although the performance could have been more powerful and deeper. <BR>The first song should not have been there or should have been better written. Lyrics are not good and it doesn't fit the music. Apart from that this album is well worth buying.<BR>Best Song: All The Things She Said <BR>Worst Song: Not Gonna Get Us
0451191153|5.0|I just finished this book yesterday, but I didn't want it to end.<br />I've also read _Atlas Shrugged_ and was amazed by Miss Rand's ability to spin a tale.  The characters are ficticious, but you feel as if they live next door.  You laugh with them, cry with them, get angry when they make silly decisions.<br />Say what you want about Miss Rand's Objectivist theories, this story provokes the reader to think about questions that go relatively unasked in this society.  Why do we feel the need to hold others back to make ourselves look better?  Why do we have empty feelings of accomplishment?  Why aren't we happy?<br />To push yourself emotionally, intellectually, to understand the drive of mankind, one should read this book.  If you just want a great story, READ THIS BOOK!

B000002I4S|5.0|John Coltrane spent years restlessly searching to perfect his craft (the strain of which eventually led to his untimely death), which is ironic as well as extra-tragic, considering his artistry was already perfectly presented here on _Giant Steps_, Trane's breakout recording as a leader. Although a huge jazz aficionado, I'm not particularly a huge Coltrane fan (only own three of his albums at the moment), but I would definitely rank _Giant Steps_ as one of the most enjoyable out of my collection.<br />As opposed to many of his later, more \\"arty\\" efforts, which largely reflect a sense of agonized striving, _Giant Steps_ overflows with nothing so much as exuberance and *fun*. Great tunes, great foot-tapping swing (Art Taylor: wonderful jazz drumming), great album. The only thing perhaps out of place is Tommy Flanagan on piano-he barely keeps up (particularly noticeably on the title tune). Where had McCoy Tyner been all Coltrane's life? The piano's not recorded too well, either-sounds kinda muffled. Wynton Kelly *nails* the piano solo on \\"Naima\\", though; definitely one of the finer moments on this top-flight album. Maybe he should have played on the rest of the tunes, too.<br />Very interesting are the alternate takes tacked onto the CD after the album proper, some of which are with different musicians from the ones on the original release, including a somewhat slower \\"Giant Steps\\" and extended-drum-solo version of \\"Countdown\\".
B000002KET|4.0|OK so Ozzy's vocals make Johnny lydon sound like Pavorotti but there are just Killer songs and riffs on this album. 'Sabbra Cadabra' is a song straight outta hell if ever I heard one and 'Looking for Today' is an excellent blend of the Band's big riffs and hellish lyrics. This is Sabbath's true masterpiece every song on the album is very strong.It makes other wannabe bands of Destruction and misery seem very miserable.
B000069AUI|5.0|I've followed Coldplay since their early days as brit-rock &quot;nobodys&quot;, and this new album is a welcome evolution in their sound, not a jarring departure.  Purchase this CD and be prepared to wear it out on  your CD player.
0780631684|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good. Final Destination stands apart from the Screams, I Know What You Did Last Summers and Urban Legends. It's not really a teen horror movie either, I'd consider this to be a little bit of everything, Suspense, Thriller, Mystery and for lack of a better name, semi Horror.<br />On their senior class trip to France, Alex (Davon Sawa) falls aa;eep on the plane before take off and has a terrible nightmare that the plane was going to explpde. When he wakes from his nightmare, he does something that he also did in his dream and in a hysteric fit, proclaims that the plane was going to explode. This stunt gets him kicked off the plane, along with a few of his friends and his teacher. After the plan they were supposed to take takes off, it explodes. After this, the kids find out that they were more than lucky because something else had a plan for them.<br />This movie will freak you out. Plus it's also a nice step away from all those other Teen Slashers that I'm sure most of us were getting sick of. This is a very respectable movie in it's own and each scene where someone is killed, it's very unique and not, oh someone gets stabbed. <br />This is a very cool movie to own. If there was one movie out of the whole Teen Horror movie era, FINAL DESTINATION should be that one movie. Really, check out this movie. You won't be disappointed. This is a total non stop thrill ride from beginning to end.
6303965415|1.0|I love Jane Austen... read her books over and over.  Appreciate almost every attempt to portray her genius on film.  But this dark, wimpy, portrayal is an insult.  The perfect Anne Elliott of the novel smiles only twice in this entire film, the rest of the time walks around with a 'deer-in-the-headlights'-with- depression look- this is not the admired, strong, smart, persevering Anne it should have been... the novel makes you want to copy Anne- this film makes you want to run!  Yuk! The old BBC version is so much closer to the real story, and the characters perfect.  This version is not worth borrowing for free from a friend!
630521610X|3.0|This movie/franchise started the entire Teen Slasher/Horror movie craze and it was O.k. Let's be real for starters, all slasher movies in general either have no plot or very little plot and SCREAM is no exception to that rule. <br />Exactly 1 year ago, from the start of the movie, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) helps put the killer of her mother behind bars. Now a year after the conviction, 2 teens are brutally killed in similar fashion to her mother. Now the question is, who's behind it? Is it the killer that killed her mom and that they have the wrong guy behind bars or is it someone else? <br />I'm giving this a 3 because this was a basic hack and slash movie and the mystery surrounding the killer wasn't done well because the investigation for the killer was left a little flat. Plus by the last 45 minutes of the movie, you pretty much had it figured out. <br />Another thing that bothered me about this movie was that it was way too cliche' even for a Teen slasher. Why is it that when the killer is trying to kill a busty, female victim, she runs for her life and puts up the biggest fight whereas when the killer stalks a male victim, the guys go down in a heartbeat? The contrast just isn't there and there's really no gray area. <br />It's still decent enough to sit back and watch but I personally wouldn't go into this one with too many expectations because this is a pretty basic one. Nothing's too complicated in this one and each victim's demise is pretty basic as well (with the exception of 1). Rent this one first, see what you like and if you like it, by all means, check out the rest of the series.
1402516274|5.0|I have listened to about twenty classic novels in the form of unabridged audio recordings, and the Lord Of The Rings was by far the best. In fact, it was altogether different.<br />That Tolkien is a master of the written word is beyond question, and you will find few other books that will delight you like this one, or educate you half so well. But, it is Inglis that makes this work so remarkable.<br />You will wonder that there is not a whole cast of actors given the diversity of the voices, or that the book has not been dramatised given the performance. You will fall love in love with the adorable Treebeard, be inspired by the wisdom of Gandalf, and shed a tear at the simple goodness of everyday hobbit folk.<br />The term 'Shakesperian actor' is bandied around a little too often; it's true worth is not alway acknowledged. But Inglis' performance demands applause. In conjunction with the equal mastery of Tolkien, and the value of the sum is necesarilly greater than the value of the parts.<br />The Lord Of The Rings audio production is more than a work of art, it is a place to spend your time, a solace from the tedium of everyday life, and a shared understanding between you and the characters of Middle Earth.<br />I urge you to buy this book, or some other great work. If you are not touched by it then you have no heart, and if your integrity and fortitude are not strengethened by it then you have no soul. If you can't afford it to own it then gain access to it some other way - it's your birthright.
076790382X|5.0|Bill Bryson has done it again... While this is not his most recent work, it is the one I've most recently read. Accessible, poignant, FUNNY, sharp-witted, compassionate, thought-provoking and above all, interesting, &quot;Stranger&quot; is one of those rare books that can be picked up and started from just about any page. The format of the work, a series of weekly newspaper columns in a London, England paper, lends itself well to Bryson's trademark blend of satire, political opinion and downright fantastic storytelling. I would be hard pressed to mention another author who could make a story about the misfortunes of getting stuck in an attic access hatch so interesting. Bryson also manages to convey a very good sense of living in a classic New England small town, regardless of his twenty year absence from the USA. His powers of observation (most pointedly those observations taken in front of a mirror...) are refreshing and often hilarious.<br />Anyone who can spin hyperbole into downright funny satire like Bryson does in his observation of &quot;tax-time&quot; deserves a medal or something of the sort. Perhaps he should get a tax break for finally making sense of the whole business... Read the story and you'll see why that might just be reasonable.<br />Bryon's literary humor seems to complement George Carlin's stand-up humor quite nicely. I'd love to see both of them do an act together. Now THERE'S an idea...

B0000028VT|4.0|&quot;Music Box&quot;, Mariah Carey's third long play album (1993), remains her most accessible work for general public. It is ballad-heavy, making the singer one of top balladeers of 1990's and sending her songs among the most requested in various shows (I suppose especially those where you could send a song to your darling).<br />In fact, &quot;Music Box&quot; is so free of anything controversial that it looks suspicious, especially now that we know real Mariah is different and that she said she had felt in her marriage with Sony Music boss Tommy Mottola like a bird trapped in a golden cage. She never sounded so incurably romantic, never anymore was such a conventional woman as here.<br />Indeed, nearly all the songs are about Mariah being deeply in love, Mariah dreaming of true love, Mariah crying over lost love or saying goodbye to a-still-beloved person. Besides, there is her famous tune &quot;Hero&quot; and friendship anthem &quot;Anytime You Need a Friend&quot;.<br />The collection is by far the most melody-driven Carey has ever put out. &quot;Music Box&quot; is a true gem, a beautiful song. &quot;Without You&quot; was a cover that made her famous throughout the planet, especially in Europe (where her appeal was low before 1994). In &quot;Never Forget You&quot; collaboration with Babyface (at the time at the height of his fame) and &quot;Just to Hold You Once Again&quot; Carey perfectly displays tenderness and fragility.<br />Two cuts prepared by Clivilles &amp; Cole duo (the last two ever, as David Cole later succumbed to AIDS) do not sound as fresh as they did back then, but hold up rather well, chiefly due to Mariah's dynamic voice.<br />&quot;Music Box&quot; remains among Carey's most commercials albums. At the time of its release, Mariah had such a strong position on the charts that blockbusting success was sure -- although it came on the heels of such huge female smashes as Whitney Houston's &quot;Bodyguard&quot; and Janet Jackson's &quot;janet.&quot; Over Christmas in 1993, both the single &quot;Hero&quot; and the album dominated the US sales.
B000066NW0|5.0|I've read other reviews, I've seen the ratings.  I can say that anyone who put less than 3 stars to this album must have missed something...  or the whole thing!  A movie with this CD as the main soundtrack would be helped a lot...  (It's better than the soundtrack of Josie and The Pussycats...)  I don't see any problem with Avril Lavigne vocal talent on this CD; she sounds great, indeed.  I don't know if she sounds great because of the work they did in the studio.  And I guess that this is irrelevant.  All the songs are beautifully crafted, musically speaking.  They are all pleasant to listen to and not too easy, common...  Now, for the etiquette...  Is that punk rock?  Perhaps not...  I think it's pop-rock and definitively AMONG the BEST pop-rock albums you will EVER be able to find.  The lyrics are all from Avril Lavigne and I find that amazing for a debut album.  Don't expect to hear the same thing if you attend her show.  You can't do \\"voice superposition\\" in a show or in a live performance.  (As in the chorus of Complicated, for example).  (Even Alanis Morissette did this on her albums...  and probably that Alanis inspired Avril in some ways!)  This is definitely one of my All-time-Top-10 CD.  If you like energized-rock, entertaining beats, authentical, go buy this album!!  It's a delight!  (I think it's going to be hard to do a second album as good as this one!!)
B00004VVNB|5.0|A great DVD!  The commentary track and bonus featurette are a fantastic addition to this great sci-fi classic.  Unfortunately, none of the footage tossed by MGM is available, so we will never see the 3 minute love shop scene!  This is my personal favorite of classic 70's science fiction, buy it now!!
B000002AOD|5.0|One More Once is quite possibly the easiest recommendation in my entire jazz collection, and that's saying something.  Every track is laced with passion and expression, and beauty.  &quot;Why Not?&quot; is in-your-face Latin Jazz at its finest, with a freakishly tight horn section that blows my hair back every time I hear it.  &quot;Suite Sandrine&quot; and &quot;Dreamlight&quot; are a welcome reprieve from the intensity of previous tracks, and offer captivating grooves that make the 8+ minutes per song more than welcome.  The second half of the album is a return to upbeat material that's crisp and engaging, with memorable themes throughout.  Michel Camilo shows his brilliance as a musician, composer, and arranger on every track -- this CD is quite possibly his finest work.  A must-have for any jazz lover.
B000066F6H|3.0|I agree that the hives have potential to become a fabulous band.  They just need to figure out how to be talented.  This disc displays the complete idiocy of their songwriting.  The guitars are stripped from what could be the next legendary hook.  This is nothing but cheap three cheap, three chord rythms you'd expect a rookie to write.  They also had the nerve to do multiple overdubs on the guitars, reminiscent (and trying to be like) the Sex Pistols: Nevermind the Bullocks album.  If you want to hear brilliance (with only a single overdub) buy the Damned: Damned Damned Damned.  The drummer's ok though.<br />The hives trash talk on the Ramones for having guitar solos.  If the hives had anything close to the brilliance of Joey, Dee Dee, Tommy, and Johnny they could be great.  Instead, they call themselves a great band and expect you to believe it.  You can call yourself great all you want, that doesn't make it true.<br />The collection on this record is terrible. It's honestly nothing but cheap hooks and poor stabs at social commentary. Take the line on the opening track: \\"5 - 7 - 9 - 11\\" if that's unclear, examine it again.<BR>Anyway, Hate to Say I Told YOu So, Main Offender, Die All Right, and Supply and Demand are in between terrible and sorta good, but not worth the money...download them<br />Euro-punk/grunge bands are fashionable at the moment.  The Hives: cheap, untalented, self-proclaimed wizards need help becoming one of the great bands.  If you want to be fashionable, while hearing great music, buy Division of Laura Lee: Black City instead of any Hives album.  DOLL is a Swede group too.  The difference??? DOLL is a great band, the Hives aren't
B00005JKZT|1.0|I didn't see the first movie but I went to this one.  Ugh.  I'm not really a battle fan.  Also, I've decided I prefer movies where you can look at the characters and not want to shield your eyes.  Come on, do they really have to make squelching noises when a creature changes facial expressions?  A good part of that movie could have been cut out. By the end of my movie I was fidgeting around in my seat because my back hurt due to the length.  Their are pretty much no women in this, and the ones that are in the movie are undeveloped characters. If you do decide to go to this movie (although I really reccomend not seeing it or seeing the movie at home so you can fast-forward through parts of it) you should have seen the first one so you won't be as confused as I was.  Another good idea would be to bring a flashlight and a good book if you get bored, unless you can fall asleep upon whim.

B00005JL78|5.0|When i first saw this movie I was hoping it would put me to sleep because it was 11 o'clock at night and the begining was normal enough for speilberg movie (set in the future lots of cool looking toys) so i figuered not another AI (Artificial Intelligence) which was horrible by the way.  but was i wrong in the begining minutes we learned about the pre congs who saw future murders and other serious crimes.  And  from there their was so many twists and turns I had to watch  it again to fully understand the movie.  But if you see one movie this month see The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers but if you watch two see Minority Report.  Who am I kidding I mean honestly who watches only one movie a month.  So watch both.
B000002LOE|1.0|When I heard the brilliant &quot;loosing my religion&quot; single in 91' I was instantly hooked on REM. Commercial success followed. Unfortunately apart from that , this disc offers the biggest load of mediocre garbage that I've heard in ages. It was really hard not ejecting the disc. I haven't heard many REM albums but I'll make a guess and say that this is the worst.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Men in Black II is a good family movie but is lacking the newness and the independence of the first movie.  It's shorter than the first movie but is jam packed with special features that honestly i'll never watch.  But this movie is okay overall with a better song (in my opinion) by Will Smith called Back in Black.  But on any means do not see this movie before watching the original because most of the jokes are refrences to the original.
B000068MFS|3.0|This is a romantic comedy, but the comedy does not stick with you.  It is not that the movie is unfunny, but the laughs won't be remembered tomorrow; none of the humor is that memorable.  Two people meet by chance and have a wonderful time together.  Since they are seeing other people, they go their own ways and decide to leave their meeting again to the fates.  Watching their separate paths inadvertently cross without their knowing is the main part of the movie.  Pure serendipity!<br />John Cusack is John Cusack.  His character is similar to most of the good guy/dreamer-type characters he plays in many movies.  John Corbett is funny as the boyfriend of Kate Beckinsale.  <br />I would recommend this if you are looking for a light-hearted romance, but not if you are looking for a comedy.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have always had inclinations to deeply respect Japan; I feel it is one of the most capable artistic centers in the world, akin to '70s USA. Everything about it rings of a combination of art and technology. Much more interesting, though, is how this ties in with common Japanese themes. Just as Final Fantasy VII was a video game, it focused thematically on respect for nature. In the same vein, Miyazaki's Spirited Away (another phenomenal movie) manages to do this through an animated medium.<br />This theme occurs again and again in Japanese cinema in notable works such as Akira and Neon Genesis Evangelion. It, quite honestly, never gets old. This is what makes Spirited Away special. While it addresses modern life, it does not focus on the impersonal nature of technology. Spirited Away's focus is entirely its own. Spurred by the depressed indifference Miyazaki found in \\"10 year-old girls\\" he knew, he created a portrait of a young girl, Chihiro, overcoming obstacles. It's a simple story, designed only to encourage Japan's newest generation. But, what makes it great is the art with which this is accomplished. I call this movie a portrait because it lacks a Western-style plot. It has no distinctive beginning and no end. What causes Chihiro's disillusionment is unknown, and her story does not necessarily end upon leaving the abandoned amusement park where the story takes place. This reflects the Japanese belief that nothing really ends, and serves as a problem for those unaccustomed to this viewpoint. Likewise, there are some complaints about the story from other reviewers that I urge you to dismiss based upon some simple explanations about the movie.<br />First, many note the anti-Western themes. Really, Miyazaki avoids these. Rather than casting blame on others, he avoids classifying Chihiro's original condition as having any cause. This isn't whiny, it's art. Rather than giving in to the audience's primal inclinations to insist that an adverse condition in the individual (Chihiro) is caused by the negative input of society, Miyazaki instead focuses on Chihiro's triumph. In short, this is more of an uplifting movie than some sociocultural blame game. If you want proof of how controlled Japanese animation can be regarding anti-Western sentiment, watch Grave of the Fireflies (from Studio Ghibli). It's hard to find, but it's easily the best war movie I've ever seen (and it features no battle scenes, another amazing instance of artistic control).<br />Also, some reviews noted Chihiro's \\"absence of greed\\" juxtaposed against her parent's gluttony as indicative of traditional Japanese virtues. This is not so. She does not eat lustily with her parents because she thinks she will get in trouble. Note that she is entirely self-absorbed until her parents are taken captive. Only when she can no longer be disinterested and negative about modern life does she truly change. Yet, the obstacles of life do not change at all. The spirit world remains the same, although it appears in a much more friendly way towards the movie's end. The demeanor of the characters in the movie are all determined by Chihiro's outlook. Even the cold-hearted witch is shown to be a loving grandmother. And despite being easily enraged, she cares dearly for her oversized baby boy.<br />A note on the ratings. The movie is rated PG because it deserves to be rated as such. Here is the first sentence describing the PG rating, straight from [...]<br />\\"This is a film which clearly needs to be examined or inquired into by parents before they let their children attend.\\"<br />And people cannot believe it's only rated PG? PG stands for Parental Guidance Suggested. You can be sure that the movie contains some objectionable content, and if your kids don't like \\"scary\\" movies, then exercise some parental guidance. Don't go blaming the filmmakers or the MPAA when they are right, but you refuse to follow their recommendations.
B00000JZIK|5.0|A great movie with a great cast of characters and actors.  I mention both because the script provides us with a great story concerning a collection of rogues, and the actors truly make these rogues memorable.  This film takes a crime drama and adds a twist.<br />As the story unfolds, the viewers, as well as the interrogating police, find themselves getting more and more enmeshed in the tale.<br />The work of Kevin Spacey in this movie is stellar.  He shares a very wide acting range with the audience.  Seeing his performance alone is worth the time to see the movie.<br />I would highly recommend seeing this movie.
B000002R48|4.0|This is a pretty good album if you can get past (and you will)the terrible production and dominici's voice. YTSE Jam is a masterpiece, and Fortune in Lies is amazing. This is a must buy for every big Dream Theater fan out there...and yes, you can really hear a little bit of a Rush influence, but hey, it's progressive rock we're talking about here, what else can you expect...buy it!!!
B000006OS2|2.0|The movie is one of my favorites the Duke ever made. I was really excited to see it on DVD. I can't describe my disappointment and frustration as I watched it over Christmas. The recording of the movie was made from a very poor film copy. Many scenes are blurry - totally out of focus. Film scratches are continuous. Don't buy this - wait for someone else to re-master it so it's watchable!
B00005YW4H|5.0|When I first heard Norah Jones, I thought that the music was a lot older, perhaps Billie Holiday or someone similar from a different era.  This is a very mature effort for only a first release, and for someone only 22 years old - amazing!  In a time of talentless, overproduced garbage like Britney, Christina and the lot, Norah Jones is a soothing breath of fresh air.  This is simply the best female vocal album I have heard in years.
B00005TT77|5.0|After seeing this movie, I decided I needed the soundtrack.  Not because I was in love with each and every song on it but because I never wanted to forget the movie.  These songs bring back a memory of each scene they were played with.  Get the soundtrack because you love the movie and you want to remember it (and its message) always.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Not hardly. \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" is, in my opinion, the best \\"Trek\\" film since \\"Star Trek IV.\\" Now, I was never a fan of the 'Next Generation' series, however I have always been a fan of teh \\"Star Trek\\" movies...why? Who knows, probably my undying love for science fiction. Anyhoo, I thought that this film attempted to recapture the energy of those first set of films that featured Kirk & Spock. In fact, one could almost draw some, although thin, comparisons to \\"Trek II & III.\\" I wasn't expecting much from this film going into it, as the critics had harpooned it and called the franchise 'dead.' I tend to disagree. I think that this film was quite different from any \\"Trek\\" film in years, mainly due to the fact that there was a new director on board - Stuart Baird. The movie packs quite a bit of action, some fantastic space battles, clever dialogue and an emotional gut-punch of an ending. Admittedly, the plot was very complex and at points hard to follow, however if you know anything about \\"Star Trek,\\" you know that you are in for a great thrill ride of a movie. Great sound, a really good looking new ship - the Enterprise-E, and a trailer before the film for the best show on TV - \\"Enterprise.\\" I hope that the \\"ST:TNG\\" crew comes back for one final journey, and then pass the torch on to Captain Archer and his crew. The franchise is not dead, and I can not think of any reason that a \\"Star Trek\\" fan should be upset or disappointed by this film. However, if you don't like \\"Star Trek,\\" or if you are unfamiliar with the genre, don't expect to see the greatest film ever made. Just enjoy it for what it is...an entertaining sci-fi flick.
0060194995|5.0|No wonder this story is so compelling. It's about the neighborhood where Harper Lee and Truman Capote hailed from.<br />This is a rare instance where the novel was so phenomenal that the moviemakers in Hollywood dared not disturb the content. The casting was perfect too.<br />What is amazing is that after all these years of legislation and social reform, the story still touches the core of human prejudice that resides in us all and the story seems timeless.<br />If you know someone who has yet to read this book, see to it that they do; it's that significant.
B000069HK2|5.0|I wasn't really expecting to like this album, but I ended up loving it. I thought they were more a nu-metal band since they were on Ozzfest. Their really closer to bands like Finch and Taking Back Sunday, and especially Thursday. I really didn't think a modern band on a major label could put out something so awesome, but I was wrong. I love it. Thank you for your time.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash is a legend.  Unlike many other musicians who have had long and legendary careers, some of his best music also happens to be his most recent. Teaming up with producer Rick Rubin, Cash has managed to defy genres and generations with his mix of standards, contemporary covers and originals that make up the American Recordings Series.  His latest album is no exception.  When the Man Comes Around features some of Cash's finest (the title track is an instant Cash classic) and weirdest moments - sometimes at the very same time (sincere and damn good covers of Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\"  and Nine Inch Nail's \\"Hurt,\\" anyone?).  While some songs work better than others (Fiona Apple's duet with Cash on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is growing on me), the album as a whole is a picture of a legend who isn't slowing down.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|I would suggest any one who wishes to invest in this cycle to buy the Rheingold DVD and sample the other operas before making a decision for I found the performances of the other 3 operas in the cycle to be far from idea.<br />Levine's often slow tempo creates quite a lot of problems for the singers. He is at his best in Rheingold but his conducting becomes more and more drawn out in the subsequent operas. As seen on DVD, Norman isn't a convincing Sieglinde and Lakes's Siegmund disappoints. The Gunther and Gutrune are also not well casted, as is the Alberich. Ludwig, late in her career at the time of this production, disappoints as Fricka. Behrens is simply over-parted as Brunnhilde. Morris is an adequate Wotan and Jerusalem a pleasing Siegfried. <br />The production is good but ordinarily directed. The final crumbling of Valhalla is disappointingly done. The videography, however, is good.
B00006C79E|4.0|It seems that the 80's electro-funk sound is back (examples include Ladytron, Madonna's new \\"Die Another Day\\" single, Chicks On Speed...) and I can safely say...  \\"Why?  What did we ever do to you?\\"  Despite my less than enthusiastic embrace of this 80's trend, I can attest that if anybody was going to take on the task of using this trend for the betterment of electro-pop, than it would be Saint Etienne.  Finisterre contains electro-funk done right among other pop gems.  You may remember them from their semi-hit cover of Neil Young's \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" back in 1992.  Since then, this band has put out some of the best and catchiest pop records of the decade.  Although they get much attention is the U.K., their fan base in the U.S. is devout, but pretty tiny.  Their newest release shows them keeping up the pace with, and at times surpassing some of their best work.  \\"Amateur\\"  is a better song and Sarah Cracknell's vocals more compelling than Madonna's on \\"Die Another Day,\\" yet you certainly won't be hearing this one 10 times an hour on top 40 radio.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love everysingle song on that cd my number one song is beautiful. I listen to this cd about two times a day or more.<BR>This is sooooooo good. Buy it its worth it!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I first heard this record while sitting in the Majestic Caf enjoying a nice meal with friends before we left for the opera. I was so compelled by it, that I had to ask the waitress, \\"Who is this woman singing?\\" I made a mental note and went right out and bought the album. Since then Jones has found critical acclaim and much press coverage, particularly in Rolling Stone which featured her in their \\"Women In Rock\\" issue along such contemporaries (and I use that word very hesitantly) as Brittany Spears, Avril Lavinge and Alanis Morissette. One thing puts Jones way ahead of the competition however: she's undeniably talented. Who cares if she's beautiful? Who cares if she is Ravi Shankar's daughter? One listen to her voice and nothing else about her seems very important. From touches of country to laid back jazz, Jones floats through genres and defies categorization. A wonderful debut.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love everysingle song on that cd my number one song is beautiful. I listen to this cd about two times a day or more.<BR>This is sooooooo good. Buy it its worth it!
B00006IUL7|4.0|...with Christopher Nolan at the helm, and all these Oscar winners roaming around amazing outdoor vistas, involved in a twisty murder mystery. It just couldn't suck.<BR>...It's a very well-done thriller, with some stuff you've seen a million times (but you don't care because it's THAT well-done) and some stuff that will have even the most jaded viewers perking up their collective eyebrows in surprise.<BR>It's way too early to tell if this is one of the five best films of the year, but it's excellent filmmaking all the way around, and well worth a perusal.
0151008116|4.0|A great book for a teenager but reading it as an adult was disappointing. Reminds me of a book that my 4th grade teacher read to my class after lunch. I loved that story.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Really. It's a great film. Mind you, it was only meant for me. I'm a comics fan from WAY back...I've read every issue of every title of our favorite wall-crawler. I've grown up with him. He's grown up with me. So it means something when a movie comes out that people like myself have literally waited their WHOLE lives for, and not be at all disappointed.<BR>To the contrary, in the theater, I grinned from the opening credits to the last flickering frame. The next day (had to go back, you know), same thing. I just saw it again on Christmas Eve, and again, pure bliss.<BR>It's smart. It's fun. It looks good. It sounds good. It IS good. The characters are terrific, the effects nifty and the drama multilayered and involving at all times. The DVD extras are just gravy. <BR>Honestly, I couldn't ask for more...except for a sequel...
B000060P79|1.0|And people STILL buy into it. And they make it obvious too. One look at their new video shows that all they're trying to do is make wimpy sensitive lyrics to make girls love them with catchy poppy tunes. And once again, why is this still being classified as punk?? It isn't. I call it pop with distorted guitars at best. This is another one we can let the TRL posers who think they're punk to pick up.
B00004T9UF|5.0|A towering achievement. The triad of entities being Marshall Mathers, Eminem and Slim Shady meld as never before, with incendiary raps, literally breathtaking production values, and real storylines that'll hook you instantly. Take songs like \\"Kill You\\", \\"The Way I Am\\", \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" and the masterpiece \\"Stan\\"...those alone would form the nucleus of a classic rock album. The latter song uses pencil scratching along with the Dido clip, and a true acting performance from Eminem (if you know this song, it won't surprise you he can act...) to just grab you by the throat and wake you the ... up. <BR>Where does Marshall end and Eminem begin? How much of Eminem is the real Slim Shady? Is he just messing with our heads, and laughing at all of us? I find this fascinating...
B000075BFK|5.0|When I first heard this album i felt like the rest... another Pac ablum with previously released tracks...only remixed with Suge Knight's name written all over it. The ablum did not interest me at all. But once you sit down and listen...and remember that these are Pac's Lyrics. And no producer can take that away from him. Songs like \\"My Block\\", \\"Better Days\\", and \\"Thugz Mansion\\" show Pac's better side. Other songs like \\"When We Ride On Our Enemies\\", and \\"F**k Em\\" still have the hate that dreaded Pac until his death. Sure Pac would never have Nas in his ablum if he were alive today...but thats the kind of hate that got him no where. And Nas being able to remix such a track (Thugz Mansion - Acoustic) that grabs Pac lyrics and places them under a peaceful guitar - from a former enemy nonetheless - and adding his own verse. Almost as if to claim peace between them...
B00006690G|5.0|Two in a row now, of making albums by rapping like no else, with premiere production values...and absolutely inflammatory lyrics, which never sound false. That's the strange thing. For the last two albums, it's as if any filter has been turned off, and whatever synapses happen to link up under his skullcap, those thoughts come raging out to a symphony of rock and hip-hop.<BR>This time around, he's stepped up with some maddeningly catchy melodies, such that they are. The chorus of \\"Without Me\\" should come with an antiviral, 'cause once you've heard it, you're stuck with it. I couldn't get that sucker out of my head for weeks.<BR>Also, the triumvirate of Mathers/Eminem/Shady blurs even further, like one person's superego, ego and id. Now that I mention it, if I find out he took a psychology course and planned this all along...folks, we clearly don't realize what we're dealing with. Look at \\"8 Mile.\\"<BR>You must admit, even if you are not interested in rap at all, this is a career to watch.<BR>I can't wait to see what he does next...
B00005JLRR|5.0|The crew from Next Generation have scored a direct hit with this film. The adventure was good and the crew seem like they been together forever. It was fun to watch the the ineraction between the characters. Lots of fun, do not miss.
B000002IU9|4.0|I have to admit that the thing that got me interested in Manowar was the unique look of their logo, since besides music, my first love has always been multimedia and design. The logo looked so cool that I thought I'd do a little research into the music itself. Being a child of the '80s, I have a sort of \\"G.I. Joe/Rambo\\" macho thing going, always have. I heard clips of \\"Metal Warriors\\" and \\"Ride The Dragon,\\" my first tastes of Manowar, and I was instantly hooked! Needless to say, I ended up buying the CD. This is true, POWERFUL metal, nothing more, nothing less. From the opening, almost operatic chords of \\"Achilles: Agony and Ectasy in 8 Parts\\" to the slow, emotional ballad that is \\"Master of the Wind,\\" there is hardly ever a place where this CD lets you down. I have to say that the night after the events of 9/11/01, I cranked up the speakers in my car to \\"Burning,\\" and I felt like everything was going to be all right, \\"THE STRONG WILL SURVIVE!\\" VERY good CD; it has made me a lifelong fan of the Kings of Metal!
B00005R2IS|5.0|I wish I knew the name of the singer in the bar she looks like an ex-girlfriend...<BR>Aloha-E
B00004IC9G|5.0|\\"Battle Hymns\\" was the second Manowar CD I've bought, the first being \\"The Triumph of Steel.\\" I knew enough that this was their first effort as a band, and was anxious to hear how they started it all. I actually read most of the liner notes before I played the CD for the first time, and I was very impressed, ready for a great album. What I heard when I DID play the CD was everything I expected: Old-school heavy metal, with the trademark Manowar sound already evident from the first notes of \\"Death Tone\\" (after the sound of those Harleys taching up, of course!) Highlights are many: The aforementioned \\"Death Tone,\\" \\"Metal Daze\\" (The first of MANY Manowar anthems!), \\"Shell Shock,\\" \\"Dark Avenger\\" (Eric's signature vocals and Orson Welles' haunting narration make for a DEADLY combination!), and \\"Battle Hymn\\" (In a word, AWESOME!!) It only took one or two listens through the CD until I put it on the list of my all-time favorite CDs. The only gripe I could possibly have is that it is a little on the short side. But I'll willingly overlook that and say HAIL MANOWAR!!
B00004YRQA|1.0|First, there is nothing about this to really write home about. It is a memory cart. You have to have it else your PS2 is worthless as a game machine. Most games won't even play unless you have one, so you have to have one. <br />My main gripe is the memory size. 8MB? C'mon! WRC and GTA3 both take up almost 1/3 of the capacity of this cart for their save games. And it is going to get worse. <br />Where are the 64MB carts?<br />Save yourself some money and don't buy this single pack. There is a twin pack of cards for only a few dollars more.
B00006JIAF|5.0|the strokes are ... talented and they sure can put on a show. i highly recommend these ... boys to anybody who likes to rAwK!
B00005NGSD|5.0|The music is before it's time with scorching vocals by Klaus Meine and out of this world guitar work by guitar slingers Rudolph Schenker &amp; Uli Roth. One for the books of classic rock albums. Highly recommended for any Scorpions fan...
B000066NW0|5.0|While some people may laugh or scoff Avril for supposedly being a 'poser'.. I love her!  I don't care what she wears, or if people think she's trendy or a 'punk poser' or whatever.. she has an awesome voice and sounds great!  <br />Poser or not, I love her songs.  She is awesome!  =)
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Jake Gyllenhaal shines in this film. He is funny and all though he has psycilogical problems he seems like the wierd neighbor next-door.This movie will change your life, it makes you think of the meaning of life and death. Being full of a deep subject you would think that this film would be too dark, but Richard Kelly does a great job mixing in comedy with tradgedy. The lines are witty and fun. The young stars are all up and coming, Maggie Gyllenhaal shines as the very believable sister. And Jena Malone is the caring, kind, and slightly problematic girl friend.<br />Everyone dies alone, but no one should die not having seen this film.
B00005JL96|5.0|I was very happy with Lilo and Stitch!  It's about time that Disney got more realistic with their characters.  While Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Mary Poppins may be 'masterpieces', this movie shows a more realistic view of some families.  Not all families are peaches and cream.  Lilo and her sister, Nani, are from a broken home, and while people may say that the scenes with the two of them are 'scary'... it does remind people that there are real relationships like this.  In fact, my family was much the same way.  This movie is much more realistic when dealing with families.  <br />Also, the character is more realistic, too.  Not everyone is 'stick thin' like all the characters in older movies.  Nani is one of the first Disney characters that actually has HIPS!  I applaud Disney on their more realistic view of not only the charachter design and their animation, but in portraying the broken home that actually does have a happy ending.  That hits closer to home for me than any 'fairy tale' story with completely perfect families and naturally thin characters.  <br />Lilo and Stitch, in my mind, is a MASTERPIECE!  =)
6304698658|5.0|This movie is hands down the best, most hilarious movie ever.  I have been watching it and rewatching it for several years now.  It is real life that is amplified by your own experiences of Christmas' passed.  I can laugh myself into a stupor every time I watch it.     &quot;Is Rusty still in the Naaaaavy?&quot;
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you know everything or nothing about WWII this movie is a MUST SEE. If you think the world doesn't have real heros, this movie is a must see. It gives you some insight into a period of time that too many of us never learned in school or have long forgotten. It will remind you of what real American values are and of the reality that is war. I can promise you this...before these ten hours are through, you will grow a respect and admiration for these men that is palpable. I hope that one day every high schooler will have to see this (or read the book--I suggest anyone do this anyway) before they graduate. Don't expect the kind of dramatic re-tell complete with a random love story as in movies like &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.  There are no &quot;cheesy&quot; moments of dramatic license that don't belong there.....the real story is dramatic enough on it's own.  The acting is outstanding...Damian Lewis is excellent as Major Winters, and David Schwimmer will surprise you with his wonderful performance as Sobol. There are too many great performances to name. The film appears to be very well researched and no expense spared when it came to making things as accurate as possible. If you are able to purchase an edition that includes the documentary companion as well, all the better...the performance of &quot;Bridgette O'Flynn&quot; alone is well worth searching it out. See it! See it! See it!
0440237688|5.0|Jonas lives in the ideal community, or so it seems. Everyone seems so content and safe. Doors are left unlocked, even during the night. However, Jonas soon finds out that there are sinister secrets lurking behind the pleasant veneer of his community. Can he save himself before it is too late?<br />The winner of numerous awards, including the 1994 Newbery Medal, this book expertly draws in the reader. Author Lois Lowry sprinkles forboding hints throughout the story as more and more clues are doled out. This thought-provoking book leaves the reader speculating the outcome even after the ending.<br />This is the kind of book that I could read again and again and never forget. It also contains an important lesson to society - security comes with a price.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It's really too bad that Dirrty was the first single off of this album, because it really represents \\"Stripped\\" poorly. No other track on this cd follows its formula at all.<BR>When Christina first came out with \\"Genie\\", the first thing I noticed was her style - not her voice (honestly). Tracks such as 'I'm OK' and 'The Voice Within' had me to tears, not because of the lyrics, but because of the raw emotion she conveys with her voice.  <BR>Plus, one of the definite highlights is that she's stopped screaming out every song. Christina's grown up (unlike Britney) and faces her demons unashamed. It's evident that she's put her heart and soul into this album, and I'd consider it a masterpiece.<BR>You won't regret buying this.
B00007BH5C|3.0|Perhaps my expectations were too high after the Fellowship soundtrack, but the Two Towers soundtrack fails to generate the same emotion. I listen to Fellowship several times a week, and it still causes a lump in my throat. I was REALLY looking forward to the Two Towers soundtrack, but it mostly leaves me cold.<br />Don't get me wrong, the music works for the movie, but by itself it just doesn't capture the imagination.
0316666343|3.0|I just finished this book last night, and although i enjoyed it... i must admit that i expected a little too much out of it because it was getting such great reviews. As i have read in a previous review, there were too many instances in the story that did not really belong... the ending was also a little abrupt. She watches her family for eight and a half years then comes down to earth for a little romp in a shack then leaves and can all of a sudden live peacefully in heaven without her family? in some ways it made sense, but for the most part, there was something missing. I recommend this book to everyone, but as far as the writing goes... i just didn't clash very well with it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|this cd just plain rocks! forget what the critic said, just have a listen for yourself. my friend and i started listening to this cd in her car, and i was like, wow! what great lyrics, and such catchy tunes! so i asked her who it was and she replied with john mayer. so then i went out and bought the cd and have loved it ever since. it's a great album and he deserves what's comin for him in years to come---great music with great fans. you can't help but humming along to each and everyone one of his songs, whether it's no such thing, the catchy pop tune..to not myself, a beautiful song that makes you, well just think! there is not a song on here i don't like..i love them all!! and i can't say that about that many cds! trust me, if you like even just one of his songs, you'll fall in love with the rest of his songs! i've rated some of the songs, it might be helpful to you!<br />1.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Her material is not even really my type of music but one listening won me over completely. <br />I would agree with some of the comments about her style being a bit laconic, but I don't see it as a fault, really, just a style. In any case, she has to have some room to improve over the coming years; if she's this good now, just think how good she can be at 30 or 40!<br />A truly outstanding first album!
0345448898|5.0|I'm 13 year old girl, and even at my age I find these books incredible. They're deep, creative, and hard to put down. I find nothing wrong with the religious perspective- it's not trying to persuade you to believe that, it's simply seeing everything from a different angle. Some adults, I guess, can't enjoy the books as much as my friends and I do, because they're too close-minded and strict in their ways.      But to any open-minded people, I surely recommend these books. Incredible. My favorite books, best I've ever read.      And to those who think they're &quot;horrible&quot;- loosen up. open your mind. look past the religious aspect, the &quot;mistakes&quot;, and see the books for what they are- a deep, thoughtful, fantastical journey.
B00000269M|3.0|Bad was released in 1987 almost 5 years after Thriller. The LP contains some of his most famous songs and the front cover is a classic. <br />However the lP does not come as a perfect work. I Liked most of the songs but I Didn´t like Speed Demon, Just Good Friends, Another Part Of Me and Dirty Diana. I thought these songs were fillers even though they were released as singels.<br />Every song of this album was released as a single and that´s maybe why the LP did not sell as much as Thriller. Michael who though this would outsell his 50 million seller predicessor was wrong.<br />The Album however sold all over the world but not as much as Thriller especially in the US where his album sales declined with each release. <br />Bad contains however some [good] tracks such as Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel and more than are both enjoyable and danceable. However I think more should be expected after more than 2 years of work. <br />The Material on Bad is also not like it was on Thriller. The songs and the lyrics are more self-indulgient and it´s like he is somewhat corny or cheesy. <br />But Bad made big waves in 1987-1988 and it sold well around the world and brought Michael a whole new legion of fans that had not been listening to Thriller or too young to remember. But also alienate a lot of fans of Thriller. <br />Overall allright album with good and bad songs that is worth listening to. <br />And By the way I don´t think Thriller is that great album and in my opinion his best album is Off The Wall which unfortunately was never followed up by another great album.
B00003CWTI|4.0|Magnolia was a very human story - I like how the characters unknowingly interact and cause significant changes in each other's lives.  It reminded me of another movie which is coming out in early 2003 called Baggage.
B000001FDK|4.0|This is probably one of the greatest soundtracks...rather than putting in only the bad songs like in newer soundtracks, they put ALL of the songs from the movie...so you may have some bad songs but you have 25 songs and most are good!
0792833279|5.0|This is it, ladies and gentlemen, THE film of the mid-90's.  Right up there with Pulp Fiction, The Usual uspects, and Fargo, this flick'll have you laughing, gasping, and laughing some more with the brilliant performances and clever screenplay.  Based on the Elmore Leonard novel, Barry Sonnenfeld directed this awsome movie with an all-star cast.  Keep an eye out for David Paymer and Bette Midler in some short...but great roles.   However, Denis Farina steals the show as Bones, a dumb-as-dirt mobster.   And, fans of GET SHORTY will be glad to hear that there may be a chance of a sequal.  NOT SURE...but Elmore Leonard just finished th follow-up to GET SHORTY, called BE COOL.   <BR>GET SHORTY is rated R for seemingly relentless profanity and some violence.  (just thought I'd warn you)  GET SHORTY IS A TRULY GREAT FILM, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B00004YB9Y|4.0|This is _not_ the usual type of Christmas music you will hear over the radio as the holiday approaches. Speaking strictly for me, if I never heard &quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot; again in my life, it would be too soon. So I thought I'd try out &quot;The Three Tenors&quot; and see what their Christmas album had to offer.<br />There are some problems with the music - Pavorotti seems to have some difficulty with English, but on the whole I did enjoy this album - and I'm not a fan of &quot;The Three Tenors&quot;. I would have picked some other music for them to do - the  John Lennon composition &quot;Happy Christmas / War is Over&quot; doesn't seem to work wel in this particular format, but it's entirely possible that I am too used to the Lennon/Ono performance.<br />So try something new for the Christmas season and listen to this cd. It has some very good cuts, especially &quot;Felice Navidad&quot;.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Tombstone is one of the most entertaining pieces of cinema to hit the silver screen in the past 15 years. Kurt Russell does a fantastic job portraying former Sheriff Wyatt Earp. Russell's Earp is at a crossroads in his life and sure, really, of only two things: he wants to make a lot of money and he wants to live near his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton). Needless to say when the Earp three move into the ragtag town of Tombstone business picks up a bit. The Earp's go into the saloon/casino business and start to clean up which begins to rub a few of the local cowboys the wrong way. All the ensuing altercations lead to the historic shootout at the OK Corral which is one of the films many highlights. Wyatt's sidekick is perhaps the best thing about Tombstone. Val Kilmer turns in an unforgettable performance as Doc Holiday. Holiday is by far the most intriguing character in the film and endears himself to the viewer almost instantly. Kilmer simply steals every scene he is in, which makes for one of the most memorable (and lovable) movie characters of all-time. Although Doc's hedonistic lifestyle eventually catches up with him in the end, it sure is great to watch this &quot;fabulous disaster.&quot; The film is long but it doesn't feel it. The pacing is fantastic and almost all of the movie is action packed. Overall, Tombstone is easily in my top five favorite films of all-time...and on some days it's number 1. Highest Recommendation.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Easily one of the best films of the 80s, Stand By Me serves as a generational touchstone emblazoned with unbridled emotion. Simply unforgettable. The performances given by the four young leads are remarkable and deserved of praise. River Phoenix's role as the charismatic leader of the prepubescent bunch is surprisingly mature and one that you would not expect from someone of his age bracket. Jerry O'Connell shines as Vern Tessio, the jolly and gullible fat kid. Plus, Feldman and Wheaton glow in their respective roles. <br />The DVD is filled with great features. The documentary on the Summer of Stand By Me is informative and gives you greater insight into the making of the film from many different angles -- from the cameras, to the characters and to the action. The music video is great as well.<br />I never seen this movie in its entirety until about a week ago, I always heard about the film from friends and from the media. But I never actually had the chance to see the film completely.<br />This film is a testiment to childhood and to youth. It will captivate you and bring back all those memories in your life that you cherish. Highly recommended.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This was the best movie I've seen since, well...The Fellowship of the Rings. Not a moment of it was boring. And I must say that Elijah Wood does a great job in bringing out his character, Frodo. And so does all of the other acters. I really think that you should see this movie. But make sure your there early because you'll want to get a good seat. I was late and had to sit in the front. Bummer
B00006CXXU|4.0|I bought the cd out of curiosity.  Its been 2-3 years since she last released her debut album and I have to say that I was blown away as I actually listened to each track without using the skip button like I always do.  And to be honest I didnt like the dirrty single.  The weird thing ?  Now I actually like the track it grows on you and it does have a funky beat. I was blown away when I realized this was the first album that I could listen to straight through that wasnt a rock album or a best of compilation.  Each track stands on its own and I am not a r&b, gospel, soul, or latin music listener.  And dont get me started on pop albums - the only pop albums I have ever bought were the last 2 madonna albums and some best of 80's pop act albums - and Stripped is one of the best albums I own next to Weezers, GNR, and Alanis Jagged Little Pill.  Standout tracks - Beautiful, Impossible, Soar, Infatuation, Get Mine Get Your and Cant Hold us Down.   Her image may be questionable - but I am not \\"listening\\" to her image but her music.  And as an adult she can look however which way she wants.  Truthfully, I dont know if she's crazy (for the obvious career suicide images) or if she's brilliant and knows something we dont.  Based on the quality of her album - I dont think she cares - Stripped is that good.<br />Lastly - I didnt give her 5 stars because while Stripped is impressive - I feel she can still do more and I am anxiously awaiting it.
B00005JL95|1.0|I'm not sure what inspired this movie, but they forgot the inspiration when they made it.  My daughter liked the purposeless violence and dimensionless characters so I guess it must be some sort of a cult college fad.  It put my father-in-law to sleep; I was not so lucky.<BR>Don't bother renting it and it you bought it, return it.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo &amp; Stitch is another magical Disney film,my daughter Dana and her father ( who is a big elvis fan )loved it.A great film with lots of laughter and sad bits too,a must for any disney &amp; Elvis fans SO GO AND BUY IT NOW! you won,t regret it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie could have easily made a huge impact if it had reached a larger audience in theaters. It is more thoughtful, complex, and thought provoking than American Beauty, though on a certain level it is a tad less realistic. I honestly don't want to spoil one second of this movie for you because it is so good. It's a story about a boy, a twisted looking rabbit, and the very concept of time and fate. It deals with issues of faith, sanity, love, fear, and destiny. Truly, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Go watch it and you will understand, but like I said, I don't want to spoil any more of it for you.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Who can be more controversial than Eminem? If u anwersed t.A.T.u. then your answer is correct. What makes them controversial? If you saw thier music video for \\"Ya Shola S Uma (All The Things She Said)\\" it was a pretty racy video. The song talks about a relationship between two teenage lesbian girls. With their holding hands and kissing each other it may turn out to be that t.A.T.u. are lesbian pop tarts to become a breath of fresh air. Even though I'm not gay or bysexual I still love thier music. When I first got thier debut album \\"200 Km/H In The Wrong Lane\\" for Christmas I was blown away with thier harmonies and voices. Thier lyrics were pretty racy but made the songs perfectly sense. The beats to every song feels like u are in a club dancing to them. One of my personal favorite tracks has to be \\"Clowns (Can You See Me Now)\\" with thier creepy lyrics and danceable beats this song kind of sounds like something that Bjork would wanna sing (but I think t.A.T.u. does an even better job with the song than Bjork would do). Another song that I like is \\"Stars\\" which is a very personal song with some serious lyrics but throughout the song they are rapping in Russian which I can't understand but that's ok with me. After hearing the album I immediately couldn't stop playing it. I love this album so much and I would definetly reccomend this album to anyone that likes Europop or likes controversial artists. This album is a must-have. From Russia with love, t.A.T.u. are definetly a breath of fresh air with thier lesbian image that they have to offer for the pop music world!
B00006CXXU|4.0|I must admit, I used to love the bubble gum pop; I was a fourteen year old girl in highschool, who didn't?  Then I grew up, and it drove me insane.  I've never really liked Christina that much, until now that is.<br />I always thought that she was just another voice, but on this album, she proves that she isn't.  It's very well defined through a range of slow ballads with a bit of R&amp;B and jazz, some rockier songs and some just-for-dancing-to songs. I like that she wrote most of her own songs.  They have meaning and you can actually identify with them sometimes.  It's amazing for the used-to-be pop princess to acutally have some meaningful music.<br />The only reason that I gave this cd 4 stars is that there is a song that sounds like it came right off the Mariah Carey 'Rainbow' album.  It's the second interlude.  There is also a song where it sounds like she's trying to be like Shakira.  Other than that, it's great.  If you want diversity, a good voice, and decent music with a good beat, you will love this cd.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I must say that I have never really been a fan of typical jazz music but I bought this album because of the great reviews....AND IT WAS WORTH IT! This album encapsulates Jones' (who, by the way, is Ravi Shankar's daughter) smooth and sultry tones.<br />This is by far one of the best albums I have ever heard.....plus she is half Indian so I can't complain about that!
B000002G9S|5.0|Colin Moulding (bass player /songwriter for XTC) loves this album and was inspired by the bass heard here. Take a listen to see why.
0345442970|4.0|Most of the prequel novels have been good, but few have been truly great. This book however, comes close. <br />  All the characters are portrayed excellently, particularly the relationship between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. As for Coll and Rella, I didn't want to get attached to them, but in the end the author's pure skill made me care what happened to them regardless. <br />  The plot is well done; complex enough to keep me interested, but not so hopelessly convoluted so that I couldn't follow what was going on. As other reviewers have pointed out this is largely a political thriller, but it also doesn't lack plenty of action for those of you who live for heart stopping fight scenes. <br />  Anyway, it takes place about a year before Episode 1, as the Republic enters its early stages of decline. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are dispatched with several other Jedi, including Vergere of the New Jedi Order, to monitor a few terrorist groups on a certain planet, but an assassination attempt on Chancellor Valorum complicates matters, as does an infamous though goodhearted outlaw known as Coll, who becomes tangled in matters... <br />  To reveal more of the plot would be a crime, so I'll just say that this is definitely one of the better prequel novels; one any Star Wars fan of any age should read.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Big is the word that best characterizes Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It's a film big in duration (179 minutes), big in special effects (just take a look at the army of tens of thousands of Uruk-Hais that Saruman is so proud of), and of course, big in intentions and scope.<br />It tells three different stories, involving the members of the former fellowship. The first story describes Frodo's and Sam's attempts to find their way to Mordor. The second story is about Merry and Pippin, being captive by a horde of Orcs. The final story starts with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli hunting down the Orc captors of Merry and Pippin and ends with the climax of the film, the over 35 minutes Helm's Deep battle.<br />What I did like about The Two Towers:<BR>-- The opening sequence featuring the fight between Gandalf the Grey and the Balrog was effective and gripping. The film certainly starts with a bang.<BR>-- I had my doubts about they way Ents (an ancient race of tree-like creatures) would appear on screen. Nevertheless, the result was most fitting.<BR>-- The inner struggle of the Gollum was convincingly depicted. As for the Gollum itself, it was an impressive piece of CGI work.<BR>-- The beautiful New Zealand landscape looks perfectly close to the Middle Earth that Tolkien himself had in mind.<br />What I did not like about The Two Towers:<BR>-- I would prefer it if the director told the story more in Tolkien's original, magical spirit (something that was evident in the first installment of the trilogy), than transform it into an action-packed extravaganza - but admittedly an engagingly told one.<BR>-- Seemed to me (probably mistakenly) that the producers decided to close the film a bit earlier than its natural book ending, giving it a more smooth finish, in order to avoid all this displeasure that viewers expressed by the way Fellowship of the Ring \\"abruptly\\" ended a year ago. In my humble opinion, the book ending would be more appropriate, having the viewers scratching their heads in anticipation.<br />Overall, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a grand movie, more easily accessible to the viewer than its predecessor, one that every fantasy adventure fan must see and should enjoy.
B00006M183|4.0|It's been a long time now since a new album release by Pearl Jam produced mass panic in the music public, but still Pearl Jam's seventh album sounds nothing like &quot;just another album&quot;.Once again, the first sound that comes to your ears once you've pressed play is not what you would have expected and after a while you realise that, although they never had an obvious high point of an album, each Pearl Jam recording has painted a different colour in your mind.Riot Act is most possibly PJ's most laied down album, not in musical terms but in terms of how they've been operating as a band.They start off with &quot;Can't Keep&quot;, a slow-burner with a mesmerising beat which warms things up perfectly for &quot;Save You&quot; , a maturer &quot;Brain of J&quot;.&quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;  is the grand song here and the first (not the only) point of the album that you'll tell yourself : &quot;it's definetely better than Binaural&quot;.Now the album has gone off.They continue with two tracks as typical Pearl Jam as experimental on terms of structure(but not as overdone as on certain Binaural tracks) and then comes in first single &quot;I am mine&quot; which proves that you needn't become epic to write a singalong melody.&quot;Thumbing my way&quot; starts off beautifully but doesn't take you there eventually.&quot;You are&quot; on the other hand sounds like nothing Pearl Jam have done before without sacrificing itself in the name of experimentation.In the second half of the album the band gets further relaxed with some tracks turning into interesting musical excursions and some others being credible only for the effort.&quot;Help help&quot; and &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; belongs to the first group, &quot;Get right&quot; and &quot;Arc&quot; to the second.And after you thought that all this is enough for just one album you get the closing track : &quot;All or None&quot; which is the closest Pearl Jam have ever gotten back to the haunting brilliance of Vitalogy's &quot;Nothingman&quot; and &quot;Immortality&quot;.But Riot Act is no Vitalogy,Vs or even Yield and it was never supposed to be.Riot Act is a new step in Pearl Jam's ever interesting and unique musical territory, and probably the most varying in sounds and moods.Maybe some devoted fans may never include Riot Act in their &quot;all time greatest Pearl Jam albums&quot; but everyone should own it just to remember there's still integrity and honesty to find in the constantly decaying music industry.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is endearing, interesting, and amusing. Watching Forrest go through life, inadvertantly participating in and making history, makes for a wonderful story. Sally Field, Robin Wright, and Gary Sinese also give great performances.<br />The second disk of features is a real treat. We get an extended behind the scenes glimpse of how the many special effects were created, from erasing Gary Sinese's legs to inserting Tom Hanks into newsreel footage. The FX are a big part of what makes this movie so memorable, and getting to see how they were created is fascinating.
0385486804|2.0|I myself have often thought about escaping society in much the same way that McCandless did, so I read this book hoping to understand what he learned and felt. You don't get his personal feelings and thoughts though, but instead just an adventure story of what he did. In part, this is due to his sparse journals which don't reveal his thoughts and feelings. Krauker tells the story in a confusing non-linear plot which left me trying to piece together the parts into a coherent journey. Mixing in the tales of others that have gone on isolated journeys did not help much. Overall, the book is confusing and does not help to reveal the deep spiritual meanings McCandless was searching for.
B00005JLS0|5.0|This movie has a great cast & great plot! THIS IS A SUCH AN AMAZINGLY FUNNY & CUTE MOVIE!!! I absouletly LOVE it!!! I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD!!!!!!!<br />I'm gonna buy it the day it comes out!
B000002G87|5.0|One of the 10 best albums in rock history, built on the foundation of Eric Clapton's personal life and a group of astounding musicians brought together only for a brief period in time.  This album simultaneously leaves me wanting much more from Derek and the Dominoes, while wondering how in the world they could have produced anything better anyway.  The combination of Clapton and Allman on guitar, plus Jim Gordon, Bobby Whitlock and Carl Radle is simply awesome.  While the pieces come together to create great music, they all retain their own identity and visibility throughout, whether Duane's slide work, Eric's lead, or Jim Gordon's piano work on Layla.<br />An album like this comes along too infrequently, and because of the brevity of the existence of Derek and the Dominoes (as opposed to the Beatles, Pink Floyd, or others who have released such gems), Layla is frequently overlooked, and almost on the fringe of being forgotten.  From the opening notes of &quot;I Looked Away&quot; to the closing piano solo of &quot;Layla&quot;, this record weaves together the great story that virtually everyone knows (if you don't, see any of the other reviews) in awesome fashion. <br />Although opinions will differ, in my opinion Derek and the Dominoes ranks as one of the greatest assemblies of complimentary musicians of all time. The music on this record is the evidence.  This is one of few records of which I always keep two copies - one to play, and one in inventory for when my current one wears out.<br />Finally, if I could have sat in on the recording sessions for a select few of the great records in history, this would have been one of them, along with Abbey Road and Dark Side of the Moon.  Rating: 5-stars - easily.
1577311523|5.0|It's very worth reading. The content is very complete. I found it as insightful as Geneva Nights. I'd read it again.
B000077VSJ|5.0|This is the best documentary ever made of the most influential Rock and Roll Band. What can be better than a documentary conceived, written and narrated by the Beatles themselves. The fottage is great, especially the rare 1963 concert footage. Overall, an outstanding collection. It will be great when this set is available on DVD.
B00000JLWW|3.0|...the love story in this movie is like giving Anne Frank a wacky best friend in the attic to make the story &quot;more interesting.&quot; Or words to that effect.<br />I would rather have seen a broader storyline encompassing more of the real people on the ship (Molly Brown, John Jacob Astor, Isidor Strauss, etc.) than the saga of fictional Jack and Rose. That having been said, however, I must add that the special effects are superb.<br />Between those two things, it comes out to an &quot;average&quot; review.
B00002MZ12|5.0|This is a VERY good Unplugged album. I love the way that she rearranged the songs. The songs she sang off of the album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; were definitely not as harsh in this CD. I really enjoyed the song &quot;Uninvited&quot; and &quot;Ironic.&quot; I would have liked to hear &quot;U R&quot; off of the album &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; because it is one of my favorite songs. I reccomend this CD to all those Alanis fans out there! It's a really good CD! This shows the softer side of Alanis, it's really nice. If you liked this CD, buy &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; and the DVD &quot;Live In The Navajo Nation&quot; because both the CD &quot;SFIJ&quot; and the DVD are great. Alanis is the master! Her lyrics are very soothing and relatable. Her voice is great and the music is awesome. You won't regret buying this CD! Enjoy!
B00004W52U|5.0|This cd kicks ... everyone who likes operation ivy at all should buy this. if you liek punk or ska,or any of the bands taht were influenced by operation ivy buy this cd. it has 27 songs. they are all good.i have brought this cd many places. This cd was not enough so after looking for a month i found seedy for 10 bucks which is a bootleg.im trying to find otehr bootlegs. Buy this cd. then buy the tribute,then buy seedy if you can find it.
6304539282|5.0|This is an awsome set of movies. It is 3 action packed films with a love story mixed in. I highly reccomend it.
B00007E8V4|5.0|After listening to the Chic 'N' Stu song.. I believe that song may be a tribute to the late Chick Hearn, play by play announcer of the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers basket ball team..he died earlier this year after their 3rd championship in a row.. Chick hearns partner STU Lance is still an announcer for the team. The pair were known as Chic and Stu.  The song starts out with a small bit from one of many of Chick Hearns terms or sayings.. that being the refridgerator door is closed, the lights are out, the butter's getting hard and the jello is jigglin'. I believe that is what the song may be about..RIP CHICK HEARN.
0792151712|2.0|I thought Judi Dench & Kathy Bates were brilliant. I thought the movie should have stayed on the tragedy aspect & not the love aspect. If we want to see a love story there is Sleepless in Seattle & Hope Floats. James Cameron however did depict very well the cruelness of the rich to leave the poor & servants on the ship. He also depicted with terrible reality the horror of being in the middle of a freezing ocean, no way of escape & knowing your fate of doom. The poor children dying. It was so very sad. The characters could have been written better. The first movie is much better.
B00006WUWN|4.0|If you asked me to rank the Austin Powers movies from best to worst I would put the best as the 2nd movie (The Spy Who Shagged Me), the middle as the original movie, and the worst as this movie (Goldmember). The movie wasn't as funny as the previous movies in the hilarious series. Destiny's Child member Beyonce Knowles did a good job, but her little &quot;Shazaam!&quot; chatch phrase and adding &quot;Sugar&quot; to the end of almost every sentence was kinda annoying. The mole jokes were very funny, as was the &quot;shadow&quot; scene in the doctor's offfice. One joke that not a lot of people in the theaters I was in (I saw it twice in the theaters) got was the &quot;Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto&quot; joke. That was hilarious. They could've done a better job on the joke with the satellite that looked like a big pair of &quot;....&quot; because it was easily predictible that they would try to bring that up again. The DVD was pretty good. I'm kinda new to the infiniFILM concept. In fact, I had never heard of it before. I really enjoyed it! It was very cool. I reccomend &quot;The Spy who Shagged Me&quot; instead of this movie, but it's still a nice one to own. Enjoy!
B00006G8G4|5.0|This is worth the buy but not for the movie. Even better is the bonus DVD you get with this gift set. The Stan Lee interview is absolutely fascinating. Stan Lee is a saint. This has got to be the nicest man in the world. While he does take credit for the creation of Spider-man, Fantastic Four, and others, he always mentions the team of people who helped to make them a success. This guy is an excellent story teller. You'll find that out when you hear him speak. It's no wonder his books have gone on to become a part of American culture.
B00002E233|5.0|Simple enough, Deep Blue Sea is about &quot;smart&quot; sharks who starts to attack people.  Of course there is a plot behind all this, but i will not spoil them here.  This movie stars LL Cool J, Renny Harlin, Samuel L. Jackson, Saffron Burrows, and Thomas Jane.  This movie is a non-strop thrilling ride.  This movie will also give you a few laughs.  If your a fan of Sharks, and underwater creature movies, or just love movies like I do, then I definitely recommend this movie. <br />This movie also contains neat EXTRAs &gt; Samuel L. Jackson and Director commentary, deleted scenes, stills gallery, filmographies, theatrical trailer and more!  <br />This movie is not a merry-go-round.  Dive in and enjoy the movie :).
B00006RCNW|5.0|Power, juice, rules, loyalties, all of it rolled up and swished around into one of the most enjoyable and complex dramas ever on TV.  The character you root for this week is the one you hate the next.  I wish I had all of the actor's and character's names at my fingertips because all of them are excellent and deserve a lot of credit.  <br />Chiklis is both menacing and heroic at the same time.  And somehow still seems sympathetic whether he's fixing a blunder by one the guys on his team, or skimming some drug money for himself.  The detective \\"Dutch\\" moves from cluelessness to genius to destroyed emotional cripple in a single episode.  The writing, acting, and shooting are amazing.  The individual episodes have complete plotlines, yet feed into the entire season (which has an impressive climax while maintaining the tension for season 2).  The alliances between the leads and supporting characters constantly change and twist as the characters look for personal advantage.<br />What's most impressive is how the series feels new and almost never hits a cliched clanger note (ehhh, with one exception that I'll let you find for yourself).<br />This is one of those series that make you re-arrange your schedule.  It's the only one I made an effort for. Easily the best thing on TV last year.  Thanks to the producers(or whoever) for allowing us to watch and share this fantastic series anytime.
B00005OWEG|1.0|While the original film was 2.1:1 aspect ratio, Paramount has butchered this film by pan and scanning down to fit a 16:9 widescreen TV.  Of course they don't bother to tell you that on the package.  So much for the director's vision.  Paramount, you should be ashamed.
B00003CX9E|2.0|For all the talk about how painstakingly this was reproduced, I can't for the life of me understand why it isn't available in the original widescreen format. This is visually a very nice reproduction of the film in TV format, but we will not see Welles' vision until it is produced for DVD in its original format.<br />The soundtrack on this is horrible. The sound is reproduced at a very low volume, forcing you to turn your TV volume way up. Then the few musical moments come blaring out at top volume. A little bit of compression and attention to detail would have taken care of this.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is much more than a breathtaking Western, it's an amazing film altogether. With elements of drama and film noir, this is a picture that shows us that there are some demons you can never put to rest, no matter how hard you try.<br /><br /> Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny, a once notorious and violent killer and thief. If Munny didn't like you, chances were that you wouldn't live long enough for him to tell you so. However, that was in the old days. Now, he's just a quiet and tired farmer who is a devoted father still in mourning of his dead wife. He's been straight for years and is trying to put all of his demons to rest, but you still get the feeling that no matter how hard he tries, he will always be haunted. An opportunity comes to him in the name of `The Schofield Kid.' He gives him a chance to be his partner and have him help on a bounty. Knowing that the money could help his family out, Munny finally decides to take the Kid up on the offer. He also brings with him Ned Logan; an old friend and partner. Little Bill Daggett is the Sheriff in town, and the thing he hates most are assassins. He will do anything in his power to take care of them and make sure they do not succeed on their killing. The last remaining part of the film stands out the most and is so well executed that it catches you off guard.<br /><br /> This really is a great film and it surprised me like I would've never expected. I don't like Westerns all that much, but this isn't your typical Western. That is probably why I enjoyed it so much. There is so much story and character development. You really are able to sympathize with Munny, despite his dark and violent past. You want him to be able to get on with his life and forget the past, although you know deep down that things will never be put to rest, and agreeing to go on this bounty only increases the chance of Munny returning back to his old ways. This isn't a Western where the line between good guys and bad guys are clear and the storyline is simple; good guy kills bad guys and gets the girl in the end. No, you won't find any of this here. In this story there are no clear good guys or bad guys, just regular people. This is a real story with real characters that you can feel for. There is a huge issue of morality that takes place, which is something you don't see much in Westerns.<br /><br /> Not only does Eastwood do a terrific job in acting, he also does an amazing job as director. He's a man with vision, and who more qualified to direct a film of this magnitude. I don't think the film would had been as successful had it been done by someone else. The cast is also outstanding. Morgan Freeman really does his role justice. Gene Hackman spreads fear inside of you as the mean and tough Sheriff. Richard Harris also deserves mention for his part as well. (He is sorely missed. He was a very gifted actor.) Everyone really did great in their roles and really knew how to bring the film together.<br /><br /> This new DVD edition really does the movie justice. Though it may not have the most special features, the one feature that stands out the most is the new digital transfer that really makes the picture look crystal clear. The sound is also very impressive as well. Special features included are as follows: Audio commentary by Film Critic and Eastwood Biographer Richard Schickel, Eastwood film highlights, awards list, trailer, and 4 documentaries.<br /><br /> &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is really a spectacular film that deserved the Academy Awards for &quot;Best Picture&quot; and &quot;Best Director.&quot; And it is a true masterpiece in my eyes. I think anyone who is a lover of films should give this one a try. Remember, you do not have to be a Western fan to enjoy this, because I am certainly not one. Some people may be disappointed in the lack of action or shoot-outs, but the film is about so much more. It's about morals and trying to put the past to rest. It's also about accepting whoyou are and that there are some things you will never be able to change, no matter how hard you try. This will end up being one of my favorites in no time. I was very surprised, indeed.ings you will never be able to change, no matter how hard you try. This will end up being one of my favorites in no time. I was very surprised, indeed.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series tops every war movie that I have previously seen; Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, you name it, BoB is 100 times better.Awsome battle scenes, touching drama, top-noch acting, this set has it all. It well portrays how a group of young men can become like brothers and bond during wartime. This is a must buy dvd set.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Very good CD, it makes me think about everything and its good when your working or when your sleeping. It have one or two &quot;bad&quot; songs but the rest are top quality. &quot;My Weekness&quot; always makes me think and put me in good mud. And if you enjoy the essays of Moby, then you'll love it! I advice you to buy it...
6303675212|3.0|When I watched this on Christmas Eve, my mother and grandma both cried their eyes out, which perhaps gives you an idea of how brimming this movie is with Christmas spirit.  It's basically about a little girl, Sophie (Mara Wilson), who doesn't believe in Santa.  But when she meets Kris Kringle (Richard Attenborough), a department store Santa she begins to have doubts.  However, all this seems to be challenged when Kringle is arrested for attacking a provocative customer and is forced to prove that he is really Santa Clause, conveniently represented by Sophie's mom's on/off boyfriend.  But Sophie will only be convinced if she's given a real family for Christmas.<BR>So you get the idea.  This is jam-packed with Christmas cheer, smiles and soft-focus sentimentality, which isn't altogether a bad thing, especially when watched at Christmas time.  Wilson, as usual, is an absolute delight in the role of disheartened little girl, making you wonder what exactly has happened to this gifted young actress who wowed audiences with her astute performances in movies such as this and Matilda.  Attenborough is also excellent as Santa/grandfather figure, being careful never to slip too far into sentimentality yet maintaining a moving performance.  Obviously this is a children's film and perhaps it's not fair to judge such a sweetly genuine film with a cynical eye; indeed, the resolution, where the whole city takes part in a `We believe' campaign' is pretty effective.  However, you do have to wonder why the spirit of Christmas has to reside in Santa, surely symbolic of presents rather than, as Kringle puts it, man's ability to repress their own anger.  Still, this is a nice little Christmas movie that will certainly please the kids, and judging by my family's response, older audiences too.  Old-fashioned?  Yes, but that's not necessarily something that should be sniffed at.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The plot is simply the best I have ever seen. The performance by Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey is masterful. I own three copies of the same movie and I still feel the urge to see it again. The movie is a jewel.<BR>Definately it is money well spent.
B000002U82|5.0|this album starts out the same way you and i did.  a faint heartbeat, that of an unborn baby, growing louder and stronger  as the baby growes bigger and stronger.  some strange noises and voices speaking of madness.(the fathers?). then the screams of childbirth.  the first concern after any child is born?  is he/she breathing. the first word that is sung is breathe. coincidence? after the song breathe it goes into a bizzare bunch of sounds that mean nothing, untill the alarms go off and you realize it was just the baby dreaming, what can you say about a baby? most people ask the normal questions. what TIME was he/she born, how much TIME will pass before its first step, word,etc. next song on the album is time. what else do babies have for us to talk about? emotion. the next song all emotion, no words. (the great gig in the sky). from there baby grows up real quick as they learn about money/possesions. MONEY. coflict.US AND THEM, the insanity these things can cause. BRAIN DAMAGE. it is a commonly believed idea that a persons life flashes before their eyes right before they die. this is covered in eclipse(all that you touch , all that you see, etc. then the heartbeat fades away, this album/person dies. the concept never falters. a human life, from the womb to the tomb. kinda makes all the other albums i've ever heard sound like just collections of songs. (not that that is a bad thing, but if you are looking for something truely unique, this is one of those things)
B0000542D2|4.0|As one of those lucky millions who was cellularly changed when the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan, I was so happy when this became available on DVD that I watched it uncritically in one gulp, loving every morsel. Then I watched it again. The picture is wonderful, but the musical sound, as others have noted, is particularly poor at times. It does not seem to blend in to the movie, it seems to stand out in some kind of sterile, sonic relief from the actual film. A very bad sounding echo is added to the TV show scenes, and the sound on She Loves You becomes abruptly, bafflingly muffled and muddy. Very disappointing. Why mess with perfection?  I also agree with another person who felt that the visual presentation of the package was poor. Right on--why not stay with some version of the original graphics, which were simple, brilliant, and familiar. This box is sterile-looking and has no resonance with any other visual iconcography associated with the film. Some stupid decisions were made here.... That being said, the movie is still brilliant, still fun, and still exciting to watch. The style is as original as the Beatles themselves. There is plenty of social commentary, and enough thematic &amp; visual motifs to keep the film students working hard. Maybe Miramax will wise up and reissue this in a more reverent fashion. Sometimes change for the sake of change is not a good thing. Messing with this film was like putting out a version of the Bible in some weird font with illustrations by Leroy Neiman.
B000063T0T|5.0|This music compilation is definately worth buying. The 2nd CD has several songs that are unique to the film or not on the 1st CD.  The 1st CD is also wonderful. Being a huge fan of the movie--and previously having some shocking &quot;that's not how it's supposed to sound!&quot; made for radio moments--I was unsure of how some of the songs not sung by the original actor/actors would sound. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. David Bowie's rendition of &quot;Nature Boy&quot; and Beck's &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; are just 2 of the many wonderful songs on this 1st CD. The one caution I would raise is that these 2 CD's appear to be the same as buying the Moulin Rouge CD's # 1 &amp; 2 seperately. The one bonus I can find on this set is song # 16 on the 1st CD...&quot;Lady Marmalade Thunderpuss Radio Mix&quot;...(it's ok, but nothing special.) Bottom line: If you decide to get this 2 CD set, the music is enchanting and wonderful to listen (and sing) to; If you decide to get anything else, I recomend getting Moulin Rouge 1 &amp; 2 in order to get the same wonderful &amp; theatrical effect.

B00005UOXL|5.0|Billy Idol's 1982 debut broke the singer into America but it took a while for the music industry to notice Idol's exceptional talents.  In 1981 Idol left his punk rock band Generation X, frustrated with the limitations of punk rock.  In October he released an EP called DON'T STOP.  The EP was a chart failure but did exceptionally well in the dance club circuit with just hits as MONY MONY and DANCING WITH MYSELF.  In July of 1982 Idol released his self titled debut LP.  The record made little impact on the charts all it did was produce a minor Top 40 hit HOT IN THE CITY.  The album was considered a failure until MTV saved the day when they aired an eye popping music video of WHITE WEDDING.  The album was rereleased a year later with a new front cover and the final track CONGO MAN being replaced by a short inferior version of DANCING WITH MYSELF to boost the record's status.  The rest was history...<br />The music itself still stands strong today and even though many critics say it hasn't aged well, the album actually has (especially for 80's music).  This album has always been vastly underrated and overshadowed by 'Rebel Yell' but on it's own it's a great album.  Although WHITE WEDDING (PART 1), HOT IN THE CITY and DANCING WITH MYSELF are the record's highlights, some of the other tracks are equally as strong.  Particularily the killer opener COME ON COME ON, the jazzy SHOOTING STARS and the rockers HOLE IN THE WALL and DEAD ON ARRIVAL.  The other songs are great as well.  NOBODY'S BUISNESS has a killer guitar solo by the brilliant Steve Stevens (who deserves just a much credit as Idol for his career).  LOVE CALLING is an interesting expirementation of Tribal beats with Rock music.  IT'S SO CRUEL is a dreamy ballad that proved Idol could do more than just 'rock'.<br />The cd is nicely remastered with some good liner notes but the only problem is that the record company neglected to include any bonus tracks on this reissue as they had with the `Rebel Yell' remaster.  There were a few songs left in the can, particularily the original release's final track CONGO MAN (which has yet to appear on cd) as well as the DON'T STOP EP tracks MONY MONY, UNTOUCHABLES, BABY TALK and a longer version of DANCING WITH MYSELF.  Otherwise this is a nice little album that is a great addition to anyone's music collection particularily Idol fans.  This is afterall Vital Idol!  Highly recommended!r.

B00006AG5N|5.0|I was born just before The King passed on to the other side. I wasn't around for the Ed Sullivan show appearance, nor his famed 1968 TV special, or his Las Vegas years. I could never relate to Elvis the way my mother could. I was definetly skeptical of the sound quality. But when I put this album in, it was as if these songs were just recorded yesterday. I finally feel like I can relate to this wonderful artist. His music resonates through my stereo & computer. I can feel his emotions. All of the songs sound fresh & new. It's hard to imagine that some of these songs were recorded over 45 years ago!!! My generation & generations to come finally have an Elvis album we can truly listen to & appreciate. Rest in Peace Elvis.

0783244320|5.0|Galaxy Quest, as I'm sure everybody already knows, is a send up of Star Trek. Tim Allen is cast in the William Shatner role, Sigourney weaver is the Uhura of the show and a dead pan Alan Rickman is the Leonard Nimoy of Galaxy Quest. Having had their show cancelled several years previously the cast of the now defunct Galaxy Quest make their living by doing personal appearances at conventions organised by their all too obsessive fan club. However their careers are given a new lease of life, and a definite change of direction, when they are enlisted by some very hapless (but genuine) aliens to assist them in fighting a war against a ruthless enemy who has been terrorising their `people'. The unfortunate ET's however do not realise that Galaxy Quest is merely a TV show and instead believe that each episode is a historical document. From this false belief the unfortunately dim-witted and naive aliens have modelled their whole ethical system on the show and created an exact replica of the Galaxy Quest star-ship to assist them in their quest for survival.<br />I love Galaxy Quest. There I said it. I think it is one of the funniest yet most under appreciated movies of the last few years. I own it on DVD, yet every time it is on satellite TV I still end up watching it again and again and laughing again and again. To put this in perspective I'm not even a great fan of comedies, I'm not even a great fan of Tim Allen or Sigourney Weaver (although they are both decent actors) but this movie just tickles me pink and has me giggling like a kid every time I watch it.<br />This movie is simply a joy. Unlike many spoofs it doesn't over egg the mix. It is told straight and there are no nudge nudge wink wink asides to the camera. Every joke pretty much hits its mark and there is so much fine observational humour that it perhaps requires a couple of viewings to completely appreciate its subtleties. Galaxy Quest is in many ways the sci-fi equivalent to the Scream movies, in that it sends up all the old clich&eacute;s of sci-fi movies and of course in particular, Star Trek. That said it is not done in a disrespectful manner. I grew up with the original Star Trek and as an adult have enjoyed The Next Generation immensely, which definitely added to my viewing pleasure of Galaxy Quest, which is absolutely choc-full of witty knowing dialogue. Much of the credit for this must go to the invention of writers David Howard and Robert Gordon for what is obviously an affectionate and extremely clever and knowledgeable spoof. Kudos also to Director Dean Parisot for his subtle direction and decision to play the movie straight. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, in fact the whole cast are just great. Galaxy Quest never misses a beat and I highly recommend it!<br />Five stars.s up all the old clichés of sci-fi movies and of course in particular, Star Trek.

0446677450|1.0|This is 1 of the most worthless financial books I have ever read. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I can tell you the jist of what he says : Have assets not liabilites (duh...). Your house is a liability not an asset. Evidently, to learn some ways you can accumulate all those assets you have to buy his OTHER books!!!<BR>  Although he mentions that the rich incorporate themselves, he does not go into how one does this, why, what it does for you, & any reasons why you should not.<BR>  This book is like 1 of those TV get-rich infomercials where they keep saying \\"this system will get you rich\\". We watch the whole thing because we keep thinking they will mention HOW. It is nothing but a commercial to buy the book,system,seminar,etc.<BR>I read this whole book for the same reason - thinking he would eventually get to the HOWs. But he never does. Any coincidence he is a prince of infomercials?

B000002TPS|5.0|first of all for those of you who think dave cant sing are not real metal fans , go with nsync or something, Dave's voice fits the metal genre and holds his own.  Really its not really about singing the music.  Ok now I am talking about Youthanasia the best megadeth album there is (rust in peace is good but overated really).  I bought this after Cryptic and just sunk into the music. Man as soon as I heard the crushing guitars with daves voice stretching for the chorus in \\"Reckoning Day\\" I was like this is it, what I expect megadeth to sound like. Now I base all the other albums to Youth.. .\\"Train of Conquences\\" is not as good as everyone says , Yeah I love it but I prefer , the awesome 80's sound of \\"Addicted to Chaos\\" probably my fav. Megadeth tune to date.  I play guitar and megadeth has alot going in that department, heh heh.  I got tired of metallica's stuff and went with megadeth and I will stay forever. Youthanasia song review<BR>\\"reckoning day\\" is a ultra heavy song, not speedy just heavy , when it builds up to an awesome catchy chorus where dave stretches his voice , i love it, also has a little acoustic breakdown that I always love about megadeth.<BR>\\"train of conquences\\" goes a little beyond megadeths style to a more jazzy, funky intro.  Chorus also takes away to sound like it fits, but has a super heavy part that is followed by a solo.<BR>\\"addicted to chaos\\" I was so dissapointed that this song never became a hit or sung live. It beats the hell out of \\"Train..\\" from the beggining of the song till the end i was so amazed how awesome this song is I immediately repeated the song and started to learn the lyrics. Being a guitar player and learning this song was a good experience not hard , awesome guitar in the chorus it just complements dave singing,  I thought he was saying in the first line, \\"entering my jealousy \\" instead of \\"In a dream I cannot see\\" by the way the lyrics are superb.<BR>\\"a tout le monde\\" second fav. song on the album. slower than the usualbut one of the best. also good lyrics, dave singing the chorus in french was cool, sad song though about some guy dying or something and music sets the mood for someone passing away after saying his dying words. awesome guitar ending , classic megadeth at the end.<BR>\\"elysian fields\\" heavy song , took me a couple of listens to get used to it, has the sound of \\"peace sells\\".  Songs chorus is like an anthem which is cool.<BR>\\"Killing Road\\" the main riff will always be an inspiration on my guitar playin, I cant get enough of it. As far as the rest song its pretty awesome, though kinda of plain , basic intro, chorus ,solo stuff like that.<BR>\\"Blood of heros\\" I luv personally love this song. The chorus especially almost like \\"addicted to chaos'\\" . The lyrics are really deep, I think it could have made on some kinda tribute to the heros of 9/11.Really heavy song, classic.<BR>\\"Family tree\\" awesome song though the lyrics might not setttle with some people cause its about some who is sexually abused by a family member, which happens all the time and a hard subject to talk about, Probably the catchiest chorus on the album \\"let me show how I love you, its our secret you and me,,,let me show you how I love you, but keep it in the family tree\\" This song fits the album perfectly it defines Youthanasias sound.<BR>\\"Youthanasia\\" pretty heavy song, though the vocals are a little gritty in  the verses, fans of \\"Symphony\\" will like it cause its got an awesome chorus.<BR>\\"I thought I knew it all\\" almost like a ballad, cause it has ballad like chorus like \\"A tout le monde\\". Another song that defines this albums song. <BR>\\"Black Curtains\\" probably the heaviest song on the album. It would definetly fit \\"rust in peace\\" or \\"peace sells\\".  Awesome song.<BR>\\"Victory\\" fastest song on the album what makes this song so cool besides the awesome guitar work by Mustaine, and friedman is that the lyrics has  names of megadeths older songs in the lyrics to tell a story about how dave overcame his drug habit.<br />This cd shoule defenitely be in everybodys collection. People should stop comparing their music to metallicas, megadeth is in a whole other ballpark cause metallica stuff is plain, Dave has complexed guitar riffs and bad choruses. anywayz pick it up
B00006CXXU|4.0|I like the CD very much and the music is nice but her image has gotten a bit out of control. Anyways, I like her music so I went ahead and got the album. Now for the songs:<br />Stripped Pt. 1 - ok, introduces her: 6/10<BR> <BR>Can't Hold Us Down (feat. Lil' Kim)- I like it, it has a catchy beat!: 8/10<br />Walk Away - fairly good song: 7/10<br />Fighter - one of my favorites, best with a high base! GREAT!: 10/10<br />Infatuation (interlude) - ok, its an interlude: 6/10<br />Infatuation - clever and catchy, i like it!: 8/10<br />Loving Me For Me (interlude) - I like this interlude, it's a lovely introduction to her next song: 7/10<br />Loving Me For Me - I like this song a lot, it may be a slow song but if you listen to the lyrics, it's a very powerful song!: 8/10<br />Impossible - cute song, jazzy w/ Alicia Keys: 8/10<br />Underappreciated - it was ok, barable to listen to 4/10<br />Beautiful - very positive song - 10/10<br />Make Over - has a tune of its own, it's ok: 6/10<br />Cruz - beautiful and relaxing: 8/10<br />Soar - it's a nice song: 8/10<br />Get Mine, Get Yours - i love this song! 10/10<br />Dirrty - most people have heard it. I find it to be rather catchy: 8/10<br />Stripped Pt. 2 - interlude i think, its ok: 6/10<br />A Voice Within - lovely song: 8/10<br />I'm OK - it's ok, this the most I could give it: 7/10<br />Singing My Song - clever, ok way to end the album - 8/10
B00006LFGD|4.0|Your appreciation of this collection of \\"Duets\\" will likely depend on your feelings of Barbra's duet partner on the song. Barbra's voice has been beautifully consistent for decades now, so you'ree not likely to like or dislike a song based upon her performance as much as her partners.<br />I do believe this collection would have been better off by omitting the Ray Charles, Kris Kristofferson, and Harold Arlen duets. While these singers are fine in their own rite, these performances are either weak, jarring or awkward. (Heck, Harold Arlen isn't even really a singer! - A little bit of name dropping Barbra?)<br />Let's face it, this collection runs the range from the \\"A\\" list greats (Judy Garland, Johnny Mathis, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles) to the \\"B\\" list greats (Donna Summer, Neil Diamond, Celine Dion, Barry Manilow) to the \\"C\\" list singers (Barry Gibb, Bryan Adams, Vince Gill, Kim Carnes, Michael Crawford) to the \\"just competent enough\\" vocals of Kris Kristoferson, Don Johnson and Harold Arlen. Josh Groban could easily find himself in that \\"B\\" list someday if his career pans out, only time will tell.<br />You don't have to be a dyed-in-the-wool Streisand fan to know that the \\"duet\\" with herself on \\"One Less Bell To Answer/A House Is Not A Home\\" is perhaps the best track on here. Other singers were simply not in peak form (Frank Sinatra) or were just over-bearing (Celine Dion).<br />Still, 7 of these songs made the Billboard Hot 100, while \\"Tell Him\\" did well on the A/C chart and the Vince Gill duet made the Country chart (oddly enough, so did the Neil Diamond duet), so there is no shortage of \\"hits\\" here...<br />Still, I think it is time for Barbra to retire the duet thing for awhile and seek a new direction for her music... something fresh and contemporary would be nice. If she does do the duet thing again... I hope she sticks to singing with the truly great artists instead of mediocre talents or the fresh face of the moment. She has never recorded a duet with EltonJohn, Billy Joel, Aretha Franklin or even Garth Brooks. Even something with singers who are often compared to her such as Linda Eder or Lara Fabian would be nice. <br />Well, it seems Barbra's next album in 2003 will be the long overdue \\"Hollywood Album\\", a collection of songs from movies... hopefully it will do for Barbra's recording career what \\"The Broadway Album\\" did after \\"Emotion\\".
B00005QXXO|4.0|This is the newest release by radiohead which is the strongest contender to be the biggest mainstream rock band since U2( not that im a big fan of U2 but oh well) , it consist of live recordings of 7 songs from Kid A and Amnesiac and a previously unreleased song : true love waits . The cd is a mixed bag , some songs loose a lot , a lot!! live ,while others sound superior to the studio recordings , now im gonna give my opinion one by one .<br />1. The national anthem : 2/5 In kid A this song is as it title suggest anthemic , but in this live version it has lost all of its punch , the bass line is still great but the lack of horns in it just kills the feeling<br />2. I might be wrong : 4/5 It is a pretty good rendition of the studio song , except of a really soft vocal performance by Thom Yorke , still one of the highlights of the album.<br />3. Morning Bell : 3/5 I didnt like this song on any of its version ( there's not much difference between them , is it? ) , it is a good perfomance very true to the original.<br />4. Like spinning plates : 5/5 Now this song really grew a lot in the live performance , in amnesiac it comes off as a strong track but with not much feeling , while in here it is haunting and probably the most powerful moment on the cd.<br />5. Idioteque : 5/5 This song was touching and full of sentiment on Kid A , and it just sounds great live , is a really upbeat song ,really cool.<br />6. Everything in its right place : 4/5 It keeps itself true to the studio version , it sounds good , but is a song that i really didnt get into .<br />7. Dollars and Cents : 4.5/5 A favorite live song for a longtime , its powerful and it brings back memories of the Ok computer era.<br />8. True love waits: 4.5/5 Thom Yorke and an acoustic guitar , sweet song , but not really that great.<br />Is radiohead the greatest mainstream rock band , uhm maybe , will they change rock world once again in 2003 ; i hope so , but i also hope they drop out a lot of the electronic edgeand go more amnesiac than kid A ; will radiohead-like bands hailed as the best thing since bread came sliced grow in number , god i hope not! , is this cd worth checking out : definitely
B00006F7S4|3.0|I've listened to this album a bunch of times to try to understand what I'm missing, and I still don't get it. Sure, the sound is pretty, and the absence of Beck's soulless-sounding, smart-ass irony is a welcome change.  But with the possible exception of the lovely \\"Golden Age\\", there's nary a memorable song in sight on this pleasant but forgettable release. The fact that Beck has invested this record with irony-free gravitas doesn't make it the \\"masterpiece\\" all the blowhard journalists are calling it (look, Rolling Stone also gave Jagger's pathetic last one 5 stars), nor do string arrangements or mopey singing. It's the songs, stupid!  Check out Elliott Smith and Clem Snide for better examples thereof.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|This is a good movie but I have gotten acustomed to seeing vampires turn into ash. The 1st movie is a little better because every part was fresh and original. The storyline was also more dramatic. In this sequel,Blade seemed to have spent less time a the gym, his muscels are a tad smaller. <BR>I still do recommend that you buy this sequel because it has a couple of excellent fights sceens between Blade and the boss of the rebel vampires. And this sequel is a lot better than all the other comic book based movies (X-men,Batman,etc). And if you haven't, buy the first part, that one is a definite 5 star.
B000002MG1|1.0|I just don't get it.  Virgin Records lists this as the seventh best album ever.  I can't figure out why.  When Man on the Moon came out I hated it, but I figured there was something else on the album that made up for it.  There wasn't.<br />I bought mine used, and at [the listed price], I think I got robbed.  Nothing on here is particularly impressive.  The \\"emotion\\" that is supposed to sell the song can be found in equal quality on a Backstreet Boys album, and they have catchier tunes.<br />All in all, this is NOT the decade-defining album the producers try to sell it off as.  Save your money, or better yet, take the money you would have spent on this album and bet your friends that the members of REM end up homeless within the span of five years.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This is a great movie! It is not any kind of copy cat time cheating movie. Most of the ideas are very original. And the special effects soooooo amazing! You witness skyscrappers being consturcted in a matter of seconds. And yes there is an orbiting moon thats being partially destroyed. I was really encaptivated by the story. It has eveything, action, suspense, and romance. The songs and music lines are also great. Thats probably because the female star is an Irish singer. She demonstrates excellent acting in this movie and her beauty is very exotic. This is a great movie to watch, especially with your girlfriend.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I heard &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; on WWE, thought it was pretty catchy and cool, then i heard it at the bowling alley o.O I searched for WWE Victoria in Audio...The filename was Tatu - All The Things She Said So i searched there and grabbed the most popular songs...I have this stuff on repeat...It's a great song..And I'm getting the CD
B00006LLNU|5.0|The magic is that every time you listen to this CD again, you find something new something better. It is different yet strangely familier... I hope they keep like this.
B00005UKE0|3.0|Nothing really leaped out at me here. A lot of money for a little music.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Regardless of the bashing from previous reviews this movie is actually quite good. Granted the plot could have been better, but for car lovers like myself I really enjoyed it. It may only be for the select few amongst the crowds but I for one like racing of all types and tuned-up cars, somewhat skimpy women and action scenes is more than enough entertainment for me. Yeah, I guess that is shallow but hey I like easy-going movies.<br />As for teaching people to drive insane and kill people in the streets...anyone who would actually do that is dumber than words can say. If your dumb, nothing is going to change that so don't buy this movie if that is what you expect yourself to do afterwards. Second of all anyone in their right mind would realize that the action is done with professionals, and also in the end they suffered consequences for their \\"evil\\"(as Ian put it) actions. No one should go out and deal in thievery, drugs, or participate in illegal street racing, it is very dangerous and WILL just land you in jail or the morgue.<br />I give the movie 2 thumbs up for well tweaked cars.
B00003CY6M|2.0|Start with the terrific, self-deprecating John Cusack, add the beautiful Kate Beckinsale with NYC as a backdrop, and this film had huge potential. Unfortunately, the film is a flop.  <br />Three big flaws:<BR>1. Main characters - neither is very likeable (this is no Harry met Sally)<BR>2. Plot - they &quot;just miss&quot; each other too many times. This becomes silly and is too much to endure.<BR>3. Pacing - so slow that the tension is exchanged for tedium<br />One high point: The two main characters do have nice chemistry when together. <BR>Unfortunately, this is not enough to carry the film.
B000001FI7|4.0|This CD has some wonderful tracks, but there are a few I have no interest in. Sometimes it seems too much alike or too different from the other songs. It's not totally reliable, but they are a solid group. At least listen to it.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers is a brilliant piece of work. It is just as enjoyable, if not more enjoyable then the first film. The Two Towers cannot really be better then The Fellowship of the Ring because they are really, in a sense, the same movie, only cut into three different parts, and are being released at three different times. This film is, however, darker and alot more intense then The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring. I have seen it twice already, and I will gladly see it many more times.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I wasn't expecting much out this album (which was the right thing for me to do, because it made me like this album even more), especially considering the fact that I've never liked Chris' whiny voice and never really did care much for Soundgarden's music. I just couldn't picture blending the no-nonsense, in-your-face, kick-... Rage style with Cornell's style. But again, the Rage boyz (Tom, Tim, and Brad) showed why Rage was the best band out there for the past 10 years or so years. In this album, they proved why they are great musicians. Tom's patented unearthly guitar sounds and unique style, and Tim and Brad's tight rhythm, all which defined Rage, are present here. They proved they can play with anyone and play any style. The best song on this album, \\"I Am the Highway\\" is unbelievably beautiful. You would never guess it's the former Rage playing it. Ditto \\"Like a Stone\\". Both songs have a Led Zeppelin-ish style. The only song that sounds anything like the old RATM is \\"Cochise\\"...the no-nonsense hardcore rock. This album just rocks, and it's the best thing out there right now that proves that rock, whether classic or modern, lives on through Audioslave!! Heck, I'm even starting to respect Cornell after this effort. He's no Zack, but he is a good songwriter. Wish he had a better voice, but we can all learn to live with it. Overall though, this is one awesome album, a must-have for metalheads like me.
B00005JKL8|1.0|Someone tell me why Gene Hackman took this role.  If you are looking for the Bosnian equivilant of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" you are looking in the wrong place.  If you are into totally unrealistic, jingoistic, shoot em up movies war movies then this is for you.
B000066NW0|3.0|Okay, so everyone says that this is the best album on the planet.<BR>I sort of agree. Complicated and Skater Boi have had thier chances on the radio times a million. \\"Losing Grip\\" is easilly the best track on here. Naked is a close second and Mobile is third. I'm with you rates at the mid-way point but other than that her songs aren't all they're supposed to be. Punk is new and some people might try to like her and I agree that Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton need to measure up.<BR>However, if you really want to buy this and your birthday money's going towards it my advice is...don't buy it!!!!
0425098478|4.0|This is a good book for first-time managers.  It's short, quick and to the point.  The biggest benefit is showing that reprimands and praise deserve equal time.  Employees don't grow if they don't make mistakes, and some of the greatest learning opportunities come from reprimands followed by encouragement.<br />Since the whole books takes about an hour to read, it's well worth your time.
B000069HK2|5.0|First of all......where have they been for the past 5 or 6 years? All that teeny bopper [stuff] was getting out of hand. The Used are one of the best punk/rock bands I have ever heard...Bert has a very unique voice that I like. I think that \\"On My Own\\", should be there next single because it shows a softer side of the band(you know what I mean...). If you would like to leave a comment....email me at Spongebobrocker2@aol.com!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|this is such a great film! i rented it and i slept thru more than half of it. thats because its not what you expect. i thought it would be a love story/factual and informative. no way! well, i watched it again 2 monthes later and i was blown away! this is one of the movies where you have to let reality go and completely submerge yourself in the plot. let the music tell the story. it is truely a masterpiece with a great soundtrack and wonderful special effects. the plot is excellent too. it is an amazing movie because one second you are laughing and the next you are crying. the dvd is beautifully put together with tons of special features. this whole movie is great, JUST GIVE IT A SECOND CHANCE. excellent, worth more than 5 stars!!
B00006LSM3|5.0|One of the very best George Harrison albums in his solo career. \\"BRAINWASHED\\" ranks right up there with CLOUD NINE, 33 1/3 and ALL THINGS MUST PASS.  A classic.
1558216847|5.0|I have read this book several times. It's a good read for someone going thru trying conditions. <BR>The part about the encounter with the two abominable snowmen (or were they male and female?) was very engaging. He describes them in some detail, which surpasses some of the stories you hear about them.
B00005JL95|5.0|Many recent Disney releases have contained quick little visual references to earlier films; &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; has at least two. Have fun finding them -- I did.<br />Also, the animators had a bit of fun with Lilo: Although early in the film she is accused of biting another child, unless I'm very much mistaken she is the only character in the entire film who is drawn without visible teeth.
B0000009OP|5.0|You're still under the yoke of the guitar-bass-drums format. Much has been said about the line-up of the band, so I feel it might be useless of my time (and therefore, yours too) to explain what Morphine's concept was at first of all. But an album like this just can't be missed, it's so full of energy, not in an intensity manner, but in a full streak of spirit here, even at their melancholic moments, in all Sandman's verses. The lyrics here are awesome too, in a &quot;Kerouac-esque&quot; sort of, focusing on affair situations, revealing a very affecting side of the band. My favourite ones here are, without hesitating, the pensive sears of &quot;Candy&quot; and [the self-explaning] title track.<BR>Don't think twice about it.
B000069HK2|5.0|When I first heard these guys I knew they were already gonna be a new favorite band of mine. After hearing songs like \\"The taste of ink\\" and \\"A box full of sharp objects\\", I was already out to purchase the cd. After listening to it all, it just kicked alot of.... from its hard riffs and emotional singing. My favotite song on the cd is \\"A Box Full Of Sharp Objects\\" because I just love how that song sounds, plus the screaming in it helps it out alot too. One of my favorite new bands of 2002. Anyone familiar with the town in Utah Orem because thats were there from...Orem, Utah. Buy this cd now because The Used will kick your...., and you'll love it!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|A stunning TV-series and a stunning boxset!If you're into military and recent history DO NOT PASS THIS!The visuals are excellent and the sound is rocking the house,actually to the extent of causing me almost an heart attack.Sudden blasts of incoming arty are quite,er,realistic as is the para-drop in part 2...One thing I also liked was the total lack of &quot;hero-machine gun fired from the hip killing dozens of enemies-superficial flesh wounds in the shoulder&quot;-scene that usually is incorporated in all gun-related films.
B00005QG9I|5.0|This is without a doubt the best album I have ever bought..and by far the best Incubus album yet.. I have almost all of thier albums and I am a huge fan.. and I must say that they have once again redefined themselves and I love it! There is definatly something for everyone on this album- I'll break down the album and give you my opinion of each song...<br />Track #1- Nice To Know You<BR>Love this song.. it's got the heavy metal sound but then beautiful lyrics and melody by Brandon throughout the song. <br />Track #2- Circles<BR>I love the guitar riff.. and they lyrics are the kind that make you stop and think..excellent song<br />Track #3- Wish You Were Here<BR>Definatly the best song on the album.. I love Brandon's voice and the lyrics are so descriptive and vivid.. The combination of lyrics and melody make this a wonderful song<br />Track #4- Just a Phase<BR>This song starts out slow with DJ Kilmore scratching and a beautiful melody.. then Brandon comes in adding a really mellow sound to the beginning of the song.. I could actually listen to the first minute of this song over and over.. then towards the end it gets heavier... when I listen to this song I feel like I've listened to three different songs because it has so many different vibes to it.. Good Song!<br />Track #5- 11 AM<BR>Another song that's on the slower side but I love the lyrics to this one... I can definatly relate to this song... <br />Track #6 Blood On the Ground<BR>This is a bit heavier sound, but the lyrics are very deep... It has a great message.. great song<br />Track #7 Mexico<BR>This is a mellow and slow song.. but definatly one of my favorites off the album.. It combines Brandon's great voice with a wonderful melody on guitar.. excellent song!! <br />Track #8 Warning<BR>This is more upbeat and heavy.. not one of my personal favorites.. but still.. a great song<br />Track #9 Echo<BR>This song starts out with great guitar and an amazing drum beat... this is another one of my personal favorite.. I could leave this one on repeat and definatly chill for hours.. I absolutly love the lyrics too.. Brandon's voice on this one is jus amazing...wonderful song!!<br />Track #10 Have you Ever<BR>This is very heavy and I love the melody of this song.. The chourus is the kind that sticks in your head.. nice song<br />Track #11 Are you In?<BR>This is probably the &quot;funkiest&quot; song of the whole album.. DJ Kilmore has some really awesome parts in this song.. the lyrics are simple but the melody is one that you can put on and &quot;chill out&quot; with.. the bass gives it a relaxed feel too.. excellent song!<br />Track # 12 Under My Umbrella<BR>This is probably the heaviest song on the whole album.. I absolutly love the lyrics.. and Brandon's voice is outstanding.. this is another personal fav. on the album.. Great Song!!<br />Track#13- Aqueous Transmission<BR>Where do I even start on this song? I put this on all the time to fall asleep to.. it's so relaxing.. It starts out with gorgeous flute playing and this really funky oriental sound.. the lyrics are so vivid.. and Brandon's voice again is excellent.. I absolutly love this song! It's a perfect ending to a wonderful album!<br />As you can see.. I'm a big fan of Incubus and of the Morning View Album.. this album definatly showcases their amazing talent!
0451147367|5.0|I didn't read Roadwork because I was itching to get into some of King's longer stuff (I wound up reading Bag of Bones and Insomnia and I am now rereading The Talisman before I move onto Black House). But the other three books more than make this book worth your time. <br />Rage and The Long Walk are fun and interesting. Quick, compelling reads that are, surprisingly enough, TIGHT. As King gets older, he seems to relax a lot more and really allow himself to roam around and explore the worlds he is creating, but these early works didn't mess around. Less than 200 pages each and they still leave the reader with vivid images and a definite sensation of having listened to a really great story.<br />The Running Man is genius, and aside from Bag of Bones it is the best King book that I have read (I still haven't read The Stand or It). I think it deserves a spot beside Fahrenheit 451 and Brave New World as a visionary Dystopia novel (it isn't quite up to 1984 or Clockwork Orange standards, but honestly, what is). And the ending informs on our current world in a provocative way that really makes one think about the world's perception of America (I won't give away the ending, but it made me understandably uncomfortable when I read it). <br />And who knows; maybe Roadwork is good too. ;)
B00005JLRR|5.0|The \\"Next Generation\\" cast of Star Trek heroes exit the franchise in their 10th and final(?) big-screen adventure. Once again, the biggest \\"nemesis\\" to Star Trek is the over-analyitical and impossible-to-please fanbase. The truth is, this is a fun and interesting film...which is all a movie audience can ask for! <br />This Star Trek film is not perfect, but is among the best of the series with a great deal of genuine emotion, action, suspense, warmth, and a worthy villian. Screenwriter John Logan has given the franchise a new feel and direction with his script. This, combined with Stuart Baird's fresh, cinematic direction, has resulted in the first \\"Next Generation\\" film that doesn't feel as if it belongs on television. <br />The film's plot involves a political coup on the Romulan homeworld. A race that had been slaves to the Romulan Empire for centuries, the Remans,  have risen up behind the prestige and leadership of a human slave-warrior named Shinzon. As it turns out, Shinzon is calling for peace and the Enterprise is sent in to open negotiations. It soon turns out that Shinzon is not what he appears to be and that the Romulan / Reman alliance is interested in anything BUT peace.<br />The plot is secondary to the warm reunion of the cast of this celebrated series. It is truly a joy to see the crew back together again. There is a warmth and comradere that comes across on the screen that is genuine and impossible to fake. As many have mentioned, there were several character scenes cut from this film (over 50 minutes apparently) that will hopefully make it back into the DVD version. The wedding scene and the scenes between Picard and Riker were particularly good. Essentially, to boil it down, the film is about family and the acceptance of personal change. This type of character interaction and the friendships of the crew have always been the greatest appeal of \\"Star Trek\\", and \\"Nemesis\\" realizes this and successfully capitalizes!<br />Another prime ingrediant to asuccessful \\"Trek\\" is great, meaningful conflict. Again, the story provides this in earnest. Shinzon turns out to be a twisted and murdering clone of Picard. The question of genetic pre-disposition versus upbringing and \\"learned behavior\\" is brought up to the fullest. In one scene (one of the best in the film) Picard confronts Shinzon, telling him that he has the potential and capability of being a better man. He pleas that he is incapable of comitting mass-murder. The beauty of it is, that somewhere behind actor Tom Hardy's eyes, you can see the brief flicker of indecision as he considers the possibilities. This outlines the other basic theme of the picture: the idea that to live is to struggle to make yourself a better person. The chemistry between Patrick Stewart and Tom Hardy's charismatic villian is electrifying.<br />The action is easily the best and most suspensful since the classic \\"Wrath of Khan\\" film. There are some fun hand-to-hand (and phaser-to-phaser) battles, a \\"Road Warrior\\" syle dune buggy sequence, and a fabulous ship-to-ship battle that leaves the viewer with the impression of two heavyweight boxers slugging it out in the 15th round, fighting with their last ounce of strength. <br />Despite what the nit-picking hardcore fans will have you believe, each character is given ample opportunity to shine. Data is, of course, the other primary along with Patrick Stewart's Picard. Riker is pivotal and has some great action stuff to do, as well as some meaningful character evolution. Getting equally good treatment is Deanna Troi, who is essential to the plot as well. Geordi and Worf have fun moments and Dr. Crusher is more prevailant than in other films, but still somewhat ignored. The idea needs to be gotten across to the fans that there simply isn't TIME to give everyone an \\"Academy Award worthy\\" role.<br />Essentially, this is an intellegent action film that raises the typical intellegent Star Trek quesions about the nature of humanity and growth. The plot is actually fairly simple, and works only to serve the emotions of the characters and the action-packed final 45 minutes. The film plays appropriate tribute to what has come before, while at the same time appearing fresh and challenging the future. Ignore the professional critics and the \\"fans\\" who have their own agenda in mind. If you want to be entertained with that old \\"Star Trek\\" magic, put your cares behind and buckle-up...because it's back in full force with \\"Nemesis\\"!
0743455967|5.0|Reading King's \\"On Writing,\\" I was reminded of Hemingway's \\"A Moveable Feast.\\" Now, there are of course obvious differences. King is a master storyteller, but Hemingway is...well...Hemingway. <br />But still, there is this thread running through them both that portrays both of them as portraits of these two men's lives as writers. King's book more specifically plays to the Wanna-Be Writer audience, but as I was reading Hemingway's book I honestly felt like Hem was talking about my world, about being a young person trying to devote themselves to Art. <br />King treats everything with candor and humor. Struggling with rejection and later drug abuse, King gives us short passages about huge parts of his life and how they affected his writing. I remember vivivdly reading how he has forgotten writing the book Cujo because of his substance abuse problem and feeling this well of sympathy rise in me. <br />The part on writing itself is good advice for writers but it isn't anything revolutionary (the piece of advice he seems to repeat more than anything else is to read Strunk and White). And King's struggles, including recovering from his famous almost-fatal car accident, expressed (usually understated) with clarity and humanity. A must-read.
B00005JLS0|3.0|Many romantic comedies today rely on being cute and somewhat romantic.  They forget the comedy part of the genre description and barely qualify as romantic.  <br />Thankfully, Two Weeks Notice, strives to be funny with it's dialog and uses the undeniable chemistry of it's lead actors Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock to create funny situation after funny situation.  The film only really gives into full fledged Pretty Woman esc romance at the end.  Which was a good choice where the film is concerned because you get to know and like the characters and you care about the outcome of their lives.  The characters are human and make mistakes, the film allows them to be funny yet real.  <br />It is an over all enjoyable film to watch, and if you must choose only one \\"romantic comedy\\" to see this holiday.  Choose Two Weeks Notice.  Though only a three on the overall movie scale, compared to other romantic comedies to come out in the last couple of years it could get 4 or even 5 stars.<br />It's a light, fun way to spend the afternoon on a cold December day.
B000002UZ1|5.0|There are, in my mind, two eras to The Beatles' career. The first was from 'Please Please Me'-'Revolver', their second era began with 'Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band' and ended with 'Let It Be'. The Blue Album collects the best of their second era, which in my opinion is the best of their work.<br />Disc One<BR>1. Strawberry Fields Forever- Off the album 'Magical Mystery Tour', and an excellent song. One of the best on here.<br />2. Penny Lane- Another one off of \\"Magical Mysery Tour'. This is a slower song, and while it's not my favorite, it's still a great song with a catchy tune.<br />3. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band- A great rock song from the album of the same name, Sgt. Peppers is one you can really dance to. <br />4. With a Little Help from my Friends- This one is in the top 3 for my fave Beatles' songs. 'A little Help from my Friends' is one of the very few Beatles songs sung by Ringo. <br />5. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds- One of their weirdest songs. Most people think it's about an acid trip when really John based it on a painting by his son. The refrain is great because you can really sing along with it.<br />6. A Day in the Life- 'A Day in the Life' is a masterpiece, this is The Beatles' best song, bar none. The lyrics, the intrumentals, everything blends together to make this epic song. Buy it for this alone.<br />7. All You Need is Love- Another favorite of mine. It has a great melody, and you just gotta sing along.<br />8. I am the Walrus- Arguably The Beatles' weirdest song. This was mainly Lennon just throwing words together, and at sometimes making them up. Great song though.<br />9. Hello, Goodbye- Great, great song, very catchy, once you hear it you'll be singing it all day. Another favorite of mine.<br />10. The Fool on the Hill- Another Beatles masterpiece. 'Fool on the Hill' has great instrumental and tells a story throughout the song.<br />11.  Magical Mystery Tour- I really have no idea what this song is about, but it's damn catchy.<br />12. Lady Madonna- Next to 'A Day in the Life', 'Lady Madonna' is my favorite Beatles song. Unlike \\"A Day in the Life', 'Lady Madonna' is a fast-paced song, that you can get up and dance to. It has awesome piano, and is just a great song in general.<br />13. Hey Jude- Listen to this song just for the finale to it, you will be singing along, I garauntee you.<br />14. Revolution- The good version. This isn't the slow \\"Shooby Doo wop\\" version from 'The White Album', this is the fast, hard rock version. Great song<br />Disc Two<BR>1. Back in the USSR- This was originally just a parody of the Beach Boys. Nothing dramatic or deep meaning, but a good fun song.<br />2. While My Guitar Gently Weeps- Harrison really should've done more, this song almost steals the show. A dramatic piece that will really move you.<br />3. Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da- I've noticed that this song gets a lot of criticism, but I don't see why. It's not to be taken too seriously. It's a light hearted song with a great tune.<br />4. Get Back- I don't have a lot to say about this song, but it's one of my favorites. It's not the best of the album, but it's still a great song.<br />5. Don't Let me Down- Another great song that I can't really describe. <br />6. The Ballad of John and Yoko- Okay, ya can't love all of em. I really don't like this song, myself. It's got a good tune, and all, but I can't stand Yoko, and John singing about their relationship is really the least of my concerns.<br />7. Old Brown Shoe- A nice, solid song. You wouldn't buy the CD for this very song, but it's still an entertaining tune.<br />8. Here Comes the Sun- A slower song by George Harrison, not my favorite by a long shot, but some love it.<br />9. Come Together- God, this song has been redone so many times it's insane. The original, by The Beatles is without a doubt the best. 'Come Together' is one of the best songs on disc 2.<br />10. Something- 'Something' is one of the best songs by The Beatles. It has a great tune,and the intrumentals are excellent. Everything about this song is amazing. <br />11. Octopus's Garden- A fun little campy song with a great tune, it's pretty kiddy, but it's still catchy.<br />12. Let it Be- Off of The Beatles last album, and one of their best songs. It's slow, and very dramatic. A powerful song.<br />13. Across the Universe- Also off 'Let it Be', and also a slow song. Very, very well done. Moving, powerful, a work of art.<br />14. The Long and Winding Road- Me, I woulda put 'The End' in place of this boring tune. Probably my least favorite.<br />So, I'm telling you, if you're even a slight Beatles fan you have to pick this up, all their best songs. The sound quality is amazing, you'd never tell that it was recorded way back when. This is the best collection you can buy, so do so.
B00000258J|5.0|If you are listening to the new blues artists today, please take the time to listen to this cd.  It has no overdubs, no slick production, and so much GUTS! And I mean GUTS!  If people could actually hear the blues stuff like this instead of that mess coming out today, blues would not be dying and younger kids would be much more interested in learning about it.

0060934913|4.0|This book is in reality a collection of articles written for various publications. They have a common theme and that is the life of a chef. The author is a talented writer with a knack for comedy. The first essay is about his life and why he became a chef. Other articles are about food production, his problems with drugs and people he has known in the industry. <br />After reading it one can never approach food and eating the same way again. You know to avoid buffets (used to recycle food that might otherwise be wasted) to eat fish on Tuesdays (the day when the fish will be absolute fresh as opposed to Monday when it will be least so) to eat during the week ( the menus are most interesting, restaurants expect less adventurous customers on weekends). <br />The book is also interesting as it is a history of eating in our society. The writer appears to be about 50. He started work in the industry when he was in collage 30 years ago and was sucked into the joy and passion of food. In talking about himself he talks about the way that restaurants and food production have changed over that time. From simple dishes 30 years ago with a bit of French and Italian Cooking to what happens today with a vast and ever changing repertoire in even the small restaurants.  This has occurred against a backdrop of more and more people enjoying eating out and trying different and more exotic things. <br />However the joy of the book is not so much what is said, it is the talent of the writer to make even dull things amusing and entertaining.  He is a natural writer and this is a book which although around 300 pates you will read at a sitting in a few hours.
0375414053|4.0|Enjoyable from start to finish.<br />Why are so many reviewers in an uproar? It's just a novel, not a manifesto on the working woman.  Incidentally, there is no \\"muffia\\" - women who are at home full-time with their kids don't begrudge or feel superior to women who work.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Well, it's been less then a week since i've had the album and already i've listened to it about 25 to 30 times.  I'm already a member of the team and frequently visit the site.  I usually don't listen to pop of any nationality.  I listen to the kind of music you'd expect skaters to listen to.  But it the week i've had it, me and ALL of my skater friends are constantly murmering the hit &quot;All the Things She Said,&quot; and none of us are getting tired of it either.  If I had to rate this album on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it a 9.2.  Not a whole 10 but pretty close.  The songs are catchy but they repeat their lines in several places.  But since they are so catch, it's not really a bothersome thing.  So, if I were you(assuming you don't have the album), i'd run out as fast as possible to ge it.  Trust me, if a skater group can listen to it, I think you could.  It's well worth it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Christina and didn't really dig &quot;Dirty&quot; when I heard it on the radio.  In fact, I almost told a Mom not to buy it for her 12 year old daughter because I thought it was inappropriate...until I listened to it.  Now, I want to tell every Mom to buy it for her daughter!  This CD is so uplifting.  Her voice is amazing and the lyrics are incredible.  Every girl needs to hear someone tell them they are beautiful, no matter what and to look inside themselves...and anyone who has been through a bad breakup can take strength from the song &quot;Fighter.&quot;  In short, WOW!
0321127420|5.0|The book is divided pretty well, the first portion of the book is a concise overview of the thinking behind most of the patterns presented later in the book, so if you don't want to read the technical details of every single pattern, the first portion of the book is a great way to get some hints as to which patterns might fit your needs. The remainder of the book focuses on the pros and cons of each approach as well as sample implementations to give you more concrete guidence on implementing the patterns (topics covered by the patterns cover a wide range of areas mostly dealing with table and object approaches for passing data, concurrency issues, and presentation layer implementations).<br />Most Enterprise developers have probably used at least few of these patterns for projects they have worked on, but it is nice to have a list of pros and cons of each pattern as well as additional alternatives that you might not have encountered or had a chance to implement.<br />This book is a must have for developers that are new to Enterprise Architecture. Advanced developers probably will not be shocked by any new / exciting revelations, but will still find the book to be a worthwhile read and a source of sound guidance.
B000077VPU|3.0|The songs that are actually on the DVD are great! I can't beleive they left off 3 songs by Guns N' Roses and Metallica! Other songs are missing too! How can they make 2 DVD discs and not have the whole concert on there? This makes no sense! I should have taped the show a long time ago! I was looking forward to watching the GNR songs! ... A lot of people are going to be disappointed, like me...

0066214122|4.0|The best of Michael Crichton's sci-fi thrillers share a simple theme:  humankind cannot control its own creations.  PREY is no exception.  This riveting, hair-raising novel concerns the melding of nanotechnology (the creation of tiny machines on a molecular level) and genetic engineering to create Crichton's latest menace to the human species: a deadly cloud of millions of self-replicating machines.<br />The narrator Jack is a stay-at-home dad who cannot find work because he was unjustly blacklisted in the computer science community.  His past work on an algorithm based on predator/prey models has earned him some fame; however, that all seems past him now as he struggles to raise his three kids.  His wife Julia, an executive in a local start-up company, does not seem to have time for them.  Lately, she has been distant and moody, not really herself.  Jack suspects that she is having an affair.  When he is given the opportunity to consult for Julia's company because his work on the program PREDPREY was used to direct the company's nanotechnology, he accepts it.  In the back of his mind, he only wants to find out the truth about his wife; what he actually finds is much more disturbing and threatening.<br />Crichton does a wonderful job with Jack's character and narration up until his arrival at the Nevada lab; afterwards, Jack could be any Crichton hero.  The formula elements are there:  the cowardly but determined-to-save-the-company executive, the children in jeopardy, the marital discord, the easily identified expendables.  Of course, Jack and his small band are cut off from society's help - no outside communication, surrounded by nothing but desert.  Jack must be resourceful with the materials and knowledge at hand to defeat the enemy.  Despite these formulaic devices, Crichton manages to keep the reader in constant suspense, with each turn of the plot as surprising and as breathtaking as the last.  This time around, he doesn't overburden the plot with lengthy treatises on scientific subjects; he demonstrates some (but not entire) restraint, adding only what is necessary *when* it is necessary.  The story is grounded in realism, with brand names and everyday chores and realistic technology, so that by the time the story takes its leap into the unfathomable, the reader is completely willing to suspend disbelief.<br />The main flaw of this novel is the cardboard characters (except for Jack, and even he goes flat.) Yes, the science isn't perfect and some plot elements are ludicrous - for example, Jack is allowed into the highly classified building of a government contractor without a security clearance - but hey, it's a good read.  This kind of book is not meant to be contemplated too carefully after it's over.  PREY is pure entertainment, no more, no less.<br />PREY is a first-rate thriller, on a par with both JURASSIC PARK and THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, both of which echo in parts of this book.  I highly recommend this book for readers of thrillers and science fiction.atises on scientific subjects; he demonstrates some (but not entire) restraint, adding only what is necessary *when* it is necessary.

B000001GQD|5.0|Richter's performance on this cd reminds me very much of Rush's 2112 album.  You are captivated from the moment you hit play, and you are taken on a journey.  But by the end, you realize that every time you will pay it another visit, you will discover a whole new world of aesthetics that you had no prior perception of.  Not just compositionally, but the same goes for what Richter's soul has to say.  It's like getting two stories in one!  This may initially sound ironic, given that his devilishly careful, almost brooding pacing, finds many listeners opting for Ashkenazy's spin.  However, for me, the more thoughtful ... a performance is, the more intricacies there are to be found.  When you listen to Rush, you barely get anything from the first listen... but you just KNOW that there IS an eternity of SOMETHING to be gathered, if you listen over and over again.  So, in either case, you become strangely obsessed and fixated, drawn to listen just one more time.  I suppose to really go out there, I will compare Richter to an artistic bag of potato chips.  You must just keep going. That's not to say you get nothing from the first listen! Indeed, those familiar with the concerto and/or Richter will be blown away, regardless.  But with every chord of the 1st movement of the Rach 2nd, you sense a world of unspoken stories, meaning, content! Warning, though - if you don't like being analytical, this isn't the recording for you.  People complain of orchestral faults, injections of political issues, etc. etc.... but what captivates me every time I listen to Richter, is how superb he is at upping the ante for the utopian combination of brains and emotion.  ...  The same is to be said for the Tchaikovsky.  Whatever stressors surround the nature of the recording, a true musician puts it all aside (OR uses it as fuel to the fire!) and performs a miracle at the piano.  If you are openminded, buy this - you won't be disappointed. Rather,... you'll become addicted.
B00001QEE8|5.0|I live in Tanzania, East Africa.  I saw this movie in Drive In Cinema some 15 years ago.  It was the night I will never forget.<BR>I remember it very much.  What the movie has, the village homes made of straw like materials, Palm Trees, Jungle Scenery, the kind of boat feature in which Baby Mowgli was found are all here in real life.  Including the moonlight scenery against background of jungle and Palm Trees.  If you watch this movie in any African country,  it will be a treasure in your memory and I keep watching this DVD over and over again.  I am also looking forward to Jungle Book 2.   Lion King is also another one which can match the specs.  Nice work. Keep it up.
B000002BQK|4.0|Finally Mariah's back on track.<BR>Divorcing was a good step.<BR>Especially for her career.<BR>This album released back in 1997 finally gives back the Mariah i was expecting.<BR>It is so multi-layered: you go from killer ballads as BUTTERFLY, the latin-flavoured MY ALL and the absolutely bautiful WHENEVER YOU CALL (all produced by Afanasieff) to nice bouncy and uptempos such as HONEY (Puff Daddy's touch heavily visible here...) and BREAKDOWN.<BR>THE ROOF is so sexy and sensual...i can't get enough of listening to it.<BR>Then she jumps in a writing partnership with Missy Elliot on BABYDOLL and finishes off by covering one of the obscure songs by Prince, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES.<BR>At the end of the day she gets the job done and quite well...<BR>Way to go lambchop!

0385334206|5.0|As successful suburbanite Dwayne Hoover steadily goes out of his mind (from natural causes) he comes to believe that he is the only self-aware being in the universe and that everyone else is a robot created to test him. He believes this because obscure sci-fi writer Kilgore Trout told him so-or so he believes-in a short story. Of course Trout was not speaking to Hoover exactly and nobody is really a robot out to test Dwayne.  None the less, without knowing it, Hoover is about to meet what he believes is his creator, Kilgore Trout, while Vonnegut himself watches from a corner table behind dark sunglasses in a tacky motel bar. And Trout will subsequently meet  Vonnegut,  his own creator,  in an alley late at night.<br />Breakfast of Champions was Vonnegut's 50th birthday present to himself, and if Cat's Cradle is at the edge of control Breakfast of Champions gleefully abandons all pretense to take a wild ride through postwar Americana with the bruised and cynical Trout unknowingly cruising headlong into the unstable Hoover at an arts festival. Along the way Vonnegut skewers absolutely everything in a rant replete with his own drawings and doodles. <br />There is a simple plot here but it's mostly a vehicle for Vonnegut. After all, there's a good reason his alter-ego Trout is the star of the show. Subtlety and shading are not strengths of this novel. A relentless and brutally observant wit are, and they play unrestrained in a sandbox as big as America and as demented as Dwayne's hallucinations.  Normally, Vonnegut is as unapologetically humane as a writer gets but leavens it with sly, observant humor. This time he's all angry cynic with no leavening.<br />This isn't humor for everyone, but for a look at yourself blackened with caustic wit it doesn't get any better or funnier. It's first rate stuff if you've got a taste for darker humor and something so unconventional that the author himself appears to the characters and not only interacts with them but messes with their heads. Maybe this should be seen with the monologues of humorists rather than as straight fiction. Either way it is an important work from one of our best authors and is very highly recommended.
0060536969|2.0|Michael Crichton has made a career out of scientific cautionary tales, some of which are significantly better than others.  Unfortunately, _Prey_ is one of those others.<br />You already know the drill, right?  A small army of sci-fi/horror works have used it by now -- including _The Thing_, more than a few episodes of _The X-Files_, the _Alien_ series, and a good half-dozen of Crichton's previous books.  A small group of scientists, trapped in a remote location and unable to summon help, must fight for their lives against a deadly new species that they don't understand -- even if they've given rise to it themselves.  As always, the good guys have to venture out of their temporary refuge on various missions, only to be stranded and picked off due to unforeseen circumstances.  As always, there's a guy who wants to protect the enemy species out of greed.  And as always, just about everyone except for Our Hero winds up dead.  (Anyone who considers any of this to be a spoiler probably doesn't get out much.)<br />Unfortunately, _Prey_ takes this time-tested formula and manages to make it singularly unconvincing.  For one thing, the good guys *aren't* unable to summon help until very late in the game.  While the full extent of the enemy's capabilities isn't immediately apparent, Our Hero has plenty of time after realizing that the team is in big trouble to find a darn phone and call in the big guns.  (If we're really supposed to believe that he doesn't do so because of company loyalty and/or a non-disclosure agreement, Crichton needed to make a much stronger case.)  Nor would the big guns find the enemy difficult to dispatch, because it's got more vulnerabilities than Achilles had heels.  In other words, humankind is never in any real danger: about the worst that's going to happen here is that a few eggheads get iced, and half of them had it coming.<br />If _Prey_ has a redeeming quality, it lies in Crichton's highlighting of the very real risks of nanotechnology research.  Yet Dean Koontz's _Midnight_ covered the same territory over a decade ago on a much wider (and much scarier) scale.<br />It's hard to deny that Crichton's work was a lot more enjoyable back when he actually had to work to sell a jillion copies.  Will he ever again write anything half as good as _The Andromeda Strain_?  Time will tell, but it's not looking likely..

0920668364|5.0|and i dont care who knows.  ive loved this book ever since i first read it.  going thru part of my life without the love of my real mother makes this book extremely difficult for me to finish without crying.  i may not have been held (ever) by my mom but when she is old i fully plan on holding her and singing this song.  whenever i am at a book store i have to read this story and always finish with a tear... a must read for all moms and dads.

B00003CXCW|5.0|Deep in the ruins of a once glamorous mansion, lurks the living ghost of Norma Desmond, the siren of the silent screen, for whom time has stopped. Left alone with her memories of Old Hollywood, she waits to make her return.  William Holden plays the down on his luck writer who stumbles into this house, haunted with the ambitions of Norma (Gloria Swanson) to make her great return (not comeback! I hate that word!) to the people she left behind.  Holden becomes the reluctant giggolo who helps her rewrite the script of &quot;Salome&quot;, Desmond's return vehicle.  The film seethes with dark secrets and the bitterness aimed at Hollywood, the great dream factory.  This is Billy Wilder's crwoning acheivement as a director.  A masterpiece that &quot; . . . should be studied frame by frame.&quot;<br />The big disappointment with this release is the lack of a widescreen edition.  The transfer to DVD has some flaws but it shouldn't stop you from enjoying the most magnificent movie ever made about Hollywood.
B000002UA0|4.0|I purchased &quot;The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn&quot; way back in 1967 when it was first released.  It was a vinyl LP, as CDs hadn't been invented yet.  Over the years, it has remained my most favorite Pink Floyd album - I have lots of intense memories associated with that tremendous, very radical (for that time), work of art. I was saddened when I learned that Barrett had been forced out.  The band took a more lucrative, commercial turn after that, and tho I still appreciate them, I like their music more when they were fledgings, SO MUCH MORE.<br />My dilemna - I wanted to replace my old scratchy vinyl with a CD.  I ordered it. EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT!  The playing order of the songs are totally different, &quot;See Emily Play&quot; is missing, and there are 3 other songs replacing it.<br />You know how you get used to hearing the songs on an album played in the same order, over and over thru the years?  This CD didn't do that for me!  I have learned that this CD was a re-mix of the original British release of the LP, and that when the LP was released in the US, &quot;See Emily Play&quot; was inserted and 3 other songs were not included.  And apparently the songs were arranged in a different order.<br />I have searched and searched, and cannot find a CD version of the original US-released LP.  And for this reason, I can give a rating of only 4 stars, and not 5.

This video is a pale copy of Broadway original. Jerome Pradon is inexpressive, slow and formally acting, comparing to Vincent. That is a very sad change. I wish they would ever make a recording of 2000 production as it was!

0440214041|5.0|This book was my first introduction to the amazing writing style of John Grisham.  His legal expertise is obvious in any of his writings and it really comes through in this particular tale.<br />Darby Shaw is the classic \\"all-American girl next door.\\"  (Fittingly depicted by Julia Roberts in the ensuing movie)  Working on a legal brief at Tulane, Shaw stumbles upon \\"the brief.\\"  <br />\\"The Brief\\" is the classic tale of power and corruption, placed, interestingly enough, in New Orleans.  After her realization that possession of the brief, or the knowledge of the contents, is a stamp to certain death, Shaw looks to escape and get her story out.<br />Her professor is killed in a tragic car bomb just minutes after Shaw left his side, and she knows she has to flee.<br />At the same time, Gray Grantham (aptly portrayed by Denzel Washington) is a DC reporter who has been alerted to \\"the brief\\" by a mysterious Garcia.<br />Eventually, Grantham and Shaw hook up, discover who Garcia was and how he was killed, and eventually uncover the mysteries of \\"the brief\\"--a web that streches to the very top of the Washington power structure.<br />In the end, good always wins, and Grisham does a great job of pulling us through this one with style, suspense, and wholesome reading.

Then, I listen to this magnificent CD, ERA 2 in an impressive flight returning to Puerto Rico deep into a lighting storm. INFANATI, HYMNE, MISERE MANI and IN FINE became magical.

This CD is for very special events........
0385470819|5.0|\\"A Time to Kill\\" is my all-time favorite work by John Grisham.  (And the movie ranks up in my all-time favorites as well)  <br />The tale is set in the deep south, where racial divides are glossed over, but are quickly brought to the surface when Carl Lee steps onto the scene.<br />Carl Lee (powerfully portrayed by Samuel L Jackson in the movie) realizes that his daughter is not going to receive justice at the hands of an all-white jury.  (Carl Lee and his daughter are African-Americans and the little girl was raped and tortured by two white men.)  When Carl Lee decides to take the law into his own hands and kills the two men enroute to their trial, all hell breaks loose.<br />Jake Brigance, a young, idealistic, white attorney is persuaded to defend Carl Lee and the courtroom drama begins.  Jake's former professor, disgraced and disbarred though he be, adds the legal expertise that is needed to an attorney still wet behind the ears.<br />The drama outside the courtroom is no less spectacular as the KKK and NAACP descend on the town.  To many, Carl Lee is a hero, but to the KKK, he is vigalante gone wild.<br />As is always true with John Grisham's works, in the end right and justice prevail, and Carl Lee is set free.<br />A great story and my favorite of Grisham's works.

I especially like her rendition of Hank Williams &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;, the title track &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; and &quot;Turn Me On.&quot;  <BR>This CD is great for relaxing in the park on a Sunday afternoon, staying in and drinking wine on a Friday Evening or for inspiration while driving down the road alone on a long road trip.  <BR>If you are thinking about purchasing this CD, do it!

B000067CPX|1.0|I cant believe that this terrible and boring album is from the guys who made an absolute masterpiece three years ago called Californication which is their best record yet. Avoid this and do yourself a favor. Buy Californication.

But the day when I put on Dream Theater's Scenes From A Memory it happened. WOW! what an amazing album. Words cant describe how awesome it is. I will only say this, If you don't own it or have not heard it go to the nearest cd store near you and get it. If you have not heard this you have not lived

Hugh Jackman did a great job and was such a gentleman you couldn't help but fall in love with him and wonder if true love really does exist. <br />This movie has everything and is about destiny, love and fate, i would recommend it to ANYONE
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Any claims that this cd is excellent despite its \\"omissions\\" clearly fails to take into account that the cd is a collection of the Beatles' number one singles, no more, no less. It's not groundbreaking to suggest that the Beatles had a greater depth to their work than is represented by a cd such as this; any Beatles fan could tell you that. To anyone who feels the need to point out this apparent flaw, in the future please refrain from making such obvious statements in your reviews. They needlessly challenge the intelligence of any amazon.com reader who is unfortunate enough to come across your review.
B000067CPX|5.0|I must say this is one of the greater CD's RHCP has done. They've added a lot to their music, and it is impossible to categorize this song. They've got upbeat songs like &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, while also adding a new sound and approach to songs like &quot;On Mercury&quot;. You can still hear the funk-rock roots they're famous for on &quot;Throw Away Your Television&quot;. You can tell they've really expanded their musical influences and have a very open-minded approach to this album. I must say, this is another great album from RHCP.

I first saw Cinema in a college literature class and I knew I had to have a copy to share with my friends and family (we're all big movie buffs).

MTV would hold MSCL marathons, and I'd spend all night watching Angela, Rayanne, Rickie, and the rest of the gang.  Even though the grunge fad was dead by the time I was in high school, everything else in MSCL was amazingly applicable to my life.<br />  Every girl at some point has a crush on a guy like Jordan Catalano-- the cool, rebellious hottie you can't help but drool over.  Every guy at some point pines for someone like Angela Chase-- someone you grew up with and now find yourself irresistably drawn to.  All of us struggle with popularity-- either we're noticed for the wrong things or else not noticed at all.  The MSCL gang dealt with friendships, parents, school, drugs, sex, and growing up in a hilarious way without being preachy or phony.<br />  People who've never seen this show may bash it as another melodramatic teen series like \\"Dawson's Creek,\\" \\"Party of Five,\\" or \\"Beverly Hills 90210,\\" but it's in a league of its own.  Yes, things can be dysfunctional at times, but MSCL wasn't plagued with an endless series of ridiculous mishaps ala Po5 and BH90210.  Yes, the actors and actresses make many witty observations about life, but they talk as teens of the time did, complete with lots of words such as \\"like\\" and \\"um;\\" they don't use tirades of five-syllable words and hyper-analyze everything to an extent that would make Rene Descartes nauseous as the \\"Dawson's Creek\\" cast members do.  This is the most realistic teen show I've ever come across; I really think everyone can personally identify with one of the characters and recognize their friends in the others.<br />  As far as the DVD set goes, it's a great set.  The pilot episode is blurry at the beginning, however, which gave me a headache.  The fuzziness cleared up in about half an hour though, and the rest of the episodes are crystal clear; perhaps it's just my copy of the first DVD though.  The subtitles of the DVDs are wonderful, and the menus are very attractive as well.  I just wish that there were some extras on the DVDs!  It would have been cool to see interviews with Claire Danes, Jared Leto, et al, or maybe some of the writers' ideas for the second season that never was.  Finally, a last quibble I have with this set is that, on certain DVD players, the subtitles come on automatically when you pop in the DVD and play the episodes.  This happened with my player upstairs, but not with the player I have downstairs.  It's not a *huge* deal, but it's one of those minor inconveniences I feel the need to gripe about.  This set is well worth the price and is a must-watch show for youth of all decades.in about half an hour though, and the rest of the episodes are crystal clear; perhaps it's just my copy of the first DVD though.

B000002N2P|5.0|Everyone who writes reviews on this album has called it Green Day's best. However, I'll always have to say that Dookie is the best Green Day album, just because it's so unforgettable. And after releasing Dookie, one of the biggest selling albums of the decade...well, they have to come out with a completely different album. Which they did.<br />1. Armatage Shanks-- Pretty darn good. A very good chorus, with the line, \\"I must insist on being a pessimist.\\" Which I would call sheer brilliance. A good way to start off the album. 7/10.<BR>2. Brat-- I don't care much for this song. It's heavy, though, with funny lyrics about a little rich brat anxious for his parents to die so he can get their money. I still always skip it though. 5/10.<BR>3. Stuck With Me-- One of my favorite Green Day songs ever. I have the lyrics written in my agenda for school. It's just so good, I can't describe it. 10/10.<BR>4. Geek Stink Breath-- Very punk and enjoyable, until you get to the chorus. The song kicks majorly, but the chorus is too poppy and kinda ruins the song. It's very hard to understand Billie Joe at times, too. Still a great song though; the bridge instrumental is the best part. 8/10.<BR>5. No Pride-- Guitar intro which leads into a pretty good song. The chorus is very good, and the lyrics cook. Good all around. 7/10.<BR>6. Bab's Uvula Who?-- Probably my least favorite song on the album. It's just too repetitive in the lyrics: every line ends in \\"all wound up.\\" The instruments are good, but I still don't like it. 4/10.<BR>7. Panic Song-- A two-minute instrumental, which is good but, obviously, boring; and then [great] music to finish it off. The lyrics are about Billie Joe and Mike's anxiety disorder and panic attacks and such. Thank God for fast-forward, or else I'd skip the whole song. 7/10.<BR>8. 86-- A great song, mostly about an old guy (probably at the age of 86) trying to be young again. It's very good. 9/10.<BR>9. Stuart and the Ave.-- Amazing bass intro into a plain amazing song. I don't think Billie Joe's voice could sound better. Love it love it love it. 10/10.<BR>10. Brain Stew-- This song is indescribable. It starts out slowly with just three guitar chords, then gradually adds in drums, and finally bass. It's pretty slow throughout, with awesome vocals and great instrument work. Damn good. 10/10.<BR>11. Jaded-- This song is bled into by Brain Stew, and is loud, crazy, and fast. What's not to love? 9/10.<BR>12. Westbound Sign-- I didn't really pay attention to this song when I first heard it, because I was eager to get to Walking Contradiction. But now as I listen to it again, I love it. You can just picture the music video (if there was one) as you listen to it, which is rare. A very good song. 10/10.<BR>13. Tight Wad Hill-- Unbelievably fast. I don't know what else to say about this song--VERY good. 10/10.<BR>14. Walking Contradiction-- Builds up to a very happy, yet cynical song. Basically full of oxymorons, power chords, and all that good stuff. Hard not to like. 9/10.<br />Insomniac is not Green Day's best, but it is still unbelievably good. Much punkier than it's predecessor and it's follower, which in many's opinion makes for a great album. I agree. No Green Day fan can truly appreciate them until they get this.
630027120X|4.0|I have recieved early news of this movie being avail. in a special edition dvd in April.  I will definatly be buying this on dvd.
0446530573|4.0|I have actually tried some of the recipes and was pleasently surprized.  The book is functional as well as entertaining.
B00006M183|5.0|Its an awesome CD and the growing pains (although not really all that bad) since Ten was worth it.  The music is genuine, speaks of pretty lofty topics in a down to earth and poetic manner.  Its' what good rock is about, it speaks to the masses but doesn't sell out.<br />This is the CD you want if you want to know what the &quot;Seattle Sound&quot; looks like when it grows up. I'm not thinking its going to sell a million albums because Pearl Jam has been beat up over their last albums (again I don't think much of it was deserved) but ten years from now, this may very well be the album people talk about when the next great turning of rock happens. Buy it.
B00005LKHW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but the unrated show basically nothing new.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Probably one of the scariest films to be released, THE FOG provides some real chills and, when the fog bank rolls in, some real terror. You won't look at a fog bank the same way again after you watch this movie.<br />The town of Antonio Bay, California is celebrating it's birthday, but something strange is happening, and just after midnight, the fog bank rolls in and some dead sailors are looking for some people to kill! And the the people can't stop this fog bank from taking it's toll, and this provides the movie with a twisted ending, as with most horror movies.<br />With some great performances from Jamie Lee Curtis, the beautiful Adrienne Barbeau, and Hal Holbrook, THE FOG is one of those movies perfect to watch alone, in the dark, and with company. After you watch this movie, you may never want to see a fog again! Superb, masterful, and greatly recommended to any horror movie fan.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This movie was good, however the repetion was a bit annoying.  But really unique concept.
B00007E8V4|1.0|this cd is horrible and they should have taken some more time to make better songs, i liked the first 2 cd's but this one really let me down.
B000005IU2|5.0|This is sooo good. it sounds a little like the stones, you also hear some free jazz (which is wild) influence, but basically this is the stooges being the stooges. There's one slow song (\\"Dirt\\"), one that's all noise (\\"L.A.Blues\\"), and 5 that are wild rock/heavy metal/punk/whatever, a sax player that mixes the wilder side of jazz with Bill Haleys's saxophonist, and great screaming, banging, and freaking out. This is so wild, you'll love it. The Hives do something like this, but this is so much darker and more emotional. The punks in the 70's never came close. AC/DC circa \\"TNT\\" was this interesting almost, but not so versatile. MC5's \\"Kick Out the Jams\\" may be a LITTLE better, but nothing else is.
630463949X|4.0|What's the difference? Well, it was recorded in a studio in front of a small audience, not in a large concert venue. Although, to be precise, any performance by a group of musicians is a concert (concerted, versus solo, effort), the performances here lack a little bit of the excitement or raw energy you expect to see in what we typically think of as a concert. But this is not completely negative, as the performances are exceptionally good, the recording quality is superb, and the (hand-picked, I'm sure) audience was well-behaved, so during beautiful quiet moments, e.g., in \\"Songbird,\\" you don't get some idiot hooting or shouting \\"I love you, Christine.\\" By the way, the reviewer below from Houston who mentions \\"obvious recorded background vocals) is wrong. There are in fact obvious background vocals, but the backing vocals were live--the singers can be seen behind Buckingham in many shots. I suspect that there was also a second guitar player at the rear of the stage somewhere but haven't checked the liner notes yet to confirm--I just got this DVD for Christmas two days ago!
B000066C6Z|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE...from the opening credits to the end, this movie is hilarious.  There are so many funny scenes...from Val Kilmer's marvelous Elvis impersonation to the underwater fight scene.  Unless you're hopelessly unable to let go and have some fun, you'll laugh your head off.  Buy and enjoy!
B00000IBVC|4.0|This is probably the most unique and most spectacular opera production of Puccini's \\"Turandot\\", plus being staged at the Forbidden City in Beijing, this also could be the most authentic \\"Turandot\\" ever produced. Zhang Yimou's stage direction has mingled large amount of Chinese traditional culture elements - Chinese martial art, Chinese dance, Peking Opera, Chinese calligraphy, dazzling Chinese ancient costumes (all hand-embroidered on silks and satins), Chinese drums, Jiaozi (Chinese sedan chair), even the young Chinese Buddhist monks played by dozens of young kids - to enrich its realism, although on the other hand, they somewhat sidetracked the essence of the story and weakened the characters. A bit of over-display by juxtaposing the Chinese tradition, one might feel, however, for Chinese culture novice, this is a very good demonstration. And again, Zhang didn't forget the moon, which seems to be his favor in any of his works.<br />The main cast, unfortunately, is hard to stand out in such a grand production and on such a huge stage, well maybe with Barbara Frittoli's Liu as an exception. She sings beautifully and wholeheartedly, and she acts. Sergej Larin has a brilliant voice, but his \\"Nessun dorma\\" lacks the intensity if compared to Pavarotti's. Turandot is portrayed by Italian soprano Ciovanna Casolla, who sings the character quite well, but hard to fit in the image of a Chinese princess. The three ministers, each of them holding a prop that's kind of confusing: a woman's handkerchief, a calabash (used as wine bottle in old China), and a Chinese abacus, are good to listen but not really nice to watch. <br />Although relatively highly priced, this DVD has loads of bonus material, including a nice quality PCM audio track of the entire production. After all, this is all about Puccini's music, and Zubin Mehta and the Orchestra &amp; Chorus of Maggio Musicale Fiorentino have made it all the more worthwhile.
0451207521|5.0|This book is the first Ken Follett novel that I have read.The plot includes a group of women who agree to go underground into Germany to destroy a key communications system.The author describes the situation in tense, terrifying prose that makes the reader feel that they are actually participating in the action.I became an instant fan of this writer.If you love a great thriller,buy this book!
B000002KZA|4.0|Merely regarded as one of the pre-Black Celebration albums I'm afraid that this album may go unnoticed to all but the die-hard fans. True enough it's not something as glorious as Black Celebration and Violator but it is intriguing how far they had come from annoying Toytown disco that was Speak & Spell ( and that was only 2 years before )<br />OK, the reprise of Everything Counts is like listening to Tetris and Pipeline does sound a bit dodgy but it's not the worst. There's Work Hard and Told You So are pretty terrible but it flows so well that all is forgiven.<br />The best song on here is the closer And Then.... which sounds like one of those possible hands in the air moments....it feels beautiful and serene and possibly almost converts you into being a Communist....but then you read back on history and then you remember that it's not so good at all. But a great song nonetheless.<br />Also Alan Wilder's lyrical contribution are also good and musically beautiful.<br />One that should be enjoyed only if you really love Depeche Mode and all it's glory. If you are new to the game it really is probably better off starting with the two Singles collections. That way you kinda know what to expect
0553381709|5.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a rare sequel that surpasses the previous books, but this does so fiercely.  One of the reasons I like this book, and the previous two, so much is that I'm often forced to stop and change my opinion about who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  The unpredictability of the story is such a refreshing surprise from the usual good vs. evil.  I highly recommend Mr. Martin and eagerly await the next installment.
0316666343|5.0|This was by far one of the best books I have ever read.  It was thought provoking on every level.
B000000XB9|5.0|My first introduction to CCR was &quot;Cosmos Factory&quot;, released in the dark ages of 1970.  What a great introduction to CCR.  Fully 7 of the 11 songs from that album are represented on this collection of greatest hits.  CCR released 7 original albums, and though &quot;Chronicle&quot; includes 20 songs from those albums, someone later decided to release a &quot;Chronicle II&quot; that included another 20 CCR songs, including two more of the &quot;Cosmos Factory&quot; songs.<br />CCR had a very unique sound, owing in part to John Fogerty's unusual, yet very listenable, voice.  CCR has been called rockabilly by some, but I prefer to see CCR as part of the diversification of rock music that led to the popularity of groups such as The Eagles.  Yes, there is some influence of what was once known as Hillbilly or bluegrass, but there is just as much influence from rock and roll and country.  There may even be a flavor of folk music.<br />Sometimes the music sounds almost like classic rock and roll, as you listen to songs such as &quot;Proud Mary&quot;.  Other times the sound is almost contemporary with the early 70s in songs like &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot;.  Other times the music seems to transcend all genres in songs like &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot;, which starts out like a hard rock song, and then reveals a country base in the harmonies and the lyrics.<br />Then there are blues-influenced songs like &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain&quot; and &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;.  &quot;Run through the jungle has influences that might remind you of Jimi Hendrix, yet blues are also evident.  The lyrics will recall images of the Viet Nam war.  Another Viet Nam war related song is &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;.<br />Occasionally CCR's lyrics create odd mixtures.  &quot;Looking Out My Backdoor&quot; has lyrics that would fit well with many of the psychedelic songs of the era, yet is played with a country-rock style.  These contradictions are part of what made CCR are great and novel group.<br />I enjoy music that creates a trend, without trying to do so.  A true artist is one who does what they want to do for themselves.  When they become successful, that is fine, but they do so on their own terms.  CCR was such a group.  This CD collects some of their better known songs, and is a great addition to any collection.  However, please keep going after you've bought this one.  You will find that there is a lot of good music left on their albums.  Enjoy!reat and novel group.<br />I enjoy music that creates a trend, without trying to do so.

B00005OWIU|4.0|John Williams delivers yet another great score to a new series of films that aim toward children. The first of these films gives us a full orchestral and choral score that contains trademark John Williams sound, with strings, woodwinds, bells, and mighty brass. Lots of the music in this soundtrack reminds me of Hook, which Williams also composed. This soundtrack was nominated for an academy award, but lost to Howard Shore's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The first two tracks are great and contain Harry's theme and the basic themes in the score in a concert like version, which Williams does in just about every score. The main themes are found mostly in &quot;Prologue&quot;, &quot;Harry's Wondrous World&quot;, &quot;The Arrival of Baby Harry&quot;, and &quot;Platform Nine-and-Three Quarters &amp; The Journey to Hogwarts&quot;. Lots of dark passages are found in the score, mainly in the second half. The track &quot;Diagon Alley and The Gringott's Vault&quot; is one of the darkest and most ominous tracks in the score. The chorus really stands out in &quot;The Gringott's Vault&quot;, as well as &quot;The Face of Valdemort&quot;. A big action cue is found in &quot;The Quidditch Match&quot;, where the orchestra performs some racing music with rapid string lines and punctuating brass. &quot;Mr. Longbottom Flies&quot; contains some brief action music, but not too much. &quot;The Chess Game&quot; contains some great snare drum and percussion work and &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; closes out the soundtrack with another big concert version of the main themes. The length of the music is at about 73 minutes worth, so there is more than enough to satisfy you. Great music and a job well done.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Cochise is classic rock, no doubt. But the rest of this album is just more mediocre, generic, alternative BS. If you dug Rage, you will NOT dig this. This is more like luke-warm Soundgarden. Chris' vocals on this are unbearingly monotonous. The rhythm section is far from driving. And it's sad to hear Morello's playing so watered down.<br />I wish I could give this effort negative stars.
0451450523|5.0|I never realized that the movie followed the book so closely.  Still, it is a great book.  Possibly the best unicorn novel written.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I am so happy to see this album at the top of Amazon.com's editors' picks.  I have bought over a hundred records this year, and this one is indisputably the most intelligent, emotional, comforting, and inspiring of the year, if not in my whole collection.<br />If a customer is disappointed and bothered by the \\"noise\\" on the album, I understand.  Don't get me wrong, I was blown away from the first listen, but I remember saying, during my first month of listening, \\"It would be better if they cut off all the noise at the beginning and ends of the songs.\\"  But now I can hardly imagine YHF without this experimentation.  You put it in, and really the time just flies by, and the once-annoying segments are essential to the experience.<br />Upon the first listen, the tracks that stuck out were the accessible ones: \\"Kamera,\\" \\"War On War,\\" \\"Jesus, etc.,\\" \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" and \\"I'm The Man Who Loves You.\\"  The catchy, poppy \\"Kamera,\\" oddly enough, has become one of the most emotionally reassuring songs in my collection; perhaps I have odd interpretation of the lyrics, but they have helped me through some tough times.  \\"Jesus, etc.\\" is the most relaxing song I have ever heard.  \\"I'm The Man Who Loves You\\" is one of the top driving songs, particularly the thrashing intro.<br />Then, upon talking to a friend whose favorite cut was the slow, somber \\"Radio Cure,\\" I decided to go back and give a new try to the tracks I didn't normally listen to, particularly \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart,\\" \\"Radio Cure,\\" \\"Poor Places,\\" and \\"Reservations.\\"  These four are now my favorite songs, along with \\"Kamera.\\"  They are simply amazing.  IATBYH makes me smirk, like I know something the rest of the world doesn't, just by listening to it.  \\"Radio Cure\\" and \\"Poor Places\\" are perfect--just perfect--for when you're sad.  \\"Reservations\\" is a love song for those of us who sometimes feel too complicated, or \\"smart,\\" for love.  \\"How can I convince you it's me I don't like/And not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes/When I've always been distant/And I've always told lies for love.\\"  Lyrically, musically, this is an artistic triumph and a soundtrack for life.<br />You should own this album, plain and simple.
0140386335|5.0|This is a great fantasy adventure that gets even better the older you are! The movies do little justice to this magical tale.
0393314804|5.0|Trainspotting is gritty, funny, tragic and beautiful.  Welsh writes the characters with a combination of empathy and objectivism, that shows us their major faults as well as what's going on deep inside(except maybe Begbie, who doesn't have much going on inside).  Welsh choosing to write how those living in the edinburgh slums talk gives the novel an added authenticity that makes the novel that much more palpable.  I'd recommend this to anyone interested in true art.
B000066NW0|2.0|Ya her songs are hits and she is popular and she has rave reviews..and it seems she is at the top of her game...BUT don't go see her in concert..my friend went and he was extremely disappointed unfortunately Avirl does NOT have much of a voice and can't sing at all live..She doesn't seem to care about her fans and thinks her new found stardom is all fun and games <br />She isn't as talented as I and others thought..It's too bad...
B00005U122|5.0|instead of the novelettes by some reviewers who insist on &quot;hipping&quot; me to their own personal knowledge of Roger Waters and Pink Floyd. But I digress, The DVD concert is wonderful, Waters band is top notch and gives an inspiring performance. If Waters can do tours like this one (and he can) who needs Gilmour's Pink Floyd. The Floyd songs cook and Waters' solo stuff is superb. 5-stars!
B000002KBH|5.0|I love this CD, it is one of my favorite, easily in the Top 10 of my collection of nearly 500.<br />I think that American Beauty is introspective and relaxing without becoming boring, which is an achievement.  To listen to it from beginning to end is like taking a journey and the payoff at the end, &quot;Truckin'&quot; is well worth the trip.<br />One song that really stands out for me is &quot;Attics of My Life&quot;.  I remember hearing this one years ago, when it first came out and thought it was interesting then, now that I am older, it means even more.  The song is church-like in it's presentation and is the pinnacle of this CD.<br />For anyone wishing to gain an introduction to the Grateful Dead, this CD is a great place to start.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Here I am 10+ years removed and I still dig this album.  There are few screams that can make the hair on the back of your neck stand up but Tom Araya delivers perhaps the most memorable ones of all time on the absolutely classic opening track \\"Angel of Death\\".  This CD changed the thrash world, opened the doors to death metal wide open. It still retains the ferocity of the original recording this many years lately.  The music is in your face, loud, and fast...nothing extremely complicated but if you wanted to peg thrash metal this album has to come to mind.  Track after track beats you into submission at times they can blend together but overall this is a must have record for metal fans.<BR>Best cuts: Angel of Death, Altar of Sacrifice, Necrophobic, Jesus Saves, Criminally Insane, Raining Blood.<br />Sure, some of the lyrics are silly in their attempt to be \\"evil\\" but the music is so compelling you rarely dwell on the lyrics. The soloing by Kerry King was and always has been just a blurting of notes, Hanneman has more style, but the chaotic jaunts of King work well here.<br />I'll say it again, this is just an absolute classic, file this with Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" and Testament's \\"Practice What You Preach\\".

0440237688|4.0|Like many other students, I was assigned to read The Giver two years ago, when I was in the seventh grade. I figured it would be like all the other stories that students are often required to read - boring, meaningless, and leaving the reader nothing but a feeling of gratefulness that the book is finally complete. However, I immediately knew that The Giver was different. Many stories, especially those assigned to students, are hard to get involved with, but I was intrigued with the Giver right from the beginning. It was almost addicting, and gripped me from the provocative beginning to the vague but suspenseful finish. Since we had only a classroom set of The Giver, we were not permitted to take a copy home, so when I went to the bookstore that weekend I sneaked a peek at the chapter to come. When my younger sister, now in seventh grade herself, was given the same assignment, I couldn't help but to take her copy away from her and read it again. Two years later, I continue to be impressed by how Lois Lowry's tone drives you to become part of Jonas' community of Sameness, helps you to experience the memories he receives, and even causes you to feel his joy, his wisdom, and his pain.
0805066691|2.0|It is sad that this work has become the most popular, certainly on college campuses, of the many histories of the conflicts between the settlers and the indians.  Dee Brown was a very talented writer and he wrote some valuable histories.  This volume, although well written, is not an accurate historical account.  Like many \\"histories\\" that appeared in the seventies it is a polemic disguised as a work of scholarship.  The book may be summarized as \\"red man good, white man bad\\".  Such a simplistic morality fable does not do justice to either the settlers or the indians who were engaged in a great struggle that deserves an accurate retelling.
B000075BFK|3.0|Pac/Makaveli is undoubtably the best emcee. Albums such as Don Killuminati, All Eyez On Me, etc... show his true talent. This album doesn't.  When I first heard that Pac had a new album I hurried up and downloaded it all, and I was very suprised that they'd want to represent Pac like this. Then after hearing Thugz Mansion (acoustic with Nas) on BET a couple times, I started to like that song, and pretty much that's the only song off of the album that at least I like...If you have 20 extra bucks and can't think of anything else to get, then get this... otherwise just download Thugz Mansion (acoustic) and go buy the Makaveli album.
B000001ES4|3.0|If you try the whole secret garden set, several times maybe, I would say most of the musics are pretty much similar.  New Age Music yes, average in my opinion, not as what I expected from the edit review...hm...not even close.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I was literally offended by the gall of Rickey Wright in his review of John Mayer and the \\"Room for Squares\\" CD. I rarely find collections of songs that I can listen to over and over again from one end to another and not grow tired of hearing. John plays a soulful guitar and sings his songs from way down inside.  I don't know his motivations, and frankly don't really care where he derives his inspirations.  All I know is that \\"Room\\" is great... I hope John can keep up the pace, and look forward to seeing him live as soon as I can.
B00005QG9J|5.0|BRANDON Boyd is a genious.  He has developed maturity while NOT allowing himself and his band to \\"sell out\\".  From the very first recordings they have had a funk beat to them.  But yet over time, maturity comes with putting aside old ways and experimenting with new sounds.  BRANDON Boyd has one of the best voices in all of rock and roll history.  This album is a mellow, melodic, and harmonious blend of BRANDON's vocals with inquisitive yet insightful lyrics.  BRANDON Boyd leads his band into the new world of one-hit wonders, boy-bands, and coporate corruption that has produced no solid, definite line of what rock and roll is now a days.  To those who believe rock is dead: Incubus leads the charge to stand up for what rock truly is.
B00006YXE4|5.0|I have been a fan of Eric Clapton for ages.  The fist time I saw him perform was with Cream at the Camden County Music Fair (I snuck under the tent, and I was in awe).  The last time was in Paris, and it was an \\"all blues\\" show- too much of a good thing, for me.<br />This CD/DVD set offers a wonderful career retrospective.  The band is awesome-lots of superstars here.  Nathan East, on guitar, has recorded, performed and co-written songs with artists like Quincy Jones, Anita Baker, Elton John, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Babyface, Al Jarreau, and David Benoit.  Nathan East co-wrote &quot; Easy Lover&quot; with Phil Collins &amp; Philip Bailey.<br />The DVD contains a track not listed here- Billy Preston's 1973 # 1 hit, \\"Will It Go `Round In Circles.\\"  What a pleasant surprise!  It is an awesome version of the song, and Billy plays the organ, sings, and dances with great style (he is 55, but you'd never guess it from the way he moves!).  Billy Preston has performed with the Beatles; he was on George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" album; he co-wrote Joe Cocker's \\"You Are So Beautiful.\\"  His keyboard work on in this CD/DVD is superb.<br />\\"Layla\\" is performed in its original version, not the mellow, funked-up version of recent years- another pleasant surprise.<br />Buy this CD/DVD to appreciate outstanding musicians; they look like they are having a blast, and the music is superb.
0375701427|4.0|This is such a great book, and yet it is so hard to read. From a purely technical standpoint it is brilliantly executed -- as are all of Roth's books -- setting up conflict after conflict, crisis afer crisis, with a complete (and refreshing) lack of real resolution. Nothing trite here. But even the most technical and literate of readers will invariably get caught up in the complex, heartbreaking pathos of this book, exploring as it does the undoing of a family that, on its surface, would seem to define the truest essence of what it means to be American. The turbulence of late 1960s America serves as both a thematic foundation and a plot accelerant, and I have to say that I feel Roth deftly captured the spirit of the times: the anger, the naivete, the mindless adherence to shallow ideals (on all sides) and the radical and painful transformation of our mercurial culture. The examination of a life being gradually and irreversibly destroyed (that of the main character, Seymour Levov), and those around him who help to destroy it (principally his daughter, Merry, but also his wife, his &quot;friends,&quot; and some mysterious secondary characters), is portrayed so expertly that I periodically had to put the book down because it was almost too much to bear. Nevertheless, this book is truly an epic piece of contemporary American literature, and absolutely deserving of the Pulitzer.
0060930187|5.0|I personally find Sylvia Plath's journals her most interesting work, but this comes in at a close second. This book will challenge just about anyone who reads it, whether you're depressed or not. If you've never been depressed in the way Esther is, you're going to ask yourself why she torments herself for no reason and perhaps feel that the storyline is implausible. the deeper you go into the book, the less sympathy you'll feel for her. If you HAVE been as depressed as Esther gets, you'll feel challenged for another reason: the book will reach TOO far into your mind and make TOO deep a connection with you because, well, Sylvia Plath describes depression very well. Her writing tends to make you feel like you and no one else are experiencing what she's going through with her, and it's pretty disturbing. However, it's also a quite rewarding experience. A &quot;bell jar&quot; is just a very apt term for a distorted view of the world that presents everything as seemingly inherently bad. Esther lives under one all the time, and she's not truly aware of it. Eventually her life is turned into a constant waking nightmare because she can't even say what's wrong with her. It's painful to read but it makes for some damn good reading. Reading this book will give you a very graphic idea of what it's like to live under a bell jar and what happens to people who live in permanent ones. You probably won't be the same after you read it.
B000006E4C|5.0|A few days ago a friend of mine and I took some mushrooms and I decided to throw this on. Holy God, what a piece of music this is. I had always loved it but I'm serious, you have to be on hallucinogens  if you even want to grasp how insanely complicated it is. My friend was hearing it for the first time but he agreed, he had never heard anything like it. Imagine being immersed inside the purely abstract images of someone's brain and you'll have a decent idea what it was like. Buy the Nonesuch recording - it's MUCH better than any other version.
B00007KMP1|5.0|A quick disclaimer: I have not heard the regular CD of this album.<br />That said, this SACD sounds absolutely *wonderful* in both its surround and stereo incarnations. This is entirely appropriate, too, for what is revealed as Beck's \\"warmest\\" album to date; it's almost unfathomable that the same guy that did Midnight Vultures is responsible to this, a pleasant harkening back to an age where artists felt free to experiment album by album. Like Mutations, Sea Change finds Beck in a more introspective mood; unlike Mutations, the approach here is positively lush, and as a breakup album it's 180 degrees from the starkness of, say, Blood on the Tracks. But the melodies are inviting, the lyrics amazing, and the musicianship unparalleled.<br />Sea Change is truly a triumph. And if you have the SACD capability, definitely invest in the upgrade version; you'll be glad you did.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When Christina first came out, I thought she was okay, with \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" and \\"What A Girl Wants\\". But then she went downhill. I grew to hate her, and groaned whenever a magazine or a person mentioned her. But when \\"Dirrty\\" got released, I loved it! It was great, so I decided to try her second album. To my complete surprise, it's brilliant! My opinion has been changed completely, I'm a Christina fan now! I still don't agree with her personality, and I don't like her fashion sense, but she has an amazing voice and great songs. Rundown of the 20 tracks on this CD:<br />1. Stripped (Intro)<br />I really like this! It may only be an intro but it's damn cool! I like the way Christina talks in it. 5/5<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down (featuring Lil Kim)<br />Very cool girl power song, with a great rap from Lil Kim. Christina sounds good on the verses and the chorus is addictive. Good first song. 5/5<br />3. Walk Away<br />My second favourite off the album. It's very long, but brilliant. I love the way Christina sings, it's very breathy and raspy. The middle 8 is full of emotion. Overall, a GREAT slow song! 5555/5<br />4. Fighter<br />My third favourite. I LOVE the music at the beginning! The cool beat, and the vocals are great too. The chorus is very catchy and upbeat. It has a good message in it, too. 555/5<br />5. Primer Amor (Interlude)<br />A pointless interlude. It's in Spanish. 2/5<br />6. Infatuation<br />Very cool Spanish sounding song. I like the verses, awesome lyrics. The chorus is amazing. Another cool upbeat song. 5/5<br />7. Loves Embrace (Interlude)<br />Another pointless interlude, even more stupid then \\"Primer Amor\\". 1/5<br />8. Loving Me 4 Me<br />My favourite song on the album. Why doesn't everyone else like it? I LOVE IT. It's so gorgeous and full of emotion. I love the cool poem at the end, and the verses. 55555555555/5<br />9. Impossible<br />The first track I've come across (not counting the interludes) that I didn't like. I don't really like AliciaKeys. If you like her, you'll love this track. It's not my kind of song. 3/5<br />10. Underappreciated<br />This has cool music, and funny lyrics like \\"I miss those days when you'd stay awake, now you roll over and snore instead\\". But this song is lacking in something. I don't quite know what it is. 3.5/5<br />11. Beautiful<br />What a gorgeous song! Another of my favourites. I love this! I love Christina's vocals and the lyrics. It has a brilliant message behind, too. 5/5<br />12. Make Over<br />This is like rock! The chorus is very heavy metal and upbeat and Christina sounds angry, it's funny! This song is cool. 4/5<br />13. Cruz<br />I would like to know why Christina named this \\"Cruz\\". This song is alright, it's a bit bland though. 3.5/5<br />14. Soar<br />I don't like this song. I've listened to it about once, and it's too long. 3/5<br />15. Get Mine Gets Yours<br />My fourth favourite. I love the beats and the vocals. It has a very naughty message behind it, and I LOVE the music at the end. Very cool! 5/5<br />16. Dirrty (featuring Redman)<br />The song that drew me to Christina. This song is upbeat, raunchy and dirrty! Hehe! The rap from Redman ruins the song though, but I love the extended beginning. 5/5<br />17. Stripped Part 2<br />This may only be 45 seconds long, but I love it! I love when Ms. Aguilera says \\"Sorry I'm not a virgin, sorry I'm not a slut\\". Go Chrissie! This has cool music. 5/5<br />The last 3 songs on the album I don't like. They're all too long for me and too slow and soppy.<br />Overall, this is an excellent album with a good mix of fast and slow songs. This album has everything and if you think you don't like Christina, this album may change your opinion. Give her a try, like I did and you may be surprised!
B0000640SB|5.0|This was one of the funniest DVDs I ever saw. Tommy Lee Jones is the very experienced agent Kay. Will Smith starts off in this movie as a NYPD officer. After chasing down a cephalopod, he gets invited with all of these other people to become a MIB. Despite being completely comedic, he gets the job and does well as the alter ego of Agent Kay (Jones).
B00005N83M|3.0|I originally gave this CD only 2 stars, but I'm jacking it up to 3, because of the fantastic songs. There is 18 songs on this CD, and only 6 are amazing. 4 of these are her singles, 2 album tracks. Ultimately, the two album tracks are also the best songs. J.Lo releases good singles, but the rest of this CD is filler. Here is a rundown of the tracks:<br />1. Love Doesn't Cost A Thing<br />I like this song - even months and months of it being overplayed, I still like it! That is weird, usually I get bored of a song after it's been on the radio for a few weeks. This is funky, with glittery, swirly music and great vocals. 5/5<br />2. I'm Real<br />Ok, what the heck is this? I HATE this version! The Murder remix is sooooooooo much better! This version [stinks]! 1/5<br />3. Play<br />I like this song too. It has a catchy chorus and you'll find yourself singing along. This is unedited version so you hear J.Lo saying \\"Play my mother f***ing song!\\" 5/5<br />4. Walking On Sunshine<br />Better then some of the other tracks on the CD, but still mediocre. This has good music. 3/5<br />5. Ain't It Funny<br />I LOVE this song! It's so much better then the Murder remix. I love the Spanish feel, the music is amazing. I love the chorus, it's so catchy I once sung it all day! One of my favourite songs on the album. 5/5<br />6. Carino<br />Don't like it - it's too dancy and upbeat for me. I'm all for upbeat songs, but this is TOO upbeat if you know what I mean. 2/5<br />7. Come Over<br />My FAVOURITE song on the album! I LOVE IT!!!! This is Jennifer at her BEST! This is very saucy with erotic lyrics, but it doesn't take away from the song. J.Lo sounds really good on this song (which is rare) and the music is AMAZING. I love the part where she says 'Fever' and it repeats itself. Don't skip this because it has sexy lyrics. A really long track (it's 4:54) but that doesn't matter! Listen to this now!! 5,000,000/5<br />8. We Gotta Talk<br />Good for the first minute or so, then goes downhill to a boring dance song. 3/5<br />9. That's Not Me<br />Another good track (the only other really good non single track apart from Come Over), that is saved from being boring by the chorus, it's sung really fast and when Jennifer says 'That's not me', the music is really fast and it sounds great. I also like the futuristic music at the beginning, then it kicks into an upbeat RnB number. 5/5<br />10. Dance With Me<br />Lol, I listened to the first 10 seconds and skipped it. 1/5<br />11. Secretly<br />Keep moving. 1/5<br />12. I'm Gonna Be Alright<br />The remix of it is so much better then this [fluff] version. This is alright though, way better then the last two tracks. 3/5<br />13. That's The Way 14. Dame (Touch Me) 15. Si Ya Se Acabo 16. Pleasure Is Mine and 17. I'm Waiting<br />I don't like any of them (that's 5 bad tracks)<br />18. I'm Real (Murder Remix)<br />I love this version! It's ten million times then the original. Ja Rule adds a funky touch to this song. This is J.Lo's best single ever, and the best song on the CD apart from Come Over and That's Not Me. 5/5<br />Favourite songs in order:<br />1. Come Over<br />2. That's Not Me<br />3. I'm Real (Murder Remix)<br />4. Ain't It Funny<br />5. Play<br />Apart from those 5 songs and Love Don't Cost A Thing, this Cd isn't worth it. But I have to admit, those 6 songs are AMAZING, and I love them! Come Over has been my favourite since I got the CD, but That's Not Me grew on me recently.<br />Apart from Come Over and That's Not Me, the singles are the best songs on here. This is her best CD out of the three she's released.  Good try, Jennifer.
B000005HN6|5.0|This was the second Opeth album I got, with Morningrise being the first.  My first impression is that this is better than Morningrise.  It has a more complete feel to it, I like the way it flows.  I may be a little vague here, but I guess what I am trying to say is that the two short instrumentals, Silhouette (a superb piano track) and Requiem (an acoustic guitar track), help the album flow better.  Every song on this album has something about it that makes you want to keep on listening.  It may be because of the way they mix acoustic and electric guitars.  It gives the music an eerie quality to it; at one point it will be strong, fierce electric guitars, but then shift down to a quieter, more soothing acoustic.  For me the best track is &quot;In Mist She Was Standing&quot; with &quot;Under the Weeping Moon&quot; coming in second.<br />If you are new to Opeth, this would be a good album to start with.  The vocals may be a little difficult to get used to, but with several listens, you'll wonder why you may have cringed before.  Listen and enjoy.
0066214122|1.0|Crappy bestselling book will make crappy blockbuster movie<br />Crichton makes a clean break from at least one of his familiar devices. Usually, Step One of a Crichton book is to ASSEMBLE A TEAM. Step Two is EXPLAIN WHY PROTAGONIST IS PART OF SAID TEAM. In this book, the team has *already* been assembled at a remote location! Straight to Step Two! Our hero needs to save the team, or fix the situation out there, or report back on what's gone wrong, or something like that. I forget. Just think Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, Lost World, Congo, etc., and you've got the idea.<br />This is a book about nanotech researchers who've never heard of, read, or contemplated the potential for nanotech disasters: \\"A flying, self-replicating, evolving swarm? Let's set it loose and see what happens!\\" These characters are operating in a vacuum; an easy narrative device that will no doubt serve Crichton well, as readers unfamiliar with nanotech themes will imagine he is raising these concerns for the first time. <br />The vacuum doesn't stop there. Crichton spends maybe a page or two describing some of the potential medical & military benefits of nanotech, without giving any sense of the enormous wealth, nor of the huge social changes such technology would foster. The researchers/businessmen in Prey manage to make molecular assemblers, but are *still* worried about surviving the next round of funding? Sorry, but whoever manages to make assemblers will abandon whatever project they're working on and start making diamonds, extracting gold from seawater, or building a space elevator - and not lose any sleep worrying about the next investor meeting.<br />If there's any doubt that this book was written with a lucrative, easy-to-digest Hollywood movie in mind, consider the meat of the central crisis. What's the protagonist's first indication that something unusual is happening? His wife is looking - especially fit. Crichton takes the most powerful, exotic technology the world's ever seenand, literally, anthropomorphizes it. No nano-mecha-fungus growing over the surface of the earth, no \\"ice9\\" solidifying the oceans. No, nothing that would stretch the imagination too far. Instead, imagine Sharon Stone's cold, dead eyes staring icily into the camera. Spooky! (Just like in Sphere!).<br />As another reviewer correctly pointed out, everything in this book is stolen from John Carpenter's 1982 movie \\"The Thing\\" - so don't be surprised if \\"Prey: The Movie\\" ends with someone saving the world with a slow-motion jump-shot to throw a grenade in some creature's maw. Crichton will add his own touch, to be sure; I bet they'll work a \\"fast-acting neuro-toxin\\" into the mix.
6305657947|5.0|\\"Create a diversion over here so over there you can steal a hundred million off the wall and waltz right out the front door. Oh, that's good!\\" And the movie is VERY good, an intriguing game of cat and mouse that will have you on the edge of your seat.<br />Pierce Brosnan hangs up his license to kill in favor of finances and adventure as Thomas Crown, a multi-millionaire who decides to steal a priceless Monet in broad daylight for the thrill of it. Enter Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), the insurance investigator hired to recover the painting. Banning tracks the Monet down to Crown, but the NYPD is hesitant to investigate -- he is one of the museum's patrons, not to mention his political connections. Without a motive, Catherine is left on her own to try to \\"get the man who has everything\\".<br />It doesn't end there, though. Against conventional wisdom, Banning and Crown fall for each other knowing that they are playing with fire - and the enemy. The deeper they become involved with each other, the tighter the game gets. And when a forgery is found in Crown's flat, things get REAL interesting as Catherine is torn between her duty as an investigator and her feelings for the quiet thrill seeker. <br />Featuring many great action shots, including the grand finale of returning the Monet, this movie will have you riveted to your seat as Brosnan and Russo battle wills and each other in the \\"Affair to remember\\".
B00007K02F|4.0|I've never read the book, but perhaps this gives me a unique perspective from which to review the movie that is different from most of the other reviewers.<br />I found the movie very captivating.  The characters are generally likeable (where they are supposed to be) and well developed, and are given depth and shading.  So the movie doesn't reflect the book - when does a movie ever do that?  It's hard to capture complex books in a (comparatively) short movie.<br />Case in point: Lord of the Rings.  I think the first two installments are excellent movies, but they don't capture every aspect of the books.  I don't know that you can even capture some things about the books in a movie.  It's just a different medium of communication.<br />I also disagree with the statement by another reviewer... \\"every trace of rebellion against gender, race, and class hierarchies is completely eliminated\\".  I think it's just subtle.  I know that Bronte makes strong use of these issues in her books, and maybe the movie isn't as in your face about it?<br />Anyhow, I think the movie is worth a chance.  And for what it's worth, it does make an excellent romance, purists notwithstanding.
B00005JG6R|4.0|My first encounter with Akira was not with the movie, but with the manga, and that seriously enhanced my understanding of the film.  So first of all, I have to say that people who have read the Akira manga are probably going to get the most out of this.  People coming to the movie first may be more than a little confused.<BR>That's not to say it's not a good movie.  Soundtrack, animation and production are all great, the plot is...interesting at least, and there are some very powerful and dramatic moments.  I would recommend this to anyone who's liked/been intrigued by the manga, and anyone who enjoys anime or dystopian sci-fi drama.  However, I would not recommend it to people who get fed up if the plot is confusing, or people who are easily offended by strong language or violence - Akira is not for kids, I'd say for 14 years and up.  <BR>This movie made a strong impact on me, and for the right person, it's a truly mind-blowing experience!
B000050XEI|4.0|I got this cd for a gift on Christmas Day.  Although I had heard of Enya, I didn't have any of her cds.  I loved this album.  My only complain is that it's too short.  My favorite songs are: Tempus Vernum, Only Time, Falling Embers, A Day without Rain and the one in celtic.  A beautiful gift to give to anyone.
0060536969|2.0|A decent opening and some good basic science are extrapolated into the most ludicrous B movie garbage that would insult the intelligence of an 'Independance Day' fan. Lack of attention to basic plotting too, for example the hero is forty years old and attended university in the late 70's yet the book is set in 2009, go figure.<br />Crichtons unique style makes it readable, but can't stop it insulting the intelligence, no doubt the basic issues need to be raised though.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Simple, sensual, soulful, seductive, and almost sinful.  Norah Jones' music and album are all of these wrapped up in one package.  After many repeat playings of this CD, I still find the music haunting and moving.  Whether it is her own music or that of others, her voice affects a mood of wanting to be with someone, preferably someone you love.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This compilation CD from one of the greatest artists to ever record is, without a doubt, one of the best CD's released this year. What's not to love?. First of all, every song on here is great, that's a given, but better than that is the fact that they all sound incredible. The sound here is about as pitch perfect as you can get. These songs, or Elvis himself, has ever sounded this good. The songs here sound so fresh and crisp, they almost could of been here recently. The real great surprise here is the JXL remix of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\". The song was originally released in the late 60's and flopped big time, peaking at only #69 in the U.S. The new remix here is such a shocking delight. It's fantastic. It is easily one of the best songs on the radio this year, if not THE best. It was a huge #1 hit in the U.K. but, sadly, didn't make a splash here on the U.S. charts. It should of. This CD pretty much confirms what we already knew. Elvis is the king. He was an impeccable singer who knew how to cut a song. He knew how to perform and to make music. Real music. If there is anybody who still remains to this very day complaining otherwise, you are a misinformed minority. This CD only confirms that. The songs here are perfect. The first eight tracks are just a breeze of perfect hits. The great up tempo rockers like \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", \\"All Shook Up\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", \\"(Let Me Be Your)Teddy Bear\\", and \\"Too Much\\" are there, as well as the ballad \\"Love Me Tender\\". The remainder of the CD ranges from great rock to beautiful balladry. My personal favorite is \\"Burning Love\\". I mean, come on, how perfect is that song?. However, the title of this CD is misleading. 30 #1 hits?. I wonder where they came up with that?. A number of songs on here weren't #1. \\"One Night\\" went to #4, \\"(Now And Then There's)A Fool Such As I\\" went to #2, \\"(Marie's The Name)His Latest Flame\\" only peaked at #26, \\"She's Not You\\" at #5, \\"Return To Sender\\" went to #2, \\"(You're The)Devil In Disguise\\" peaked at #3, \\"Crying In The Chapel\\" went to #3, \\"In The Ghetto\\" also went to #3, \\"The Wonder Of You\\" made it to #9, My favorite \\"Burning Love\\" went to #2, and \\"Way Down\\" peaked at #18. So, it's a bit of false advertising, but who cares?. The songs are all great. If the makers of this CD bent the rules like that, then they should of gone all the way and put other great songs like \\"Little Sister\\", \\"Viva Las Vegas\\", \\"Kentucky Rain\\", and \\"Rock-A-Hula Baby\\" on here. That would of made a perfect CD even more perfect. I'm really not complaining. This is the kind of CD to be cherished. To throw into the CD player on a pretty regular basis. Elvis is the king. No one will ever take that crown away.
B00004W510|5.0|After watching the Band's amazing concert documentary titled \\"The Last Waltz,\\" I just knew I had to buy one of their CD's, so I picked this one.  I heard that it was one of their best, and I strongly agree.  You would not think that four Canadians and an Arkansan, an odd group, would be so influential in defining southern rock, but to leave them out as one of the forerunners of southern rock would be a shame.  They play great music and this CD exemplifies it.  This is a definite buy and everyone should also be sure to watch \\"The Last Waltz.\\"
0393312836|5.0|This book typifies the struggling angst of the lost generations of the 50s and 60s come of age.<BR>     It does for 70s literature what Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath did for music.
B00001U0DP|5.0|When I first began watching this movie, I thought it was just too silly.  Fairly quickly though, it had me captivated, and it was indeed an awesome ending.  I had not been familiar at all with its content, as my daughter brought it for me to watch.  <br />I think it demonstrates beautifully to what depths a loving parent will go for their child.  There isn't anything we wouldn't do, and that's why this movie is so humbling.  I thought it was an amazing movie, and I highly recommend it.  Thankfully, my daughter got me a copy for my personal collection.
B00007KMP1|5.0|This Album may be different then some of the previous ones, but like always the quality and mood of the Music is 100% there. This is a great Album to kick your shoes off and relax to. You never know what's coming next with Beck and that's one of the main things that keeps me interested.
B000059PR5|5.0|The Day After is one of the scariest telefilms of the last two decades, second only to By Dawn's Early Light in terms of sheer terror.  Set in the small town of Lawrence, Kansas and directed by Star Trek writer-director Nicholas Meyer, this movie's plot deals with the most ultimate of all \\"what if?\\" questions, showing the devastating effects of an all-out nuclear war on a group of average people in small-town America and the students of a nearby university.  Although we seem to have reached an accord of some kind with the Russians in the past decade or so, The Day After continues to be a frightening film because the possibility of a nuclear conflict is still out there, if not with the Russians, then with a rogue group such as the North Koreans.  It is my hope that The Day After will continue to be lesson to all of us, so that we will work to keep the kind of catastrophe portrayed in the film from ever happening.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I've been a hardcore Star Wars fan since I first saw the original trilogy years ago. I couldn't wait when I heard George was going to write a prequel trilogy back in 1997 and when Episode I was released, my jaw hit the floor. I loved it, as well as Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Now before you start thinking I'm just a SW fan protecting George Lucas because he's my idol or something, stop thinking and keep reading. <BR>I've read reviews for movies galore and in many of them people have lost their appreciation for the reason movies are made in the first place. I'm not defending George because he is who he is or Star Wars because it's one of the greatest things since sliced bread. I'm defending movies in general. Most people will say if a movie is good or not because of acting or dialogue or something like that, but there are a few of us who really don't care about that stuff. Too many people have raised the standard on the level of escapism offered in a movie that there are only a few new films that are \\"good\\".  But, that's what movies are made for! To give us another world into which we can go and forget about everything else for an hour and a half or so. I don't care about acting or dialogue, I pay attention to where the movie takes me. I can see the little similarities between the new movies, the old, and the extended universe books and it actually seems like I'm in the movie. <BR>I guess some people are just too picky. What's happening now to movies is exactly the same thing that happened to books. So next time you start to knock a movie, think of it from my perspective and reconsider.
B00006LWSF|3.0|...What everyone should tell you about this is that all the songs with eminem are hot, lose yourself, 8 mile, even love me which is eminem rapping with 2 other rappers. There are those eminem songs, and then there are the others which are very dissapointing cuz when I saw the movie the music was mad hot then I got it and it [was a disappointment]. The songs are very conceited which is all right because alot of rap is like that, but this was just too much if you know what I'm sayin. Eminem's songs actually relate to the movie and then after him the other people come back with how great a rapper they are and how they are the king of rap. I'm usaully a fan of rappers like Jay-Z and Nas, they are usaully cool, and Jay-Z keeps it hot with 8 miles and runnin' which is okay not great. Nas, his song was just not up to his standards, you could listen to the other songs fro  only so long before you went to the next. Get it if you're a true Eminem fan like me and my family, cuz they have good eminem songs that you'll love. But it's not so good if you want a rap cd with diff. ppl. ...
4893580914|5.0|This book along with vol. 2 were the ones we used in our language school when I first  studied Japanese  for a year in  Tokyo. The textbook  shows you how to write Kanji on a step by step stroke and gives you examples too on how it can be read differently once combined with another Kanji. It emphasizes on repeatitions which will  lead you to retaining even the smallest detail of writing a character. Believe it or not, I survived and graduated from a local Japanese college with a  Kanji foundation from this book and the 2nd volume.
B00005JL78|4.0|\\"The Minority Report\\" is another example of what happens when humans try to play God. It also underscores the repeated lesson that humans are always subject to err, even when they craft the most efficient of inventions. In this case, that \\"invention\\" is Precrime, in which police officers, with the assistance of three \\"pre-cogs,\\" arrest people BEFORE they murder. This system must be working well, because D.C. has been homicide-free for six years. But is the system entirely foolproof? And can we completely trust those who are behind the controls? And how certain are we that Precrime can't be abused to set someone up as a criminal when they really haven't done anything wrong? These questions are brought to light and are addressed with varying degrees of success in this film directed by Steven Speilberg. Of course, Tom Cruise gets top billing as the cop who joined the force following a tragedy that occured six years earlier. He delivers his best work in what is really an underrated performance. Colin Farrell and the ever-trusty Max Von Sydow also hold their own impressively in their respective roles. And the special effects are thrilling, and, thankfully, are not overdone to PlayStation extremes. In its 2.5 hours, \\"The Minority Report\\" kept me interested and attentive, though Speilberg has certainly made better films. But considering the dreck that often comes in the form of shameless sequels, lame remakes, or comic book regurgitations, \\"The Minority Report\\" is a well-above average summer flick that picks at the brain just as well as it thrills. In my school of cinema, it gets a solid B.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Began hearing John Mayer with the release of \\"No such thing.\\" didn't like the song to begin with because of the fear that he'd be swept up in the \\"pop star\\" crud. Then, stumbled (literally) across the acoustic version of the song and now, i'm hooked, I absolutly love this album as my girlfriend does as well. I just wish that he'd take the tour to the midwest, such as COLUMBIA, MO!!! He's got a very big crowd here. Great album, i'd give it 10 stars if i could.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|It's good to see that among all those synthesizer- driven scores out there, there's still music that is able to catch the audience. <BR>Howard Shore created one of the most brilliant scores of the nineties. One thing that makes this soundtrack so good and appealing is the use of various choires that are not just shouting &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aahs&quot;. They're literally talking to you. <BR>It's a pity that only a few people will realise how much translation work was put into these poems the choir uses.<br />There are no words that can describe the impressive male voices of Moria, the beautiful chanting of Lothlorien and the mysterious, thrilling poem of the Ringwraiths.<BR>Unfortunately, some of the movie's best pieces are missing, like the confrontation on Weathertop. It's also a shame that the middle of the Kahzad- Dumh track was cut.<BR>This is a piece of music that had really deserved a 2- disc set.
B000069HKH|4.0|It seems like I've heard these great songs before, they are all so familiar.  I just love that about this album, though it's new, it already seems like a classic.  Great tunes, great lyrics.  Sometimes it does seem like some of the songs sound the same...but they're so good it almost doesn't matter.
0780626966|5.0|I grew up with these movies. And although they scared me when i was little, I still liked watching them! I remember avoiding meatballs for months after seeing the meatball pizza scene in A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. I hadn't seen some of these movies in a while, and I wasn't sure I should spend this much money on this collection. But I finally decided to do it, and it was worth it. This collection is awesome! Not only the movies, but the packaging is good too. The front covers on the cases have really cool pictures (different from the DVD's which are sold seperately) The original covers for Nightmares 1, 3, 4 and Fredd's Dead are included, and brand new artwork for Nightmares 2, 5, and New Nightmare. The slipcase box is cool too with 2 different freddy images on each side, and the enclosed booklet is nice as well, but maybe could have inclded more stuff. The eight disc (The Nightmare Encyclopedia) is a game-type disc where you hunt for clues and find hidden features. ...<BR>Now for the movies:<BR>\\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\"<BR>The best of the best, and still the scariest of all the movies. I really love this movie, and even though the special effects are simple, they are effective. The characters in this movie are cool, and Freddy himself is dark, mysterious and frightening (as opposed to some of the other movies) I rate this movie 10/10<BR>\\"Freddy's Revenge\\"<BR>A lot of people hate this one, but I really like it a lot, epecially after seeing it again recently for the first time in a long while. I found the homo-erotic references intriguing, and although the Jesse character isn't as strong as Nancy was in Part 1, he gives the Freddy experience a new dimension because he is scared of Freddy (as Nancy was), but Jesse is losing control while being taken over by Freddy and he doesn't know how to handle it. I rate it 8/10<BR>\\"The Dream Warriors\\"<BR>I've seen this one more than the others, not necessarily because I lik it more. I think it's the 4the bestin the series (after Pt. 1, 4, and 2) The story line is good, the characters are interesting, and they brought Nancy back! The only thing I don't like is that they killed Nancy at the end. They should have let her live and she should have been the one to kill Freddy in Fredd's Dead, not the stupid daughter. OVerall rating 7/10<BR>\\"The Dream Master\\" I Think this is the 2nd best of the series. The special effects are cool (especially the pizza and roach scenes..yuck!) The Alice character was a good addition, but I don't like the fact that they killed off the last 3 dream warriors from the last film. They should have left them out of this one, except maybe for Kristen because she was necesarry in this film in order to bring more teenagers to Freddy. But still, she should have lived, and Patricia Arquette should have reprised her role. Anyway, I think this is the most entertaining of the series. 9/10<BR>\\"The Dream Child\\" This one's more dark than the last, and kind of gives a reminiscence of the first Nightmare in terms of that darkness, but it's definitely not as good. I think this one is ok, but maybe a little boring at times. I really did like the Greta character's death, and was really disappointed to discover that the DVD collection included the R rated version so Greta's death scene was toned down (it was the best part of the uncut version! If you don't know what's going on, Freddy cut open Gret's stomach and feeds her her own guts) Anyway, the movie was a good effort with decent outcomes. Rating 7/10<BR>\\"Freedy's Dead\\"<BR>Worst of the series! Oh my gawd, this movie is so stupid. OK, it has a few entertaining and interesting moments, but Freddy is WAY to comical in this one and is just plain not scary. I understand that may have been the intention, but still. And why did his dumb daughter show up all of a suddedn?? I didn't like how freddy was killed at all, and the movie felt like it ended abruptly because they killed him, then a close up of the daughter's faceand she says \\"Freddy's dead\\". End of film. What-evah! Oh, and the 3-D sequence was stupid too. 4/10<BR>\\"New Nightmare\\" This one's good, but like a previous reviewer said, it's a bit long and you can only watch it so many times before you get sick of it. Still,it's a good film 7/10<BR>So is this worth it? YES. As a whole, it's nice to have all these movies, especially if you're as fond of them as i am <BR>So get it!
B00005QDW5|2.0|The most obvious problem with this retrospective set is made clear by the hack job done to this collection's namesake: 2 discs are just not enough to aptly represent the best of Pink Floyd. Echoes is a classic Pink Floyd song, but not the sliced and diced version presented here for people with short attention spans. On this collection it should have been called \\"Echo.\\" Chopping it up was a bad compromise made in order to fit as much as possible onto two discs. But that's just the beginning of the problems this best of collection faces. There are some really glaring omissions from this so-called  \\"Best of Pink Floyd\\" collection, like \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\" These are two of the band's best known compositions from their early days, and not including either of those immediately disqualifies this collection as being any kind of true \\"Best of Pink Floyd\\" collection. Also noticeably missing are \\"Careful with that Axe, Eugene\\" and \\"Cymbaline.\\" These are all important songs from that era of the band and should have been included as well. Other tracks that belong here are \\"Fat Old Sun,\\" \\"Free Four,\\" \\"Welcome to the Machine,\\" \\"Dogs,\\" \\"Run Like Hell\\" \\"Your Possible Pasts,\\" \\"The Final Cut\\" and \\"On The Turning Away.\\"  What makes this even more annoying are that some of the tracks included simply don't belong. While it's sort of nice to have \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" available on CD, it's a pretty boring song which should never be included on any \\"Best of Pink Floyd\\" collection. It would have been better to include it as a bonus track on the remastered \\"Final Cut\\" record. And while I like \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" it's certainly not more important than \\"Careful with that Axe, Eugene,\\" which could have been put in that place with the omission of the completely pointless segment of \\"Marooned\\" that precedes it. \\"Sorrow\\" is okay, but \\"On The Turning Away\\" is much better. \\"Hey You\\" is all right as well, but \\"Run Like Hell\\" would have been a more obvious choice for a best of collection. As for the Barrett numbers, \\"Jugband Blues\\" could have been dropped in favor of almost anything else by him, and all of them could have been replaced by the far better choice of \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\" \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" is another rough cut that takes away from its true grandeur, although the chopping job is a lot better than the awful one done to it on the Great Song Dances recording. And since that one is still in print do we really need to have \\"Sheep\\" included again, especially when most fans would name \\"Dogs\\" as their favorite from the \\"Animals\\" record?  I think Pink Floyd should pull this mess from the shelves and try again, this time making it a three disc set selling at a two disc price. And next time let the fans pick the songs. I'm sure we could do a better job than they did. After all, how can they possibly agree on which songs to include when they can't even agree on which one is Pink?  Two \\"pings\\" out of five for the mere fact that it does have some good choices, while heavily lacking in others.
B00000IGGA|4.0|'Mule Variations' was only Waits' second proper album of the 90s and definitely inferior to 1992's 'Bone Machine', but then again, so is the vast majority of any material available on the market. 'Mule Variations' is full of great songs and throws a few new sounds into the jumbled grab-bag that is Tom Waits' career, but some of it doesn't hold up as well. <br />'Big In Japan' is one of the more distinctive songs in the Waits cannon and will go down as one of his more memorable songs as will 'Come On Up To The House'. Some of the songs have an unfinished quality to them, like 'Picture In A Frame' seemed as if it could've had more to it and 'Georgia Lee' has such a familiar sound to it (the slow piano ballad). 'Get Behind The Mule' is one of the better songs off the album, but again has that &quot;familiar&quot; quality to it. Waits' lyrics are somewhat dark and odd, but have that same charm that they've always had, and his voice is still in top (ragged and rough) form, especially the finale, 'Come On Up To The House' being on of his best vocal performances of his career. The the instrumentation on the album isn't all too different, with the exception of a turntable and some vocal processing on a couple tracks. Some may find this familiarity as a blessing, and others may find it as a curse. It turns out 'Mule Variations' is a little bit of both.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|Ron Howard takes an inspiring story and, true to form, reduces it to its most saccharine components. Consequently, this movie is virtually indistinguishable from Howard's other work. <br />The movie chronicles the life and trials of John Nash, a prodigious mathematical talent and eventual winner of the Nobel Prize. Nash matriculates as a doctorate candidate at Princeton in 1947, where he stagnates academically until he discovers his &quot;truly unique idea&quot;; that single accomplishment that distinguishes him from what he perceives to be the majority humanity: great pretenders. <br />However, the real focus of the story is not Nash's brilliant mind-or even the Herculean accomplishment related to his economic, theoretical masterpiece-it is Howard's unswerving focus on Nash's illness: schizophrenia. Regardless of anything else that Nash accomplished in his long life, academic or otherwise, Howard's only focus is on the one thing Nash could not control. I find this to be disingenuous at best and sinister at worst. <br />Howard's unwillingness to focus on the things which Nash had the ability to control speaks volumes about his directorial agenda. Indeed, by his own admission, Howard chose to focus on the &quot;love story&quot; in Nash's life. While the love for his loyal and long-suffering wife is certainly a strong credit to the man, it is hardly his only noteworthy accomplishment, and Howard's singular focus makes this a merely mediocre film that could have been a real triumph of (and tribute to) the human mind. Indeed, the director seems unwilling to focus on any of the uplifting components of the Nash biography (with the possible exception of Nash's richly deserved public recognition) precisely so that he can dwell in the morass of Nash's mental illness; this ought to frighten moviegoers seeking to identify and glorify the best within mankind. <br />Russell Crowe plays the eccentric (and later schizophrenic) character very well, and his talent as an actor is tobe admired for its sheer intensity, if nothing else. The viewer empathizes with Nash precisely because Crowe makes him so real to us. Likewise, the quality and character of the supporting roles from Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris are tremendously impressive. <br />However, the greatest failing of this film is to focus on the most metaphysically unimportant thing in Nash's life (a mental illness) at the expense of the great heights he climbed in spite of his circumstances. Howard could have chosen to focus on any number of Nash's attributes, but instead he settled for the one thing that was beyond his control. <br />Had Howard focused on the brilliance of the economic theory, we would have had a hero's tale. Had he focused on the fact that Nash recovered from schizophrenia virtually without medication, on the strength of his own indomitable mind, we would have had an uplifting story about triumph over adversity. However, Howard focuses only on the base, the unimportant, and ultimately this is why the film properly fails; because it does not stray from the standard Hollywood formula of a silly ending, it falls victim to its own vacuity.
6302038308|5.0|Okay...to clear it up.  \\"Evil Dead 2\\" is a SEQUEL...not a remake.  The first part of the film is a recap to get you up to speed on what happened in the first movie.  The story is simplified (this time only Ash and Linda go to the cabin...no sister, no other friends) in order to fit the constraints of a quick recap without losing the audience.  And it works just fine.  I wonder why no one ever mentions that the exact same thing happens at the beginning of \\"Army of Darkness\\" when it recaps both of the previous movies.  Also, it's odd that people think this is a different Linda.  Sure, it's a different actress...but who cares?  I mean, Bridget Fonda played the same part in \\"AoD\\"...so what?  Oh well, no matter.  What matters is that this is a sequel, even if it does have a slight case of amnesia when it comes to certain facts portrayed in the first movie.<br />Now, with that out of the way...time for the actual review.  I'd say that this is the best entry in the series, without doubt.  Hilarious, surreal, and very violent, it's exactly what a horror-comedy should be.  My only problem with it is the green slime that spurts out of dismembered demons.  I much preferred the sickeningly realistic blood in the first \\"Evil Dead\\" movie.  I guess that this time around, Sam was looking to get an R-rating...so he figured that too much SLIME wouldn't get him an \\"X\\"...which, at the time, was still a rating...and one that an overenormity of blood could land a feature film.  This was, after all, still in the days before the \\"NC-17\\" rating.<br />So, slime instead of blood...my only complaint.  Though there is still a great deal of blood in this movie...particularly when Ash removes his right hand with a chainsaw.  This is one of many incredible sights that you'll be treated to when watching \\"Evil Dead 2\\"...check it out.  It's one of the few horror flicks out there that get the full 5-star rating from me.  \\"Evil Dead 2\\" is indespensible, and a truly unique film.  You'll never see anything else quite like it.

B00006SFLV|5.0|Well, all I can say is that watching this show on DVD was even better than when I first saw it on TV. I don't think that I actually appreciated the shows sincerity on issues that every young person has to deal with in high school or in everyday life. It took me two days to finish watching each episode and oh my I felt like I was fifteen again! To remember what my first love felt like, the pain and agony of losing friends, the incredible battle between loving and hating your parents, and the neverending search for your true self. This shows has all that and more. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who has or is going through adolescence. It's a show that was ahead of its time but that has become a classic in the eyes of those who were privileged to see it. The only problem is you are left wanting more... to find out what happens....but in some way you can figure it out on your own. I mean we were all there once ourselves. All I can finish with is...WATCH IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!
B00004CWO8|1.0|The music is wonderful, the sound quality on the surrond sound is <BR>great, but... The new \\"modern\\" version of this beautiful ballet<BR>is just plain crud! <br />If you like the music, buy it. <BR>If you like ballet, stay away!!!<br />That funny whirring sound when you watch this is Tchaikovsky<BR>spinning in his grave!
B00005RZV4|5.0|I was at the Lakeland, FL show in 2000, my first NIN concert after many years of waiting.  The concert was an unbelievable experience that really carries over into this CD.  NIN live, at least in my opinion, is almost a wholly different animal than the studio NIN.  This CD is full of raw energy spiced nicely with anger--the kind of rush the live show provided.  And Trent Reznor, well, isn't he just the cutest little bundle of anger you've ever seen?
B00005JKNB|4.0|When I think of Jim Carrey, I think of someone bending over and talking out of his butt.  Unfortunate, but true.  However, \\"The Majestic\\" should finally shake that image out of people's minds if they give the underrated film a chance.  This is simply a majestic film - from the period feel and the directing, to the standout performances, including Martin Landau, who *should* have been nominated for an Academy Award.<br />Carrey is well cast as the anonymous Everyman who wanders into the right place at the right time, and it saves his life.  He is sweet and good hearted, and even in the \\"frame tale\\" that begins and ends this film, he doesn't fit into the typical Hollywood mold precisely.  Unrealistic?  Perhaps...but so what?  I personally welcome a movie that hearkens back to the simpler times and values of the postwar era once in a while.<br />People who should buy this film include fans of the director (\\"Shawshank\\" and \\"Green Mile\\"), fans of Carrey, fans of romantic simple films, and fans of McCarthy era period pieces.  This is a film that many generations can enjoy together.
B000002TQV|4.0|Radiohead is often associated with much hype and hysteria. Releases since OK Computer have been declared masterpieces by many. I personaly have many reservations to those claims. While their debut album was grunge, \\"The Bends\\" was the last Radiohead release prior to their avante-gard stage and is probably their most digestable release to date. What you have is a solid rock / pop CD with some U2 influences. Songwriting is strong as are tracks like: the bends, fake plastic trees, high and dry, bullet proof, nice dream, street spirit are very good. There is much less wandering here than on later discs and Thom Yorkes vocals are much clearer. If you are new to Radiohead or just want some good alternative rock-pop music then look no further.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Fun movie!  Everyone in my family loves it. It sounds great with surround sound also.  When the monster sneezes and flames burst out it sounds SO real you think you'll get burned!  Billy Crystal is funny as always and BOO is ADORABLE!  Get this one!
B000002H97|2.0|This is a the album that caused quite a stir amongst the bands fanbase. Chants of  \\"sellout\\" were heard all over the place. So this album is different than previous ones and thats the typical response to anything that is different.<br />Is different for better or worse ?<br />The album is very well produced, the bass is fully heard, the drums a very loud and James still roars. But thats about it for the compliments. Songs are now in verse-chorus format, the lyrics are different - no more controversial issues. This could have worked but the songwriting is the real downer on this album. \\"Thin\\" is what comes to mind. The songs no longer make an impression like on previous albums. Its almost like the band wants to write killer tracks but know that the only way they will reach MTV and radio is by blanding them out. Still there are some good tracks like \\"unforgiven\\" and \\"struggle within\\", the rest are harmless and some like \\"enter sadman\\" are laughable - \\"exit light enter night, hush little baby?\\" come on!!!<br />Local radio stations in Sydney whom never mentioned them before started to jokingly make bon jovi comparisons. This is just sad.<br />I think Metallica could have done a good hard rock format album that was a little less mainstream. They could have evolved musicaly and still maintained a lower profile and a lot of respect. However, It is clear to see what they were striving for and they got it.
0553260111|3.0|This is the first Ludlum book I have read and I'm debating whether or not to continue with the other &quot;Bourne&quot; books.  The Bourne Identiy had plenty of page turning action and the plot was solid.  Ludlum does a fair job developing Bourne's character, but Marie's character is weak and not at all believable.  The story is also so outrageous that at times it is difficult to follow.
B00005JLF5|5.0|In my opinion DS9 became the finest of the Star Trek series to date.  I love TOS, and TNG but the fine episodes like Duet, Way of the Warrior, The Vistor set this series apart.  Out of a rough beginning came 7 seasons of great story telling and character development.  DS9 was the high water mark of Star Trek and Voyager was Star Trek's greatest failure.  The first season sets the Cardassian/Bajor, Dukat/Sisko, Prophets storylines in motion.  The series and the actors struggled to find themselves but when they did, in season 3, DS9 became very entertaining.
B000063UR2|3.0|This is a warning!<BR>The DVD cases tend to have a &quot;mold line&quot; right where you put the american release disk. This will scratch your disc and cause serious problems.<BR>This may be fixed on newer releases, I don'd know.<BR>It can be fixed by removing the molding line with some fine grit sand paper, but your disk may already be scratched when you get it.<BR>I know of several people who have had this problem, and several who have not.<BR>At any rate, HANDLE WITH CARE until you have had a chance to inspect your case.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Hmmmm. Maybe I set my expectations too high for this album. I was expecting big things from these guys, groundbreaking things, revolutionary things. Alas, it was not to be. Chris Cornell writes and sings a bunch of songs that sound exactly like the songs he wrote and sung on Soundgarden's last two albums. Tom Morello creates an array of weird guitar sounds that sound exactly like the weird guitar sounds he produced on Rage's last album. And Tim and Brad play at the same mid-paced, workmanlike tempo they've been playing at on every Rage album. <br />Get the picture? There is nothing new here. It's not that Audioslave is bad, exactly. The CD is decent, it sounds very good played at high volume in my car stereo. It's just that none of the tracks stand out. Nothing I hear on this CD sticks in my head after the disc is done playing, demanding me to listen to it again. And it's not like I just bought it, either; I've had it for over a month, and have played it numerous times, hoping something will click. No luck.<br />Maybe they'll get better. After all, this is only their first album. Maybe the egos will relax enough for them to loosen up and try new things next time. Maybe their next CD will redefine the very concept of what a rock and roll album can be. But this one sure isn't going to.<br />Oh well, at least the existence of Audioslave is distracting Chris Cornell from putting out any more godawful &quot;sensitive singer-songwriter&quot; solo albums. For that fact if for no other, I'm glad this band is around.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Even though I am a Christina fan I thought that this album wasn't going to be good. Because I thought it took to long to come out, plus they kept pushing the date back. When my mother bought it for me for Christmas I hesitated to open it because I thought I wouldn't like it. But when I listened to it the night after Christmas I loved it. I think this is better than the first album. It's too bad that it heartache and pain in a relationship for the album to be this good. Some of the songs really hit home with me, I could relate to alot of them. My favorites are &quot;Can't hold us down, Fighter, Infauation, Impossible,Get mines get yours, Dirrty, I'm Okay, and The voice within.&quot; I defintely recommend this album to anyone, even if they didn't buy the first album.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Love this movie's music?  You will Love this cd!! Get it!! :0)<BR>Don't bother with vol. 2
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Oh man! This special edition is truly a great Magic!<BR>I loved the movie from the first time a saw it (a few years ago), and then when I saw the musical in London.<BR>But this is just amazing! And the Extras are just great!<BR>Love the song Human again, was so right to put it in the musical, and then in the movie!<BR>Great Movie! Great Edition! If you are Disney's fan, this is one to own for life!
B00007BH5C|5.0|I first got this CD on Christmas Day as a gift and immediatly started to listen to it. The new Rohan Theme is very nice, catching into the culture of the Men. However, the score does not level up with Shore's score for the first Lord of the Rings movie. There isn't any epic-like sounding track unlike the first ones The Bridge of Khazad-Dum, A Knife in the Dark, or Amon Hen. Probably the closest one should be Forth Eorlingas and The Uruk-Hai. The track Evenstar is a very nice addition and vocalist Isabel... something, fits very well into it. Also a good track is Samwise the Brave. It sounds a bit like The Breaking of the Fellowship from the first one but adds a little twist to it.<BR>Overall, I believe that the score for The Two Towers is really good except for the fact that it doesn't sound epic enough and that Shore uses a little too much brooding music. I am not a big fan of slow brooding music so I suggest to Shore that the final score for The Return of the King, should sound a bit more like The Fellowship of the Ring. Song performer... maybe Charlotte Church could be a good one...
B00005JKZT|3.0|Two Towers is much more than the empty CGI mess of the new Star Wars films, but it is nevertheless not the masterpiece that some people are claiming. The film is lavish and has nice moments; but there is a distinct lack of movement and structure to it that causes it to not quite work. <br />Specifically, the three major storylines never mesh or balance with each other. The two minor hobbits have nothing to do, and are extraneous characters. There is a general shapelessness to the film that makes it a confusing experience.<BR>This shapelessness is due to the devotion to the storyline of the original book. This is a brave and foolish choice. <br />...<br />The acting and cinematography are often heavy-handed, boring and melodramatic. Do we really need to see so many sweeping shots of the countryside? And do the actors have to speak-so-slowly? As if this is The Ten Commandments. When Gimli jokes about Dwarvish women, the tone of the film is improved a lot. The film is taken too seriously: no whismicality or spontaneity (sp?) to speak of. Same flaw was in FOTR.<br />Enough has been said of the changes to the storyline that actually negate the story in the book. Specifically, the fact that we never know that the reason why Saruman had the minor hobbits captured is because they are thought to have the Ring. Saruman's rebellion against Sauron is never even alluded to! Frodo shows the ring to the Nazgul, thereby negating all the action of the War of the Ring, and also negating the surprise that the hobbits are supposed to have caused Sauron. <br />One final negative: some characters are corny. The voices of Gollum, the Orcs and the Ents are very corny. They sound like some cheap Saturday morning cartoon characters, as well as being nearly impossible to comprehend.  <br />Now for the positives.<BR>One: The film avoids many of the pitfalls of the preceding film. The static action scenes of the second half of FOTR ruined it for me; TT totally avoids that pitfall. The action scenes seem nicely paced, and actually have effect on the storyline! One action scene was invented for the film: the fight with the Warg-riders. However, this happened in The Hobbit; and besides, the sequence is very nicely done.<br />Two: the grittiness of the atmosphere improves the appearance of the film. Despite an excess of sweeping shots, mentioned earlier, the griminess of the surroundings makes the film more interesting that the continuous goldenness/cleanness of FOTR.<BR>Speaking of which, the props and sets are still *too complicated*! A little less curlicue and a little more simplicity would be easier on the eye. However, that's more of a subjective point.<br />Three: Gollum still has some of the usual flaws of an animated character - i.e., the animators never seem to make him stay still, he has a silly voice. However, he is an interesting character, and the CGI does look as good as people say.<br />Four: the battle scenes are as impressive as people say, especially the various siege devices. Saruman is depicted as using gunpowder, which fits in with his love of machines and explosions!<BR> One minor point though: The orcs form up in very deep blocks-formations. No army in the world would form up in such deep formations. It makes the frontage of an army narrower, while getting no benefit from the rear ranks. This opens up the force to outflanking maneuvers, as well as being vulnerable to a collapse in the forward ranks. Ancient and mediaeval infantry would form up, on average, eight men deep. Yes, I know this is fantasy...<br />Overall, TT is not quite as good as people seem to think. It's incoherent and sometimes corny and melodramatic. But it is still an entertaining film; it \\"works\\" in that sense, I suppose.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This cd is awesome, I listen to it constantly and I love it! I recently became interested in this kind of music and I was hooked when I bought the strokes cd. When you hear that the strokes, the vines, and the hives all sound exactly the same, you are hearing very wrong. If you really listen to them open mindedly, you'll see that they all have very different styles. My favorite right now are the strokes. Who cares if they arent incredibly recognized by the music industry? Thats not the point. It doesnt matter if their style is somewhat like the other bands out there, its just about the music. So dont buy into all this 'they're fake' [stuff], listen to them and see for yourself.
B00005JKZT|1.0|When the movie finished after almost three hours I was sorry it ended...Spectacular movie! I just wanna thanks Mr. Peter Jackson.<br />The cast is marvellous, everything is top of the game. But just don´t expect it to be so faithful an adaptation as the first film was. He centered around Aragorn.<br />...<br />Also, I´d like to know, adding the totals from the first and second movies, how many creatures have Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli already killed. I think it may be a new world record for movies...<br />GOLLUM is the treasure here. Simply perfect. <br />All in all, Peter Jackson is giving a lesson to George Lucas of how to use special effects in pro of the history and, AT THE SAME TIME, to develop great characters and obtain great performances from his actors...
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is an absolutely gorgeous film and it's easy to understand why it's so popular in Japan. But it's important to remember that it's _not_ a Disney film and therefore will not have a neatly resolved tidy ending. There are scenes that may make kids a bit squeamish, so be forewarned.<br />But it's a lovely film, well crafted and tells an amazing story. If you like animation, you definitely have to see this film. The story is compelling, the animation is great and the voice actors do a terrific job. Watch it for yourself and find out how good animation can be.
B0000027DJ|5.0|Received this one ...after listening to a downloaded version of the title track.  I have to say, though I liked Hey Stoopid, It ranks about 5th on the list for favorites on this album.  Wind Up Toy definitly reminds me of the album \\"Goes to Hell\\", while Hurricane Years is along the Trash/Constrictor lines.  I truely like every Alice Album I have ever heard or owned, including \\"flush the fashion\\", but this one is among the top three now.  ....<br />Great Album, would be bargin at twice the price!...
0312243022|4.0|\\"The Hours\\" shows even more than \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" does how very, very precious life is, and contrasts so well the ordinariness of life against its most precious, exquisite moments, those moments that we hold on to. A beautiful and highly recommended read. Don't give up before the end; don't get lulled by what may seem to be predictable and quaint. Cunningham provides a very, very powerful ending to his masterful reworking of \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"
B000065V41|4.0|It's a great movie because anyone can watch and enjoy the Muppet's humor anytime in the year. It would be nice if they made a widescreen version though.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I am one of the biggest Michael Jackson fans ever! He is the best and will be remembered for his sucess 4 eva! Thriller is definitely THE BEST album ever! Take my word for it.I listen to Thriller every single day. It must be  on everybody's music list. Without Michael, there would be no good music. Music would be just blah! No matter what the media says, he is the King of every type of music! I've been a Michael Jackson fan since I was 2 and I will forever be his fan! I'm still trying to do the moonwalk without breaking my toes, but I'm getting there!<BR>Michael Jackson 4 EVA!
B000024KBZ|5.0|I have been a major D2 fan since I can remember and I am only 20 so it can't be too much of a memory, so you can imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon Big Thing in a record store discount bin. I have heard only a few scattered things about the album and they had pretty much escaped my memory, so I decided to buy it simply out of curiousity and loyalty to D2. <BR>  Well at first listen I wasn't really into the sound. But as time wore on I really began to see it as hidden treasure. The first side has it's moments of greatness (\\"Drug..\\" \\"Too Late Marlene\\" and \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\"). But the second side, a much more moodier melodic sound, is my fav. \\"Do You Belive in Shame\\" is a gorgeous song and \\"Palomino\\" is a hauntingly dark tune with an almost ethereal melody but my all time fav. on the cd has to be \\"Land\\". It's a beautiful song, in my opinion, with lovely lyrics and an even lovlier sound. <BR>So if your'e a diehard Duranie then this is steal but if your'e not then it might be worth your'e while to pick it up and see.
B00007JMCX|5.0|if you haven't bought the original dvd of the man who fell to earth, the wait two months and get this one instead. it's been digitally remastered and includes (according to anchor bay)... <br />The Man Who Fell To Earth - Feature Presentation (Disc One)<BR>* Widescreen Presentation enhanced for 16x9 TVs <BR>* THX Approved <BR> <BR> The Man Who Fell To Earth - Bonus Materials (Disc Two)<BR>* Theatrical Trailer <BR>* TV Spots <BR>* Talent Bios <BR>* Poster And Still Gallery <BR>* Watching The Alien -- An All-New 24 minute featurette <BR>* Original Screenplay in DVD-ROM <BR> <BR>i'm defintely waiting to get my hands on this.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Funny, smart, and clever.  A must see for all intelligent viewers.
B000002UAU|3.0|To me this is when The Beatles ceased to be a band. Both this and Magical Mystery Tour are their two worst records,especially after the brilliance of Rubber Soul and Revolver, which had a good mix of their &quot;band&quot; sound and studio experimentalism. Pepper goes overboard with orchestration to the point where it sounds like some guys just singing with the orchestra ,rather than a rock band being accompanied by one. The songs from this period are better heard on the Beatles Anthology, where you get the demos minus the orchestra,you really appreciate the material for what it is and what Pepper could have been. Sorry guys I think Mick and Keith got the upper hand in the Brit battle at this point, at least they kept it real as a live group.
B00002EPJH|5.0|This is a very beautiful album that my wife and I enjoy playing over and over again.
B00005A46T|1.0|Finally, reality has caught up with me. I bought this album the day it came out, early morning when the store opened on Aug. 28, 2001. I was in awe after their first album and just had to have more, so I bought Iowa with high hopes. At first, it was great. It was heavy, yet sometimes melodic, filled with profanity and anthemic nu-metal songs just begging to be replayed. Then, it started to wear out. By mid-September, I was already bored, and their s/t debut was looking a lot better. I gave it a four-star review on Amazon. It's buried back there somewhere...<br />However, I give it one star now after a year and a half of owning it. I can't remember the last time I listened to it. It's really a shame. See, all those 'extreem metal duuuuudes' on here openly trashing Slipknot had a point. <BR>The world isn't THAT bad. <BR>The music isn't that heavy. <BR>\\"Left Behind\\" IS startlingly mainstream. <BR>There is little melody here.<br />All the extreme metal that they recommended I passed off as talentless death metal garbage. Nuh-uh. Not all of it. Bands like Opeth, Sepultura, In Flames, Dillinger Escape Plan, Atreyu, Killswitch Engage, Soilwork, Hypocrisy, Dissection, Emperor, White Zombie, Gardenian, and the rest are all real metal. They employ melody and technicality and enough doses of aggression to keep one busy for a long time. I know. I've been listening to Sepultura's Chaos A.D. for that year and a half since Iowa came out. It's worth it. Iowa isn't.<br />In trying to impress their fans, Slipknot lost them. They tried to become something they weren't. They wanted to reach the heights of Slayer and Cannibal Corpse(who knows why), and couldn't do it. Corey gave up his ability to rap(which he could quite well compared to many that try) and sacrificed melody for noise. Their lyrics went down the toilet, and many of the band members no longer play at all. They could practically reduce their number from 9 to 4 members if Corey learned to play a guitar. Then again, they don't even need the extra guitar, because the songs are pretty simple, and no leads or similar guitar work is present. The epic track \\"Iowa\\" is a 15-minute dirge that goes absolutely nowhere. Dream Theater can play a 42-minute song that feels like 5 minutes, but these guys can't. They tried and failed. I would probably be able to squeeze out three or four stars for their s/t, but Iowa gets one star, because that's what it's really worth. Sorry, but that's the truth.<br />By the way, Mudvayne's LD50 still receives play in my player. It's a far superior album if you like this sort of thing. Their new one is just as good, if not better. Lots of melody. Also try Stone Sour. Corey should leave Slipknot and join them permanently. No gay masks. Solos. That's better music.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones is almost exactly what the record industry needs right now. In 2002, packaging and labeling were king. You needed the rough yet friendly image of Justin Timberlake, the unwavering poppish appeal of Avril Lavigne and upbeat overproduced singalongs that were fun to blast on your car stereo. How, then, can we explain Norah Jones' success?<br />   Right when we need it, Norah gives us something new - maybe not groundbreaking, but new enough to make us turn our heads and listen. Is it jazz, is it pop, is it...what is it? Honestly, I'm not sure how to descrbe it but to say that it combines the improv and accousticism of jazz, the melodic sense of radio pop and the deep emotion of the blues. The kind of CD you could spin on easy listening, jazz, or pop radio.<br />   Normally, this would be a five star combination - there's one problem. While she grabbed these different elements to put in her music, she forgot to snag a foundation. Some artists, like Dave Matthews for instance, can pull off a unique sound that borrows from different genres but is well fitting. Norah can't. The jazzy parts are good (although no solo is over 45 seconds), the pop parts are great (but even the best of it, \\"Come Away With Me\\" is just TOO stripped down) and the bluesy feel worked (but even the teasing \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" may have been a little too restrained). So, while the musicianship, songwriting, production and emotion of this record were good IN THEMSELVES, when put together, it sounded like a house with no floor. Worth the money, but expect better things from her next album!
B000069AUI|4.0|Once again Coldplay has done it! After listening &quot;Yellow&quot;, I've always been waiting for new stuff from these guys and they have never disappointed. If you are a coldplay fan, buy this without thinking; if not, and you don't mind listening to alternative stuff, this is your time.<BR>Although &quot;Clocks&quot; is undoubtedly the reason for spending money on this album, now I think I could have bought this one for almost any track on this CD.<BR>Go Coldplay!
0920668364|1.0|There are problems in the text and problems in the drawings.  The cover shows a child who has messed up the bathroom with toilet paper.  Other pictures show the child having done other naughty things... but the mother loves her child and always sings him her little song...<br />\\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, my Baby you'll be.\\"<br />He gets big and doesn't want her rocking and singing to him so she sneaks into his room at night and does it anyway, and when he's a man and lives across town, she drives over with a ladder and climbs in a window and rocks and sings to him.<br />Then she gets too old to do these things and he takes over the rocking and singing, changing the lyric to:<br />\\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, my Mommy you'll be.\\"<br />What's wrong with the text?  Does love stay the same during the period of sixty years?  Do we intrude on the privacy of adult children? Doest the function stay the same? <br />Now, before folks defend...  I bought this book in two seconds.  It spoke to my need for unconditional love and for my children to stay true to me.  (See the reviews that come before this one.) But I never actually read it to a child, because I felt some restraint about it, and later I learned what I've written here from a wonderful teacher of children's lit.  The book has a hook, I fell for the hook, I expect you did too (it's a huge bestseller). It helped me that I had the opportunity to rethink this, but it was painful to do so. Give it to adults, if you must, but not to little children who are forming their images of what love is... since they must learn that love changes and grows, if it is to endure.
B0000630BT|5.0|I was always a JP fan but skeptical when buying Painkiller because I had never heard a song on it. Turns out Painkiller is my fav cd in my collection. After a fairly odd return to true metal with Ram It Down,Painkiller is a masterpiece. Rob's vocals are beyond amazing matched with the six-string fury of K.K. and Glenn as well as the new drummer Scott who makes Painkiller even more exciting with his natural talent for metal. If you like JP this is a must-own album. There is no track you skip over when listning to this cd. This is in my opinion the best metal album to ever be recorded.
0887306667|5.0|This is a great book. Al Ries and Jack Trout have done it again. These are the laws of Marketing - Immutable laws to say the least. I really enjoyed reading this, and highlighting the most important parts that I could use or gain something from. I would like to introduce you to 4 laws that were described, that I found quite interesting.<br />The Law of Mind (Law 3)\\"Thousands of would-be entrepreneurs are tripped up every year by this law. Someone has an idea or concept he or she will revolutionize an industry, as well it may. The problem is getting the idea or concept into a prospects mind.\\".<br />The Law of Perception (Law 4)\\"The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion. Marketing is a Manipulation of these perceptions. Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not products.\\"<br />The Law of Perspective (Law 11)\\"Many companies find they need a quartely dose of couponing to keep sales on an even keel. Any sort of couponing, discounts, or sales tends to educate consumers to buy only when they can get a discount.<br />The Law of Acceleration (Law 21)\\"Successful programs are not built on fads, they're built on trends. But the best, most profitable thing to ride in marketing is a long-term trend. This is a law I will always try to remember.<br />I really enjoyed this Marketing book. Please have a read - it will increase your knowledge of this main area of business in today's global, brand-orientated, complicated market-place.<br />Cheers - Vaughan Allison<br />PS. I'm off to read Marketing WAR-FARE!
B00005RHGK|5.0|this movie deserves 5 stars . so i hope i wont be there in the end if you (jeepers creepers) come around. i mean watch the movie till the end.
B00005JKZT|5.0|For one, it's nice to only have to wait 1 year for the sequel, unlike Star Wars flicks where we have to wait three years or so.  This movie was unusual in that it began with a climax and did not go downhill from there.  Admittedly, it has been quite some time (at least 10 years) since I read the novels, so it's a bit difficult to make accurate comparisons between the movie and the book, but I was greatly impressed nonetheless.  The war scenes were remarkable, effects believable, and the story intriguing.    The most impressive feature in the films so far has been the elves; this is the first time elves have appeared in movies being tall, courageous and showing the full splendor of their cities (those familiar with the \\"Dragonlance\\" novels can liken these more to the elves of Qualinesti); normally they are shown as more fairie-like, with odd, high-pitched voices and dwelling in trees.  <BR>Anyways, the film was not quite as involving as the first, perhaps due to the fact that the first had to reel the viewers in for the setup.  As that's already been established, this film focused more on the battles for the survival in the human race of Middle-Earth.  There were a few confusing parts in relating the different cities/kingdoms of humans to one another, but I guess that's due again to the fact that I haven't read the novels for a while.  The tree-herders were very well done (their scene in the final sequence of the film was off the hook), and it would have been nice to see Gandalf call down some lightning or something more explosive in the last battle..  I assume there were a few characters missing, but Pete Jackson managed to stuff all he could into three hours and it turned out pretty well.  My biggest complaint would be the same as that for the first film, as there's more fruity hobbit interaction at the end of the film.  You kinda have to wonder about Frodo and Sam's relationship after their exchanged comments and endearing stares into one anothers' eyes- kinda makes you cringe.  Granted, the hobbits are a friendly folk, but the scenes take it a bit far.<BR>  ...
0316666343|5.0|This was a great read - I couldn't put it down. I didn't think I would like this type of book but the author did a nice job in drawing me into it and feeling bad for the murdered 14 year old. I also admit to reading this because of the great words it received from the Good Morning America hosts - their comments were right on. I read some of the other reviews on here AFTER reading the book and they seem to be all over the place from love to hate, so I guess it depends on your tastes. I enjoyed the creative aspects of presenting the narrative from the viewpoint of heaven. Even the description of what heaven is like was a little creative - &quot;it's different for each person&quot;.  This author did a nice job of descriptive writing although the editing in places is a little rough and could use a grammatical clean up. Can't wait to read more by Seybold. Lovely Bones is on my top ten list of great books for this year.
B00004Y7SF|2.0|I purchased this CD from Amazon[.com] as soon as it came out.  Having it around for 3 Christmases now, I forgot how bad I thought it was until I popped it in one evening just before Christmas (this year) and listened all the way through.  <BR>Some reviewers are praising this CD, and if their ears are pleased by it I respect that.  I found it very hard to listen to.  In other reviews, you will hear words like \\"overdone\\" and \\"excessive trilling\\" and these are understatements.  Most of the songs are butchered almost beyond recognition, and this is disappointing because I find this artist talented and with much potential (though her image has been compromised recently). <BR>For the layman...say there were a few bars with 10 notes written.  Christina will instead sing 40 notes from squeaky high to tenor range.  If you like this sort of thing, buy it.  If you like things more traditional or just a little creativity, you won't like it.  There is too much \\"creativity\\" here.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I don't watch a lot of movies (have other interests) and, when I do, I don't delve much into the meaning of it (I'm not a scholar or a pro film critic).  From the very begining, this movie captured me with it's etherial/sci-fi mood and gripped my attention until the beautiful end.  It has a good, Pinocchio-like story, fine acting, and is well directed and produced.  If you find this doesn't stir you, you're jaded - give Hollywood a rest.
B00005JL78|5.0|if you don't like this movie, you should watch it again because you probably don't understand it.
1586210912|5.0|Mr. Kiyosaki's works have been a little controversial lately, what with some folks questioning the veracity of his backstory and others mentioning the gaps or dated information in his work. Both criticisms have at least some grounding, I've come to believe -- but niether substansially alters the value of this book. <br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad is meant as a primer.. a &quot;McGuffy Reader&quot; for personal finance as it were. I would NOT suggest relying on it for specific, critical points of information on real estate practices, tax law, etc etc. <br />However, I WHOLEHEARTEDLY recommend it as a means of changing self-defeating attitudes towards money, and as a general guide to financial practice. As such, I have already given away several copies to friends and family, and likely will continue to do so into the future. I can't recommend this book highly enough to the financial newcomer who's flummoxed by all the market talk, &quot;Get rich quick&quot; games, and &quot;we'll solve everything&quot; campaign speeches. <br />Finally, a personal note. If you come from a Liberal ideology, as I did originally, it will be hard reading. You will become furious with Mr. Kiyosaki's apparent lack of concern for the poor, and you will be tempted to write him off as a souless pig. If you find yourself having this reaction, READ IT AGAIN. And AGAIN. Try to understand what exactly he's saying, and WHY he's saying it. (hint.. &quot;because he's greedy&quot; isn't the right answer). What you learn will be invaluable, and literally life-changing.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I'll make this short. Steve Perry needs Journey, not the other way around. Excellent audio, superb video. Neal Schon still is one of the best guitar players on the face of the earth, Ross Valory and Jonathan Cain haven't missed a step and Deen Castronovo brings an intense punch to the beat of Journey. As for Steve Augeri, he wears the shoes as lead singer with no problem. With all due respect to Steve Perry, he can't carry the notes like he used to. That was evident in his last recording with Journey. Most bands that change the line-up seem to upset the integrity of the sound we're used to........NOT WITH THIS ONE MY FRIENDS, they sound much better.

B00007E8V4|5.0|Steal This Album is very different from System's first cd and Toxicity.  The first cd was very heavy, but it's by far the best System cd so far.  Toxicity was good, and it went more in the direction of speed and melody.  Steal This Album mixes the heaviness, speed, melody, and outragious vocals for a near perfect cd.  Here are my ratings of each song-<br />1. chic'n'stu- Kind of silly, yet in a good way.  7/10<BR>2. Innervision- This was the big hit on the radio, but it's probably one of the not so good songs on the cd.  7/10<BR>3. Bubbles- This is a pretty cool song.Very fast. 7/10<BR>4. Boom!- political song about the government spending money on bombs instead of starving children. Cool guitar riffs. 8/10<BR>5.Nuguns- Very cool song with an awesome mexican guitar solo in it.     8/10<BR>6. A.D.D.- One of my favorites, the vocals are awesome. 9/10<BR>7. Mr.Jack- AWEsOMe SoNG!!!- One of the best on the cd.  Awesome guitar riffs along with a cool duet by Serj and Daron.<BR>The screaming vocals by Daron are amazing.  10/10<BR>8. I-E-A-I-A-I-O- An O.K. song, the intro is what ruins it. 6/10<BR>9. 36- The worst song on the cd, it's really short, more like an intro to the next song.  5/10<BR>10. Pictures- A cool song with a point.  Serj makes funny noises in it.  8/10<BR>11.Highway Song- A good song. heavy intro, but it turns into a melodic tune that's really pretty.  8/10<BR>12. F**k the System- A very angry song. Serj makes even funnier noises in it, to show off his screwed up side.  8/10<BR>13. Ego Brain- Very pretty song.  Shows off Daron's guitar talents.  10/10<BR>14. Thetawaves- The best song on the cd. Very, very cool guitar playing and good lyrics. 11/10<BR>15. Roulette- Shows off System's soft side, starts off very pretty, but Serj kind of takes it down with corny, repetitive lyrics.  Not bad, though.  7/10<BR>16. Streamline- Cool lyrics, awesome rythm and beat, really cool guitar playing.  9/10<br />Overall, this is a very good cd.  I don't know what you're tastes are, but me and everyone I know love this cd.
B00004YRQA|5.0|You should get this memory card instead of a 3rd party one for many reasons. First is that lots of the third party ones require software to load it and thouh a small thing is inconvenient and not something you want to do every day. Second when you get a DVD remote and firmware upgrades the third party ones are not detected because sony programmed it so you had to have their brand. So dont waste your money getting a third party one when it won't be detected and therefore rendered useless for some games and firmware updates.
B00005O5CM|3.0|I saw the previews for the movie and liked what I saw.  When I bought the DVD, it wasn't exactly what I expected.  The movie has a few good quips, but nothing that made me really laugh.  The only reason Ali Lartner's character didn't get 20 to life is because Reese's character, Elle Woods, knows her hair care.

6305692572|3.0|Ever since seeing Ocean's 11, I have thought that Andy Garcia is a good actor, and that's true in this movie as well.<br />Though it did a decent job of representing the behavior of an alcoholic, the personification was WAY OFF!  Meg Ryan's healthy skin and hair just weren't realistic.<br />I did like the movie, and I'd venture to say that if the movie was made over someone would catch that and hire a new make-up artist.

0451207521|1.0|I waited for this book to come out in paperback because I thought the concept of a gang of female operatives in WWII would be interesting, and the single star I gave this novel is only for Follett's concept. Everything else in the book is predictable, boring or downright dumb.<br />I haven't read any of Follet's other novels, so I don't know if he has a habbit of creating the weak caricatures similar to those in Jackdaws or if he simply has a problem writing female chracters, but nothing about any of the characters --male or female -- rang true. At one point I had a strong image of Mr. Burns and Smithers from The Simpsons in my mind while reading about the Nazi spy-hunter and his assistant.<br />The romance that protagonist Flick finds herself in is downright gratuitous and unnecessary to the plot and all of the dialogue was just weak.<br />...
B00003CXFV|5.0|Despite the merit of those films that won all the 2000 Oscars, this film deserved more. Soderbergh's film was my favorite that year. It was totally entertaining, gripping, and handled the serious subject with humor and a straight-forward drive. There is never a dull moment. (I don't understand why &quot;Traffic&quot; won the Oscar for its choppy, coarse editing, while this wasn't even nominated). I've also never understood the standards involved in the Best Sound category, but every subtle whisper &amp; utterance of Susannah Grant's brilliant screenplay was clear, crisp and understood; also not nominated for Best Sound.  What the Oscars got totally right was Julia's performance. This was an example of total control and commitment. I haven't been so impressed in many years. I was also very impressed with the kid performances of Scotty Leavenworth &amp; Gemmenne de la Pena as Erin's kids. They were real and natural. I can't tolerate bad kid actors. I was impressed with the performances of Marg Helgenberger and Cherry Jones, and Jamie Harrold (as Scott) was perfectly dorky, a real treat. Then there was the great Albert Finney who seemed to be the centering force in the whole spiel. He was customarily excellent. This is, quite simply, an excellent film, and deserved a lot more credit than Julia's flawless performance. I find, lately, that this is the film I play when looking for a real &quot;feel good&quot; movie.
B00002781Y|5.0|I first heard of The Clash in high school when everybody was listening to should I stay or should I go.  Listening to London Calling, however, gave a perspective of waht this band was really about.<BR>To describe the musical content in this album in a few words is not fare since it contains the most redundant collection of musical and lyrical collection I have ever heard.  From pure angry rock statements to rockabilly, reaggea, jazz and rithym and blues.  What sets this record so far ahead of others is the fact that no other punk band, or any other band for that matter, has ever been able to make such a cross over in musical style without giving up their original aims and, consequently, their audience.  Other bands tried similar approaches, such as The Police, but none were able to achieve or sustain the same integrity demonstrated on London Calling.  It was with great grief that I learned of Joe Strummer's passing last tuesday.  Never again will The Clash reunite and never again will Rock burn with the same intensity.  Rest in Peace Joe..
078322799X|5.0|I really like this film! Michael J. Fox has always been at his best when he does the fantasy thing, and he's in top form here. I won't go into descriptions of stuff, because it's all been said. Fox has an energy that's unending, belying the sad trials of Parkinson's that he subsequently acquired. Peter Jackson is best known for &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, but his earlier work is quite profound (don't forget the haunting &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, giving Kate Winslet her big break). He shows a definite flair for fantasy. The make-up effects are bizarre, and the whole plot is so outrageous that it could only be pulled off with loads of humor, which is delivered in spades! The DVD gives an excellent transfer of the film, both in sound and picture, but the only extras are written biographies and production notes. I would've loved to see some interviews. This is the first film to present state-of-the-art special effects outside Hollywood (Jackson's own New Zealand), though I think it was filmed in the USA; Robert Zemeckis was the producer. Jackson also co-wrote the very clever script. The acting shows much dedication to the subject matter. It's a stellar cast, including Dee Wallace Stone (hard to think she was the mom in &quot;E.T.&quot;); John Astin, Chi McBride &amp; Jim Fyfe as good ghosts; Jake Busey (a natural as the psychotic ghost); Julianna McCarthy (excellent as the domineering mother); Peter Dobson (obnoxious by-stander); and the wonderful Lee Ermey, repeating his role from &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; as the marine sergeant ghost. A riot. The lovely Trini Alvarado could be confused for Andie MacDowell, except Trini has more facial expression &amp; character. She's quite fine. The GREAT performance in the film is from Jeffrey Combs, as the eccentric FBI inspector who's the true psychotic of the bunch. It's over-the-top and thoroughly entertaining. Danny Elfman's music adds his usual plus to the already amazingly creative goings-on, to present a totally wonderful experience. Check this out to discover the genius behind the man who ultimately gave us &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. This is a fine, fun film, as long as you let yourself kick back and run with it. You can't be disappointed!wonderful experience. Check this out to discover the genius behind the man who ultimately gave us &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.

B000002HH2|5.0|This album is one of the best if not the best of my musical collection.  Each song connects with the next, but each song is also very different from the previous.  This album is a journey.  There is not one song that I dislike on the album.  I highly recommend it!
1558807381|5.0|I always loved this movie I watched it as a child who was a big fan of unicorns. The storyline is great and the actors excellent and for that time the special effects were also satisfactory.
B000001FGG|5.0|In 1968 there we're three 2-lp set's issued. That we're destined for immortality.<br />1. THE BEATLES ~ WHITE ALBUM<br />2. ELECTRIC LADYLAND ~ JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE<br />3. WHEELS OF FIRE ~ CREAM<br />For us young pre-teen's, hearing someone really fire up a guitar was the thrill of a life. And no one did it better then CREAM.<br />Someone told me that the difference between JIMI HENDRIX and ERIC CLAPTON was that. JIMI was technicolor widescreen panoramavision. ERIC was enthusiastic personnel envisagement.<br />Any player worth their salt will tell you they wore out Crossroads learning it. In the days before TAB, you had to sit there and pick up the needle over and over. {No guitar tuner,either,lol.}<br />But really, this was always an over priced lp. And the cd is no exception. To tell the truth. You need to get the 4 cd set, THOSE WERE THE DAYS. It has everything by CREAM you will ever want. They put all the Studio stuff, (in order)on 2 cd's. And the Live stuff (put together like a live show, very well done)on 2 cd's. So it's way well worth the price.<br />SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD and BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN continue the great English pattern of bringing out the best of the older blues guitar player's. That was started by the STONES.<br />POLITICIAN showed them that they could write them just as well, too.<br />PASSING THE TIME, AS YOU SAID and THOSE WERE THE DAYS all are great textured songs, that later groups like LED ZEPPELIN would learn from.<br />The driver's: WHITE ROOM and DESERTED CITIES OF THE HEART, are the two direct in your face rocker's on this lp/cd.<br />NOW THE LIVE SIDE:<br />Of course there's CROSSROADS. Is there anyone who has not blown a speaker to this one?<br />To bad in those day's it was hard to get a great live recording!<br />SPOONFUL, took sometime to get into. After hearing ZEP's DAZED AND CONFUSED a few thousand time. I came back to SPOONFUL and POW! it hit me hard, what a great jam!!<br />TRAINTIME is the JACK BRUCE (him and his harp) and GINGER BAKER backing him up.(drag's on a little to long)<br />TOAD (drum solo time) One more time, TO BAD THEY COULDN'T RECORD LIVE STUFF IN THOSE DAY'S!!<br />But over all get the THOSE WERE THE DAYS, Better mastering for your buck's!!and GINGER BAKER backing him up.(drag's on a little to long)<BR>TOAD (drum solo time) One more time, TO BAD THEY COULDN'T RECORD LIVE STUFF IN THOSE DAY'S!!<br />But over all get the THOSE WERE THE DAYS, Better mastering for your buck's!!
B00005JL3A|3.0|I admit there were times wen it put u on edge and lots of suspense and the special effects weren't half bad but were as a lot of ppl probably liked the storyline I didn't really buy into it and I thought it could've been more scary
B000000OQF|4.0|Im not a big fan of Guns nRoses but I like good music and this album is good. It had some [great]tunes. The musicians are great and the production is amazing. The Album is enjoyable and disturbing and Axl Rose charisma and lyrics are also a big part of its brilliance. I recomend every rock fan to get this album ( if they already dont have it) because it is indeed a fantastic album which recieved 5 stars in Rolling Stone. One of the few heavy metal albums to get that. And Like happens to many acts after making a brilliant commercial and critical aclaimed debut they never followed it up.
6303443214|5.0|This is faithful enough to the book and the cast is excellent Cruise plays an excellent Lestat and Pitt a fantastic Louis. The special effects were magnificent and I don't think I've seen better actors or a better vampire film to date. <BR>I definitely reccomend this and all of Anne Rice's books the book does differ but the film is accurate enough.<BR>It is enjoyable and haunting and undoubtfully a film to watch
B0000640VO|5.0|Being away in Asia, and far from European civilisation, I had a chance to grab this wonderful memoire of Paris, and found it to be fresh and petillant.<br />Unlike most non-European films that I've been exposed to in Malaysia, Amelie Poussaint, reflects a typical parisian outlook on life with all its bleakness, innocence of human living that can only happen in Paris. Audrey Tatou the petite surbarbian carries the character well, and in not so many words, brought out one of the best movies I've watched over the past year.<br />I would recommend this movie to those who have not been to Paris, and those who would like to refresh memories of Paris again in their hearts. This film was made for you. And only you can know and experience the same flesh tingling effect of the movie, when you've lived in Paris. The air, the scent, the cafe, all these are not found elsewhere even in franchise cafes and makeover bistrots in Asia, or the US.
0385334206|5.0|This book should be read for several reasons:  <br />First, it is an important lesson in American history.  In the form of a fictional town, Vonnegut creates a brilliant (read \\"entertaining\\") satire of American life.  With great agility he addresses race, sexuality, gender, freedom, nature, and much more.  Although still largely applicable, this satire is dated (1972).  <br />Second, Vonnegut experiments with form; the narration occurs as an acummulation of loosely connected details.  This makes the book fast and fun to read--we skip from one interesting thought to the next, and before we know it, a plot develops.  The entire story is littered with profound ideas about life and art; Vonnegut is refreshingly honest and articulate concerning the great mysteries, including life's meaning and minimal art.  <br />Third, the author demonstrates his drawing talent (albeit it limited), with almost every other page hosting a small doodle.  While these pictures add little to the content, it is apparent that Vonnegut took great satisfaction in making a text complete with illustrations.  For this reason, I call it art.<br />Fourth, this book might actually encourage you to measure your genitals.  (So as to compare yourself with Dwayne, Kilgore, and the rest of the characters.)  And, as a bonus, the author reveals his own measurements.  In fairness, women are also reduced to their bust/waist/hips measurements.
B000066NW0|5.0|i love it!so many of my friends dont,but i dont see why!its happy and upbeat,it makes you smile!unlike some rubbish (cough, sum41!) no offence to anyone who does like this depressive, 'lets go kill myself music'
B00005NB0H|5.0|This is the Who CD to own - and make sure its the Deluxe Edition. The remastering is unbelievable (in fact so are all these Universal Deluxe Editions - brilliant). The first CD is probably familiar to fans and in most cases these live versions are far superior to the studio versions. Those who think Led Zep, Balck Sabbath etc invented heavy metal have a listen here !<BR>But the real suprise is the Tommy set. This blows the studio version away. The live version has Pete firing on his electric guitar and the band rock. <br />I would recommend this over the latest 2 CD Who collection as representing the definitive Who.
B00005JLWL|5.0|Why is this movie being kept such a secret?  No webpage, no soundtrack, and even dimensionfilms.com is inaccessible at the moment.  What's going on?  The only real evidence that this movie exists is what's been published here on Amazon and few horrible reviews by the critics elsewhere.  Bale is awesome in this movie and it's a performance that needs to be noticed.  No TV spots either.  No interviews with the cast.  It's like Dimension/Miramax just intends to flush this movie down the toilet.  I drove to another state to watch this film and it still wasn't even showing!  It has to be raking in the dough even in limited release.  When are the powers that be going to realize its potential for success at the boxoffice?
B00006X06U|5.0|Who would have thought that Joni Mitchell could take her own music and make it better.  With her voice deeper with age, she sounds fantastic, much as she has since Turbulent Indigo.  The orchestration matches her rich voice, and this is a pleasure to listen too.  Songs that used to sound dated (think Hejira from the original disc or Woodstock) sound very fresh and new and lush.  If you're a Joni Mitchell fan and liked Both Sides Now, this will be a treasure.  And since it's her last disc, it's a must have.
B0000542D2|5.0|The five stars I give above I give to Paul, John, George and Ringo...<br />Each new release has value, this is a compilation of interviews, and I have the original DVD release for sound.<br />May I recommend the original: &quot;First US Visit&quot; on Apple....This is a film Done by the Maysals Bros. and is the real live action Richard Lester basically reshot with better cameras and some control
0385508417|1.0|This Grisham Christmas fairy tale was a big disappointment.  The story of Nora and Luther Krank's (could he choose better names for his characters?) decision to &quot;skip Christmas&quot; was a slow read from beginning to end.  Travel plans, nasty, controlling neighbors and a pollyanna ending was laughable.  This book would never have been published in the first place had it not been written by Grisham.  He should stick to the type of writing he does best.  Christmas &quot;fairy tales&quot; are NOT Grisham's strength!
B000069AUI|5.0|Once again I will keep it short. This is a great album and I would almost liken it to the level of U2's Joshua tree.  Boy, I will probably get a lot of flak for saying that, but before you judge me, listen to the album a couple of times through and pay good attention.  It is absolutely beautiful and what a advancement in songwriting and musicianship.  This band will be around for a while no matter if you agree with me or not.  So, if you have not bought this album yet, do so and you will not regret it.
0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaiman is awesome. He has a clean, crisp command of language and an economy of style...but best of all is his fertile, off-the-wall imagination! You will catch references to Joseph Campell, Carl Jung, Bradbury and Gods know who else, here. I'm usually a pulp horror junkie (Shannon and his 2002 \\"Night of the Beast\\" for example) but this is literate and involving stuff that you don't have to feel a little embarassed to be caught reading on your lunch break at work. Glad I finally got around to reading the sucker. Kudos to Gaiman! Well worth your money.
B000031XCR|5.0|Of course, as a Celine fan, I love this collection. The hits they've selected are fabulous and the new songs are great. But I often wonder why they don't have other hits on here like her first English hit \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\" and her rafter-rattling rendition of \\"All By Myself\\". Oh well, I guess there weren't too many complaints, since this collection sold over six million in the US and over 17 million worldwide. <br />My song-by-song reviews:<br />1. The Power of Love (5/5). This one's such a powerful song, and Celine delivers it passionately and emotionally. Some may find that she belts too much in this song, but I find it great to listen to. <br />2. If You Asked Me To (4.5/5). This is a great song, too. I love how Celine starts out sounding so vulnerable and ends up sounding very powerful, like that someone who's finally found their true love. <br />3. Beauty and the Beast (5/5). I LOVE THIS SONG! Celine and Peabo Bryson do a wonderful job on it and the lyrics are wonderful. A very \\"Disney-sounding\\" ballad that will still be heard years from now. I especially like the instrumental part in the middle. <br />4. Because You Loved Me (5/5). One of the two songs that got me hooked on Celine. Some may find this a gooey, maudlin tune, but I love it. Celine delivers it very well and it's one of her best. <br />5. It's All Coming Back To Me Now (5/5). This is the one that really got me hooked on Celine Dion. It sounds so huge and so epic, and those are the kinds of songs that I like, more like opera than pop. Celine delivers her very best performance ever in this song. Check out the killer video too!<br />6. Love Can Move Mountains (3/5). While this is a good song, very upbeat and perky, it's not really one of my favorites. <br />7. To Love You More (5/5). In my opinion, this is THE very best song on the album. It's a very different-sounding kind of song with the wonderful violin and instrumentation, and the lyrics are top-notch. Celine gives a powerful, wonderful performance. <br />8. My Heart Will Go On (4/5). Ah, here it is, the unversally loved (or despised, take your pick) song. While it's very good (very powerful, emotional and sad to an extent), I don't agree with the EXTREMELY massive amount of attention it got. Celine has done better ballads, and while it was great to see her on TV all the time, for THIS song? Just my opinion.<br />9. I'm Your Angel (5/5). Celine Dion and R. Kelly = a wonderful song. I love the lyrics, and hearing Celine vibe like an R&B artist was refreshing to hear. <br />10. That's The Way It Is (4/5). The only hit off of this album. While it was a refreshing change of pace to hear Celine doing something sounding upbeat and young for a change, hearing Celine Dion sing a Max Martin song just sounds kind of...oxymoronic. <br />11. If Walls Could Talk (5/5). HERE'S a change of pace that suits Celine just fine. This sexy pop/country number, composed by \\"Mutt\\" Lange (aka Mr. Shania Twain), is very sensual and lovely. I also like how Celine doesn't really reach for the big notes in this one, she sounds more human here. <br />12. The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face (4.5/5). Celine does a very good job singing this classic ballad, and you can feel the emotion in her singing here. <br />13. All The Way (3.5/5). Here's one that most people probably wanted to hear, the duet with the late, great Frank Sinatra. While it's nice to hear, it just comes off as a little eerie. <br />14. Then You Look At Me (4.5/5). From the composer and writers of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" comes the sequel to that song. In my opinion, it's better than MHWGO. The orchestration is a little better, as are the lyrics and of course Celine delivers a BLOWING-AWAY vocal performance. <br />15. I Want You To Need Me (5/5). Written by Diane Warren and produced by rock-producer Matt Serletic (sp?), this ballad sounds very raw, powerful and rock-like, something like Aerosmith's \\"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\". Celine has said that this is a difficult song to sing because it's very high. Of course, that's right up her alley, and she pulls it off incredibly well. <br />16. Live - Ah, the final track on the album and listening to it, you can almost sense that Celine was singing about her then-upcoming retirement, and it has a wistfullness and sadness to it that comes across very strongly. THAT'S good singing. <br />I just can't sign off without mentioning the immature, mean-spirited and badly spelled reviews that have come from Mariah Carey fans. I have two words for these reviewers: GROW UP!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Jake Gyllenhaal, star of the godforsaken film Bubble Boy, gives the performance of his young career here as title character Donnie Darko.  In 1988, young Donnie is a borderline schizo who sees a grotesque man size reptilian/rabbit which he follows and obeys.  One night when Donnie goes off sleepwalking, the rabbit (who is called Frank) tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.  The next morning as Donnie stumbles home, we see his home has been decimated by a jet plane engine.  It is here where Donnie begins to wonder if all this really is all in his head, or if he isn't crazy and is meant for something more.  As the film rolls along he meets and falls in love with the new girl (Jena Malone), and becomes obsessed with the theories of time travel.  Patrick Swayze is here as a self help guru who may or may not be who he says he is, and nearly steals the show with his great performance.  Mary McDonnel is great as well as Donnie's mother, and Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore (she also was an executive producer of the film) play husband and wife teachers.  Writer/director Richard Kelly has crafted an unbelieveably moving film that scares, shocks, and plays with the mind of the viewer while having a sense of dark humor to it all.  All in all, those craving a different kind of thriller should definitely give this a look.  This is destined to become a cult classic, and the fact Donnie goes to see Evil Dead in a theater makes this film even more of a gem.
B000002HMH|4.0|After listening to Load for several years, I decided that there are a couple of different ways of looking at this album. First lets look at this thru the eyes of those that are screaming that Metallica sold out by making this album(if in fact they hadn't already sold out by making the Black Album). These are the people that think Pantera and Slayer are true to themselves by releasing the same songs rehashed album after album. Don't get me wrong I like those bands, but I will take a carefull listen before I buy any new material by them, generally it never changes. I don't want to hear any of the radio play b.s.  The world came to Metallica not the other way around. Making another Master of Puppets to please the fans would have been truly selling out, instead the boys grew musically and explored other paths and I applaud them for it. They were true to themselves with Load(and Reload subsequently). I should say that this is not my favorite Metallica album, but that does not lessen the music on this disc. It is different. When compared to other music released at the time, this disc kicks (butt). What many would consider to be the weakest Metallica  disc still whips anything else out there. Same goes for Reload. Keep up the good work boys.
B00005JKZT|3.0|Peter Jackson has done some wonderful things with his making of \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" amd some disgraceful things with the<BR>\\"Two Towers\\".<br />I understand not being able to have everything in the movie that is in the books. BUT, I feel rewriting parts of a masterpiece is<BR>unforgivable. The escape to and from The Prancing Pony should not<BR>have been touched, the ride to Rivendale should have been as in the book. (The <BR>Extended Version is much better.)<br />In the Two Towers it was unforgiveable for Jackson to have re-written the Chapters 4,5, and 6 of Book 4. He presents Faramir<BR>falsely and destroys what Tolkien was trying to relate-that there<BR>were some honorable men who would help Frodo and not try and steal the Ring. The movie would have been so much better if Jackson had just followed the books.<br />Jackson's creation of Gollum and Treebeard was magnificent and he<BR>he did a wonderful job with them.<br />The movie is worth haveing all the same..
B00006RAKP|5.0|Without boring you with things that you already know, it is a definite must have for any collection that centers around rock and roll.  The man and Bernie Taupin are both a genius.  After looking at the track listing, you might notice a couple greats were left out like Father to Son, Country Comfort, Burn Down the Mission and most surprisingly, the fan favorite Mona Lisa'a and Mad Hatters.  Other than those and a few others, it is great.  Hey we all can't have everything right!
B00006JSS8|5.0|Universal Music has tackled the difficult task of bringing a \\"The Definitive Collection\\" featuring the legendary composer, arranger, producer and artist of the last century ~ Stevie Wonder!  If you were just starting a collection of this icon, this my friend would be the one to pick up.  Inclusive is the twenty-one tracks of a musical journey paved with gold.<br />But the Wonder's ballads surface with some of the most compelling tracks.  Try these on for size ~ \\"MY CHERIE AMOUR\\", one of his biggest ballads from 1969, an arrangement and lyrics that just lay there in your heart and simmer ~ \\"YOU ARE THE SUNSHINE OF MY LIFE\\", every artist including Sinatra recorded this one, a number one 1972 hit that still holds up today as then ~<br />\\"I JUST CALLED TO SAY I LOVE YOU\\", another number one from 1984 still holds up as a classic that can bring out the romantic in anyone, just listen to Stevie sing the longing lyrics that seems to bring the ache out of your very soul ~ \\"OVERJOYED\\", melody and lyrics just keep getting better with each year, take this 1985 ultimate classic---the sandman has come from to far away---they just don't write them like that anymore.  This is some rare cues that will tear at your heart.<br /><br />Of course if its funk that grabs you here goes ~ \\"PART-TIME LOVER\\", as Wonder just keeps cranking them out, from 1985 his magic touch just kept the hits pouring out like a golden faucet ~ \\"SUPERSTITION\\", was a favorite of my daughter and her pom-pom group in school, you can't select a better song with a beat to die for than this 1972 classic ~ \\"LIVING FOR THE CITY\\", talk about getting under your skin, this has all the ingredients of super-strutting down your favorite main street ~ just keep struttin' we now have \\"YOU HAVEN'T DONE NOTHIN'\\", a 1974 tune that can take you downtown on the thoroughfare of funk ~ \\"BOOGIE ON REGGAE WOMAN\\", another 1974 super hit tells it like it is, listen to funky piano man play this down and dirty.<br />A collection of this magnitude comes along just once in a great while---if you're a fan or want to maintain your collection on the highest level of musical genre---then this ultimate or may I say \\"definitive collection\\"---is a keeper in the career of Stevie Wonder!<br />Total Time 79:56 on 21 Tracks ~ UTV Records 440-066-164-2 ~ (2002)de comes along just once in a great while---if you're a fan or want to maintain your collection on the highest level of musical genre---then this ultimate or may I say \\"definitive collection\\"---is a keeper in the career of Stevie Wonder!<br />Total Time 79:56 on 21 Tracks ~ UTV Records 440-066-164-2 ~ (2002)
B000005L86|5.0|The winning formula: Lee Scratch's soft dub touch + Cedric Mynton's very unique falsetto (especially for reggae)+ some very heartfelt texts  = the best reggae album I have ever heard. This is the real thing; the pure stuff. An absolute must for any listener of reggae, but everyone should hear this uplifting music. Very spiritual.  You'll see....
B000065U1N|5.0|Visionary director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner, the original Alien) re-created with exacting detail a fateful day in Somalia involving a U.S. Ranger mission when everything that couldn't have gone wrong, did.  During the first half hour of the film we get to meet the main characters and get to know them pretty much before we see them get thrust head first into the hell of war.  That alone is what Black Hawk Down portrays while pulling no punches, that war is hell, and if Scott would not have been on board as director this film would not have hit on the same emotional level as it does.  The cast includes Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewen McGregor, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Ewen Bremner, Ron Eldard, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Piven, Jason Isaacs, and Orlando Bloom, with Hartnett's as the most surprising of all, proving that he can act and isn't a teeniebopper film heart throb.
0553260111|5.0|A Great thriller with a strong plot and amazing suspense. The movie equalled the book in action and suspense, but the movie didn't follow the book at all and had no real plot. Don't be fooled. The book is much better than the movie. This is a thriller you couldn't possibly not enjoy.

B00000DGUG|5.0|This is Alanis' greatest CD. No it's not her most succesful, but in my opinion it's her best. I love all of the songs. I'm not going to breakdown all of the songs because that would take just a bit too much time.<br />My favorite tracks are: \\"U R\\"  \\"Can't Not\\"  \\"I Was Hoping\\"  \\"Joining You\\" and \\"Would Not Come\\". All of the rest of the songs are awesome, none of them are bad at all.<br />This is Alanis at her best.. at peace, mature, but still rockin! it's a great CD, even better than the very popular \\"Jagged Little Pill\\". Alanis has changed a lot in her music career, but this is her best change. \\"Under Rug Swept\\" is very different and is sort of quiet compared to her previous two releases. I can't say enough times how much I love this CD. It will always be one of my favorites. Always and forever! I love Alanis beyond words, but I'm sure Alanis could write a song about it. I reccomend this CD to anyone at all. This is definitely a must have for all Alanis fans. Enjoy!!!!!
B000067CPX|4.0|With their new cd, \\"By the Way\\", the chili peppers have toned down their sound, delivering album that is sometimes beautiful, often wonderful, but also occasionally \\"lame\\"(for lack of a better word\\" <BR>On the wonderful/beautiful side, songs like \\"the zephyr song\\" \\"I could die for you\\" and \\"dosed\\" come through as standout tracks, but unfortunately other songs (\\"Universally speaking\\", \\"on mercury\\") don't elicit anything more then yawns. Even with all the slow music on this cd though, the peppers can still rock and roll as several of their harder songs are awesome. (\\"Minor thing\\", \\"By the way\\" etc.) Overall, this new peppers album really shows off the bands musical talent and showcases a wide variety of their abilities. Other then a few clunkers, this cd(16 songs too!) delivers the goods. Check it out
B00006CXXU|5.0|Easily one of the best albums of 2002,'Stripped' shows us a more mature side to Christina Aguilera.Forget about her image and focus on her voice.She is obviously the most talented 'pop princess' out there and you would be a fool to deny it.<br />1.)Stripped Pt. 1-Interlude<br />2.)Can't Hold Us Down(Featuring 'Lil Kim)(10/10)-A total girl power song with an awesome rap from Kim.<br />3.)Walk Away(910)-Show's of Xtina's powerhouse vocals.Lyrics are well written and the beat is good.<br />4.)Fighter(10/10)-A rock type song with Dave Navarro(Foo Fighters)on guitar.It's one of my faves!<br />5.)Infatuation(Interlude)-Interlude<br />6.)Infatuation(8/10)-A Latin-flavored song with an awesome chorus.<br />7.)Loving Me 4 Me(Interlude)-Interlude<br />8.)Loving Me 4 Me(5/10)-My least favorite.<br />9.)Impossible(8/10)-A song Xtina did with Alicia Keys.Pretty Jazzy.<br />10.)Underappreciated(7/10)-Not a favorite.<br />11.)Beautiful(10/10)-Easily the best song on the album.<br />12.)Make Over(8/10)-Different.But I like it.<br />13.)Cruz(8/10)-See \\"Make Over\\".<br />14.)Soar(8/10)-A slow song that again shows of Xtina's vocals.<br />15.)Get Mine Get Yours(9/10)-Yes,it's about sex.But does that mean it's a bad song?No.One of my faves.<br />16.)Dirrty(10/10)-I know a lot of people don't like this song and think Xtina was skanky or whatever but I LOVE this song!<br />17.)Stripped Pt.2-Interlude<br />18.)The Voice Within(10/10)-Another beautiful song with Xtina's strong,powerful voice.<br />19.)I'm OK(10/10)-A very sad,touching song about her childhood and her abusive father.Whip out the tissues when you listen to it.<br />20.)Keep on Singin' My Song(7/10)-Honestly,I have only listened to this song like twice.<br />It's been said before and I'll say it again:Don't judge this album by \\"Dirrty\\".Although that song was the intial reason I purchased \\"Stripped\\" I must say that I love the entire album.It will be worth your money.Even if you don't like Xtina,you will like this album.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this CD on the basis of snippets I'd listened to in the store, never having heard a single by Norah Jones. I was delighted with this serendiptious purchase of mine, and listened to it on repeat for a VERY long time.<BR>Jones has a deep husky voice, and sings Bluesey tunes, sometimes with Western or Hispanic influence, that show her abilities off brilliantly. Her compositions are lovely, but all the songs on the album are performed with emotion, empathy and understanding. As well as being a talented singer and songwriter, she's a good pianist, and the other musicians on the CD also perform extremely well. Overall, the album has a very soothing, melodic tone that is perfect for long afternoons or evenings. Although it is a little short for my liking I have no hesitation in recommending this album to virtually anyone.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|this is a great movie one of my favoritedisney movies i just love this movie.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I wish all these people would stop grading this movie down because it deviates from the book. This is Hollywood people, not literary class 101. Making a film is a very different prospect from writing a novel. In Hollywood they are constantly changing the plotlines of books when adapting them to film. For Example, if you've ever read the novel The English Patient, and then watch the film, you will see that they are basically entirely different stories. The novel version worked for its author, winning the Booker prize, while the movie version worked for Hollywood, winning 9 Oscars. Peter Jackson took the source material and crafted it into what he considered to be the best story for the screen. I think people who judge this film against the novel are simply missing the point. When judged on its own merits, this is an outstanding film. If you liked the first movie you will not be dissapointed in the Two Towers, unless you are going to compare every plot change against the story as told in the book. This is not the novel The Two Towers, it is the film version and should be judged accordingly.
B000002MX7|5.0|This CD is awesome!!! What better way to spend a Saturday afternoon than sitting, smiling and listening intently to this CD. There isn't! <br />Epiphany...a sudden revelation! What a concept, but who hasn't heard of Chaka Khan. She's the essence of greatness, personified in a voice. Her sense of timing, passion, texture and variety helped to create a super musical career. I bet she's an awesome person to have this greatness within her.<br />Ain't Nobody is the perfect entry into her catalog of songs. It's funky, streetwise and ethereal at the same time. How often do you get that combination?<br />Other honorable mentions are the classics 'I Feel For You', 'I'm Every Woman' and 'Through The Fire'. Those are worth the price of admission alone. Then you get surprises like 'A Night In Tunisia', 'The End Of A Love Affair' and 'Love Me Still'. What a collection!<br />I could go through and rate all the songs, but I'll just say that I''m waiting for an encore. I missed hearing some of the other great Chaka songs like 'Be Bop Medley', 'Got To Be There', 'This Is My Night', 'Eye To Eye', 'My Funny Valentine', 'Clouds', 'Love You All My Lifetime', 'You Can Make The Story Right' and so many more. I know an encore (Volume 2) is coming. How can it not?
B00005JKZT|5.0|The two towers was definately a good film. It certainly surpassed the first film. The storyline was expertly duplicated from the original tolkien book. Sam and Frodo travel to Mordor in the company of the creature Gollum, which Frodo has apparently \\"tamed\\". Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli set out to find and rescue Merry and Pipin who were kidnapped at the end of the last movie. Upon the way they find Gandalf who was thought to have perished in the prequel. The Gandalf that they found was transformed and is no longer the waker Gandalf the Grey but is now the everpowerful Gandalf the white. the four travelers now set upon their quest for Gandalf had already found Merry and Pippin and had entrusted their well keeping to the tree-like creature (an ent) Treebeard. the four travelers set upon their journey to the kingdom of rohan. Their King,Theoden who was some what \\"possesed\\" by the dark wizard Saruman was cured by Gandalf. the Forces of Rohan then waged war between their Keep,(Helm's Deep) and saruman's forces. this battle was by far the most exciting part of the movie. the combination on stunning graphics and sword and arrow techniques make it by far the best of all movies since Gladiator. Meanwhile, while battle wages between the two superforces, Merry and Pippin convince thhe Ents to wage war against saruman. The ents succesfully dethrown saruman and seize his kingdom. The movie was a great one. You need not go to the cinema to see it's magnificence for i downloaded it on kazaa. but it you do decide to go to the cinema, be glad that you spent your money wiseley!!! Now go on and see the movie!!!<BR>Try and wait for the return of the king. but read the book first.<BR>Thanks for reading my review, do reccomend me!!<br />thanx<BR>Anarchy00
052594527X|5.0|I received this gift from an art gallery owner after making the oft-handed remark that the Old Masters were too representational in their art and today would be replaced by cameras. And that modern artists, though rarely having the same technical prowess, nonetheless are interpretive in their work and thus more intellectually challenging and provocative.  Well -- ahem -- this book demonstrates the narrative in the work of an Old Master and never have I been so happy to have made too much a sweeping generalization before.<br />Clever, imaginative, believable, insightful and educational ... the adjectives that most novels strive for but few seldom achieve. Chevalier fills in the blanks of a painting who's mystery and allure is second only to the Mona Lisa. Told from the subject's perspective, you'll gather an appreciation for the true soul of a great painting - the human interest stories that go on behind it, as well as the artist's techniques that bring it to life. <br />A great book for yourself and for someone as a gift! It's just about impossible not to be drawn in and engaged by this book.
B00005JKZT|3.0|Far too many people have prattled on about how this film (and its predecessor) are among the greatest in Cinema history. Utter, utter bunk. This is a great rainy Saturday afternoon matinee, and if all that was being claimed for it were that, I'd give it four or five stars.<br />But no, there is a hard core of mediaeval battle revivalists (which, to my surprise, seems to comprise a large part of the film-going population) who say that with this series Peter Jackson has redefined cinema, and to them (well, you, I guess) I say he has done nothing of the kind, unless you call the cinematic equivalent of \\"I Love 1983\\" a re-definition of cinema.<br />Which is my first beef: far from being a \\"triumph of the imagination\\", this has to be one of the least original films I've ever seen. Every scene is saturated in clich&eacute;. What perhaps ought to be respectful cap-doffing to celluloidal elders comes off as plain derivative - derivative, what's more, of B-Grade films: Gandalf is Ben Kenobi; the battle of Helm's Deep is the final scene of The Alamo; the ogres turning the treadmill to open the gates of Mordor ape Schwarzenegger's opening scene in Conan the Destroyer; the troll-like horsey things streaming across the uplands are straight out of Jurassic Park, the apocalyptic riders on their dinosaur-winged pterodactyls from that frightful Sinbad movie; the walking trees (walking trees? WALKING TREES?? Give me a break!) right out of Labryrinth. There is even a straight-faced impersonation of Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, and one of those ugly bad dudes was so closely modelled on Nosferatu I'm not convinced it wasn't Max Schreck playing the part.<br />There was nothing new, no agenda set, no trail blazed at all: What you have is Willow, Excalibur, Labyrinth, Krull, Highlander, Clash of the Titans, Conan the Barbarian, the pilot for Robin of Sherwood and the serious bits (!) from Monty Python and the Holy Grail rolled into one big bag, and given a CGI budget that would make third world nations weep.<br />All of this with nothing more is still, of course, a pretty cool movie experience. It's grand, it's epic - they haven't made films with this sort of sweep for fifty years, so it's great to see - but Jackson's such a gifted director, and he's got a track record of making such perceptive, witty, moving pieces of cinema (see for example Heavenly Creatures and Forgotten Silver), that I think we're entitled to expect a little more. But that's all you get.<br />Part of the problem, I think, is over-reverence. THIS MOVIE IS SO PO-FACED IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. Like it or not, the idea of walking tree-shepherds is patently potty. So Tolkein thought of it: fine, if you can't bring yourself to do some judicial editing, put it in. But do you need to keep a straight face about it? A film in this genre desperately needs the off-the-ball wit and timing of a Jim Henson - or a Peter Jackson, for that matter - it really needs comic relief.  But Jackson dares not commit that sacrilege. The nearest he gets is a dwarf with a Brian Blessed fixation and a schizophrenic goblin thing with a ring complex, which you'll be glad to hear looks exactly like it sounds: i.e. a naked David Bowie.<br />You CANNOT expect (well - should not be able to, at any rate) an audience to sit through three hours of pre-Raphaelite mush featuring elfin dialogue (helpfully subtitled!), possessed kings, wizards on white chargers, immortal fairies and earthy maidens, legions of ugly monsters (ten thousand strong, sirrah) and leading characters who have nary a finger laid on any of them in three hours of non-stop close-quarters battle, in which the enemy body count can be measured in thousands, without at least a knowing wink.<br />But, even from Jackson, a knowing winker par excellence, there is none. All this effort, all this budget, all this talent, and what you get is a film which rests content on its surface thrills. The characters don't develop -the actors inject no personality or interpretation into their acting: the dialogue tells us that Frodo is becoming increasingly corrupted by the ring, but nothing in his actual performance does. Aragorn is the dullest hero-figure since Kevin Costner. And he never shaves, but his three day growth never grows. Christopher Lee is reduced to his stock in trade as a hammy evil-dude bit-part.<br />Finally, at the end of this buttock-torturing instalment, we are no closer at all to the quest than we were at the beginning. There's a working definition of gratuitous, if ever there was one.<br />Look, it's good, no doubt about that. Compared to Lara Croft, Tomb Raider or Battlefield Earth, it might seem like a work of genius. But in any context wider than that, it's just another sword and sorcery epic.<br />And really, what is with those walking trees?e actors inject no personality or interpretation into their acting: the dialogue tells us that Frodo is becoming increasingly corrupted by the ring, but nothing in his actual performance does.

B000000OAN|5.0|Queen's masterpiece: A sublimimal pice of rock history worthy of any comparision. From the incredibly romantic &quot;Love of my life&quot; to Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon (What ever gender that occupies:Please tell me) this is an eclyptic work that ecompasses all tastes in good quality music.<br />A masterpiece: Freddie, we look back and we find that we still love you.
B000067CPX|4.0|This record swims with beauty and pulses with funky rhythm; if Calfornication was the investment, By The Way is the payoff. We hear the Chilis mastering their melodic gifts. From sharp hip-hop to lush strings, fiery latin to staccato bass, they are as eclectic as they are unique. \\"Midnight\\" in particular must be heard to be believed.  I got this record months ago and that song still amazes. The reviewer who called By the Way a \\"waste of musicianship\\" is a fool. Do yourself a favor and pick it up, even if you don't consider yourself a Red Hot Chili Peppers Fan. That the Chilis are pioneers has been evident all along, but By The Way proves that they have the musicianship to match their invention.
B00006LSM3|5.0|What a great guy George is.  Sure, I didn't know him, but I know a lot of his music.  And Brainwashed is wonderful.<br />Its got a lot of what I like about George, his sincerity, stimulating, great melodies, profound comments on his and our world, wry tongue-in-cheek nod and winks.  Jeff Lynne's production makes this just a tad too slick but its not overly-produced.  A lot of Georges's textures on guitar and vocals really shine and what great stuff that shines.  A collection of a nod to the past while accepting what awaits him in the future.  Not heavy, just matter of fact-ly and ever-hopeful, as George always is.  <br />He's never sounded better on guitar, especially on the slide, and he plays other strings as well.  A variety of tunes here, all with George's diverse sounds and styles.  But I have to tell you, the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues,\\" is nothing short of breathtaking.  Really.<br />I love George and I'll miss future new stuff from him, but this is an outstanding last sharing from this man who left us too soon.
B00007E8V4|5.0|System cannot fail to deliver good music. They bring back the hard metal lost to this generation of Linkin Park. The lyrics recall those of hard core punk bands such as Black Flag coupled with the driving riffs of Slayer. Serji's voice is very flexible. If you enjoyed Toxicity than this is a logical buy. Highly Reccomended!
0553582445|4.0|Ms. Hobb again delivers a very good story, and actually expands the Wit considerably, and continues to expand the fertile world of her imagination.<br />Fitz still is Fitz, but he has changed a bit. It starts with a visit from Chade, and continues with the return of the Fool. Chade is very much similar to who he was at the end of Assassin's Quest, the Fool is considerably changed.<br />As always, the story is far more character driven than many stories in the standard Fantasy genre. This is not to say there is no action, only that the action is not central to the story, but is appropriate when it occurs.<br />Again the call of responsibility and duty pull Fitz into an adventure, ironically to in service to the Queen and the tracking of Prince Dutiful, her son. This proves to be a bit more difficult than it originally seems. Success does come, but as is normal with the Six Duchies, not wihtout sacrifice.<br />It would appear that Assassin's Quest was written while Ms. Hobb had been indulging herself in Elfbark tea. This does not continue to be the case here. Though there are certain dark aspects to this book, it is much brighter than the conclusion of the Farseer trilogy.<br />I would strongly recommend this book, but would suggest that one reads through the Farseer Trilogy (Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin, Assassin's Quest) first. The characters' histories are as much a part of the story as the story itself. There is no preface to delineate those very rich histories.

B00006RU5B|4.0|This is a pretty good Cd. I really enjoy Gasoline and Cochise. This album however does not reflect the full potential this band can achieve. The lyrics have lost their political side and its mainly the Chris Cornell lyrics common to his Soundgarden albums. Anyway highly reccomended!
B000003CUJ|4.0|This is a great addition to the Opera fan's library.<br />It has only selections from Wagner's Magnum Opus, &quot;The Ring of the Niebelungs&quot;.  But the selections are those that most fans of Wagner's opera will recognize.  What opera fan would fail to remember &quot;The Ride of the Valkyries&quot;?  But these selections have no words, maiking hearing the music behind the lyrics even easier for the Opera fan.<br />And what Opera fan hasn't tried to sing in the shower?  The only &quot;fault&quot; (if there is one) to this album is that there are no lyrics in the liner notes to complement the music - which would have made this the world's first opera karaoke.<br />Fans of Wagner will really get to listen to the music, which can occasionally be almost drowned out by famous singers who can overpower the orchestra.  And it provides a good introduction to Wagner's &quot;Ring&quot; cycle - a compilation of almost 15 CD's if one were to buy the entire opera cycle, since each of the parts is almost an opera in itself.<br />Well worth adding to an opera fan's library, or to classical music radio stations who would not otherwise provide &quot;opera&quot; to their listeners.
B00005JLRR|3.0|Overall I enjoyed this movie. It was escapism. For fans of TNG there are many familliar inside jokes and other things to keep your atttention. The film has some fine comedic moments. The special effects are superior. The plot is not the strongest in the series of movies produced under this dynasty. I agree that it draws from many other movies from the series. Not bad in and of itself but you can certainly tell that the screenwriters have seen a lot of Star Trek movies in which to pattern this one from. The Data storyline is almost laughable and of course leaves the door open for sequals. Just wait and you will see! Overall the movie was not bad.

B00005R23Z|5.0|Andrew Niccols' \\"Gattaca\\" takes place in a \\"not so distant future,\\" but like all serious science fiction works, it is a commentary about the present. In its stylishly sequenced narrative, reminiscent of a honey-washed and glowing photo spread in an old issue of Life magazine, or the best of a high-end merchandizing catalog, it is also a passionate tribute to the romantic notion that the human spirit is, and always will be, beyond the icy grip of science.  <br />The film tells the story of the allegorically named Vincent Freeman(Ethan Hawke) who sets out to follow his dream of space travel, even though he was born the \\"old-fashioned\\" way, which renders him genetically flawed. As such, he is forced to work in low-level occupations, the fate of all \\"In-Valids,\\" who represent the untouchables of that not-so-distant-future in which genetic engineering has replaced the divisive powers formerly held only by wealth alone. Vincent, resourceful because of his spirit -- for which there is no gene, as the movie's tagline suggests -- finds a way to make his dreams a reality, though not without the help of a disabled \\"Valid\\" (Jude Law). The \\"Valid,\\" Jerome, who lends Vincent his identity, as well as regular samples of his blood, urine, and other genetic identifiers used in monitoring society's privileged caste, while in possession of superior genes, lacks the one thing that transforms dreams into reality: the spirit of ambition -- or the desire to conquer the universe. <br />Ironically, it may have been that very same romantic ambition of the human spirit, which drives Vincent towards the stars, that brought the deadening \\"perfection\\" of the tightly controlled world of \\"Gattaca\\" into being in the first place -- but that's more of a comment on the nature of romanticism, rather than on this movie. I bring this up mostly because of the Wagnerian tones in the soundtrack, which was composed and arranged by Michael Nyman. The relentless striving apparent in the themes of the music gives the movie another critical dimension in which to build its vision of the triumphs of the human spirit over the soulless rigors of science.<br />The acting in this movie is superb, not in least because of the stress on the ensemble of actors over individual performances as such. There is a great deal of power in the subtly restrained acting styles of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman in their respective roles. Having said that, it seems to me that Jude Law's performance as the \\"Valid\\" Jerome, who has everything but that one important passion to hold it all together, stands out because of his understanding that this character is perhaps more interesting than the genetically flawed Vincent, who has but a single all-consuming -- and therefore, limiting -- ambition. Jude Law's performance in this movies foreshadows his performance in Spielberg's A.I.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|The best movie and the best soundtrack for a movie of all time.  There is nothing more to add to that.  That is the absolute truth.  It will change you, for better or worse.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This was the best movie I ever saw!!!!! This and ofcource the first lord of the rings movie. It has so much going on at the same moment it is never boring. It is very scary but still in some parts you want to cry. The ending is so annoying because you always want more. That is really smart so ofcource i just cant wait for the 3 lord of the rings. So as you can see I recommend this movie to EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000064G|5.0|This is actually one of the most relaxing albums I've ever heard. &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is ideal for 3am listenings, when the world is quiet and still and you want to be alone with your thoughts. The gorgeous title track, &quot;Place To Be&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Horn&quot; are my current favorites, but everthing here is so beautifully sung and simply played, singling out any favorites is kind of beside the point. One can actually hear Drake slowly coming unraveled emotionally as he sings (and sometimes mutters) his disquieting and somewhat caustic lyrics. The fact that he died not long after this was released adds a certain poignance to these proceedings, but one leaves away from &quot;Pink Moon&quot; feeling refreshed and invigorated, sort of like having a new lease on life. Just dim some lights, lie down on a big fluffy pillow and let Nick take you by the hand and lead you into the ether.....you'll never be the same again.<br />Bonus; the guitar playing here is a marvel of simplicity!<br />R.I.P. NICK DRAKE, you were a visionary.

Ohh yes, the terrible CGI...<br />But Mary Jane falling off the bridge? next time read the comic, Mr. Raimi, or you could watch X-Men (I have to say that I'm not big fan of them) or Batman and learn how a good comic book based movie should be done. Take this from a 22+ year reader of Spider-man...<br />...to quote J. Jonah Jameson (BTW him was excellent) from the movie: \\"crap...crap...mega crap\\". If you still want to see this, erase from your memory all your existing knowledge of Spider-man.
0345441184|5.0|This wonderful book is one of the best Arthurian books I have read. The story takes place in the minds of the women behind the throne, though I am sure you will hear that from many other reviews...<BR> To read in Morgaine's eyes, I felt what it is like to be pagan, and to think LIKE a pagan. For a christian, it opened my eyes to how these people think, and made me all the wiser. Instead of thinking (mogan Le Fay) evil, I rooted for her! <br />Every person in this story I felt I knew as I read it. Instead of being myths and witnessing only a memory, they are brought to life. Instead of somewhat hating Guinevere for the hurt she and Lancelot cause Arthur, I understood her pain. <BR>Each place in the story relives, from Tintagel to Camelot, I felt a part of the journey.<br />It has been at least two years since I read this book, yet I have not forgotten a word of it. <BR>I definately recommend this! It is great for learning exactly what it is like living in this time period!

Saw the website (phd.stanford.edu), but still bought the book, and browsed through it in a couple of days - as Jorge Cham says, procrastinate with purpose and pride!  Though I don't face many of the dangers he depicts (our qualifiers are easier, I stay off-campus, I always had funding), it all rings so true (if you have ever swapped stories with other grad students...).  I am going to keep it in my lab as 'required reading'.

B00005OAIE|4.0|What I like about John Mayer...Hmmm...there are so many things. When I first heard John Mayer, I wasn't horribly impressed. This generally isn't the type of music I go for. I tend to stay away from \\"pop\\", but the more I listened to John, the more he grew on me. The honesty in his music is very refreshing. He totally jeers away from bubblegum pop and ventures into real music. That's what I like about John Mayer: His music is REAL!!!
B00005JL78|3.0|Steven Spielberg translates a short story by the late Science Fiction legend Philip K. Dick to the big screen.  Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, a policeman from the Pre-Crime division of 2054 Washington, DC.  Anderton's division uses future visions of murders from three waterbound \\"precogs\\" to arrest the perps before they commit the crime.  No one can successfully commit premeditated murders anymore in the DC area without being caught, so all murders are the sudden, \\"act of passion\\" variety.  When a precog's vision shows that Anderton himself will commit the next murder, he flees, expecting a conspiratorial set-up, and the chase is on through Spielberg's version of the future, where technology is shown to be fascinating and wonderful.  The complex nature of the plot may be hard to follow and off-putting to those unaccustomed to the machinations of complex Science Fiction, but the images of the future's advertising and transportation technologies are compelling and realistic.  The film also provides an opportunity to see one of the greatest living actors, Max Von Sydow, in a bigtime Hollywood action flick.

B00005JLSC|5.0|Plain and simple, I was floored by this movie.  <br />\\"Chicago\\" is one of my favorite stage shows; I know the show backwards and forwards. Therefore, I was very cynical about everything from the concept to the casting.  When I heard the opening notes of the overture come from that big screen, and realized that they didn't really edit it, I had a glimmer of hope.  The opening number, \\"All That Jazz\\", then blew all of my cynicism out of the water.  <br />Most people don't know that Catherine Zeta-Jones (Velma Kelly) and Richard Gere (Billy Flynn) both started on the stage. All of the stars did highly admirable jobs with their characters, especially John C. Reilly as Amos Hart. The energy and emotion is carried seamlessly from scene to scene, weaving the story (dare I say) almost spellbindingly.  As a theatre person, and Broadway groupie, I have to mention that the ensemble dancers are largely culled from the ranks of Broadway 'gypsies'.....I recognized several names from shows that I've seen on Broadway.  This only helps add to the \\"stage feeling\\" of the movie.<br />It's also the reason that the musical numbers are really what make this movie fly. The above mentioned \\"All That Jazz\\" sets the tone for the entire movie by \\"out-Fosseing\\" the original. \\"We Both Reached For the Gun\\" took the original stage concept of the number one step further, resulting in not only an incredible musical highlight, (I'm not going to ruin it for you) but also an extremely accurate take on society today. \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" was jaw-dropping and \\"Cell Block Tango\\" actually moved me to tears. The biggest disappointment was the omission of \\"Class\\" (with Momma Morton and Velma)...Queen Latifah and Zeta-Jones would have really nailed it.  Maybe on the DVD release........<br />It's time Hollywood realizes that in order to make something work, you need to have people at the helm who know what they're doing.  Rob Marshall (\\"Cabaret\\" Revival) directed and choreographed \\"Chicago\\"...his concept for inserting musical numbers is flawless. His Broadway background and knowledge certainly saved this movie from the fate of \\"Evita\\" and \\"A Chorus Line\\".<br />I wanted to applaud after every number. What an awesome movie experience.

B000069AUI|4.0|This album does everything a great second album should do, namely take the band miles away from their starting point, &quot;Parachutes&quot; in Coldplay's case. The songs are much better realised and are more varied pace-wise, although I still have to laugh in disbelief at the reviews that call this &quot;an album on which Coldplay learned how to rock&quot;. True, there are some glimpses of aggression in the songs like &quot;Politik&quot; and &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, but Coldplay are still much more timid and mellow than U2 and Radiohead, the two bands they're most often compared with who don't exactly raaaaawk like AC/DC themselves. But that aside, every song here shimmers and screams with gorgeousness, especially the enchanting &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;In My Place&quot;, and a slinky &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face&quot;. Although it gets a teensy bit repetitive towards the end the first half of the album is overall damn near pefect.<br />My only complaint with the album is that, at some point, you could almost get tired of the melancholic, world-weary mode Chris Martin seems to be stuck in, and wish for him to maybe explore some other moods. But that really is a minor point compared to the pleasures of &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; offers.

B00005JKZ3|5.0|\\"Men In Black II\\" is just as good, if not better, than the original movie.  Most of the characters from the first film return to great effect.  Agent Jay (Will Smith) is having trouble finding a suitable partner after the retirement of Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones).  Agent Jay is eventually partnered up with Frank the Pug, the talking dog briefly seen in the first film.  The worms, seen in the coffee room in the first film, are also back.  We get to see them living it up in their swinging bachelor pad.  Lara Flynn Boyle plays Serleena, an alien who lands on earth and assumes the form of a Victoria's Secrets lingerie model.  She is an intergalactic dominatrix intent on destroying the earth.  The head of the MIB agency, Agent Zed (Rip Torn), decides that Agent Kay must be brought out of retirement to help thwart Serleena and her group of outlaw aliens.    Once Tommy Lee Jones' transformation from postmaster Kevin Brown back to Agent Kay is completed, the movie kicks into high gear.  He immediately intimidates Agent Jay into letting him drive the new company car.  The chemistry between the by-the-book veteran and his renegade partner is even more effective than in the original movie, now that they know each other so well.  The  plot twists multiply until the movie reaches it spectacular conclusion.  The special edition has a second disc which includes an alternate ending, behind the scenes footage and a hilarious blooper reel.
B00005JKG9|1.0|A complete waste of time - the point (if any) is made in 10 minutes and then rehashed over and over and over. So real estate sales people are lying cheating scum bags, which is nothing to make a whole movie about. Will the sequel be two hours of used car slalesmen swearing and lying to customers and each other?
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is my all time favorite. I absolutely love it. Guy pearce is a marvelous actor and i think the writing and whole idea of the movie is amazing. I may be 14 but this movie is # 1 in my books.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Recycle ..... Hmmmm   Thats the word I would use to disscribe 90% of the gags and jokes in Goldmember. Speaking as a person who loved the first two Austin Powers I have to say this movie fell REALLY short of the mark. While the movie does have it`s moments it just was not as creative as the first two movies. When you make a movie with too many recycled jokes it does two things  #1 It shows that the director is out of ideas and #2 it becomes a parody of the first two movies and it`s self.   On another subject . What is the deal  with this DVD ?  No captions and you can`t fast foward or rewind you can only skip to begining or end of each chapter (that stinks) Well thats about it Glad to see Fred Savage got some work .
B00005JLSC|5.0|The Movie \\"Chicago\\" was very much better than the stage play.  This was because the movies can produce such marvelous special effects.  Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zetweiler, and Richard Geer did their own dancing and singing.  They are beautiful, talented actors and held me spellbound throught the film.  The music was also wonderful.  The three people I went to see it with were equally impressed.  It was a sellout audience. Maybe this movie will encourage Hollywood to produce more musical, feel-good movies.  I certainly hope so.

B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah Carey's 1997 release, Butterfly, was the turning point of her career - music wise...and over the course of a few years, success wise. Since her self-titled 1990 debut, she had basically sung ballad after ballad with the exception of some up-tempo hits such as Emotions, Someday and Dreamlover. By the time this album was released, Mariah Carey had already shifted a staggering 94 million albums worldwide - this would be the album that pushed her sales over the all-important, Diva-essential 100 million mark. Unfortunately, Butterfly was the album where it all began to go a bit down for Mariah - why is it that when an artist gradually brings out better material, the sales begin to decrease? The Butterfly album sold 11 million copies worldwide and was seen as a bit of a flop. Despite this, it truly is a stunning lyrical and musical masterpiece - one Mariah should feel proud to be the producer of.<br /><br />Butterfly gets off to a flying start (excuse the pun) with the album's lead single Honey (10/10). A UK No.3 and US No.1 in the summer of 1997, the song is one of Mariah's greatest compositions to date and has a superb James Bond-style video to accompany it. The lyrics are not always clear on Honey, but the beats definitely are. Mariah gets help on Honey (not just on this version) from an army of top class R'n'B producers, such as Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs (P.Diddy now), Jermaine Dupri and Da Brat. The album's title track follows. Butterfly (9/10) is a wonderful ballad from Mariah with a slight hint of R'n'B. While lyrically superb, Mariah's vocals are not - she uses more breathy vocals on Butterfly rather than her soaring trademark voice...the one that made her the biggest selling female artist of the 1990's. My All (10/10) follows this and in spectacular style. Definitely one of Mariah's career highlights, My All was a UK No.4 and US No.1. This is a trademark ballad from Mariah in which she uses her stunning vocal range. The lyrics are very expressive and the emotion in Carey's voice is supreme. The Roof (10/10) and Fourth Of July (9/10) follow as tracks 4 and 5 respectively. The former is a highly-praised Mariah Carey classic. The beat is brilliant and is just pure \\"R'n'B Mariah\\" at her very best with a silky, velvety beat. The latter is a song that is hated by many people who review Butterfly. I can't see why - granted, the song isn't exactly the best on the album, but still has a great chorus. Breakdown (10/10) is another classic \\"R'n'B Mariah\\" song with soft vocals and a relaxing and chilled-out beat. Babydoll (10/10) is my favourite non-released song from Butterfly. Mariah's vocals on this superb R'n'B number are very light and the lyrics are hardly recognisable...but that's not the thing that makes this quite possibly one of Mariah Carey's greatest compositions of her entire career. I'm talking, of course, about that totally addictive and catchy bassline. The deep boom that follows in a certain arrangement is absolutely superb. Hear it and be hooked...<br /><br />Close My Eyes (10/10) and Whenever You Call (9/10) are up next. The former is definitely an album highlight. With its breathy and soothing vocals and mid-tempo beat, it makes for one hell of a song. The bassline is powerful and the lyrics are very professional. The latter is another superb song - excellent lyrics, excellent vocals (very \\"Vision Of Love\\" towards the end), excellent arrangement and excellent piano intro...'Nuff said! Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise) (8/10) is the next song. At just over 3 minutes, it could have just been an actual song, instead of a reprise! It starts off very mid-tempo, before breaking out into an up-tempo song with a brilliant dance beat. Remixed by David Morales, no one can deny this catchy beat. This said, it most definitely does not fit in with the rest of Butterfly and is probably the main reason it receives such criticism from other reviewers. The Beautiful Ones (8/10) is Mariah's sort-of \\"duet-type\\" thingy with Dru Hill. Although the way Mariah's vocals soar on this song, there's no way a certain Mr Sisqo can compete! Basically he just sounds like a background singer. Outside (9/10) is another brilliant mid-tempo ballad. The lyrics are about being accepted for who you are. Overall, a superb song that should've closed the album instead of the next two tracks. Honey (So So Def Radio Mix) Featuring Da Brat and JD (9/10) and Honey (Def Club Mix) (10/10) are the final two tracks on Butterfly. The former is a surprisingly good remix of Honey with a great rap from Jermaine Dupri. The latter is a brilliant club mix of Honey that goes on for more than 6 minutes. Although these last two remixes are brilliant, I really think they should've been left of Butterfly because they simply just do not suit the rest of the album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Butterfly is an absolutely superb and exceptional album from Mariah Carey. It received some great reviews critically, but not commercially - if only it had sold twice as many as the 11 million that it did. The follow-up to Butterfly was Rainbow - which was also superb, but no where near as creative and well-produced as Butterfly is. All in all, this is an essential Mariah Carey album for fans and a definite highlight of the 1990's.'s vocals soar on this song, there's no way a certain Mr Sisqo can compete!

B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah Carey's third studio album, Music Box, was released in 1993 at the peak of her career. Music Box is her biggest selling album to date, selling a whopping 25 million copies worldwide - 12.4 million in the US alone. Such sales are rare in the music world, but with Music Box they were rightly deserved. The three main singles from Music Box are Dreamlover, Hero and Without You and were undoubtedly the selling points of the album. While not my favourite Mariah Carey album (I wouldn't even put it in my Top 3), it's definitely one of the most listenable. Mariah wrote all the lyrics, except for the cover-version of Without You.<br />Music Box gets off to an excellent start with the summery and cheerful smash hit Dreamlover (10/10). This was released in August 1993 and peaked at No.9 in the UK - and was Mariah's 6th US No.1 single. The song was a welcome change from Mariah's typical power-ballads. Hero (10/10) is up next and is undoubtedly a career highlight for Mariah. Peaking at No.7 and No.1 in America, it is a firm favourite amongst many fans. Mariah's vocals are amazing, but it's the lyrics that make this song such a classic. Anytime You Need A Friend (10/10) is a superb gospel-style power ballad with some superb lyrics and soaring vocals. The song peaked at No.8 in the UK in June 1994 and is my favourite non-released song from Music Box. The album's title track, Music Box (9/10) is actually not as good as most people make it out to be. I like the beginning of the song that sounds like a music box (well duh!), but the rest of the song seems to drag. Now That I Know (10/10) is probably the most diverse song from the album. A pop song would sound out of place on Music Box, but this is pure 90's dance-pop at its best. \\"Now that I know that you want me for me I can be what you want - I can be what you need,\\" warbles Mariah to superb effect. The song sounds similar to Someday and is definitely an album highlight. Never Forget You (9/10) sees Mariah return to her trademark ballad crooning. The lyrics are superb and the instruments used on the song are put to optimum use.<br />Music Box continues in an awesome style with the brilliant ballad Without You (10/10). Released in February 1994, it became Mariah Carey's first-ever UK No.1 single - and rightly so. If there was ever a Mariah Carey song to be her first UK No.1 single, Without You is definitely it. This may be a cover version, but Mariah blows the original out of the water with ease. The song may be short, but makes a huge impression on Music Box on the whole. Just To Hold You Once Again (9/10) is another superb mid-tempo ballad that Mariah pulls off to amazing effect. This song is more of a sweeping ballad about how Mariah would \\"give her all\\" to hold her ex-lover once again. I've Been Thinking About You (10/10) is another album highlight. Mariah gets soulful and sultry with this brilliant up-tempo R'n'B number. The verses are almost silent, but the choruses are heavy with a deep bassline that just cannot be ignored. Up next is All I've Ever Wanted (10/10). This is another great ballad from Mariah that has a much more \\"epic\\" feel to it that most other ballads that Mariah sings. Her voice echoes on certain occasions that create this feeling of epic-ness. The final song from Music Box is Everything Fades Away (10/10). This is a superb mid-tempo ballad from Mariah, but has a rather interesting catchy vocal arrangement. For a ballad, this sounds rather strange but it's really isn't on this superb track to end a highlight album of the 1990's.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />Along with Daydream, Butterfly and the superb Charmbracelet, I consider Music Box one of Mariah Carey's best albums. Out of all eleven songs on Music Box, I rate eight of them with a 10/10, which is really saying something about the quality of this album. As Mariah Carey's biggest selling album - and one of the biggest selling female albums in history - Music Box is self-explanatory in why it is an essential recording for your collection.ecording for your collection.
B00006IUL6|4.0|This is a rare Robin Williams film that he doesn't make an appearance in the movie until very late. And is not a comedy. This I would say as a drama. If you are a fan of Robin Williams in a comedy movies (you may be disappointed to see that he is co-starring in a drama movie). Robin Williams plays an author. And Al Painco plays a cop that is handling a case of a 17 years old girl that was one of Walter Finch's (Robin Williams) fans. As the movie opens, Will Dormer (Al Pacino) arrives in Nightmute Alaska to cover a case of a murdered teenager (Crystal Lowe) and the local police has no idea who murdered the teeanger. But at a cabin in the fog, Will shoots and kills his partner ( Martin Donovan). And only one person knows who really killed Will's partner and that is Walter.
B00005JJX8|4.0|Hitchcock never made a movie in CinemaScope, in spite of the ignorance of others who have commented here about this DVD.  To Catch a Thief does not have an aspect ratio of 2.35 to 1, as another 'well-informed' reviewer commented.<br />The transfer is fine.  Though the source material could have been better chosen.  The featurettes are the typical celebration of the movie type.  Nothing too controversial is revealed, nor is it expected.  A running commentary like the one on the Sunset Boulevard DVD would have been nice.
B000002J1F|5.0|I really get [upset] when I go over to people's houses and I see THE BEST OF YES or YESSYEARS or whatever [cd] they bought just to get Roundabout.<br />If you like Roundabout, you need Fragile, because the rest of the record helps to explain why this overblown, ungainly example of early 1970's post Aquarian excesses became such a huge top 40 hit and AOR radio staple.<br />As a previous reviewer points out, it is because all of Fragile is very much a \\"team effort\\". Each of the musicians is equally responsible for their share of the album, be it their little \\"virtuoso solo segments\\" or the longer pieces like Roundabout and the album/CD's most important track, Heart of the Sunrise.<br />I call it \\"important\\" because it is Bill Bruford's one utter standout moment in Yes history. One of the comments he made when joining Bob Fripp in King Crimson was \\"Before I was the drummer with Yes. Now I'm Bill Bruford\\", and in the opening mellorton/snare drum barrage from Heart Of The Sunrise you can kind of tell why Fripp was interested. I think it is the most powerful moment on the \\"album\\" [I can't call it a CD ... I grew up with this thing on vinyl] and you can understand why later versions of Yes would stubbornly cling on to the song for their staple of live offerings.<br />But my favorite tracks from the album are three that most may not think of ... Sure, Steve Howe's Mood for A Day inspired me to no ends as a young guitar student and Long Distance Runaround remains a staple of FM radio ... but for me the truly mesmerizing tracks on this CD are John Anderson's We Have Heaven, Chris Squires' The Fish, and the vastly underrated South Side of The Sky.<br />We Have Heaven might at first glance sound like John Anderson being ... well, John Anderson, but listen closely. What you really have here is a pre Fripp and Eno tape loop piece that suggests something much grander than it's two minute and twenty something second running length; I could see this going on for a whole side of a [pardon me again] record, with the subtle little changes in wording and yelps of vocal building and building ... This track proves that Anderson wasn't just a vocalist, but an artist who just happened to sing in acapella.<br />The Fish [or Shinedeleria Whatevera] evokes a similar reaction. This is three and a half minutes of music that is all about building upon a literal base, and probably influenced me to take up the instrument as a youngster and demonstrate that most \\"bass players\\" weren't thinking about what they could do with their guitar, but were more concerned with hitting the right notes. Squires shows that not only could he hit the right notes, but that like a violin a bass guitar is capable of many different musical roles -- lead instrument, rhythm instrument, bottom, percussion device, and a great way to show how much you can groove with a waa waa pedal. South Side of the Sky is my favorite track from Fragile, but The Fish might be the most inventive.<br />And that nicely brings us to the South Side of the Sky ... Yes seems to be channeling several contemporary bands with this track: Crimson, Renaissance, Genesis, even ELP. Yet it is 100% Yes, and I would pay good money to hop into Dr. Who's TARDIS to go back to 1971 and see them attempt  to do it live. One of the truly engaging aspects of the track is that it is about the only time in Yes history that we hear Rick Wakeman play an actual grand piano [or at least the only example I care about]. His piano work recalls Keith Emerson but with more feeling, and whatever synthesizer he used for the \\"snowstorm\\" effects are downright cinematic when you wedge your head right between the speakers. If I bother to include a Yes track on mix tapes for friends it's usually South Side of the Sky, if that is any indication of my high opinion.<br />One the whole, though, this is a flawed album, but is the product of a band in transition. Other than his amazing organ playing on Roundabout, impeccable mellotron and grand piano playing, Rick Wakeman is given little to do, and plays the role of \\"newcomer\\" to the band to the point of blandness at times. He seems to be holding back, allowing  the previous members to have their way with the compositions and flavor them with the occasional organ flourish. And then there his annoying Cans and Brahms \\"virtuoso segment\\", one of the most unwelcomed mood killers ever put to classic rock acetate. The silver lining in this cloud is that Wakeman plays on Fragile as an equal amongst peers rather than a purple lighted Gandalf gowned demigod.<br />The other weakness in the CD is a lack of some form of unifying theme. These are almost mis-matched tracks, kind of like the Beatle's White Album, but with an actual percussion player. And what is the deal with Bruford's 5% For Nothing? Was that track included on the \\"album\\" just to annoy people or what?<br />But in the long run, as you hear Anderson sing \\"SHARP ... DISTANCE ...\\" at the end of the record it all falls into place, because after all this is Yes.<br />Who cares if it makes sense as long as it sounds great. A must have for any lover of classic 70's rock.no playing, Rick Wakeman is given little to do, and plays the role of \\"newcomer\\" to the band to the point of blandness at times.

B00004XQ83|5.0|Until the release of this soundtrack, most peopled gauged country music by the likes of Vince Gill, Clint Black, and all of the other modern country music deconstructionists.  These guys ain't country!  In terms of bluegrass, non-country folk typically eschew it as &quot;hokey.&quot;  Then this movie and soundtrack came out.<br />This is a wonderful collection of traditional bluegrass/early country music put together to introduce the non-bluegrass traditionalist to come and discover the wonderful sound of appalachia. Some of country/bluegrass music's best-known traditionalists are assembled on this album: Ralph Stanley, Gillian Welch, Alison Krauss, and Emmylou Harris.  <br />I highly recommend this to get a taste of music you may be discovering for the first time.  And no, the music on this CD does not sound like the horrid &quot;country music&quot; you hear on the radio. If you like this music, from here you may want to look at music CDs from artists that are an extension (or the originals) of this type of music:<br />* Nancy Griffith - (her music pre-1990; afterwards, she turned modernist and punky)<BR>* Iris DeMent - Infamous Angel CD<BR>* Little Jimmy Dickens<BR>* Patsy Cline<BR>* Flatt &amp; Scruggs<BR>* Bill Monroe<BR>* The Carter Family

B00005YW4H|4.0|My daughter introduced me to Norah Jones and I owe her one. Jones is remarkably assured for someone so young--her soft, smoky voice is always true, her piano work is simple, even elegant. My only quibble would be the sameness of the mood throughout the album, so that the original compositions tend to blur into one lengthy number, relieved by fine renditions of &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; the old Hank Williams classic, and a fine rendition of Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;The Nearness of You.&quot; It's hard to fault someone who has such an immense and distinctive talent; but it would be very nice to hear Jones do a few more of the old standards and offer a little more variety in her choices. That said, she's a dream of a singer/musician and this is a lovely CD.
0385508417|1.0|In &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; Grisham is totally unrealistic about how any normal person or community might react because one couple decide to go on a cruise.  The reaction of the community was, I thought, very mean spirited and totally lacking in the true meaning of Christmas. To not advise their daughter of their plans is also totally unrealistic. While this was a mildly pleasant &quot;read&quot; I found it predictable and  drawn-out.  Though a short book, I found myself wanting the author to get to the point. Even the ending does not make you feel that it is a community of which you would want to be a part. Skip &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; and reread Barbara Robinson's, &quot;The Best Christmas Pageant Ever&quot;
B00003CXSP|1.0|The only good thing about this film is Julianne Moore who always, always, gives everything she's got to any film in which she appears. She does a creditable follow-up as the alienated Clarice Starling in what is otherwise a deeply stupid film.<br />The screenplay gives only the merest nod to Thomas Harris's signal achievement in actually humanizing Hannibal in the book; in the film, Hopkins gives the same ridiculous, over-the-top performance he offered in Silence of the Lambs. Why he possesses an Academy Award for it will be forever beyond my comprehending. (If you want to see a truly alarming, deeply inhabited Hannibal, check out Manhunter--Michael Mann's ill-advisedly renamed Red Dragon--and see British actor Brian Cox do in only a few minutes what Hopkins cannot do in two full-length films: impart the true horror of evil personified, without bells and whistle but just sheer acting ability.)<br />For all the moody, European effect, this movie just doesn't happen. It comes alive when Moore is the focus. When it's Hopkins, it's all just gore, more gore and still more gore--pointlessly. Unlike the book, where the reasons are clear, in the film Hannibal is just a killing machine. Liotta also gives an over-the-top performance that lacks any hint of subtlety. The audience doesn't even get to enjoy the final scene as written by Harris; it's turned into an additional bit of meritless gore.<br />Don't bother with this one. Get Manhunter instead--which is truly the best film of a Harris book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I have never listened to jazz/blues kind of music before this CD came out. It was kind of by accident when I first heard this on the radio one morning. It is very soothing to listen to. Norah's voice does not fit the stereotypical dance-pop-top40 dime-a-dozen girly girly kind of sound you hear all the time across all radio stations. Norah's voice and sound is more mature as well as the lyrics/subject matter in the songs. Some people say it will put you to sleep - but not me. If you are in some kind of hurry when you listen to music then I would not recommend this to you. This CD is like a fine wine that needs to be savored not gulped.
B000005AYM|5.0|Where were you when Eryka Badu's lead single &quot;On and On&quot; dropped? I was in my car with the radio pumping. I never heard a style like that in my life. This entire album helped introduce a sound that is in a class of it's on now. Badu is the mother of the &quot;Neo-soul&quot; movement that is so popular today...
B00005JLRR|5.0|Star Trek Nemesis is honestlt the best Star Trek Movie I have ever seen from the best Stra Trek Tv Series: The Next Generation.  I have seen all of the Star Trek movies except the Search for Spock which I am sure ould not top this.  This movie is a rush of adrenaline for most of the movie.  In this movie aptain Picard is forced do battle with a clone that had been made of him from the plane of Rommulas he becomes warlord aftr he attacks the senate their which is about the only way he could be warlord because he is a Remen.  Anyway he invites Captain Picard for a visit to discuss peace, or so he says.  His clone however soon turns on him to capture him so he can destroy earth andfor anothe reason which I won't explain as it will spoil the rest of the movie. Their are plenty of subplots such as the wedding between #1 and DeAnna and Data's Broter B4 all in all this is a 5 start movie well woth the time of about two hours i reccommend it highly even if yo are not a star trek fan it is still very good.
B000002L68|5.0|Purple Rain Soundtrack is not just one of the best albums created but the best Movie Score of all time. The music is monumental and the vocals are flawless. Each songs serves a purpose and obtains it's ultimate goal.....make the listeners ..&quot;feel good&quot;
B00005JKG7|5.0|Building on his success from &quot;Halloween,&quot; Carpenter turns out an atmospheric, witty, genuinely scary film with &quot;The Fog.&quot;  It contains a cast of veteran actors, including Hal Holbrook and Janet Leigh, and actors then new to the genre, such as Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The film contains several in-jokes that may be of interest to movie buffs: Tom Atkins's character &quot;Nick Castle&quot; and Charles Cyphers's &quot;Dan O'Bannon&quot; are named after veteran directors of horror classics such as &quot;The House on Haunted Hill&quot; and &quot;Return of the Living Dead,&quot; respectively.  George &quot;Buck&quot; Flower's character is &quot;Tommy Wallace,&quot; who himself appeared in the film as one of the ghosts.  As for the film, the story about a colony of lepers trying to seek retribution for an act committed upon them 100 years before is a well done effort from everyone involved.  Holbrook gives a heartfelt, typically heavy handed performance as Father Malone, who finds his grandfather's journal in the walls of his church.  Tom Atkins is great as always as a sea merchant who picks up hitchhiker Jamie Lee Curtis just as the chaos begins.  Barbeau plays a deejay who broadcasts from a lighthouse, and who can spot the fog as it covers each street in order to guide Tom Atkins to the church.  She does a brilliant job of unwinding over the radio, as she pleas for someone to rescue her young son from the fog.  Janet Leigh and her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis later reteamed in &quot;Halloween: H20,&quot; which is worthy of mention to Curtis fans, or to anyone who thought the Michael Myers series had lost its touch.
0767819594|5.0|I first saw Cruel Intentions on tv. I didn't see the whole thing but it looked pretty good so I decided to rent it. The movie is very good and takes many twists and turns. I sometimes felt as if I would be able to predict what would happen next, but of course it didn't.<br />The movie starts out showing Sebastien (Ryan Phillipe) with a therapist. Sebastian talks about his so called former life where all he thought about was sex. He says he has changed but that is not true. I'll skip some unimportant stuff and go on.<br />He goes home where his stepsister Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is talking to Cecile's mother. Cecile is a girl who will be attending Kathryn and Ryan's school next year. Afterwards, Kathryn wants to destroy Cecile's reputation because Cecile dated her ex-boyfriend. Kathryn wants Sebastian to seduce Cecile to enhance his reputation. Sebastian is known for sleeping with tons of girls.<br />Sebastian would rather sleep with the new headmaster's daughter, Annette (Reese Witherspoon) who writes articles about how she is a virgin and plans to wait. Kathryn and Sebastian make a bet. If Sebatian can't bed Annette, Kathryn gets his car. If Sebastian wins, he gets Kathryn.<br />The movie goes on from there with Sebastian falling for Annette and Kathryn trying hard to destroy Cecile. Overall, a very good movie worth watching but NOT for the kids. Trust me on that one.
B000002WPI|5.0|Now days, hip hop is being destroyed by pop rappers who can't rap or flow, and it's sad 2 see, cuz hip hop was great, but now new rappers are making it sad.  Wu-Tang are one of the few rappers keepin it real nowdays, but the 36 chambers is irreplaceble classic of 12 superb songs that never get old.  My favorites are Bring da Ruckas, Shame on a n****, Clan in the front, can it be all so simple, Da mystery of chessboxin, C.R.E.A.M., Method Man, Protect your neck, and TEARZ.  This is one of hip hop's best collections, and it's good ol' classic ruged and raw Wu-Tang flavor.  This is one of the good ol' school albums that show what hip hop should be.
B00005JLRR|5.0|After anticipating the release of Nemesis for more than a year, and then reading what critics had to say about this film (which was a lot of negative), I went into the theatre with excitment yet dissapointment.  When I came out, it was all excitement.  The story in Nemesis was not very strong, but the action in this movie blew me away - if you like what Star Trek is famous for, which is huge ship to ship battles in space, this movie has one of the best ever.  As for the actual story, it's all about Picard vs. his younger clone, Shinzon.  I think Shinzon has a weak intro in the movie (if he is to be presented as a great villan) but as the movie progresses, he looks and acts more aggressive. I love the Remans also, especially Shinzon's viceroy (Ron Pearlman).  He has this deep, dark voice and a way of getting into other people's minds and tormenting them.  If you would like to compare this to any other Trek movie, this is the best ever for special effects and the ship battles.  As for story and best villan, that it is not.  Star Trek II is always going to be the best, no matter what.  It really is impossible to beat a classic.  But Nemesis is the best TNG movie after First Contact.  If you want a story that makes you think and is interesting, this probably isnt it but if you want to relax and not think about the movie but just enjoy what it has to offer, you really need to see Nemesis.
B000002B1M|4.0|This album is still the real nas, but he sampled a guitar for the message, and Pac's &quot;All eyez on me&quot; for &quot;Street Dreams&quot;, but don't get me wrong, he's still a great lyricis in this album, but so-so, and sampled beats are not what I had in mind.  If I ruled the world, is the best Nas song to date.  But then when I brought this, I was thinking, I didn't pay 18 bux jes 2 hear 1 good song.  Then I started to listen to this for the lyrics, then it grew on me, just like that.  If u wanna hear Nas at his best, I recomend Illmatic, this, Stillmatic, and God's son.
0385508417|3.0|Any fan of Grisham's legal thrillers might be disappointed by this, but if you are looking for a sentimental holiday book, you might enjoy &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;  It is sappy and predictable, but the mesaage is a valid one--to remember the true meaning of Christmas and cherish family and friends.  It's a cute story and is a quick read, so borrow it from a friend.

B000001FG5|5.0|This is a great Sturday Night Fever follow-up album. The trio of hits (Tragedy, Too Much Heaven, Love You Inside Out) is the best trio on any of the BeeGees albums. Plus the rest of the album doesn't have much of a variety, but the songs are just what the BeeGees are about. Reaching Out and Living Together are very very awesome and the BeeGees &quot;non-hits&quot; are just what these aongs are about. Theres also the catchy I'm Satisfied and the &quot;Brick Houselike&quot; Search, Find. Although this song is way better beated and has a better verse. Spirits Having Flown is sort of a catchy preview to 1993s's Size Isn't Everything. The &quot;long for nothing&quot; Stop, Think Again is okay in its own way. The only dull song on the album is fortunately the shortest, Until. The solo efforts of Barry are horrible and cause nothing but boring chaos. But still, great follow-up of the greatest selling soundtrack in history that made the BeeGees very well known.
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie was so much better than FOTR.  At least a whole star's worth!  There is more emotion, and more concentration is dedicated to the individual characters.<br />Yes, Peter Jackson changed some things from the book, a lot of things; but, generally speaking, I think he enhanced the movie.<br />Sure, he added Arwen where she shouldn't have been, but being so little of a three-hour movie it's not as bad as it could have been.  Besides, did she really affect anything?<br />And, yes, little things along the way, including the Ent's reluctance to fight, were not as good as they could have been.  Yet, nothing's perfect [And I wish people would stop calling me nothing! : )] and Jackson did do a good job on the important parts.  Cut him some slack, will ya?<br />However, I do agree that Faramir should not have been so like Boromir.  That was one of the things I liked about the book -- that Faramir could sit down and be reasonable.  That he could learn from his brother's shortcomings.  Taking Frodo and Sam hostage -- and all the way into Gondor -- was just too much.  Well, too much if you want the book on screen.  For a separate story... it wasn't that bad a decision.  It did let you see Frodo succumbing more to the ring, anyway.  You wouldn't have seen so much a change in Frodo from his possession of the ring if this scene had not been added.  So it did have its good parts.<br />I almost forgot Gollum!  He was so lifelike!<br />But another mistake, if you can call it that, on Peter Jackson's part, was that he did not let Frodo even attempt to explain to Gollum why he \\"betrays\\" him later in the movie.  Of course Gollum does not understand!  More time should definitely have been devoted to this, or at least a reason why not.<br />All taken into account, I think this movie had a better feel to it than FOTR -- more REAL.  I appreciated there not being so many kooky camera angles as in the first movie.
B000050IE6|4.0|Well, hit with another stellar album from these guys.  I'd like to mention Opeth has progressed incredibly with each album.  What they lacked in structure and flow with albums such as Orchid and Morningrise, is no longer apparent with Still Life.  Everything on this album flows pretty well, aside from some shoddy production.  The lyrics are highly poetic and the vocals are incredible.  Mikael Arkfeldt definitely has one of the most hypnotizing voices I've heard.  Unfortunately, flaws do exist.  First of all, Opeth's tendency to draw things out is once again present.  Long songs are not necessarily bad, but with this album, Opeth takes too long to make a statement.  Aside from that, the bass parts are lacking (at least in comparison to Morningrise), and Benighted is quite possibly one of the worst Opeth songs I've heard.  For a treat, I recommend &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; (Killer riffs in this tune) and &quot;White Cluster&quot;.  I'd also like to mention Opeth is not for everyone.
0385508417|5.0|I loved this book, I think my new tradition will be to read this book and watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation!  The two together have me laughing hysterically.  I really liked Luther and Nora and can imagine them being my next door neighbor.  They were two people that had done the Christmas thing year after year and wanted something different.  Everyone wants that, but this year it backfired.  Everything was so classic, the office party, the calendar and fruitcake sales, the shopping, the food and the tree.  Luther handled it all so well.  However, when it all boils down, Christmas is all about family, friends and holiday cheer.  Totally enjoyable book.
B00005LMWI|3.0|Kamelot has only improved with each record, and i can say that this is their best.  Overall, it's well conceived and fairly complicated (folks, the guitarist does not make the band).  The only song that I can say was nearly perfect (for me at least) was the title track &quot;Karma&quot;.  In general, the other tracks lack a certain &quot;catchy-ness&quot; that is indeed important in all music.  Lyrics are the only real cliqued and bland part of this band.  &quot;Power&quot; metal bands need to do something a little more diverse and creative with their lyrics.  Which brings the point, that you can't help feeling you've heard this before...and the truth..you probably have.  Kamelot may have improved with this album, but it's nowhere near what I  know they can do.
B00005JLD2|5.0|The shameful story at the core of \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" is not a new one and can be traced back many thousands of years: the pilgrims and subsequent settlers of what was to become the USA decimating the Native Americans of Northern America and the Spanish Conquistadors who conquered and decimated the Aztecs and other Indian Nations of Mexico and South America all in the name of bringing an unwanted civilizing effect on these \\"natives.\\"<br />The English settled Australia primarily as a penal colony but when towns began to be form, they felt it necessary to bring about the \\"civilizing\\" of the Aborigines peoples of Australia as they attempted to stamp out the native language and religion.<br />The specific story of \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" is true and involves the extremely sad yet life affirming journey of Molly and Daisy (Everlyn Sampi and Tianna Sansbury), two half caste girls, who are placed in a school to basically teach them how not to be Aborigine girls and to work in British factories and thereby be accepted by proper British society. The fences of the title are those that ran almost the full length of Australia in an attempt to stamp out a problem involved with the over population of rabbits that plagued Australia in the 1930's.<br />There is a particularly horrendous scene involving Mr. Neville (Kenneth Branagh), whom the Aborigines call \\"Mr. Devil,\\" who talks to a group of women about how the Australian Government hopes to rid Australia of Aborigines through the use of inter-breeding with Caucasians:<br />\\"All it takes is three generations to accomplish,\\" he says with a self-satisfied smile on his face. Disgusting.<br />Molly and Daisy and at first Gracie (who is captured) have very strong ties to their mothers who seem to be guiding them home...some 1800 miles away from the school.  Daisy and Molly are guided by more than a knowledge of the land and of tracking in particular but by the mystical nature of love: there is a magical scene in which Molly's Mother has her hand on the fence 1800 miles away from Molly who also has her hand on the fence and you can tell that they can \\"feel\\" each other.<br />Much of \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" reminds me Peter Weir's \\"The Last Wave\\" another film with the strong reverberations of another world, another level of reality. In fact, David Gulpilil so persuasive and effective in \\"The Last Wave,\\" plays a tracker hired by the authorities to find the runaways.<br />\\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" is a simple story, told extremely well. If it changes the thinking of merely one person so inclined...it will have served its purpose.on the fence 1800 miles away from Molly who also has her hand on the fence and you can tell that they can \\"feel\\" each other.<BR>Much of \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\" reminds me Peter Weir's \\"The Last Wave\\" another film with the strong reverberations of another world, another level of reality.

B000062Y98|2.0|First of all, This is NOT Blind Guardian.  Most people get the impression from &quot;nightfall....&quot; that Blind Guardian is a big, bombastic band.  Very untrue for any fan who has heard earlier material (&quot;follow the blind&quot;, &quot;battalions of fear&quot;, &quot;tales from the twilight world&quot;).  What we have always cared about was the uniqueness of Hansi's voice and the insane soloing (which really isn't that difficult).  BG has always been a &quot;fun&quot; band with some really emotional stuff.  Well now that is gone, the bombastic choruses on thsi album destroy any uniqueness in Hansi's voice.  The solos are what we've heard on every other Blind Guardian album and the lyrics are strangely silly....Nothing memorable on this album, this album only gets two stars because of &quot;precious jerusalem&quot;.  This was the only tune worth listening to...
B00006CXSS|1.0|This is the best movie/miniseries I have ever seen.  Attention to detail and historical accuracy is the key for me.
0790731479|2.0|Just to let you know, this movie is one of my personal favorite ghost movies. That said, I feel I need to tell you some details about this terrible DVD. The packaging is fine, nothing great, but it works. The picture and sound quality are good and make it a good cinematic experience. However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on AFI's top 100 funniest movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD than this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<br />This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched! Personally, I think fullscreen is for idiots who think they're getting the whole picture when they're not. You people put no actual thought into making DVDs, you just slap some crap together and think its fine. No, it's not fine! Clean up your acts!
0066214122|5.0|The premise of this book is both fantastically interesting, yet phenomenally disturbing! <br />The read was fast-paced &amp; the technological aspects were easy to follow...I could not put this book down. <br />Crichton's mixture of cutting edge nanotechnology as it relates to practical uses is astounding. The mishap/extinction issue of humans is real &amp; is currently being discussed by our government!<br />EVERYONE with a shred of interest in the future of technology and of the human race should read this book! I also recommend reading the Bill Joy essay from WIRED magazine of April 2000, included in Crichton's bibliography.
0316666343|1.0|The Lovely Bones is not the sort of novel that I usually read; I prefer books that either scare me half to death, or keep me laughing out loud. That said, I enjoyed, and found comfort in, the premise. I want to believe that, even if something horrible happens to me on earth, heaven will be life as I wish it. Readers embrace The Lovely Bones because it reassures us that Reverend So-and-So is right: unless we're flat out evil,we'll have eternal life.<br />The overall feel of the book trumps the storyline, however I do have two specific comments. First, I liked it that the killer's fate wasn't what I expected. Second, the Ruth out of body/sex scene confused me. I don't care about these things, because every once in a while, all I want is a pat answer to a weighty question.  The Lovely Bones delivers.
B00005M91K|2.0|Sorry, but I see this film not as a unique new view of the world, nor a unique way of filming the world, making a statement, etc. <br />This is really just a Koyaanisqatsi/Powasqatsi wannabe. <br />The film looks like it was made in the same locations, many of the camera angles are the same, even the dump scenes are virtually identical. True there are some very unique perspectives, but overall the degree of similarity makes this very nearly plagaristic.<br />Do yourself a favor. Buy Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi. Rent Baraka if you want to see it, but save your $$ for the \\"real McCoy.\\"

Dissident (my favorite song on album) is the kind of song that you can listen to time and time again without losing interest.

B00005B36H|2.0|This is your typical Tool album. Tool is quite possibly the most overhyped/overrated band since Nirvana. The have a good vocalist, and write excellent lyrics but the music overall...well it just fails. They've been around for over a decade and haven't really altered their supposed &quot;genre-redefining&quot; sound. It's all the same, the quiet to harsh vocal stylings, the percussive guitar/bass playing, the only thing that changed is the drumming which sometimes can get pretty interesting. Tool's typical flaws are here as well. The redudant, often mundane guitar playing, the samey-sounding songs, the 2 or 3 weak tracks that really have no purpose...Tool too often borders the line between mood setting music and boring filler BS. If you want a band that reaches the deep, mind-blowing experience Tool tries to do, try Neurosis.
0316666343|5.0|I spent the past three days with my nose in this book. It was a very touching story of a girl who was raped then murdered by her neighbor.

0793518326|5.0|This book is probably the best buy I have ever made. It was in Austin, TX in March 1995, I was almost 40. I did not believe that that was possible. I cannot play by ear, and by the time I bought the book I had had quite a lot of different Beatles music books. They all were given to my friends right away, as this one is really &quot;complete&quot;. It does have several typos, but they do not make it less worthy.<BR>I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in The Beatles music, no matter whether one is a beginner, or a proficient musician.

B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is so awesome.  From the jokingly explicit look at advertising prevalent in the first song, Chic N Stu, to the finishing track Streamline...this album is just amazing.  My favorite track is Roulette.  It just speaks to me and should be the next single.  But System can do no wrong.  They address political decadence in only a manner that Rage did it, only...they do it so much better.  Don't think they are copying for they were always as political (see War? from their first album).  System is a force to be reckoned with.  They are one of the best rock bands we have now...this CD is affirmation of such.  You must get this album, it's amazing.  <br />Other stand out tracks include: Innervision, Bubbles, Ego Brain, Mr. Jack, and Streamline...but it's a gem...it's all good.  BUY IT.

B000MX7V5M|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock once dismissed \\"To Catch a Thief\\" as a lightweight diversion, yet it remains an important work in several respects. Hitchcock made the picture in 1954 during one of his most prolific periods. The filmmaker's energy is evident in the vividness of the Riviera cinematography (by Oscar winner Robert Burks) and imaginative use of the newly developed VistaVision process. Cary Grant and Grace Kelly deliver stunningly cool performances - the carnal nature of their characters' romance (as well as the unmentioned difference in age) adds to the overall lasciviousness. The film also should be credited for its underlining theme of \\"sex as larceny,\\" a recurring motif in later Hitchcock works such as \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Marnie.\\" Though not terribly suspenseful, \\"To Catch a Thief\\" ranks among Hitchcock's most elegant achievements.
B00005JKES|1.0|Before you assume that I am going to complain about the omission of the pilot, I'm not.<br />What I want to remind everyone of before they rush to buy season 1 on DVD, is what happened when the VHS releases came out....<br />Season 1 was released on VHS, then later the complete series (seasons 1 &amp; 2) was released in a boxed set. So anyone who had bought season 1 had to buy it again in the complete set.<br />How do we know that won't happen with the DVD release? Why buy season 1 if they are going to release it with season 2 in a complete set?<br />Again I say, BEWARE! Unless you have money to burn... I'd wait!

B00000JGEN|3.0|The world of the next few years will very much be like the world we live in today.  Director Paul Michael Glaser in THE RUNNING MAN posits a economically blighted society that depends on consumer spending to keep it afloat, and television ratings is the means to do that.  A hit television show called 'The Running Man' features convicted criminals running for their lives to avoid a series of weirdly garbed pursuers called Stalkers who always kill them in spectacular ways guaranteed to garner high ratings.  This kind of show is what in our time is called a 'reality' show, a hybrid of THE GONG SHOW, SURVIVOR, and FEAR FACTOR.  Ironically enough, when THE RUNNING MAN was first released in 1987, there were no reality shows.  Director Glaser with amazing foresight merely carried the then trend of borderline idiotic quiz shows, many of which were hosted by Richard Dawson, who as Killian, emerges as the dramatic center of this movie.  It is he, rather than the titular star, Arnold Schwarznegger, who steals the limelight.  Killian is the host of a game show that panders to the mindless spending habits of the American public.  Apparently, by the year 2017, the constitutional protections of the Bill of Rights have been eroded sufficiently to allow on-air executions of the condemned.  Killian is filthy, loud, abrasive, self-serving, but that is the point.  By the movie's end, when he and Arnold have their inevitable confrontation, Killian tries to justify his role by claiming that he merely gives what the public had been wanting anyway, a means for a brainless audience to want their minds put into neutral and watch human beings sliced and diced just before a cut to a commercial.  Arnold, of course, represents the call to decency and gives Killian a taste of his own medicine.  The problem with this is that Killian is right.  The cultural deck has long since been stacked against the kind of decency that would have seen through the viciousness of a show of the ilk of THE RUNNING MAN.  Merely eliminating Killian might make contemporary audiences feel that a sense of normalcy has returned, but to the audience of THE RUNNING MAN, another cut to a commercial is all that would have been required to send a call to the bullpen for another loathesome host who would make Killian seem sainted.<br />THE RUNNING MAN is a troubling movie, not in any technical sense, since after all it is a Arnold movie which mandates body counts, explosions, startling special effects, stellar supporting actors (Jesse Ventura and Maria Conchita Alonso shine), and Arnold's penchant for throwing out quips and puns as he decimates yet another villain.  The problem with THE RUNNING MAN is that as a satire of quiz shows and moronic audiences, it works only too well.  The concluding kiss that Arnold plants on Maria Conchita Alonso's lips does not go far enough to make the viewer feel that the slime of a debased and debauched television culture can ever be wiped clean.  It is not often that a movie that tries so hard to be entertaining instead morphs into a film that makes this audience think even while trying its best to make the audience-in-the-film not to think at all.
B00005JL78|5.0|Just a year ago or so, I was wondering if Spielberg could still direct. He had been producer of so many films, some of which he had hardly anything to do with, that I wondered if he still had it. This movie shows that he does. Some imperfections and a little long, but generally a very good show. Some of the ideas and effects seem derived from &quot;The Matrix&quot;, but in a good way and not too obvious. A good cross between action, drama and suspense and worth viewing.
B00000IOSU|5.0|great live cd with some of the best songs yet from sarah.  you really get the feeling that you're at one of her concerts with this album.  5 stars...
0792165020|4.0|Enticing plot. Matt Damon is convincing as a charming manipulative psychopath.  GORGEOUS backdrop. I'd watch the movie just to fall in love with the beautiful scenery all over again. The soundtrack is great too, particularly that one song where Jude Law was performing with the rest of the band in the movie.
0140143505|5.0|Admit it or not, we all like to read other people's mail.  This wonderfully charming book of letters between a New York book lover and a London book seller is like a perfectly wrapped exquisite little gift.  It's so brief you can easily read it in one short sitting, but it's so intimate, funny and warm I can guarantee you'll read it over and over.
B00005YUNY|5.0|A &quot;holy freakin buttkickin wonderful awsome once in a lifetime peak performance on &quot;ritual&quot;, jeezzzuuus-h-christ. <BR>    Much of this DVD will remind you of a usual (above average Yes performance) until you see/hear what they have done on &quot;Ritual&quot;. Most symphonic concerts re-hash studio stuff and drown out the orchestra anyway, but here the stellar performances by the Yes members is really enhanced. I'm a huge Steve Howe fan, but it was John Anderson's killer vocal sound in this cut that makes it unforgettable. The Poet-Singer is captured in all his glory on ritual, framed by the usual impecable musicianship of the other band members. A top shelf DVD even for this one song. highly recomended for people that remember when music wasn't all about Top 40!
B00006F7S4|5.0|It's easy to write off this cd as just depressing and dull with the first listen, but once you actually listen to it, I mean sit down and really listen to it, the simplistic beauty of this cd comes to you.<br />His breakup with longtime girlfriend may have been horribly rough on him emotionally, but it seems to be the best thing that has happened to him musically. He still sings in his droll, monotone tones, but there's something behind it now, emotion. <br />This cd also has some of the most bare lyrics from Beck I've seen. He still goes into his metaphors in some of the songs, but he isn't hiding a lot on this album.  It's very open and elegant, and it shows a maturation in the musician. <br />I highly recommend this album, it's a solid, consistent album with soulful lyrics and incredible music.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I bought the album thinking it would be tremendously fantastic.  But I also bought The White Stripes &quot;De Stijl&quot; and listened to IT first.  A bunch of New York kids who sat around and drank...played in a band and then got a break.  Wow, great.  If you compare The Strokes to any other rock band out there at this time, you'll see that they are just a sugary sweet type of music that's just there to pull kids into the new movement.  This is the band that will replace pop and will get big...but there are still other bands that are SO much better than this group.  It reminds me of The Cars...only they're 20 years later.  I'm not impressed by The Strokes.  If you want a good rock band that will deliver GOOD rock music....look for The White Stripes, or even better, Queens of the Stone Age.
B00000IP4H|5.0|I got into Testament in their 2nd album, \\"The New Order,\\" and sort of followed up until \\"Souls of Black.\\"  I then kinda lost touch with them, until they released \\"Low.\\"  I was very impressed, especially by the parts where Chuck was using a much rougher voice. I loved the way he sounded, and the music was more aggressive, so it definitely matched. But, when I heard \\"Demonic,\\" it was as if they had decided to fulfill my every wish! The sound got even more aggressive and heavy, and Chuck is using his rough, death-metal style vocals almost all the time throughout! I love it! Yes, it is a headbanging wet dream. First two songs are monstrously heavy and powerful, and the rest (except maybe \\"Nostrovia\\") are not weak at all. To the naysayers, shut up! Testament doesn't have to limit themselves to plain old thrash always. Come on. Unfortunately, while \\"The Gathering\\" is a strong album, I missed the rough vocals. To me, Testament's first 2 albums,plus \\"Low\\", and \\"Demonic\\" are their best. I always love it when a band pushes its own limits to the breaking point. Sometimes it doesn't work. But, in Testament's case, it did work.  I hope their next one emphasizes death vocals a lot more than their last cd. I think it makes for a much more powerful experience. Crushing, definitely crushing music.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Finally.  For all of you, like me, who have been waiting for a rock album that doesn't sound like kid-bop.  This bizkit isn't limp, it's not an annoying puddle of mud, and you won't want your nickle back.  This is real rock.  While all this commercial, childish &quot;rock n roll&quot; has filled our airways, we've waited.  Patiently wishing for the return of that REAL sound, that REAL skill, knowing that it may never come back.  Well it has.  This album rocks HARD with FANTASTIC bass rifs, skilled lead and great vocals.  This is a job well done, 5 STARS!
B000000Y87|5.0|These live performances offer us an intimate glimpse into the greatest, most innovative Jazz trio ever. Bill Evan's subtle touch, pristine sound and eloquent expressiveness. Paul Motian's steady and tasty timekeeping. And, last, but certainly not least, Scott LaFaro's mind-bending bass virtuosity. The year is 1960 and this man is playing the acoustic bass with the ease and fluidity of any horn player before or since. What Jimmy Blanton did first, and what was being developed by Oscar Pettiford and Ray Brown, Scott took to unprecedented levels of artistry and virtuosity. But, as great as he was, it was the interaction between the three, especially between him and Bill, what is truly mesmerizing. Yet, because the music is overall of the slow to slow-mid tempo variety, and the mood is generally mellow, almost romantic, to a layman it would not sound overtly unusual - just a piano trio, right? Wrong. Listen deep, and you will hear musicians that seem to be connected by some cosmic force, communicating in a higher level of consciousness experienced only by a precious few. Sadly, Scott passed away soon after these sessions. What a loss. We will never know how far he would have gone. But judging by these performances, what lay ahead was bound to annihilate every pre-conception, every pre-determined role in music. It was bound to be explosive. We will never know. But get this, and revel in the glowing artistry of these three masters.
B00005JL2O|5.0|As always Mike Myers is great.  The movie was well done.  It will be one that we enjoy watching over many times for a crazy laughs.
B00007BH5C|4.0|I like this album mostly the same as the last one, since it, of course, revisits the old themes of the first soundtrack. But I admire the slight change that has taken place in these old themes. They seem to have been twisted into darker and more melancholy melodies, which I love. I especially like &quot;Gollum's Song.&quot; I heard this song previous to buying the album, and I mistook the singer for Bjork! I still think that the theme used in both &quot;Samwise The Brave&quot; and &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; from the first album is the best part of the entire movement, but all in all, yet again, Howard Shore has produced quite an astonishing and beautiful score.
6300268470|4.0|Edit out the Angie Dickinson scenes,<br /> and this would be a 10 star.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Just because there are 600 and something reviews, I give you my opinion. I shall say that this is one of the worst most over hyped piece of (enter profanity) un-creative releases thats ever entered my possesion.  What is wrong with you people? Why support this? These are our new generation artsy musical saviors??  Mabey you need to look a little harder for it.  Its out there,  just listen a little closer next time.  Oh yeah, don't forget to turn off MTV at night when you fall asleep before it starts a vacuum secretly sucking any last bit of creativity outta your soul.  Sweet Dreams!   Here's a suggestion for the self directed amoung us:  The Dismemberment Plan.  Start there.  Maybe you'll hear immortality.
B00006CXXU|5.0|\\"STRIPPED\\" is the best cd in the last few years.  Her voice her presence, her sensuality, her confidence!! She is great.  She is also a wonderful singer she does not get the respect she deserves for her \\"voice!\\"  \\"Walk Away\\" is one of my favorite songs.  Her voice is so powerful and she sounds so bluesy and you can feel the pain.  \\"Fighter\\" is a rockish track that puts Christina in a different light, another great track.  \\"Loving me for me\\" could have been easily been down by Jill Scott or Erykah Badu\\".  She sounds so soulful and her voice, need I say more.  \\"Impossible\\" w/ Alicia Keyes is a soulful bluesy song.  This song is cousins with \\"Walk Away\\" hearing Impossible i can picture C.A. on a stage black and white just belting her heart out.  \\"Beautiful\\" is exactly what it is! She is so confident and reassuring and she definitely puts it all into this track.  Should be will be #1! \\"Cruz\\" is a get away song, leaving everything.  \\"Make Over\\" sounds like something from Courtney Love very nice!! \\"Soar\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\" are great tracks, her voice is definitely on point with these Celine Dion-ballads.  \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" and \\"Dirrty\\" are her sexually charged songs.  Great dance tracks.  \\"I'm Okay\\" is the most vulnerable part of the album where Christina addresses her sbusive father.  And \\"Stripped\\" closes out with the powerful \\"Keep on singing my song\\" very nice and passionate.  Christina is one of my fave artists.  She is great and I hope this cd overshadows her great... teenybopper-persona.  She is a beautiful woman who knows what she wants.

0783229321|5.0|people who rated a 1 star must have been watching a different movie. thats all i can think. this movie is a CLASSIC comedy. American Pie is not funny.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth was a movie that redefined the world of fantasy.  <br />Jennifer Connelly did a superb job!  David Bowie was incredible!<br />I loved the plot of the movie and I loved Sarah's travels through the the labyrinth and the many creatures (Hoggle, Ludo, Sir Didymus, the &quot;Chilly Down&quot; gang, and the many goblins) were all really cool.<br />Major props to the creative talents of George Lucas and Jim Henson.  <br />Watching this movie makes me go back to when I was little and my sister and I were singing along to all the songs like &quot;Magic Dance&quot; and &quot;Chilly Down.&quot; <br />This is a wonderful film with a great story and I proudly recommend it for anyone!
B00000I8BX|4.0|Fear Factory did a great job with this album and I would recommend it to anyone who likes metal.<br />Vocals: The primary vocals are great.The backup ones are not near as good, but still decent.<br />Guitars: Good job, strong and loud.<br />Bass: A little repetitive, but flows and sounds exceptionally well with the rest of the album.<br />Drums: Somewhat basic at times but works very well.<br />The bonus songs aren't anything great, but I would recommend getting them anyway.<br />My favorite songs are Edgecrusher, Shock, and Obsolete.
B00006IUL6|2.0|After seeing the masterpiece &quot;Memento&quot; and the highly interesting &quot;Following&quot; from Chris Nolan, I expected so much.  What I got was incredibly disappointing.  The movie is not unwatchable, but if Memento was a &quot;10&quot; on the originality scale, this turkey was a &quot;1.&quot;  I won't spoil the plot (actually, there is nothing of note to spoil anyway)... but this is a tired &quot;nearly good cop chases bad guy, bad guy catches on to cop's Achille's heel, and cop must deal with being compromised&quot; kinda flick.<br />Lacking action, this is a talky thriller that could bore the pants off you.  Only one scene with Pacino chasing Williams over a log-jammed stream was interesting.  Everything else seemed like a bad rerun.<br />Robin Williams did do a good job of acting, and I agree that Hillary Swank's performance was top notch...but this was not enough to save the movie.  After 5 minutes of watching the disheveled, sleepless Al Pacino, I was thinking the movie would have been more watchable with anyone else. (Was Guy Pierce busy?)  For being an insomniac, Pacino sleptwalked through this role.  But even good acting can never overcome a mediocre story, and that's what you're in for, my friends.<br />If you feel tempted to get this, do yourself a favor and get Pacino's &quot;Sea of Love&quot; instead.  Perhaps Chris Nolan should have watched this one first, to see how this kind of movie could have been made, and what sort of compelling performance Pacino can deliver with the right material.
B00002E23E|5.0|for any zep fan,<br />this video takes you to new heights in zep musical and lyrical innovation.  every song they perform gets an unusual, unbelievable treatment and live-only touch that will make you love all your zep favorites even more, and adore those tunes you may not have gotten hooked to before.  best are no quarter, rain song, since i've been loving you, and moby dick.  dazed and confused takes you through about a twenty minute thrill, while they go bold with whole lotta love shifts to really take it up a notch.<br />every zep fan could only be blessed to own this video of the zep new york performances and the embedded mock rock saxon pagan music videos they reveal, and remember, these are the images that actually inspired the movie spinal tap.
B000067CPX|4.0|Ok, so it's not as good as Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but this is definantly a great CD. The RHCP continue to advance their musicianship with their new CD, By The Way. Talk about a total turn-around, The Chili Peppers go from funky rock and roll to mellow, laid back rock. The CD flows through 16 of their most musical and most poetic songs they've done yet. Although some songs, like Can't Stop, return to their original style, most of the songs are soothing and relaxing. There's not many bad songs on the CD. Most RHCP fans will enjoy this album, and I highly recommend this album.
B00004WG2X|5.0|As an avid Austen fan, I can truthfully say that this adaptation is, by far, the most faithful to the book.  This BBC version has captured the spirit of Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, as well as the other characters.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Deep Space Nine is an utter masterpiece. The characters are well thought out and extremely complex, the setting is alien and intriguing, the episodes are well written and thought provoking.<BR>I highly recomend the first season. It includes great episodes liuke Emissary, the best premier a Star Trek series has ever had, Duet, an intriguing and emotional inquiry on Nazi-esque war crimes, and In the Hands of the Prophets, an episode that looks at the debate between religion and secularism while haveing an exciting political story at the very same time.<BR>Season one of Deep Space Nine is just a glimps into what Star Trek is really about, the exploration of the human condition...
B000024D4R|5.0|This album is a perfect example of Roger Waters's excellent songwriting.  This album is conceptually, lyrically, and musically brilliant. Many have made an association between this album and George Orwell's brilliant novels (especially Animal Farm).  Waters's concept was actually the flip side of Orwell's intentions.  Waters instead condemns the cupidity of capitalism.<BR> <BR>Musically, the band member who really shines is David Gilmour.  Unlike many of his stale, manufactured guitar solos, Gilmour gives vivid guitar licks throughout the album.  Wright's keyboarding fits the mood perfectly (especially on \\"Dogs\\"). Mason and Waters provide confident percussion and bass, respectively.  <BR> <BR>\\"Pigs on the Wing\\" is a fine acoustic number designed to romanticize the album's contents.  \\"Dogs\\" is an incredible roller-coaster ride through various sonic landscapes.  Gilmour's diverse guitar solos provide an incredible atmosphere.  The synthesizers combine with his guitar work to create a transcendent musical experience.  \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" brilliantly depicts Waters' view of hypocritical world leaders, a subject that he would elaborate in The Final Cut. The song's ending once again shows Gilmour's guitar pyrotechnics.  \\"Sheep\\" is a searing attack at clueless followers.  It is a bone-chilling number that ranks as one of Pink Floyd's finest hard rock tunes.  A humorous revision of the 23rd psalm is included for one's enjoyment.  <BR> <BR>It is not surprising that Waters would create this conceptual album at the time.  \\"Dogs\\" can be taken as an allegorical jab at the avarice of record executives (a subject he covered on Pink Floyd's preceding album, Wish You Were Here).  \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" is an attack on the irritating politicians and censors troubling Waters at the time.  Finally, \\"Sheep\\" is a salvo fired at the witless followers of Pink Floyd (just take a look at the disastrous tour that followed this release).<br />All in all, Animals is a masterpiece.  An acerbic and nihilistic composition, Animals is a great complement to a burgeoning rock collection.
B00003003R|4.0|The first disc opens the album with a blistering rendition of \\"Nightrain,\\" followed by a pounding and even stronger \\"Mr. Brownstone.\\"  However, when the song ends, Axl gives a long speech to the crowd about how they should all move back to not get hurt. While in good intentions for the actual concert, it was a stupid addition to the live album and should have been taken out. \\"It's So Easy\\" followed suit, and was another good track, although the vocals were a little drowned out (something that plagues various other moments on this album). \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" finally kicks in with great intros, both by a vocal cord stripping Axl and the fighting opening chords of Slash and Gilby (if not Izzy). \\"Dust N' Bones\\" followed, which was one of my favorite songs in the studio, but was produced badly for the live album and included annoying and useless synthesizers. Next came \\"My Michelle\\" and \\"You're So Crazy,\\" both good hard rockers, followed by an electric version of \\"Used to Love Her\\" (even better than the acoustic).  Next came \\"Patience,\\" where the whole arena sang along with Axl providing a good ambience. (shouldn't all live albums do that?) The first disc closes with \\"It's Alright\\", a delightfully done cover of Bill Ward's Black Sabbath piano effort which leads into a grittier than usual \\"November Rain\\" where Axl sings with his smoke-abused vocals, yet manages to play the piano flawlessly and Slash kicks the classic solo very well, doing justice to the song.<br />The second disc opens with another Appetite song, \\"Out Ta Get Me,\\" played very well, followed by their anthem of decadence- \\"Pretty Tied Up,\\" played even better than the studio recording. An average rendition of Yesterdays came next, revolving around Dizzy on the keyboard. \\"Move to the City\\" is the next track, but was very disappointing, and of all tracks on the two disc set, is the only one that should have been replaced or omitted. The horn section drove me crazy, and the track is just too long for a songas mediocre as that. A thumping and well done \\"You Could Be Mine\\" followed, which included Axl's infamous rant which was fulfilling and mean-spirited. \\"Rocket Queen\\" came next, which did justice to the studio version and has been one of my favorite songs from the band. I especially like Duff's bass intro to the song. Next came \\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\\" a slight disappointment. The intro is great and on-target, Slash pulling his weight, but Axl's vocals are below par, drowned and the outro is horrible enough to want to break the disc. A long version of \\"Knockin' on Heavens Door\\" followed, which includes a verse in \\"reggae\\" and a bridge where Axl uses two female back-up singers to help the crowd participate in chanting, enough to give the listener chills. \\"Don't Cry\\" followed suit, though the back-up singers were a little too prominent in the vocal duties. A great rendition of \\"Estranged\\" followed, with plenty of keyboards and Slash again pulling his weight in gold and included one of Axl's better vocal performances. The entire set ended with \\"Paradise City,\\" a renowned arena rocker played well and to its fullest extent, closing the whole set, leaving every fan satisfied.<br />With this two-disc set, I recognize some correlation with the live home videos of the Tokyo Use Your Illusions Tour. Same recordings?  Maybe.  Although the production team probably tried making the album sound like one show, it wasn't. I think they could have picked some other anthems in place of some of the few mediocre tracks. Just as many people have wondered, I asked myself why I didn't see \\"Civil War\\" or \\"Get in the Ring,\\" both awesome arena rockers. How about \\"Live and Let Die?\\" There was no problem broadcasting that on the 1992 VMA's. Why not \\"Double Talkin' Jive,\\" \\"Don't Damn Me,\\" \\"Bad Apples,\\" \\"Dead Horse?\\" Maybe I'd just like to see all of their tracks done live!<br />Also, I currently went to see Guns N' Roses live with the new line-up (Nov. 8, 2002 Tacoma, WA) and recalled that the newset is very similar to the songs offered on this album. Axl seemed to have taught the new line-up well, or maybe each member just has a copy of this album.<br />However, all in all, the album is good. The only thing keeping it at a 4 star rating is the bad production and the one or two below par tracks.  I especially recommend this if you've been dying to hear the original band live and long to see them united.
B00005OAIE|4.0|While every fourteen year old girl in the world is in love with this guy, you can't help but try anf sift through it and realize that he is a really talented guitar player.  When I first heard \\"No Such Thing\\" I thought it was terrible and the lyrics were not mature at all.  Then he released \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" and I liked that at first, but it got so overplayed (that song is likely to be the equivalent to \\"Crash\\" by DMB if he ever gets that huge) and I started to hate it.  Then he released \\"Why, Georgia\\" and that's when I realized why everyone was telling me to check this guy out.  I'm obsessed with DMB and I never saw an similarities until I heard him live.  To listen to John live and then dave live at luther, you cna see how talented of a guitar player he really is.  While this CD is not flawless, it is starting to grow on me.  Maybe one day it'll be my favorite.  It should be interesting to hear music from him in the future, becuase he has potential to be an awesome musician, and it's ashame he got wrapped up in being a \\"pop star.\\"
B000002LFZ|5.0|If you like Fleetwood Mac, this is the album for you.  All of the greatest hits are included.  I think it's better than their release &quot;The Dance.&quot;
0684857219|5.0|This is by far the best bodybuilding book for just about anyone.  Some reviewers have pointed out that the routines lead to overtraining.  However, the book continually emphasizes tailoring the routines and ideas to your own individual needs.  It does not promote the use of drugs.  Overtraining is a highly individual problem and actually serves a useful purpose for short periods of time.  Most of the routines presented are not for the average hack bodybuilder.  His introductory routines are for people in good shape with some experience.  They are a goal in their own right.  The book also serves the interests of beginners by providing great descriptions of the vast majority of bodybuilding exercises in existence.  Remember that the exercises have to be properly performed.  If not their value is greatly reduced.  So to even utilize the routines one must master the exercises.  I suspect that many will find that after building up to the routines they will not be overtraining.  Be very careful about signing up for the hardgainer mentality too quickly.  Also, the nutrition section is not that out of date.  It just emphasizes the basics which is all most people really need anyhow.
B000006FNX|3.0|This movie was a sweet farewelll to the only man who will ever really &quot;be&quot; Bond. 1983 was a wild year for Bond fans. We had NSNA and the abomination Octopussy in the theaters. NSNA is of course, a remake with a few plot differences of Thunderball. <br />Kim Bassinger has the same blank look that she has in all her movies and her hair was so over bleached that it looked frizzy and darn near fried in every single scene. She's a long way down from Ursula Andress. The villain isn't as frightening as the original Largo. Still, NSNA is a terrific Bond fim because of Connery. Like all the Connery films the action is played seriously. There's humor of course but the movie itself isn't a joke like Octopussy.
0736041850|5.0|I found this to be an excellent book. It has great descriptions of the exercises and has great diagrams showing which muscles are worked by the exercises. There is really not much more to be said. You simply can't go too far wrong getting this book. My only complaint is that the book could have been improved by adding some information on designing routines that utilize the exercises but this is a minor quibble and was not the goal of the book. It would have been great however if the diagrams were integrated into a book of the same nature as Bill Pearl's Getting Stronger or even Arnold's bodybuilding encyclopedia.  One more thing just to be clear: the book contains detailed descriptions on how to perform the exercises.  This and Arnold's book are where I go for technique.
0385486804|3.0|Chris McCandless had a college education, a nice family and book smarts. So why did he give it all up to walk into the Alaska wilderness armed only with a bag of rice? Instead of beating eaten immediately by a polor bear or a pack of wolves he was found 4 months later, having starved to death.  So what was Chris McCandless? Was he a Darwin Award winner? Was he crazy or was he simply a romantic young fool? The book never really tells us and even the author can't make up his mind. All we really know is that in Alaska a young man's boyish notions ran smack dab into cruel reality. <BR>It's an interesting book about an endurring mystery.
B0000683DH|2.0|The Director's Edition was, overall, very disappointing.  Although the rextras were nice, it would have been great to get more than one trailer.  I do, however, take issue with the transfer to DVD of the feature itself.<br />It's blocky.  It's grainy.  Watch the VHS release (the one in the box set, where you could see the Enterprise if you lined all 6 tapes up) if you don't believe me.  The picture is much smoother and finished looking.  The additional scenes were nice though, but I've noticed they changed the timing and pace sometimes.  Overall, the VHS beats the widescreen DVD.<br />The movie itself is the best in the entire series and should be included in film courses at college so it remains part of our collective heritage.<br />So go...and see if you can track down an older copy.  Or wait for paramount to releease yet another version of the movie on DVD.  This is for die-hard Trekkers only.

B00004SCX6|5.0|I've heard people saying Britney's second CD is just a complete clone of \\"Baby One More Time\\". But it's not that bad people! This is better then \\"Baby\\"! It's not as good as her latest \\"Britney\\", but it's still dead good! Stand out tracks on this CD are:<br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door - The first song on the CD that really caught me. I love Britney in her girl power mode, she sings a rocking song with loads of attitude.<br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - I like this cover. I've never heard the original (I'm only 15), but I bet this is just as good. It drags on at the end, but it's so catchy you won't notice.<br />5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - A gorgeous ballad, with a slightly erotic video. The song by itself is much better. I didn't like when I first got the CD, but I love it now!<br />6. What U See (Is What U Get) - My favourite. Great message behind it, don't try to change it. Sounds like a classic Britney song.<br />7. Lucky - Everyone knows this sweet song. I don't really need to review it, but I'll just say it's a really good song.<br />10. Can't Make You Love Me - Another classic Brit pop song, with a cool chorus and verses.<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It - Another of my favourites. I LOVE the music in this song, and Britney's vocals.<br />12. Dear Diary - Britney helped write this, and it's a lovely little track, with cute lyrics.<br />This is a good follow up to a huge album, even if Britney can't sing the tracks live. I enjoy this CD, even though I don't really like Britney anymore (I lost respect for her after she dissed her fans).
B000021YQV|2.0|Well, I bought this album based upon the three songs I heard on the radio: Chop Suey!, Toxicity, and Aerials, and frankly I am dissapointed.  This album is a hit and miss.  On one hand it has some great songs on it, but on the other a few songs (namely Jet Pilot and X) bring it down.  The only non-radio song on here that I have learned to like is Science and maybe Bounce (mainly for its comic value.)  <br />The band does have some talent, and they do have a unique sound to them.  However, I think that if they trimmed off some of the lower quality songs on here, the album would have been better.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Out of her three albums, self titled \\"Britney\\" is the best one. It has the best tracks, and the better writers behind it. I think this album is produced the best. Now, I am going to say Britney can't sing that well, her voice is very \\"produced\\" and \\"fake\\". If she actually sung live, maybe everyone would stop dissing her. I own all three Britney albums, and can safely say this is definitely the best one. Stand out tracks are:<br />2. Overprotected - One of my favourites. Very classic Britney. I love the chorus, it's so catchy. I also like the middle 8 and the part where she says \\"Action!\\". Very cool.<br />3. Lonely - Another classic track. You'd almost think you were listening to \\"Baby One More Time\\" or \\"Oops I Did It Again\\". I first thought this was slow, but in fact it's an upbeat dancy track with a great singable chorus.<br />5. Boys - I like this version, but I prefer the version with Pharrell from N.E.R.D. But this is catchy, with cool verses and a funky middle 8.<br />8. Cinderella - More classic Britney, with great music and a groovy chorus and middle 8.<br />10. Bombastic Love - My favourite. I love this because of it's catchy chorus, and dead cool verses.<br />12. What It's Like To Be Me - Britney probably doesn't like this track anymore, because it's written by Justin and he sings on it, but I really like it! Justin adds a funky touch to this song, and Britney sounds really cool.<br />On my CD, I have two extra tracks - \\"When I Found You\\" (my FAVOURITE apart from \\"Bombastic Love\\"... it's a beautiful ballad) and \\"Before The Goodbye\\" (A dancy, funky track).<br />Britney's time as a superstar is quickly running out, but this album is really good... it's a shame this is her least best selling album. It's the best one!
B00006YXEK|5.0|This is an achingly beautiful, absolutely sensational album. As numerous other reviewers have observed, it is reminiscent of Harrison's work with the Traveling Wilburys (especially on the second Wilburys' album). Harrison's guitar work on this album also reminded me of the terrific solo he crafted for The Beatles' \\"Real Love\\" single.<br />There's not a great deal to add to the other positive reviews that appear here. I would, however, like to take a bit of issue with those who complained about Jeff Lynne's contribution to the sound of this album. Listen, Lynne's not a guy who was plucked out of the phone book. He was Harrison's band mate with the Wilburys and had produced other Harrison albums. Lynne produced this album because everyone wanted that including, no doubt, George before his death.<br />But back to advice for those who are contemplating the purchase of this album: Do it. If money is a big deal, then go ahead and get the CD-only package. (The video that's on the Bonus DVD can be viewed on georgeharrison.com.) But, for my money, the packaging of this enhanced edition is well worth a few extra bucks. (Is the guitar pick cool? Absolutely!) But whichever version you choose, definitely make sure this music finds its way into your collection.
B000000WFF|5.0|I LOVE this CD. I am still a Spice Girls fan at heart! I love this CD, but \\"Spice\\" is better. \\"Spiceworld\\" is a more mature brand of Spice, but still dead brilliant! Mel B, Victoria, Mel C, Emma and Geri still remain the members of the biggest girl band to ever walk the earth! Stand out tracks are:<br />1. Spice Up Your Life - A classic Spice Girls song. I love this video to this song... this song is fair, with all the girls singing together. I love the dancy beat on this track.<br />3. Too Much - This slow song shows the girls can really sing, Mel C sounding the best. I love the chorus and the middle 8.<br />4. Saturday Night Divas - A cool party song with a chorus you can't get out of your head. I love the bridges from Emma, too.<br />6. Move Over - This was my favourite song on the album for ages, then it got boring. But it's still dead cool! It's the Pepsi song (along with \\"Step To Me\\") and I love the crazy chorus!<br />8. Denying - My favourite, now. I love the chorus and Emma's bridges, again. I love Mel C's backings at the end and the rest of the group's vocals.<br />9. Viva Forever - A beautiful ballad, with gorgeous lyrics and vocals. Emma sounds good on the first verse, and Mel B sounds haunting right at the very end.<br />This has loads of cool tracks, but \\"Spice\\" has better tracks. But this is still a brilliant CD, a good follow-up. The Spice Girls may be mostly no more, but they will always be the best girl band!
B0000542D2|3.0|The movie's still fun, but two things surprised and disappointed me about it.<BR>First of all, all of the songs have been artificially \\"stereo-ized.\\" This effect is about as convincing as the \\"Wide\\" button on a boombox and is pretty cheesy, especially if you listen on headphones. I would have preferred the original mono mixes re-mastered with super-clear DVD audio quality.<BR>Next, as a Mac user, I'm totally shut out of a number of DVD extras I was interested in, such as viewing the movie script. Miramax loses big points for not even considering us Mac users, many of whom are musicians and likely buyers of this DVD. There's no note on the box warning us, and not even a respectful, \\"sorry, losers.\\" Boo to them.
B00006J3WH|5.0|When i recieved this cd i was wondering if it would be a good cd, i found it to be very creative. I thought that the actors and actresses have some talent as well. I just thought of it as a must for any one who likes the show.
B00004YZFR|5.0|These days, since the Rolling Stones have become the  rock equivalent of an old-timers baseball team, their live act resembling a tribute band attempting to imitate the Stones and<BR>doing a bad job of it, and with the release of their unspeakable<BR>\\"Don't Stop\\" single (more on that in a second), it's hard to remember what a rock-and-roll colossus the Stones were in 1969.<BR>(It's most difficult for me to remember, since I was only 3 at the time). Nonetheless, if you're wondering where the Stones<BR>got their \\"Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\\" moniker, watch this DVD.<BR>           Watch the Stones perform \\"Satisfaction\\". If I never hear the radio version of that song again, I won't care. Yet, I<BR>can listen to this Madison Square version over and over again.<BR>Just a raw, tough number: Mick's theatrics, Charlie Watts's superb leadership on the drums (if you don't have Charlie, you don't have the Stones,I will not argue about this). Watch them<BR>tear through \\"Street Fighting Man\\", the climax to the 60's pre-Altamont. What a ride!<BR>(Back to \\"Don't Stop\\": when I first heard it, I thought it was one of Mick's solo songs, so I thought \\"Oh well, another lame Jagger tune.\\" Then afterward, the DJ indentified it as a Stones<BR>song! A STONES song? You mean Keith Richards and Charlie Watts are also responsible for this? Memo to Mick and Co: either do it<BR>right, or don't do it. Your fans aren't that stupid.)<BR>Back to Gimme Shelter.<BR>(OK, here's the part about Altamont)<br />All the postmortems about Altamont have been written and discussed over and over, so I won't go into them here. All I can say is that if you ever decide to plan a rock festival, and it's only 24 hours before you are scheduled to go onstage and you don't have a concert site lined up, cancel. That's all I can say.<BR>Gimme Shelter includes the pre-concert negotiations between Mel Belli an others. One scene says it all for me. As Altamont speedway owner Dick Carter explains how he will provide adequate parking facilities for 300,000 people, the camera shows attorney Belli with a what-the-heck-are-we-getting-ourselves-into look on<BR>his face. The concert was an disaster waiting to happen, and everyone involved knew it, but nobody could stop a runaway train.<BR>Gimme Shelter is part concert film, and part slice of history. Eveything is laid bare, without the benefit of journalistic spin<BR>evident in current films about the 60's. The viewer also gets to<BR>see and hear the Rolling Stones at the absolute top of their game, building a reputation that they still are living on today.
B0000024R8|5.0|In many ways, this is my favorite Bob Dylan album. He didn't write most of the songs but his incredible interpretations made them his own anyway. Compare his \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" to the original folk version on the hit single from the 'O Brother Where Art Thou' soundtrack. He virtually rewrote the melody (much for the better in my opinion) and changed some of the lyrics - most notably substituting \\"Colorado\\" for \\"Kentucky,\\"  resulting in a brilliant approximate rhyme with \\"constant sorrow.'   Listen to the soulful and inventive slide guitar on \\"In My Time of Dying'\\" -- it doesn't get much better than that! (Too bad he couldn't remember the song's composer -- Blind Willie Johnson who titled it \\"Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed\\" -- but Dylan did have the integrity not to put his own name on it, as others have done in similar circumstances. I just can't keep from crying about that). Dylan's vocals, guitar and harp playing on this entire record are unsurpassed - by him or any other folk/blues artist I've ever heard.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Brahms's four symphonies represent a good example of <BR>&quot;quality over quantity&quot;. Like most perfectionists, Brahms was his own worst critic, and the very fact that he considered these symphonies worthy of publishing says volumes about their musical value. Moreover, they are more than deserving of the time and effort invested in them by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, conductor Georg Solti, and London records (my deepest gratitude goes out to all who played a part in bringing about these superb recordings). And given that this four-cd collection is priced less than two cds makes it head-and-shoulders above most other current bargains. If I had a nickel for every time I've listened to one of these symphonies, I might have enough to buy a back-up copy!
B00006GFAB|3.0|First off, the cover of this album is awesome!  It would make a great poster! Now for the music...<br />For those who have KISS's studio albums, this compilation is obviously not worth the money.  It has only the standard tracks with nothing new or rare (how many live versions of &quot;Rock N Roll All Night&quot; does one need?).<br />For those who do not own a KISS album and want an introduction, this is a good CD; however, keep in mind that (1) it does not cover KISS's entire career and (2) it does not contain several KISS classics that are on almost every other compilation album.<br />Like most &quot;Best of KISS&quot; compilations, this record's track listing is taken mostly from KISS's pre-solo album years (it does have Ace Frehley's &quot;New York Groove&quot;).  This CD, however, does seem to spread itself out more by taking tracks from all those albums instead of concentrating of KISS's debut album which sports a huge portion of KISS's live shows even through the final tour.  This may be the reason that this CD includes tracks like &quot;Got To Choose,&quot; &quot;Hotter Than Hell,&quot; &quot;I Want You,&quot; etc. yet does not include longtime KISS standards like &quot;Firehouse,&quot; &quot;Cold Gin,&quot; &quot;Black Diamond&quot; (all of which are from the first KISS album), and &quot;God of Thunder&quot; (off Destroyer from which three other songs are on this CD).<br />Understandably, this compilation completely skips over less familiar KISS works like Unmasked, Music From The Elder, and most of the non-makeup releases.  I agree with another reviewer on this site that &quot;Heaven's On Fire&quot; (the most famous post-makeup--or, actually, inter-makeup track) is a glaring omission.  Based on the cover artwork with the original members, these non-makeup omissions may have been intentional, but then including the last three tracks does not seem to make sense.  Having said that, &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; is sorely missing from this CD.
0151008116|4.0|I spent the whole Saturday chasing the audacious journey of Pi on Pacific Ocean... deeply touched and captivated... it's not about God and I am not a believer, but you would wonder his power behind our existence, or more exactly our own strength through faith... you would wonder the non-randomness of absolute universe... I am very much amazed by author's imagination, by his superb skill of story-telling; beneath this adventurous story lies subtly the more philosophical and spiritual rhythm... it's not a must-read book, but once you go through the journey with Pi, the cinematic view and mesmerized notion would forever stay in your mind...
B00006LLLN|5.0|Can you see the huge smile on my face?  After listening to the 25(mostly recent material) selections, I believe that this is Alison, Union Station &amp; Jerry Douglas at their (up to this point) best.  For a price tag of less than what you would expect to pay for a single CD, I say:  &quot;Thanks for the gift, Alison Krauss, Union Station and Jerry Douglas!  Bluegrass and Trad Country Rule!
B00000099Y|5.0|No point trying to review it, you just have to listen to it.
B00006JIA4|5.0|The first disk shows Queen's best from the mid to late '70s; the second disk shows Queen's best from the '80s which really put them mainstream into pop culture.  The third disk, while short of original Queen material shows the influence they had on the rest of the music scene.  I believe that George Michael's version of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; has to go down as one of the best remakes of any Queen tune.
B00006V9A0|5.0|It's easy to complain about the good songs that are NOT on this disc, but come on; anybody can make their own Nirvana compilation, on tape or otherwise.  If you want all of Nirvana's good songs, then buy all their CDs - it's that simple.  The goal behind this album was to make a good summary of thier short career, and I think that is accomplished.<br />The album begins with \\"You Know You're Right\\", Nirvana's much-hyped final recording.  It's a great song, and it's amazing how something that's nearly 10 years old puts all the new [stuff] on the radio to shame.  Next is \\"About A Girl\\", the only song from \\"Bleach\\" that I really liked (that's not to say I didn't like the rest - I just didn't like it as much as the later material).  Then we have \\"Been A Son\\" and \\"Sliver\\", two songs that I didn't really like before I got this CD but fell in love with upon repeated listenings (this version of \\"Been A Son\\" is much better than the version featured on \\"Incesticide\\", by the way - not as rushed).  Next, there's four songs from \\"Nevermind\\" (\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", and \\"Lithium\\"), and then four from \\"In Utero\\" (\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", \\"Rape Me\\", and \\"Dumb\\").  This version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is much more polished I think, and it actually rivals the \\"Unplugged\\" version.  Finally, the last two songs are lifted from the \\"Unplugged\\" performance (\\"All Apologies\\", \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\").  <br />All in all, it's a great summary of their career.  Yeah, I wish there were a few more songs, like \\"Aneurysm\\" and \\"Verse Chorus Verse\\", but I can't complain too much.  It's Nirvana; how can it NOT be good??? :)     I can't wait till they release the box set........
B00005B4GU|5.0|I think the Pink Floyd comparisons stopped here. This is a great combination of the guitar sound in Ok Computer and the electronic weirdness of Kid A. Combined is something truly original. Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box is an excellent opener, with some good drone singing by Thom Yorke. Pyramid Song, the 1st single (I think), is very moving and very emotional. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors is a trip back to Kid A before moving on to, what's this? Guitars? You And Whose Army and I Might Be Wrong are perfect together and should delight old fans. Knives Out is the surf song, as i say, because of the guitar tone. It's a brilliant single. Morning Bell sounds tame compared to the one on Kid A. Too soft. Dollars and Cents has some of the best singing i've heard from Thom. Hunting Bears is a little strange. The guitars start, stop, start, stop. Weird. Like Spinning Plates is experimental, but not that great. Decent. Life In A Glasshouse is very jazzy and very nice. It can get loud, however, espiecally with that C note in the chorus. Good album, I hope to hear more from them.
B00005OAIE|1.0|This album has sold millions of copies, and John Mayer has made it big with this album.  That in no way makes it a good album however.  If you will recall, the New Kids On The Block were once filling the charts, but do we consider that to be great music?  He sites his influences as Stevie Ray Vaughan and Dave Matthews, but does little but immitate, and produce senseless garb to be eaten up by tiny boppers.  His talent can easily mislead you into purchasing the album, but talent with no soul simply makes for mediocrity.  The only thing outstanding about John Mayer is his ability to love himself.  He may be good at what he does, but what he does makes me want to puke on my shoes.  If you are serious about music, I suggest avoiding this album, and all his cheesy, videos.  If you find this music to be new, exciting and heartfelt, then by all means, buy a copy today.  Just don't forget your Backstreet Boys, Justin Timberlake and Avril albums.  They will be of the same quality.  Here today gone tomorrow.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the 1st Radiohead album that I've listened to, and it's by far their best. I love the feel on this album about wanting to slow down because technology is corrupting our minds. Personally, I think that's a great message. The songs are absolutely terrific. Airbag is a brilliant opener and has a great guitar sound. I love it in the middle when there's this noise coming from left and right. It sounds like a car crash. Paranoid Android, the single off the album (very complex for a single), is by far, a man's entire emotions in 1 song. Sad, beatiful, angry, happy, and confused. Very good. Subterreanean Homesick Alien is one of their best. Great hook, great chorus, just great. Exit Music is my favorite. Romeo and Juliet put into a rock ballad. It's very very good. Let Down picks up after Exit Music with a happy, yet at the same time sad song about being alone. Karma Police is a weird song. Don't know the meaning just yet. Fitter Happier is the closest thing to humor on this album. Very sarcastic. Electioneering just plain kicks... . Radiohead can still rock out. Climbing Up The Walls is very disturbing and scary, espeically with the opening noises. No Suprises is a great 3rd single with some nice singing. Another happy, yet sad song. Lucky has a big sound to it that reminds me of plane crashes. Maybe it's the line \\"Pull me out of the aircrash.\\" And The Tourist is a brilliant ender. A great album.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I heard the first song released from stripped, \\"DiRRty\\", I thought Christina had just gone all R&B-ish and that the entire album will be about her singing on sweating 'til her clothes come off or somethin'. Well Ms. Xtina has managed to AMAZE me once again, only this time even more since she wrote most of the songs, and wow, that girl can write as well as she can sing. In \\"Stripped\\" Christina mixes pop, R&B, Jazz & even rock, but you know what...it sounds so good it's addictive. If you were impressed by Christina's earlier work...FORGET THAT! Cuz Stripped will blow your mind. My personal favorite has to be \\"I'm Ok\\" I admire the Christina opens up to her audience in something so personal, it's truly admirable, the song will totally touch your heart and bring you to tears. However, not all the songs are sad and blue, \\"Make Over\\" is the type of song you play on your way to work when you just don't feel like putting up with people's BS! \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" I'm so glad she decided to put that song in the album, even though it was last minute, it works, the whole casual sex theme coming from a girl is totally enpowering to women, just like \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\". If you want to treat yoursel or someone you know with a great musical gift, give 'em \\"Stripped\\" it charm ya, I promise!<BR>  1. Stripped p.1 - good intro.<BR>  2. Can't Hold Us Down - \\"B-\\"<BR>  3. Walk Away - \\"A\\"<BR>  4. Fighter - \\"A\\"<BR>  5.Primer Amor - interlude<BR>  6.Infatuation - \\"B\\"<BR>  7. Love's Embrace - interlude<BR>  8.Loving me 4 me - \\"A\\"<BR>  9. Impossible - \\"A-\\"<BR>  10.Underappreciated - \\"C+\\"<BR>  11.Beautiful - \\"A\\"<BR>  12.Make Over - \\"A\\"<BR>  13. Cruz - \\"B-\\"<BR>  14.Soar - B+\\"<BR>  15.Get Mine, Get Yours - \\"A\\"<BR>  16. DiRRty - \\"A-\\"<BR>  17 Stripped P.2 - interlude<BR>  18. The Voice Within - \\"B\\"<BR>  19. I'm Ok - \\"A+\\"<BR>  20. Singing My Song - \\"B+\\"
B00004XONN|5.0|I'm sure that was the response from the fans, who love The Bends so much, said when they heard Kid A. It's very shocking to see a alternative-pop-rock band from the 90's go into this experimental-electronic sound. It's very hard for a band to do it, but Radiohead did it flawlessly. I like that. The songs are a lot darker, even compared to Ok Computer. The National Anthem is by far the noisest Radiohead song ever. Treefingers is so strange and sounds like nothing's happening, but there is a great melody (download the extended version. It's really cool!). Morning Bell and In Limbo have very scary endings. I personally like the arpeggios in In Limbo. Optimistic has a sort of PJ Harvey sound to it, which I like. And Motion Picture Soundtrack is very good, but very short. So, you have about 50 minutes of bliss. Great album.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This review is not about the film, so much as this joyous new DVD release.  I first experienced AKIRA around 1991, when the first VHS release came to the U.S.  The film had quite an impact, but I have to admit that it suffered from the plague which do most anime imports: poor transfer, inadequate dubbing, and VERY lackluster translation.  I guarantee, if you had just a little trouble understanding this film on VHS, you weren't alone.  I must have watched my tape about a hundred times and still had questions left unanswered.  Several years after the last time I watched AKIRA, this wonderful DVD release came the U.S.  I bought it for the greatly improved transfer (the colors are vibrant and the aspect ratio restored), but was rewarded with a new stellar translation and voice-over dubbing.  It was like I was seeing AKIRA for the first time.  Suddenly, everything I never understood came clear, and I was really convinced that the characters were children (this time they sounded like children).  I agree that dubbing is unacceptable for live-action films, but I think it works for animation--only if the voice actors are appropriate and the translation accurate.  Japanese is a very different language from English, and I have a feeling that more popular fare like Pokemon and Dragonball Z mean something much different over there.  Such is the same with AKIRA.  If you've only seen the previous VHS version, you've really not seen the film.  As a fan of anime, and AKIRA, I rejoice in this DVD, as I know I have come quite a bit closer to seeing what the animators originally intended.<br />Now go watch THE END OF EVANGELION!
B00004BZ16|5.0|The Clash are one of the best bands of all time. great album
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I freaking &lt;3 this CD. My friend David told me about some of the songs on it and I was hearing &quot;All the things she said&quot; on the radio alot, so I decided to buy the whole CD. It's so good! My favorite songs on the CD are &quot;Ya Shosla S Uma&quot; and &quot;Stars&quot;. I highly recommend this CD! It's awesome!
B00004Z459|1.0|This CD is horrible.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  It seems alright at frist because it opens with the only 2 decent songs of this horrid CD.  Then, it goes down hill.  How this was the highest selling CD last year I am not sure because it [stinks].  Rap & rock where not maid to mix.  If you want sum good music go get a Mink CD!
0800141660|5.0|I've seen a lot of movies--read even more books. There's something about this film that makes me want to see it again and again and each time, it's as brilliant as the first and I end it with tears streaming down my face. It's a completely successful adaptation of Jane Austin's story. Emma Thompson's wit and &quot;sensibility&quot; shines. The acting is supurb and I have already turned my young daughters into fans. Don't miss this wonderful film.
0316776963|5.0|Bottom line: This book will make it difficult to catch your breath regardless of your current lung capacity. <br />I first heard Sedaris on NPR one morning and found myself choking on my toothpaste from laughter. Months later I saw this title while perusing a local bookstore. I picked it up to have some fluffy reading on the beach not realizing I'd tear through it before I ever reached my vacation spot. My husband thought I was mildly deranged from all the hooting and giggling on that road trip.<br />Since then, I've consumed the rest of Sedaris' work with breathless enthusiasm while impatiently waiting to attend his local appearance this coming April. I purchased several of his books for folks on my holiday shopping list to share his gift for distilling the utterly hilarious from the painful and/or embarrassing moments of life. Four days after Christmas and I'm already receiving thank-you notes about it.<br />David Sedaris is a comic treasure. And who couldn't use a little levity after spending the holidays with dysfunctional relatives? Order this book now and request express shipping! Just remember to breathe every page or so.
0316776963|5.0|This collection of essays is hysterical-truly laugh-out-loud material. I sat in an airport waiting area reading the piece titled, \\"Big Boy\\" and didn't realize people were staring at me until the man next to me finally said, \\"what on earth are you reading that's so damn funny?\\" The stories are simple, well crafted and worth every minute.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
B00005IC2H|5.0|until you listen to it with someone you can cry with and hold... maybe it only affects highly sensitive people this way; i hope not.  Everyone deserves the transcendent, emotional human experience this album offers.
0380789035|2.0|Neil Gaiman has an original and interesting writing style, but this book meanders around. The pay off is not there. It's not worth the ride. Anti-climatic. Do not waste your time.
0553573403|5.0|I almost don't want to admit to myself how darn good this book was.  So many times an epic fantasy comes down the pipeline and the first book drops heavily into your lap, laden with promise and you devour it and move eagerly to the next book . . . and the writer can't sustain it.  I don't want that to happen here.  Martin's book is the best thing to hit epic fantasy since that little guy tried to ditch that ring someone gave him.  Martin strips away all the things that have bloated the fantasy genre over the years, useless window dressing races, simplistic good vs evil conflicts blown up to ridiculous proportions, and even (yes!) magic and brings it back to the two most important elements: epic and characters.  Martin's land is more akin to a medieval society and is as complex as anything we've got on this here planet, even if there are only humans on it.  But what humans.  The cast of characters is sprawling, not unlike such books as War and Peace, and Martin makes every single one an actual three dimensional person, kings and commoners, men and women, children and elderly, all complete with shades of good and bad.  Nobody is utterly flawed but neither are they pure and good.  In fact they're just like real people, and their words and actions resonate.  Martin keeps the complicated plot moving by dividing the book into relatively short chapters, all from the POV of a different character.  Not only does the jumping back and forth create a sort of suspense, but it gives the reader a variety of views on the same event sometimes, lending the book an extra layer of complexity.  Without giving too much away the plot involves basically everyone trying to kill everyone else without making it look like they're trying to kill everyone.  But this intrigue is enormously exciting and Martin keeps the twists coming nonstop.  He's not afraid to mess with any of these characters and he does.  This isn't a book for the faint of hard, events start out bad and go steadily downhill from there.  Every good turn is balanced but an equally bad turn and by the end the score doesn't seem so balanced anymore.  Characters you think will last to the end of the series are killed, brutally and with the sort of finality that you know he's not playing games.  You get the sense that nobody is safe and that's a good thing.  It's a gritty world, where all actions have consequences, and while it's not all darkness and gloom (there's a lot of black humor but a lot of honestly funny stuff too) there aren't many chapters where people are picking flowers either.  The best praise I can give is that Martin's world feels real, with its own dense history sprinkled throughout, and this weight gives the book its main strength.  I may not want to live here, but I sure as heck can accept its existence.  I don't want to say that this book is flawless, but it just about is, every risk works, every twist makes sense, Martin's lean yet muscular prose, unexpectedly leaping into pure poetry at some moments, is the perfect drive for this constantly moving story.  It's hard to make people believe that a gigantic tale built around manipulations could be a page turner but it is, most definitely.  After suffering through so many longwinded pretenders, finally a book that feels like epic fantasy, the way it's supposed to be.  It shouldn't be this good.  Except it is.  It can't stay this good.  I have a feeling it will.  On to the next book!om there.  Every good turn is balanced but an equally bad turn and by the end the score doesn't seem so balanced anymore.

B000068PQ0|5.0|Yoshimi is absolutely absurd... yet incredibly delightful.  Its nonsense makes one realize that music should be fun.  Yoshimi herself is fighting against boredom to help us find happiness through her journey.  <BR>A true masterpiece... avoiding the complex world of lyrics where one has to deeply think through the process.  Yoshimi is simplicity.  Simple is always better.
B00005JL78|5.0|Tom Cruise stars in Minority Report, directed by none other then Steven Speilberg. A futuristic science-fiction movie about the government testing a new tactic in crime fighting called precrime. Precrime is the ability to capture vision of the future from three twins that can envision the future of murders. The system was perfect until it envisioned Tom Cruise murdering some unknown person. But instead of turning himself in he runs and tries to prove his innocence.<br />The plot was solid except for a lingering question that I still can not answer. The technology in the movie was by far the coolest part. to the way the computers were to the 3D projections. The cars that could scale up and down vertical buildings to the rotar-less helicopters.
0679745203|5.0|There are two couples in the movie.  In one, the woman is a dead witch, and the man is in a bed lying very still.  In the other, the woman is a nurse whose boyfriends tend to die, and the other DEFUSES BOMBS!!!<br />Which couple do you find more interesting?  The movie focuses on the dead witch and the man lying in bed.  The book gives them space, but focuses more on the other two lovers.  You know, the ones who we care about a whole lot more and whose jobs are real interesting.<br />Oh, and in case you haven't heard, Ondaatje is a weaver of words unchallenged in North America.  Maybe South American authors (mostly dead) can give him a run for his Booker, but they aren't in the commonwealth, are they?  This text is a gorgeous jewel.  Check this one out and avoid that awful, boring, tedious, cowardly film.  My theory on that unfortunate Oscar, everyone wanted to give this book the Oscar so they had to give it to the director of the movie.<br />Peace out, and word to your mother.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Lord of the Rings starts out right where it left off. If you didnt see the first movie dont go thinking that you will be able to pick up on what happened. The movie doesnt start with some flashbacks to get you up to speed, or scrolling text like the Star Wars movies are known for. <br />Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is the continuation of the Fellowship of the Rings that came out this same time last year. Two Towers is the second of three movies in the series that is based off of J.R.R. Tolkien's books. <br />The movie has a great story that has developed over the two movies. This is what is driving people to the movie theaters. Since we last saw the fellowship the group had split up into three groups. We watch all three as they battle Sauron and try to destroy the ring before it fell into the wrong hands.<br />The movie relies heavily on visual effects. For a majority of the movie the visual effects were outstanding. The huge battle at Rohan could not of been possible without the superb work of the special effects team. 10,000 troops storming the castle was really well done. Gollum was also a really well done CGI character that provide some humor at watching this character interact with his duel personalities. <br />But the visual effects were also very poor in parts of the movie that made those parts look unreal. The scene in which the people of Rohan are migrating to the castle in which they can defend themselves they are met by a riding army of Org. The battling armies do not look to even be in the scene but rather floating on top of the picture. This scene was obviously an after thought of the visual effects team. I am sure they were totally consumed in the battle at Rohan.<br />The movie ran around three hours so make sure you want to sit for that long. I found this movie to be very entertaining and I love the story line. I definably cant wait till next year to watch the third and final installment in this series.
0446310786|5.0|You know you have.  This book is required reading in so many high schools that reviewing seems redundant.<br />Yeah, it's as good as good gets.  An influence to artists of many generations.
0316666343|2.0|I've never written a review on-line before, but there has been so much hype about this book I finally gave in and bought it.  It's a gutsy premise for a book, and , as many others have said, starts off strongly, but when Sebold tries to do the really difficult stuff - tangle and untangle the pain, anger and emotions in response to such a tragedy - she fails.  Each character seems to have only one response - Dad is pitiful, Mom is detatched, little sis goes on to leave such a charmed and uneventful life it simply is not believable.  I don't want to give anything away in the book, but when events happen that would make Mahatma Gandhi angry and all Dad does is weep you just lose interest.  It is the writer's job to make a character complex, but whenever Sebold comes close to something,she pulls back and throws in another character, from the town or a roadside diner or school.  It ends up being a very superficial treatment of a very powerful subject.
B000066NW0|4.0|Ok guys I'm sick of seeing one star ratings because she isn't &quot;punk&quot; This is a great CD with great tracks such as &quot;I'm with you&quot; &quot;anything but ordinary&quot; &quot;nobodys fool&quot; and countless others YES IT IS POP MUSIC BUT ITS GOOD POP MUSIC
0684833395|4.0|At first this book puts off because it is so clever and cynical. The whole 'madness of war' concept has been covered so often that the book seems stale (though this was one of the first modern American books with this theme). This cynical and clever criticism appeals maybe to self-centered young men but it was tiresome. However the humour is genuinely suprising and the book starts to have some heart about half way through. Not everyone is an idiot and there are some nuanced portrayals of more complex characters.<br />So read it for the wit, but unless you've never read anything of the genre (i.e. anti-war novels), don't expect any fresh insights.
B000021YQV|1.0|Aerials Forest and posibly Toxicity and Chop Suey Those are the good songs on the album. Prison Song is ok the first time you hear it but eventually it gets annoying and lets not even get into the atrotcity that are &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; &quot;Phsyco&quot; &quot;X&quot; and &quot;bounce&quot; To sum it up in one word Over hyped
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are the band that saved real rock music in 2001. In a slew of nu-metal acts, teens kings and queens, and rap giants; a true band came up to take claim as the saviours of rock. And what a way to do it. <br />First of all Julian Casablancas writes great lyrics(even though his vocals sound omputer generated though; but we can forgive him for that). Garage rock has made a comeback in a big way; and The Strokes 'Is This It' is this generations answer to 'Velvet Underground And Nico'. <br />The record is one of those flawless gems that only come around the music world every 10 years or so. Back to basics rock'n'roll is what this starving music industry needs; and 'Is This It' is its four course meal.
B000002UAX|5.0|One of the Beatle's best (aren't they all great, though?), the White Album contains a full 30 songs--by far the largest collection of Beatle songs in one recording. Anyone who likes the band probably won't be disappointed by this, one of their later efforts (1968)(some eschew the early stuff--I don't know why).<br />As great as it is, the White Album could have been better.  It's a bit disjointed, lacking the coherence, for example, of Sgt Pepper and Abbey Road.  It's often described as an album more of four individuals than of a band--and it shows. Moreover, after many years and many hundreds of listenings there are songs that I wish would never have never seen the light of day--specifically: Revolution 9 (for obvious reasons), Ob La Di, Ob La Da Da, and Don't Pass Me By (might be okay if they'd put a modicum of swing in the song; instead, it just plods).  I also find little to recommend in Rocky Racoon, Bungalow Bill or Helter Skelter (whose title describes the character of the song quite well). <br />Nevertheless, the gems far outweigh the stinkers, notably: Dear Prudence, Martha My Dear, Happiness is a Warm Gun (especially the first of its three songs in one), I'm So Tired, Glass Onion, Blackbird, Julia, Back in the USSR (what a great bass), Monkey (a rocker), Long, Long, Long, Revolution #1, I Will, and Cry Baby Cry.<br />Many will disagree but I think &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; would have been better without Clapton.  While there's nothing wrong with his technical playing, his bits seem harsh in this otherwise gentle song.  George Harrison was such a great guitar player because he tried to fit inside of every song and make it better without asserting his &quot;style&quot; over everything. I think he would have made this song better had he played lead instead.  <br />The Beatles were an incredibly creative band and every new recording brought new innovations to popular music. With such creativity some mistakes may occur and in hindsight it's mucheasier to see them.  Just the same, the White Album is one of the classics; most listeners will find songs here--alot most likely--that will grab them and make them want to make this record one in their special collection of music.
B00005B4GU|5.0|this is radiohead's best album.  Every song on this album is simply amazing.  I loved most of radiohead's albums, but this is the best.  This album is so great because it contains simply beautiful pop songs.  Some highlights are &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; and &quot;In A Glass House&quot; this is jazzy, lovley, rockin', soulful and one of the most brilliant pop albums ever released.  The booklet is awesome too
B00000099Y|5.0|When people think of progressive band the first thought would be Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Symphony X or bands like those. But rarely do people considered Tool a progressive metal band. They don't sound nu-metal (way better than them), not death metal, not black metal, and not doom metal. But I considered them a progressive metal band. And unlike a lot of fellows, I don't agree that Tool is the best band on earth and certainly don't agree that Aenima is the best album ever released, but I can say that Tool is a damn fine band and this album is outstanding. <BR>     The drums and instrumentation are very tasteful and catchy, and the vocal will stick into your head. I highly recommend people to buy this album
B00006CXXU|5.0|this album is great!it is one of the best i have heard in a long time. this is christina's fouth album and as she says, she feels that this album is truly her. her songs represent her at her best, from being down right &quot;dirrty&quot; to being &quot;beautiful (in every way).&quot; christina also share's with us the pain of her past and the abuse she felt at her father hand. she has worked with some great people on this album and she should be really proud of it. everyone who feels low some time and underapreciated should listen to this album.  there is also a hidden message within the lyrics of the songs. it tells us that we can get through anything and that we will be ok in the end. i rated this ablum: 5 stars, but really it deserves much more ...
B000058T5E|5.0|I kept hearing about this new musician, Beck.  When I was looking for his work though I ran into Jeff Beck's work instead. Thinking that was the guy, I got his CD, this one, instead of Beck's \\"Sea Change.\\"  It's really pretty funny because now I've heard both musical artists, who are nothing alike, and I've become a HUGE Jeff Beck fan and not a Beck fan at all. Some accidents are made to happen, I guess.  Simply put, Jeff Beck is to rock and the guitar what Robert Ruaschenberg is to paint and modern art.  Jeff Beck IS modern art playing a guitar. His \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" alone may be the best number I've heard in a decade.<br /><br />I went back and listened to the older American blues versions of that number, for comparison purposes, and, for the first time, they sounded old fashioned and dated. Jeff Beck's version won out.  Personally, I never thought I'd say such a thing. Imogen Heap does a marvelous job singing on that number as she does on \\"Dirty Mind\\" but really the whole album is a knockout.  Other favorites are \\"Nadia\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" but the whole album scores a perfect 10.  I'm so glad I picked out the \\"wrong\\" musician and the \\"wrong\\" CD!<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00003CY6M|3.0|I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, and not surprising when you consider who's in it. John Cussack, Kate Beckinsale and their crazy journey through destiny is just the sort of thing you hope for in a film like this.  They play Brit and Sarah, who share a few perfect hours together in their first meeting, then let fate decide if they should ever meet again.  Years later, when both are about to get married (to other people), the only one either really can think of is each other, and thus a crazy quest begins to reconnect.<br />But in the end, the dialog, so important to a romantic comedy, came across like a long, boring sermon, and not the natural chit-chat between two people who have really hit it off with each other.  The actors argue on and on about fate and destiny but without any of the wit and charm of the greater classics of this genre.  For a romantic comedy, there is very little comedy in here, and most of it is accidental anyway, little bits of improvisation that the actors added to make up for the utterly humorlessness of writer/director Peter Chelsom.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I first heard of t.A.T.u through my younger sister. I loved the single &quot;All the things she said&quot; and when I bought the album I loved all their songs. It is a fantastic album and the mixture of dance and pop work really well.<BR>My only problem is that one of the tracks &quot;stars&quot; has large sections in russian and as I dont speak russian I dont know what they are singing about.<BR>but that is my only problem. The album is superb and I will be looking out for future releases from the duo.
0441172717|5.0|Imagine a barren planet, entirely covered with desert, where it never rains, and the Fremen, natives of the planet, have no words for \\"sea\\" or \\"river\\". But this planet, called Dune by the Fremen, but Arrakis on the maps, is of utmost importance: it is the only place in the Imperium where the spice, a drug almost everyone is addicted to, can be found. Young Paul Atreides must move to this thirsty planet when it is given his father, Duke Leto Atreides, after the Harkonnens, rivals of the Atreides, are kicked off. Through treachery and deceit, the Harkonnen manage to oust the Atreides once again, by killing Duke Leto. Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica of the mysterious Bene Gesserit, barely manage to escape into the desert, where they are taken in by the Fremen. <BR>   Along the way, Paul discovers his destiny as the Kwisatz Haderach, a legendary being who has the power to see through time and space. In order to survive, Paul must also demonstrate his worth to the distrustful Fremen. Among the Fremen, he finds a love in Chani.<BR>   Lady Jessica, his mother, is pregnant when she consumes the potent and poisonous Water of Life to convince the Fremen of her good intentions. The baby, Paul's sister Alia, is born with extraordinary psychic and mental powers, and is shunned.<BR>   At the climax of the story, Paul leads the Fremen against Harkonnen forces, and he himself is pitted against the cruel and ruthless Harkonnen heir apparent, as they carry out a centuries-old family feud. <BR>   He then realizes that, as Duke Atreides, he can never marry his love, Chani, for among nobles, marriages are alliances.<BR>  A very, very, very complicated story, too complicated to summarize very well, but it will all make sense if you read it. It's an adventure/science fiction/coming-of-age/tale of political intrigue all twisted into one.
B000021YQV|3.0|Like the song &quot;Aerials&quot;  that you may have heard on the radio? Well, listen to a little more of this CD online before you buy it. I was in love with the song &quot;Aerials&quot;, and do enjoy the CD, but it was not what I expected it to be. More modern and quick-tempered with a stinging flare that will leave you breathless at the end, this CD is for those that like a fire. It is the chili pepper of music and the song &quot;Aerials&quot; is the white lamb. So do not be decieved by the song &quot;Aerials&quot;, buy this CD for the other 13 tracks on it.
0066214122|5.0|Michael Crichton has always been one of my favorite authors...hes also one of the most skilled writers i know...he has a medical doctorate from Harvard med., hes obviously a very accomplished writer and playwright, and he is a 6'5, 60 year old man! how amazing! but this book will not fail to keep you reading day in and day out...i finished it in a day and im only 15! He does make all the technical jargon very easy to understand with the surrounding text...its a great investment to buy this book...do it ! you wont regret it! (If you want to know more about the book just read the other reviews around here...or read a couple of the pages above!) Buy this book and enjoy!
B00005B36H|5.0|I can't believe anyone would call Tool boring as \\"donkey poop\\".... Tool is an experiacne it's not music in my mind it's a being..... Being a fan of Tool for about 5 years I have gone long distances to experiance there unigue sound and vibe. To anyone who would have a negative word for Tool I say eat your own words and don't say a thing.... thank you.
0066214122|2.0|In no time at all you will be &quot;preying&quot; for relief.  One-third whine about the travails of a stay at home father, one-third info chunks gleaned by Dr. Crichton's research team and one-third loosely structured story, the novel is filled with logical incongruities and haphazardly conceived story development.<br />Having read many of the authors earlier works which provided enough of a scientific framework to create a believable possibility, Prey indifferently attempts to fabricate a storyline with apparently little interest in whether or not the &quot;facts&quot; presented as the building blocks of the novel fit together in any cohesive or particularly interesting manner.<br />It will probably make a visually interesting movie.  Don't waste your money on the book.
B00004T1NA|5.0|Here it is. The best album from Wilson &amp; co to date. Everything from The Beatles to Radiohead is here. Find out, what's in between. Favourite tracks: 2, 4, 8, 9...
B000002UAU|4.0|What is there to say about this album that really hasn't been said? Influential? Revolutionary? Legendary? We've heard it all and excepted it. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the LP that typically gets the most praise. A few of The Beatles' signature songs are here, such as Lennon's trippy 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' about a picture Julian drew, 'With A Little Help From My Friends', Ringo's second lead vocal, and the incomparable 'A Day In The Life.' Despite having quite a few great songs, it also contains quite a few not-so-great songs, such as the forgettable 'Lovely Rita' and poppish 'Good Morning Good Morning.' The songwriting isn't always consistent either, really, not as consistent as say, 'Revolver' or even 'Abbey Road' for the most part. (The album would've undeniably been stronger just with the inclusion of 'Strawberry Fields Forever' which was slated for the album, but was released as a single with 'Penny Lane'.) <br />The real star of the show; however, is producer George Martin who introduces so many tricks to this inconsistent album. His recording techniques and addition of many sound effects make this album still a sonic marvel today, not to mention his great brass and string arrangements. Just the way the songs flow into each other sounds fresh.<br />Despite having much better technology today, Sgt. Pepper still sounds great. It's relevence today is still huge. 'Getting Better' has been made famous by Magnavox and who could forget the legendary cover art (which is chocked full o' &quot;Paul is dead&quot; referrences)? Everybody from the Rolling Stones to The Simpsons has made referrences to Sgt. Pepper in a way. This is probably not the greatest rock album ever, or even The Beatles' best really, in terms of songwriting, but who cares? This may have been their most significant album in terms of what it introduced to the world of popular music. (And if it's not, then I'd put my money on 'Revolver'.)
B00005LB50|3.0|I could compare this set to a set like the Beatles Anthology...so I will.  The anthology is what this set should be..live music, long jams, interview interludes from key players and what about that unreleased Stampede album that I hear about?  This was a lost opportunity really but that's not to say there aren't worthy things on it.  The set has tons of demos, which I always like to hear and I actually appreciate the mono version of the first Springfield album on disk 4 after reading about the mix Neil and Stills made in Neil Young's &quot;Shakey&quot; Biography...It is really good and was put there as a means to contrast between the tinny version.<br />Most of the songs aren't exactly a revelation as fans will know the songs anyway but what is a revelation at times is how much better the demo songs sound recorded as a band as opposed to bits and pieces as with the first Springfield album.<br />I'm holding out hope for a live album in the future although I think half the problem there is that few decent quality recordings exist.  So yes, I'd recommend this but if you are a fan you will have bought this already probably...
B000063DIR|1.0|Ozzy had the audacity to remove Bob Daisley & Lee Keerslake from this remaster. How can you remove the man who wrote all of the lyrics and more than 1/3 of the music?  There would have been no \\"Flying High Again\\" or \\"Over The Mountain\\" for Ozzy to ride to glory without Bob's music & lyrics...in fact Bob has written the Lion's share of Ozzy's solo hit songs. Can you imagine if every band that broke up did this?  Will he replace Geezer & Bill Ward on the Black Sabbath albums next?  Don't support this childish, vindictive, behavoir.  He's ruined the 2 greatest Metal albums of all time while trying to re-write the history to bring himself more glory...and most importantly to him & Sharon....more cash!
0425152251|5.0|I just finished reading the Turkish translation of the book and I'm planning to get couple of English versions to share with my friends. <BR> The book will help you question your life and move up &quot;the furs of the Rabbit&quot; letting you see at least part of the big picture.<BR>I would definetely recommend reading this book at different times of your life over and over again.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Delicate yet powerful.  The story of an American and of America indeed. This is the one.  This is the movie to watch.
B00000F566|5.0|This DVD is one that you can watch over and over again. It really is an outstanding film and I'd recommend it to anyone anyday...if you haven't seen DIRTY DANCING, you're missing out! So watch it! Have fun.
630179513X|5.0|This conclusion to the hyper time-travel trilogy is the best of the bunch, sending Marty and Doc back to 1885 in the Ol' West. There are plenty of in-jokes and lots of cool special effects, but the film is mostly a western and works just fine as one. This time, Marty does battle with Biff Tannen's descendent, Mad Dog Tannen in a final confrontation that's too good to miss! I found myself constantly cheering on the heroes and booing the villains and just had myself a good ol' time. A must-see for sci-fi buffs.
B00005YXZH|1.0|this album is terrible.not worth the plastic to burn a cdr
B00005K9OX|5.0|\\"Die Hard\\" is easily one of the best action movies ever made. It's up there with other action classics like \\"From Russia with Love,\\" \\"Rocky,\\" and \\"The Hunt for Red October.\\" John McTiernan directed this thoroughly exciting film starring Bruce Willis as John McClane, NYPD cop who gets stuck in a hijacked building in LA. The bad guy is Hans (Alan Rickman), an evil terrorist whose primary goal is to open the vault of the Nakatomi building, where he will get 600 million dollars. But McClane is out to stop him. The action in this film is top-notch as well as the acting and pace of the film. It's a film of the highest calibre. Those looking for non-stop, relentless action and smooth one-liners, look no further! \\"Die Hard\\" is your choice.
0375703764|5.0|As others have commented, this book plays on one of our most basic of fears: the fear of darkness, being alone, and large, cold spaces. No one likes any of these conditions. When I first picked up the book and started reading it, I wasn't entirely sure if it was real or not. But even when I figured out that it was entirely fictional, that didn't do much to reduce the, for lack of a better or more descriptive term, terror. But not of the Boo jump out of the trees sort of way. More like in a psychological, screw you up for several weeks after you put the book down, sort of way. This is definitely NOT bedtime reading, lest of course you wish for horrific dreams of large, black stairways, and black great rooms with no chance for light.
0792839749|3.0|As many have already expressed, I loved this film growing up and never tire of watching it. I even met Sally Ann Howes two years ago when she was doing James Joyce's THE DEAD Off (then On) Broadway. I was planning on purchasing the DVD until I realized via the Amazon comments that the film was a pan and scan, not widescreen. A real shame. I taped it off Turner Classic Movies a few years ago, and out of curiousity popped in the tape, and sure enough it was in letterbox, widescreen format. So, until MGM releases a proper formatted DVD, I'd advise fans to keep an eye on the TCM schedule and tape it.
B00005QVJ2|4.0|the soundtrack is beautiful music, I play it a lot when I'm working on the computer, it's perfect background music.  <BR>the &quot;bonus&quot; CD I found to be pretty useless though, except for the movie trailer which was cool.  but the screensavers and wallpaper weren't that spectacular.
B000068TPN|2.0|I read the book before seeing the movie. IT was not a dissapointment, no, it´s a good movie, but something´s weird here...<br />In the book, Moore traces a brief background about the Vietnam situation (French dominance, American involvment, the politics of it all). In the movie, it is seldom mentioned. Also, half the book is about another battle fought two days later, at Landing Zone Albany, where American soldiers suffered even bigger losses than in Landing zone X-Ray.<br />Also, I´m positive that, in the book, Moore does not talk about himself killing anyone. The movie shows him killing a lot of vitnamese soldiers, some of them at point blank range... I understand that, since, the second battler would be completely wiped out for the movie, Wallace had to make Moore (Gibson) more dominant on the screen.<br />Just a note: what´s wrong with Madeleine Stowe´s mouth here?

B00006AG5N|5.0|a fantastic collection of Elvis' greatest hits.  something that everyone can enjoy, no matter what age.  these tunes are timeless!  definitely one of my favourite CDs.<BR>(as an aside, my brother played the &quot;A little less conversation&quot; remix at a wedding, and it brought the house down!  what a great tune)
B00003CXTG|1.0|When I heard that Randall Wallace had written it, I tought: \\"Well, this is gonna be great\\". I like war movies and I liked BRAVEHEART a lot. I had seriou suspicions because Ben Affleck was in it, but anyway I tought it would be a great movie.<br />Man, IT IS NOT! The film is polished to the limit, the love triangle is annoying, really ANNOYING. The way they used the Doolittle raid was a joke in the story. This is a heartless, big-budget movie, like countless others. The only scene I liked was the air combat over the Dover cliffs, between RAF Spitifres and the German ME 109. Very well made.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Although this film was released over 25 years ago, NETWORK is still revelant today. Winner of four Oscars AND four Golden Globes, NETWORK was also selected by the National Film Registry for preservation.<br />The film tells the story of Howard Beale (Peter Finch in a bravura performance), a faded news anchor for the lowest rated broadcast network. Two weeks before his scheduled departure, he declares during his nightly broadcast that he will publicly commit suicide. Everyone is shocked and stunned by this revelation. Management decides to immediately remove Beale off the air. After some persuasion by Max Schumacher (William Holden), longtime buddy and network executive, Beale is allowed on for one more broadcast. What Beale says then is equally shocking, but this time something unexpected happens. Because of what Beale said, his overnight ratings take a sharp boost.<br />Beale's sudden popularity boost attracts the interest of Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), an ambitious young programming executive at the network. Although she's not in the news department, she wants to develop a new program with Beale.<br />Within a short while, Beale has the hottest program on television. What follows is a series of surprising and provocative twists that will leave the viewer completely engaged and glued to the screen.<br />NETWORK is the work of a masterful writer (Paddy Chayefsky), who gets a credit similar to the overused (and often undeserved) \\"a film by\\" credit. Wisely, the filmmakers here know that the script is the foundation for this great film.<br />Chayefsky's craft is evident throughout this script. The structure is very sharp with many great lines peppered throughout the script.<br />This is not to discount the other talented people involved with this film. Sidney Lumet's direction is superb without drawing attention to itself. The cast, which also includes Robert Duvall and Beatrice Straight (the latter won an Oscar while only appearing in two scenes) works incredible well together. <br />Judging from some superficial similarities between the two films, NETWORK appears to be an inspiration for Spike Lee's ill-fated drama about television, BAMBOOZLED. However, the latter pales in comparison. While Lee didn't quite know how to balance the sensational elements in his script, Chayefsky passed with flying colors.<br />The DVD is a little light on features. It includes the original threatrical trailer (complete with CARA rating), chapter selection and subtitles. The only \\"extras\\" are a choice of both anamorphic (\\"widescreen\\") and full screen (\\"pan and scan\\") versions along with a quiz on quotes from the film.<br />While light on the features that many DVD buyers come to expect, NETWORK is still a must-see film. For anyone who wants to learn about film structure and pacing it's an excellent film to study. For everybody else, it's simply a VERY entertaining film.<br />See it. For fans of BAMBOOZLED, go see what Spike Lee could have accomplished with his film.
B00005JK8K|1.0|Nicolas is not chosing his screenplays correctley...<br />WINDTALKER should have been called EMPYTTALKERS. God, nothing happens here, it´s a total waste of time and money. They had a good plot concept, but they exploded it.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I was expecting great things from this, the second part of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  I had seen the trailer and watched the behind-the-scenes special, but nothing prepared me for what the movie would really be like!  I sat in the theater with my mouth agape!  Peter Jackson outdid himself in this one!<BR>The story begins with a flashback to Gandalf's epic battle with the demon (Fellowship of the Ring).  We find Sam and Frodo continuing their journey to Mordor, pursued by Gollum.  Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are tracking the Orakai that have captured their friends and fellow adventurers, Pippen and Merry.  Sauron and Saruman have joined forces and plot the destruction of man.  I don't want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it yet (or read the books), so I won't reveal any spoilers here.  As the heroes continue on their journey, we meet and get to know new characters such as Wormtongue, Eowyn, Eomer, and King Theodon of Rohir and Faramir of Gondor.  Gollum's role becomes more important as he agrees to lead Frodo and Sam into the land of Mordor.<BR>Readers of the book will be pleased at the movie version of Gollum.  This digital character is extremely advanced and believable as the multiple personality creature that craves The One Ring - his Precious.  In fact, at times you feel sorry for the creature.  At other times, you are actually fearful of him.    The battle scenes are above par.  Even better than those of the first installment.  You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat!  The special effects are so believable, that at times, you forget that some of this is actually CGI.  <BR>The length of the movie may deter some, but I actually heard some of the people in the theater complaining that they wanted MORE!!  Be warned, there are some scenes in this movie that I, a fan of the novels, did not expect to see until the third installment.  But I was not disappointed in the least.  I can only imagine what wonders Peter Jackson will wow us with in TheReturn of the King!
B000069CWE|5.0|After two months it was the best-selling remix album ever. If it earns a platinum certification, it has to be good, right? And, to do this good with no 'original' material requires a lot of work. The ironic part is, this is original! Tracks 2 and 15 are the only songs that have NO addition of lyrics. Every other remixed track from Hybrid Theory or the EP have added lyrics. For example, some songs like ENTH E ND, WTH>YOU, and PPr:Kut have rappers that add a verse to the song. Songs like Pu5hng Me A*wy, Frg/10, and Krwling have totally warped their songs. Frg/10 only has the chorus and a few words of the verse that are similar to the Hybrid Theory version. Krwling added Staind's Aaron Lewis and the song featured Phoenix on violin and cello. <br />Here is some more food for thought. Remix albums are very hard to create. You need to make a song sound good when you are working with material that has already been perfected and analyzed. NOW you need to come up with something different FOLLOWING the ideas of the original song. I think Linkin Park did a great job 'reinterpreting' their songs! Not to mention the great artwork! Keep it up! <br />ATTENTION>>>>>>> Linkin Park's new album (title yet to be released) is in stores in March 2003! And Hybrid Theory fans are in luck. <br />Mike Shinoda - \\"The new album sounds more like Hybrid Theory than Reanimation. I think the samples are cooler, the guitars are nice and heavy, and some of the stuff rob is playing is very exciting too.\\"
B000069HK2|1.0|The Used is the perfect name for this band.  Everything about them has already been used before.  Here are a few of other names they could have given themselves:  Originality Zilch, Deja Vu All Over Again or Broken Record.  The only reason this disc gets 1 star is for the number of times I will most likely listen to it.  Thank you Amazon for your recommending this disc when I purchased Zeromancer.  This is the reason file sharing works, if I would have had to pay for this disc I would have been [mad].  By the way Amazon, CDNow's format was much more informative and easier to browse.
B000002TYK|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that you can play start to finish without once feeling the impulse to skip over any songs, in fact, I'll even go so far as to agree with the guy who rates it higher than Nirvana's stuff! To be honest, I still listen to these songs on a regular basis whereas it's been months since I've played any Nirvana tunes. I think the key here is that Grohl captures the same manic intensity of his former band but with a more playful, upbeat style. The rock is as hard and fast paced as any fan could ask for, but instead of being all dark and &quot;edgy&quot; the songs are fun, even whimsical, with titles like &quot;Floaty&quot; and &quot;For All The Cows&quot;. And, most important, they still sound fresh, a true rarity in the world of popular music where musical styles can become outdated almost as fast as a carton of milk.
B000002HAF|5.0|Its great to know that lots of folks also think this one of the best...It's an amazing album that holds up to the test of time with raw power, rage, and intelligent songwriting without being pompous.  I bought this one when it came out right after high school and it has stuck with me as one of the best, and I have owned alot of albums.  I believe they were a 4AD band at the time and this just blew me away because most other bands on that label were british artsybands...amazing that from those roots it became probably THE influence for the grunge years that followed.  The anthems on this album are amazing, &quot;Broken Face&quot;, &quot;Where is My Mind&quot;, &quot;River Euphrates&quot;...I definitely put this one in my top five albums of all time.  I can't understand how people say it is boring since to me it reverberates with raw, unpolished energy.  It doesn't even sound like 80s punk music in anyway, or really 90's grunge music either.  It's just out there on its own. Timeless rock.
1563890119|5.0|This is one of the most disturbing things I have ever read.<BR>It is also one of the most brilliant.<br />This is the first Neil Gaiman book I read. After I finished it (two hours after I started it), I was both frightened and intruiged. I was drawn into the realm of Dreams, and I didn't want to leave so quickly. Needless to say, I will never think of nightmares in the same way again. This is an amazing read, something no fan of the fantastic should miss out on.<br />Oh, and for those Bible buffs out there, you'll never guess what became of Cain and Abel....
B00000099Y|1.0|This is not music.  Music is GOOD.  TOOL bad.  TOOL=no music.<BR>I'd rather listen to nothing than this CD.  Undertow (by TOOL) is better, but hardly.  This CD (AENIMA) contains almost NO music and consists mostly of eerie fog noises and curse words.  Hardly any guitar playing is involved, though I know that TOOL can play the guitar very well because it showed in UNDERTOW and LATERALUS.  What very small amount of singing on this CD is horrible, as Maynard (TOOL's singer) was always a lame, weak singer who I think has rabies or is constipated.  It sounds like it when he's singing.  The drummer is talented, but is rarely heard in this album.  The best song on here is 'introduction' which is a cool little circus-like organ piece which acts as an intro for a guitar solo on the next song that completely ruins the fun.  I payed [...] for this CD at a store because everyone kept saying how it sold a ton of copies on its release.  No one ever said anything about it being good at all.  Now I know why.  There is NOTHING to this CD that would make you want to listen to this CD except for the appealing cover artwork (which is mainly why I bought the CD in the first place).  Look elswhere.  Far elsewhere, like System of a Down or Rage Against the Machine, who don't abuse music like this CD harshly dose.
B00006GFAB|5.0|I've been listening to KISS ever since I was 10 and I absolutely love them and everything about them! When my mom turned me on to them, nobody knew that she had created a monster. This CD is awesome! I've always loved every KISS song right down to the last lyric, so you can take this review for any KISS album.
B00005JKWJ|3.0|Blade 2 doesn't disapoint.  There is Hong Kong action, a plot twist and did I say action?  Who is to decide the greater of two evils?  Blade must decide in the best interests of humanity.  Will the enemy of his enemy be his friend? Like it or not we all face hard choices and hope for a good ending.  One thing we can count on in Blade, his adamant integrity to the protection of the innocent, and I guess that is the best we can hope for in all peoples.
B0000507R0|5.0|Few DVD audio releases can equal the enormity of this classic work from the 70s. Though not apparent on the vinyl record and CD releases, Brain Salad Surgery was made for DVD audio. When I first played this release, I was absolutely floored by the vast sonic landscape that I fell into. Keith Emerson's avalanche of keyboard viruosity is more overpowering and breath-taking than ever; Carl Palmer's thunderous percussion reaches an entirely new level of power, revealing a standard of skill and athletics that few have equalled; and Greg Lake's soaring vocals have been given new life and greater urgency.<br />I hope that other ELP recordings appear in DVD audio. 'Pictures at an Exhibition' would an extraordinary addition.
B000068PQ0|2.0|If you are considering this album by The Flaming Lips but are not familiar with them I encourage you to pause before making that decision.  Q Magazine's placement of the song 'It's Summertime' on their CD of the best of the best of 2002 prompted me to buy it, listening to the entire CD causes me to put this on my most disappointing music purchase of 2002 can't place it in the dust bin of history soon enough list (tied with Kronos Quartet's African music CD).  Perhaps it is because the song 'It's Summertime' had raised my expectations unrealistically, but I was hoping for something like a 21st century version of an album such as Pink Floyd's stupendous 'Meddle.'  Or, with the clever title, a tribute to Jpop electronic musicians Cornelius, Takeko Minekawa, or Tomovsky; it is neither.<br />I would analogize the music on this album to a trip to the modern day dentists' office:  The experience is no longer painful, the whine of the drill no longer puts chilly fear into each of your body's sphincters and it no longer makes your head ache for days after the encounter.  Still, listening to this music CD is not much better than a trip to the dentist.  The music seems to meander aimlessly with listless langour dribbling from track to track for no apparent reason.  The vocalist's voice usually sounds feeble and girlish, as if he is afraid he will be boxed about the ears if he dares &quot;open up and shout it out, never worrying about a thing.&quot;  The backing band sounds as though it could be well, the vocalist and one other person strumming a clangy box guitar.<br />It occurs to one that the 'concept' behind this album is to emulate a television show about a robotic hero.  If so, The Flaming Lips has succeeded in creating an album that sounds like it was made for t.v.<br />The album is not entirely bad.  It has at least three good tracks (7, 8, 9) and these are good because they contain some good hooks; the vocal line is relatively strong and proceeds from point A to point B without hesitation; and because the backing music is cleverly constructed and doesn't drib and drabble from note to mote.<br />I give this album two stars because with over 100 positive reviews there must be some ineffable thing about this album that I am missing, otherwise just one star my friends.out hesitation; and because the backing music is cleverly constructed and doesn't drib and drabble from note to mote.<BR>I give this album two stars because with over 100 positive reviews there must be some ineffable thing about this album that I am missing, otherwise just one star my friends.
0385503954|4.0|This book is beautifully written...it is slow in the beginning, but it gets more interesting as the story goes on... not his best novel, but it is worth reading.
B000066744|5.0|This film speaks to us of our self-imposed limitations, insights, and perceptions. How do we view the world?  How does it view us? What are the notes we play and hear from others?  Amazing film; guaranteed to take you deeper inside yourself as well as lift you outside yourself with the haunting, exquisite music, camera angles and time-stopping shots. One of my all-time best movie selections.
B00003W8NM|4.0|OK, I have to say I enjoyed this movie. The visuals were great; performances the same.<br />Sure, there were some plot flaws and the ending did leave some to be hoped for, but show me a movie w/o ANY flaws and I'll sell you a bridge.<br />Lastly, I read many of the comments on here from 1 star and 5 star ratings. I honestly have to say: get over it.... It's just a film people. Watch it; talk about it, stand up, and continue on with life.....
B00006IUL6|5.0|Truly a masterpiece of light and shadowy gray, the region where this movie dwells.  Black and white, right and wrong are dceptively put on the back burner, where it doesn't belong, until the very end where poetic justice is served. Watch it in revulsion and marvel in its overpowering psychological subtlety and the perversions of men's minds and hearts.
B00001U03Q|5.0|The Clapton Chronicles covers Eric Clapton from 1981-1999 but is really cover &quot;Slowhand&quot; from 1985-1999. The hits It's in the Way You Use It, Forever Man, and She's Waiting covers him before Crossroads and every other track covers 1989-1999. On the Chronicles bonus tracks, you get Wonderful Tonight from 1991's 24 Nights and Hard Times from Journeyman(1989). This greatest hits of Clapton is great for the major hits of 1985-1999.
B00004Z459|5.0|OK, I need to admit. I've not heard the entire CD, just the singles. But really, the disc has changed my life. Thanks to all my friends crowing about how great all this new 'rock' music is (besides the Parkers, Creed and Nickelback immediately spring to mind), I've been getting into other types of music because I know I have better taste than them! I don't want to hear some whiny fellow telling me how he tried so hard blah blah blah. What I did get to hear in my follow-up to develop better taste were great artistes like Beth Orton, Massive Attack, Everything But The Girl, the Stone Roses, Lamb, Portishead, New Order, Joy Division, the Jam, Saint Etienne, Coldplay, David Gray, Gemma Hayes, Blur, Radiohead, Oasis, Elastica, Ryan Adams, PJ Harvey, Doves, Charlatans, Ash, Manic Street Preachers and so on. So thank you Linkin Park! Thank you Creed! Thank you Nickelback! Thank you blink-182! Thank you Avril Lavigne!
B00005YXZH|1.0|I must be getting really old.This thing stinks!
B00005YXZH|2.0|I bought this CD after reading all the great reviews and hearing all the hype about it. Ever since, I've been listening to it over and over, trying to figure out what people find so great about it. I'd advise you to download some of the songs first and decide for yourself. Like another reviewer said, don't buy into the hype.
B000001EG6|3.0|Several of these songs got a lot of airplay in 1970: &quot;Your Song&quot; (the big hit from this album), &quot;Take Me To The Pilot,&quot; &quot;Sixty Years On&quot; (very pretty nylon string guitar with strings intro), &quot;Border Song&quot; (typical Elton John piano intro). This early version of &quot;Grey Seal&quot; lacks the dazzling piano arpeggios that made it sound so great on the &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; album, it's a tiny bit slower, and the ending chords aren't as rockish as that later version, but it still sounds good, especially with the strings. All the songs sound decent on this album, though it's too much on the soft side for my personal taste, and none of the songs really grabbed me--&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; &amp; &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot; &amp; his other 1971-1974 era albums are much better in songwriting, playing, instrumentation, and lyrics, in my opinion.
0316776963|5.0|This could be one of the funniest collection of stories I have ever read.  This is this first (of a few) Sedaris books I've read, and a great introduction to himself, family and his unique humor that kept me engrossed in every word and page, and forced me to laugh outloud while reading.<br />While Sedaris' book pokes fun of family, the workplace and American culture, he simutaneously is warm and tender about certain subjects as well -- mixing the totally obsurd, while spilling his guts about a very personal section.<br />I personally, loved the section on his language lessons in France. I couldn't stop laughing. And as a New Yorker, his essay on riding the Paris, Metro was priceless.
0064407667|5.0|This book is great.  From the humor to story, it is an excellent choice for a reader 8 and up.  Lemony Snicket has a twisted imagination that really works.  This is just the start to a great series.  When the Baudilares recieve the news that their parents and home have burned down, the story begins.  The ending is extremely clever and humorous.  I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something read.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple PLan is one of the best new bands out there. They are easily the nicest bunch of guys in the business as well as being amazingly talented. The cd is loaded with tunes that are ridiculously catchy and fun. When i first got the cd, i listened to it non-stop for about a month. Its great, you can't get sick of it!
B00005JLRR|5.0|When I went to see Nemesis, I did not know what to expect..the previews looked quite good but we all know they can be deceiving...I did like the movie very much and I have been surprised at the hostility emanating from most professional reviews.  Once again, it has been made clear to me that one should make up his or her own mind instead on relying on so-called critics.  in short: go see the movie and decide for yourself.  The biggest surprise for me was the newest villain: Shinzon.  In spite of it all, it was so hard to dislike him: his pain and suffering, his bitterness and anguish were all too understandable.  In addition, he did not look like a villain but like a hopelessly lost tormented soul.  I even found myself hoping that Picard could find a way to help him. If one looks beyond the movie and its trappings, this movie can give a lesson in humanity. Did Shinzon deserve his fate in the end or was he a helpless product of his environment?  It is for the viewer to decide.
B000000WCA|5.0|I was looking through some old CD's today and came across this one. I used to LOVE this CD. Baby Spice is the best Spice Girl. She's the hottest and the most fun. Now this CD is one of the best pop album of all time! The Spice Girls are the ultimate Girl Group. I figured I would write a review while I was in the Spice Girl mood.<br />1. Wannabe - The best song on the album. Their first hit single and probably their best song ever!<br />2. Say You'll Be There - This is a really good song. It's a classic Spice Girls tune.<br />3. 2 Become 1 - This is one of my favorite Spice Girls songs. It's really good and is a classic.<br />4. Love Thing - This is a really good song, too. Geri sounds great in it.<br />5. Last Time Lover - This is also a really good song. It's not as dancy, but that's ok.<br />6. Mama - I love this song. Emma sounds awesome on it. You know it was her idea for this, you can so tell! I remember when they sang this at the concert. it was great.<br />7. Who Do You Think You Are - Wow! This song is great. Geri sounds great on it too.<br />8. Something Kinda Funny - This song is pretty good, too. I like the guitar-ish insturment sound in the background (mostly in the beginning.)<br />9. Naked - I like the little phone call bit on this. I remember Mel C at the concert before they sang this song (which is really good, by the way) \\"Well, since it is sooo hot here in Southern California, we decided to get NAKED!\\" The crowd went wild as they started discarding random pieces of clothing. I so wish I had snuck my camera in. Oh well.<br />10. If U Can't Dance - Probably my least favorite on the album. The beginning \\"rap\\" is kinda funny, though. It's all good!<br />All in all, this is a great debut by the Spice Girls. It's a must have for any fan of pop. The Spice Girls were a HUGE influence in music and certainly left their mark with this album. Enjoy!!!!!
B000000YBQ|5.0|Perhaps there are too many superlatives in jazz, but Bill Evans was a master.  This disc was originally issued as the second half of the trio's June 25, 1961 Village Vanguard gig.  The album has been acclaimed as a jazz masterpiece, largely because of the telepathic empathy between Bill Evans and bassist Scott LaFaro that characterized the session.  This empathy is apparent from the beginning of the first track &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; where Evans evokes the melody slowly, in almost lethargic phrases that are heavily punctuated by bass notes underpinned by Paul Motian's roiling snare.  The communication in this nonpareil trio approaches the mystical--moonlight on water.  The disc features two immaculate versions of Evans' &quot;Waltz for Debby,&quot; a complete transformation of the genre and among the most famous waltzes composed for jazz.  From the elegant exposition in the lilting notes of the melody through liquid chords to the firmly commanded and solidly swinging body of the song the trio moves as one.  &quot;Detour Ahead&quot; and &quot;Some Other Time&quot; recapture the impressionistic mood of &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; with bass and piano interlocked as though played by a single mind.  And again there is the powerful command of rhythm and harmony as Evans and LaFaro share internal harmonies.  The trio treats Rogers and Hart's &quot;My Romance&quot; at length in separate takes--the LaFaro bass solos are virtuoso displays and Evans is, as always, fresh and inventive in his harmonic variations.  The Evans solo in track 7 is a standout.  Evans picks up the tempo in Miles Davis' &quot;Milestones,&quot; exploring the possibilities of this innovative modal piece.  Evans swings powerfully, and LaFaro's virtuoso solo expands the possibilities of his instrument.  The trio's rendition of George Gershwin's lyrical ballad &quot;Porgy&quot; supports Evans' glorious exploration of harmonic possibilities abetted by LaFaro's mystic punctuation against a backdrop of shimmering brushwork.  The trio explores all the possibilities of Gershwin's classic.  Oh, by the way-highly recommended!!
B00006F7S4|5.0|This album is simply stunning. The music is textured brilliantly, and, as always, the lyrics are focused and very emotional. The first few times around this album won't be great, but as soon as you learn the words you'll find yourself wanting to hear it again and again. I really enjoy numbers 1,4,5 and 6, but the others are great as well.

B000002AZ8|5.0|I first bought Vitalogy on vinyl in November 1994. The packaging was probably the most exquisite concepts I have ever seen for album art and definitely deserved some sort of award. Jerome Turner was a genius. Even after having stopped following Pearl Jam for so many years, I still remember listening to this record incessantly when it came out and occasionally come back to this album to this very day.  Most of the record was done on the road touring for Vs. so it understandably deals with the issues that the band was going through at the time. Much like Nirvana tried to do on In Utero, Pearl Jam was at the apex of their popularity but they were losing control of the band and intentionally included Bugs, Aye Davinita, Stupid Mop, and Satan's Bed to throw people off. Two of the best songs on the album, Better Man & Immortality are sandwiched in between all that stuff. Spin The Black Circle is a pretty fun track and it surprised many including the band when it won a Grammy, who thought they were losing the audience by making it a single. It was the equivalent of releasing Blood from Vs. as a single. I will always remember the opening notes to Last Exit as being the perhaps the heaviest snare sound ever committed to tape. Immortality is the defining track on the album with a very orchestral sound and Mike McCready's haunting acoustic slide solo is surprisingly more effective than his traditional electric approach. However, other songs like Not For You sound unfinished as if they were being played for the very first time. Stone Gossard's end guitar solo at the end does not really develop as compared to the later live versions. Better Man sound is achingly spare with the organ and instead needs to have the live intro with the rim-shot. Whipping sounds too polished on the album, yet the song still rocks hard. Tremor Christ was probably the heaviest Pearl Jam song from the dark lyrics to outro guitar riff up to that point as well. Nothingman is a excellent sounding ballad that comes to rival the greatness of Oceans, Release, Indifference or Angel.
B00004RFFI|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I lost my VHS tape edition, and as soon as I saw the DVD edition at Blockbuster, I had to get it. I love this movie. The special effects are really mindblowing. No matter how many times I have watched it, it still keeps me on the edge of my seat. You'll find yourself watching this movie over and over just like I do all the time! It's a great addition to any DVD collection. The interactive menus are really cool. I love the making of Twister feature that shows how they brought the monstrous tornados to life. It's pretty freaky but luckily I don't live in Kansas or anywhere near it. You should really get this DVD, it's so awesome. It's the best weather related movie out there! You won't regret getting this. I reccomend it to anyone, you'll love it! Enjoy!
B00005B58Y|5.0|\\"Milestones\\" is very much a marker for Miles' music.  It was recorded in February and March 1958 as Miles' third recording for Columbia.  The quintet from \\"'Round About Midnight\\"--Miles on trumpet, John Coltrane, tenor; Red Garland piano; Paul Chambers, bass; and Philly Joe Jones on drums has been augmented by Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderly, whose lyrical, blues inflected alto works as an effective foil to Coltrane.  This is the sextet that was--among the best of Miles congregations.  The rhythm section was as tight and crisp as they come, and the songs recorded here have become jazz standards.  The record starts with the hard bop \\"Dr. Jekyll\\" with Miles' thoughtful solo followed by Adderly and Coltrane trading breaks at insane speeds.  Chambers' long arco solo is a bonus.  \\"Sids Ahead,\\" a composition reminiscent of \\"Walkin',\\" foreshadows \\"Kind of Blue\\" as a foray into modal forms.  Coltrane's solo is followed by an Adderly's swinging lines, where he plays blues with occasional citations from familiar folk songs.  \\"Two Bass Hit\\" is hard bop at tempo featuring tight ensemble work and a blazing Adderly solo. The title song, \\"Milestones\\" begins with a statement from Adderly followed by Miles' now classic solo containing the modal lines that he eventually explored at length.  Adderly's solo is lighter, bluesy, but it fits well with Coltrane's improvisation which is perhaps more consistent with Miles' evocation.  \\"Billy Boy\\" delivers the cherry pie a la mode.  This tune features the rhythm section, Philly Joe, Red Garland and Paul Chambers.  Garland's piano swings hard in this tight trio, and Chambers delivers another bowed solo.  The record concludes with an exemplary version of Monk's \\"Straight, No Chaser.\\"  Don't need a chaser with this one.
B00006M183|5.0|Every time they produce another CD, I think to myself, \\"They keep getting better and better!\\"  This also holds true for 'Riot Act.'  By the cover art, I thought I would hear a harder PJ than the past few CD's, but I was wrong.  They keep true to themselves, and keep true to their fans.  A definite 5 out of 5 stars!!!  ROCK ON!
B00005YUNY|5.0|Yes - Symphonic Live is IMHO the finest musical experience available on electronic media.<BR>I am a devoted fan from &quot;back in the days&quot; and this DVD really makes me feel like &quot;I must have waited all my life for this moment&quot;.<BR>It is wonderful, just wonderful.
B000000WCA|5.0|I was looking through some old CD's today and came across this one. I used to LOVE this CD. Baby Spice is the best Spice Girl. She's the hottest and the most fun. Now this CD is one of the best pop album of all time! The Spice Girls are the ultimate Girl Group. I figured I would write a review while I was in the Spice Girl mood.<br />1. Wannabe - The best song on the album. Their first hit single and probably their best song ever!<br />2. Say You'll Be There - This is a really good song. It's a classic Spice Girls tune.<br />3. 2 Become 1 - This is one of my favorite Spice Girls songs. It's really good and is a classic.<br />4. Love Thing - This is a really good song, too. Geri sounds great in it.<br />5. Last Time Lover - This is also a really good song. It's not as dancy, but that's ok.<br />6. Mama - I love this song. Emma sounds awesome on it. You know it was her idea for this, you can so tell! I remember when they sang this at the concert. it was great.<br />7. Who Do You Think You Are - Wow! This song is great. Geri sounds great on it too.<br />8. Something Kinda Funny - This song is pretty good, too. I like the guitar-ish insturment sound in the background (mostly in the beginning.)<br />9. Naked - I like the little phone call bit on this. I remember Mel C at the concert before they sang this song (which is really good, by the way) \\"Well, since it is sooo hot here in Southern California, we decided to get NAKED!\\" The crowd went wild as they started discarding random pieces of clothing. I so wish I had snuck my camera in. Oh well.<br />10. If U Can't Dance - Probably my least favorite on the album. The beginning \\"rap\\" is kinda funny, though. It's all good!<br />All in all, this is a great debut by the Spice Girls. It's a must have for any fan of pop. The Spice Girls were a HUGE influence in music and certainly left their mark with this album.
B000000YBQ|5.0|Perhaps there are too many superlatives in jazz, but Bill Evans was a master.  This disc was originally issued as the second half of the trio's June 25, 1961 Village Vanguard gig.  The album has been acclaimed as a jazz masterpiece, largely because of the telepathic empathy between Bill Evans and bassist Scott LaFaro that characterized the session.  This empathy is apparent from the beginning of the first track &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; where Evans evokes the melody slowly, in almost lethargic phrases that are heavily punctuated by bass notes underpinned by Paul Motian's roiling snare.  The communication in this nonpareil trio approaches the mystical--moonlight on water.  The disc features two immaculate versions of Evans' &quot;Waltz for Debby,&quot; a complete transformation of the genre and among the most famous waltzes composed for jazz.  From the elegant exposition in the lilting notes of the melody through liquid chords to the firmly commanded and solidly swinging body of the song the trio moves as one.  &quot;Detour Ahead&quot; and &quot;Some Other Time&quot; recapture the impressionistic mood of &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; with bass and piano interlocked as though played by a single mind.  And again there is the powerful command of rhythm and harmony as Evans and LaFaro share internal harmonies.  The trio treats Rogers and Hart's &quot;My Romance&quot; at length in separate takes--the LaFaro bass solos are virtuoso displays and Evans is, as always, fresh and inventive in his harmonic variations.  The Evans solo in track 7 is a standout.  Evans picks up the tempo in Miles Davis' &quot;Milestones,&quot; exploring the possibilities of this innovative modal piece.  Evans swings powerfully, and LaFaro's virtuoso solo expands the possibilities of his instrument.  The trio's rendition of George Gershwin's lyrical ballad &quot;Porgy&quot; supports Evans' glorious exploration of harmonic possibilities abetted by LaFaro's mystic punctuation against a backdrop of shimmering brushwork.  The trio explores all the possibilities of Gershwin's classic.  Oh, by the way-highly recommended!!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  Perhaps more than others have - but I thought it was pretty darn good as far as sequels go.  It has good character development built from the first movie (Agent J and his man vs. the world and himself story line), and the comedy was still rocking.  It was a little cheezy at times, but isnt that what these kinds of movies are for?  I recommend it!
B000002UR7|5.0|Lots of people call this Radiohead's &quot;weakest effort.&quot; I disagree; Radiohead has absolutely no weak efforts so far. Heavier and more textured than The Bends, this album focuses heavily on the sort of guitar-driven sound that Sunny Day Real Estate and Failure are known for. All the songs are great (which I can say about any other Radiohead album), however &quot;You,&quot; &quot;Vegetable,&quot; &quot;Thinking About You,&quot; &quot;Blowout&quot; and &quot;Creep&quot; especially stand out. &quot;Creep&quot; is an especially important number in the Radiohead catalog; one could argue that if it hadn't been such a great single, the band wouldn't have developed into one of the most experimental groups around as of now. If you're new to Radiohead, go ahead and pick this up; there's something for everyone on here. If you've liked Radiohead for a while then you NEED this CD! Get it as soon as possible!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is hilarious! The only thing is that you need to use the subtitles to understand the speaking. The jokes are hilarious! If you don't think it's funny, watch it again and it'll grow funnier and funnier! If you don't already own this movie, you should because it is really really funny. I guarantee that you'll love it. The extra features are really good, too. My favorite parts were the part with the Black Knight, the castle with all the virgins in it, and the killer bunny. You have to watch this movie, it is sooooooooo funny. I just can't say it enough! It's hilarious. You have gotta at least rent this movie, but this is definitely a film that you should spend money on to get this special edition. You won't regret it! Enjoy!!!!!
078401213X|2.0|Slightly like yesterday's soup, this tribute to Luis Bunel ['L'Age d'or', 'Un Chien Andalou', etc.] creepily pulls the viewer along its rather 'high-school' conceived plot - everything has a formula, everything reduces to numbers ....<br />Visuals are interesting but repeated - especially in the editing of the later &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; - although it's taunting to imagine what this director might have done to 'Solaris&quot; - [yes, there's also the obvious Kubrick kick - and quite a lot of Roman Polanski's &quot;The Tenant&quot; thrown in for good measure ...<br />Well, back to the drawing board .... but leave the ants to Bunel....
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has returned 3 years after her succesful self titled album with her real inner self in \\"Stripped\\". She starts us off with clips from MTV shows shes been on in Stripped Intro. She pumps the CD off with the amazing and hopefully 3rd single \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" featuring an amazing rap by Lil' Kim. \\"Walkaway\\" is a soft ballad which isn't her best. Lyrics are good though. \\"Fighter\\" is like #2 and #15 and is strong and hopefully a 3rd or 4th single. \\"Primer Amor\\" Interlude is the intro to \\"Infatuation\\" which is a good spanish flavored song. Love Embrace is the intro to the weak \\"Loving me 4 me\\". Now we see the soulful Christina in \\"Impossible\\" produced and written by Alicia Keys. Could do as a single. \\"Underappreciated\\" is another weak song. \\"Beautiful\\" is one of the most meaningful songs on STRIPPED and has a good message. \\"Make Over\\" is a bit of old school song and is my least favorite on the album. \\"Cruz\\" is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE she sounds so beautiful on this and I could listen to this song for DAYS! \\"Soar\\" is a weaker version of \\"Cruz\\". \\"Get mine get yours\\" is another favorite because it has the same vibe of sound like #2 and #4. \\"Dirrty\\" is probably the lamest song on here and is getting old. This song shows how much of a ... Christina cam sometimes be but yet it did so well on TRL. Stripped Part 2 is just a continuing of part 1. \\"The Voice within\\" is another weaker but meaningful lyriced track. \\"I'm Ok\\" might make you cry as you listen and you can here Christina whimper when she says \\"...and I'm Okay\\" and it hurts me to listen to her sing and use her beautiful voice talk about her abusive father. \\"Keep on singing my song\\" is the perfect way to end \\"Stripped\\" because it is one of those brighten up your day songs. I say if you love music - BUY STRIPPED!<br />(and who doesn't love music?!)
B00005JKQZ|1.0|I started watching A Beautiful Mind expecting to be wowed away by a deep look at overcoming mental illness. Instead, the movie was plodding, predictable, and dull. It's pretty obvious Nash is having delusions. The only mysteries are what he actually did that was important, and how he put up with Jennifer Conelly's overexaggerated agitation. The movie was made to win awards, and I have a feeling some audiences (and Oscar voters) just couldn't admit to themselves that a movie about mental illness could be just plain bad. Especially \\"beautiful\\" are the glaring omissions of Nash's other problems that make him seem a little less of a gentlemanly genius. It doesn't matter how many special features are on the DVD. If the movie is bad, they aren't going to save it.
B00005V9IK|5.0|This is a great movie! The special effects are brilliant. It's a really good plot, as well. When I saw it in theaters, my friends and I got all freaked out when they were vivisecting the live alien, but it turns out that that was really the only scary part in the movie! I have watched this movie so many times, it's great. It makes me feel good that I don't live in a big city like New York... maybe the aliens will skip over little ol' Salinas. Hehe. Anyway, this was a huge blockbuster hit and it's no surprise why. The cast was excellent and the special effects were really really cool! My favorite shot it when all of the RV's are driving through the white desert, it's really funny, but cool! The special features didn't realyl excite me that much, but the movie is still great. But the only thing is, what was the extra parts that they added in? I guess I'll have to watch the original cut to find out. I reccomend this movie to anyone, it's really great! I love it and you will too! You won't regret buying this. Enjoy!!![...]
B00005OAIE|4.0|So I finally took Lateralus out of the CD player and stuck in Room For Squares. Sprawled out on the sofa with my husband and had him rub my feet till i was in sleepy land. Couldnt find a better CD to do that to. Though not normally a fan of the elevator/light/cheesy/teeny bopper genre , this album  doesnt annoy me in the way that others do. It was relaxing. Peaceful. <BR>But as soon as I wake up, i'm putting TooL back in.<BR>;-)
B000000H3Z|4.0|Beneath the Remains is the kind of album I'd expect my friend Kijana to love.  He's sort of hyper and acts like no other member of his species.  Look into his eyes and you'll see pure mischief.  The guy leaps around like doesn't give a darn what others think.  I guess that's why people tend to like Kijana.  He's an original - conformity to social convention just isn't his thing.<br />Same goes for Sepultura.  Brazil has never exactly been a hotbed of metal activity, yet somehow the brothers Cavalera came up with the crazy idea of forming a death metal band in Sao Paolo back in the mid 1980s.  Their earliest effort, Morbid Visions, consisted of straightforward and generally unremarkable death metal, but when they released Schizophrenia in 1987 it became apparent that something powerful was brewing in Brazil.  Still, nothing could have prepared the extreme metal world for the release two years later of Beneath the Remains, an album of gargantuan guitar riffs and thunderous drumming the likes of which few bands at the time could match.  I can only imagine most of the thrash/death metal bands of the mid-80s quaking in their boots when this album dropped.  Heavy and uncompromising, yet somehow still surprisingly melodic, Beneath the Remains signaled that Sepultura had arrived on the world stage.<br />The title track serves to warm you up for the pummeling you'll get from `Inner Self'.  `Stronger than Hate' and `Mass Hypnosis' are beautiful slabs of noise.  `Sarcastic Existence' is absolutely crushing with its jagged riffs and what sounds remarkably like a dental drill towards the end.  How about the transition into the epic `Slaves of Pain'?  Any complaints yet?  I didn't think so.  Hey, the only reason this album gets 4 stars instead of 5 are two words: Arise and Roots.  It's pretty sick to even contemplate this notion while listening to Beneath the Remains, but Sepultura were destined to get even better.  On Arise, Sepultura took the template of Beneath the Remains andsomehow managed to improve on it.  Then on Roots, they took the templates of Arise and Chaos A.D. and smashed them to bits before creating something breathtaking and, of course, truly original.  Man, would Kijana love Roots.  If you wanted to make an argument right now that Sepultura were the greatest thrash/death metal band of all time, I wouldn't bat an eyelid.  <br />The loudest concert I ever attended was a Sepultura show at a club in NYC on their Chaos A.D. tour.  You wouldn't believe the number of Brazilian flags people were waving there - it was like half of Sao Paolo had flown up for the show.  It was crazy in there.  I'm telling you, if Kijana could have been there he would have flipped out.  I doubt they could have kept him off the stage, the rafters, or anywhere else in that club.  When someone is a true original like Kijana or Sepultura, don't mess with them - let them follow their muse and something beautiful will come of it.
B000002UAU|5.0|Some people feel the need to revise the stature this album holds in the pantheon of rock,not me! Every song is strong from the hard rock of the title track/opener to the childlike whimsy of Lucy,64,fixing a hole to the classic finale a day in the life. Not a weak link in the entire set,sure within you may drag on a bit but if your not averse to indian music it shouldn't be a problem. This is simply one of the greatest rock albums ever and no collection is complete without it.
B00003CXSM|4.0|This definitely proves to me that Jennifer Lopez is a good actress! She definitely needs to stay away from music. But this... this movie is really funny! The jokes are good, it has an overall nice atmosphere surrounding the movie. J Lo and the doctor guy have good chemistry. It's light-hearted and doesn't have nudity or profanity or anything, which a movie doesn't need to be funny. You should rent this movie, it's pretty good! I wouldn't buy it, but I would definitely see it again. I would reccomend that you watch this movie, definitely! It's not the best movie ever, but it's still pretty good. This is a nice movie to rent and watch by the fire, or... what the heck, just watch it, it doesn't matter what circumstances (unless your mild ... grandmother is hitting you over the head with a slightly roasted gourmet ham, THEN is the time you shouldn't watch the movie).  Otherwise, watch this movie and (as always) Enjoy!
0345448898|3.0|I have been a SF fan for 40 years. I am an open-minded Christian who is not easily offended, but it is clear there is an agenda here. This is well above average young-adult SF but some of the most virulent anti-Christian propaganda I have ever read. Read it before introducing it to your kids. If you chose to, then read it with your older kids and discuss it with them. It may lead to some interesting discussions if they have reached the age to start questioning their faith. I hope that was the author's intent, but I think not.
B00000K0EA|5.0|Elliot Carver, the main enemy of this movie, is very funny. He even mentions about a cheerleader in a Chicago motel room, imagine that! This is my favorite line of the entire James Bond film series (because I'm from Texas and in high school), and it's as nonsensical as the Three Blind Mice song from Dr. No (one guy hated that movie for that reason!)
B000002L5I|2.0|After hearing all the hype that Kenny Wayne Shepherd was SRV's heir apparent I decided to byte the bullit and give him a try so I bought Trouble Is and Ledbetter Heights. I tried to like him. I really did. I was hoping that his music would grab me the second he started playing and never let me go, just as Stevie Ray did those many years ago. As the first song was playing I thought,&quot;My God! Everyone was right! His sound is just like Stevie Ray's!&quot; Not as good, but I figured he did the impossible and  he had me grabbed. That thought only lasted for a few more songs and then I started getting bored with it.  Don't get me wrong, he is good, but he doesn't pour his whole heart and soul into his music, letting it just flow out of him; The way Stevie did. He just doesn't have the searing passion for music that Stevie had.<br />Another thing. I don't like Noah Hunt.  Noah has a beautiful voice but he can't sing the Blues. He should sing Elton John type of songs.  <br />Bottom line, if you like just OK Blues go ahead and buy Kenny's CD's but if you want to hear the GREATEST GUITARIST ever,(as all music critics have said) someone who put all of his passion, his whole heart and soul into his music, get your hands on all of Stevie Ray Vaughan's CD's,you won't regret it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a truly great movie! I first saw it when my Aunt and I went to Blockbuster. We saw it sitting on the shelf and thought it looked pretty good. We were wrong. It wasn't just \\"pretty good\\" it was awesome!... I mentioned it to one of my friends and found out that he loved the movie, too! I had to buy it and finally found it. I just don't understand why it is \\"why it is a little more money\\" here on Amazon.com . I got it for the price of a regular DVD. In fact, the store had 3 more copies all for the same price! Enough about price, though, let's talk about the movie. The movie has spectacular animation and a great plot. A prince is poisoned by a demon and is banished from his little town. He journeys and finds a town that produces iron and guns. A goddess/princess chick and these 3 cool talking wolves are trying to kill the \\"ruler\\" lady of the town because they destroyed the forest. In the end, I'm still not sure who really won: nature or the destructive humans. It's funny that Billy Bob Thornton was one of the characters (voice). This movie is great, a treasured part of any DVD collection. I reccomend it to anyone. The only people I know that didn't like it are my grandparents who are more into \\"classic\\" movies and those sort of older films. You won't regret seeing this movie! It's killer! Enjoy!
6305558167|5.0|I agree with the five-star ratings given to this film! It is one of my all-time favorites, and one of the few I'd consider buying in DVD (given that I own a copy in VHS). This movie presents one of the finest examples of scene- and music-editing ever, with my two favorite scenes being the very first and the very last of the movie (both played against the musical background of Wagner's \\"Sigfried's funeral march\\"). The first scene shows knights on horses coming out of the nightly mist, and the effect this scene had on me didn't have an equal until I saw the opening scenes of 'Saving Private Ryan', years later. The last scene, though, is one of the most poetic (and sorrowful) ever captured on film: a dying Arthur asks Percival to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake, task he first refuses... When Percival returns to Arthur, he finds he has been taken away by three muses of death, in a perfectly wagnerian epilogue...<br />As others have stated, the scenery of this movie is as close as it will ever be to the lyrical magic of the surroundings of Camelot.
B000002UCN|5.0|I don't know what everybody's problem is (who reviewed this album.)  It has George Harrison's best work with the Beatles, and as a solo artist, what more could you ask for?  Agreed, it wouldn't have hurt to add more songs to his solo career side, but other than that, it's great!  I only bought it because of the Beatles' songs, but with it, I discovered great Harrison solo songs (Dark Horse being my favorite.) <BR>I recommend this album to any Beatles fan (everybody)
B000002BYD|5.0|For me Pearl Jam is one of those bands that I won't let anyone say a bad thing about. But about the album - it's just out of this world. Maybe it's not better than the classic \\"Ten\\" but it's my favorite PJ album. First of all it's got incredible atmosphere and it's very homogeneous - songs are great lyrically and musically (of course). Great edgy \\"Brain  Of J\\" to begin, then beautiful song about marriage \\"Faithful\\", next the \\"No Way\\" with a kind of hip hop beat. Number 4 is the brilliant epic \\"Given To Fly\\" and then it gets even better with one of the best PJ songs and one of the best ballads I've ever heard - \\"Wishlist\\", more and more absorbing with every second, with every listen. \\"Pilate\\" starts like a ballad but sails into more rocking style, still I consider it as the one of the weakest songs on the album. Then we have the hit \\"Do The Evolution\\" great satirical lyrics, a great riff and enormous energy. \\"The Red Dot\\" is just sample of their experiments and is the only one you can skip. \\"MFC\\" is very rock song with beautiful lyric and catchy guitar, then comes \\"In Hiding\\" very haunting track, one of their best ever. \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\" with Eddy saying (rapping) the lyrics is the most depressing and downbeat song on the album, maybe not great at first, but it grows on you after a while. Closing ballad \\"All Those Yesterdays\\" is another very catchy and pleasant tune with a Beatles' spirit. On \\"Yiled\\" Pearl Jam made another step forward, they didn't fall into commerce nor into artistic self-abusion. They didn't record a overproduced or overdone, but an interesting and haunting album
B000000WFF|5.0|This is my second Spice Girls review for today. This CD is not as good as the original Spice Girls CD \\"Spice\\" but it still is awesome!!!!! The movie \\"Spice World\\" was also awesome and a great DVD to own. This CD was the second and last great CD by this marvelous group. They broke records and set new standards in a relatively short time. They came onto the scene in 1997 with \\"Spice\\" and followed it up with this CD.<br />1. Spice Up You Life - This is a great song, and a great one to dance to. It's really fun.<br />2. Stop - Hehe, I can dance to this. This is a really nice song to listen to. It's awesome!<br />3. Too Much - This is a great song, too! I really like it, it's one of my favorites.<br />4. Saturday Night Divas - This is like the first mention of \\"diva\\" I had ever heard. It's a really fun song. Victoria sounds really good on this. And i hate to admit that Mel C does, too.<br />5. Never Give Up On The Good Times - This is a classic Spice Girls tune and one that I will never forget. Love them girls!<br />6. Move Over - This song is kinda monotonous, but still fun. Generation Next! I like the little rhyme thing, it's fun.<br />7. Do It - This is another classic Spice Girls song! It's really good and one of my favorites.<br />8. Denying - This is a great song that really grew on me. I like it a whole lot.<br />9. Viva Forever - This is a nice little song. I bought the single (import) and it has a nice accompanying video. It's a faux Spanish style song.<br />10. The Lady Is A Vamp - This song concluded the concert I went to. It's really nice. The only thing is that on the tour they tried to replace Geri's great laugh at the end with Victoria. No, but I'm sorry that just isn't great.<br />Overall, this CD is awesome, you should own it. I can still listen to it years after the Spice Girls took over the world! It's really good and a must have for any pop fan. Enjoy!!!!!
B00005OWEG|5.0|In putting together his director's cut of Apocalypse Now, director Francis Ford Coppola has created a masterpiece. It may even be the best war film of all time.<br />Though it has been a number of years since I last saw the theatrical version, I could tell immediately that this version is the definitive one. The characters and their relationships are further explored and flushed out, and the journey down the river by a soldier (Martin Sheen) on his way to assassinate a renegade general (Marlon Brando) really feels epical. Full of beautifully photographed scenes matched with precision by a great soundtrack (the opening scene alone is worth seeing the film), it's hard not to get caught up in the movie. This is just as much a quest film as a war film, and the additional scenes help this incredibly.<br />The only drawback is the addition of the French Plantation sequence, which occurs near the end and grinds the momentum to a halt. A long dinner scene with Frenchmen has little to do with the plot line of the film. Just when the film should be building up to the end confrontation, it takes this leisurely detour.<br />But despite this, the film still manages to be incredibly powerful.  It tops my list of favorite war films I've seen, and could very well be the best in history. This expanded version should not be missed by any film connoisseur.
B000001E18|5.0|I'm not exactly a huge fan of U2.  Sure I like some of their classic hit songs (\\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"In The Name Of Love\\", etc...) <BR>In fact, the only reason I bought this CD was because I thought the cover looked cool.  And let me tell you, I'm glad I did!  <BR>I wasn't expecting a great album out of this, just something to brighten up my CD collection, and yes, so I could say I own a U2 CD.<BR>From the beginning to the end, this is without doubt, the best U2 album ever.  I recommend every single song on this album.  When you first listen to it, you won't ven believe that it's U2! <BR>Bono even steps aside, and alows The Edge and Johnny Cash a turn to sing.  <BR>There are so many funky bass riffs (\\"Some Days Are Better Than Others\\") <BR>The chorus to \\"Lemon\\" is so catchy that I can't get enough of it.<br />I personally recommend this CD to anybody who enjoys listening to music and recommend \\"Scott Weiland- 12 Bar Blues\\" to anybody else who enjoys this album because they both have a simular style (one that they made up.)
B00006CXSS|5.0|My girlfriend wasn't really excited when I said I wanted to watch Band of Brothers. She thought it was just another WWII movies. but that changed after the first episode. many of the ten episodes and &quot;we alone stand together&quot; brought tears to her eyes. <br />You cannot go wrong getting this DVD set. You will definitely apprepriate the amount of effort they put in making this series.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This is a great movie, with Angelina Jolie starring as Lara Croft. The movie follows Lara on one of her typical quests - find something, beat up some bad guys along the way, save the world... Nonetheless, it's a great movie. Angelina is brutally hot and that alone just makes the movie great. Now, it's not guaranteed that you'll like the movie if you simply like the game. The story is fun, energetic, and exciting! The DVD extras are really good, too. The deleted scenes are awesome. I think they should've left the scene where Lara flips the card around the guy's head instead of the one where her ex-boyfriend person is in the shower. But that's just me. And Lara's house... ahh! It's amazing! I want to go live in it, but maybe a miniature version, haha. I reccomend this DVD to anyone, it's great! You won't regret this purchase! Enjoy!!!!!
0811826848|5.0|This book is the ultimate guide on the Beatles entire career, the obvious reason for this being that it was written by the Beatles themselves.  This thick volume is a must have for any Beatle fan.<BR>I am a huge fan, but when I saw this book in the store and slipped open a page, it looked like it was just a transcript for the Beatles TV program.  How wrong I was!<BR>Sure, every once in awhile, you will read words that are in the Anthology TV documentary (like when Ringo talks about the police guard in Montreal) but it is a rare occasion.  This is mostly all new material.<BR>This book really gives a lot of information.  The part that was most interesting was when they talked about their days in Hamburg.  This was great to read about because it really showed me where the beatles came from.  This time period is rarely discussed in other Beatles books.<BR>But, my favorite thing about this book is how they so expertly weaved John's words in with the other 3 Beatles.  It was almost as if he was there helping them write it. His thoughts were sometimes haunting, sometimes funny and always a pleasure to read. You can tell that he is sorely missed by Paul, George and Ringo.<BR>Please get this book!  It has an amazing collection of pictures and collages, details about the creation of such albums as Rubber Soul and The White Album, thoughts on the beginning (and the end) and a chance to see what the Beatles themselves made of the 60's.<BR>A splendid time is guarateed for all!
6305165912|5.0|Awesome!  If you like Coen stuff you will love this.  I think this is their best film.  I do have one complaint.  On the cover of the DVD it describes the carpet as the one that made the room \\"hang together.\\"  Did the person who wrote that ever see the movie.  The rug \\"tied the room together.\\"  If you are going to quote from a movie like this at least get it right, especially on the box.  Though the box was written by ..., the movie is genius.  Get it and watch it over and over.  It just keeps getting better.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Rather than reiterate what has been said below about this film (in it's favor of course) I only wish to support it as fully as I can. JAWS is indeed one great movie, and no creature film has touched it since. It is a complete joy to watch. I love the dialogue exhanges, they are never cheesy and always full of wit and believability. The attack at the end where the fish kills the captain remains the most shocking and graphic death scene I've seen on film (and this movie is only PG) Watch it. Buy it. If you havent already, whats the problem?
0790729970|3.0|I'm not a big Jim Carrey fan, but of all his movies, this one was clearly the most enjoyable. This is Cameron Diaz's first block buster movie, and I must say, she did an excellent job. Although she is a beautiful woman, I just couldn't believe how sexy and gorgeous she was in this movie. Her skin tone was flawless and glowing, but then again, this was nine years ago.       But I think the Jack Russell in the movie was absolutely the cutest and reminded me of Eddy from Frasier. Without the pooch, it would not have been as entertaining.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This was everything i hoped for and much much more!!! I highly recommend this for anyone who loves Slipknot or just remotely listens to them.  I have yet to see them live and if i never get to this dvd took care of most of that experience.  All i can say is they say they are the most explosive band ever, and this prooves it TOTALLY!!!
B00006JJ2Y|3.0|You buy it for Reed's Lenny Bruce styled rants.  They're hilarious and you will enjoy hearing them and playing them for your friends.  You won't play the album to enjoy Reed's excellent music.  For that try &quot;Rock and Roll Animal&quot; (one of the finest live albums recorded of anyone!) or if you already have that, then the Live in Italy cd.  So you buy it for the humor, Lou cursing Robert Christgau among many others, that's great, but by all reports much of that has been edited out.  I wonder what Lou-then would have said about this release?  I say Nuts!
6305090564|4.0|Yeah this film is pretty flawed all right. God Knows I've written some biting reviews of movies of the same calibre. But hey, it's not every day that a movie about a giant squid-thing from the abyss attacks a ship, which just so happens to be MY cup of tea. It certainly isn't everyone's. I recommend at least renting it. There's a very good chance it'll entertain you
0060977493|5.0|This is a great novel. Like most first novels, it is heavily autobiographical and the child character Rahel is so clearly Roy herself that she is a completely plausible character with whom the reader can empathise. In fact, the book's strength lies in its portrayal of the family, its weakness is the story.<BR>The God of Small Things is often very amusing; there is a lovely passage where a child recites Lochinvar with a Malayali intonation and pronunciation. All in all I think this is one ofg the best books I've ever read...
0066214122|4.0|A thought provoking novel that creates a very believable possible scenario as to what man's capabilities could create. We have plenty of current and historical examples of what can happen when mankind gets ahead of itself. I thought the characters were well done in this novel, in that their reactions to the extraordinary circumstances were quite realistic. <br />If you enjoyed this novel check out the novels SILICON SECRETS by Catherine Burr and CLONED LOVE by Thorne Peters.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The reason Norah's debut CD has nearly 600 reviews in only 10 months is simple: she's great, and the disc is darn good. I agree with some of the other reviewers that having two or three up-tempo selections among the 16 would make it even better. However, this is mellow, but never dull. I also agree with some other comments that her work on the famous standards \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" and \\"Nearness of You\\" is even better than what she shows on the less-familiar tunes, so more \\"classics\\" on her next release might be a decent idea. Still, overall, this is a wonderful item. Other highlights for me include \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Seven Years\\" and especially \\"Turn Me On\\", which is one of the sexiest songs I've ever heard. If you like girl singers who have great diction and phrasing and taste and sensitivity and sublety, buy this now. She is jazz, she is R & B, she is \\"pop\\", whatever that means anymore. Definitely adult contempory. And adult classic as well.
0201633612|5.0|I read it sitting under a palm tree on the beach over last summer. All I can say is that it takes a REALLY good book to make me not even notice the girls in the bikini's.<br />I'm only a junior programmer but I can honestly say that reading this book was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life.I think all junior programmers should read it as soon as they can get their heads around the ideas in it. Designing good software is really hard and the earlier you think about design the better. It gives you a wonderful perspective where you are headed while you are learning.<br />Big thanks to Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides for writing one of the best books of any kind I have ever read.
0316666343|2.0|I was surprised that this book was so simplistically written. I thought some philosophical and even metaphysical aspects of life and death would be delved into, but this is a sing songy children's book that at times is just plain annoying. The character development ranged from shallow to non existent and the heavenly narratives by the dead girl are weak. If you want some originality and a thought provoking read pick up PREY by Michael Chrichton and CLONED LOVE by Thorne Peters. This novel I thought was just drivel.
6304082428|5.0|This is the most brilliant adaptation of the famed Jane Austen book ever made. It is long, but true to the book. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  was criticized widely for staying true to the book, but P&amp;P has escaped such criticism. Perhaps because of the creative nature of the actors and obviously, the director.<br />Colin Firth became an overnight heartthrob through his very absorbing, as well as attractive, portrayal of Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle's performance was quite memorable as well as much of the cast. The film doesn't highlight any one character, outside of the leading Mr. Darcy and Miss Eliza Bennet, over any other. What makes a great film is when you try to imagine a film without other characters. If you find yourself saying something along the lines of \\"it just wouldn't be the same without ____ (naming nearly every character),\\" then you must admit that everyone in the film has succeeded.<br />Each actor portrayed each character perfectly. Mrs. Bennet was very loud and obnoxious. Lydia was childish and embarrassing. Miss Caroline Bingley was elegant but spiteful. Miss Georgiana Darcy was kind and gentle. Mr. Collins was sickening. Lady Catherine was not only frightening, but certainly condescending. It doesn't matter which actor or character you look at, they were all very believable.<br />Cinematography could have been better. It does well enough but many shots could be better imagined with a great cinematographer. However, this was a miniseries and not an actual feature film so the flaw is certainly excusable. Costumes and sets were beautiful. The grandness of Pemberley was exciting to see.<br />The most interesting aspect of the film was its influence on its viewers. P&amp;P led to a sudden Jane Austen revival. Suddenly, more Jane Austen books were being sold, more Jane Austen movies were being made. It was referred to as `the Jane Austen bug' and the credit for the biting went to this film. P&amp;P was enjoyed by all genders, ages and cultures. Fan fiction, from modern to regency, began to pop up on the net everywhere (usually fiction relating to Mr. Darcy's feelings, which is interesting). Some fan fiction even made it to a publisher, became a bestseller, then was made into a film with the very same Colin Firth playing Mr. Darcy in the fan fiction known as Bridget Jones's Diary!<br />So to say the least this film is indeed a classic. It has had a great influence in the lives of its viewers. It is well worth your precious time to sit and watch it in its entirety. You won't find that it was a waste. In fact, I'm sure you'll find yourself watching it over and over again.<br />I give it a whopping 5 out of 5. If I could, I'd give it a 10 out of 5. It deserves no less.res.

B00005JKZ3|3.0|and those of you who do, may need to find something else to occupy yourselves besides watching movies. That was five freaking years ago, people! It was a better than average comedy meant to go thru one end of yr brain and out the other, not stay there as if it were something of consequence. And so it is with MIB 2,smartly clocking in at 1:25 and delivering the laughs you expect. I wouldn't buy it, but if you are normal, you will like renting it. If you think you are Roger Ebert, you will be offended. And that is your four bucks, and your problem.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This film is perhaps the most perfect evocation of the dreaming mind ever created, with the possible exception of Lynch's own &quot;Eraserhead,&quot; and Bunuel's &quot;Le Chien Andalou&quot; and &quot;Discreet Charm of the Bourgoisie.&quot; It has the only nightmare scene I've ever watched in a movie that was as scary as my own. It refines the elements the director pursued in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; while taking a more subtle and in many ways, more troubling approach. In one sense, it is an old story - a young person trying to become a star in Hollywood and failing disastrously. But that is only the tip of the iceberg of madness created by this dark and chilling masterpiece. This is truly a rare work of genius by one of America's greatest living artists in any medium.
B000062TU1|3.0|Harry Potter was and still is one of my favorite books.  When the movie came out I was exstatic!  Harry Potter on a big screan.  Then the movie came out.  There I was in line at the huge theater with all of my friends.  We got to the movie and sat down waiting for the amazing movie to come.  That never came.  I was expecting something more like Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars, not a little kids movie.  After the first scene I almost fell asleep.  One of my friends poked me when Daniel Radcliff (Harry) came on for the first time.  I looked up expecting some super hot guy!  Boy was i suprised when I saw a &quot;little kid&quot; in dorky glass' and SWEATERS on stage.  I understood the glass' but the sweater bugged me through out the movie.  In the book you got the impreasions that the kids wore robes, like you would imangine most wizards and whiches to wear.  The uniforms looked like prep school uniforms with ties and knee socks.  Maybe it's like that in England, but I don't think so.  My favorite character was Malfoy.  OK I go for the bad boys, but he was a great actor and was hilarous.  I couldn't wait for the duel between Harry and Malfoy.  But they never even talked about that.  also Hermione wasn't that bratty at all.  I would have liked her as a freind.  She never did anything wrong.  Ron was very loveable and funny, but should have had more lines.  AND WHERE DID THE ROMANTIC PART COME IN AT THE END?? Harrys supposed to like Cho Chang....not Hermione.  That was a big mistake.  Also there wasn't any action.  I have watched the movie twice and I know everything that was and is going to happen.  They made it so predictable.  Sorry I may be a snotty fashion obsessed teen, but I was expecting a lot more from this movie.

B00005JLF5|5.0|I've seen a review about how bad deep space nine is because it doesn't really move often with most of the story taking place on a space station. I disagree that it shouldn't have been made. Instead i say that this is what Star Trek needed very badly. the original series, the next generation and voyager all have the same similar theme.  A Spaceship bouncing around the place and never really staying in one place to learn about it.  Think about it how much can you really learn about a culture in less than a week? yet very few episodes actually show any of the star ships staying very long to get a more complete show of who they visited, and how those people come to be who they are.  Deep space nine was a jump from this in that you pretty much stay in one area and get a chance to become closer to a non federation culture the bajorans and to a lesser extent the cardassians. I question why Star trek doesn't have more unique series like this?  Instead of having series after series of Federation ships flying around why not have a Romulan series taking place after the Dominion war?  Perhaps a star ship which through the series leads to the Romulan people turning on their culture to grow?  How about a Klingon series? or an Andorian Series? Something to get deep into the peoples motivations and to show the growth of what happens to them and how they change, like Deep space nine did.
B000075BFK|5.0|Tupac is by far the most talented artist ever to touch the mic. I really do enjoy this album very much so. I've been a Pac fans since the early 90's. Pac never disappoints. This is the only artist and maybe a couple others who I spend money on. R.I.P. Tupac Shakur.
1572522232|2.0|I realize I am in the minority and that Suspiria is well-reviewed by many, but I found it to be a totally amateurish effort.  The effects are awful (fake attacking dogs, bats on strings, and blood that looks like day-glow tempera paint.)  It is stylish, but the colored lighting is overdone and the whisper and scream filled soundtrack gets annoying... The plot is disjointed and uncompelling, and the ending is unsatisfying...I can't believe that people compared this to the Exorcist and Shining.
B00007DWRZ|5.0|Tribalistas is such a fantastic recording!  There are five or six instant hits and several dreamy songs.  The songs are so catchy you won't be able to get them out of your head.  Marisa's vocals are her best yet and she always works so well with Carlinhos and Arnaldo.  The lyrics are unique (get a Brasilian friend to translate them for you!) and the melodies charming.  Like the best of Brasilian music it feels like they are playing at your own party!  Don't miss this one!
B000067J1H|5.0|Fight Club, a Movie with a Message. Definitely 5 Stars. What more can I say, you know the first two rules. As for Clam Chowder, I will never look at a bowl the same.
B00006JDVV|2.0|I must give this movie a bad review because of the deceptive marketing the poster designers used to get me to see this movie. On the posters I saw the dragons flying from military hellicopters ( like the hellicopters in the movie Godzilla ). There is only one single hellicopter in this entire movie and it is a reconasance hellicopter, not a fighting one. Here are my other complaints:<BR>1) The ending is very cheesy<BR>2) We are never given an explanation on how the dragons were able to stay alive underground.<BR>3) There are no landmarks to make it seem that it is really England.<BR>4) In order to save mankind they must kill one particullar male  dragon out of the many 1,000 female dragons. And it takes them an hour and a half to figure that out. Please, give me a break!
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters, Inc. is another triumph of computer animation from the wizards at Pixar.  As with the Toy Story series, the plot is taken from a &quot;what if?&quot; scenario in a child's imagination.  What if the monsters (whom everybody knows dwell in childrens' closets and under their beds) in fact live in a parallel world to ours? <br />Monstropolis City is powered by energy garnered from children's screams, which are collected by the workers at Monsters, Incorporated.  James P. Sullivan and his sarcastic assistant Mike are Monster, Inc.'s top scarers, but when Sulley inadvertently lets a small girl into the monster world things start to go awry.  Monsters believe that human children are highly toxic, and in their efforts to put little Boo back where she came from, they uncover a fellow worker's sinister plan to revolutionise the scream-collection industry.<br />One of the few down sides of the film is that at times it is just a little too cute, and Sulley definitely works best as a strong and straight-forward good-guy, as opposed to his attempts to be a moraliser and emotion-analyst.  His computer-generated fur though is incredible.  Over one million hairs have been animated to move realistically in response to anything from a light breeze to a Himalayan snowstorm.<br />The concept of a factory that has an exact replica of every child's closet door, and that of monsters living in a world not all that dissimilar to ours is certainly clever; but it is also the little details - such as a &quot;Grossery Store&quot; and &quot;odorant&quot; (rather than deodorant) - which really make the movie.  Although the ending is a trifle schmaltzy, this is a film that kids will love, and adults won't mind watching again and again.
B00004XMTC|3.0|I remember watching this film several years ago, and I detested it. Recently I viewed it again, and while I found it is somewhat entertaining, 'Thunderball', one of the best Connery films, is still far superior.<br /> To start, Sir Sean Connery does look a bit old for the part, but still gives a fine performance. Kim Basigner is passable as Domino, and Fatima Blush ( the villainess role, played better by Lucianna Paluzzi in the original) , while somewhat overacted by Barbara Carrera, she at least manages to be memorable. One of NSNA's biggest flaws is Klaus Maria Brandaeur as SPECTRE agent Largo. He has none of the menace or charisma of Adolfo Celi in the original, and does not come off as a very convincing villain. The other chief problem is that the movie manages to be both inconsistent and overlong. The action sequences range from decent (the shark diving) to almost abysmal (Health spa, motorcycle chase). Worst of all, the spectacular, climactic underwater battle in 'Thunderball' is replaced by a boring gunfight. And for every enjoyable scene (the cigarette case gag) there is a stupid one to complement it (the childish videogame duel). I don't think it was necessarily a bad idea for the screenwriters to veer away from the traditional Bond games (cards, etc.), but a videogame! Couldn't they think of something better?!?!  <br /> Overall, NSNA is not a bad film at all, and certainly is watchable. However, the inevitable comparisons that come with remakes to their originals do weaken the film.
0440224764|4.0|The Partner tells the story of Patrick Lanigan, an ex-partner at a firm who has been on the run for four and a half years after faking his own death in a car wreck and stealing $90 million from his law firm. The story picks up with Patrick being caught in Brazil, and the fun begins as the reader is slowly drawn into Lanigan's world, before and after his \\"death\\".<br />This is a strong novel, although not among Grisham's best. It's interesting to see the ways in which the legal system are manipulated, and which deals are struck and how, even if there is little doubt from a hundred pages on as to what kind of person Patrick is -- and therefore how the questions about his past are going to be answered. Patrick also seems a little too smart to be bought at face value (DNA tests of his daughter? bugging his own office?), but I guess novels are, at heart, romanicized reality at best. The Partner doesn't fully investigate everybody's fantasy of taking a vast amoung of money and running to an exotic locale, but it comes close. When all the facts are laid on the table, you'll wonder whether you would have done things any differently. And, as always, this Grisham is an easy and fast read.<br />Very enjoyable.<br />Matty J
0451207521|5.0|If you are looking to become totally engrossed and absorbed, swept away to another era, this is the novel for you.  OK, so I am not some book critic who can go into every detail of why this book is bad...quite the contrary!  I was amazed at how it captured me!  It's the enjoyment of reading..to become paralyzed with interest.  Rarely do I pick up a book and not put it down for hours on end.  This one did that to me. Predictable??  Not in my opinion..OK, maybe if you read alot of books on 1944 WWII France/Germany/Britain...maybe, but I haven't..so to me it was fresh.  I like an eclectic mix of whatever tickles my fancy at the time...and this one hit the nail on the head.  No complaints!!  Loved it!!  Ok, so there was ONE incident of homosexuality..BIG RIP!  Yes, there are incidents of torture, but...it was WAR, people..this IS what happens! War is UGLY!  But, this book is really, really good!  See for yourself.
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi tells the story of an Indian boy, Piscene (Pi), the son of a zoo owner, who becomes stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger after a shipwreck which kills, among others, his entire family.<br />I don't think there's any way to describe the story further than that. It has to be read to be understood. Read it!<br />In the end, the story is more than simply a story of overcoming the odds or unusual circumstances. Finishing this novel is like having your eyes opened to a new aspect of humanity. I tend to take a more philosophical mindview, so I wasn't overly swayed by the book's claim that it can make you believe in God (we should always believe what we feel to be true, not what makes us most comfortable, in my opinion), but the book is a searing look at human savagery - and more importantly, how we deal with it. The book's metaphors run deep, although I know I'm going to have to read this novel again to fully grasp them all.<br />And don't be intimidated by the book's lofty spiritual claims. This is not a theological book - it's simply a book about how one boy comes to view the world. Faith is used in a liberal spiritualistic sense, not a religious one.<br />All in all, this is a book not to be missed.<br />Matty J

0380977788|4.0|I've read all of Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics and his novels, but this venture into young adult horror/fantasy resembles Roald Dahl or C.S. Lewis more than Gaiman's adult work.  Few of the standard Gaiman obsessions appear here, but his fine writing and subtle humor remain.  This is an old-fashioned girl versus witch tale but in a completely modern setting.  Despite the whimsical supporting characters, the story would definitely be too frightening for small childrens.  McKean's occasional black-and-white illustrations help set the tone for this new sort of Gaiman opus.  Well recommended for fans of Harry Potter and Lemony Snicket as well as Gaiman.
B00005JL78|4.0|\\"Minority Report\\" is Steven Spielberg's second foray into Sci-fi in a row, following last year's \\"A.I.\\" The famed director made his mark in this genre with \\"ET\\" and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\". Today we have a more mature Spielberg, albeit one still obsessed with gadgets. The themes are darker, more complex, more ambiguous. The wonder the younger, rather naive Spielberg held for technology has turned to suspicion. The earlier films were more accessible and certainly drew larger audiences, but his current work does more to cement his reputation as a master filmmaker, as well as a master of the technology he now cautions us about.<br />\\"Minority Report\\" takes place half a century from now. A genetic experiment has created 'precogs', a small group of people who can see a murder before it happens. Computers can read their thoughts, and by using these, the government has been able to establish its Pre Crime division. In Washington DC, the murder rate has fallen to virtually zero, and there is a big push to use this program nationwide. Pre Crime's chief detective, John Anderton [Tom Cruise] believes the 'precogs' are infallible until the day they give his name as the soon-to-be murderer of a man he's never heard of. What ensues is a thrilling story of a man on the run who is caught up in a web of mystery and deception.<br />There are some flaws in the movie. These include a couple of rather large plot holes, some improbable escapes, and the tendency to have the computer generated special effects make the hero jump higher and fall further than is humanly possible. What a master like Spielberg is able to do it to succeed despite the problems inherent in a project. He is able to add layers which distract, intrigue and challenge us. He can take a present day phenomenon, such as the explosion in media technology, and imagine where it might take us in the future. He can take an ordinary, familiar action hero type and make him memorable. He can make us think while alsoentertaining us.
0790729725|5.0|this movie is awesome. this and the godfather are definitly the best mafia films ever. but as the godfather glamorized a life of crime, this gives the real facinating truth.<BR>    liotta, De Niro, and pesci all give great performances, and ofcourse scorrsese is one of the best directors of our time. so i seriously reccomend this movie to anyone.

B00005MAM2|5.0|My Storyline Analysis:<BR>Akira has a convoluted plot. In my opinion the storyline voices the author's rendition of the world, society and humanity in his own view. Only watching the story once, and without another run-through, I would say the quintessence of the story is a contradiction or paradox of humanity. We are able to do much good (like the 3-powerful children), but we can also do great harm (the member of the gang dude). In my opinion, the author suggests that we should question our own actions and motives to determine if we are like one of the children or the gang member. This story indirectly is an impetus to one's journey inward. The story ends with a rebirth and the author's optimistic outlook in his final words.<br />Buy this movie if you want to challenge your acumen and get a different person's perspective on our contemporary world!!!<br />-Go AP Lit!-
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I was in a hurry while shoppping, so I grabbed the first CD I saw. I had never heard of the composer, so I begin to regret buying this score. All that regret faded into the background when the first track started. It was simply stunning!

0151008116|2.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" begins with the establishment of a 'frame' narrator  (à la Conrad), and then proceeds with the development of a young and naive protagonist (Piscine 'Pi' Molotor Patel) who has a penchant for religious syncretism.  Author Yann Martel adds a set of idiosyncratic secondary characters, and puts all of this in an intriguing setting (Pondicherry, India) with a focus on a fictional zoo operated by the protagonist's family.  There are a few false notes here and there (e.g. a set of bourgeois, conservative parents naming their son after a swimming pool;  the unlikely acceptance by these same parents of their young son's desire to practice three religions simultaneously...), but these lapses are eclipsed by the promise of the themes which are introduced:  i.e. the viability of a syncretic religious outlook in the modern world, and the social, environmental, and psychological relationships between humankind and animals.<br />Having introduced the reader to this impressive array of elements, Martel shifts into low gear while trying to think of something dramatic to do with them.   As he does so, the novel begins to bog down with tangential material.  Some of this is meant to serve as foreshadowing for the human-tiger relationship which will be explored in Part Two, but much of it, particularly the parts relating to religion, basically leads nowhere.  <br />Part One drags on to the hundred page mark, at which point Martel decides to cut his losses.  He discards about half of the secondary characters by leaving them ashore in India while Pi and his family embark on a cargo ship bound for Canada, along with some of their zoo animals.  Then Martel downsizes the scope of the book further by eliminating most of the family and their animals at the beginning of Part Two by means of  an unexplained sinking of the cargo ship (\\"It made a monstrous metallic burp\\").<br />The next phase of the book (the bulk of it) takes place in a lifeboat.  It begins with a pared-down cast:a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, and Pi.   Thirty forgettable pages are devoted to chronicling in excruciating detail the movements of Pi and these other animals around the boat, with a few episodes of savagery thrown in to punctuate things.  Eventually, the zebra and orangutan are done in by the hyena, and then it is revealed that a Bengal Tiger named 'Robert Parker' has been lurking as a stowaway on the lifeboat (hiding unseen for three days, we are asked to believe).  The sudden appearance of Robert Parker is accompanied by some interesting attempts at simile:  - \\"Richard Parker's head... looked the size of the planet Jupiter\\"; \\"His paws were like volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica\\" (did someone mix up the envelopes for the Booker Prize and the Bulwer Lytton award?) .   In practical terms, it offers a pretext to get rid of the hyena, and we move into an extended endgame in which Pi and Robert Parker supposedly enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship (Pi catches food, gives most to Parker, Parker doesn't eat Pi). <br />Another hundred pages pass as Pi, Robert Parker, and the reader all slowly waste away.   The reader must skim in order to survive.  Finally, after a lacklustre hallucinatory experience involving an encounter with another survivor in another lifeboat, a brief moment of inspiration flares over the barren expanse of the novel.   The lifeboat makes it to a strange island of floating algae which has some fabulous qualities and is populated by swarms of meerkats (see: [...] for more on meerkats).    This section is reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's allegorical mini-fantasies - and surely the island is meant as an allegory of psychological transformation - but  where Vonnegut would take a page or two to deliver the goods, Martel uses up thirty.<br />\\"Life of Pi\\" concludes shortly after Pi and Robert Parker leave the island and arrive on the shores of Mexico where Robert Parker promptly vanishes into the jungle.  In the last scene, a pair of insurance adjustors have arrived to interrogate Pi, and when they express disbelief in his story of the events on the lifeboat, he offers them a second, shorter version of events which more or less parallels the first, but in which the animals on the lifeboat are replaced with people (Pi, his mother, a sailor, and a cook).  From an insurance claims perspective, the events on the lifeboat are of little concern anyhow, so the adjustors are free to choose whichever story they prefer.<br />Martel has been very open in interviews about how the freedom of to choose one story over the other works as a metaphor for the freedom to choose or to reject religion or other forms of faith.  If both stories 'fit' the meagre evidence available, why not make life more rewarding and opt for the more psychologically healthy version, even though it might not be the most plausible one?    <br />For the insurance adjustors, the choice isn't likely to make any long-term difference to their quality of life, but for Pi, matters are different.  Clearly, the shorter version of  events recounted at the end is the more plausible one, but it also involves the murder of Pi's mother and the murder of the cook by Pi himself.  It is understandable, therefore, that in Pi's subconscious mind the memory of such horrors would tend to be transformed into a version which was more psychologically palatable.  But since Pi is perfectly aware of both versions - and he himself knows which is the truth - the psychological efficacy of such a process is dubious.  As a mere lie, the animal story obviously has utility, but it is unconvincing as part of a process of psychological transformation.   The end result is that the `faith in the preferable fiction' theme falls flat, not because of problems inherent to this thesis, but because the novel does not provide a effective demonstration of the principle.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I was riveted. Watch this film...closely. Nuff' said.
068484267X|4.0|Mr. McCourt wrote a wonderful book about a very sad subject. His biography of his younger life shows how hard he had to try to obtain the life most of us were given and take for granted. The character development is spectacular. The story is sad, but is also triumphant as McCourt shows the loss of family members, the loss if his respect for other family members, and his struggle to save what little money he can for his journey back to America while trying to support his entire family on a meager income. <br />The story reads slow at times, but will retain a hold on your attention. I was shocked at how distant the writer made himself sound from the emotions he must have felt growing up.  I thought that there may have been an attempt to leave emotion out of the story, and that may have hurt my opinion of the novel a little but all in all, in my opinion it still remains a masterpiece.
0060523794|5.0|A previous reader review suggested that Mr. Gerstner's was out of touch and if readers want the real story they should read Soldier of Fortune 500. Who better than Mr. Gerstner, the man responsible for turning IBM around to write about it?  Who Say's Elephants Can Dance is wonderfully candid and well written (and by Mr. Gerstner himself, without the assistance of a ghost writer). I particularly liked the passages on \\"inspect versus expect,\\" managing by principles vs. process, focus on core competency and impact of culture and how to change it. These can be applied to any company.<br />I am author of Soldier of Fortune 500. In fact, my book is very positive about Mr. Gerstner and what he did for IBM. I think the Gerstner book is brilliant and would recommend it to all. Rather than contradicting, my book echoes similar themes, albeit the employee view vs. CEO.<br />Steve Romaine<BR>Author, Soldier of Fortune 500

B00006JKLI|5.0|I got the DVD-A of FRAGILE for Christmas, and it's probably the most amazing sounding thing that I've ever heard coming out of my home theatre system.  God bless DTS.  I have a Sony DVD video player, and the disc works fine.  I've been a fan of the origianl album for a long time, and I know it pretty much inside out.  This format allows you to hear so much more happening in the music, mainly because of the very high quality of the digital audio, but also because the sound field is so expanded over the 5 speakers.  It also has a very active LFE and the crossover is seamless.<br />The only complaint that I'd had about the original release in the past was about Rick Wakeman and Bill Bruford's solo pieces, however, on this version, they are a joy to listen to, simply because you get various sounds coming at you from every angle.<br />If all DVD-A discs are this good, this will truly be the format of the future.  I recommend this disc for all music fans.

0452281881|5.0|Beaumont has written an excellent book in the form of a collection of email messages from a dozen or more characters at a London ad agency.  From president down to accounting clerk everyone has a unique personality that comes through in the emailed missives.  He weaves a hilarious story out of the self serving, backstabbing, egocentric employees of the firm.<br />A quick read, I first finished it at a single sitting at a bookstore.  Then on a trip to London I picked it up at a bookstore and reread it on the flight back.
B00005JL2O|4.0|Mike Myers is a comic genius.  This movie lives on the experience of Austin Powers. His new character is great. If you like the other two movies then you will love this one.  Watch it with some other people and watch it more than once.  After a couple of times you will pick up on jokes.  Many people hated this movie because they never caught the jokes.  Mike Myers comedy is a mixture of Mel Brooks, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray.  His movies won't even make any top 100 AFI lists but they make you laugh. Now the DVD is great.  The picture is bright and clear.  The sound is also very good.  I am not fond of the Infinifilm DVD's but they are ok.

B00005JHAB|5.0|&quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; was immensely enjoyable... It had everything that is in a good movie, even comedy. In fact, I found some parts so funny I almost so funny my stomach hurt. <br />Here is the storyline--Mary {LOPEZ} is the number one wedding planner one can find. She busies herself organizing her plans and making couple's weddings the most enjoyable and beautiful days of the their lives. <br />Her life, as a wedding planner, would seem romantic, and filled with guys. However, it is quite the opposite. She is getting older and still has not found the right guy for her. While her dad is trying to set up a marriage with an annoying man she knew from her childhood, Mary meets the guy of her dreams {Mconughay} This man sweeps her off her feet (literally as he saves her life) and steals her heart at the movie theatre. <br />Mary is ecstatic and goes about her work beginning to plan a wedding for an extremely RICH and FAMOUS client of hers. However, when she meets the bride's groom she is quite surprised. It turns out to be the man she met and was...in love with. <br />From then on tensions flare as Mary almost gives up planning the wedding as she was in love with the groom. However she pulls through and manages to plan the wedding. <br />However, the day of the wedding, the groom and bride have second thoughts. The groom mainly because he is in love with Mary {lopez.}<br />In the end these two decide it would be best to get together.<br />I advise renting this movie and then ordering it if you like what you see.

B00005JLWL|5.0|Equilibrium is the biggest surprise of the year, an exhilarating action thriller with plot (albeit not a watertight one, but an interesting and intelligent one, nonetheless). The film is set sometime in the future, where society deems emotions illegal, and all citizens must take a daily dose of the sense-suppressing drug, Prozium.  To ensure the citizens take this drug, clerics are used to regulate the law with strict, brutal force. One such cleric, John Preston (Christian Bale), accidentally skips his daily dose and begins to experience emotions for the first time.  Ultimately, he chooses to join a rebel group to overthrow this society. <br />Those wondering just why they should see a movie they've never heard of; take my word for it, Equilibrium is the most exciting film of the year. Anyone who's seen this movie's half-dozen or so action sequences knows what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, be prepared to be blown away for an amazing two hour experience of suspense and thrills with a genuinely thought-provoking plot. <br />The suspenseful storyline (bearing many similarities to 1984 and Farenheit 451) creates an equal mixture of intrigue and fright, the mere thought of such a horrific future is terrifying, yet compelling.  Christian Bale's wonderful performance is among the year's best. The role requires him to experience emotions for the first time, and he pulls it off magnificently with scenes that range from touching (listening to that jazz piece) to absolutely hypnotic (his emotional breakdown in the middle of the streets). The other performances are solid, particularly Sean Bean in a small role as Bale's partner and Emily Watson as a \\"sense offender.\\"<br />Then there are the action sequences. I've never heard of director Kurt Wimmer before, but John Woo, Luc Besson, and the Wachowski brothers had better watch their back. In just his second film, Wimmer has surpassed anything those aforementioned filmmakers have accomplished.  The film displays a fighting style called gun-kata (the fighting method the clerics employ), a mixture of martial arts and guns, an ingenious set-up for the most creative action scenes I've seen in years. Equilibrium's climactic battle is among the best action sequences I've ever seen, a virtuoso display of mayhem that's brilliantly choreographed. <br />But as I lay acclaim to the film, I find it very disappointing barely anyone has seen this terrific movie. It's been buried in limited release and is now out of theaters entirely. I'd like to think Miramax/Dimension Films would go for a re-release, especially now that it's grown a devoted fan base, but that's wishful thinking, considering the fate of another recent Dimension Films release, Below. <br />DVD is now the only option to see the movie, and for those curious, I highly recommend you check this film out once it's out on video. I've heard that a release date is planned for May, no idea if it's true or not, but that wouldn't be too far from the release of The Matrix Reloaded, meaning it's entirely possible Equilibrium will only be further ignored. Let's hope this fantastic sci-fi/actioner gets the wide viewing it deserves.

B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets, in my opinion, Metallica's second best effort, Ride The Lightning being first. This is probably Metallica's heaviest album, and the final one with Cliff Burton. This was one of the 4 classic thrash albums of 1986, along with Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\", Megadeth's \\"Peace sells...But Who's Buying?\\" and \\"Among The Living\\" by Anthrax. I highy reccomend that you pick up those records too. Here is my review of each track:<br />1)Battery- The fastest song on the album along with \\"Damage Inc.\\" It starts out with an acoustic intro, and builds up into an extremley fast and heavy song. A generic thrash song, but good. 6/10<br />2)Master Of Puppets- An eight and a half minute epic about drug addiction. There is a slow melodic part in the middle, followed by an awesome solo by Hammet. One of the greatest Metallica songs of all-time. 10/10<br />3)The Thing That Should Not Be- They slow things down a bit on this one, but it is still pretty heavy. This one also has an acoustic intro. 9/10<br />4)Welcome Home (Sanitarium)- This is Metallica's second power ballad, even better than \\"Fade To Black\\" from \\"Ride The Lightning\\" It starts out very slow, and about halfway through the song it becomes a fast thrash song. Awesome. 10/10<br />5)Disposable Heroes- Another eight minute epic. This is thrash the whole way through, no melodic or soft parts, just straight up thrash. 10/10<br />6)Leper Messiah- Slow, heavy song that gets faster halfway through. Not one of my favorites, but still good. 8/10<br />7)Orion- An instrumental. My all-time favorite Metallica song. There are great solo's and the bass interlude by the late Cliff Burton is so damn good. I would buy this album just for this song. 11/10<br />8)Damage Inc.- Generic thrash, similar to \\"Battery.\\" Nothing special here, but still alright. 6/10<br />  In colclusion, this is an excellent metal album, and it should be in every metal fan's collection. If the only Metallica you have heard is from the awful \\"Black\\" album, pick this up, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B000002LCD|4.0|This is an excellent and very interesting soundtrack, and (no secret), essential for Madonna fans. It contains the two US hit singles WHO'S THAT GIRL and the still-irresistable CAUSING A COMMOTION as well as the #9 UK hit ballad THE LOOK OF LOVE and the also good CAN'T STOP. The songs from the other artists are as good as you will probably guess they are, but you may still get a kick out of them. Madonna fans will find themselves flipping to her material mostly, but songs like 24 HOURS and TURN IT UP are pretty good, even though no one knows where Club Nouveau and Michael Davidson are. They could be dead for all we know (of course, we hope not). One good thing about the movie was that it used Madonna's 4 songs very appropriately throughout the movie, they really do fit in with the plot, making this CD an authentic soundtrack to a very good movie. Anyone who saw and liked the movie needs to own this soundtrack, as well as any Madonna fan or lover of mediocre 80's pop.
B000062YAZ|5.0|\\"Reign In blood\\" is my favorite Slayer album. There is not one bad track on this whole record, each song is a keeper. Reign In Blood is the fastest record Slayer has ever done. You've got your insane solos, fast songs, incredible drumming courtesy of Dave Lombardo.Listen to the drum intro to \\"Epidemic.\\" It's awesome. Tom Araya has a perfect voice for this album. There are two bonus tracks on the remastered version: Agressive Perfector, and the remix of Criminally Insane. The best songs are: Raining Blood, Reborn, Postmortem, Angel of Death, hell all of the songs are great. Just buy this NOW.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Okay, usually I am not interested in actors trying to be rock stars.  For whatever reason, I just can't stand them.  But I bought a 'zine that came with a cd.  a 30STM song was on there (Capricorn) and I loved the song and video.. so I checked out some more songs.  I really fell in love with Oblivion and Buddha for Mary, as well as others.  So I got the cd.  Low and behold, Jared Leto (from movies such as Panic Room, Urban Legend, and a small part in Girl, Interrupted) is the lead singer.  Being obsessed with stars and space and whatnot, the \\"theme\\" of the cd really got my attention.  With lines like \\"under the burning sun, I take a look around, imagine if this all came down\\" (Oblivion) you have to love it.  Their sound reminds me of a more polished -for lack of a better term- Orgy (not the sex act lol, but the band for those that don't know of them.)  This is one actor that I can actually call a musician.

B000002UA9|3.0|And like all beginings, there are missteps and mistakes. Unlike other beginings, this would eventually remake and define musical history. At this point, showing more exhuberance and desire than talent, the boys recorded most of this disc in one day. That said, the disc starts off with a good cut in \\"I Saw Her Standing There.\\" You just can't get tired of this song. Truly a Beatles classic. \\"Misery\\" is next and supposedly it was written for Helen Shapiro on tour but the Beatles decided to use it. They should have have checked it at the door. Its a nothing song with absolutely nothing to recommend it. \\"Anna\\" shows Lennon in good voice, making this song better than it should be. \\"Chains,\\" is George's vehicle. It's a simple pop ditty in the vein of of \\"Misery,\\" although better than the former. \\"Boys\\" gives Ringo a chance to flex his pipes. His enthusastic drumming and singing make this song a success. \\"Ask Me Why\\" shows the writing of Lennon-McCartney to be more than just pop songwriters. The great vocalizing that would be a hallmark of their career is evident here. \\"Please, Please, Me\\" is another Bealtes classic--the rough, jangling guitars, the drums propelling the song, John's insistent vocal. It's fantastic. \\"Love Me Do,\\" however is not. Its almost a dirge. It's really not up to their standards. \\"P.S. I Love You\\" is better, especially the bridge which, once again,, hints at more amazing things to come. \\"Baby, It's You\\" is Lennon giving a lot to a song that doesn't deserve to be on here. It's ill-suited to the Beatles. The \\"sha-laa-laa\\" background vocals are more suited to 50's girl groups. \\"Do You Want To Know A Secret?\\" is another vehicle for George, but like his previous song, its really not much. \\"A Taste Of Honey\\" seems to be filler material which is sad since history would also show they had many other songs that could have been used on this debut disc instead of what was picked. \\"There's A Place\\" is a up tempo number of no real significance. Everything comes together for the boys on the last song, especially John's racous, rock'n roll vocal. \\"Twist And Shout\\" is the best track on the disc. Having 3 classic songs on your debut is certainly impressive, however the disc is marred by subpar song choices which fail to highlight the band's strengths.gether for the boys on the last song, especially John's racous, rock'n roll vocal. \\"Twist And Shout\\" is the best track on the disc.

0066214122|5.0|As much as I enjoyed it, this novel is not perfect. I feel that there are a few loose ends not explained at the end of the novel, although there is an attempt to wrap things up. In a good move Crichton provides a glimpse into what is to come with a few paragraphs at the start of the novel, but when you get to the actual text where the words should have been taken from, they don't match. These things aren't so bothersome to shun the book, the plot is worth the few discrepancies. It's also easy to imagine a sequel, if not in book form, but after it's made into a movie, as this will no doubt be done (the film rights were purchased right off). I'm not sure why that bothers me, but I guess I feel a little manipulated, but hopefully I'm wrong and that this was unintentional. I also think the title is misleading or at least unimaginative. All in all this is an Okay good read. I liked it. Other books I liked are Jeremy Leven's Satan:His Psychotherapy and Cure and Paul Omeziri's Descent into Illusions.
B00005Y228|5.0|Who would have thought Kylie Minogue would re-emmerge after a 13 year hiatus in the United States?  I was shocked when I found out it was Kylie Minogue singing \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\", the same girl who sang \\"The Locomotion\\"?  It's like whoa, what's up?.......Well,  I finally heard the whole album \\"Fever\\", and it's fantastic.  From a target audience standpoint and from what I've heard, it was marketed towards gay men 18-40, but \\"Fever\\" miraculously crossed over to find a wider audience, and it's great that everyone can enjoy it.  One of the most brilliant concepts of the album is they didn't put any slow ballads on it, which really keeps the energy flowing in a constant, consistant beat.  Here are my individual ratings for each song:<br />MORE MORE MORE: 5/5 <BR>fun, energetic, and disco tinged groove.<br />LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT: 4/5<BR>danceable, delectable, delicious<br />CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD: 4/5<BR>this really should be 3 stars, but when it first came out in the clubs it was 5 stars, but because we all have heard it a million times, it's 4 stars, make sense?<br />FEVER: 4/5<BR>poppy feel, very catchy lyrics, starts off bad but ends up hooking you.<br />GIVE IT TO ME: 2/5<BR>worst song on the album, very obnoxious beat, annoying song, i skip it.<br />FRAGILE: 5/5<BR>this song grows on you, it's very mystical and haunting, an emotional song that could make you cry.<br />COME INTO MY WORLD: 5/5<BR>this song is infectuous, the remixes are even better than the original album version.<br />IN YOUR EYES: 3/5<BR>just your everyday average song....<br />DANCEFLOOR: 4/5<BR>energetic groove that makes you want to hit the dancefloor.<br />LOVE AFFAIR: 4/5<BR>another good groove by Miss Kylie<br />YOUR LOVE: 4/5<BR>starts off bad, but ends up being a great song that makes you sing along.<br />BURNING UP: 4/5<BR>strange song with 2 different tempos, chorus sounds like a disco sample but it's Kylie, funky!
B00006CXXU|3.0|I loved Christina's first CD and waited anxiously for her next to be released.  She's extremely talented, but I have to admit that I was disappointed with this new one. The music industry called it &quot;gritty&quot;, I'd call it dark and depressing.  The lyrics are full of angst which I guess is the popular thing right now, the &quot;....I've struggled so much and been so mistreated&quot;  theme is something you hear a lot of these days in the music industry. I realize artists have to work very hard in this competitive industry but they all live very privileged lives and are fortunate enough to make millions of dollars doing something they love to do.  Let's hear something uplifting!
044022165X|5.0|\\"the Rainmaker\\" is an exciting tale of young rookie lawyer who's fresh to the business named Rudy Baylor. His first case is defending a couple who's son is dying of lukemia, and the Great Benefit Insurance Company refuses to help them...8 time in a row they deny their claim! Rudy furiously gets on the case. Meanwhile, he's trying to help a young lady get away from her abusive husband. In the complex court case that kind of reminds me the way Tom Clancy writes, Rudy takes the insurance company down in an exciting climax. This is an excellent young adult book and at times it seems you can't put it down. However, I think the language usage leaves something to be considered. Anyway, I give this book an A+.
B000006TRV|3.0|This is hardly a Pink Floyd album.<br />Though it's mainly a Roger Waters effort, that is not the reason The Wall is weak. (See Animals: mainly a Waters effort, but an amazing album.) This concept album is overbearing, overwrought, but with an under thought out plot. There's very little coherence, and nearly everyone who is familiar with the story of Pink's father and his decent into madness gleaned what they know from the movie or is intimately familiar with Roger Water's and Syd Barret's lives. With most songs merely vehicles for words, (Nobody Home, Goodbye, The Show Must Go On...etc...) some simply filler/horrendous (Empty Spaces, Bring the Boys Back Home, Waiting for the Worms), there is little space left for truly great music. This isn't to say there isn't any, however. The brooding Mother, the famous Another Brick in the Wall (parts 1,2,3, and Happiest Days of Our Lives), the hard rocking, truly fun arena rock parody Young Lust, the near perfect Hey You, and the absolutely amazing Comfortably Numb come to mind. (sporting the greatest guitar solo EVER. Period.) The songs In the Flesh and The Trial, while musically weak, are intriguing to listen to. What will strike Pink Floyd fans is the absolute lack of anything like Echoes, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Brain Damage/Eclipse, Dogs, or Pigs, let alone anything before Meddle. The songs sound like generic classic rock, not the emotional masterpieces present beforehand.<br />In any case, Water's monotone singing wears thin, no musical ideas are expanded or fully expressed, save Comfortably Numb. Sure, there's several truly amazing songs on here. The thing that makes it not as good as the other Floyd albums is that, previously, not only were several songs of their songs truly amazing, every one of their songs was truly amazing. Buy it if you like, you'll probably enjoy it. But there's many better options. <br />I'd recomend Wish You Were Here, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, and Animals over this. You should be ableto buy two for the exorbitant price of The Wall.
B000001Y79|4.0|When you are searching for music to listen to, you look for something that you like...that's different.  You don't want something like all the rest.  This album by No Doubt is surely something different from the usual.<br />Personally, I like songs where it sounds like the artist really \\"feels\\" what they are singing about.  Gwen Stefani puts a lot of emotion into her songs.  In the song \\"Don't Speak,\\" you can hear the pain she is singing of.  <br />Key songs on the album are \\"Spiderwebs,\\" \\"Just a Girl,\\" \\"Don't Speak,\\" and \\"Tragic Kingdom.\\"<BR>\\"Spiderwebs\\" is similar in subject to the more recent, \\"Bugaboo\\" by Destiny's Child.  It is about a girl who can't shake off a guy.  Unlike the song by Destiny's Child, the girl is more shy and can't stand up to the guy.  As they say: \\"I don't have the courage inside me to tell you please let me be.\\"<br />\\"Just a Girl\\" is one that definatly stands out.  It tells of where women stand in society..just because they are girls.  No Doubt adds a lot of humor to it to create an unforgettable single.  Quotes from the song that stand out are: \\"I'm just a girl all pretty and petite, so don't let me have any rights.  Oh, I've had it up to here!\\"  \\"I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be...guess I'm some kinda freak.\\"  \\"I'm just a girl in the world..that's all that you'll let me be!\\"  \\"I'm just a girl, my apologies, I'm just a girl, Lucky me!\\" <br />This CD is definatly a must-have!
B000065U1N|2.0|This is ultimately another Hollywood film whether or not the director intended it to be. It has little character development (if any) and doesn't really tell the story (beyond fighting which we already essentially knew). If you're looking for blood and guts alone, you're in for a ride. If you're looking for another Saving Private Ryan with character development and more than just fighting (with violence as a byproduct) then look elsewhere. <br />This is a very one-sided film. Corrupted politics (also existent in the 'good sided' US) somehow translates into purely evil somalians that do nothing but kill (innocents and american soldiers alike).<br />So, you will get to see the omnipotent americans kill those black hawk suckers alright (no pun intended...), but not much else. That's Hollywood for you.
B0000074GK|5.0|I was watching TV during the summer when I first heard Thunder. They were on a show, which depicted the very best of rock throughout the ages. It was there too that I discovered Whitesnake. Since, I've spent months in search of 'Here I Go Again' only to find (about half an hour ago) that I had it on CD the whole time and I've never once noticed!!!<BR>Well, that's quite a different story. I'm Thunder's latest fan. Their definitive style and classy edge give rock 'n' roll something to admire. NEVER BEFORE has my breath been taken away by a song so dramatically as when I heard 'Love Walked In' for the first time. If there's a rock song out there that's better than this then I don't have a clue what it would be or where it could be found. It was a stroke of luck that a friend of mine found I'd heard Thunder. She gave me this CD to borrow, so now I'm looking to buy it. It's fantastic throughout. 'She's So Fine', 'Until My Dying Day' and 'Love Walked In' are three sensational tracks... so I'd recommend this CD to anyone and everyone who loves the sound of that sweet guitar! Rock on!
B000068TPN|2.0|This is a movie with excellent potential, yet it doesn't quite 'hit'. For one thing, Mel Gibson's war general accent seems totally fake. Especially given the way his character is portrayed. Character development, although attempted, turns out to be weak. Perhaps this is related to the fact that the fighting dominates the movie. In fact, the fighting sequences are the one part of this film that's great. Obviously director Randall Wallace wanted to show the non-stop killing and unrest, but he does so at the expense of the rest of the story. Also, the subplot of the wives back at home is interesting but poorly placed. Wallace jumps from brutal killing to the peaceful wives in a way that seems obscure and awkward.<br />Perhaps I was hoping too much for another Saving Private Ryan or the like but instead its more of a detached experience of explicit brutality. Worth a watch; not the buy.

B00004UEE5|5.0|Although this performance lacks the passionate quality that some others bring to this work, noticably Bernstein, it is a sensitive and observant one which, unlike the well known 1970 recording of Barenboim's predecessor in Chicago (i.e. Solti), is not marred by being overdriven in places. Nevertheless, the orchestral playing retains the blend of power and precision characteristic of this orchestra in this repertoire, particularly in the brass. Furthermore, the sound is excellent. If one is willing to pay the premium to have this work on DVD, this is definitely worth acquiring.
6304044836|4.0|I'll spare the details of the plot since it's quite clear already.  Frankly, I found nothing extrodinary about the acting done by Julia Ormond.  She looks the same, acts the same, and I see no change in the Sabrina character.  I think the only attractions to this version are  Harrison Ford, who does an excellent job as the older brother, and Greg Kinnear, who plays the younger brother.  However, I am doing a 'comparison' which is very unfair because the older cast of the original had that 'classic' touch of the time and Audrey Hepburn plays all her parts with a believable and natural grace that is hard to come by in today's actors.  I really felt like giving this movie only 3 stars, but it was only because of Acting reasons that I had qualms with  I decided to give it 4 stars instead because it would be somewhat biased of me since I am a Drama Student so I look at these things more closely than the usual viewer.  If you haven't seen the original, then this is a good movie to watch, but if you are like me and watch acting closely...this might leave you with a twitch.
B00002EPMF|5.0|This is Chuck's masterpiece. It's just amazing how complex this album is, I still cannot believe that a human beign could made something like this. Amazing drums by Richard Christy, awesome alternance of solos between Schuldiner and Hamm, and an unexpected vocal work of Tim Aymar. And of course another bass  lesson offered by Steve DiGiorgio. It's just impossible to include it in any style, it's just Metal. Fot the ones familiar with the Death sound, this is the Chuck's last lesson for those who criticized him during the years...Is not an extrem Metal album, because Death was never an extrem Metal band.. Something links togheter all his amazing works, songs like Mutilation, Pull the Plug, Low Life, Cosmic Sea, The Philosopher, Zero Tolerance, Vioce of the Soul, Consumed, are so different by eachother, but in the same time so alike, is something that nobody in this field could create so far... This is just music, made for those who really can feel it, who really believe in it..
B00000253N|5.0|To quote Loudon Wainwright in his &quot;talking new Bob Dylan&quot; song; the 'ringing' of Dylan's melodic inventiveness and poetic genius did indeed get 'truer' with this phenominal album. I am also only sixteen, but the beauty and grace of &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; is as evident to me as it must have been to those hearing it on its release in 1975. This is Dylan taking a giant step outside the box; reflecting on his failed relationships as well as his status as 'poster boy'/'Judas' of the new folk movement. There is an anger and bitterness here, but also an underlying sense of stoicsism and resilliance, from the understated majesty of &quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot;; to the grand, sweeping excellence of &quot; Tangled up in Blue&quot;; to the album's most under-rated masterpiece: &quot;Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of hearts&quot;. Everyone should own this album.

0151008116|5.0|I don't generally read books of this genre.  Most of my reading consists of biography, history, science, and some escapist fiction.  I read this book after it was strongly recommended to me, and I found it amazingly powerful literature.  <br />It did not change my life, nor did it reveal new truths to me.  What it did do was rise to the level of the best storytelling.<br />This is a tale of struggle as personal and compelling as any great shipwreck story (the various tales of the Essex come to mind). Every step into the fantastic is revealed to be prosaic a moment later, and thereby the author takes you three steps into imagination and two steps back, so that without realizing it you find yourself slowly moving into a world out of sync.  <br />At the end the author offers you a clear choice, and no matter how strongly you feel about the outcome (I have my opinion), you can find people who intelligently and passionately conclude the opposite.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the out-of-phase feel of books like Winter's Tale (Helprin), and to anyone fascinated by survival at sea.  A rare overlap, but there you have it.
630179513X|4.0|A very good movie, but the part where doc. made a time machine out of a train at the end was terrible, a bad ending to a very good movie, but the worst of the 3. TWO IS THE BEST
B00007E8V4|5.0|This CD rocks, i love system of a down's different style of music. i have been a fan ever since i picked up a copy of toxicity because a friend told me it was a good buy. after listing to the first song i thought to myself &quot;what the f*&amp;k&quot; i thought it was the strangest thing i have ever heard. that is what makes this band soooooo good. if you are not a soad fan and you buy this cd. listen with an open mind. you have never heard anything like this before
B000068TPN|5.0|This is essentially a Vietnam War prequel. Most Vietnam War movies cover many time periods well after the war started. This is at the very early days of the war.<br />Mel Gibson is very good in this role. I had in my mind the \\"pretty boy\\" from some of his other movies and had doubts that he could be a soldier. He pulled it off and did an excellent job. Smart, brave and handsome without the baggage that typically goes with that.<br />Perhaps not as accurate as \\"Black Hawk Down\\" nor as emotional as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". Still, much better than 80% of the Vietnam War movies and better than many other war movies, excepting \\"Black Hawk Down\\", which may be my favorite. Good stuff.
B00006JIAF|5.0|The Strokes are the essence of cool.  People love to hate on them because of all the hype but they are without a doubt the band of the year in my book (and in many more qualified critics opinoins as well).
0440214041|3.0|... watch the movie instead.<br />This book revolves around law student Darby Shaw and the brief she wrote which turns out to explain precisely why two Supreme Court justices were murdered.  Once the brief has been read by the wrong (right?) people, she then must run for her life, helped by Washington Post reporter Gray Grantham.<br />If you like reading John Grisham novels, you'll most likely enjoy this book. His style is very well established, and you can almost feel like you are reading a movie script due to the pace he injects into his stories.  But personally, this is a case where the movie seemed to me more compelling than the book.<br />A decent book, a better movie.
B00005QIPH|5.0|One of the best things to happen to music in a long time.  Its incredibly unfair how people allow the hype to affect there voting.  They didnt ask for the hype, they were given it  because they deserved it.  If there werent any other  'The'  bands out there (which the Strokes are unfairly compared to by brainless TRL watchers even though they dont sound anything like the other  'The'  bands and make different kinds of music) than the Strokes would be getting the respect they deserve.<BR>Standout Tracks;  Hard to Explain, Barely Legal, Last Nite, The Modern Age
0440234743|2.0|...finally Grisham writes a novel that is based outside the southern USA, in this case Washington and Brasil. <br />The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, I found that there was a lack of tension in this story right through to to ending. <br />The story has some interesting elements to it, but I found it overall disappointing in the end.
0553277472|3.0|This is the kind of book that a person who is intelligent but uneducated in philosophy would pick up, read, and be excited and terribly enlightened by.  This apparently was the state of many of the &quot;hippies&quot; who read this book when it came out.  But for someone who has read Aristotle and Plato and the myriad of others, especially the Greeks, this book can seem almost ridiculously off-center in its generalizations.  Whether it is or not, that is for the reader to decide, I suppose.<br />The narrator is at first likeable, but as the book moves on and his madness becomes evident, you see his character become despicable, self-absorbed, mean, closed-minded, and, well, a hypocrite in a number of ways.  This change may be a large part of the appeal of this book as a sort of psychological novel, though I am still not sure whether that is what Pirsig intended it to be.<br />Despite the disgust and boredom I sometimes felt while reading, the book has a lot of good things to say about living and the self.  Most importantly, if you pay enough attention it will definitely get you thinking.  Overall, a controversial book, but worth reading if only for the thought and controversy it will provoke within your own mind.
0385721234|5.0|... a fantastic movie.<br />I saw the movie when it first came out, and have just read the book.<br />However much I enjoyed the film, I must say that reading this story is even more enjoyable than watching it on screen.  You feel for the main character in this book, Tita, and you can almost smell her emotion-infused recipes as you read about their preparation.<br />I strongly recommend this book.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I (not the typical teenager) hated this movie - its true it has some good points but the majority of it was either unrealistic or just pointless. when i saw this movie in the theater i saw nothing but people with little rice burners think that its cool because it had their import car scene with some hot girls. this is a complete load of ****. and from a standpoint of realism there is no way a little toyota supra can keep up with a blown 1970 Charger (yes it was a 1970 becuase i guess im the only one who knows my cars) unrealistic again was the race scene near the beginning - that never happens here in LA.  the only good thing i can think of this movie is the cars - but to compare them the way they did is horrible - i feel that a better theme would have been domestic muscle cars against the thriving import cars - the way it is in real life ----  to compare the two would prove the muscle cars would be dominant...  (my POV is bias becuase i own a 1968 dodge charger) but...   i havent been beeten by a honda yet :)
B00006ZSAD|5.0|This collaboration between Beth Gibbons of Portishead and Rustin' Man (aka Paul Webb, erstwhile bassist of Talk Talk) is without doubt one of the best discs of the year.  At times it sounds like &quot;Portishead Unplugged,&quot; while at others Beth seems to be chanelling the ghost of Sandy Denny or Nick Drake. &quot;P&quot; fans may be disappointed by the relative lack of electronica here, although the tunes themselves are for the most part very similar in construction/arrangement to those of Portishead.  The other members of that band show up here and there on the disc, and it was great to see that some of the old Talk Talk stalwarts, like Lee Harris and Mark Feltham, are on here too.<br />This is probably not the type of record that will blow you away on first listen. It's a grower.  But once the bug's got you it's incredibly addicting.  Major kudos to Beth and Paul.<br />P.S.  If you dig this kind of thing, you definitely need to check out the final two albums by Paul's old band, Talk Talk. SPIRIT OF EDEN and LAUGHING STOCK were a marked departure from the band's earlier (and excellent) efforts at adventurous, melodic synth pop-rock.  These two records groove in a way that not much else was grooving in the late 80's, and definitely paved the way for some of the more &quot;experimental&quot; pop of the 90's, Portishead included.  When these two records came out nothing else sounded like them (what? no singles? no songs under 5 minutes?) and they're still very timeless sounding.  If they were released tomorrow, they'd still be current.
B000069AUI|5.0|I knew very little about Coldplay when I got this CD, and I was apprehensive about putting it in the CD player, afraid it would be another trashy modern band. But after listening to the first few songs, I found it to be an incredible melodic fusion of pop and new age music. Coldplay uses everything from soft pianos and keyboards, to awesome guitar interludes, and even orchestral strings (as well as Chris Martin's hauntingly good voice.)<BR>This is one of the few CD's where I don't skip any tracks, and in fact, I've had the thing on repeat for about 14 hours now. If you're into any modern music or pop or anything, you will love this CD.
6300263673|5.0|One reviewer put down this movie because of its \\"relative morality\\".  The thing is, Baby wasn't underage (I think the reviewer said she was 16).  Her dad says that she is going off to college in the fall, so you should assume that she is 18.  Anyway, while the music and dancing are fun, that is not what this movie is about to me.  Its about Baby's coming of age.  There are a lot of deep interactions between people here.
0312965788|5.0|James Herriot was a country veterinarion who lived in Yorkshire before (and after) World War II. His stories are funny, heartwarming, sad, and highly educational. And after reading this, you will either want to be a vet or be very grateful that you aren't one.<br />The book opens (after a brief chapter taking place several months later) with James arriving in Yorkshire, to be the assistant to the eccentric but kindly Siegfried Farnon (yes, that is his name).  He becomes accustomed to Siegfried, Siegfried's mischievous younger brother Tristan (yes, that is his name), and the gruff, kindly farmers who eke out a living in the Yorkshire Dales. Pampered pooches who are spoiled rotten, savage pigs who chase Tristan around the farm, a nightmarishly strict secretary who drives Siegfried up the wall, James's car-with-no-brakes, cows running on three cylinders, a sadistic vet who makes James wear a rubber bodysuit, and an elderly, immensely wealthy widow who adopts a pig. And through this, James falls in love with the beautiful Helen Alderson and worms his way into the trust of the farmers.<br />James Herriot (real name, James Wight) was truly a one-of-a-kind man. He let readers into his head throughout the book, where the cows kick him across the yard, farmers often treat him as an interloper or a nuisance, and his boss gives contradicting orders from one day to the next. But he never loses his drive or his love of animals. (Okay, he hates some animals, but only as individuals) He even lets the readers see him at his worst, when he's humiliated by some recalcitrant livestock, and one horrible scene where he and his date show up drunk and mud-smeared in front of the girl he adores. (Not to mention when Tristan got him to use very feminine-smelling bath salts) But don't think that all of these stories are funny or romantic -- quite a few are aggravating or outright sad. James didn't soften the blows at all.<br />The people around James are just as fantastic: Siegfried, his weird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her). There are a lot of details about surgery and stuff like that that will gross out the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia. (For example, what is a torsion?)<br />It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic, dramatic. \\"All Creatures Great And Small\\" (and its four sequels) is a fantastic read for all ages.eird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her).

B000075BFK|5.0|as a longtime fan of 2pac (close to a decade), i have to admit that this album is the best album released after his death. about half the songs have the original beats and the otha half was remixed by contemporary producers, and i thought giving it a more today's kind of sound. good variety of lyrical content (ghetto blues songs, hittin up hoez songs, ride on my foes songs, etc. lol) definately pick up this album, if u a new or old pac fan.
B000002MUN|5.0|This is one of the greatest rock and roll records of the nineties, hands down. Tom Petty has created an album that can be listened to in any mood your in, (sad,happy,depressed,partying) whatever. its awesome. there is not a bad song on here, from the acoustic(wildflowers) to the all out rocking (you wreck me), its all good. if you are in need of a solid rock album and have not yet heard tom petty, this is the album to get. also, &quot;you dont know how it feels&quot; is in my opinion one of the greatest smoking anthems of all time.
0807282375|5.0|One of the best, if not the best, books I have ever read. And I've read a lot. It seems to be simple story of a boy and a girl, and essentially it is. But there's love and death and all the things that matter in life. This book completely toppled down everything I had previously believed in and then showed me a belief so much better, so much more beautiful that I laughed at the squalor my mind used to inhabit. The characters seem more than real; they are real. They live and breathe and laugh and love with you, as you, because of you. The most brilliant thing I've ever had the pleasure to read. Applause for Phillip Pullman.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is a unique combination of Rage guitar riffs and Soundgarden lyrics and voice.  Those looking for either a Rage or Soundgarden sound will be disappointed.  All the songs are heavy guitar-driven tunes with depressing lyrics (all written by Chris Cornell).<br />With the other boy-rock bands out there (linkin park, matchbox twenty), this is a refreshing alternative.  The music is nothing innovative or mysterious - straightforward rock is what I say!

Every album just gets better and better. You can hear just how much they've evolved as song writters and musicians as well as artist in the visual aspects of there cd packaging. Songs flow in and out of time signatures like an orchestra. From the tribal drum pounding of &quot;The Grundge&quot; to the triplets of &quot;Schism&quot;, Tool's constantly evolving forcing you to think for yourself. Submerge yourself in Tool's music and awake into a new level of consciousness.
0064471047|5.0|Although this was the first Narnia book published, it is the second in the series. It is about four siblings who get sent to a big house in the country during the war. Their names are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This house was owned by an old professer. One day they were playing hide-and-seek and Lucy decides to hide in a wardrobe. She finds that the wardrobe has no back. She walks through and finds herself in the land of Narnia where it is always Winter and never Christmas. She befriends a fawn an he tells her that Narnia was taken over by the White Witch Jadis, and that it is she who turned Narnia into winter. It is she who turns those who do not follow her into stone. The White Witch is completely evil. Lucy finds her way back and tells her siblings. They don't believe her but soon all four find themselves in Narnia, waging a war against the White Witch with Aslan the Lion by their side.<br />As is true for all the Narnia books, this book is straight-forward with excellent characters and plot. It is a quick read, but you will want to read it over and over again. With all the hype of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings nowadays, Narnia should become more popular spawning live-action movies and plastic lunch boxes. We'll just have to wait and see.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Not since ALL THAT JAZZ (1979) have I seen a film musical with as much raw energy as CHICAGO. This is fitting since the former is about the life of the brilliant director-choreographer-composer Bob Fosse, and the latter is an adaptation from his stage musical of the same name. As a matter of fact, the opening number in CHICAGO is \\"All That Jazz\\".<br />CHICAGO has, of course, enough of a rudimentary plot to cement together the dance numbers, which are the film's raison d'être. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a wannabe dancer in 1930s Chicago, who idolizes Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). However, both are arrested for murder, Roxie having gunned down a duplicitous lover after he reneges on a promise to introduce her to a friend who can get her into the Biz, and Velma for having whacked her husband and her sister when she caught the two in bed together. Thrown into Cook County Jail, both fall under the control of the jolly and corrupt Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton (Queen Latifah), and both retain the services of Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a flamboyant lawyer who specializes in defending women accused of homicide, and who's never lost a case.<br />There aren't enough superlatives to describe CHICAGO, and I fear my review won't do it justice.  Jones, a former dancer before she turned actress, struts her magnificent stuff beginning with the opening number (\\"All That Jazz\\"). Zellweger and Gere, neither hoofers by training, are seemingly miscast - but it works magnificently. All three sing and dance their way through the film in visually stunning choreographed numbers that had the audience clapping after each.<br />As Roxie and Velma worked their way through the criminal and judicial systems, the creators of CHICAGO were astoundingly clever in superimposing a musical version of each step in the process on the \\"real\\" one, for examples, the on-site police investigation of Roxie's crime (\\"Funny Honey\\"), Matron Morton's introductory speech to her new charges (\\"When You're Good to Mama\\"),  Flynn's entrance (\\"All I Care About\\"), and Roxie's defense (\\"We Both Reached for the Gun\\"). My favorite comes during Roxie's trial when Flynn, more showman than counselor, displays his philosophy on defense strategy with the glitzy \\"Razzle Dazzle\\".<br />CHICAGO is loud, colorful, in-your-face, exuberant entertainment. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. And if you don't take the opportunity to see it while it's on the Big Screen at the beginning of 2003, then you're doing yourself a huge injustice. I beg you to see this film!

B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers (TTT) is an absolutely astounding chapter in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  In many ways it exceeds its predecessor, the Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR), and in some ways it doesn't succeed as well.  In any case, there is no denying that it is another masterpiece of cinema that is setting a new standard for the action/adventure and fantasy genres, as well as setting a new example of quality and dedication for all movies in the future.<br />The story of TTT was already recognized as a work of literary magnificence and incomparable imagination when it was published in book form decades ago, and that story has lost practically none of its potency in Peter Jackson's adaptation.  The themes of good versus evil and hope versus despair are as strong as ever, and they shine in this movie.  The director's cinematic brilliance really comes to bear when he actually improves upon the book's fairly weak characterization, and his masterful knowledge of storytelling is obvious with many of the things he changed from the book.  Instead of bringing down the movie, many of the changes enhance its cinematic power, and Peter Jackson knows this.<br />Unlike FOTR, however, some of the more major changes did seem to degrade the story rather than enhance it.  The Arwen/Aragorn relationship is something that needed to be played on more, but the writers went too far and ended up beating it into the ground.  The addition of Frodo and company taking a trip to Osgiliath served almost no purpose and visibly threw off the flow of the story.  However, even these low points of the movie are handled excellently and are easily forgiven.<br />The acting continued with the same expertise as FOTR.  Elijah Wood handles Frodo's continued decent under the Ring's power with expertise, and performs equally well during those brief reprises of the old Frodo of the Shire.  Sean Astin's acting is just as good if not better than in the previous movie.  Viggo Mortensen continues to shine as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom is finally given some real screen time and manges to show us that he's really good at being an Elf, and John Rhys-Davies is brilliant as the gruff, gentle, warrior-comedian Dwarf Gimli.  Miranda Otto (Eowyn) works her magic wonderfully ninety-percent of the time, only giving a slightly manufactured scene once.  Her part in the Return of the King (ROTK) will be handled expertly if she showed us anything in this movie.  Bernard Hill, much like Miranda, shows his skill wonderfully in this movie, though his grief at his fallen son felt contrived rather than sincere.  But, to quote many other viewers, Gollum stole the show.  Andy Serkis was set to the task of playing one of the deepest and most tortured characters ever written and he performs it beautifully.  If only the Academy could see past the pixels, they might find Best Supporting Actor material.<br />The action in TTT is one aspect of the movie that will undoubtedly set a new standard for cinematic battles in the coming years.  Never before has an army looked so awe-inspiring, never has a battle of such immense proportions ever been attempted, and not once has it worked so well in such an epic way.  Although FOTR's battles were more enjoyable for their small-scale, personal involvement with the characters, TTT's battles take the gargantuan, impersonal battles of war to a new level that will not disappoint.  However, one personal battle in TTT does exceed all others; the battle of Gandalf versus the Balrog might be the most exhilarating battle ever put to film.  The only downfall of any of the battles was a very obvious lack of realism during some parts that pulled the audience out of the movie at times, but it does not ruin the movie by any means.<br />Howard Shore's score may not be as powerful as FOTR's all the time, but it definitely equals it in many parts and works extremely well as a second act.  The Rohan theme was extremely emotional, and, barring any surprise pieces of brilliance, Gollum's Song deserves the Oscar for Best Song this year.<br />The special effects of TTT are the best of any movie yet.  Gollum is, without a doubt, the most believable CG-created character ever, almost matching Andy Serkis's believability.  Many reviews have claimed that some of the CG shots of the Ents and Wargs were obviously CG, which is true, but they leave out the fact that the worst CG in TTT is better than most movies accomplish at their best.  The computer-generated armies at Helm's Deep will change movie making, which is enough said about that.<br />The biggest disappointment of TTT was the editing.  It simply felt rushed in parts, and there were times when the cutting was obvious.  The Extended Edition of TTT should fix this, but it was disappointing to see that TTT had to be hacked with a hatchet to fit within the three-hour time limit.<br />The minor faults of TTT cannot compare to the grand vision that is the Lord of the Rings.  Peter Jackson has done an excellent job of not only translating the book onto the movie screen, but he has made a movie that even non-Tolkien fans can enjoy supremely.  What's even more exciting is the prospect that the whole of these movies will be greater than the sum of its parts.  ROTK is going to complete one of the greatest achievements in film history, and it's almost painful to think of the one-year wait we have until we can finally see this great work complete.iance, Gollum's Song deserves the Oscar for Best Song this year.  <br />The special effects of TTT are the best of any movie yet.

B00004WGAI|3.0|JANE EYRE is the latest in a series of film adaptations of 19th century novels by female English authors that I've been encouraged to view by female acquaintances curious as to my reaction to such genteel fare. While I've thoroughly enjoyed the screen versions of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and MANSFIELD PARK, Charlotte Bronte's JE, I'm afraid, draws a line in the sand that I cannot cross.<br />This 1983 cinematic release of JE is, as I understand it, a faithful rendering of the original written work - a claim I have no desire to verify by reading the latter. In any case, Jane (Zelah Clarke) is an orphan, raised initially by an unloving benefactress and then in a school for girls, who at 18 comes to live at Thornfield Hall, the great house of Mr. Rochester (Timothy Dalton), where Jane is employed as governess to Rochester's illegitimate daughter. Both Jane and Rochester are extremely lonely individuals, and the course of their subsequent emotional relationship is overwrought and melodramatic to an extreme. The \\"thorn\\" in Thornfield is apt, especially as it relates to the dark secret which Rochester hides in a garret room.<br />One cannot fault the quality of the production or the acting, and I'll allow three stars in recognition. Clarke is superb as the somber but independent Jane whose emotions are continuously buffeted. Dalton is perfect as the darkly handsome and brooding Rochester. The costuming seems impeccable (though I'm in no expert position to judge). And the locations of the shoot, while gloomy, are at least in England, a green and otherwise pleasant land that is my spiritual home.<br />I loved Austen's P&P, S&S and MP for the wry and sometimes mischievous humor demonstrated by those stories' respective heroines. JANE EYRE lacks any humor whatsoever. It's unrelentingly dark, gloomy and depressing. Even the scene where Jane has her fortune told by the gypsy woman is not so much a crack in the dark tenor of the storyline as another one of Rochester's manic mood swings. One wishes Rochester would just snap out of it.<br />My opinion of JE is liable to be roundly excoriated by Bronte fans. That's fine. I still wouldn't recommend it unless one is seeking to come down precipitously from an emotional high. And with a run time 1 minute short of 4 hours, the agony seems endless.one of Rochester's manic mood swings.

0694003611|5.0|My daughter loves this book!  She is only 10 mos old now, but points out the \\"red balloon\\" to me when we read it before bedtime.  There are so many things to talk about on the pages as you read the story.  I like to play \\"where is the little mouse\\" because he is in a different spot on each page.<br />I have 2 of these books: one with the tape and the larger book, and the other one is smaller, and harder.  I think by the time my daughter can talk she will know this book by heart.  It's one of her favorites!<br />Enjoy!
B00005JL78|4.0|Skip the prior pompous negative review and see this film.
1567184855|4.0|Well written book with an enthralling topic and pace, but not enough to pin all your hopes to this basket of eggs.<br />There is no back up in a scientific sense about his methods used.  No other master hypnotist there to witness or back up his claims and interpretations of the sessions.  All we have are his assertions that he alone has been able to break this untapped barrier and his claims that his personal viewpoints have not been fed into the subjects or his interpretations of the events they told.<br />I'm afraid anyone could make any such claim and put any angle on it to sell a book.  The fact is, this book lacks any proof that such sessions did in deed happen, that it was done in a professional manner if it happened, and if said sessions happened there is no proof that his point of view has remained out of the interpretation of events.
6305718954|5.0|This movie is probably the most thought provoking movie I have seen in quite while. In this movie, we have a completely hedonistic, nihilistic Patricia Arquette who denies God, while  Gabriel Byrne plays a scientist/priest who questions miracles and on some level questions his faith through his church, yet believes in God. <br />The cast does an outstanding job, and there are some excellent religious points made in the movie. Gabriel Byrne has a brief speech where he explains how science and the &quot;just happened&quot; theory in regards to life appearing on this planet has contradictions. Then, in another scene, an ex-priest talks of what and where the true church is to be found. Which, by the way, is very much correct, according to the Gospels.<br />The ending very much follows the religious theme of the movie and draws heavily from stories in the Bible where both doubters and unbelievers were given signs that convinces them of the existence of God.<br />I rate it worth owning, because the movie is worth seeing more than once. Again, another movie that had lousy reviews, and once again, the reviews were wrong.
B00003CXB2|5.0|&quot;Lawrence Of Arabia&quot; is easily one of the best movies ever made. It's my favorite David Lean picture. The movie is based on a true story about T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole, Oscar-nominated), a British officer, who wanted to get a job as an observer with Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), the leader of the Arab army. Lawrence led the Arabs against the Turks during World War I from 1915-18. The movie is so damn long, but I saw all parts of it and it was great. &quot;Lawrence Of Arabia&quot; is the winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director (David Lean). I have this movie on the Limited Edition 2-Disc DVD and I am happy to own it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is outstanding.  Russell Crowe, the Gladiator, examplifies that moral principles must never been abandoned nor compromised.  The message of living for and following one's moral convitions by taking an honorable course of action is played out with phenominal courage. This movie is not for the faint hearted, however, it gives us a reconviction to stand up for what is morally correct and of value in life.   Excellent!
B00003CX97|5.0|&quot;The Bridge On The River Kwai&quot; is one of the best movies ever made. It's my second favorite David Lean picture. The movie deals with the British soldiers who were forced, by Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa, Oscar-nominated) and Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness, Oscar-winner), to build a railway bridge in the jungle for the trains to cross, but Major Shears (William Holden) and other allied men were here to destroy it. The movie is the winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director (David Lean). I have this movie on the Limited Edition 2-Disc DVD and I highly recommend it.
B000002NJM|5.0|this is a great cd! it's the bizzy-bizzy bomb! you have some classics on there like the delfonics and my girl--minnie riperton! see sings \\"inside my love\\" whew! that  songs makes me think about my love!! buy this cd! i saw the movie and i heard all of this poppin' music--i had to get this!! even my girl pam grier miss jackie herself hums a tune! cool, cool cool! i also reccomend pulp fiction's audio!
B00006IR5S|5.0|Harry Potter and The Chamber Of Secrets is an excellent soundtrack.  The music is fast - paced.  My favorites are Prologue: Book 2 and Escape From the Dursleys, The Flying Car, and The Reunion Of Friends.  I could listen to this entire soundtrack without getting bored or tired of it.  John Williams is excellent!  I'd recommend this.
B00005RFAI|3.0|P!nk's new album opens up with first single \\"Get the party started\\" an obvious party anthem. The first time I heard it I thought it was a Robbie Williams song. It later grew on me, though I never got to love it.<BR>   Everything seemed to change thanks to follow-up \\"Don't let me get me\\" a rockier tune with an awesome video which I instantly liked.<BR>   The first time I gave the entire album a listen I was disappointed, since there were not many memorable moments and the r&b and hip-hop I was hoping for was definitely missing.<BR>   \\"18 wheeler\\" is a very good song, but I hate the fact that she does not say the word \\"...\\"  (...\\"you can run over me with an 18 wheeler track, and I won't give a  ...\\"...)<BR>This is an obvious strategy to apply to wider audiences and sell more records. <BR>   The track I liked the most was \\"Family portrait\\". She sings and you can actually feel she's hurt from what the lyrics say.<BR>   Unluckily there are a few songs which are just not great, though they are ok. ( \\"Lonely girl\\" feat. Linda Perry ; \\"Missundaztood\\" ; \\"Dear diary\\" ).<BR>   Having Linda Perry as a collaborator in most of the album gives P!nk a rockier edge she has never displayed before, though it takes her away from the r&b she felt so comfortable with.<BR>   \\"Misery\\" is a standout track, specially if you like how Steven Tyler sings, because if not the song may turn a bit annoying for the way the sing it.<BR>   P!nk has shown she can make a decent album even having moved on from what she used to do. She has a powerful voice which at times may sound a bit out of place, well, at least till we become familiar  listening to this new P!nk.
B00006RCNW|5.0|When they say The Shield is groundbreaking, the critics are talking about more than the amped-up sex-and-violence.  This show relentlessly explores topics that no one else will touch:  police brutality and its sometimes positive result, racial politics, political correctness, and more.  Thanks to first-rate writing, there areno easy answers, and just when you think you know a character, that character is confronted with a different set of rules, and reacts completely unpredictably.  In our post-9/11 search for comfort, this is not easy material to love, but every actor on screen lives these  characters from the inside out.  Special praise to the 8 principal actors and those who play recurring characters for keeping it real week in and week out.  Chiklis got an Emmy out of this.  Look for CCH Pounder, Benito Martinez, Jay Karnes and Michael Jace to score next time around.  Their portrayals are courageous and original!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Someone I know told me once &quot;You don't know what it's like to be free because you served in the Military.&quot;<br />What she needs to do is see this series. And see what the people who fought World War Two went through, to give her the FREEDOM to even say such offensive words to me. <br />Band of Brothers is the best attempt yet at showing the brutality of combat, it's effects on the people fighting it, <BR>and the drama that surrounds it. It's quite a change from the ridiculous Ramboesque movies that Hollywood created not too long ago.<br />It's VERY well done. The acting is top notch, the effects are excellent, the stories are cleverly done and directed. The only sore points were the DVD's themselves, which have a good amount of additional information, but it seems haphazardly done in order to finish the DVDs on time. <br />I must admit I shed a few tears towards the end. To that person who said the above words to me, I reccommend that she sees this series, and realizes that if it wasn't for the boys of Easy Company and the millions of others who fought in America's wars, she would never have the freedom to even think of saying it. <br />A former US Paratrooper
B00005JLRR|1.0|So it's come down to this: 20 minutes of substantive material lost in a sea of fight scenes, battle scenes, and noisy special effects.  If you've always wanted Star Trek to be more like an expensive Saturday morning cartoon (\\"The action is non-stop!\\"), congratulations; this one's for you.  If you have previously admired the interesting characters and thoughtful science fiction that used to be hallmarks of the series, avoid this vacuous turkey.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I love the cd it a combination of return of satern and tragic kingdom... it has dosens of hits and it is a great cd to listen to all the way threw!
B000001E7T|5.0|This is a seriously outstanding album. It is easily one of the greatest pieces of music recorded in the last 20 years. Buy it and you will not be disappointed.<br />To Bring You My Love is a collection of swampy, slow-burning Southern Gothic blues and erotically charged balladry built around smouldering bottleneck guitars, spooky church organ and distorted keyboard bass. Subtle shades of flamenco, electronic sound effects and classical orchestration from a nicely understated string section further enrich the mix. And Polly's versatile, deep, muscular singing voice has a new power and range that reveals the operatic training she underwent while writing this record. <br />It's just as dark as before, only in a different way. Dry and Rid Of Me were full of youthful anger and reactive, externalised rage. This album sees Harvey growing up and coming of age a lot. There's still some morbid horror and confusion on the record, but less anger. Now she's more concerned with the nature of longing and loneliness, desperate melancholy, a spiritual yearning and existential pain that's harder to define.<br />I think the reason listeners find this album more accessible than her others is simply because it sounds so much more mature and sophisticated. Flood's production is tastefully elegant, giving Harvey's songs room to breathe and echoing his past work with U2, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and Smashing Pumpkins. He brings out the space, texture and depth of sound in her songs, and the overall sound is more luxurious and resonant as a result. The exotic atmosphere is rich, vivid and well captured on every track. Also, Harvey projected a playfully seductive image, sexy attitude and elaborate theatrical glamour for this album's videos and tour that made people sit up and take notice.<br />Ultimately though, what makes To Bring You My Love such a masterwork is its raw power and simmering passion, the brooding emotional intensity, the pure heart and guts and soul that pours out nakedly from every note of the record.<br />PJ Harvey sings these ten songs like her life depended on it, and no other modern artist can convey such dizzy extremes of emotion in their music.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a realy great cd. It is relaxing and is full of songs to sing along to. I love to put on some cozy Ralph lauren jammies and lay by the fire with candles flickering singingaong  to complicated....  its a great R and R Time.
B00004YW6I|5.0|This is the best album of PJ Harvey's distinguished career. If you're a new fan I'd strongly recommend starting with this album because it's much more accessible and approachable than her previous six records. It welcomes the listener in a lot more than before.<br />STORIES FROM THE CITY, STORIES FROM THE SEA is full of radio-ready, arena-sized, feel-good rock'n'roll anthems that suit her massive, soaring voice to perfection like Big Exit, This Is Love, One Line and Good Fortune. These are classic three-minute pop songs built around crystal-clear electric guitars, cleanly streamlined production, lush melodies and infectiously catchy choruses that nag in your brain forever. They are refreshingly simple and direct. On these songs Polly seems to be celebrating life and having fun with it, enjoying her hard-won confidence and independence, revelling in her restless wanderlust and thirst for adventure. There is great joy, happiness and positive energy oozing from a lot of these songs. The video for Good Fortune captures the spirit perfectly - Polly joyously dancing around lampposts and swinging her gold handbag high in the air. She's never sounded so playful, exuberant and high on life before, and it's a very refreshing change to see Polly in this new light. <br />The rest of STORIES features swooningly romantic torch ballads and sexy, atmospheric love songs like the sweet country-ish waltz You Said Something and the sublimely gorgeous Thom Yorke duet This Mess We're In (why wasn't this released as a single?!). The closing track We Float is an unforgettably beautiful, heart-melting tearjerker. And for those who prefer Harvey's old wounds there's still the nicely sharp edges and raw anger of the punky Kamikaze and The Whores Hustle And The Hustlers Whore.<br />Both Island Records and Harvey herself worked hard milking this record for all its worth - doing hundreds of promotional interviews, radio station appearances and a year-long concert trek that included a support slot opening for U2 on the three-month US leg of their mega-successful Elevation tour. STORIES brought Harvey to a wider audience, enjoying more commercial success and a longer shelf life than her previous records, though it didn't really deliver on the record label's greater crossover hopes. It didn't catapult her to the stadium venues she was born to play or bridge the gap from indie critics darling/cult icon to household name pop superstar. Or bring her a mainstream success comparable to the likes of Bruce Springsteen, The Pretenders, Blondie or Easter-era Patti Smith (the artists whom she resembles most on this record).<br />But it's good to see that it won strong critical support and deservedly took the UK's 2001 Mercury Music Prize for album of the year. STORIES FROM THE CITY, STORIES FROM THE SEA is an absolute masterpiece that's destined for future classic status. No self-respecting good record collection is complete without it - I urge you to go buy it now!
B00005JKZT|1.0|Although the first installment did a good job following the books and capturing their mood, Two Towers does not.  It is not a good movie.<br />Specific points:<br />1.  This movie drags, it is boring.  Compared to the first, it has the appearance of being done on the cheap.<br />2.  The elves, a major force in the books, are all wrong.  The emotionless long-eared beings in this movie are just an army of fightin' robot Star Trek Vulcan elves, not Tolkien's complex creations.  Lord of the Rings is well loved and well understood.  It is puzzling how they could spend so much money creating these movies and get such an important component so wrong.<br />3.  Where is Enya?  Too costly?  She made a major contribution toward getting the right feel in the first movie.  This score sounds like the movie producers picked it up cheap as a reject from a \\"Columbo\\" made-for-t.v. movie.  Worse, at the end, when the credits are rolling and everyone is sighing in relief you have to walk out of the theater listening to some kind of sultry torch song that would be much more at home closing a James Bond movie.<br />4.  As the movie ignores Tolkien's plot (to its detriment), it is difficult to follow even if you have read Tolkien.  This extra-long movie spends way too much time on one boring siege.  <br />5.  The special effects, siege and all, are nothing special.  Gollum looks fake, sort of a \\"Roger Rabbit\\" cartoon flashback.<br />This being said, the casting is still great and the actors do the best they can with the poor material. <br />All in all one would get much more benefit and pleasure from staying home and reading, or re-reading, the books.  Hopefully, watching this lousy adaptation won't sour too many people on Tolkien's great works.  This is all kind of sad, if they had kept up the pace of the first movie it could have been a great series.
B00000AFFI|5.0|PJ Harvey has always been underrated. She is an incredibly talented artist and yet not widely known by many people. She gets great press reviews and has her own cult following, but not much support from radio or MTV. <br />When Is This Desire? was released in 1998 it kept her core fans happy but there were some odd, griping critics who were disappointed by it. I think they sorely underrated the album and just misunderstood it. For it's clear to anyone with intelligence and good taste that this is one truly BRILLIANT album. PJ says herself that it's her strongest album and her personal favourite out of any she's released. And after all I think she knows best!<br />The opener Angelene is an epic, bittersweet, slow-burning country ballad full of twangy slide guitar riffs and tinkling grand piano. It's an extremely romantic song, a mixture of sadness and joy, hurt and hope for the future. Bruised but optimistic. When her husky voice blooms into full throb on the chorus - \\"Two thousand miles away/He walks upon the coast/Two thousand miles away/Lays open like a road\\" - it just takes your breath away and sends shivers down your spine. <br />The River is a piano-driven love song that is hauntingly beautiful and dreamy, and PJ sings it with such heartfelt sincere emotion that it's almost painful to listen to. A Perfect Day Elise is deliciously catchy and danceable, with a deep dark bass groove that pulls you deep into the song. Other tracks see her revisiting her harder guitar-rock roots or experimenting with electronic styles like jungle, industrial and ambient trip-hop to very stylish and powerful effect. It's near-impossible to choose highlights from Is This Desire? because the whole album is an absolute winner, packed with standouts from beginning to end.<br />By the way Harvey's astonishing lyrical skill on this album rivals the very best of rock's all-time master wordsmiths and elder statesmen: people like Lou Reed, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and of course the grandaddy of them all - Bob Dylan. Yes, she's really THAT good a songwriter.<br />In my opinion Is This Desire? is the greatest of all PJ Harvey's albums and an essential CD for any music-lover's collection.
B000002AGN|5.0|Take Five holds the almost unique characteristic of being both a revolutionary jazz albumn, and an albumn that remains emminently listenable almost 40 years afoter its release.<br />The combination of Brubeck weaving time signatures on the piano which no one had ever heard before, and Desmond's beautiful sax can not be beat.  Blue Rondo remains a classic jazz exposition of how melody and harmony intertwine (listen to the Al Jarreau version--he puts the musical message into words).<br />Anyone who thinks Kitaro and Yanni are the be all and end all of jazz, or who listens to &quot;smooth jazz&quot; should give Take Five a try.  It is eminently listenable, and you will definitely see what you have been missing.
B00006BTCA|5.0|How ironic, yet how fitting, that my last review for 2002 covers one of the very best CDs to come out this year. Interpol comes out of NY, like the Strokes, and I find it to be the perfect companion CD to &quot;Is This It&quot;.<br />This collection of 11 songs (49 min.) gets a soaring start with &quot;Untitled&quot; which for some reason reminds me of the Stone Roses' &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot;. &quot;Obstacle 1&quot; and &quot;PDA&quot; are the best tracks of the album, guitar-driven, very high-energy. Other oustanding tracks include notables include &quot;Say Hello to Angles&quot; and &quot;Stella&quot;.<br />Whether Interpol will be able to climb out of critical acclaim to mass-popularity remains to be seen (which sadly says says a lot about today's music industry, as Interpol gets virtually no airplay). On the account of their impeccable debut album, they sure deserve it. In mid-January they will visit Cincinnati,  and that is one concert I am really looking forward to!
B00005JCAA|5.0|I have watched this film many times. I am always amazed at how Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt capture my attention.<BR>This film causes one to openly deal with Death.<BR>A must see if you want to be entertained and end the movie on a positive note.
B00005JKHP|4.0|For years fans have referred to this film as &quot;star trek: the motionless picture&quot;, but if that was appropriate then this new version of it could be called &quot;star trek: the 'oh my it seems to be twitching' picture&quot;. Director Bob Wise, finally able to finish the film as he had originally wanted, at last reveals to us what he was really thinking, what the film really should have been. It's still not Star Trek as we otherwise know it, but it makes sense now, holds together, feels more right. Kirk doesn't seem like such a jerk, Spock doesn't seem like such a stiff, McCoy doesn't seem to be suffering so badly from uncontrollable anger. Special effects are greatly improved and are more interesting than they were. <br />Overall, where this used to be a film I could take or leave, it's now a film that I enjoy somewhat and watch from time to time. Friends that have watched this new version with me generally seem to agree.
B00005JKZT|3.0|The Two Towers is by no means a bad movie. In fact it's better than most of the ones that came out this year, i only liked three movies better (minority report, punch drunk love, and gangs of new york). The epic battles scenes will take your breath away, and the sweeping vision of Peter Jackson is like candy for the eye. Unfortunately, The Two Towers has hardly any depth to it, unlike its predecessor. I found myself not really caring about the characters in this sequel, and had a hard time really getting into the movie. The first film was so fantastic tht it's difficult to live up to, and sadly this didnt. Even if it isn't a great movie, it's a good fun time. Three hours of top notch action and excitement make for a very enjoyable adventure. Just don't expect a top calibur film.
B000069HK2|5.0|I was at first hesitent to listen to whole &quot;screamo&quot; scene.....but i had listened to all the othe emo bands, and i was looking for something more.  I had heard about the used a while back but i actually sat down and listened to it the other day.  I didn't know what i was missing.  I am kicking myself for not listening to this band before, so many hours wasted with less talented bands in my CD player.  All the songs are amazing.  I can't get enough.  If you like emo, punk, or even harder stuff, pick up this CD, its worth it
0316666343|4.0|Well written and insightful. To those that complain that Suzie becomes wise beyond 14 as the book goes on, I point out that she had been the proverbial fly on the wall for some time. And her murder took more than her life, but her innocence. <br />A few years ago, I lost my mother to cancer. She was youngish to succumb and never saw her grandchildren. I have dreams where she and I talk on the phone, where we always got along best while she lived. Sebold's novel evoked this for me. Now, as a mother myself, this book raised the question of what would I do if one of my children were to be taken from me. Would I retreat? Would I play amateur sleuth? Would my marriage survive?<br />I don't know the answers to those questions, but, Sebold left me with hope. This book could have been such a downer and it wasn't. Though I wept a great deal while reading it. Mostly my tears were filled with joy and gratitude that I am tied to the earth and my wonderful family.<br />Read it in good health while those you love are safe in their own beds!
B00005JKZT|5.0|\\"The Two Towers\\" leaves off exactly where \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" ended. Sam and Frodo have embarked on their journey to Morden alone. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolis have gone in search of the kidnapped Hobbits, Merry and Pippin. And Merry and Pippin are being transported on the backs of marauding Orcs. Director Peter Jackson throws the audience headfirst into each of these plots, with the only nod to the twelve month gap between theatrical releases being a recap of Gandolf's fall into the abyss. As Middle Earth tries to defend against Sauruman's enormous military conjuring, the ring and Frodo's responsibility to destroy it seem almost irrelevant since the world must first survive the onslaught of military evil.<br />Is the movie good? Yes, very. Is it better than the first? It depends on what kind of movie you like. The first is an adventure/friendship movie while the second is more of a war movie, with everything leading up to an enormous battle scene. I found \\"The Two Towers\\" to have less drive and cohesion than the first, since the three plot lines remain separate and distinct. Jackson spends too much time showing us Merry and Pippin as they walk around with an Ent; in the interest of the dramatic medium, this should have been pared down, especially since these two Hobbits are not driving forces. Still, the acting is good (Mortenson as Aragorn is even more charismatic than he was in the first),and the story line is riveting. As with the first, the cinematography is breathless. The creation of Gollum, the poor tortured soul who is consumed for his need for \\"my precious\\" is simply brilliant. Wait until you see the wizardry of Gollum's computer generation! He is reminiscent of Yoda - but only if you could imagine Yoda as anguished, malnourished, mentally unstable, and consumed by the lure of the dark force.<br />If you saw \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and liked it, you won't want to miss \\"The Two Towers.\\" If you didn't understand what the fuss was the first time around, you won't find enough to hold your interest in the second installment.e around, you won't find enough to hold your interest in the second installment.
B000005JA8|1.0|Yawn.  This album has two serious problems, both of which would be forgivable if the other wasn't present.  First, it shows nearly no musicality (and I'm not just talking about harmony or melody, but the presence of any kind of music).  Second, it is terrifically boring.  I can't think of any circumstances that would cause me to listen to it again.<br />Back to the loch with you, Nessie.
B000002WNP|5.0|Most of you have your favorite era of his music. I like them all in different ways, but I like the sixties best, and this box shows why. There were many aspects to his music, but this set focuses on those secular recordings that were made in the studio and which were not connected to a movie. The best of the movie music is available on Command performance - Essential sixties masters volume 2, which I've already reviewed, while the gospel and live recordings are also available separately.<br />With those exceptions, every song Elvis recorded during the sixties is here. These include most of his big hits from the period, among them It's now or never, Are you lonesome tonight, Surrender, His latest flame, Good luck charm, Suspicion, She's not you, Don't cry Daddy, In the ghetto and Suspicious minds. Of course, there are a few missing, because they were from the excluded categories, but anybody who wants a Greatest hits collection will find plenty to choose from.<br />Apart from the hits, you get all the album tracks, many of them long forgotten except by fans of Elvis. These include covers of Fever (Peggy Lee), Memphis Tennessee (Chuck Berry), And the grass won't pay no mind (Neil Diamond), Just call me lonesome (Eddy Arnold), Gentle on my mind (Glen Campbell), I'm movin' on (Hank Snow) and I'll hold you in my heart (Eddy Arnold) among them.<br />Among the songs written for Elvis but which remain obscure to all but his fans, there are many good songs, any of which might one day be rediscovered and used in a movie or TV advertisement. The song Gently, from one of his early sixties albums, was translated into French and recorded by Petula Clark. I can't ever remember another cover of this song in any language, though there probably is one somewhere - just one of many great songs in this set that you're not likely to hear on the radio.<br />The last half of the final CD is made up of selected alternate takes of some of the songs, although the most famous alternate take, his laughing version of Are you lonesome tonight, is not among them. Nevertheless, this is a fine collection which will appeal to a far wider public than just his dedicated fans.is laughing version of Are you lonesome tonight, is not among them.

0380977788|5.0|Coraline is the story of a girl who finds a sort of 'parallel universe' behind a bricked-off door in her family's new apartment.  Like all good parallel universes, there are non-equivalent copies of most everything from her own world.  This universe is like her apartment, except that everything in run down and nasty.  In her normal world, Coraline has a neighbor in the upstairs apartment who enjoys playing with pet mice.  In her parallel world, the man in the upstairs apartment is made of rats.  While there are many things, written in wonderfully creepy detail, for you to discover about the parallel world that Coraline discovers, perhaps the best of all is her 'Other Mother' who is like her own mother, but has buttons for eyes, wants to sew buttons onto Coraline's eyes, and is holding Coraline's real parents hostage.  Predictably, but not unsatisfyingly, Coraline's mission becomes to find and rescue her parents from the wicked 'Other Mother'.<br />Written for young adults, Coraline, is a thoroughly enjoyable story.  It is detailed enough to have some weight, creepy enough to feel original for a YA novel, and quick enough to hold the interest even of non-YA readers who enjoy a bit of fun.  Being a non-YA reader myself, I liked it quite a lot.  In fact, I think I read it in about 2-3 hours.  Those who enjoy the Harry Potter series will likely enjoy this novel as well.<br />For those considering this novel for children, do know your child and perhaps read it yourself ahead of time.  Most children old enough to read this themselves will have no trouble, but younger ones may end up with nightmares about disembodied hands crawling through the grass if a parent or older sibling reads it to them.
B00005JKZT|5.0|First off, to all you Tolkien snobs saying \\"Oh no! Faramir's character was slaughtered!\\" and \\"Oh the Ents didn't get enough screen developement!\\" I say, don't look a gift horse in the mouth! Come on! The average person watching the movies hasn't read the books, and Peter Jackson must cater to this. The movie is already 3 hours long, and to bow to the fans every desire would be suicide.<BR><br /><br />A decent amount of fans are overlooking the fact that, these movies even exist to complain about in the first place. The computer effects are some of the best I've seen. Gollum is all CGI and I've never seen such a real CGI character! He's by far the star of the film. And another great thing about the CGI, is that Peter Jackson doesn't rely on it. It's there to bring Tolkien's world to life, but he makes his foundation on acting! The actors are superb. Frodo is starting to become distant as the ring dessimates him. Sam is getting more worried by the day. Aragorn is starting to show the stress of the quest, Gandalf is back but now distant, he doesn't even remember his name! Merry and Pippen become more entrenched with the battle for Middle Earth, as they urge the Ents into battle. Gimli and Legolas are a bit lacking in their supposed friendship, but it's easily overlooked as the battle for Helm's Deep encompasses them.<BR><br /><br />This film is damn good. All I'm hearing from Tolkien purists is little nit picky things about the characters. What I don't see, is them having their eyes wide open enjoying it for what it is! It's an awe inspiring film. Full of laughter, passion, war, hope, or even a lack of hope. These characters have chemistry, unlike Star Wars: Episode I or II, where the characters feel dull and inconsiderate of others... a lot like plastic figurines. Lord of the Rings; however, brings a full range of emotion to the silver screen. Peter Jackson has done a great job melding all three subplots in one seamless 3 hour movie.<BR><br /><br />For all the moaningand griping I hear, I do feel sorry for all the whiny Tolkien fans, because these films are the best they're going to get. A huge budget, a great cast of characters, and a really good story that takes place over three films. It's too bad all the fans (that don't realize this) can enjoy it for what it is! And that being, their only chance at a good LOTR movie.<BR><br />
B000056BOR|5.0|Some reviewers have claimed that this movie is dated and perhaps corny.  I say that this movie isn't dated at all and that perhaps people being bothered by their conscience, while funny in this movie, is something that can still happen.<br />That Touch of Mink is a hysterical movie that pokes a little bit of fun at innocent Doris Day's conscience.  Going around town in Bermuda, you get to see Day thinking to herself \\"They all know!\\" while she pictures that the elevator she is standing in is actually a canopy bed.  It's funny.  The movie is just good, clean fun.  Something that many will find refreshing in this day of overly action-packed, sex-driven movies.  I hope that someday movie makers will look back on older movies and realize that they can make good movies without boat loads of sex and violence.  That Touch of Mink is a great example.<br />At any rate, I suspect that those interested in purchasing this DVD have already seen and enjoy the movie.  The DVD is letterbox (not widescreen, for those who care), digitally remastered (though some reviewers have argued poorly and I have to agree), and contains a theatrical trailer.  Because this movie came out some years before I was born, I really got a kick out of being able to see the trailer for the first time.  I could almost imagine a new hobby in collecting theatrical trailers of old movies.
1567184855|5.0|I couldn't recommend this book more highly. It eliminated any lingering fear of death I had, and explained in detail several hundred questions I still had after studying metaphysics for 25 years.  A friend loaned me her copy to read, but I'm buying it for myself. I think this book should be required reading for everyone on Earth, and the world would be a better place.  After you read this, you'll want to read \\"Destiny of Souls\\" too. Same great information...loads of details about the \\"afterlife\\".  <br />Enjoy, I did!<br />(Beware of reviewers who cast personal judgements and can't type or spell...)
B00000099Y|5.0|This the best cd I ever bought .Tool is the most unique band I ever listend too. It seems like most metal bands these days are going with the flow. They find a certain sound that they like and stay with, usually soundinng almost like others bands of there genere. But tool is different. Changing there sound from each cd trying to become better and better. Aenima is one of the best alblums ever. it has all original riffs and bass lines. <BR>(would you wear a bra on stage)
B00005BL2A|2.0|Okay, okay, sure, maybe this album is too subdued, maybe calling it &quot;Exciter&quot; was a cruel joke, but I am not gonna criticize it for that. There's nothing wrong with making a chill-out album. I prefer subdued to the forced danciness of DM's first 3 albums, and I actually like the production on this one a lot.<BR>And even though some reviews here said there isn't a single memorable song/melody here, I personally think a few of the songs actually have instantly noticeable, catchy melodies. There are also some growers. At least Dream On, Freelove, I am You, Sweetest Condition, Goodnight Lovers and When the Body Speaks belong to either of these two categories.<BR>The rest of the album is uninspired melodically (typical of Depeche to choose one of the blandest songs, I Feel Loved, as a single) and yes, I am also not quite sure what Dead of Night was supposed to represent. Still, 6 out of 13 wouldn't be too bad. I mean, it would be a decent album at least, if not great.<br />But now on to the catch: the lyrics on this album are so unbelievably bad, that they stick out like a sore thumb that absolutely NOTHING can cover up, not even Dave Gahan's voice, which has always been the high point of Depeche Mode for me (and Martin's voice also, which has matured really well over the past few years). Dave's vocals here are different, mellower, gentler (he already started going that route on 'Only When I Lose Myself' and 'Surrender'), and the way he sings the chorus of Freelove is enough to make one melt, but here again, the lyrics alternate from cringeworthy to laughable and basically ruin everything. Lyrics have never been THE most important thing for me when it comes to songs (more of a music/vocals type person) but when you spend more time being embarrassed about an album than you do trying to enjoy it, it's bad.<br />And another thing: ENOUGH with the instrumentals/intermezzos! They made Ultra (which I love) drone on more than it should, and here they are even less necessary. Why did they have to be singled out into tracks? The only time such &quot;connections&quot; and &quot;interludes&quot; in between songs ever worked for DM were on Violator, and coming close to that one is proving more and more impossible as years go by. The vocals are one of the best things about Depeche Mode. Use them.<br />Exciter is not DM's worst album. . . It's better than Speak and Spell, A Broken Frame, and Construction Time Again. <BR>Songs of Faith and Devotion is an atrocity that gets 1 star for In Your Room. <BR>But the ridiculous lyrics completely destroy Exciter, and unfortunately bring it very close to these less thrilling Depeche albums. This should be a textbook example of leaving well enough alone when saddled with writer's block.
6304595247|1.0|It's hard to put a finger on this film.  ... but the fact remains that Emily Bronte would NOT have recognized this as her novel.<br />It's interesting that many of the recent \\"anti\\" opinions have come from UK users - many of them from the North of England.  There is probably a reason for that:  as natives of the North they may well recognize a lack of authenticity - a certain \\"plasticity\\" in the sets, costumes and emotions.  <br />Certainly \\"Wuthering Heights\\" - the novel - doesn't pretend to be a slice of reality, but nevertheless, its author (for all her famous reclusiveness) knew her local history and inhabitants.  Her descriptions of people and places ring true - even in the early years of the 21st Century.<br />Where, then, does this version go wrong?<br />Firstly, I have to question seriously how carefully Peter Kosminsky read his source material.  \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a cussed book that doesn't fit comfortably into any film mogul's neat pigeon holes.  Previous film versions have tried to turn it into a classic \\"romance\\" and have, in the process, fatally diminished the power of the writing.  It isn't a \\"romantic\\" story at all, but this version - in spite of early and promising signs to the contrary - eventually treads the same, familiar route.<br />Ralph Fiennes was an interesting, if misjudged, choice for Heathcliff.  There are indications that - if given the opportunity - he could have produced a fascinating performance.   Occasionally and (very) briefly he provides flashes of brilliance which make you wish he could have followed his own instincts.  All too plainly, however, he was being constrained by his paymasters.<br />Juliette Binoche stood no chance as either of the Catherines.  She was young, French and at sea.  Asking ANY young actress to get her brain \\"around\\" Catherine the Elder AND Catherine the Younger would have been inconceivable:  asking a young FRENCH actress to do so was total insanity.  To her eternal credit, Ms Binoche comes out the chaos with her dignity intact - but I somehow doubt she includes this film on her CV too often.<br />...  Mr Fiennes does a stalwart job with an impossible man but - possibly due to post-production cuts - the end result is \\"just\\" grubby and ill-tempered.  There WAS a superb performance in here somewhere - and at another time, with another Director, it might have been a different story.<br />Is it worth watching?  Well - perhaps - on a wet day when you have nothing else better to do.  Janet McTeer is - as always - superb as Nelly Dean and Jeremy Northam stakes his claim as the tormentor-turned-tormented Hindley (and I think I agree that there was a Heathcliff in there somewhere ...).  <br />The music by Ryuichi Sakamoto is memorable - and has subsequently rightly become a collector's classic.  The choices of location are interesting and beautiful, but a little dubious as far as Emily Bronte's original \\"vision\\" is concerned.  She had in mind an amalgam of the landscape outside Halifax and her own local moors - NOT the clint fields of Wharfedale.  Cinematically, they're stunning - but pragmatically, they're distracting.<br />This is an interesting film, but it's NOT \\"Wuthering Heights\\" - and towards the end I actually began to find it a bit boring - not to mention unintentionally hilarious.<br />For an afternoon's undemanding entertainment, this is fine.  ...
0316666343|4.0|I finished this story at 2:30 this morning.  I was close to the end and wanted to finish the story.<br />Ok... here's the deal:  Suzie is murdered and narrates to the reader how those closest to her cope with her death.  She has a unique perspective; she tells her story from her heaven.  In many ways, her description of life in heaven is comforting yet practical.  Suzie addresses her longing for those she left behind on earth and her frustration at not being able to fully connect with them.<br />The author, Alice Sebold, paints vivid characters in her story and one cannot help but develop affinity and angst for those described.  In and amongst the depictions, there are a series of \\"little happy endings\\" and real responses to grief, anger, and abandonment.  Suzie celebrates her sister's successes and supports her brother's struggles to accept what has happened.  She worries for her father and largely leaves her mother to her own devices.  She longs for Ray and she watches Ruth. Largely, her narrative is light, humorous, and entertaining.  She is never morose, never macabre.<br />Yet, after the climax of the story, Sebold lapses into cliche and her characters lose their vibrant multi-dimensional personaliities and lapse into cardboard characters who respond predictably.
B00006RU5B|5.0|All of the people bashing this cd, and I'm glad there aren't many, need to realize that this ISN'T Rage.  This is Audioslave.  Rage is over.  Hopefully not forever, I am a huge fan and hope that they come back one day, but for now they are done.  Keeping that in mind this is a great new band.  I love Morello's sound, not only the solos, but the sound he gets out of the guitar.  My favorite song is show me how to live
B00006RAKP|5.0|This is the best album I think I have listened to in a long time.You will not be disapponted.Every song that Elton has made famous is on this album.From his classics such as &quot;Your Song&quot; to his more recent hits such as &quot;I Want Love.&quot; If you aren't a fan of Elton John you will be once you listen to this album.
B000000W6R|4.0|This album is so often overlooked and swept in the shadows of the Pumpkins anthology, and it is a shame. This is a more stripped down album compared to more extravagant productions like Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie, but at its core, it is still just undeniably good music. There is more of an acoustic touch to this album, and a more airy feeling throughout, with not as many heavy, raging tunes. Even the harder-edged songs (pissant, hello kitty kat) seem to have a soaring quality in the context of this album. However, the more acoustic songs demonstrate the softer side of the pumpkins, from the simple, yearning, \\"Soothe\\", to the lilting \\"Whir\\", to the hauntingly beautiful \\"Obscured\\". Either way, this album has a definite overall texture to it, one that is both ethereal and tangible. Very good stuff. Give it a try.
B00006X06U|4.0|Still pushing at boundaries and still moving forward as an artist Mitchell here revisits and sometimes reinvents her own back catalogue with wonderful results.<BR>The songs,recorded with full orchestra,sound fresh and open.Joni's voice is a little darker than when a lot of these songs were written but still runs around the tunes like a child at play.If you are new to the music of Joni Mitchell this is a fine place to start and long time fans will soon be digging out the old discs and comparing the different versions.<BR>Enjoy
0066214122|5.0|Michael Crichton has again succeded in getting the combination of technical and thrilling moments in the book. Like all his books he is very much bothered about consequence of a new technology that can have unpredicatble results unforseen. Characters in the book were mostly one dimensional but Crichton anyway focuses more on plot than on characterization. Must read for all Crichton fans.

B00001MXXG|5.0|So what if I was a &quot;mini-me&quot; when this movie first premiered? I still think it's &quot;so choice!&quot; Well, every now and then I shudder at the sight of Jennifer Grey, Miss-Dirty-Dancing in tights and those 80's nike sneakers. But looking past that, this is the best teen movie ever made, and the message of ditching school to see the world is so extensive and universal that Ferris Bueller's Day Off will be a classic forever. If I, being a modern-day teen, can enjoy this movie, then I'm sure anyone my age will love it like the way the now grown-ups enjoyed this movie in 1986. Perhaps the only sadness that this movie will bring is the thought of how quickly time goes by...Look at Matthew Broderick, he was basically my age when he played Ferris Bueller and now, he's my parents' age. But whatever you do, take this advice &quot;life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and take a look around once in a while you could miss it&quot;
B00006RU5B|2.0|I was hoping that the talented musicians of RATM were being held back by the demands of Zach- they never were allowed to stretch out and live on the edge. Wverything was very planned and safe. Now I know that I was wrong. Never once on this album do I feel that the band is toeing the line or pushing its limits. I thought especially with the creative input on Cornell, that th band would expand its vocabulary. But it sounds like COrnell doing karaoke over throw away RATM tracks. As good as Morello can be, he NEVER stretches out and really lives on danger's edge. He is the most one of the most conservative guitar players out right now. He can make a few strange noises, but any player in their closet can do this and would get bored quickly. And the drummer NEVER throws anything in to catch your attention. Very safe. I know they can all do better than this. I just never felt that they were trying to push the envelope at all. Boring!
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book. I was drawn in immediately and my mind stayed on the book and its characters even when I wasn't reading! The book resulted in deep thoughts about the after life, appreciation for the present and regrets.  The author did a wonderful job. I'd highly recommend this to anyone and I plan to read it again.
B00005B36H|5.0|I went through a number of reviews to find some other opinions, and I was, quite frankly, stunned.  There were a number of super negative reviews that stated the album was boring, or uninspired, or just not old Tool.  Where have we heard this before?  Old Metallica vs. new Metallica.  Why is it that artists are not allowed to evolve?  The day of Opiate has long come and gone, folks.  People cannot be this angry forever!  Why can't an artist grow and learn and express this in their music?  If you were fortunate enough to see just one show on the entire Lateralus tour, you would understand the sheer beauty of this album.  There are sonic landscapes that undulate with gorgeous melody and darkness and elation and sadness.  Many said that several songs were repetative.  I personally don't mind hearing a great melody or a fantastic riff several times in repetition.  I am reminded of a line from the movie Amadeus here where the emperor claims that Mozart's opera has \\"too many notes.\\" He responds with \\"there are neither more nor less than I require.\\"  So it is with Tool.  There is a contemplative tone to the entire album.  I've heard many mention \\"dimestore Buddhism\\" as a comparison for the lyrical content of this album.  My opinion of this is better dimestore Buddhism than anything Britney or Limp Bizkit or N'Sync has to say.  The aim here is to create music that takes you to a new awareness - a new awareness of yourself and maybe *just maybe* inspires you to create something of your own or to read some new books and think about things in a different light.  I know that this will not be an album for everyone, but I just couldn't believe that people were actually calling it \\"garbage\\" when there is SO MUCH music being produced now that truly DESERVES that label.  It's unfortunate that many \\"old\\" Tool fans were really not fans at all...instead, they were meathead metal fans who liked to go to concerts and mosh around all angry... at the world.  The members of Tool are older.We all are.  Time to grow up a bit and begin to reflect.  And I said it before, simply the most important album I own.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|Normally I dont like pop or techno but these two combined with the beautiful voices of Lena and Yulia make the best cd ever. I've read posts about teenagers coming out to their parents about their sexuality because they finally found the courage to do it when they listened \\"200 KM/H In The Wrong Lane\\". I noticed everyone in my house, ages 10 to 43, humming the different songs without even realizing they're doing it. From the slow melodic music of \\"30 minutes\\" to the up beat techno music of \\"Clowns\\" every song is great!
B00005YW4H|4.0|When I bought this album, I really didn't know what to expect.  It was kind of an impulsive buy, actually: in the store they had a special stand where you could listen to Norah's album, and I listened to the first few tracks, then I decided to buy the album.  And believe me, I'm not disappointed!  <BR>I had to listen to the album 5 times before I entirely got into it, but I thank God that I took time to do that, because this album is soo refreshing.  The first two tracks are definatly two of the best tracks produced by any artist this year.<BR>But I don't like the last song, I wish they would have taken 'The long day is over' as their last track; it would be a great way to finish this album.  I don't think that the tracks Norah wrote herself are actual stand-outs, but they're okay.<BR>For the rest, this album's totally great...Norah's voice got me hooked immediatly.  <BR>This girl's a great new artist and I hope that she'll release another album of the same quality soon!
B000002HAF|5.0|Rarely does an album come along that makes you want to play music yourself.In the case of the Pixies, that is exactly what happens.If you dont play music,you'll decide to; and if you already do you'll be inspired to play more.From the blistering &quot;bone machine&quot; to the euphoric &quot;river euphrates,&quot;this album has a unique and special feel that hardly ever comes around.The songs have a purity to them that stops them from sounding overproduced or thought about too much. It's like they just played and this great sound came out.(Part of this is due to Steve Albini who produced it).So,to keep this short, if you're looking for musical oblivion I suggest you get this album -and plenty of batteries for your walkman- because you won't stop listening to it.
0316666343|3.0|This novel has some great moments and endeavors to be touching, but in the end there is a corniness that permeates this novel. For a girl who died at 14 her narratives are steeped with a wisdom of the ages that is out of place. The way the violence erupts from a kindly neighbor in this friendly town hits a high dramatic note early that is not sustained and I thought it would've been better if the killer were not known to the reader as she steers the investigation along, because it took a lot of the interest out of it for me.
B000003TAL|5.0|You think you've heard some good albums in your life time? Think again. This album is beond good. This album defines the genre of music Sonic youth comes from. I listened to this record without knowing a single sonic youth song, and I was amazing at it's beauty and how different it was from all the other music I had listened to. As I listened to this album over and over again Sonic youth became one of my favorite bands and my ultimate influence on my musical carrer. Songs like &quot;Silver rocket&quot;, &quot;The Sprawl&quot;, &quot;Cross the breeze&quot;, &quot;Erics trip&quot;, &quot;Hey joni&quot;, and &quot;Trilogy&quot; still get to me today after two years of listening to this album. I think it's safe to say that this is the album of my lifetime and it will be years and years until I'm sick of it.
B000069AUI|5.0|Sometimes I listen to an album, and I think to myself, \\"This is complete rubbish.  I've only got so much 'ear time' to lend to good music, and here I am wasting it on this garbage.\\"  <br />Well, I've never said this once while listening A Rush of Blood to the Head.<br />Each song on this album is a journey.  It's intelligent.  If you don't start thinking differently after listening to the first track, \\"Politik\\" alone, there's something terribly wrong with you.<br />Sure, Coldplay doesn't go around smashing their guitars and flipping the world off.  Yet, they've got more energy and passion than most of the groups around today.  In my eyes, they're far from boring.<br />I'd reccomend anything by Coldplay to anyone.  This?  This is real music.
B000002IWQ|2.0|I am a long-time (since 1979) die-hard (every tour since 'Moving Pictures') Rush fan. Unfortunately, I believe that Counterparts is the worst Rush album ever released. Every once in a while I pull it off the rack and give it a spin...still no good. I give it 2 stars only because Rush at its worst is better than many bands at their best -- Rush could release an album of Britney Spears covers and still rate more than 1 star. Plus I'd feel guilty giving my heroes only 1 star. Bad Karma.<br />Anyway, overall the songs here are non-discript drivel backed by quasi-alternative noise. For example, the lyrics to \\"Animate\\" are unintentionally comical (\\"animate me, complicate me, elevate me\\"...oy vey), and the guitars sound like they were lifted from Nirvana or Soundgarden or one of those early '90s gritty alternative bands. <br />As for the oft-discussed \\"Nobody's Hero\\"...nice try, but it comes across as disingenuous -- Neil Peart trying to tell us all that he's enlightened and politically correct. I love the ideas behind the song, I embrace its politics, etc. etc., but I just don't (and never will) buy this sort of sentimentality  coming from Mr. Ayn Rand. Just to be clear here: it's not that Rush can't or shouldn't write about tolerance or, in this case, acceptance of homosexuality. It's that Rush should do it the way they do it best -- from a somewhat detached and objective (i.e., objectivist) POV, not from a personal and experiential one. I never ever want to hear another Rush song where anyone is singing about a party they went to (especially with a contrived rhyme) -- \\"I knew he was different in his sexuality / I went to his parties as a straight minority\\" -- I cringe every time I hear this.<br />As for the argument that Rush was just 'expanding their horizons' -- I think that's nonsense. Sure, Rush can change, but its 'voice' is its hallmark, and that should remain constant. On Counterparts, Rush sounds more like a follower who is trying hard to please everyone, ratherthan the musical leaders they are. <br />To sum up: Counterparts is not even remotely memorable, and is barely listenable. Buy anything and everything else from Rush, and you will be pleased. The old stuff is perfect, and their last two (Test For Echo and Vapor Trails) are both excellent, worthy of membership in the Rush canon. As bad as Counterparts is, Rush's most recent releases prove that Counterparts was only a brief lull, and not the demise of this truly fantastic band.
B00005JLS0|1.0|I just got home from seeing this movie,and man this is bad.They do have a couple of funny sayings,but this movie is just boring.And it seemed like it lasted way too long.Please avoid this bad movie like the plague.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I am a big Who fan so the real test for me was letting my college age, rap loving son listen to this album while on a long car ride. (I hate rap and I own the car so....) It was as if he had discovered rock and roll for the first time. Experiencing it with him brought me back to all the reasons why I am a fan and why this is such a great disc. The band's range on songs like A Quick One and the powerhouse drumming of Keith Moon on Amazing Journey/Sparks really demonstrate the power of this band at one of it's peak moments. My only regret was not getting the extened disc with the Tommy recordings included. Either way, this is a must for any Who collection.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Laundry Service es un album excelente, tiene muchisimos ritmos y la excelnete voz de esta colombiana, ademas las composiciones son las mejores, cabe resaltar los temas Objection (Tango), fool, the one, underneath your clothes, que me quedes tu, poem to a horse, whenever wherever
B00006CXXU|4.0|I was slightly disappointed when I first heard the cd because I had been waiting forever for it and the writing was not up to  par.  Some of the lyrics are just okay and some words seem to simple and just put together because they rhyme.  The more i listen though, the more I really love the cd.  There is definatly a variety of songs and music.  My favs are Walk Away (Bluesy-her voice is amazing in this song!), Underappreciated (kind of a funky motown song), Get Mine, Get Yours (beat and music fit well with lyrics), Keep On Singin My Song (Great uplifting song).  I do not like Make Over...sounds too much like Pink with Linda Perry but i like Christina's attempt to change her singing style with it.  Overall, this is a cd worth buying.
0380977788|4.0|Coraline is a quick, engrossing read, styled for children with themes all ages must explore.  Definitely worth the time, especially if you like Gaiman's layered, worlds-beyond-worlds style.  (And who doesn't?)  As for the idea posed in an earlier review, that this book need not have been written, I must disagree.  Certainly, it summons memories of The Phantom Tollbooth, etc- but as the opening quote states, fairy tales are important.  Stories are retold, reread, revisited, rewritten.  The process is cyclical, the way life is cyclical.  Coraline is innovative, yet classic.  We're going to fault an author for that kind of brilliance?<br />Read it.  Do.
B00005YW4H|5.0|There usually comes a time in a music lovers life where they get a little bored with what music is being released.  That was me until I heard Norah Jones...she totally rejuvinated my music passion.  This cd is one of the best of the year-no argument.  Her voice is soothing and beautiful-REAL.  The music arrangments and lyrics are great.  There's not a dull song on the cd.  \\"Come Away with Me\\" is SO wonderful.  The words are perfect, the piano is amazing and I just love the song!!  It's romantic and that of a dreamers song almost.  What i also like is that many emotions are expressed and overall compliment eachother so well.  If you do not own \\"Come Away with Me\\"- BUY IT!
B00005BF9Z|4.0|We're not sure where Mr. Chao is from (we know we read it        somewhere, but those brain cells must have met                     their maker since). No matter, for, as we can tell from his music, he is surely a citizen of the world                 and this record sounds like he has gotten hold                     of the one radio that hits every station in it. And               the dial is constantly spinning. The CD begins                   with a voice repeating, &quot;This station is dull,                     boring, dull&quot;. This record is anything but.                       French, Spanish, Portuguese (we think), and                       English(if not others)are spoken here. Among                      the rhythms there is reggae and mariachi and                     European (Eastern and Western) and                           American(North and South). And if we keep                          listening closely we're sure to find more. Do we                  hear a banjo? Is that the Good Humor Man?                         This is more than a novelty record. It is Around                  the World in 60 Minutes and the journey is                        unadulterated fun.
B000065U1N|5.0|From the opening to the end this one never stops or disappoints. Graphic portrayal of 1993 events in Somalia involving US military intervention in war torn Mogidishu. Special effects and rapid-fire editing give this portrayal of a dark tragedy in American military history. Ewan Mcgregor is almost unrecognizable in this!
0375414053|3.0|I want to give this book more stars - the same 'want' that forced my fingers to flip pages until 3 in the morning and finally convinced me to finish a book (which I don't think I'd done since becoming pregnant the second time, and he's just turned one.)  Kate Reddy's life so closely parallels my own that I think I did what many disappointed readers have done with this book - I read it looking for answers or hints or clues.  I wanted Allison Pearson to tell me how I could do it.  In truth this was an interesting, well written book that kept me engaged and I could easily identify with the characters.  Too easily.  Which is why, when it turned out that how she does it is that she doesn't, I felt as though my shiny red heart balloon which had been hopefully soaring towards the sky was suddenly caught on a barbed wire fence and subsequently taken as the bull's eye for every passing pigeon.  The ending spoke to me and it said, `this amount of stress can't even work fictionally, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!'<br />While this might prove to be worthwhile soul-searching for others, it was a detour I just didn't need to take.  As I've seen other reviewers comment, the big difference between Kate Reddy and many of the working mothers picking up this book is that the latter do not have a choice.  Rather, since I do believe we always have choices to make, many mothers' only Plan B is just as unappealing as their working scenario as it involves introducing equally debilitating amounts of stress felt uniformly across the family (translation - financial woes).  <br />I think I would be more likely to recommend this book to stay-at-home moms who need some reassurance and, unfortunately, I would strongly recommend that working mothers wielding gregarious consciences STAY AWAY.  It's not easy, and this doesn't make it any easier.
B000068TPN|5.0|Real life account of events of US Army Cav(the 7th) in Ia Drang valley in 1965. Good solid cast and awesome effects give this one a true-5 star rating even if Platoon is still the definitive Vietnam picture.
B000066NW0|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this cd.  I mean, I do like all of Avril's singles, but I figured that maybe her talent was only limited to those singles.  It isn't, and that's a good thing.  Avril has an extremely large amount of talent, and it is present in her debut album.  It is very unusual to find a debut cd that is so well-done and has such an interesting mix of sounds, especially in someone so young.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes music, but especially people who like to listen to truly talented young people.  You'll really enjoy this cd.
B00000G3BX|5.0|I just recently rec'd the video MULAN ..., and I must say the video was in EXCELLENT Condition.

B0000214F2|5.0|Patch Adams is a &quot;basesd on a true story&quot; type of inspirational comedy. While at times it may be hard to believe, I think the deeper message behind the film is very important, especially to those in the medical field. So what if doctors get emotionally involved with their patients? Being in the medical profession myself, I often find that things can be too cold and scientific. It's very refreshing to see a doctor who cares, a doctor with a heart. So while Robin Williams' character may be a little obnoxious and even somewhat unbelievable at times, this movie is downright heartwarming and inspirational.
B00005JKL8|1.0|Very loosely based on a true story, this movie is disappointing. Both hands are not enough to count the inaccuracies. Some good footage, but that does not save the plot which is very thin. Stay away.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|i actually downloaded this album before buying it. and wow. its really ... its orgasmic :D i love it. its really interesting and has awesome beats. the songs are very repetive. like if they are chanting these lyrics into ur ear. here is my breakdown of the album...<br />1 Not Gonna Get Us - this song could of confused me with Prodigy. lmao this song is great. awesome beat. it interesting. 3/5<br />2 All The Things She Said - Awesome! the lyrics are something every gay/lesbian person can relate to. i like it a lot. 4/5<br />3 Show Me Love - Show Me Love is ORGASMIC. i love it! the russian phonecall in the beginning is interesting to listen too. i like this song a lot. 5/5<br />4 30 Minutes - a sweet soft ballad. this song is okay. i dont like ballads so im gonna have to unbias here. 2/5<br />5 How Soon Is Now - they covered The Smiths. wooo. i think this is song is exceptionally good. i like it a lot. probably one of the most rockiest on the album. 4/5<br />6 Clowns - Clowns is an okay song too. its not a favorite but its listenable. i cant explain it. the whole cd is very dancy/ technoish. 3/5<br />7 Malchick Gay - this soudns like acoustic/ techno. i like it! i give it a 4/5<br />8 Stars - a midtempo ballad. i think the background music sounds very sexual. if that made sense. it has this russian rap in it. its very creative. i like it a lot... i like the ending too :D 4/5<br />9 Ya Shosla S Uma - the russian version of All The Things She Said <br />10 Nas Ne Dagoniat - the russian version of Not Gonna Get Us<br />11 Show Me Love (Extended Version) - this is my favorite track on the album. it doesnt have the russian phonecall in the beginning. its rock/techno. i love it! its basically the same as Show Me Love except extended. lmao 5/5
B00003CXXP|5.0|&quot;Whattayaknow?&quot; says Jude Law.  Great performances all around in this movie, especially from Haley Joel Osment.  Haley got some flack for this movie, as did Spielberg.  It's not for everybody.  However, if you are a fan of the old-school SF, this movie is for you.  The 2 DVD-set has a lot of interesting special features, making it a worthy addition to any collection.
B00003CXXI|3.0|Shrek got rave reviews over here, and everyone said it was brilliant.  I quite enjoy kids' movies (no blood, guts or horror ^_^) and I enjoyed other CG movies such as the Toy Story films, and Antz.  I also loved the idea of a movie satirising Disney fairy tales!  So I was very keen to see Shrek and had high hopes for it.<BR>Maybe that was the problem.  Because although I wasn't shocked by the movie, I definitely didn't come away bowled over either.  I didn't mind the animation or the music, so what was it?<BR>I don't really know, but having recently seen the movie again, I've come to the conclusion that Shrek has something nasty at its core.  I'm not sure what this is, but I do know that unlike Toy Story, Cats And Dogs or even the Hey Arnold! movie, Shrek leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<BR>Maybe it's the humour, which is either adult or toilet-related.  Okay, that's partly a personal thing (I don't really get on with that sort of humour) but I would have thought that a movie that sets itself up to be a parody would be able to generate humour from satire rather than flatulence jokes.  In fact, I don't feel that the movie was a successful parody at all.  It was more like a Disney story with gross-out humour and a slightly manic/nasty edge to it - that is, the worst of both worlds.<BR>The plot had some holes in it - why exactly did Farquaard arrest the fairy tale characters, and how did they then all end up in the swamp, for instance?  The characters were variable - I found Shrek unlikeable, Donkey was okay but swiftly got annoying, and Fiona was average.  I also didn't like the treatment of Fiona.  Note the way Shrek picks her up and carries her away, humiliating her because she won't do what he wants.  And the way he tries to shut her in the cave!  Also, how can people say the movie shows people can be good and evil, not one or the other?  Farquaard is just as wicked as any Disney villain.  <BR>There are some humorous parts to this movie, and some excitement, and some poignancy.  But it's not half as good as it's said to be, and as a biting satire on Disney movies, it fails miserably.
0066214122|4.0|This is one of those books that can receive the cliched comment, &quot;Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down.&quot;  While this is true for most of the book, the ending becomes quite far-fetched (even for a Crichton sci-fi) and is ultimately predictable.  It follows his tried-and-true formula to a fault.<br />What I found quite pleasant was that this novel was written in the first person, giving it an interesting twist.  As usual, the characters seems real, and the story comes to life.  <br />All-in-all, this is a good book, but should have had some more work done to it before its release.
B000066NW0|4.0|I'm not usually into the people who every one likes because I usually don't like their songs, but Avril has greats song I love &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Anything but Ordinay&quot; they are how I feel some times. Avril writes songs sometimes about not eing like every one else which is why I like her songs and maybe even if she didn't do it on purpose her songs are easy to sing with. If you want any more recomodaion on the radio on My 94.1(countdown for year 2002) &quot;Complicated&quot; was the number one hit for year 2002.Alot love Avrils songs so I would highly suggust it for all.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I cannot say enough or search for the appropriate words to describe this masterpiece, it's that good. First, it is a crime to compare her to a chosen few in the pop world. This album has proven that she is in a class all her own & has soared into a new musical frontier of super-stardom, talent, & diva hood. Multi-thumbs up to her involvement in writing, producing, & composing her own music unlike other pop stars. Fighter/Make Over should be her next single (an edgier sound, especially for CA). The song I'm OK is one of, if not, the most deep & emotionally significant songs ever written. It brought tears to my eyes. I am a huge music lover & own over 200 CD's, in different genres, & claim this album as one my all time faves. Everything about this album is unparalleled including the diverse music/sound, production, arrangement, lyrics, & her soaring Angelic vocals. GO BUY THIS ALBUM.  It's a brilliant masterpiece (...)..  You should too.ot even 10% of how good this sophomore LP is. Get this album and don't mis-judge what others say; oh yeah! Kelly Osbourne girl you really need to stop dissing Christina so please SHUT UP!s a fine line between slutty and sexy.  How can we listen to her gorgeous voice, when her buttocks are hanging out between leather bike chaps with the words dirrty inscribed on her panties? When little girls who idolizes her think it's okay to get nasty, take off your clothes and hump boys AND girls alike.  She would have our absolute respect the day she doesn't resemble a penny hooker.na wrote about her abusive father, have excellent lyrics but a melody that never seems to go anywhere.  \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" is a track about having a relationship based solely on sex.  The lyrics are so forthcoming (no pun intended), that many adults will find the track offensive, and they certainly won't want their kids to listen to it.  Then there's \\"Dirrty\\", the CD's first single and the only song on the album that sounds like typical teen pop.  Still, the lyrics tothis song aren't exactly a parent's dream, as they are far more \\"dirrty\\" than anything on Christina's debut album.  \\"Beautiful\\", a ballad being hailed by many critics as the best song on the album, fails to live up to the hype.  While its lyrics are very uplifting, its melody is not worthy of them.  <br />Overall, this album is a disappointment, not because of Christina's singing, but because of the songs she sings.  Christina has a voice that can make melodic songs sparkle, but the lack of melodic tracks on this CD don't give her the opportunity to do that as she did on her debut CD.  Although \\"Stripped\\" is being touted as an album for a \\"more mature\\" audience, even more mature adults enjoy songs that are, well, melodic.  While I give Christina high marks for her vocal abilities and her lyric writing skills, she isn't close to being a professional songwriter.  That, in the end, is what makes \\"Stripped\\" so bland.  It's a shame to waste such a great voice on tracks like these, and I hope that Christina will seek out some professional songwriters for her next CD.  In the end, \\"Stripped\\" may be an album in search of an audience.  It clearly isn't the teen pop most of Christina's fan base expects from her, and it may not measure up to the expectations of the \\"more mature\\" audience it was intended for.  \\"Stripped\\" proves that Christina is a great talent who simply needs a little help in the songwriting department.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I thought this film to be fascinating. I am not a fan of sci-fi films, and though there is a lot of it here, this is a drama, an intimate film set in a fantastical world. Luckily Spielberg did a good job with the screenplay -you can see Kubrick's touch there- and the movie turned out to be unlike anything I had seen and truly beautiful and strange. And Jude Law as Gigolo Joe is great. Hey Joe, what do yo know... .
6300270424|1.0|I'd discourage anyone's interest for any of these performances (VHS or DVD are both of bad quality). The sound and picture quality has to be the WORST I've ever heard from any live band. The sound is flat and gets drowned out easily. No matter how far sound quality standards have changed since the 1976 release of this movie, the sound remains as horrible as ever. As far as the picture, I've done better framing with my home camcorder.  As a TV and movie viewer in the 21st century, I've been too used to seeing several frames per minute, while this movie often shows the entire stage of the band playing instead of cutting to different frames, and belive me.. you'll go CRAZY.  In addition, the DVD is exactly the same as the VHS since it was originally recorded with [bad] analong systems in 1973 and is practically incapable of a good remaster. DO NOT BUY THIS. I was very disappointed as a big fan of Zeppelin to say the least. It is NOT worth the money. To add to the poor sound quality, the band played pretty poorly too. Some renditions were way too long and needlessly draggy. I understand the improvisational culture of blues music, but .... Robert's voice is also very weak and stripped and you almost NEVER see John Paul Jones. (Did Robert and Jimmy eternally hate that guy or what?).  The whole movie has been over rated since it's the only official Zeppelin live performance (I'm talking the REAL band with Bonham and all).  The Stairway to Heaven performance is very over rated too.  I was so disappointed in that.  I wouldn't recommend the soundtrack either, since it's the same songs with the same POOR quality.  It also lacks the live version of \\"Black Dog\\" which was one of the only decent renditions in the whole movie.<BR>For new Zeppelin fans, STAY AWAY FROM THIS.  It will only turn you off from the band completely since it does NO justice to their real power and talent.  For older fans... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  <BR>To sum it up, it's just a HORRIBLE movie and I wouldn'trecommend it to my worst enemy. No wonder it bombed at the box office in 1976.
B0000020C4|5.0|This CD is excellent!  First of all, the music is truly a masterpiece. . . the songs are melodic, emotional, and memorable, and the repetition of various themes throughout the recitative dialogues is very effective. At times, the music is very tense, but at other times, so tender and sensitive, a true outpouring of the human soul. I, for one, am dumbfounded as to why this great musical is leaving Broadway in March. . . but on to the cast of this CD.<BR>It seems as if the role of Jean Valjean was made for Colm Wilkinson.  I find it difficult to separate the actor from the character.  He seemingly effortlessly switches from a hard and cold misanthrop to a sensitive, caring, charitable individual.  He hits all his notes with confidence and adds some individual touches to the music.<BR>Philip Quast makes Javert into the most accurate foil to Valjean! He is so cruel and unfeeling, and seems so easy to hate, but it is impossible, because Philip plays him so magnificently.  His rendition of &quot;Stars&quot; is amazing, and his song before his suicide is the best portrayal of a tormented soul that I have ever heard!  These two actors alone MAKE the recording, but don't forget...<BR>Lea Salonga - Eponine - she has the most beautiful clear and precise voice.  She sings with such emotion, especially sadness and anger, and all of her songs are sung perfectly.<BR>Ruthie Henshall - Fantine - she sings so purely and innocently, and her voice is filled with sadness and regret, but also with a touch of hope.<BR>Michael Ball and Judy Kuhn - play Marius and Cosette wonderfully.  Although not my favorite characters, Marius sounds so starry-eyed and Cosette is so well-to-do and innocent.<BR>Michael Maguire is THE only Enjolras!  He sings with such conviction and power, and makes us really understand why a group of young students and bourgeoisie would take on the national army in a war.<BR>Les Mis is wonderful, and this recording is really a dream come true.  I recommend the video version too, because the characters are so incredibly believable.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Funny thing about how movies affect people differently. I'm the only member of my family never to have read the Tolkien books. When I saw \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\", I was unmoved and bored, but my family just raved about it, and so did everyone else: my negative review was blasted at 64 disagreeing! But this time, I was completely into and greatly enjoyed \\"The Two Towers\\". Lights go up, and my brothers are ticked off by the movie because it departs from the book, evidently. Go figure!<br />Yes, \\"The Two Towers\\" is a solid work that even someone unconversant with the original trilogy can follow. I see some reviewers found it harder to trace than \\"FofTR\\", but as a veteran of 1970s disaster movies like \\"Towering Inferno\\" where action cuts from group to group, I was perfectly able to go from subplot to subplot. The animation of the Gollom character is a tour de force, the battle scenes are riveting. Everything is working excellently in this epic.<br />Point that kind of got me, though: Evil Christopher Lee has been able to possess some king long distance and create all these monsters and such. An omnipotent kind of fellow, an evil wizard. But when the Ents come and destroy his environs, his only response is to look out the window? He doesn't even say anything? I thought that was a little Too Passive. He needs to get in touch with his anger. <br />Still and all, \\"Two Towers\\" stands way above the latest Star Wars movie, and in my opinion, above \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\".
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is an amazing album and addition to the SOAD collection.  It is almost as good as the self-titled album and way better than Toxicity.  Anybody that beleives Toxicity is better, they are not true fans of System of a Down, or they are punk rock fans that began listening to SOAD just because of the hit single \\"Chop Suey!\\" from Toxicity.  These people are [not smart] fans that just like them for their popularity.

B00005ATQG|5.0|In this film, Stanley Kubrick tackles an important and controversial problem : the love of a middle-aged man for a teenage girl who is rather a titillating character. The man falls in a trap and does not know how to get out of it. He marries the widowed mother to put his hands on the girl. But he becomes the absolute slave of his love and tries to enslave the girl without understanding she has only played with him against her mother and is still playing with him even if the mother is dead now. But Kubrick does not try to explain, to excuse, to understand the psychological reasoning or functioning of the man or the girl. He only gives us a rather cold and distant account of what happens. This shows how the girl is manipulated and also in a way frustrated and traumatised by the experience, and she has another older lover well hidden and leading her to all kinds of lies and fake attitudes. The girl will be led by her failing in capturing an older man as a sole and exclusive lover, she means of course the secret one who tries to get her involved in some kind of kinky filming, into accepting a love affair, mariage and family with a younger man, a man of her age, who is exactly the antagon of her own social position and of the older men she has been involved with : he is poor, he has bad hearing, he has no money and no prospect in society, he has no education, he is exclusively manual and his big dream is to go to Alaska to get some real opportunities there.<br />When the older man, realises that she is beyond any reach from him, he cracks up and gives her everything he has since he is not going to need anything for what he intends. And he intends his own justice, to destroy the man who supposedly soiled Lolita, in fact prevented him from capturing Lolita, because he is still convinced he could have done it. And he does kill him.<br />In this film there is no justification or no condemnation of love from an older man for a teenage girl. There is only the cold description of the consequences which are seen as definitely negative. The film also shows how the girl is playing with fire and manipulating older men to either compete with her mother or experiment with life. She is in a way a sexual bomb that will in the end accept the yoke of mariage provided it is with someone who is the opposite of all those men. She wants, in a way, to start from scratch, though she begs for money from her stepfather.<br />Such a non-committing approach is in a way a provocation in our society where we consider older men must not deal with teenage girls, adults must not get sexually involved with teenagers, love cannot exist between adults and teenagers. We are confronted to a lot of questions and no answers. In other words the film is unethical but thought raking.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignanthe consequences which are seen as definitely negative.

0316921173|2.0|I bought this massive book after reading Wallace's brilliant (and hilariously footnoted) critical essay on Bryan Garner's &quot;Dictionary of Modern American Usage&quot; in Harper's magazine. As I first dug in, my expectation was that reading &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; would be a lot of work but worth it in the end. For the first few hundred pages, this seemed like a reasonable expectation. Then Wallace dropped in a really obvious bit of foreshadowing, and I spent the next 600-odd pages waiting for the other shoe to drop ... and it never did! Baffled, I went back and read the last 100 or so pages again, only to find that he did, in fact, resolve the foreshadowing -- in two nondescript sentences which he then blew right past, dragging two subplots to the fore and leaving the main story completely without climax or resolution. The title turned out to be ruefully accurate: The story never really ended, and the jest was on me, the hapless victim of a 1,000-plus-page literary practical joke.<br />Wallace really is an exceptional word wrangler, and there are several scenes and a couple of footnotes that are laugh-out-loud funny, but on the whole &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; simply is not worth the effort it demands of the reader. After this experience, I flatly refuse to tackle any other Wallace work longer than a magazine essay.
B00007E8V4|5.0|yea YEA. this new offering to SOAD fans is sure to be appreciated by each and all. It starts out with the ridiculous \\"Chic N' Stu\\" that is sure to make you laugh with the catchy chorus of \\"Pepperoni and Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Olives, Chives!!\\" (Repeat) as it sweeps into the next track \\"Innervision,\\" starting out like a smack in the face that's sure to get anybody starting a pit of there own. Seeing that SOAD is claiming this to not be there official follow-up to their 2001 top selling album, Toxicity (*****), but a compilation of internet swapped songs. hey, fine by me! This album is hands down THE hardest album of 2002. I recommend you not walk but Flee ... and pick it up. ...
B00007E8V4|5.0|Who cares if these songs are b-sides, leftovers, or rejects, they [are good].  This cd is just as good, if not better than the other 2 SOAD CDs.  If you liked SOAD or Toxicity even the slightest bit, i recommend you buy this CD as soon as possible.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I actively hated this movie. After twenty minutes, I was looking at my watch, wondering how much more I could take. Instead of a movie about Navajo code talkers, this is just another silly Hollywood take on a disaffected white sergeant  who has to regain his humanity in the trenches after watching his former command die before his bassethound eyes. The battle scenes are endless, unbelieveable - and boring beyond belief. Cliches fly faster than the bullets and severed limbs. Nick Cage's character is badly conceived and poorly executed. The direction is uninspired, with lots of people jumping up for no reason and getting shot, then other people running to the rescue, and getting shot. Too bad the movie makers lacked the faith - and courage - to tell the story from the Navajo point of view instead of going for mock celluloid heroics that  undermine the sacrifice of real soldiers.
B00005JLRR|4.0|As a Star Trek feature film, \\"Nemesis\\" is at least in the top five (of ten). As a stand-alone science fiction movie, however, it is probably average.<br /><br />Screenwriter and self-described lifelong Trekkie John Logan (\\"Gladiator\\") indulged in a bit of wish fulfillment by shaking up things among the characters and trying out new toys. This is both a help and a hindrance in \\"Nemesis\\" case. The script has smatterings of inside jokes that aren't very funny and characters utter lines they'd probably never say in their television incarnations. And the introduction of a space dune buggy was distractingly embarassing, to put it kindly.<br /><br />But - all in all - the positives still outweight these negatives.<br /><br />The villain Shinzon is more than a two-dimensional psychopath. He's a three-dimensional neurotic! A clone of the Enterprise's captain, Jean Luc Picard, Shinzon is a case study in nature versus nurture. Possessing Picard's intelligence, passion, and strength, he is saddled with fears and pains that create a horribly vengeful and destructive man. Picard's face-to-face dealings with his double provide a \\"there but for the grace of God go I\\" mirror to his own life. Picard was raised by a provincial jerk but at least his childhood wasn't spent on a perpetually dark planet working as a slave. This is no excuse for bad behavior, however, and it's made clear that Shinzon does have the power to choose.<br /><br />Logan also purposely made the empath Deanna Troi useful for more than having unsure feelings about things and looking good in a revealing top. His solution was simple (maybe even implausible) but it had the virtue of novelty and poetic justice.<br /><br />The greatest hindrance is the Data subplot, which unnecessarily parallels the Picard story. Data finds (yet another) long-lost prototype for himself, the B-4 (aka, Data Gump). But it provides a back door for possible future stories.<br /><br />There won't be any future stories, however, if \\"Nemesis\\" gets even worse box office overseas than it did stateside. I hope that's not the case. This one was pretty good.stateside. I hope that's not the case. This one was pretty good.

B00000JGHM|5.0|HEAT dazzles with styles, grips, and thrills. Arguably one of the best in its era, just like the two main cast in this film - Pacino &amp; De Niro (with the appearance of these two names, no need to say more, unless you don't give a damn about movies). No other film in the same genre offers the whole-out satisfaction as it does for the entire one hundred seventy minutes. To blink would be a waste of time while watching it.<br />Instead of raving about it, it really depends on how individuals appreciate this masterpiece. If you find it boring and lengthy, you are probably one of those dumb-fun action seeker who rather watch Jean-Claude Van Damme splitting legs, and I strongly suggest you stay away from the film because you would be disgracing it.<br />The let downs of this DVD title, one is that seems like Warner Bros. did not do a very good job on video transferring. The picture looked stretched vertically on a normal TV. And two, with a film this standard, even though it is well-worth every penny paid for, should have tons of behind-the-scenes features or at least a full-length commentary.

So order it right now if you know anything about music!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0790729628|3.0|This is only one man's opinion of the quality of the DVD itself.  Be prepared for various video anomalies such as sudden and random brightness, changes and fuzziness of images and text.  A big disappointment.  In some ways better than VHS - in others worse.  A new and improved version of this DVD needs to be released for such a wonderful movie.  I was thinking it was my DVD player, but do a search on Google and you'll see many people have noticed strange things related to the quality of this product.<br />Barely any extras at all (almost none).   What a shame.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I had heard many good things about this release and I'd been catching snippets of cuts like &quot;Jesus,Etc.&quot; and &quot;War on War&quot;, but this really was just a teasing for the sonic  experience that YHF truly is! This release will go down as a watermark effort as Jeff Tweedy &amp; Co. are liberated from convention and inspired beyond belief. &quot;Ashes..&quot; and &quot;Poor Places&quot; are especially poignant and rewarding. The Grammys committee will probably be too intimidated to touch this, but YHF should be recognised as the year's most gifted effort and the finest offering yet delivered in this new millennium.
B000075BFK|4.0|Two thoughts.  First of all this CD is pretty good.  Even though it isn't on the same level as the CDs released while he was alive (including Makaveli), it is better than most of the garbage that is out now (Ja Rule, Nelly, etc.).  My second thought is that the editorial reviewer needs to check his facts, because Suge Knight had almost nothing to do with this album.  Yeah, his name is on it, but Nas was on because of Afeni Shakur, not because of Suge.  This accoustic song is the best song on the album, and Nas doesn't ruin it.  You mention Johnny J, but Johnny J also has no real relationship with Suge anymore.  He hated him enough that he edited \\"Death Row\\" off of the last album, remember?<br />Buy the CD, some of the remixes are worse then the bootlegs but some are also better.  Just be thankful we still have music coming from the real greatest of all time.
0151008116|2.0|I was very suprised by how underwhelmed I was by this novel.  I like books with religious or spiritual themes/motifs, and the first 20 percent of the novel was compelling.  However, once the &quot;action&quot; starts, it goes downhill.  The novel is more of an exercise based on the situation (not even the author's own creation).<br />Skip this one and real something with power, like Saramango's Blindness.
B000079B0A|5.0|This is a new version of Kylie Minogue's smash album FEVER. It features the same 12 tracks from the original CD, with a bonus CD with rare songs and remixes. FEVER is a strong album of dance songs. It opens with &quot;More More More&quot;, an addictive dance number. Then is the smash single &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;, which is one of my favorite on the set. &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; was a smash single all around the world with its addictive chorus. &quot;Fever&quot; is my favorite song on the album, it has an addictive beat, it should have been a single. &quot;Fragile&quot; is the closest thing to a ballad on the album, its another highlight. Other highlights include &quot;Give It To Me&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot;, and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;.<br />The bonus CD includes &quot;Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head&quot;, which has become its own classic. The &quot;Come Into My World&quot; (Fischerspooner Mix) betters the original, its worth the price alone just for this remix. I also enjoy the Ruff &amp; Jam US Radio Mix of &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;. There's also a dub mix of &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, as well as a rare track titled &quot;Whenever You Feel Like It&quot;. Overall its worth the price for the bonus CD, especially if you are a hardcore fan and enjoys Kylie's remixes.
B00004W221|3.0|This 1993 gem is only the second film to be shot on the Notre Dame campus (following Knute Rockne: All-American) and it follows Rudy's struggle to overcome dozens of obstacles and realize his abbreviated dream of playing for the Fighting Irish football team.  The plot and dramatic music can get schmaltzy at times, but the campus shots are beautiful and captures a bit of the Notre Dame mystique visitors and alumns claim to feel when walking under the Golden Dome.  Rudy is persistent in his struggle, and Sean Astin masterfully plays him so he remains sympathetic without becoming annoying.  Look for appearances by former Notre Dame president Fr. Ted Hesburgh, a young Vince Vaughan and Lili Taylor and a great big Jon Favreau as Rudy's pal.  The football game scenes during the film's climax capture a bit of the gameday atmosphere in South Bend; more importantly, they capture Rudy's focus and realization that he has reached his life's goal.  I was disappointed in the selection of extras included on the disc.  I enjoyed the impressive mini documentary interview with the real Rudy Ruettiger (which debunked some of the critiques I heard comparing the film with the real story), but I was disappointed that scenes of the film's premiere in South Bend were left off (they were included on some \\"Special Editions\\" of the VHS tape).  Second, where was the trailer for the film?  I can't believe that the disc's producers included irrelevant trailers for \\"Brian's Song\\" & \\"Jerry Maguire\\" (the only connection I can see here is that they also deal with football and redemption, but that's it) and left off the \\"Rudy\\" trailers.  Perhaps in 2003 the producers will release a 10-year anniversary edition of the DVD and correct some of these omissions and unnecessary additions.
0385503954|1.0|What a frustrating, pretentious book!  McEwan puts together a nineteenth century novel and then \\"cleverly\\" refuses to end it, because the godlike author/narrator is unable to do so.  A tired concept and a rip-off.  Nothing Pirandello didn't do a whole lot better a long time ago.
0887307280|5.0|Was recommended this book by a multi-millionaire (Brad Sugars). Bought the book & started reading. Initially it annoyed me because he's so good at explaining why your small business ISN'T working. I was amazed at the whole concept of the book. It really does give great ideas for you to apply immediately to your business. I envy those who read this book before starting their business. I keep picking it up to review the ideas given. This book is a MUST read.
B000069AUI|5.0|I am bankrupting myself on media products in general but most especially on my newest vice, special interest magazines from the UK... But, boy, they sure do have some great magazines on art, film, music and computers. Thankfully, \\"Q\\" (the music one), included a CD this time out and there was a number on it that literally took my breath away (or should I say made the blood rush to my head?). It was \\"Amsterdam\\" by Coldplay on \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" Well, I just had to have it after that and the album as a whole lives up to \\"Amsterdam\\" very well. \\"In My Place\\" and \\"Clocks\\" are also 5 star numbers. Everything else is at least a 4 star number. Then I tackled Coldplay's earlier album, \\"Parachutes,\\" and came up with no fewer than six 5 star numbers on that album! \\"Q\\" also tipped me off to \\"Radiohead\\" which I like as well as \\"Coldplay.\\" In fact, I'm almost afraid to buy \\"Q\\"'s next issue for fear I might go off the deep end again in musical discovery. There is a quality that Coldplay has in its music that I've not heard in rock before. It is rock and yet its not. There is an \\"away\\" quality to it that is just not present in earlier rock music that gives it a very haunting and ethereal quality. The fact that the lead vocalist's voice is gorgeous doesn't hurt either.
B00006G8G1|1.0|I think Steve Harris has a.d.d. This DVD has about 200 cuts a song. In the first song, \\"Wicker Man\\" first they show Dickson singing, then the fans. Then Nicko then back to Dickinson then to Harris then over to Gerrs, then back to the fans, back to Harris, then back to Dickinson who jumps off part of the stage, then right in the middle of the jump back to Nicko, then the fans in all of fifteen seconds, during \\"Brave New World\\" Gerrs is doing a solo yet the camera is all over the place BUT NOT ON HIM!!!. Also the sound is great however I think Dickinson was TOO SPOT-ON with his vocals.  The band should be ashamed to release this. I tried to watch this twice and I got a headache both times. Then there's the fact that it's a two disc set and the second disc is truly worthless it's \\"Rock in Rio\\" not \\"Talk in Rio\\" Also the packaging of this set is basically a piece of cardboard which could scratch both discs. I though maiden cared about their fans but I guess they don't, this set shows maiden is just trying to milk money from their fans with really a really bad product.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Don't be discouraged by the fact that this is an animated movie! I was skeptical at first, to say the least, when my friends told me how funny this movie was... \\"It's aimed at 5 year olds\\" was my inital thought!! BUT after sitting down to watch this, it has become one of my favourite movies!! <br />Eddie Murphy almost steals the spotlight in his highly entertaining voice of the donkey and Mike Myers does an equally good job of Shrek, an ogre, the main character of the film. The humour in this movie provides so many laughs and some of the jokes couldn't possibly have been aimed at children as they are often very mature and subtle!! The animation is fantastic and the cameos from favourite nursery rhymes/children's stories make the movie even more interesting for children!!<br />The music featured in the film is also a highlight!! It has a wonderful musical repertoire of remakes of old songs as well as brand new ones including \\"I'm a Believer\\" by Smash Mouth... the music in this movie will have you up dancing and to have it sung and performed by animated characters will bring laugter all around!<br />All up, this movie offers great animation of loveable characters, entertainment for both the kids and adults, catchy music that will have you dancing and humour that will being tears to your eyes. What more could you possibly need? ;)
B00005JL78|2.0|I really wanted to like this film.  I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, and Spielberg has been on shakey futuistic ground(AI, anyone?).  But I have to give them points for trying.  However, for a movie that focuses on being a big thinker, there are so many plot holes in this one that I was taken completely out of the film and just sat there wondering how the hell each one got by Spielberg, who, if nothing else, knows how to craft a story well.<br />Cruise plays John Anderton, the head of the DC Department of Pre-Crime.  In the future, you see, murders can be predicted ahead of time by three psychics called \\"pre-cogs\\", that visualize them and give their visualizations to the pre-crime cops, who stop a murder before it happens.  In the film's one spectacular scene, the opening, Cruise and his team race against the clock to stop a cukoled husband from killing his wife and her lover.  It's a nail-biter, and the movie may be worth a view based on that, but that's it.<br />The system is unique to DC, but a national referrendum on a nationwide pre-crime system is up on the ballots, and Cruise and his mentor, played by the always excellent Max Von Sydow, want nothing more than to see it pass.  Howeever a Dept. of Justice official, Colin Farrell, is looking into the system to see if it's as perfect as it says.  This is where things go bad for Cruise.  You see, there are these little wooden balls that have the names of who is going to commit a murder inscribed into them.  One color if the murder is unpremeditated, one if it's premeditated.  A premeditated ball comes down with Cruise's name on it, and he, of course, runs, trying to find out who is framing him and trying to save the system he built at the same time.<br />This is the story, and it's a good idea.  The problem lies in the plot, and it's many gaping holes.  Any time-related film will have them, but a director as good as Spielberg should have realized how blatant they are.  For example, we are told that the Pre-Cogs who see the murders are genetic mutations, accidents.  And they can only see in the area around DC.  How then, will the program go National?  There is no explination as to where the other Pre-Cogs will come from.  Secondly, for a man wanted by the law, Cruise gets in and out of Pre-Crime HQ pretty easily, using his own eyeball.  He had to have it removed to avoid the optical scanners that are everywhere(More on that in a moment).  Still, wouldn't his security clearance be voided by the fact he is a wanted man?  Finally, there is the circumstances of the murder that Cruise is supposed to commit.  He says he's never met the man, and logically he shouldn't go looking for him, right?  Avoid the man and you avoid the crime?  Well, he goes looking for him, and what happens throws everything else we know about the Pre-Cogs, their visions, and teh little wooden balls into a blender and destroys the logic of the film.  There are many, MANY more plot holes.  A drinking game could be devised around them.<br />The final act is a paint by numbers game that any intelligent person would have seen coming, and again Spielberg avoids the big risks for his patented uplifting ending.<br />As for the films Big Ideas-They are payed lip service to, but never really discussed or addressed.  Privacy is a big issue, and it is mentioned, but nothing of substance is ever discussed about them.  It's as if Spielberg thought that by mentioning privacy issues, his film could address them.  But no discussion is made.  Also, what of the Pre-Cogs?  These are Human Beings kept in a tank, with no concern for their lives.  Ethical standards exist in medicine, and since the government of this future doesn't appear to be Big Brother, why would the medical community allow these poor souls to be trapped?  Finally, what about the people arrested for crimes they didn't commit?  No judgement is made on them, or any comment on their fates.  How long are they kept locked up?  Are sentences any different in different cases?  How does the Constitution, still in place in this future, allow for this kind of punishment?  Since it's not national law, wouldn't the Supreme Court say something?  A thinking person comes away from this film with more questions than answers, and that is a shame.  The movie doesn't develop it's world enough to give you any insight on the way it works.  Sometimes, more questions than answers is a good thing, especially in Science Fiction.  But this film fails to even address the questions that it's makers claim it raised.  It is a noble effort, but much more attention should have been payed to plot development, and the ending should have been riskier.  I really wish Spielberg would stop playing it safe.  If you've heard what the last line of the film was supposed to be, you know that my review would be more favorable if it had been included.  As it is, the film dissapoints.  Spielberg needs to morph out of Kubrick mode.  It doesn't suit him.nt cases?  How does the Constitution, still in place in this future, allow for this kind of punishment?

B00006WUWP|5.0|I found Goldmember to be absolutely hilarious, and funnier than the previous 2 movies put together!! Mike Myers does a wonderful job as 4 different characters including Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard and the new addition - Goldmember. <br />Beyonce Knowles did an OK job in her first movie role but the lack of on-screen chemistry between Foxxy Cleopatra and Austin Powers was disappointing. However, this was made up for by the laugh-a-minute humour that brought tears to my eyes! Fat Bastard was successfully reintroduced in his funniest scene ever and I saw some of the most hilarious, original humour that was far superior to that found in the first two installments of Austin Powers. <br />The cameos in the opening credits were fantastic and especially entertaining and while the ending was a slight let-down, the jokes were A grade and the visual humour was outstanding. <br />I would recommend this movie to any Austin Powers fan and even if you didn't particularly like the first two movies, you should see this one! My best friend was dead-set against Austin Powers but laughed herself stupid after seeing this! Recommended for all, 5 stars!!
B00005JKZ3|1.0|\\"MIB II\\" was the WORST film of 2002, hands down.  \\"Kung Pow: Enter the Fist\\" had more laughs.  The actors walk through their roles and there is no joy in the film, which is sad considering how entertaining and original the first film was.  There are no memorable lines, scenes, or jokes.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are just in it for the paycheck.  Barry Sonnenfeld proves once again that his theory that shorter movies are better is pathetically flawed.  This film is witless, hopeless, pointless.  Plot?  What plot?  Visual effects?  We recycled the first ones?  And what happened to MIB headquarters?  It used to be brimming with life.  Now, it's a corporate mess.  The movie rivals the Austin Powers and Bond films for shameless plugs.  I would write a more coherent review, but there's nothing TO review.  Do not rent, do not buy, do not view if you wish to keep your dignity intact.  Lord knows I gave up mine when I payed 6 bucks to see this.

0792837614|5.0|&quot;West Side Story&quot; is a true broadway classic.  It is based on Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, but it is set in downtown New York. The film is directed by Robert Wise and it features memorable songs such as: &quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Somewhere&quot;, and &quot;America&quot;.  The film also won an Oscar for 'Best Picture' in 1961.
0553288105|3.0|(there may be spoilers in my review... so don't read on if you wanna figure things out for yourself.)<br />I got this one as part of the 'Masterpieces of Science Fiction' series from Easton Press. Which means it's supposed to be worthy of hardbound leather with gold edges, sewn-in pages,  and a built-in bookmark. I would have rather bought the paperback for a few bucks than spend $ on the version I got.<br />PROS: <br />-Totally interesting science and pseudo-science. I actually understand more about atoms having read this book. I even understand how the fictional atom that is supposed to be impossible can be made to seem possible. Working it into a story was probably the best achievment of the book. Very well done. <br />- I thought the beginning chapter was the best. It pumped things up enough to make me want to read more.<br />- The alien race was interesting. I think what Asimov was doing was parallelling the 3 different parts of the atom with the 3 different alien sexes. Kinda reminded me of the description of the atom on WKRP where they used different street gangs...\\"Pros\\", \\"New Boys\\", and \\"Elected Ones\\" as I recall. It especially makes sense since the \\"Emotionals\\" move around a lot on the surface of the planet, and the \\"Parentals\\" and \\"Rationals\\" stay mostly underground. I also think Azimov was paralleling the electron pump, proton pump, and the need for energy in the way he describes the 3 sexes (in a minimal way). I could be wrong about this, but that's my take on it. Very cool if it's true.<br />- life on the moon was interesting as well. Made a lot of sense.<br />CONS:<br />- I thought the beginning was a good hook. The middle was ok and had a decent cliffhanger. But the ending fizzled. There was absolutely no climax. It's like the book went in reverse. The beginning was more exciting than the end. When I was done, I felt let down.<br />- The big 'surprise' or 'twist' at the end of the second part was absolutely no surprise to me. I figured it out about halfway through. Maybe there were too many clues.  Maybe it was just too obvious.  Maybe I'm really really smart... and stuff. I don't know.<br />All-in-all, I wouldn't strongly recommend this book. I have no idea why it won an award. There are some scientific things that are very cool and are nicely told through the craft of storytelling, but the story itself was a let-down in the end. It's almost like Azimov found a girlfriend around the time he was writing the third part and he got mushy (or tired)... forgetting about the epic problem he had presented to the reader. <br />This book might be worth what a paperback costs, but no more than that. If you know someone who has it, borrow it. Or maybe check it out of a library. Definitely DO NOT get a copy from Easton Press.
0066620996|3.0|I agree with the last reviewer (copykat). I too question the validity of discussing past practices rather than current trends. What Jim Collins describes is the softer side of business leadership, but gives me no advice on how companies can put new business processes into practice. Remember Hammer and Champy's Reengineering the Corporation from the 90s, well I've just read CSC's new one, Business Process Management The Third Wave. Way cool. My advice - read Jim Collins to find out what to do, read bpm3.com to find out how to do it.
0880389052|5.0|The best part about this book is that it 'moves'. The author keeps the pace up and describes what is important to know. As a result, you'll breeze through this book.<br />Not to say it doesn't have any details... it has plenty.  But everythin is written 'solidly'.  That's the only word I can think of to describe it.<br />I haven't read any of the other Drizzt books yet.  This is my first one. So far so good. <br />On to &quot;EXILE&quot;.
0151008116|5.0|I avoided reading this book because of the implausible premise. A good friend kept tellng me, \\"Read it, read it,\\" and finally, reluctantly, I did. And I couldn't put it down.<BR>I laughed like the hyena who plays a pivotal role early in the book. I bought into the outrageous setup. I don't give a fig for the religious message that others argue about. I found the book, the story, and the moral thoroughly engaging and 'believable,' at least in a metaphorical sense. Lay aside your reservations, and read this one. It's great.
0743201140|5.0|I really enjoyed Strengths and have recommended it countless times. Of course, access to the web site (through a code nu,ber hidden inside the book's jacket)and development of my own personal strength profile have helped me to transform this book into a genuinely practical, enduring experience. I highly recommend this book.

B000069AUI|5.0|All I have to say is that I love this cd!  I heard the song &quot;In My Place&quot; on the radio (and liked it)  and after hearing that the rest of this cd was good, I decided to buy it myself.  I'm really glad i did!!  i love the song &quot;Clocks&quot;  and just the entire cd.  Definately worth buying!
B000069AUI|5.0|Everyone has their own opinion of excellent music. I know for me i admire music with powerful lyrics and wonderful rhythms. Coldplay's first album Parachutes ~ did just that, yet they took things a step further with A rush of blood to the head. This album seems to have the same \\"natural organic\\" feeling as Parachuts leaving the audience with that \\"did we hear this before feeling????\\" <BR>\\"Green eyes\\" seems to have a pure folk rock feeling as voice overutures carry over the silence of an acoustic guitar. Overall this album is possibly the best one i have heard in this genre this year. An excellent album with a majority of feeling throughout. 5 stars<BR>my-$0.2
0151008116|5.0|In May of 2001, I chaperoned an overnight science field trip for my eighth grade students. The majority voted for a nighttime activity that I anticapted: watching the final, and climatic, episode of \\"Survivor.\\" Had Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" been published then, the television would have remained off and I would have spent the night reading aloud this excellent story of survival that I hope will find its way into schools and homes across America.<br />Piscine Molitor Patel, popularly known as \\"Pi,\\" is the younger of two sons born to an Indian zookeeper and his wife in the former French colonial outpost of Pondicherry, India. For 16 year-old Pi, life in the zoo, \\"was a paradise on earth.\\" But, he says, \\"People move . . . in hope of a better life.\\" Thus begins a perilous journey across the Pacific lasting 227 days. Orphaned by a shipwreck, Pi finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with some supplies and among other animals, a 450-pound Bengal tiger laughably named Richard Parker. Pi understands that death is never far away; he could die from hunger, thirst, or be eaten by the tiger. Pi's struggle to stay afloat, assuage his hunger and keep the tiger at bay mean that though his activities of daily living are quite regimented, he must rely heavily on his knowledge of animals and his own resourcefulness to survive. It is a challenge with dire consequences. <br />The beauty \\"Life of Pi\\" is that anyone might assume a story about being stranded in a life boat to be one-dimensional drudgery: fear not for it has many layers and always remains, above all else, a great story. Pi's narrative voice is as soft and light as Martel's prose. As a character, Pi never changes. He remains delightfully polite, amazingly industrious, genuinely honest, and affectionately vulnerable throughout the story; rather it is the circumstances that develop and change. Equal parts bildungsroman and rite of passage, there are some hysterical scenes describing the multiplicity of Pi's faith as well some heartbreaking scenes describing the onset of hallucinations related to dehydration and blindness.<br />Martel stands out as a writer for several reasons. He resists the very strong temptation to anthropomorphize (or Disney-ize) the animals in this story. He doesn't rely on sex to propel the story. Most importantly, there is no gratuitous violence in this book. Nothing more graphic than what any reader might have seen \\"Wild Kingdom\\" or the \\"Discovery Channel\\" takes place. Alas, the book ends on an odd but very interesting note. In fact, I found the ending so thought compelling that I picked up the book several times to reread it.<br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is a wonderful story that doesn't rely on sentimentality to warm your heart. I highly recommend this excellent and unpredictable story full of deep faith, wild animals, and delightful surprises.

0316666343|5.0|Wow- I loved this book. I thought it was truly amazing- and I disagree with a lot of the reviews that others have posted. I read this in the airport and on a plane and was completely lost in it.  I was actually crying. I loved Susie and her family. I actually didn't think it ended too happily- there seemed to be a lot wrong with everyone.... I'd say judge for yourself- a must read.

0066214122|4.0|An imaginative leap in Crichton's work. After reading Jurrasic Park, I became a dedicated fan of his work. This book, although confusing at times, show's how dedicated he is to providing accurate information in his science-fiction novels.<BR>With an origional storyline,it's nonstop action after passing the rather dragged out beggining. At times it can be hard to follow (mostly when a discussion of nano-technology is happening), but altogether it is a well thought out and well written book.<BR>I would definently recomend you purchase it.
