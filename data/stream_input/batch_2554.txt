B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is one hell of a super spy. Great story, good flow of action and the kind of outcome I like to see in this world of espionage but seldom do.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is one of the better game apps out there. some of the best graphics and game play for free.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is a great time waster.  sat and played for 3 hours on a train at one point. would recommend it
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great strategy game. This game is great I'd you have some time to kill or just need to exercise your mind. Surprisingly, it's a great brain workout, killing the entire human race.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Tatiana Maslany is truly amazing. She takes an excellent story to whole other level. The story starts off strong and has more twists and turns than a mountain road. This is what scifi should be. Take a simple scientific premise and say \\"What if...\\" and discover all the subtle and not so subtle permutations it produces. I never knew what was coming and that is very rare on TV. I can't wait until next season.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|They filmed this in my hometown and did a great job! Very friendly people and crew! The show is AMAZING!! Totally hooked, watched all 3 seasons in one week!! Good Job!! Please don't kill off Daryl!! :)
B001RNO7BW|5.0|Awesome shoe. The sole is robust has some weight to it but would not consider it heavy. Overall the shoe is put together very well and will last a long time. The leather is soft but still rugged and will hold up. These are the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn and is casual and functional for hiking and walking in the rain.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I adore Toy Story and Toy Story 2 lives up to the original story. Love Pixar movies overall. This one is adorable and touching as well.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Saw the movie then read the book.  Both were great but if your imagination is lacking and you want to read the book, I advise watching the movie first.  It helps you grasp the visual in your head.  By the way, the movie was outstanding.  Be in the right frame of mind as it can be slow at some points.  So if you are sleepy you will miss the beauty of this movie.  Open your mind to the fantasy that very well could be a reality!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|\\"With my palm to the two-way mirror, I pushed back, my head pillowed on his shoulder. He wrapped my throat with his hand, gripped my hip, and thrust so hard into me that my feet left the floor.\\"<br /><br />Ok, honestly, that scene is one of the best sex scene's I have ever read EVER! It's hot, intense, powerful, raw...WOW! That just proves right there how much Gideon Cross is HOT!<br /><br />When I started reading this book, I forgot how much I loved Gideon..ok...maybe I didn't but I did forget the dirty things he says. Wow. Can we say *swoon*?? The things he says to Eva...wow...it made me blush and that's saying something.<br /><br />Sylvia Day definitely has a way with words. The way she writes, it's like you're actually there, seeing everything that's taking place. This book has the best sex scene's out of the series so far and trust me, that's not why I loved the book but it's one of the reasons. Lol!<br /><br />Through this book, you learn more about Gideon and Eva's past and their intense love for each other grows and grows. It's just...wow...I can't wait for the next book. This series is definitely a favorite of mine!<br /><br />Wonderful job Sylvia Day!!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Out of the question. I wish I had at least one ounce of his courage, though. I had a stroke recently and was temporarily paralyses on my left side. Could not last 30 years. Helen Hunt deserved the nomination. Great story.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Read this on holidays it was a great read but a little predictable and the ending a little far fetched
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love using Pinterest. This app makes it easier to keep up with all the things you want to keep track of...on the go and at home. YAY!
B00886XQO0|5.0|This is the best pair headphones I have ever had. I highly recommend these to anyone who loves gaming and music.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Love it so sad it's over<br />Loved the whole entire series of books....very easy read and keeps your attention, keep  you wanting more
193700788X|5.0|Perfect ending to Sookie's adventures. She is happy with her life and that's what matters! I would recommend this series to anyone!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Having been teenagers in the 70's, this made for a very enjoyable and in depth look for us.  How amazing that they have remained such icons.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This was a awesome app. This is so cool. I recommend it from ages 6-40. You will love this app. Their are 100 o
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! It picks up right where Reflected In You lefft off. There were some unexpected twist and turns and it's every bit as fantastic as the other books in the series. It was worth the wait and I'm looking forward to continuing Gideon and Evan's story. If you aren't a fan of a steamy, thrilling, deepening love story then definitely steer clear.  However if you are a fan of the Crossfire series you won't be disappointed.  Don't miss out on this and don't be discouraged from getting this because of some of the more negative reviews.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This Book Was Everything I Was Hoping It Would Be! I Love The Characters And The Book Itself Was Just Great. I'll Enjoy Rereading All Three Books. I Recommend Them! :)
B004FQX5CK|5.0|Purchased Blade Runner (Blu-ray) for a good price. How could this have been a poor buying experience? It's Blade Runner formatted in Blu-ray at a pretty awesome price. Seller met my needs and man it got here so fast I had too hit it with the fire extinguisher because it was on fire. #winkyface
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wish it was 0.7.0 was out but I love the game ME and my friends always play it is a boss
B0058VW36U|5.0|I loved this game from first time I have seen this game. I bought it and loved it so much you should get this excellent game.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This can is challenging but fun. All you have to do is connect all the monsters together so they can escape the kitchen . I hope you'll enjoy like me .
B00992CF6W|4.0|It will never upload and the controls keep freezing and it is making me mad it also will not let my brother use the water buckets on his ipod
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever I have 255 diamonds and full diamond amor yea that's right full diamond amor and a diamond block HOUSE!!!!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Probably one of the most amazing stories I have ever read. It makes me think of my own amazing and at times challenging group of people I call \\"family\\".
B0085YOD1A|2.0|This app tells so much at a glance especially when I,m playing the games. I think everyone would want this on there device
B009A87X80|5.0|Love Eva Cassidy!  These songs that she recorded before her passing......way too soon.....they are all favorites and I listen to them on this cd a lot.  I pray she has found her rainbow wherever she is.  Thank you!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book was a whole bunch of nothing. No real drama. Disappointing! I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I enjoy playing, but wish there was a way to earn more pearls or algee without spending real money. Why can you exchange pearls fir sand dollars but not the other way around. Also, you need a WiFi connection to play. This doesn't make it a very portable game.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|wonderful cd
B00A3IKTJG|2.0|Sorry, I read 20% of it and just could not get into it.  I did not finish it.  Wasn't worth my time.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Worth the time and the monies especially if you are a Tom Cruise fan, he and the rest of the cast did a great job.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use it not just to capture my phone camera pics but as my personal folders on my work computer. This way everything on my work pc that is mine stays with me. And I share a folder with my wife and dad, so easy!
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|Gary Moore was Irish, not British. He spent his early days playing in Belfast & Dublin. He played and recorded with Skid Row & Thin Lizzy.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|You learn so much from this dramatization thanks to Andrew Chaikin's exhaustive research. I suggest you get his book, &#34;A Man On The Moon&#34;, after you watch this. This is a must have for all space aficionados.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|If you dont have this, you should get it. It has realistic gameplay and it`s educational. Those pictures on front aren`t lying. It`s a great game
B0094K1MH2|4.0|We enjoyed this movie and our grandsons (4, 6,. 8) certainly did. There were some aspects to the plot that were a bit tedious, but overall it was enjoyable.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Horrible, where is the conclusion we all waited 8 or more months to read the conclusion.....the end of you Silvia Day I will never buy one of your books again...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is AMAZING!!! It's great for any age that's interested in caring for horse's. It's also very fun to play
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I found the intersecting plot lines to be very well-done, and enjoyed each story within the movie.  My only complaint relates to the futuristic/regressive story that comprises a large portion of the movie; the dialect created for the characters is fine, but Halle Berry and Tom Hanks mumble so much that almost everything they say is incomprehensible.  Surely actors can enunciate while still coming across as \\"real\\".
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It is so awesome it shows what % you have left.  And it gives extra information about you battery that you probably dint know. Again this is a good app you should get it. IT IS AWESOME
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I'm not sure how the Jack Frost idea is going to fare on more tropical latitudes, where most people don't know what snow or even frost is, but the overall story of bad and evil battling for children's dreams was captivating. I highly recommend for families with kids 4 and older (as long as they believe in Santa, Easter Bunny, and Tooth Fairy at least a little bit).
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Ten time better than the movie. Just a great book that you will find yourself reading over and over again.
B001O1O71C|3.0|The author attempted something grand and wound up with something moderate but worth reading. I am sympathetic toward the characters in th  end but only somewhat so.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles are great along with the package downloads the only thing that would make it better is a lighter background dark pieces are hard to distinguish because background is so dark other than that everything runs smooth
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book drew me in only to be completely underwhelming in its conclusion. A five-year-old's nonsensical drivel would have been more entertaining to read.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|As always Sylvia never disappoints. Loved this side of Gideon we haven't seen. I can see the reasons for the longer series as their backstory is a difficult subject that needs to be explored. Angel and Ace's journey needs time. Loved it.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Very interesting read. 17 more words required. I ate apples as a child because they were nutritious and not bad.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|This is a fantastic compilation of Queens music anthology highly recommend this over other options. Opp Opp Opp Oppa Gangdum Style
B0090KZDSK|5.0|couldn't put it down, like the previous two.<br />Seems like it will continue, at least I hope so and can't wait for next book.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Well like most I am dissapointed with the ending.  I did somewaht enjoy the changes in the characters.  This book seemed to have a lot of \\"filler\\" type description in it almost like Ms. Day wanted to just fill pages then an adrupt cut off.  I expected better giving the push backs on the realease date.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|This was not enough of a story to warrant the almost $10 cost. Storyline was a revolving door that lead nowhere and then a non-ending. To call this a trilogy, then push back the release and announce it will really be five books total is greedy and unfair. $50 could be better spent somewhere else for sure. No more Sylvia Day for me.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|The story was predictable but me and my wife still enjoyed it, there is a nice twist and surprise thrown in so for us anyway it was a good movie.
B00846TRHY|5.0|I saw this movie on a Virgin America flight and knew I had to buy it. This is such an amazing story and is more true to what was happening in the Sudan, much more than the &#34;Kony 2012&#34; campaign.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Tom does a great job in this movie.  He has matured well as an actor.  Lots of action and suspense.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Love Gillian Flynn!  The ending is never quite what I think it is going to be.  On to the next Gillian Flynn book!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The final book of this trilogy I'd dark and depressing.  As a series billed as young adult fiction, I feel that there is too much disturbing violence and a very grim view of a future society.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Who wouldn't LOVE &#34;Tootsie!&#34; It's a movie filled with great humor, the human condition of HOPE, the promise of a better tomorrow and down right FUNNY!! I love it!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I can and DO listen to these songs over and over and never get tired of it!!!  LOVE LOVE IT!!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great picture which streamed nicely. The movie it's self was also quite good and my daughter was able to watch it the next day. Good job Amazon.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have read the first two books about Gideon and Eva and really loved the books.  So I have been waiting for what seems like forever for Entwined with You to finally come out and was really disappointed.  For those who love to read the \\"steamy sex scenes\\" this book will not disappoint, but what I really liked about these books in the past was the story line and how it held you so you couldn't put the book down.  This book was more about sex and not enough substance.  Really disappointed.  I won't be signing up in advance to buy the next book, which is really disappointing because I liked this story line and Sylvia Day's writing better than James's Grey books.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Royal Envoy is a fun little town-building game with a whimsical story, good animation, and challenging quests. BEST OF ALL, the app doesn't constantly try to sell you more things just to play the game.  After you pay the nominal fee, you can play all the way through to the end without having to buy anything else at all.  Way to go Playrix!  Make more of these please.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Wonderful songs on this CD!!! Phillip Phillips has such a great voice to listen to! Love the song &#34;Hold On&#34;!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this app it realy helps out and since I have a kindle its hard yo tell when its fully charged
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After reading the reviews I was expecting to be disappointed but I am pleased to say I really enjoyed this book.I think she really set the next book up. Although I can't say I am happy to spend this much money two more times.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing and encouraging story about true Americans who give their all for our country. Very insightful and well written. Humbly written by someone just wanting to speak the truth about life and war.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|the book was more fluff than fun....from someone who LOVES sex....it got sickening.  find a PLOT, for goodness sake, and work with it.  everyone is ALL over the place.  Eve becomes a sexual BITCH.  Who care about EVERYTHING that's going on with EVERYBODY.  And I'm guessing that it will be a year before we see the next book, judging on your other reviews.  I just read the first 2 books a few months ago. you are such a disappointment, Sylvia Day, and I am a HUGE fan of the Grey books and the POV of Christian Grey.  Write a book about Gideon and Eva..not about 8 other people.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|My rating is an average one, and it is based on getting this app for free.  Why the average rating?  Because there isn't really anything \\"pro\\" about it (it has few features).  Plus, I find it annoying that the percent charge remaining value which resides in the upper left corner (taskbar?) cannot be turned off.
B00992CF6W|4.0|great game glitches that are usually in your favor awesome creative mode amazing graghics amazing game you will love it a lot and awesome updates.
6305508550|5.0|An absolutely hilarious movie that everyone should watch. I think all of us have been in this situation at one point or another working in an office in a tiny cubicle.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Forest Gump is the greatest movie ever made. Having it at my disposal online is a nice addition to my collection.
B00B89WXYS|4.0|I need to give it time, but I believe it is growing on me.....it's not a &#34;secrets&#34; CD as of yet, but has great potential!
B004KSQN7C|4.0|This cd is pretty good, I like most of the songs. It's alot more upbeat then some of her albums.
B009I2UH2W|3.0|It hasn't appeared to last as long as I anticipated or maybe it's a fuse I've blown....I don't know but I know it isn't working right now so I'm at a cross T on this product.
1451613512|5.0|Stone picks up where Howard Zinn left off. A thought provoking analysis of American &#34;exceptionalism&#34; and the building of an empire. This book should be taught in every American university. Unfortunately it isn't which is exactly why we continue to make the same mistakes over and over again in domestic policies and geo-politics. A must read for anyone who hasn't drunk the Kool-aid.
B004J09ONG|5.0|My 6 y/o daughter and I love this movie. She asks to watch it often.I always cry but it has a wonderful ending.Any animal lover would love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its really fun and kinds stupid like you have to buy the other games and whateves but dis whit is good.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun game keeps you busy once you get started very colorful.<br />Pleasing sounds good for children 6 and over. Would recommend this app.<br />Memo is a fun fish
0307341577|4.0|I bought this book because I saw a photo of someone reading it on the Underground New York Public Library website, and thought it sounded spooky. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The structure of the book is fascinating, with alternating chapters taking the story ahead on parallel tracks: the events of the day leading up to the massacre of the Day family, and the attempts 20+ years later by survivor Libby Day to establish the guilt or innocence of her brother Ben, who was jailed for the crime.<br /><br />The language is interesting too. Flynn creates hugely effective imagery and atmosphere, but she does so without resorting to big or unfamiliar words. There's plenty of dialogue in the book, with plenty of opportunities for tedious I said/he said/she said identifiers, but Flynn cleverly avoids this. Her technique reminds me of Chandler.<br /><br />As a European who has never visited the Midwest, I needed some help to get a feel of the landscape, but Flynn's evocations of place don't seem to be her biggest strength. So I spent an hour hopping around Kansas on Google StreetView to form an impression, and that definitely helped.<br /><br />The devil worship theme in the book, with its references to the moral panic of the mid-1980s, is adequately if not extensively explored. But the principal theme, which provides the swirling, murky undercurrent for the whole story, is money. Every salient character in the book is driven by the want of money, either as a creditor or debitor, or hand-to-mouth survivor. Gillian Flynn paints a powerful portrait of the dark place that poverty, in its acute or chronic form, can become for those it entraps.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000FC0V3E|1.0|This reads like a rough draft of notes for how the story plot should be organized. There's no emotion felt while reading it because there's no emotion put into it. If this hadn't been a quick read, I would have put it down. It's just lazy writing. Read Goodbye To Berlin by Christopher Isherwood if you're looking for similar subject matter by an actual good writer.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Wonderful book, I loved it, beginning to end! The book is so relatable to the average reader - just read it
B000FC0OOU|4.0|I felt Hemingway made this a bit more bloated than it should have been, but the story and the characters make up for the excess fat. It's truly an amazing story, as long as you know a thing or two about Spain, the Spanish Civil War, and also know Castilian Spanish (the literal English translations of Spanish in the dialog need to be translated back to the original Castilian Spanish to really make sense). I'm very glad that I did not try to read this in high school. Without the proper background, I feel that I would not have been able to truly appreciate the depth of the story.
B0068RHSCW|4.0|I hadn't heard of this movie before and I'm surprised that Daniel Craig was in a flop.  (I checked Wiki and this movie did not do well at all.)  Two big actors?  It's surprising.  Do NOT watch the trailer.  It contains a massive spoiler alert.<br /><br />This movie had me glued from start to finish.  I didn't know what was going to happen next.  Great plot! Great acting!  Great suspense!  I looked at the trailer at the end of the movie, prior to writing this review because a lot of people were saying not to look at the trailer.  It's true!  Don't look at the trailer prior to watching this movie.  That was lame that a big spoiler is in the trailer, and it would ruin it for anyone.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|Another great Album from Lady A!<br />They will win a CMA for this one I am sure of it! Would recommend!
B0009PVZW8|5.0|A great record, with one of the most beautiful packages i have ever seen. the box is just beautiful. As beautiful as the songs in the records. 45rpm vinyl, for amazing sound quality. Great deal.
1432794426|5.0|I start this review without words to express the research, hard work, dedication and truth that went into writing this book about our King of Kings Michael Jackson.<br />If you have not already read this book it's my advice to everyone who can get it even if it is from a library to read it and get the most accurate story you will find out there on Michael and who and what he was about. Karen Moriarty has put her heart and soul into this book and it is the best eye opener i have ever read concerning Michael and the praise he deserves that even to this day in his death he is still fighting for...Or should i say people like Karen and myself/his fans and friends along with his family are fighting till our last breath is drawn from this body we walk around in. I cant praise it enough so please take the time to pick it up and find out for yourself what you are missing out on. You can find it on Amazon.com and the title is \\"Defending a King his life & legacy\\" written by Karen Moriarty. link is below.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE FROM THE FIRST SCENE TO THE LAST, EVEN THE SOUND TRACK WAS ODDLY FUN. ALL OF THE ACTORS WERE ENGAGING AND ENTERTAINING, GREAT PACE, GREAT COSTUMES, AND JAIME WAS A GREAT ANTI-HERO, AND CHRISTOPH WALTZ, WHAT A TREASURE. I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH I BOUGHT IT.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book is so inspiring. I've seen the movie and what a flop the movie is as opposed to the book. This book will just brighten your day. Although I feel like there should be a second part to the book. I loved it.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|seth and babs make a great team in this movie, it was fun and it was original and it wasn't overdone. I just loved this movie!
B009DJB8I2|5.0|You get four discs, filled to the brim with great tracks from Portal 2 and some of Portal 1. I believe the content of the 4th disc isn't completely downloadable from the Portal site (or is on another page). Like game music? Like Portal? Buy it? Free TF item code (not sure for what, I didn't see anything in my inventory, but I never played TF2 on PC) and a Dota 2 Beta Key (admittedly, you can find them as easily as you used to be able to find broken AOL discs)
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|The plot was very thin, the action was fair, the characters weren't very developed, you didn't get to know them, so you didn't care for them. It looked like it was Arnolds' last movie, he wasn't even trying,maybe it's time he retires.
B00005JO5L|5.0|It was a great story. One day this DVD might be hard to find. It is worth hanging onto. I think some young star is going to do a documentary on it. It is nice to own the original DVD.
098555780X|5.0|Great product,  fast shipping,  always like Lenzen's books,  very informative and illustrations are great.  Will be buying the next book on knots he puts out.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Well-written book that sparked my interest in Tesla, someone I previously knew very little about.  I would recommend both the author and the book.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book had nothing new for probably 7/8 of the pages.  I give it 2 stars only because I love Gideon and Eva.  This was disappointing.
B000FA675C|5.0|I have read and re-read this book many times.  Religous controversy aside, this is a book that you won't want to put down.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|What did you expect me to say? Bruno's hot. His band is fabulous. What a voice, outdone only by his talent of playing multiple instruments....and he doesn't have to be rude to make a girl swoon....yeah, guys, step up for some lessons.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|The first two books in this series where phenomenal, the ending of this book was a huge disappointment.  It is worth reading to help finish out the series, but it could have ended with so much more resolved.
0151013047|5.0|A rare jewel of a book...so well written...so much so, that I worry about seeing the movie...I can't imagine how they could capture the anguish and the joy, the suspense and finality of it all....
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a great and and heart- touching memoir to read. I would recommend this to high school students, but anyone can read it(:
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'll start by saying that this book barely makes 3 stars for me, and I'm not giving the rating because of the crappy ending.<br />HOWEVER, I cannot even describe how upset I am, like everyone else, that I bought this book under the impression that it was the END.<br />The story line seemed like filler.  I love Gideon, I'm starting to hate Eva, and I don't understand why some of the things in this book were even necessary, it just seemed like she was trying to stretch it out intentionally. (during the first 2 books I told a friend \\"I like Eva much better than Ana - she's not such a whiney baby\\" but now I almost HATE her)<br />Had I started the book KNOWING that it wasn't the last one, maybe I wouldn't be so dissapointed, BUT even if I had known I'd still hate the end.  It's so ABRUPT.  It just STOPS all of a sudden, it's so odd.
B0051ZH9AS|5.0|Ella  Fitzgerald  was is and always will  be the FIRST  LADY  OF SONG!!  She is simply divine.  I was so thrilled  to  add  this to my growing  collection of Ella CD's!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I fell in love with Drew within a few minutes of reading the book....Kate was very lucky to have someone like Drew prove his love to her...
B00BEXB18M|1.0|At least drugs helped u make killer albums I Love God too but damn he doesn't want u to make your music for the sellout crowd this from the same Christian that gave us endgame c'mon Dave prove us wrong !!! This album doesn't cut it for me Black Sabbath's new album is going to blow this pop rock crap away!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Really..another book! The story lacked depth and no additional character development. My expectations were set high with the first two books. I could really careless where the story line goes from here got what I need from the first three books. No need to read the fourth or the fifth.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I hope the movie does it justice. Great piece of fiction to feed the zombie thrill alive in America today.
193418070X|4.0|I listened to the audio book of Graceling. I bought the book for my kindle but had not read it yet. I loved the story of Katsa and Po, such an endearing love story. My least favorite part of the book was when Katsa was traveling with just Bitterblue because I wanted to hear more about Katsa and Po's developing relationship. This book is filled with strong female characters, Katsa is a graced fighter and Bitterblue shows herself to be a blossoming young queen. If you like descriptions of fights, action, traveling, survival and a beautiful love story this book is for you.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I would rather read books on religion & science. My neighbors daughter recommended this book & I feel sorry for myself for buying this nonsense book. I believe in real God not in a fairytale.

1476715904|5.0|I loved this book. I read it in 24 hrs and had a hard time going to bed because I didn't want to stop reading it. The main characters, Will and Lake, pull you in from the start. I had a couple whoa moments because I knew nothing about this book when I started it. Even all the side characters from friends to family members were just as engaging. Luckily I have book two, Point of Retreat, in my hands so I can start that immediately.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|One of the most philosophical reads ever....beautiful book!  Fanciful adventure across dessert sands...inviting you to explore the world beyond its physical understanding.
B0041VV03A|3.0|this movie was interesting in that it deals with the issue of human cloning and what could happen which then presents a lot of other issues. I felt the movie took a weird turn towards the end and I didn't like the way it turned out.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalini Singh is one of the few romance writers I haven't regretted buying in [the kindle edition of] hardback.  Her plots are compelling, her characters are fully-fleshed and interesting (no tstl heroines here), and the writing style is smooth.  I appreciate that over 12 books she's maintained a consistent world view while still differentiating her characters when many other writers have long ago fallen into the &#34;same plot, different cover&#34; canyon.  I read this book in 2 sittings and am already planning to re-read it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When is 0.7.0 going to come out for the Amazon app store everyone already has it from app store to play store
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Heart of Obsidian by Nalini Singh is the 12th book in her Psy/Changeling series.  My favorite book in the series (I love them all), was a tie between Slave to Sensation & Kiss of Snow. Notice I said was, though it is close.  I never thought I would love a book just as good or better with the hero being Kaleb Krychek, especially in competition with Hawke or Lucas.  But Heart of Obsidian was simply amazing.  Nalini Singh continues to prove that she is a master storyteller, and in this book she has created a fantastic masterpiece..<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian is Kaleb Krychek's story, as we knew it would be after the end of Tangle of Need.  We did not know who was the woman he had found, and what did she mean to him?  We learn early that Sahara Kyriakus (Nightstar) was that woman, someone deep in his past, who turned out to be a fantastic heroine. This book belongs to Kaleb and Sahara, in so many ways.<br /><br />The book picks up immediately after Tangle of Need, with Sahara transported to Kaleb's home, where he slowly tries to get her out of a labyrinth shell, which she herself put together during her 7 years in captivity.  Right away you are surprised how gentle, but firm Kaleb is with Sahara.  We know from the start she is important to him, but Sahara does not remember Kaleb.  This is a surprise, as Kaleb has always came across as the most powerful psy; cold, calculating, and extremely dangerous. With Sahara we begin to see a different side of Kaleb, and Nalini does such wonderful job in salvaging him.<br /><br />This is not to say that Sahara wasn't equally as wonderful as Kaleb.  She was awesome, and possibly one of the best heroines in this series.  As Sahara begins to heal, and trust Kaleb, she sees his inner darkness, and knows how dangerous he is. But she also sees the goodness in him and together they will discover each other, as their love grows, and each will heal in their own way.  Kaleb loves Sahara, as he knows she is the only person who can save him.  This was such a beautiful romance, with two damaged people, who lost and found each other.<br /><br />It is Sahara who will get Kaleb to reveal his past, and how he came to be what he is.  We learn the horrifying truth of Kaleb being trained by the evil Santano Enrique, and the things he had to endure.  Sahara uses her memory of the young Kaleb, to help show him not everything is dark, and the light inside him is their love.  The fact that Nalini can get us to care about Kaleb is something, but we got to love him, as much or then many of the other psy/changeling heroes.  Since all the heroes in this series are awesome, this was an amazing feat by Nalini.<br /><br />Kaleb and Sahara's romance is so emotional on every level. As always, the sex scenes were hot and steamy, but there were some added elements of humor that were funny. For example, when Kaleb professed to be a virgin, and after they had hot and heavy sex, Sahara asked him how he knew what to do, or if he tested on someone.  He offered to share his research on the internet for her to read.  Lol<br /><br />Besides this wonderful romance that pulled on our heart strings, not to mention the intensity, Heart of Obsidian continued the ongoing civil war with the Pure Psy against the Psy Council and Changelings.  Kaleb was the hero throughout, working with his Arrows to save many people from the destruction being done by the Pure Psy.  Though there was a constant worry that Kaleb had other plans, & the extent he would he go to control the Psy net.<br /><br />We get to see some of our other favorites like Aden, Vasic, Judd, Mercy, Faith, Vaughn, Nikita, Anthony, and briefly Hawke and Lucas. There was a lot of intense action throughout, with all the factions helping one another to fight the evil Pure Psy.<br />The ending was very exciting, with some resolution, as it is a game changer.  However, much is left open to see how this change will affect the Psy & Changelings, and most of all...Silence. There is so much more to learn, and more enemies to defeat, but I can't wait for what Nalini has in store for us as she reaches the final few books to end this arc.<br /><br />Will Silence survive?  Will Sahara be able to keep the darkness inside of Kaleb in control?  Did we learn who is Ghost?  Yes, we did, but you will have to read this book to find out who it is.<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian is an emotional roller coaster, very intense, exciting, and an amazing romance.  It is this romance that totally surprised me, being so beautiful, so much emotion, and very passionate.  I can't say enough of Nalini Singh, who has become one of my top favorite authors, how great a writer she is.  Not only can she take a character seemingly unredeemable, dangerous and make him someone we would fall in love with; but she continues to amaze me how she keeps all the details of this complex world so precise, flawless and brings us to an exciting climax still to come.  Bravo Nalini, you outdid yourself in this book.ore to learn, and more enemies to defeat, but I can't wait for what Nalini has in store for us as she reaches the final few books to end this arc.<br /><br />Will Silence survive?

B00CXN2JNS|5.0|The best Megadeth album in years, powerful, in your face music! Great guitars and drums, and bass. I also has something vetern bands seem to lack these days, that's great lyrics!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Not much to say here. It's a solid, well constructed adapter that does exactly what it's supposed to do. The magsafe technology snaps solidly onto my old charger and snaps solidly into my new MacBook Pro. Yet, it's small enough to not represent much additional bulk.<br />Great product allowing me to make good use of my old charger instead of having to purchase another brand new one!

These guys remind me a lot of the old Prog bands, style-wise I remember back in my youth. We didn't call it Prog back then, it was &#34;Art Rock&#34;. &#34;Escalator Shrine&#34; is my favorite on the CD.

B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a must have. In my opinion, all electronic devices that we tend to use a lot shoud have a calculator because you never know when it can come in handy. This one is great because apart from the basic functions of division, subtraction, multiplication and addition, you are provided with all functions of a real scientific calculator. With this app, who needs a calculator?
B005LAIHRC|5.0|this is a cute, funny, light hearted and cool movie to watch.  it's korney and hockey in many spots but the acting is absolutely great and the music is the best!  enjoy it..my husband and I surely did.  we even went to vegas to see the live theatrical performance of it.  the live stage show was fun and good...but the movie was..well, you know...Hollywood like!  Get it, you won't be dissappointed

B008B1BL4E|4.0|WWI as the third Balkan war--that is one insight from this superb history of the ten years between 1905 and 1914. One comes around not ready to caste blame on the Germans any more than the other powers who were playing with fire and not realizing how it would to all of the major European powers. The portraits of the key decision-makers are fascinating.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|That was beautiful, I absolutely loved the book and its now definitely one of my favorites. Strong characters and a conclusion well woven together.

B00CL0J99K|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />I realize as I write this that I have not submitted reviews for either of the other two Iron Man movies or the Avengers tie in movie - all three of which I loved.  This was an enjoyable movie also and I am not disappointed that I went to see it, but it was certainly not the best of them and is probably the worst of the four (counting the Avengers).<br /><br />There were lots of good things in the movie.  Robert Downey, Jr. continues to prove that the rebirth of his career (after rehab) is not a fluke. I love to watch him act (as both Tony Stark and as Sherlock Holmes). I also loved that Tony Stark suffered from severe PTSD resulting from the Avengers movie.  That was a neat tie-in.  Also, the special effects were as good as always.  I even liked the fact that Pepper Potts became one of the heroes at the end of the movie, but that was too easily foreseeable the moment Killian (Guy Pierce) injected her with the formula and was even more so foreseeable when she fell into the fire.<br /><br />There were, however, just as many disappointing things as well. (SPOILER) Tony gets his chest piece removed?  Really?  I hated that.  I also hated the whole drone army thing with the suits.  Jarvis may be a really good AI, but somehow I doubt he could have controlled all of those suits in battle... too SkyNet for me... perhaps too Deux Ex Machina... and definitely too over the top.  Guy Pierce continued to be a problem for me personally... I just couldn't watch him without thinking of HG Wells and The Time Machine- but maybe that is my personal problem.  Similarly, I just thought the fire breathing aspect of his character was just ridiculous.  It didn't work for me. Finally, there just wasn't enough Iron Man for my taste.  It was supposed to be an Iron Man movie.  Instead, it was a Tony Stark movie with a little Iron Man and a lot of Jarvis thrown in.  Sure, Tony Stark is Iron Man... but if that is the case then make it so.<br /><br />So... in summary... mixed feelings.

B005XBA9Y8|5.0|I have the original MG50000 of the Pictures/kubelik vinyl in excellent condition.  Mercury used a black/silver label for this release where the later Kubelik/CSO releases were on the maroon silver label.
B005XTLAQQ|1.0|I ordered a \\"NIB\\" Wedding Bella, with a box that had \\"never been opened\\". We received the doll, and was surprised to see the box had been lazily scotch-taped closed, and Bella had no ring. Never again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down! It had a great story of love that was complimented by romance and sexual tension that had me captivated! I never judge a book by its cover, otherwise I'd miss out! I gave it a four star rating because it was a little drawn out. Still worth the wait for the ending.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|As I was slogging through hundreds of pages of seemingly pointless drivel, it occurred to me that the author was just wasting time because he didn't know how to end the book. He admits as much in the afterword, when he admits he changed the ending at the suggestion of his son. Good lord, how bad was the original ending?! Years ago I wanted to see what the fuss was with King. Friends of mine who are fans recommended \\"It\\". I forced myself to read all 70,000 pages (it felt that long) and thought, THIS is the best-selling author in the world!? I was intrigued by the premise of this one, so I decided to give him another chance. Two-thirds of this could be chopped out easily, in just a few minutes by an editor. Of course, no one edits Stephen King, or J.K. Rowling, or Dan Brown, or any other obscenely popular author. It would take too much time to work this into shape.<br /><br />If I ever see the word \\"obdurate\\" again I'm afraid I might snap and start punching people in the face. Does King not own a thesaurus? The love story which hijacks the book is embarrassing, cringe-inducing nonsense. The coda feels like it belongs to another book. And I am sure we are frightfully impressed that he knows the name of so many 1950s pop songs. Congratulations, Mr. King! This is awful, amateurish writing. I have trudged through two of King's books. I wouldn't read another of his books if it contained the winning lottery number and the cure for cancer. Why, why , why do people buy and read this garbage?
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This book is promoted as being about a dramatic encounter between a US bomber and a German fighter over Germany. But, as it says in the first chapter, it is really about the life of the fighter pilot leading up to the encounter. I found Franz Stigler's story fascinating. It is such a tragedy that such a brave, skilled and dedicated man had to exercise these attributes in defense of such a horrible cause.

B0011ZVTEO|5.0|I was privileged to visit Cuba earlier this year and fell in love with the people and the music. Now I just can't stop listening. I like this album because it has a good mix of styles and artists. My biggest regret is that I didn't discover this music or these artists until after they were gone. But the fact that they were touring and still loving the music, and there were still huge audiences turning out to see these fellows when they were in their 80's and 90's is a testament to the timeless appeal of these songs. You don't need to understand the words, you can feel the music. &#34;Dos Gardenias&#34; by Ibrihim Ferrer is an outstanding song in the bolero style and his voice speaks directly to my heart and soul, there are a couple of great piano cuts by maestro Rubin Gonzales, and several &#34;son&#34; style songs by the incomparable Compay Segundo. This is a great introduction to the music of Cuba, and I guarantee you'll be wanting more from these artists. Check out the you-tube live concert by Compay at L'Olympia and you'll see what I mean about the vibrancy of these musicians.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say but you need to watch this one if you have watched the other seasons. I am so waiting for the fall for the next season.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing.  It has such a different feel from &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;Catching Fire&#34; in a sense all of the glitz is gone.  It is a very exciting read and a great place to close out the series and the story of Panem.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|haven't really had a chance to use this much, but what I have is fine and it is easy to read.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did not enjoy this book at all.  To much bouncing around.<br />I would not recommend this book to anyone
B009RH9FR6|5.0|She loves this cover.  I got her a Fire HD first and really felt like it needed a cover.  This is perfect, it can stand up on it's own.  The ability to rotate really helps as the chargeing port is on the side so if you are jusing the stand, you may have to change the angle.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|according to some reviews I almost stop reading it, but thanks I didn't because I really like it.  I would prefer less sex (even it was hot) and more dialog between them.  I like also the fact that it isn't finish but dissapoint since we waited too long for this third book and who knows when the next one will come...
B00003CXTG|4.0|This disc had a few hiccups in the playing.<br />I took it out of the player, cleaned it, and it did a bit better.<br />But overall, it doesn't play like new.  It still has hiccups.<br />But for 1 cent and 3.99 shipping I'm pleased.  It's a very<br />good movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is awesome! Works great without any problems. A wonderful tool to have. Don't have to worry about having any other app with this. No interruptions to worry about. I am glad I got it. Try it, you will really like it

B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|A departure from previous daft punk albums, but an absolute gem among their discography collection.  This album is a must buy, must listen to if anyone has ever enjoyed daft punk before.  Or even if one likes the mid 1980s synth sound, but with some updated 21st century flare.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|So authentic and heartbreaking, with a great silver lining. The characters are quirky and loveable and so perfectly written into the novel. Loved it!

B009R659L8|5.0|I have read and enjoyed all of Mary Higgins Clark's books.  This one was no exception.  I gave it five stars, because as far as I'm concerned, Mary Higgins Clark is a literary perfectionist.

It is simply what it says, a battery app. Nothing else<br /><br />Reasons not to get the app:<br />1. It doesn't really do anything. You click on the app and it tells you how much battery you have. That is on the top of your screen anyway.<br />2.You have to have Internet connection. WHY?!<br />3. Its a waste of app space because it just tells you what you can see from the top of the screen.<br /><br />At least it didn't cost money.

B004LWZW42|3.0|\\"Peace was never an option.\\"<br /><br />Superhero movies are tricky business. They have both high and different types of expectation from their viewers. They need to weigh fun versus good story telling versus fan apprehensions versus creating new fans versus yada-yada-yada. This can be done, movies such as The Dark Knight and Iron Man have proven as much, but it becomes a lot more difficult for a franchise like X-Men to do the same when following in the shadow of disappointments like their previous two entries, X-Men: Last Stand and X-Men: Origins - Wolverine.<br /><br />This newest installment is a prequel to all these other films and, in essence, I suppose you could consider it a reboot. The very first scene is the exact one from the original X-Men film shot ten years ago, only now it follows the story of Erik Lehnsherr and Charles Xavier in the tumultuous era of the 1960′s, in the middle of the Cuban missile crisis. There are some interesting plot twists and some historical fiction that come into play. This volume introduces us to idea of fear for the unknown and the battle between those who believe that the powerful must rule against those who believe they must help instead. As far as ideas go, there are plenty here to make an excellent film.<br /><br />But, as I think deeply about this movie and compare it to what it could have been, I cannot say that it is an excellent film. No, despite my strong wishes and desires for it to be otherwise, upon reflection I cannot convince myself that this film is more than just mediocre. It's a leap and a stone toss better than the last two films but still not where it should have been to make a real difference.<br /><br />Let me throw this at you; the first half of the movie was really quite brilliant. The development of Erik's powers and his eventual hunt for his enemy were awesome. But the first hour was overpowered by the complete collapse of the second portion of the movie. What seemed to be the start of an intense plot against the world was poorly rendered by the enemies hiding in a submarine for about forty minutes of the film. Scheme resolutions came too quickly and too easily. Powers developed at an alarming and inconceivable speed. All these things combined with the poorly choreographed action sequences and lower grade musical score made the movie deflate at the rate of a rogue balloon.<br /><br />There were some real quality moments in this film. Shots that will stay in my mind for a really long time. And there was some great potential as far as character development, but they just couldn't hold on to those nuggets when finishing everything up. The early friendship between Professor X and Magneto was there - stated - but you would have never gotten that out of the film unless it wasn't literally handed to you through the script. Choices were made without really being given the time for the characters to develop reasons. Allegiances shifted from one side to another without second thought. Basically the final portion of the movie was a convoluted mess and the climax was less then satisfying.<br /><br />One of the greatest problems - and challenges - with the film was the fact that most everybody knew how it was going to end. In the same way as you knew that Anakin Skywalker was going to become Darth Vader, you knew that Erik Lehnsherr would become Magneto. The `how' this was going to happen was what we really expected to blow us away. But the revelation came with no more than the fizzle of an already open soda pop, lacking in flavor and in kick. This was probably the greatest disappointment of them all.<br /><br />To say that X-Men: First Class is a bad movie would also be a lie, however. The stars of the show are quite impressive in there performances and they pick up the slack of the poor script and denouement of the film by their talented acting and charisma alone. James McAvoy is a great Charles Xavier, giving the Professor a bit more flare than we'd have originally expected but keeping it all grounded in a way that makes us comfortable. Michael Fassbender is an incredibly talented actor, with an amazing range. He seems to be what I like to refer to as `flavor of the month' in cinema. He brings out the bad boy in Erik Lehnsherr, all the while keeping you convinced that, even though he's not the good guy, Magneto is pretty freaking awesome.

Michael Fassbender is an incredibly talented actor, with an amazing range. He seems to be what I like to refer to as `flavor of the month' in cinema.

1250012570|5.0|After reading/inhaling Attachments by Rainbow Rowell, which I loved, I had very high expectations for the author's upcoming young adult release Eleanor & Park; and, sure enough, I was far from disappointed. Rowell has a special talent for putting realistic and seemingly ordinary characters in a new light where they can shine and grow without changing who they really are or what they stand for.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is a first love story. It takes you back to a time when you feel awkward and insecure and weighed down by the pressure to fit in. There are some underlying issues that play a role in the story, but mostly it's about love and acceptance.<br /><br />I loved the title characters. They were written perfectly. Every flaw, every thought. All their likes and dislikes. The humiliations and triumphs. I was in high school all over again. Eleanor and Park are both very likable and relatable characters. They're not perfect, but they're so real. It's always refreshing to find characters who aren't the most popular or are conventionally beautiful. They got seated together on the bus on Eleanor's first day of school, and while that first \\"meeting\\" was awful, they were eventually drawn towards one another and formed a special bond. I can't give up too many details without spoiling the whole story, but there were so many scenes that I fell in love with. Comic books, mixed tapes, makeovers. I thought the contrast between their parents and home lives was substantial and gave depth to their relationship and to the characters themselves. I also loved how Eleanor/Park would see herself/himself in a certain way, but through the opposite character's eyes, she/he looked completely different/better. It reminds me of that song in Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella: \\"Do I love you because you're beautiful? Or are you beautiful, because I love you?\\" I love that song, by the way.<br /><br />After finishing Eleanor & Park, I am now thoroughly convinced that anything Rainbow Rowell writes will be golden. She is definitely an author whose works I will be following. Love love loved!!!<br /><br />Review can also be found on http://jennreadsfiction.blogspot.com/l writes will be golden.

B008YWY0HK|4.0|\\"If you had a chance to change your fate, would you?\\"<br /><br />Pixar is one of the very few reliable film companies out there. And by reliable, I mean that you know exactly what you've signed up for, what to expect and it is always delivered. Walking into a Pixar is like going to an amusement park. You've been on the rides before, you've learned the layout pretty easily and what there is to see, but 20 years later you still have a blast.<br /><br />Brave is a little different from other Pixar films in the sense that not everybody can relate to the characters and plot. The theme of the film is deeply grounded in a study of free agency and the power that individuals have to make up their own lives and futures, but at the surface it's simply the story of a girl and her mother trying to see eye-to-eye. This is very well done but no matter what experiences I have in my life, I will never understand what it is to have a mother/daughter relationship. The emotion is there, the humor and desire for conciliation as well, but being a man...well, all I can do when coming out of the theater is smile and say \\"That was nice.\\"<br /><br />Despite this major element of the plot, there are many other things that can be learned and appreciated from this film. As mentioned above, free agency is a big part of the story along with its friends, the great theories on nature vs. nurture. To top it off, throw in a dash of unconditional love, then contemplate the effects of hasty or impulse decision-making and blend it all with both the fear of the unknown and the courage - or bravery - to take it on. Serve while warm and you've got yourself a pretty successful dish. Say one thing for PG films, say that they've got a message to share.<br /><br />Where Brave is lacking compared to its compatriots - Up, Wall-E, Monsters Inc and others - is in scope. The setting was small, taking place inside a castle and its surrounding the entire time. Characters never seemed to travel more than an hour away from this central location. The turn-around of main events was also very short, most plot points being resolved within minutes. The bulk of the film must have taken place in about 3 days timeline. It just seems to me that the types of challenges that were being faced by the characters might have taken more effort to resolve. I wish there had been more time and vision spent on actually getting the characters to interact with each other.<br /><br />The film was a bit clich&eacute; at times, but what do you expect from a kids film? They thrive on clich&eacute;, so no real complaints there. Graphically speaking, Pixar technology basically leads the industry and Brave is pretty much visually stunning. From the feathers on the ends of arrows, to the curls in Merida's hair, to the flow of water in streams, the vision they are able to convey onto the screen in nothing short of jaw-dropping. Solid - though not outstanding - soundtrack and great vocal performances. I found myself easily slipping into this world, almost to the point of forgetting it was CGI. Not quite, but almost and I know the day is almost here.<br /><br />I need to mention one more thing that I truly appreciated about this film and that was being shown a child and parent willing to fight for each other to the very end and no matter what. In a world as crazy as our own, it is easy to forget that we have people on our side and who are willing to do whatever it takes to protect and maintain us. Equally, it is easy to forget that those same people are not invincible and could use no less from us than what they are giving. Brave wove this into the tapestry of the film beautifully and - whether or not it was intentional - I found myself deeply moved by this aspect of the film.<br /><br />Brave is not the best of the lot - it's no Up - but on a scale from lame to amazing it's quite good. I was overall pleased with my experience and would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for simple and clean family fun. There are a few moments were the humor was pushed close to the limit of appropriate for your five-year old, but these were pretty sparse.  Take it all in with a grain of salt and you'll be sure to walk away from those ending credits feeling warm and fuzzy inside.<br /><br />P.S. The Pixar Short that runs before the film, La Luna, is a masterpiece that deserves awards. Absolutely fabulous, I could write a whole review on those five minutes alone. Go see Brave just for this short film if you must, it would be worth it.ew moments were the humor was pushed close to the limit of appropriate for your five-year old, but these were pretty sparse.

B0034G4ORC|2.0|\\"We make our stand here.\\"<br /><br />The poster/cover for this movie was really all I needed to want to watch it - along with the fact that I was able to see it for free, I made that happen. From this point forward, however, let it be known that I would never recommend this movie to anybody unless they could also see it for free.<br /><br />Alien invasion movies are to science-fiction cinema as vampire romance novels are to the Young Adult book industry. There are so many of them that 90% get washed out with all the other trash that is poor film making. There just isn't much to be said anymore about aliens that come to earth to destroy us for our resources. Survival Sci-Fi just doesn't cut it anymore. The formula is always the same. Aliens find us > Aliens want our water/air/whatever > Aliens kill lots of people > Sometimes we win, sometimes we don't. Boom! There it is.<br /><br />The secret to success for these kinds of films is to throw a wrench into the machine so that it will explode in our faces. Something different, but relate-able. War of the Worlds (2005) - focused on family and becoming a better father. Cloverfield (2006) - Home video journal of what happened to very ordinary people (a la Blair Witch). Signs (2002) - rebuilding faith, along with the sense of seclusion from the rest of the world. These are wrenches that successful brought more credit to the alien invasion backdrop. Battle: Los Angeles` wrench was to follow American troops through the nasty, scary reality of battle for the protection of the weak. Did it work?<br /><br />I have to say that with the heat of the war in the middle-east this concept was a sure-fire for getting people into the door. Everybody loves our troops. Only once you're in and through that door, none of the finished product really delivers. All the elements are there: Background stories of these great men and women, a view of the sacrifices they make for civilians and their families, the humanity and dreams of each one. It should be enough to keep us hooked and attached. It should be enough to make us care. It should work to make a decent film, but...<br /><br />...well, let's just come out and say it. This isn't a good film. Not even close. It's actually a pretty terrible film.<br /><br />For starters, let's go to the characters and background stories. In any good story, there are good characters. And for any good character there is a good background. The characters in Battle: Los Angeles have potentially good backgrounds and all seem like characters I might care for - but there are about 25 of them. No joke. The first 30 minutes of the film were spent showing little snippets of each one's current story, trying to shove in as much background possible in the 60 seconds that were spent on each individual. Before any action even took place, I was already telling myself that there was no way I'd remember did what or cared about whom, let alone names. Combine this with the 2/3 Rule of any invasion movie (as in 2/3 of all your characters are pretty much sure to hit the dust) and you're looking at a really low interest value for your characters' development.<br /><br />The effects are good, but the creature design and action choreography are horrid. Sure, there are guns fired and lasers and buildings blowing up all over the place, but the renditions are really very poorly mastered. We're talking - and yes I'm going to say it - Syfy Channel poor. Despite the big budget and high potential for some real bad-A action sequences (who better to show up the aliens than the military?) much of the luster was lost in the underwhelming attempt of making the soldiers seem real. I understand that the director was going for a more emotional approach, but the result was a platoon of uninteresting soldiers whose names I don't remember running around without taking any initiative. Yes, if aliens really invaded, we'd be screwed. No, the military is not a club of super-heroes. But still...<br /><br />It occurred to me while watching this film that we really love to think of ourselves as the good guys. What easier way to look at ourselves in a good light than to have somebody else be the threat we're fighting against. \\"If aliens came to earth, we'd be like to Indians to Columbus,\\" they say. Why is it always like this? Aliens need water, so the assumption is automatically that they are going to kill us right off the bat? Found planet, has water, enter orbit and destroy. It makes me wonder if man was the first into space and looking for new worlds, would we automatically destroy what we found without first attempting diplomacy or type of communication first? Of course not because we're the good guys, and even though they have greater technology and understanding of the universe, they wouldn't understand anything closely related to diplomacy.<br /><br />Where have all the good writers gone?<br /><br />When evaluating or thinking about all the elements of this film, there is no way I can give it a good rating. The heart is there, but the execution is not. Bad camera work, poor plot-line and character development and, while Aaron Eckhart does a good job, most of the acting is only slightly above mediocre. No amount of sentimental value toward our troops will push us beyond those flaws, unfortunately. The wrench was thrown, the machine crunched it up and spit it out.d to me while watching this film that we really love to think of ourselves as the good guys.

B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Hannibal is a show that keeps you on your toes, it's full of little things that keep you wondering about the next episode all left out for you to decipher on your own. They keep you right on the edge of knowing characters completely so you never know what's coming, which is brilliant. The writers have you caring for each character strongly. It's so good I watched it all in one day, and I'm watching it all again right now. And it's even better the second time. And, It is the most beautifully filmed show I have ever seen. You will not regret this if you love a good thriller and story.

B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Robert Jordan loved his works, it was obvious, even more obvious that Brandon Sanderson did not love them on the same level, especially this one in particular. Not a slight on Sanderson, he did well for someone writing the final books of such a fantastic series which will go down as one of the greatest in fantasy literature...but in the end, the ending fails to exude the emotional ties that thousands of readers and fans have come to expect. The epilogue is nothing more then an added addition to the last chapter rather then a look into the future that the book continually alluded to like so many others in the series. If there was going to be more novels written about the world in which the Wheel of Time takes place, then I could see the ending as being more then sufficient, but as it stands...it leaves too many questions, not enough insight and a complete lack of closure for readers and that is why I am giving it a lower rating then others in the series. Overall it's worth reading no matter your take on the series, but for those of us that are die-hard fans it does fall short of expectations.

B00BEXB18M|5.0|After thir13een came out I was put on sort of an edge I was kind of expecting, wanting more of the same if not with more intensity. It was a surprise though to find that the album played out in a slower and more even pace, there wasn't really a race to do as much damage as possible(see Sudden Death). Instead what I got was a meandering treat and something of a sedative to help sit and meditate on things(good bad?) in some ways it makes me remember how selfish I can be but what ever. I think I'm starting to see a patter in album releases. And how they differentiate between thrash and experimental.<br /><br />Overall this album is less thrash and more metal, though all songs on the play list are good, there are one or two that I maybe need to run through again and there are three that I especially loved. Primarily the Blackest Crow I think is the one that set me grinning for a day(it's very unique for Megadeth, I would like to hear another track of this style in the future). Oddly while I do like Kingmaker, it didn't set in on me as quickly as Beginning Of Sorrow, and the title track Super Collider was not what I had hoped it would have been (I wanted something to rival the angry beast in sudden death) But none the less I was still satisfied in some kind of empathetic acceptance of the end of the world? I'm not sure, (insert) though I do know now that for my taste in music it was a little to romantic for my taste.<br /><br />When I look at a comparison of their recent music I see that Th1rt3en was about speed and reckless power, while is Super Collider has become something entirely different almost like they were tapping the latent pulse of classic rock for inspiration.<br /><br />Now an explanation on five stars.<br /><br />When I purchase music I have a rule that I rarely compromise on, that being said the rule stands that I have to really like at least 6 tracks. This being said, the album fulfills this rule. Now, why if I wasn't hot on a few of them did I assign 5stars and not something like four point five or three? Simple. I'm not the artist and I have no control over the music they make and would never assume to push them to satisfy my own selfish desires,(besides you can only sing about violence and death so much before you lose your edge) in saying that, I have to say that where it's not the LHC that I was dreaming up. But! I still got a very good album with some exceptionally good songs. And I'm sure in the future Megadeth will release something that can make my blood boil, but until then I'm very happy with my purchase and will look into the album and I'm very confident that I'll find something hidden with the line of text that will make the album that  much better.<br /><br />I think My one qualm was the cover art, but that's just cover art... unless there's a limited edition with some really cool stuff on it. but I don't think that's the case.<br /><br />Sorry I hate bad spelling, stuff you know. So I edited it out a little bit.

B00D2CYV9E|5.0|I should start off by saying that I typically do not write movie reviews, so I hope what I write here is helpful.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about this movie at first based off of the previews, but after watching it I completely fell in love with it. It was sweet, emotional, upsetting and beautiful. Matt Damon and Michael Douglas were incredible as were all of the supporting actors! I found myself a little heartbroken by the end of the movie and could not help but crying, but I still watched it again and plan to watch it again in the future. If you are putt off by man-on-man action, just know that there is VERY LITTLE in this movie! I know that's a big deal to some people, so I thought it was worth noting. This is truly a must see and I love it!

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Now don't get me wrong, it I s still a micro transactions game, it's worst offense being event dinosaurs that sell for an ultra limited time and for far too many Premium dollars (no doubt an encouragement to spend real money on the game) but all in all Jurassic Park : Builder is a rather solid game with a bit of an addictive quality to it. And yes, while certain things encourage you to spend money on the game you can grind through the game without ever feeling pressured to drop real money on the game... and in this present economy that is a good thing. With enough difficulty to task you, but nit frustrate you, and a decent feel of progression and accomplishment, this should be one of the SIM games you should be playing. Pity the game can only be played while online but that is s minor complaint... unless you don't have reliable wireless internet, then pass on this. A 4 out of 5.

I found the pictures too small and no way (even using the magnifier, which became a pain with each page) to increase the image.<br />Simon's cats is probably one of those books that is best read as a book (like the Garfield strips) and not on a kindle.<br /><br />Buy the book, definately, but dont buy a kindle version.....<br /><br />My saying I dont like it, in no reflection on the book, it is a reflection on downloading it to a kindle... I love Simon's cats and will always... I am looking at actually buying the book.
B000000OAA|5.0|While it contains only one radio friendly piece known to mass audiences (Killer Queen) , this is Queen's finest album, and one of the best progressive rock albums period. Queen was many things over their career, but their prog rock period (roughly from Queen II to A Night at the Opera) was their most memorable, and this album is the most consistent of the three despite ANATO having their biggest hit (Bohemian Rhapsody)  Of course, these are subjective statements but I stand by them!

I understand a lot of<br />people feel this book not as good or dynamic as Da Vinci's code, but in<br />my opinion it is better. Just open your mind to the reading and stop<br />comparing as you read. Do your retrospective afterwards and feel the<br />energy of the story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read. Absolutely loved it. Couldn't put it down. Even stayed up until 2:30 in the morning to finish it when I had to be up in a few hours for work. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer. This made me cry because it was so good. Crazy twist at the end. I can't even put into words how much I loved it. Must read!!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was unbearable. The main reason why I bought it was because I had already read the first and second books in the series, so I wanted to finish out the series, even though I was less than impressed with the second book. Going into this book, I was hoping that things would get better, but they didn't. The dialogue between Eva and Gideon was terrible, people do not talk like this in real life. If I had to read one more page about how they love each other but have problems and how they can't bear to be apart I was going to puke. So instead of puking, I returned it after reading about 50 pages. I just couldn't do it anymore. Nothing was happening and I was just finding both of them annoying. From what other reviews are saying, it doesn't seem like I missed much by not finishing it.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This book was interesting. I love Mitch Albom's books but this one kind of disappointed me. It made you think ans had a good point but it was really hard to get through. I think the beginning par of Doe's story bored me, but the way he tied it all together was good. Liked the end but took me a long time to get to it. I usually read his books in a day. This one sat around for a while because I just couldn't get into it for so long.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|My daughter lent me her copy after she read it.  I was unsure about reading it because I had heard it was very sexually explicit.  Once I started reading, it became impossible to put down.The development of the characters, how they grew to love each other  so deeply, to me became much more important.  It definitely shows the sacrifices willing to be made if you truly are totally IN LOVE with someone.  It also really shows that what goes on sexually behind closed doors with 2 consenting adults is a very private affair.  I LOVED THIS SERIES AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE I KNOW!!!!!!!

1591391105|4.0|This should be required reading for everyone as they progress in their career. I made a mistake in not recognizing the different STARS scenario I was walking into when I started a new job. Being hired from the outside to a sustaining success mode is a really difficult situation and it requires much more contact with your manager than I expected. Most of my experience had been in start ups and they need to be handled differently. If I had read this book when I started my earlier position I believe I would have had a much better chance of making it more successful.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get the game!!!!! It is so awesome if u are a temple run fan then u will love subway surfers
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|I have nothing to add to the nearly-unanimous chorus of praise for this show. I'll just say this:  Ian Richardson gives the greatest performance in any medium in the history of the world.  Watch his cheekbones when the Prime minister rejects his application for advancement and you'l know what I mean.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like this app because whaen i play my game it shuts off when i dont want it to but now i know how long i have :3 sweet!
B009NY43NY|3.0|The first half of the book was paced typically for the later Sookie books, but as the end got near, the pace increased, and it was clear it was time to just end the series, and tie it all up. Its ever-so-slightly open ended. A short story would fit as a tag-up.<br /><br />These could have kept going (it was,after all a big world), but I guess when you have no more to say, its time to move on.
0446569909|5.0|YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK, IT WAS QUITE A HIKE FOR OZZY TO GET WHERE HE IS, THIS BOOK IS SO REAL AND SOOOOO FUNNY< ENJOY
B000OVLBGC|5.0|What can I add? Not much I am afraid except to add yet another high rating. I am 312th review and there has been a lot of detailed praise already. I will say that I thought that the ending was a bit of a surprise, but it worked for me. If you think about it, there was an deep intimacy that was very paradoxical on the surface. Interesting to ponder. Almost poetic.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have negotiated and drafted prenups, and they are the opposite of romantic.  When Eva found one, I was hoping she would kick Gideon to the curb.  Only SD could actually make a prenup romantic!!<br /><br />I know this isn't the end to the series, but it certainly could be-- it ends at a logical place, and there are not any real questions left.  I rated the first in the series 5 (in case you think I am too easy, I rated Shades of Grey 2 stars), the second 2 and this one 5.  The first 3/4ths I rate a 2, and the last 1/4 I rate a 10 plus!! I didn't like the first 3/4-- too anatomical, just sex, sex, sex, with very little plot. But the last 1/4 had lines that made me swoon, just like the first book.  Love, love, love it!<br /><br />I don't think I will preorder the 4th and 5th books.  I don't think Eva and Gideon can solve their issues in 2 more books, and I don't find the continual push and pull very romantic.  It is very repetitive.  So I consider this a trilogy, and overall, it gets 4 stars, compared with 2 for SOG.  Maybe 4.5.  Or 4.75, based on the prenup.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This film should have been bigger.Great story,great villians,great casting,great acting,great transfer to disc,in color,exciting,suspenseful,great visuals,lots of action,and funny.Don't forget the popcorn....support your favorite artists.
B00112GVFO|5.0|I've always loved this movie.  It's funny and adventurous.  I would recommend anyone to watch this movie.  I will watch it again.
0765325950|5.0|As a third time reader of the series beginning to end, it was wonderful to finally get to the true end! Lotsa tears, but a beautiful goodbye.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Why do I loathe you, Hugh?!?!?!  Primarily because you wrote the \\"WOOL\\" series, and then the \\"SHIFT\\" series and now somehow I must carry on and be calm for several months whilst I wait for the \\"DUST\\" series to be released!!!<br /><br />Not a science-fiction aficionado by any account, I did read the John Christopher \\"Tripod\\" series when I was an elementary school student, and believe me, that was odd for a girl to do in those days.  The books of the \\"WOOL\\" series give me the same satisfaction I felt back then -- as if I had truly discovered a fabulous new world.  The plot-lines are sometimes horrible and sometimes charming, and on more than one occasion I would read a few pages, think \\"Oh, I see what you did there, Hugh Howey\\" and then barrel on through to the next chapter.<br /><br />As other reviews have made note, it makes for a particularly pleasant endeavor to read pages with clear grammar and correct spelling.  So much easier to follow the quickly moving storylines!!<br /><br />I believe the characters are well-developed -- a few are glossed over at the onset and then fleshed out several chapters later.  I have become quite fond of Lukas, so of course I expect in \\"DUST\\" something quite dastardly will befall him.<br /><br />Potential readers, do not allow the fact that these are of the science-fiction, futuristic genre deter you from reading -- these are stories about people and the human nature that can be the downfall or the survival of our future.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|A def recommendation for sci-fi fans! Easily the most satisfying sci-fi flick I've seen in a long time! Make sure to have good sound cause the soundtrack is excellent and nicely compliments the atmosphere/visuals.
B0073RBQY2|5.0|Playing with this has a few limitations:  it does not fly or glide; the wings bend, but only slightly; the beak and head area are pretty stiff.  The toy is beautiful, however, and I would buy many more if they were in different poses.<br /><br />The wings are softer and bend, but they also return to the original placement.  After a few weeks of making the flap, it seems like they should break or split; however, this has not happened.<br /><br />Great toy for dinosaur fights or for display.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I say biased b/c I am a big 30str fan but I will def admit that this album is heavily-produced. As a reviewer notd accurately when This Is War came out: each album sounds completely different. This is very true. The odd duck on this album is easily 'Conquistador - sonically, it is the only song that has traditional guitar, bass, and drums. Lyrically, also with the chorus, it seems like a B-side from This Is War.<br /><br />IMHO, their strongest LP is A Beautiful Lie.....I like a little bit of screaming (see Breaking Benjamin & The Used) and it showcases Jared Leto as a very capable song-writer with a powerful set of pipes. Sonically, it is the perfect balance between programming/production and the traditional band structure. Their classification of style has changed over time: it started out as Space Rock/Progressive Rock to Experimental Rock. Experimental is fine but I think of other prog rock bands like Radiohead when I hear that term. As a reviewer has noted on this LP, it is more of a testament of the producer's than the band's prowess. However, it is undeniable that Jared Leto has a great set of vocals and it a tremendous song writer; which is why every 30stm LP resounds w/ me.<br /><br />I can't help but listen to this album and think: what are the other 2 doing? It's so synthetic sonically, that I debate their degree of input. Also, I've seen 30stm tour on every album and can only wonder 'how are they going to reproduce this on stage?'. I wonder that whenever I hear synthetic sounds from a traditional band.<br /><br />My favorite song changes every day: Do or Die I liked right away but right now I'm digging Bright Lights. Also, City of Angels is good but seems too contrived (see With or Without You by U2). As I said, I like this LP b/c I'm a big 30stm fan but it's not for everyone.....a more casual fan might give this a lower rating.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is easy to access. I don't mind the ads; or it wouldn't be free. I like that it keeps score for me and my challenge is to improve my time and score..
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love Rocky and this item was in very good shape and was delivered on time.  The only thing is that discs 1-3 played in both my playstation 3 and blu-ray player.  But disc 4-6 would not play at all in either device.  Had to return.  But was refunded quickly.  Other than the product not playing, I had no problems
1451675046|3.0|I've read about one-half of this book.  It is written for a lay audience, but at a level that seems more juvenile, e.g. directed toward adolescents.  Or toward someone who has no background whatsoever in the sciences?  Not sure if I would recommend it.
B00B7FWWNA|1.0|Too much is too much!  Far from erotic, this film dulls your senses with prolonged scenes of sexless nudity leaving the viewer feeling numb.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The Four Agreements are so relevant to our lives!  But they are a challenge!  As the author points out, we are so programmed to behave negatively, critically, judgementally, it is hard to overcome these habits.  This is a book I will go back to and reread, to reinforce my efforts to live a more positive life.
B009G78EE2|5.0|love love love every single song!! this is by far one of my favorite CD's. the lyrics are very eye opening!
B004LROUNG|5.0|His books are allways so exciting to read you never know whats going to happen.  I read a lot of his books
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It does everything the kindle can, except mine is smaller.  I plan to buy a kindle when I pay my android off.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Thought about buying this book just because I have the first 2 and for the most part enjoyed them, but just the huge amount of mixed reviews for this book have me hesitant. And THEN to find out 2 more are on the way? Have to pass this time. :(
0679805273|5.0|Perfect from a &#34;grandmother&#34; perspective to communicate some thoughts for graduating and going to college....it was FUN to personalize it as well.  Great truth in this book...but needed real TRUTH added....heard about it from my recent Theology class and was really impressed.  Pam
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Easy to use and upgrade with more items. Not too pricey for the newest items and quite a lot free for users. A very neat app for pictures.
B0012GN3AU|5.0|Just recently, I ordered this CD from Amazon.com. It was time for me to add to my Alice Cooper collection & I was ever so glad that I did.  I think that \\"The Last Temptation\\" album is fantastic.  I would like to spend time sharing my review of each song:<br /><br />1.  \\"Sideshow\\"...I really love the CARNIVAL feel to this song.  This song is quite enjoyable, in my opinion.<br /><br />2.  \\"Nothing's Free\\"...This song is my TOP favorite on the album. It really made a lasting impression on me, right from the beginning.  The CHORUS, the beat & the music is just perfect.<br /><br />3.  \\"Lost In America\\"...This song seemed very familiar when I FIRST played this CD. I think that maybe I heard this on the radio. The words to this song are rather comical. Good beat, too.<br /><br />4.  \\"Bad Place Alone\\"...This song is okay.<br /><br />5.  \\"You're My Temptation\\"...This song is also quite memorable.  I like this song a great deal.<br /><br />6.  \\"Stolen Prayer\\"...This song is rather haunting, but it's pretty good.<br /><br />7.  \\"Unholy War\\"...One of the more CATCHIER songs, which I like quite well.<br /><br />8.  \\"Lullaby\\"...I really love this song, but it sure DOESN'T remind me of a LULLABY, whatsoever. It's real creepy, more like a bad dream, or a NIGHTMARE, perhaps.  \\"Get Down, back where you started.....Get down, back into HELL\\" are the words that best help me to remember this song. I also like the scary bells, near the end.<br /><br />9.  \\"It's Me\\"...This is more like a ballad, but I think it's the NICEST song, on this album. It does remind me of The COOP'S two previous hits, from the 70s, \\"I Never Cry\\" & \\"You & Me\\", somewhat.<br /><br />10. \\"Cleansed By Fire\\"...I think that this is the most INTENSE song on this album. This is very haunting, but also really good. And again, I like the scary bells, near the end.<br /><br />Since I rec'd this CD on May 30, 2013...I have NOW ordered 1986's \\"Constrictor\\", 2000's \\"Brutal Planet\\" & 2001's \\"Dragontown\\", from Amazon. This album \\"THE LAST TEMPTATION\\" is most definitely recommended.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|It's a great game for kindle fire HD ...but you have to pay real money for guns. But it's still a great game
B00BSWMITK|5.0|New band members, but writing of these songs has Joe's stamp all over them. Solid effort and definitely worth adding to a Satriani collection
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid Cabin Fever is another great book about Greg and his family It is so funny and once you read it you won't stop then you find out you finished the book. That's what happened to me. I recommend reading this book more than once
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a fun game to play.  i just started but think i will be playing this one for a long time to come.  hats off to the makers of this one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The biggest thing was the fact it was simple to set up. THE ALARM WENT OFF AT THE SPECIFIED TIME AND IT WAS EASY TO BOTH RESET THE TIME OR TO TURN IT OFF.
B000A1INBC|2.0|Pros: The LPs are translucent and blue.<br /><br />Cons: 2 LPs come in a single jacket, i.e. it does not fold open and there is only one slot. The main problem is it sounds terrible. It is very loud (compared to all other records I own) and the high pitches are extremely distorted. Things like cymbals and vocals with &#34;sh&#34; or &#34;t&#34; type sounds sound very bad. If you are looking to play this on a hi-fi setup, forget it...
B0093BUWGE|5.0|I'm impress by Jose James diverse catalog of musical arrangements. This album is seductive, warm, glowing, and pleasant to listen to. If you want jazz, neo-soul, a touch folk, hip-hop, funk, and slight of salsa this album is great to play at a party, on the go when enjoying vacation, or whatever you do, this is the take easy album to invest in.<br /><br />Keep it up Jose James!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The best.  Start with the first season and enjoy TV programing that is the very best.  If we just had more of this type of programing.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This is a great game to play on my Mac- iPhone-and PC. However I do not recommend playing on the Kindle Fire. Regular games are ok but I find the tournaments go so fast the Kindle can't keep up. Consequently you don't get true points for bingo's. Very frustrating!
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|Great product, good value for money, clever box to keep all the KOL albums together. Very pleased with the product and the delivery
B007IXWL2C|5.0|That was the perfect ending for an amazing trilogy.  It's all about happily ever after.  I'm not sure what the bad publicity was all about.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This Music CD was very good.  I love the music.  I have played it a lot.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B0090RSYVG|3.0|I bought this for my stepdaughter since she loves Loki.  I was a little disappointed, the figure seems like it will break easily.  The cape is a piece of cloth that looks likely to rip and the figure is pretty much a lego dude that doesn't come apart.  I hope I'm wrong because my stepdaughter loves it.  I was hoping for something a little more solid for the price paid.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|If you like angry birds and flow then you should check this one out. The challenge level is about the same and they are similarly fun.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Love these guys!  Great CD but was a little bummed to find out there was another version with more songs on it.  Make sure you get the deluxe version, it has a few more great songs on it.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|The movie had no real story. The characters were introduced very quickly with no reason to be there. Mixed up plot.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|liked all the songs, I am a big 80s fun. I play the CD a lot and many others like it
B008D36INE|3.0|Not bad but the story line was weak and I do not like people wanting to kill themselves over love.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|its a good app because it comes in handy when your like in a hurry so ya this app is good so get this app
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|These guys are getting bettered but they still lack complete originality. This album is much better than Contra and maybe even the first album.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can't stop playing it. Determined to get up the high score table. If I don't at least complete the daily challenge I feel cheated. Love it...
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|Very interesting story that can be shared with students, with a little care.  Amazon delivered as promised and met the schedule we needed for school.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|For a so-called PRO Version of an app, it sure is lacking in features. All it does is tell you how much of a charge you have left. Big deal, the Kindle has built in services that will do that. If you want a truly full featured app you can customize, try Battery HD Pro. It's a much better utility, you can set notifications for any charge level, and there is much more information available concerning the battery and previous chargings. You can also get Battery HD, which is the free version. It does the same thing but has ads. I found the app so useful I bought the paid version.<br /><br />Battery Pro (this app) is basically useless and a waste of money, unless you picked it up during the faotd special.
B00338QELU|5.0|I've read quite a few of the Wallender series.<br />I think Mankell goes into much more depth, motive and character development, with this set of characters. The villain, Ya Ru, is drawn particularly well. He's ruthless, a psychopath, and downright scary.<br />The tension, where's Ya Ru... or what will Ya Ru do next, keeps one glued to the end of the book.<br />I found the book very engaging. I learned a lot about China, Sweden and Africa.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I enjoyed the book because it was a sookie Stackhouse book but honestly was a bit disappointed in this last book. Not in how the plot ended but in how it was written. Seemed as though she gave less thought into this one than the others. However, all in all it was a good book, I'm sad to see the series end.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Not sure what all the bad reviews are about, because this book was great!!!  Loved the character development, not as much steam in this one, but a great story between Gideon & Eva. So glad their love story gets to continue!!!!  Bravo Ms. Day!!!
B003954I9C|5.0|I have wanted this cd for so long.. I am so pleased to finally say I own it!! He is my favorite singer of all time, NO KIDDING!! The shipping was fast what made me even happier & the price was cheap which seriously I would've paid more!! But thanks :D
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This game is okay;  there are easy and difficult levels but it doesn't show the excitement that other games do, ie: Angry Birds series.
0307269981|5.0|The trilogy is very easy to read, can't put them down. Very intriging, easy to visualize. I loved the movie too.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This one is a challenge and lots of fun.  I have other angry bird games and enjoy them all but this one adds some challenges I didn't see in the others.  I would recommend this one for those Angry Bird players.
0062082353|5.0|Chris gives us an interesting insight into how our nations best of the best operate on behalf of our countries safety.  What a patriot.  He is dearly missed.
B001974DG0|5.0|I found it exciting all the way through.  A very good mystery and would recommend it for those who like stories like this.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I can't wait for the third book!<br />I need to start checking for completed series before starting a new one.<br />Waiting over a year for the final book is frustrating.
B00992CF6W|4.0|awesome but for some reason I cant get the new update with baby animals??? does anyone have that problem??? other than that this is the best building app ever
B005JZBP8W|5.0|I have always loved this particular movie and it has two of  my most favorite actors love this blue-ray version
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This will end up being as big a classic as the book or original movie.  It's a bit much for the younger girls and some scenes are a bit more graphic than in other versions, but he acting is outstanding and the music is brilliant.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|I have always like the movie and the actors. I think is one of the classics of a golden era of Hollywood moviemaking
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|arrived in good condition.  my daughter is required to read this as part of her summer reading program for high school so the  price was definitely a positive.  Wasn't brand new, but certainly good enough for summer reading and note taking.... and saved quite a bit over new pricing.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|this app is pretty good but it is a little hard to complete levels after about the 12th level. the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is unbelievable.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I shouldn't need to say any more!  Had to have this..... to add to my collection.  It's one of very few ovies I could watch over andover again
B0098G67TU|4.0|Having never opted to get this on DVD since the original VHS came out, it was worth the wait to watch this in a beautiful clear picture once again.
0143038419|5.0|One of my favorite books. Absolutely life changing from the first page. I've read it twice now and I know I am not done. The movie doesn't even begin to scratch the surface.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|If you don't own this movie, you really should. Great action, emotion, suspence. Tom Hanks is fantastic in this movie. A wonderfully told story about a piece of American history.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|nice jack ryan continuation. good fast read, hope he keeps writing this series of books. I will keep buying them if he does.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I've had this app for a while now and it works great! But all the sudden the mp3s I downloaded have started to delete themselfs. Please fix thx
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I love these watches! I have the green and blue Seiko 5. I've had them for over a year. Very comfortable! When I saw they had a black one as well, I just couldn't resist. So I ordered it today. For me, its the perfect size and weight. It keeps excellent time. Its \\"automatic\\" so no need for batteries either. You will not be dissapointed with these watches. One more note, the day and date are easily set. Update, this new Black Seiko 5 has Malaysia movement. My first two are not. It doesn't matter too much for me, for the price, but I thought I'd mention it. I love all 3 Seiko 5's I have. Green/OD, Blue and Black. You can't go wrong for the price.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Better than the movie. Slow at first but by the middle I couldn't put it down! The ending was wonderful
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I am having fun figuring out the answer to each puzzle and getting the three stars.  Interesting challenge!<br />Worth the price.
B00CL50KDY|4.0|This is a well thought out comedy. There are some things that were inconsistent with a post zombie world but I think these things just add to the comedy.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This is a fun game, but I don't log into it like I do my other games.  I only have two friends that play it, so it must not be well liked.  It is hard to draw the images, but still fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is way better than temple run!!! Can't stop playing it hahaha and anything to complain about really:) No money for it makes it that much better
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I can't explain why, but this very simple game is completely addictive.  I love trying to beat my own high scores!
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie shows the devastation of people and property,as well as the compassion and empathy of human beings for each other in times of chaos and destruction. A triumph of the human spirit!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Now you can play with your food. Granted, I never had red pudding growing up, but still it is fun, and provides at least some challenge. The first set of levels is well thought out to teach the game, and with no time limits allowed for pre planning.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|My grandson and I enjoy this movie, arnold back doing what he does best. Can't wait to see the next one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Didn't even realize this was on my new Kindle Fire, started reading and was immediately hooked. Thanks for a great read.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I like this app. It is a great alternative to Pandora  and the selection of genres is bigger. I think I'll keep it :-)
B000FCKGPC|4.0|As with other reviewers, I must agree that the chapters of \\"un-named\\" individuals were dry and hard to get through at times. The best, however, was always, hands-down, Cersei. Wow, do I love that bitch! She makes the evil queen in Snow White look like Mary Poppins. Wow. Everytime I got to a \\"Cersei\\" chapter, it was like \\"HOLD THE PHONES\\" or \\"DON'T TALK TO ME\\" this is gonna be good. And it was. I confess, there are a lot of names, houses, etc. that I just can't keep track of. After I finish the last book, I'm planning on re-reading the series just to catch things I know I've missed. Also because I'm going to be in mourning when the series is done and I don't know what I'm going to read next that's going to be half as interesting as this series!
B005H9B44A|3.0|I really liked this as a comic book movie. The backstory of Asgaard and Thor isn't well known so all the space scenes were necessary. The BBEG wasn't too evil and they took him down rather unexcitingly but I can't wait for the next one.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This definitely brings back memories for a gamer. So many hidden fun things to look for during the movie. The actual story was great also.
B003Z0FS9U|3.0|CD'S SOUND GREAT AND THE PACKAGING ALSO GREAT! THERE IS TWO DISKS AND NO BONUS DISK LIKE THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS CD SAYS THERE IS. VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE IS NO BONUS DISK WITH THIS SET!!!
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|The first time BSB have done an album with Kevin Richardson, but it hasn't affect them musical talent.<br /><br />The Intro shows that even as they four are older now, they still have perfect harmony.<br /><br />'Everything But Mine', 'Any Other Way', 'One in a Million', 'Panic'  and 'Treat Me Right' are catchy mid-tempo songs and has some of the boys past tunes of that same conposing.<br /><br />'Inconsolable', 'Something That I Already Know', 'You Can Let Go', 'Trouble Is'<br /> 'Unmistakable' and 'Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon' are beautiful electric guitar love ballads.<br /><br />'Helpless When She Smiles' and 'Love Will Keep You Up All Night' is a tender and intoxicating love ballad about falling for a alluring beauty.<br /><br />Overall, this sixth album done quite well and has REALLY well done tracks and even without Kevin. Nick, Brain, A.J., and Howie musical talent is UNBREAKABLE!
B000MRTGW4|5.0|Cute, detailed, well-priced, well-made, what more can we say other than we love this little Squirrel and also are gifting friends with it.<br />Bless you all.
B002KAJ0AO|4.0|'Straight Through My Heart', 'Bye Bye Love', 'All of Your Life (You Need Love)', 'Masquerade'  are great mid-tempo Dance songs with a great hook.<br /><br />'Bigger', 'Undone', and the title track are swell mid-tempo ballads and are do quite well.<br /><br />'If I Knew Then' is a trippy Pop song that has a bit of edginess of 'Don't Want You Back' while 'PDA' has a more high-tempo.<br /><br />'She's A Dream' has a beautiful melody and has a hint of 'All I Have to Give' while 'Shattered' is filled with a Dramatic play and is a very emotional ballad.<br /><br />Overall, the sixth studio album does well with some great Dance tracks and further shows that whether they still don't or will have back Kevin, this STILL IS the Backstreet Boys.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|It seems not so often one finds Snail products which are close to being anatomically correct and also cute, but this Snail is serving both descriptions relatively well, so, yes, we love this Snail, and, yes, have already gifted this Snail to friends finding this Snail cute, and our purchases are through our favorite Amazon for good pricing, shipping, and service. Bless you all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing but when is the next update coming out? Update .7 is already out on the iPhone/iPod/iPad. Otherwise my favorite game on kindle fire. Also whenever the update comes out... join my server.<br /> glitches so that I have unlimited diamond gold and iron.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|This a fun show with characters that are easily enjoyed and adventures trigger the imagination.  It will be a great spinoff of the new Star Trek movies.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Normally I wouldn't finish a series like The Hunger Games. I kept putting the book down and it did take a long time to finish. The plot drew me in but the writing was pretty bad.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading the other reviews I was not going to read this book. I am so glad I did!! Sylvia made me fall in love with the characters all over again!! I can't believe people are this mad over an ending. It was not a cliffhanger, if you don't want to buy another book it ended on a good note! But if you love the characters like I do you'll be happy to continue their journey!!
B004EK91LQ|5.0|I love all of the Step Ups from the original to the last one. I love how Camille is back from the first Step Up and Moose is back from Step Up 2: The Streets.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Way to go Disney; charging $31 (normally the price for a 4 or 5 disk combo pack with 3d/ blu ray/ DVD/ digital copy from Disney) for only a 3d copy.  What happened to the regular blu ray copy, oh wait you are going to make me mail in to get that and then charge me another $6 to get that;  sounds about right.  How many people own all 3d TV's? Next to none. Looks like i am either not going to buy this is 3d, or probably not buy it at all.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|The only difference between this and kindle, is it gives you a percentage on your notification bar. It also gives you the temp and health, which I really do not think it`s worth paying for. I would not recommend paying for it.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I bought this book awhile ago and found it while looking for a paranormal read.  It was quite unexpected and pretty fast paced.  I finished it quickly and enjoyed Blade with his alpha tendencies although he was not predictable.  Honoria was a strong heroine that I could relate to and both of the main characters made the story entertaining. I loved both POV' s and plan to read the rest of the series.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was really anxious to read this book because I loved the first two.  I really feel like this story is getting drawn out and is spreading thin.  It's completely unrealistic for a relationship to have so many flaws and for the two people to fight and argue so often and prevail.  Nothing new happend in this book and am certain that it could have been finished up with a bang in this book but no...it is going to be drawn out for two more books.  Seriously, how many shananigans can one person get into.  It got tiresome through out the book with the repeat emotional and sexual experiences.  They were all the same and I ended up skipping over some of them just so I could get the book done with.  I am not sure yet if I will purchase the next one.  I would really like to see where Gideon and Eva's relationship goes and ends at in the book but I am not sure I can bear to read through two more books like that.  I am giving it two stars because I originally really liked the story so the book had me at least interested to see what happens and I read it in one day so it was a short read.  All in all very disappointed in this one.<br /><br />After much thought I ended up returning this book.  I was that disappointed in it.  I will not read it again and wanted to make sure the author new it wasn't worth the money (even if it is just $10).  I see way to many similarities between this book and 50 shades, which isn't a huge deal but the author doesn't seem to be putting much effort into the story with this one.  I was confused by the amount of time spent on each character instead of focusing on the story between Gideon and Eva.  I don't know what else to say except read at your own caution.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I still love reading this series - ready for book 4 - I love all her books & really anxious for a lush kiss of surrender !!!

B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series is like a lord of the rings tale that never has to end. I so appreciate a well produced series that builds and develops the plot instead of dragging it out. I love this new kingdom and will come back here as often as I can.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Originally when it was in the theatres I wasn't able to see it so I read the book instead. It has become one of my favorite books and I just was able to watch the movie and it was so great! It of course varied from the book in some parts, since it was more aiming towards teens, but I loved it. There were some serious moments, some really funny moments and some cute moments. At the end, though, I was smiling and I wanted to watch it again, I would recommend this movie and the book to anyone!!

B00AB7HESI|3.0|I played the original on the DS, until my son lost it, and while the game is essentially the same, the puzzles are all weak. I paid for the additional worlds, I'm on world 9, and it still feels like the kiddie pool. Too many of the puzzles are \\"give each person what they want.\\" There are very, very few of the great \\"figure out how to get to the Starite\\" puzzles like the original had. The ones that require clever thinking instead of giving the cowboy a hat, the musician a guitar, the ballerina ballet slippers.<br /><br />It's like they intentionally chose the lamest puzzles instead of the best.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I like the all the food but it goes away to fast and it gives me extra things like wall paper but it says that I can't get a oven intell  four more levels.
B00CAZOHDO|3.0|I was so excited about this new album since their EP is one of my go-to albums to listen at work. However, it is a bit let-down for me. Besides the songs from the EP, there are only a couple of songs in this album that are up to the high bar set by the EP (\\"Kangaroo Court\\" being one of them). I don't care for the new mix for \\"I Sold My Bed, But Not My Stereo\\", my favorite from the EP. If you don't have the EP, definitely get this new album. However, if you already have the EP, you won't miss much if you just purchase a couple of the new songs that you like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good reflex game its not like temple run cause temple run is easy whith no obstacle<br />But subway surder is harder and adsictofe
B008N1LL42|4.0|Hard to find a movie these days that isn't a) full of radical leftist actors who I refuse to support or b) infected with leftist cant that I refuse to support (making the bad guys our own military, or evil businessmen, or some other leftist trope that Hollywood perpetrates as unconsciously as breathing).<br /><br />Nothing leftist about this movie. Otherwise its just okay and in places pretty goofy, as when the &#34;hero&#34; goes from an America's-stupidest-criminals video star to commander of a destroyer with the only transition being his brother picking him up by the scruff of the neck and saying (to keep him out of jail) &#34;You're going into the Navy.&#34; What? Next scene he's a commander?<br /><br />Just think of this intro-backstory as a realism-level calibration for your mind, but the basic theme of the movie actually makes sense: advanced aliens are likely to look at us the way we look at rabbits, so maybe we shouldn't to trying to tell them what a great little planet we've got here.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to use a positive-negative rating system for movies, something like Debbie Schlussel's system that goes from 4 Marxes to 4 Reagans. Then I'd give it a +2, not only not-leftist (+1), but watchable. That's pretty rare, so 4 out of 5 on the Amazon rating scale.
0812982622|3.0|I kept putting this book down and vowing never to pick it up again but I slogged through it for my book club discussion.  It's memorable but, even so, I can't recommend it.  The graphic violence and the magical realism combo didn't work for me.  If North Korea is anything like this (and I'm pretty sure it is) I don't know how anyone survives.  If you are a strong reader and curious to explore the dark underbelly of humanity, give it a try.  For the more faint of heart, run away and don't look back!

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|OK I started reading this only to get on Facebook and see some not really glowing comments made on this 3rd book of the Crossfire Series.  Yes I might have been a little disappointed that this was not the end of the story as I too was under the impression this was a trilogy.  But guess what folks, things CHANGE! I am more than ready after reading Entwined with you to read further into Gideon and Eva's story.  I got what I wanted from Entwined, the story stayed true to the previous Reflected and Bared to You books, and the main characters grew, matured and left us wanting more.  What freaking cliffhanger? I was so worried during reading I almost did the naughty by reading the last chapter first. NOTE I DID NOT, but due to these wacked out reviews I NEARLY DID! Glad I didn't and glad I took the time to reread, because Gideon and Eva's story did not need to be skimmed over. And note to reviewers, please STOP putting spoilers in your reviews. That totally sucks the story up for people who WANT to read, and scares others into not reading a story that might just potentially entertain them. Sylvia Day keep 'em coming and please don't gloss over the BIG details we readers are so hoping is coming up, I would love to read it ALL, not the flash forward, then midway...oh remember when...bam back to present day stuff.  Ok, I'll read it but, but won't enjoy it as much if story takes that route.

0307476073|5.0|In this moving and beautifully written book, Cheryl Strayed recounts the difficult ordeal of hiking 1100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from Mojave, California through much of the High Sierras and the Cascades of Oregon to the Washington state border.  She attempts this strenuous and potentially dangerous solo adventure not only for its own sake, but as an attempt to heal \\"the hole in her heart\\" due to the premature death of her beloved mother a few years before.<br /><br />Although Strayed is a fit 27 year-old when she sets out, she quickly realizes that she is totally unprepared for the task ahead of her.  Her knowledge of backpacking is extremely limited, her pack appropriately nicknamed \\"Monster\\" is too heavy, her boots are too small, and she is generally under-financed and undersupplied for the trek ahead of her.<br /><br />As she faces the day-to-day hardships of this physical endeavor, she also faces the equally challenging psychological hurdles that have afflicted her since her mother's death some four years before- overwhelming sadness, bad life-style choices, the disintegration of her biological family, and the dissolution of her marriage.  On telling this moving and ultimately inspiring story, Strayed never spares herself from telling the good with the bad either about her mother, her relatives and most significantly herself.<br /><br />As we follow Strayed through this adventure we meet the various real-life characters that she meets along this largely solitary endeavor and the predicaments that invariably she is forced to deal with along the way.  This journey sometimes reads like a picaresque novel but with always a worthy lesson to be learned.  We can easily empathize with her as she confronts, challenges, overcomes and ultimately heals \\"the hole in her heart\\" that has inflicted her for years.  It may have been a difficult and heart-rending task she had set for herself, but one well worth the travail for both herself and ultimately us.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Of course this is a great movie.  I wanted to see the difference between this Hobbit and the old Hobbit and this is the best.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|4.5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Yeah, I eagerly awaited what was supposed to be the conclusion to the series. I found out a few days prior to release that it's now a quintet instead of a trilogy. Okay..I'm cool with that for the most part. I know what a writer actually gets paid per book, I know publishing houses want to keep cash flowing and with a series like this... Well they see gold and want to go for platinum.<br /><br />The story overall progressed their relationship in a relatively large way. The plot bunnies went a little crazy with the Corrine storyline, Deanna storyline, and Cary and who will he pick storyline. I'd really love to see the next two books concentrate more on Eva and Gideon than everyone around them. I enjoy the secondary characters, especially Eva's boss and his partner, Eva's dad, and Gideon's sister Ireland, but Eva and Gideon have a lot to work through to be in a completely whole relationship.<br /><br />I hope the final two books come out in quick succession, just so we can get a conclusion to the story. I'm still good with sticking it out with Sylvia Day and Gideon and Eva, I'm too attached to them to let go now. ;) ~ Review by Chris
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book shines light on people that have mental disabilities and those who also struggle with depression. Being that I am someone that struggles with depression, I felt like I needed this book. These diseases are like the \\"elephant\\" in the room that people don't want to acknowledge. Matthew quick embodied them in such a positive yet truthful way. I suggest this book for anyone that loves to read!!!!
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Jim Collins states in his book, \\"Good is the enemy of great. And that is one of the key reasons why we have so little that become great...We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the frame work of ideas we've uncovered.\\" After reading that statement I became very curious and wanting to continue reading to see what are the components that make a good company to be a great company, in hopes of maybe being apply it myself one day I really enjoyed the way in which Collins organized the book. From his five year research study of 28 different companies Good to Great discusses key critical concepts revealed through his studies as to why some companies became successful great companies, while the others continued to be good. Collins found from his research within a great company you will have discipline people, with discipline thought, drives discipline actions. Within each discipline it is broken down into a subset of two components:<br />I. Discipline People<br />  a. Level 5 Leadership<br />  b. First Who... Then What<br />II. Discipline Thought<br />  a. Confront the Brutal facts<br />  b. Hedgehog Concepts<br />III. Discipline Action<br />  a. Culture of Discipline<br />  b. Technology Accelerators<br />I believe by organizing the book in this matter enabled me to really understand the severity of the critical components and how their relationships if applied will in allow a good company to become a great company. Starting with Discipline People, Collins conducted and analyzed his research by introducing the types of leaders you would find in a great company versus those in a just a good company and the characteristics that these great leaders possessed, such as humility and will. They lead with the interest of the company and not for their own selfish reasoning. Next was the First Who ...Then what which discuss getting the right people on board and the wrong people out. Collins states, \\"People are not your most important assets. The right people are.\\"  Collins stresses the importance of first getting the right people in the right places in your company and weeding out the wrong and then figure out where your company wants to go.<br />Next is the Discipline Thought, within the subset of discipline thought a company must possess the ability to confront the brutal facts and not live in denial. Being able to do this will allow the company to stay updated and proactive when faced with making decisions. Collins presented a methodology for the companies to be able to face the truth. He says an organization must lead with questions not answers, engage in dialogue and debate, and use the \\"red flag mechanism\\" where anything that is red flagged is information that cannot be ignored and must be handled immediately. Collins also mentioned under the category of discipline thought is the Hedgehog Concept. The Hedgehog Concept is about a Fox and Hedgehog, where the Fox (good companies) knows a lot about variety of things whereas the Hedgehog (great companies) knew a lot about one thing. Being hedgehog is more beneficial for both the company and the individual because it the clarity drives focus and direction whereas the fox has neither one direction nor focus which can backfire later down the road.<br />Lastly, having discipline people with discipline thoughts will drive to discipline action which uses the culture of discipline and technology as another tool to help transform the company from good to great. Collins also refers to the Flywheel Concept. He says that a good to great company never happens all at once it take a lot of effort and time to get it going, like the flywheel. The flywheel requires a lot of pushing to get it to turn and after x amount of time it will begin to gain momentum.<br /> Throughout the book Collins gives great examples for each discipline and its component and how it either went from good to great or continued to be good. Along with the examples Collins provides pleather of diagrams and charts in the appendix, which becomes a great reference for the reader and creates a better understanding of what is needed to go from a good company to a great company. Generally the book is a very easy read which makes it that much more interesting to want to apply to your company or even for yourself. It takes the feeling of the impossible away, like Collin stated, \\"We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the frame work of ideas we've uncovered.\\"  Overall if you are looking to transform your company, Good to Great is a read that I highly recommend.nued to be good.

B009YN2M7S|4.0|Nicholas Sparks always seems to have some tragedy that brings everything together which is why I guess people enjoy reading them..love with a little suspense. This is a quick read that is enjoyable but I wouldn't say it's a top ten or top twenty on my list of favorites.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|That's the best way to sum up this movie, which is a shame because the premise of McClane going to Russia to help his estranged son is a good one. Unfortunately, that's about as much plot devoted to this emotional arc. McClane and McClane Jr. have zero chemistry and don't seem much different by the movie's climax. It's like the only reason they've reconciled is because it's the end of the movie. If there was no son, McClane could've been on vacation in Russia and the movie would play out, more or less, the same.<br /><br />This also doesn't feel like a Die Hard movie at all. To me, it's always been about a larger than life villain, the police can't handle, against McClane, who only has his wits and a few measly weapons to fight with. And despite this, he outsmarts and kicks their asses. This villain is easily the weakest of the series and if the police were anywhere in sight, McClane could've told them who to look for and let them take care of it. McClane doesn't need his wits for this villain. He just fires HUGE weapons and throws whatever vehicles are handy at the bad guys. And no matter what happens to McClane, he gets right back up with barely a scratch on him. He's more like a Terminator than John McClane.<br /><br />The action was spectacular to watch, but without any stakes or an emotional investment in the characters, it's a letdown. Hopefully the next one will be better so the series can go out on a high note.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was a reminder that sometimes movies can change books story lines way too much, however in the movie's defense they still maintained the essence and theme of the book.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I know some might disagree, but this book's kinda similar to Grounded.  Aside from the gay best friend and her not being able to let go of him so he's gonna still live w/ her now even though she's married.  There's the sex tape and the long boring story-line that's involved way too many other people's issues aside from the main couple.  I wanted to give this book a 1 star but I'm an extremely nice rater.  This was the first book I bought at 1am on release date becuz I love Eva and Gideon, but it so disappointing to me.  I did not rush through reading this book like the previous 2.  I kept thinking of Grounded and when the climax part of the book will arrive, but it never did.  If a book can't keep me focus on it, then it sucks.  I've read plenty of books like that, but I'm only writing a review on this cuz I'm just really disappointed cuz I love Eva and Gideon so much.  Oh, the worse part is... when it reach the last page, the author said there's gonna be another book.  WTH??????  She could've deleted half of this boring book and put an ending to it.  Where are they gonna go from here?  Eva's gonna go visit Brett and have wild crazy sex w/ him?  Gideon finds out and go do the same w/ Corrine or maybe Anne?  Then they can all have a foursome or a fivesome?  Maybe they can bring Deanna and Cary in it too and have one big orgy fest?<br />I really feel sorry for my $10.  I could've gotten 2 MckeyDs's meal with it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have loved the Crossfire Series.  The books are well written and the story has evolved with each book.  With that said, I understand the frustration of some readers about waiting for another book.  It's torture to wait around to finish a story, but Sylvia Day has said for months now this was no longer a trilogy and would be extended by another book or two.  To be honest, I think it was smart of her to do that, and not for monetary reasons either.<br /><br />EWY answered many questions about Gideon's past and you start to see his relationship with Eva grow.  The only plot twist I thought was odd was the whole Russian Mafia thing.  I understand what it has to do with and someone may have given Gideon a 'get out of jail free' card but it would have been much more plausible to say a well known drug dealer or something.  I also thought the whole reporter plot was a little far fetched and could have been developed more.  Still really liked the book though.  Chapter 19 was hands down the best.<br /><br />I honestly don't believe Ms. Day could have wrapped the story up in three books.  Both characters have a ton to work through minus the new stories in EWY.  I'm personally glad everything wasn't crammed into it too.  Feel like book four should be the end though. Can't really see how the story could go beyond that.<br /><br />Well done Sylvia!  Can't wait for the next installment.
0670023329|4.0|North Korea is one of the most scary and dangerous countries in the world. I have read a lot about the country.<br /><br />This memoir is quite remarkable--the story apparently of the only political prisoner who was born in the labor camps and actually knew nothing of the world outside his camp, and who eventually escaped because he heard stories of the outside world from other prisoners.<br /><br />It's very inspiring, and also very sad, because the protagonist still has not found peace in his new life.

B00CW665VI|5.0|What can't I say about this book?  It was hysterically funny and well written.  The story line was a page turner, and I loved reading this story from the male's point of view.  Every word out of his mouth was just golden!  The chemistry between these two characters was smoking hot, and watching Drew become the romantic he swore he was not---excellent!  I read this book in one afternoon...it was just that good.  It wasn't fairy tale romance, but it was romantic nonetheless.  If I could give it six stars, I would do it.  I highly recommend this book to readers over 18 who like romance with realism!

0553212419|5.0|With the craze over Sherlock and Watson from the new TV series, it is nice to go back and re-read the original works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  For instance, &#34;A Study In Pink&#34; episode from the TV series was based on &#34;A Study In Scarlet&#34; from the book.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Quick pick up and play action, and lots of levels to keep you coming back. There's lots of variety to the stages too with some retro game themed levels that you wouldn't expect showing up. The controls are very simple and work well. Overall ak excellent that I highly recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Though when I finished the book I was not fully sated, I was completely happy with the work that I had read.  Part of me expected this to be the final book in the series and was both excited and disappointed.  Excited because there will be more to come and disappointed because I have to wait for more to come.  I felt like the characters were beginning to live their lives and we actually saw more into the past of Cross.  His past and Eva's help move the plot line along as they have overcome many obstacles.  My only true disappointment in the book was the interaction of Eva's father and mother.  I felt like it was not really needed and somewhat distracted from the story line.  Eva and her mother already had enough issues before throwing in this little nugget.<br />All of this aside the wait was well worth it and I will look forward to the next book in the series.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|WTH ! There's really nothing significant in this book but a bunch of jumbled supposed-twists. Useless, useless,useless! I love the first book; kind of  hang-in-there with the second; but this one completely turns me off! CROSSFIREseries? DONE WITH YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|My friend's and me all play Minecraft love the game but, the have apple products i have android.They updated but I can't find the update now I can't play with them very disappointed
B0090EHVMC|3.0|The kids love it.  Not sure I'd want to see it again.  But, it is cute.  Wish it had more content.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Just got the app. Excited to see how well it works. I'll be able to tell you more after I've had a chance to see it in action looks pretty cool so far.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|A very insightful, well researched and refresheningly original analysis of the circumstances leading up to World War I. Highly recommend this to anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of one of the most transformative events of the 20th century.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|It was ok, the previews made it look awesome. I think the idea was really good but the way the story went on was extremely boring really it was. But creative
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A little slow at first but it picks up. Reminds me that you should not judge others and the paths they have chosen. People are more important than things. Forgive quickly and forget so you can move on with life. Harold was a wonderful teacher as he was learning.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great card action and great game selections ... BUT ... have music playing from my Kindle Fire and certain sponsors interrupt music playing and you have to get out of Spyder and restart music. ONLY compaint
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book often had you laughing outloud one moment and crying the next. Wonderful characters who survived gut wrenching horrific childhoods to finally find  peace and happiness in the end!
0307730700|5.0|Without a doubt, the best book I have ever read. A must read if you have not read it. Outstanding.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game helps to pass the time of day.<br />It needs to have some mind use to win each game, so there is a challenge to it.
B009NY43NY|2.0|For those that love the series you will most likely be disappointed in this final chapter.  Maybe I just didn't like the way that Harris chose to end the series.  However, every single part of this ending seemed rushed.  When it takes you books upon books to build up this epic love story between Eric and Sookie and then it takes about 2 pages to pretty much pretend that it wasn't that big of a deal to either one of them, well that's a bit of a travesty to the series in general.  I found myself not really caring about the murder that was the central plot to this book.  We never see what truly happens in the end to some of our favorites like Alcide, Bill and Eric.  I have no problem with Sam, but the passion and chemistry just wasn't built up at all.  I would have MUCH preferred Sookie to end up on her own, a strong woman than the way this one ended.  Use your own imagination to come up with an ending.  It will be time better spent.  It makes me sad to say this because I truly did love the rest of this series.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow!!!!!!  What a story. Never a lost moment.  Can hardly wait for number 4 to arrive.  Thanks Sylvia for you wonderful imagination.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|The world has changed and it's not going to change back.  James describes what is going on with the middle and gives us a road map on how to deal with the change.  This is more than just a business book, it is a health book, a creativity book, all while being a funny book.<br /><br />If you know that you need to begin thinking differently to survive financially read this book.
B001THZAAI|3.0|The French with an added accent was hard to listen to.  Perhaps I missed a lot of<br />the language humor involved with the Ch'tis.  The plot and idea was cute, but a little slow at times.  I will have to watch it a second time.  I read the reviews and expected a little<br />more.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|I did not think it would be this good do the hype it had. Very funny but adult funny .Each must judge on their own.
0802130208|5.0|This work will probably be remembered for a good time to come. It injects itself firmly into the stream of southern literature, most closely following the vein set by Twain's [[ASIN:0486280616 Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]], but while referencing Twain, Toole also demonstrates that he is parting from Twain's tradition by contrasting this novel's hyper-passive, medievalist, over-mothered, over-educated, stationary anti-hero, Ignatius J. Reilly, with Twain's young, motherless, active hero, Huck Finn. Toole combines this ability to reference and transform the tradition which this novel claims to be a part of with realistic dialogue, hilariously ironic situations, and quirky yet believable characters, masterfully crafting a novel that's probably one of the greatest works of southern literature.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I so highly recommended sylvia days books to all my friends. NOT ANYMORE!!! this one was very long and drawn out and just a lot of filler. I am afraid I will have to leave Gideon and Eva's story right where it left off with Entwined with you. I am not reading a fourth book. Shame on You Sylvia Day! I am very very disappointed!!!!  After waiting so long for the 3rd book and then being so let down.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|If you are tired of the usual Hollywood tripe, this is a nice departure. Surprised me and sucked me into the story with strong character lines and unexpected developments. Heartfelt and well-acted!
B0034DGP6S|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has a great writing style, which continues to be showcased with this novel.  As a childless, divorced, soon to be re-married woman, many of the themes and topics resounded with me - and were explored with sensitivity, grace and good humour.  Good effort Elizabeth!  I eagerly await your next installment!
B000XKZQ74|5.0|A nice break-away from the typical Hollywood sludge, this story winds up being a study of human nature. Shocking, unexpected and powerful. I think I'll watch it again...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the third book but disappointed on the ending.  Thought this was the last book but guess I am glad there is more to read.  Just make it quick, please!!  Really want to see how this is going to end up.
1582701709|5.0|I had purchased this book before. Now, I purchase for my friend.<br /><br />To keep it short. This book change my belief and life. It happens the same to my friend. If we think positively, we will attract more positive energy. Indeed, it is really practical to me when I apply it in my daily life. It does give you the overall concept, and it depends on you how to apply. If you do believe on it, it can give positive impacts.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|love the series and I love how the second season has a different story line than the first it's like a whole new.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|Good movie if you are interested and familiar with this period in Paris. Helps to be familiar with Hemingway and Fitzgerald.
0385344228|3.0|This book was recommended by a co-worker, and The plot seemed quite interesting. Unfortunately, this was so dragged out it took me FOREVER to get through it.  It was way too repetitive, and the end seemed so unfinished.  I would not re-read or really recommend it.  Just blah.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played.<br />I highly recommend all who enjoy playing puzzle games.<br />A real thinking game.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I fell in love with this series when I read the first book because it's just so different. It's different then what you normally read and really interesting.  It makes you wonder about what would really happen if our country broke like that.  I like this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone!!!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Cute graphics, good puzzles, high production quality. Seems mostly bug free. I did encounter one situation where the game thought I completed the level with 2 monsters left. Great free app of the day.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|A very promising opening salvo for Sanderson's next epic saga.  It does take a little while to get going, and I could have spent a couple hundred less pages in the library.  That being said, the martial elements are superb, there is a strong setup for political intrigue and the main POV characters are intriguing and dynamic.  I expect the sequel to be a very strong novel, and if this is the price of admission to the next great epic saga, then it is a price well paid.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Very informative, and well produced documentary on one of the best bands ever. In case you've forgotten what they originally looked like, this is a great reminder. I have been so used to their current look, I had totally forgotten their early look. The presentation thoroughly covers all the transitions, breakup, and resurrection of one remarkable group, as well as throwing in an old concert. It is long, but covers the individuals and the evolution of the band over 40 years quite well. Definitely worth it for the true Eagles fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You need to update it everytime it comes out you will lose some customers if you dont give them customor service just saying plz update to 0.7.0
125000098X|5.0|It's not the first of your books I've rated 5 stars. I've been reading<br />your books I was still in Africa (Angola). Amazing plots which keeps you<br /> in suspense and can't stop reading. Beautiful writing, very easy to<br />read, truly enjoyable. I bought the Clifton Chronicles 1 last year<br />during my usual holiday in the U.K. (Cambridge) then nr.2 and last week<br />finished this nr. 3. Believe me, my daughers, son-in-law and two of my<br />grand-daugthers (18 &16) have already read two or three of your<br />novels and short-stories publications. Thus it's not surprinsing that I<br />have enthusiastically recommended your books to all my friends.<br />Because I've so much enjoyed your novels I have to say: Thank you Sir Jeffrey Archer.<br />Sincerey your,<br />Francisco M. F. F. Oliveira<br />Parede - Portugal
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very wonderful series. Gone are the days of charm and chivalry. The main characters  as well as the supporting cast are awesome!!!! They make a wonderful balance of drama, romance and humor.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|Even if you are knowledgeable about the recent financial crisis, getting to know some of the people behind the scenes, their blunders, attitude and body language is priceless. Highly recommended.
B00AEFYX4U|5.0|Very funny movie with great lines thru the movie.  The musical was also fantastic,  Especially the end credits.  I liked it very much.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|The movie was heartfelt, well acted and most enjoyable. I do not get too into plot, characterization etc but simply enjoyed watching this lovely movie. Time well spent
B008XG1X18|3.0|Newest update has a lot of new ways to link potential new pins BUT no longer allows one to add or change a pin description.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown does not disappoint in this novel. The historical facts and artifacts coupled with the story make this an excellent read.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|i ordered this as a birthday gift for a 4 yr old... she got it before her birthday and was totally delighted.  thanks for quick service!
B006LMMN8I|4.0|I was looking for a first dance song for my wedding and I think &#34;Real Good Man&#34; is a strong contender.  Thank you Mr Porter!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|this game really is a lot of fun. however there is one big draw back. I started the game up earlier and found that all of my data had been deleted. so not happy with this game right now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love mine craft any kind of it x box p.e. and p.c. so far I like this one the<br />BEST
B0085YOD1A|5.0|In all the battery apps I installed, this was so far the best. It even gives you the battery info in the slider bar.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I've heard many were disappointed with this book, I have to ask why? with this being a 5 book series, we need 1 book of them settling and becoming one....you can't move a relationship forward without work, self discovery and time....how can they ever be everything they need to be for each other if there isn't time to just be....I'll argue this point to anyone who wants to debate it, but if you really think about all that happened in this book there was still plenty of angst and nervous moments we come to enjoy with these characters, but for their relationship to be healthy and long lasting they have to settle and that is what we saw in book 3, the beginning of that...they have a long way to go, but the steps they made in this book are healthy and mature....I expect book 4 and 5 will give us much more angst with Elizabeth and Brett trying hard to come between them, Deanne, Graves and Ann lurking in the shadows....this book set us up nicely for some good stuff to come!
B000001EL3|5.0|This album was purchased for our son's birthday.  We purchased his first Kiss album when he was 10 yrs. old and now he is 47 and still enjoys their music.  Destroyer is his favorite of all the Kiss albums.  It arrived in mint condition.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Works good even with a DSL connection. I found the controls to be intuitive and worked well with my quoting software. Not to bad working from the Sauna
B00006G8HX|4.0|Even though this film might not be everyone's cup of tea, it is a must have for true fans as it details the depth of Kirk and Spock's friendship and it serves to elevate the Klingons as the original crew's main antagonists.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The book made total sense to me, explaining that the reason I was hungry ever two hours and why if I ate even a few crackers I would binge all day on carbs and follow it up with three days of out of control eating was WHEAT! I knew immediately from my own experience that he was right. Wheat made me tired and sluggish and that's why I instinctively knew to just have veggies and protein for lunch or I'd get too tired and go into a 2:00 p.m. slump. I highly recommend everyone read it and FYI you can buy ancient grain wraps made by Red Engine at whole foods made with Emmer wheat which is the wheat our ancestors ate before it was messed with over and over again to create the Frankenwheat we have today.My husband has lost about 6 lbs. in four days following this plan.<br /><br />However, when you get to the diet plan in my opinion some of the recommendations should best be be ignored. For example, he recommends only 10 blueberries or 2 strawberries. Eaten after a meal with protein, I don't see why a bowl of blueberries will raise insulin much. He does not take into account that eating protein and fat with carbs can slow your blood sugar spikes. Also, eat as many eggs and beef as you want? That has a whole other set of health issues you have to consider. Mayo? That can't be food for you!<br /><br />Here's what REALLY makes sense...  Eat lean proteins, modest amounts of ancient grain wheat like Emmer (yes, some prudent manufacturers are bringing it back - good for them!) , quinoa and brown rice, all the vegetables you can, a fair amount of fruit, nuts, seeds and small amounts of beans, cheese etc... I strongly recommend reading Clean by Dr. Junger. Beans and dairy (we are the only mammal to drink another animals milk and it's not natural) are hard to digest and can contribute to leaky gut (the paleo diet does not recommend grains or beans at all, but this is 2013 and we all love our hummus now and then). Try unsweetened almond milk instead of milk, you will learn to love itmore than milk.<br /><br />What makes this diet work however, is it's a no brainer. Cut out wheat and you've eliminated much of the foods that make us fat, cause fatigue and overeating. You naturally eat less of everything else because cravings are reduced. I just think you have to ask yourself each time you put something in your mouth... is this healthy for me? And vegetables would be a better choice than cheese or mayo!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I love this book. I have read a good many times in my childhood I was able to thank the author myself
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG! I loved this book too.....but the end really? I knew when I was reading it and getting close to the end that I was going to get left hanging, but for how long?  Come on Sylvia this is so unfair! So give us a clue how long the wait will be \\"PLEASE\\".....
B009NY43NY|4.0|We all knew it was Sam, but for some reason i wanted her to go vampire for Eric. Poor Claude....
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|THIS.GAME IS AWSOME SUPER FUN I love it it is so cool best ever it so much fun I like it
B00402FGEE|5.0|This is the best of the Stargate franchise if you are looking for real science fiction. It deals with serious issues in a highly imaginative way and is brilliantly produced. Acting is consistently excellent, with standout performances by Robert Carlyle, Louis Ferreira, Brian J. Smith, and Jamil Walker Smith. Some Stargate fans might not like the more serious tone of this series compared to other Stargate shows - it is tense and never jokey. The aliens don't even speak contemporary American-accented English. (Imagine that.) The only quibble I have with the show is the occasional inclusion of songs that are apparently intended to tell you what to think while the camera pans over various characters on the ship. The time would have been better spent on story. And of course the series ended much too soon. It was the best science fiction on TV, while it lasted.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a well writen and well acted show. The actors take on their characters perrsonas well. There are many twists and turns and the viewer is not sure where the show will take him.
0425263924|5.0|What can I say?  The first two were great and so is this one! I really have got to invest in more Sylvia Day books.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee was able to recapture so much of her young life while kidnapped and gave the reader what it was like for her for all those years.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this escape game. I've never been able to play others past a few levels...get stuck and frustrated and then I don't come back. This was  easy enough but also challenging enough to make it fun. I look forward to more levels in this game. Highly recommended!
B005LAJ212|4.0|I truly do love this show, at least the first season.  It captures a person's attention and holds it until the end.  Unfortunately the writers give away too much.<br />It is about a Woman named Amanda Clarke who is hell-bent on revenge because her father was framed for helping terrorists and then murdered in prison.  Amanda calls herself Emily Thorne.  She has a photograph of everyone who she blames for her father's downfall and as a result her ruined childhood that was spent in institutions, mostly.  There is only one person who is truly looking out for Emily and that is Nolan Ross, a billionaire who gave Amanda/Emily 49% of his company on her 18th birthday.  Nolan wants to help Amanda/Emily because her father gave him money from his personal account to fund the start-up of Nolan company.  Victoria and her husband Conrad Grayson are at the top of Amanda/Emily's takedown list.  Victoria is the only one who even close to being as manipulative and clever as Amanda/Emily.  Amanda/Emily engages in a relationship with Victoria's son, Daniel.  Eventually Amanda/Emily finds out that Victoria's younger child, a teenage girl named Charlotte is really her half-sister.  A good guy, Jack, who knew Amanda/Emily as a child and has no idea who she is now falls in love with her and pursues her while she is dating Daniel. For the most part Amanda/Emily just sets up the traps and like dominos, one by one the people she has set the traps up for walk directly into them and one by one they fall down.<br />What is clear is that Amanda/Emily's quest for revenge quickly turns into a quest for vigilante justice.  The writers obviously can't tell the difference between the 2.  The main and primarily the only difference is that people who want revenge don't care who they hurt, innocent or not, or who they have to knock down , innocent or not, to take down the people who they want to get revenge upon.  Those who seek vigilante justice do care who they hurt in the process and they go out of their way not to hurt innocent people or people who aren't their targets.  Amanda/Emily goes out of her not only to not hurt others who haven't, in her mind earned it, but she goes out of her way to protect Daniel and a few others who need protecting, not only from their direct enemies but from a few of Amanda's as well.<br />My truly big problem with this show is that the writers give away too much and insinuate, to some small degree how the show is going to continue.  Not only that but it isn't hard, for someone that is really paying attention, to figure out how it will probably end.<br />The writers show how Amanda was on a path of self-destruction until she found out and began to believe that her father was innocent.  That gave her a purpose.  They insinuate that Amanda will continue on the path that she is on until she somehow finds her way back, to some degree, to who she was before her father was ever arrested.  After that, and I am only guessing here, but Amanda will probably abandon her life in the Hamptons and find a new one where manipulation and deceit aren't a part of everyday life.<br />Overall the show is pretty good.  The problem is that it is too predictable and it is easy to figure out how it will probably ULTIMATELY END.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This wasn't the best of the series nor the worst. It just seemed to plod in places and seemed to have too many plot lines going at once.
B0057UA486|5.0|It's hard to beat a Kubrick film. A great tale of rags to riches to rags. This film is very lush in content, and looks stunning in HD. A great pick for this Kubrick fan.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Fun and challenging enough to be entertaining. The different levels also require considering different strategies- great for kids of all ages! A winner.
0061537969|3.0|Surprise. Surprise. \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" actually refers to race car driving. I have no interest in this sport but I certainly got the relevance thanks to Enzo.<br /><br />Enzo is a dog, (named after Enzo Ferrari no less)! Denny is a sometimes racing car driver, Enzo's master.<br /><br />Enzo is nothing if not discerning & expects to come back as a man when his time comes with a proper tongue to allow him to speak & of course, thumbs! Until then he is a thinker & watcher of people sagely advising: \\"Learn to listen! I beg of you. Pretend you are a dog like me and listen to other people rather than steal their stories\\". (Pg.102).<br /><br />This book is full of empathy, honesty & insight into the human heart as seen through the eyes of a dog. Enzo is Denny's closest confidant & comfort when Denny must deal with sadness, loss & adversity.<br /><br />Enzo has much to say about growing old; how the body disappoints us & how we must deal with it with courage. He has much to say about many things that are certainly relevant, and who is to say that dogs really do not have the thoughts & feelings that Mr. Stein has attributed to Enzo?<br /><br />Since I don't know I'm quite willing to take Enzo at his word. A charming, surprising, sometimes sad, but ultimately happy dog's tale.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I couldn't use it.  Either you couldn't search, or you couldn't get their popped up screen to close to use it.  I removed right away.  What is it with Google.  I downloaded Google to my computer once and it took over and when I removed it, it left behind some turds of thanks.  I would not recommend it.
0425263924|2.0|I was so excited to read this book, but was disappointed with the ending.  There was no closure at all and the story just stops.  I want more!!
B00A77II0U|4.0|HOs come and go with no set pattern. The story is original and held my attention. The problem in general with all of these is that the HOs rarely have anything to do with the story. Finding fish and dragonflies didn't really advance the plot. However, that's the nature of these games and I try to pick the best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun to play I say it is better than temple run,my son loves to play it. All of you should get it for your phones
B00973902K|5.0|This is a great pop tune from up and coming Carly Rae Jepsen. It ended up being one of the most successful anthems of the 2010-2012 teenage generation!
B00821OX98|4.0|My Son and I were gripped by this series.<br /><br />Would recommend it whole heartedly to anyone that likes a good sci-fi series.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Some of the &#34;Vikings&#34; are obviously more Armenian than Scandinavian.  As someone living in an area populated by the descendants of Scandinavian immigrants, the accents seem off-key.  Other than that, it's great.  An epic tale.  Katheryn Winnick was well-chosen, looks the part, and she shines in this.
1623420148|5.0|Emma is a genius! I would have never thought of writing in first person, but it worked so well I couldn't put this book down and read until four o'clock in the morning to finish in one sitting. Contrary to other reviews, I loved Andrew's character. It was so male, which was refreshing. He had me laughing out loud at times. I didn't take any of his conversations as negative, or slamming gay rights, or women for that matter. It's a book for crying out loud. It's not a real person. I'm sure there are some men out there like this character, but I haven't run into one yet, and I'm 57 years old. I think he says just what's on his mind, and if we were all honest with ourselves, we would all wish that just once we could be as confident and bold as he is. I know I would, but I don't have the courage.<br /><br />It's a must read. The characters are well developed, and the story line is very believable. From one writer to another, my hat is off to Emma. Well done!!!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am disappointed as this is the last book in the series. I love following all of the adventures Sookie has, no matter how out there they might be.
B00BF11STU|5.0|A much better film than Argo and any other film nominated for best picture. The torture at the beginning of the film is not the film. The politicization of that was unfortunate. Great performance by the lead as well.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire charges much faster great product should've purchased it a long time ago and i would recommend this product to anyone who has a Kindle Fire.. Thank You
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As a history buff, I find this show incredibly well done and seemingly accurate to the time line. I am truly addicted and don't want to go longer than a week between episodes!
B00992CF6W|4.0|it takes like 2 week to update so when are like join my game you cant because it has not updated
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What makes Ken Follett's books so great is how he combines history and his characters. Loved learning so much about both world wars, which was such an eye opener. His ability to create characters that are interesting, believable and play roles in the historic events that are meaningful in the overall story.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great follow up album which I didn't think would be possible. Amazing group that always knows how to make you feel good.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Inspired me not just to consider my own journey in life and where I might find pleasure, spirituality and love, but also to take action.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My hubby is a machinist......over 45 years experience.  He is a fanatic about sharp knives and (thankfully) he knows how to handle metals.  I got him this sharpener - at his request - and turns out it works great.  It does what it's supposed to do!<br /><br />Recommended.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This was obvious from the get go and I really didn't expect much from the movie, it's directed towards the younger crowd obviously. The singing was good and that's what I enjoyed the most in the movie, no doubt the voices during singing was dubbed in later by a more talented group.<br />Silly but fun to watch pretty much sums it up for me.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I love any of Dan Brown's books....especially the Robert Langdon  series. He is a FANTASTIC WRITER.  Can't  wait to read<br />his next novel  INFERRNO
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I was hoping for a better story line I suppose and was disappointed because of it. I've seen a similar movie, probably back in the 70's and it was equally depressing as this one was.<br />If what was shown in the movie is what actually goes on, heaven help everyone who flies.
B004I744AS|5.0|If you enjoy learning new words, and not have to work at it, this an excellent way to learn sublimely. One word at a time. And more than a dictionary, it provides encyclopedic information that is thrilling. And the exciting part of this app is it changes daily. You can't go go wrong with this one.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Having only seen the teasers I really had high hopes for this movie, unfortunately it fell short of my expectations. The acting was excellent and Tom Hanks as well as the others should be commended.<br />The plot however was often difficult to digest and perhaps that is my shortcoming but I'm usually pretty good with complex story lines. There were links, vague as they were many times, between all the stories in the movie. I'm still trying to figure out the 19th and 20th century connections. I don't want to spoil the movie but perhaps it wasn't what took place so much as a repeat of the persons throughout this 500 year story.<br />The movie was however enjoyable and entertaining but it wasn't the blockbuster I had hoped for, perhaps you will see more than I could and can make better sense of it all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish the update will come out for kindle<br />fire plus I'm good at it that's why I want it to come  and cor the buckets
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book MUST be read by dog lovers.  Such an insight into the soul of a dog. Makes you cherish your own pup even more.  Get tissues.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I wanted to like this movie, but after an hour of watching I just gave up, this movie was just impossible to follow without a scorecard. I didn't have one, so I gave up.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you liked the first two books how can you not love the third and be thrilled about more sexy as sin Gideon. I loved this book it was hot, exciting, surprising and even a little sad. I seen the biggest change in Gideon so far in this book he his growing up emotionally and but still has a ways to go, thus two more books!!! I say bring it on Sylvia!(but hurry!!!)
0684857219|4.0|Lots of information for the price. Provides some good information on work out routines and what to do as well as areas of focus. Good book for the value.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The best book ever! This is the best novel ever written...5 stars all the way! Love the story line...Wow! Love Kindle too....
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Same as Heat Rises - the writing makes it hard to put this book down.  Well written, The plot line is followed through the twists and turns and just when you think you've figured it out - BAM - another twist.  I've enjoyed all the Heat books and look forward to Sept when the next one is released.
B005721W9O|5.0|The dry wit of this movie will live on as one of the best parodies of the space movies. One of my all time favorites.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Following the pair through their adventures is quite riveting.  Teh unexpected twists in the ploty keep you thinking and make it hard to put this series of books down.
B00006LI4S|3.0|His inventive nature and rock svelt was a major influence in the Pink Floyd days. I think he did the right thing reigning in Roger Waters and his wild pop &#34;The Wall&#34; influence.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Clean, suspenseful, great story line! I would watch this over and over again...it is miles above the usual anti family garbage that Hollywood produces!
B004DK5CYM|5.0|One of the only movies (besides Saving Private Ryan) that I will watch over and over again. The Horse was a phenomenon.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love battery pro. It works so well on my kindle and is so much better than a normal battery app. It works so well. I recommend this app. It rocks!!  : )
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|For some reason I prefer Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto, and the one with Sergei himself playing a favorite. To me a lot of modern recordings are technically perfect, but they tend to all sound alike. This one doesn't, and I really like her inerpretation. On youtube she plays the solo version, which is also very good.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Did not enjoy this game at all.  There are much better racing games out there.  There is no skill involved.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|Bought it for my Grandson love the movie
B0091REZMW|3.0|Too many challenges, and I hate games that keep trying to make you buy things in app. I also hate games that keep making interact with facebook (I can't stand facebook). Sometimes I just want to play by myself.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|It's hit or miss with horror movies these days.  This was one was a miss.  The movie was pretty cheesy and not scary at all.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love the jewel legends tree...I am trying to find new games such as this that are full games and are free ...<br /><br />Any suggestions?
B0091REZMW|3.0|great game if it would save your info to another device need to tweek that.locks up and when you reinstall or update you loose everything.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Not much to say. Good pocket sharpener. I have one at home, one in the car, and one in my bugout bag. Has a ceramic and course section, as well as a diamond rod for serrated knives. Great and cheap, no reason to not get it!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Very interesting background into the orphanage s in Ireland which were based on the authors research<br />  The sexual abuse by priests that is coming to light today. I didn't see the surprise ending but loved it.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The mic sounds great, and the sound is amazing... but with one drawback: it seems to disconnect a lot when connected to 3.0 USB ports. 2.0 has no problems, but the 3.0 ports will have it randomly disconnect and reconnect whenever it feels like it, connected or not. But once you have it all figured out, this is a great mic, and the 3.0 issue is the only reason it got 4 stars.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app is very helpful and user friendly. It is simple to use and very  easy to read with the large buttons.
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|If you love the Halo games, you will love this move.  Really sets the scene for hopefully future movies for us to watch.  Loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun, a great way to be distracted, they have new challenges all the time, and the kids like it too. Best free game I ever found.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Simply awesome  :)  Caught these guys on a Public Television deal by chance and fell in love.  You can't go wrong buying it for yourself or as a gift.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I have a kindle fire so it doesn't tell me how much percent my kindle has. But when I got Battery Pro it told me the percentage of my kindle battery and more I love this app. More of you should download Battery Pro !!!!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Very smart, creative and funny! me and my brother couldn't get enough of it. Only problem is that I can't figure out how to get more potions.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome and I play it everyday its really hard for me to stop playing and I'm pretty sure everyone is going to love it cause I do
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game ever it just won't update. I personally does not like demo versions it just is not cool
1451695195|5.0|Extremely interesting that this man could remember all of this and tell his story so well.Very unusual and actually added to our body of knowledge of what happens!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie was panned by the critics but so far everyone I know loves it! It's glittery, over-the-top performances featuring two of musics greatest legendary talents. This is my favorite modern musical since ..... Sound of Music.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I liked the story & the way it was written & how it wrapped up at the end. It was difficult to pronounce many of the words  & I had some trouble at first keeping the characters straight, so many started with B`s, but it was very good.
B000002VMD|5.0|do I really need to say why I love this album? Who doesn't have those days when a little Whitney makes it so much better?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Luv it !!  It's a must read! I can't wait for the next book!!!  I hope it comes sooner than later
1569242739|5.0|I have been making recipes out of this cookbook for the last 2 years almost every time I need a cupcake recipe.  They always taste delicious, though I find they are sometimes really sunken in the middle and don't look pretty.  The frostings and cupcakes have amazing flavor!  Favorites are carrot cupcakes, low-fat skinny cupcakes and the lemon.  Not all are outstanding, but all are delicious!  I find the buttercream frosting a little greasy with the shortening, so when making for picky non-vagans I do replace it with butter and it's fine that way too.  Highly recommended for vegan and non-vegans both!
B00BMCLCG6|3.0|I am a Bon Jovi fan but this album is just okay. There are only a couple of songs that I really like, and I have heard the same sentiment from others. I got it under a $5 deal so it was worth that cost, but I would not pay more for it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It really ends not only for Sookie but for a most of the characters. Enjoyed reading it better than the last book.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|We watched Coraline with our adult daughter after we all watched  Neil Gaiman's inspirational graduation speech on youtube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAb-NYkseI.  Both videos were wonderful.
B0084I9QIW|3.0|I actually liked the later live show better. I didn't know why his band did a 10 minute performance without him. I guess it was his break.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is ridiculously cute and quite a lot of fun. It's just challenging enough -- to get three stars at each level usually takes several tries (after the first few stages), but isn't so frustrating that you just want to totally give up. I almost didn't download this FAOTD because I thought it was a kiddie game, but it's not (though it can be that too). Plays well on my Kindle Fire HD 7. I've only completed all of the stages of the first level, but I'm looking forward to continuing on.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|First listen was different, second, third, fourth and fifth really grew on me! They took a different approach, but if you read about what Josh Homme was going through during recording, it will make sense.
B007ME5BUG|4.0|I had not read a general history of WWII for some time. This one caught my eye as a way to get introduced to the author. He does an excellent job of mixing a general description of what is going on, along with those little details which makes the narrative come to life.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars? I thought some areas of WWII got short shrift, such as the war in the Atlantic or the mobilization of societies into wartime economies. On the other hand, he spells out how Japan's war with the Soviet Union had a major impact on the war in Europe, something I did not fully realize. So he does cover quite a bit.<br /><br />Because of the excellence of the writing, I will look to read other books by this author.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Fun on a long term basis. Wholesome. Enjoyable. Suitable for children and adults. A great game that I thoroughly recommend to anyone
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I have been listening to Jimi Hendrix's music since I was a child. It is very rare for me to come across a recording I had never heard before. Well done!

B00C33M2EE|5.0|A notable second cd with wonderful ranges of melodies that both soothe and excite the senses.  Please, keep them coming!
0425263924|1.0|What a waste of time.  Return it! Teach these authors we won't be strung along.  Really? an entire book of \\"you are everything to me\\" and \\"I can't get enough of you\\" but wait...I'm going on a date with my sexy ex.  Then just when you think you are finally getting to the STORY...turn the page...THE END.  Now its a trilogy in 5 parts.  Shame on You.  Everyone should return this lazy effort.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great game,Ilike it, I can't hardly put it down, I would recommend it to my grand kids.It's a mind binder.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I realized I had been afraid to really ask for what I wanted. Taking the small steps in the book helped me to ask for the really &#34;big things&#34; and...I got what I wanted!

B00C7L8DM2|3.0|The preview was way better than the actual movie.<br />Save your money - the price to rent this turkey is outrageous.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Having an entire season available, without commercials, is the best way to view programs, especially one such as The Good Wife.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Love Arnold - his movies are always fun to watch!<br />Everyone seems to think that this actor is too old - he did a great job in this movie.
0316044695|5.0|I have read this novel along with Service at least 6 times, each time finding more out about these incrediable service men and women. The mortifying circumstances our military faces everyday, requires bravery, honor,and a strong ability to make quick decisions. In my eyes and opinion a sense of humour is needed when most people would close their eyes and hope for a quick death. People have laid into Marcus for having a sense of humour while facing horrid conditions and the deaths of his Seal brothers. That kept him-and me as a reader, able to understand and prepare for the worse, and pray for the best. Hurah Marcus. GREAT JOB! And thank you God- for one more day.....
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Opened the box and was up and running in 3 minutes.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />- Kingston advertises 3 users simultaneously streaming, so far i've been able to stream across 5 devices (3 iPads, 1 iPhone, and 1 Macbook) using the MobileLite app as well as HTTP. Streaming 3 movies encoded as 720p M4V files. Can probably have more devices. Perhaps they upgraded the firmware to support more. Would have tried more, but ran out of devices to attach to the network.<br />- MobileLite app is very easy to use and settings are well labeled.<br />- Web interface by going to 192.168.200.254 very simple and easy to navigate.
B000093BDX|5.0|My mom loves the beach boys but never owned any of their albums so I surprised her with this 'best of' CD. To say the least, she loves it. She listens to it while she cooks, cleans, or when she just wants to rock out or feel nostalgic. I'm in my 20s and even I like some of the songs. If you're a beach boys fan, I think you'de like this.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|We really enjoyed Shaun the Sheep when it was on Disney channel. I was excited to find this under the Amazon Prime videos for our Kindle Fire.

0875428940|4.0|This was the first Tarot card deck I picked up to work with, so I must admit to a certain fondness for it.  I have since gone on to buy many other decks, but this remains my Go To deck for those occasions when I am reading for people in a public situation or for those who are a bit skittish about getting a tarot reading in the first place.  This is a very non-threatening deck in that regard, both in most of the artwork and in how it comes across when you read it.  Or at least in how I read it.<br /><br />The artwork has a certain paganish flavor to it and you can't escape that, but if you want to buy it as a pagan or for a pagan that is a definite plus.  The general meaning of the cards is, of course, based off of Rider-Waite, which is pretty standard for most Tarot decks.  This deck works and plays well with most patterns you might want to lay out and can address life circumstances of all kinds (unlike some decks which seem more geared to specifically spiritual pursuits).<br /><br />As a beginner's deck this is a good one to think about getting, especially if you are Wiccan or pagan.
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|Henery Fonda, Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale ALL with great preformances. The opening with Jack Elam just got this GREAT MOVIE off to a good start. Sergio Leone film's are always the BEST, if YOU have NOT seen this one, BUY it, worth seeing, and having it in your collection.  My personal WESTERN favoriate is The WILD BUNCH.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|One of his best yet..I am a big fan so maybe that's why, but really is wonderful and well worth the price.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Another GREAT preformace by Russell Crowe. I enjoy every movie with him in it. Movies done in this era are special to me, people that go to sea in ships powered by wind, and made from WOOD, are brave people. Buy this one, it's a good one.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I've lost over 50 lbs using the knowledge laid out in this book. It is written simply yet convincingly, and should be on anyones reading list who has ever struggled with excess weight.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I like the game. Its so interesting, funny and very challenging.  I hope i can resolve as many are necessary to unlock new stages.
B00821OX98|4.0|Over all very entertaining. It seems to start off a bit slow but really begins to pick up speed as the characters get fleshed out. If your a Sci-Fi fan and looking for a new series its worth checking out.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is a production of Les Mis that truly captures the grandeur of this great musical.  The voices are magnificent and the story inspirational.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I was sceptical about this app actually working, but it has helped and it does show when the decive is charging. It might charge all night, but atleast it charges.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|I'm a fan of Lee Childs' series of novels about ex-military policeman Jack Reacher, enough of one to have been really angry when Tom Cruise maneuvered himself into the lead role in the first movie made from any of the books. And I've read them all, every one of them. I'll buy the next one when it comes out.<br /><br />But this is by far -- by FAR -- the weakest of the entire series. The reason is because in it, Childs stopped being a storyteller and became a preacher.<br /><br />Mostly he preaches left-wing politics against the American involvement in Iraq.<br /><br />But he spares quite a bit of shallow and mean-spirited mockery for Christians and, basically, anyone religious.<br /><br />I don't know or care if that's \\"Jack Reacher\\" the character talking, or Lee Childs, the character's creator. It's off-putting and a waste of my money, and it diverts energy and focus from the fiction. And frankly, the story is the least believable of any in the entire series, and that's saying something. To swallow this whopper, you have to pretend that the U.S. government, post-9/11, has decided to treat its own feedstocks for WMDs with about the same care as it treats left-over pencil shavings.<br /><br />If you're going to skip one in the series, this would be an excellent choice. I wish I'd skipped it, frankly. The author should withdraw this version and fix it before reissuing it.

B008JFUMDS|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br />Tale about 4 magicians who are recruited by someone wearing a hoodie.  A year later they have a magic show in Las Vegas where they appear to rob a bank in Paris.<br /><br />The magicians are held for 48 hours and then released as it can not be proved what they did. Morgan Freeman is a guy that debunks tricks, he is brought in to explain what they did.  For a while Michael Caine sponsors the magicians.<br /><br />Next they go to New Orleans where they again do an unbelievable trick, then they run away and the story focuses on the policeman and a gal from INTERPOL who aspire to figure out what is going on.<br /><br />A final trick is done in NYC. It turns out then the whole thing was set up so a person could get back at somebody for revenge. A plot as convoluted as [[ASIN:B002Q6O6S8 Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]. At times we get flashbacks to explain how things occured.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft p.e is a great way to bring a tablet version of maby your favourite compute game in your pocket. This is very addicting to play..So I warn you.............
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Didn't mean to, but I went into watching OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL with a semi-closed mind, after reading review after review citing the bad casting of James Franco (even though I am rabid for Franco; love the guy!).  Sure enough, Franco was, indeed, a bad casting choice for the lead role ... but, to me, even worse was Mila Kunis as Theodora/the Wicked Witch of the West.  Margaret Hamilton set a DAMNED high bar for the role, and Kunis never comes off as menacing/wicked enough.  Hell, even her slighter height, toward the end when Theodora is playing side-by-side with wicked sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz, who is wonderfully evil), completely diminishes the power of the character.<br /><br />That's the negative; the positive is the 'Oz the Great and Powerful' is freaking BEAUTIFUL to look at.  Director Sam Raimi has infused the film with all the color, majesty, and eye candy needed to pay homage to 'The Wizard of Oz' classic - and much as I hate to admit it, Michelle Williams (not perfect, but good), Zach Braff (even voicing the winged monkey Finley, Tony Cox (who can convey more sardonic wit with one look than many actors can do with dialogue), and the rest of the supporting cast make the movie enjoyable ... even fun.  Franco isn't THAT bad in the role, especially as Oz gains his footing and goes from con man/magician to realizing his destiny, but through the entire picture he just feels ... off.  Like a framed painting hanging just slightly crooked on the wall, that never seems quite straight no matter what you do.<br /><br />Worth seeing?  Definitely.  And kids will love it (though it may be too intense for the younger ones; the Wicked Witch's evil monkeys, fairly vicious in appearance, fly right into the camera a few times, thanks to the film's being shot in 3D).  You just may leave with the thought that it might have been so much more ...
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the long awaited finale of this series. Well worth the wait. Heartily recommend this title and the previous two Wheel of Time books by Sanderson.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|It took something like 72 years for Dustin Hoffman to direct his first film, but he did beautifully with his first one; QUARTET is a lovingly-made film, absolutely beautiful to look at, about a home for retired classical musicians and opera singers preparing for their yearly tribute concert to Verdi ... when a new resident - opera diva Jean Horton (the incomparable Maggie Smith) - moves in, disrupting the tranquil lives of three of the residents (including her ex-husband) who used to sing with her.<br /><br />Funny, touching, but never pandering to a bunch of old-age stereotypes, the film's location shooting in the English countryside, in a beautiful old manor house, sets the perfect mood - and the performances of the four leads (Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, and the brilliant and charming Pauline Collins), as you learn more of their characters and their relationships with each other, makes for a sweet ride. A terrific film, and if you see it please make sure to watch through the end credits - where you will be treated to images of the real-life supporting players, many of them real-life musicians or singers, alongside photos of them in their heyday. Dustin, you did a way-cool job.
B0093ST02E|4.0|Food for thought and some uncomfortable situations, but entertaining and I felt like I was spying on a young couple.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Finally, after all of these months of waiting...  As a huge fan of this series I can honestly say it was well worth the wait.  Sylvia Day did not disappoint.  For me this was by far the best in the series.  So many revelations, questions answered and truths revealed.  The story flowed and progressed as it should.  Door closed but others opened leading us into the 4th and 5th books of the Crossfire series.<br /><br />The reasons I loved this book:<br /><br />-Gideon and Eva actually worked on their relationship.  None of the jealousy that we saw in books 1 and 2.  They matured as a couple and although they are dysfunctional as a couple they are made for each other.  They reached a whole new level of intimacy that I have never seen in any book I have read...Hint, Chapter 18.<br /><br />-More characters are brought into the storyline making more pieces of the story fall into place.<br />The sex scenes were off the charts HOT!!  As hot as the scenes were, for the first time they didn't use sex as a distraction for their other issues.  They actually talked their trouble out, it was refreshing.<br /><br />-Gideon Cross - the ultimate alpha male.  There was a shift in the roles between Eva and Gideon.  In this book, she was the aggressor and more in control.  Gideon opened up to Eva about his past and feelings.  He basically admitted to Eva that she owned him body and soul.<br /><br />My favorite character: Eva<br /><br />She really came into her own in EWY.  She was more aggressive, assertive, blunt and together.  She stepped up business wise and even though she was dealing with a lot personally she didn't cave.  She showed strength and determination without Gideon as her crutch.<br /><br />I understand there were a lot of bad reviews, but this cannot be based on the writing or the storyline.  My understanding is that people are upset with the ending, but one has to realize there are two more books to go in this series.  The author had no control over the release dates ofthe first 3 books but it is my understanding she will self publish the last two books in the series.<br /><br />There is still a lot more in the series and I am sure the author will tie up any loose ends, but I personally loved this one from beginning to end and as a true fan to the series look forward to more Gideon and Eva!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Whenever I play with my sister via multiplayer, it does not save my stuff, and I found 23 diamond so I am ticked off
0425263924|2.0|Yet again an author succumbs to stretching out a story to make more money when its not even necessary and leaves fans offended. This third installment in the Crossfire Series was drawn out with not much happening to warrant one or even two more books to be released in the future. Waiting this long for a conclusion and then receiving this yawn story begs for a refund. I am so angry with this author I refuse to purchase anymore books by her I will just end Eva and Gideons romance in my mind with a HEA.

B00009RAJH|5.0|This was the 1975 recording debut of the definitive incarnation of Fleetwood Mac which within two years of its inception became a global phenomenon. The remnants of Peter Green's original British blues band - the rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, plus McVie's talented singer-songwriter-pianist wife, Christine - recruited two relatively unknown Californians, guitarist-composer Lindsey Buckingham and his girlfriend, enigmatic singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks to join the party.<br /><br />The resulting sound from the new Anglo-American 5-piece was radically different to FM's previous work, more pop-rock than R&B and the better for it. `Say you love me' and `Rhiannon' were hit singles, and there isn't one weak track or filler among the remaining numbers. Buckingham's upbeat rocker `Monday Morning', McVie's soulful composition `Warm Ways' and `Landslide' by Nicks are all classic tracks which still sound good, almost 40 years later.<br /><br />The 2003 remix has 5 bonus tracks in addition to the original 11. `Jam #2' is an instrumental, and the remaining 4 are punchier, shortened `single' versions of the original album tracks.<br /><br />If you've heard this band's famous follow-up album `Rumours' (considered by many to be the greatest pop-rock album of all time) and like it but don't know this earlier release, give it a listen. It's actually just as good as `Rumours' (well, almost) and in the same groove.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|not much to say other then I was sorry that I got swept up in the must read hip.  Book is garbage, poorly written and subject mater is not to my taste<br />Not recomended.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Not just a saga.  This is the story of how one Marine finds courage and freedom in the middle of chaos.  Acting is excellent.  Characters are believable.  Not a John Wayne kind of military movie, but rather is a story of how a thoughtful, sensitive guy in the Marines is able to mature in the midst of the irrational, the grotesque and the seemingly immoral world in which he has placed himself.  This is not an anti-war film - nor is it a pro-war film.  This is all about how this Marine copes and eventually triumphs.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Not exactly what I had expected. Was way more basic than I thought that it would be. Could have been better.

I had very low expectations for it but it was a beautiful game with nice music. Some levels pissed me off more than others but that's ok. Just finished the game last week... doesn't really have a replay value so it'll be one of the first games to go if I need more room.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story!  Really well written!  Colleen Hoover is a great author!  I've read all 3 of her. Books, and am really hoping she will release another one really soon!!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Ever since I discovered the TED Talks, I've wanted to attend a conference. Lots of interesting subjects, both funny and serious.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I got this alarm because I needed something easy to use but that would work well. My fianc&eacute; downloaded this because he thought it would be perfect...and it is! It is so customizable and easy to use and it w works great. Love this and would definitely recommend it.
0307730700|5.0|Changed my life, no matter how messed up things get, you can overcome you obstacles with dedication, hope and special folks.  Rest in peace.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I feel so cheated and ripped off.  I returned this book and that is something that I have never done.  After having my hopes up for months, this is what she goes and does.  Are you SERIOUS??????  You ruined such a beautiful start and there was not much of a story at all to this book.  The author answered about three of the questions that were left over from book two, but that could have been a three page story.  I love Sylvia Day, but for $9.99, she should be a shamed of herself.  It was like she did not even write the book, like a child wrote it our something.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|well organized plot.  great character development.  parts of the story get a little drawn out.  this isn't a book I could read read in a single sitting.  it just isn't that great.  that being said,  it is still a great story.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I often use this while I'm writing. I love the \\"The Right Word\\" sections! They're so helpful! One of the most useful books ever.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I enjoyed this film although it is slow in parts. There are many different themes in the film that can be explored for discussion in the classroom. I think the title says it all. Who was the untouchable, the caregiver-Driss, or the invalid -Phillipe?  Great movie. A testimony that all people can be saved and changed if they choose to be.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|What a great game!!! I am so glad I downloaded this game!! They do look like jello like everybody says...  d=(^o^)=b I love it I give i 2 thumbs up  YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Pollan makes it clear that cooking, as opposed to reheating, is the missing link in sustainable agriculture, written as always in his accessible, stealth-educational style.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game very fun to p l at for kids banks adults who are not allowed the drawing on the drawing board members of the over night we should be able to Book
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This is Paul in his absolute prime.  His voice seems to do whatever he wants it to.  On Blackbird he is melodic and smooth.  On Call me back again, he is &#34;perfectly raspy&#34;  Overall, the recording is very clean considering it was made in 1976.  Substandard stereo speakers systems will be knocked offline by the bass in the opening of Letting go.  The band is solid and most importantly, they appear to be having a ball!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|good stuff , very well made . Just like a 30 hr movie with all three seasons . Couldn't wait for next episode , watched first season straight through . can't wait to watch it again
B003XDVVO0|5.0|they're cute and comfortable. she's on her feet all day at work and crocs have always been the most comfortable shoes for her.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This album literally sky rocketed Pop Punk into the mainstream of America and all around the world. Definitely a must buy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome.....keep the updates coming.....does anyone know when 0.8.0 is coming out??  please tell me!!!! Minecraft rocks!!!!! I love 0.7.1
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|This is an excellent PDK book, with a lot of detail and profound retro-futuristic detail. A very satisfying read indeed.
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|First of all, to those who complain about the fact that this soundtrack isn't &#34;in tune&#34; with the '20s: It's not supposed to be. Check the iTunes description of it; it specifically says it's supposed to be modern, with a kind of '20s throwback feel.<br /><br />All of the songs on this soundtrack are haunting and beautiful. Personally, I'm obsessed with Beyonce's and Andre 3000's rendition of &#34;Back to Black&#34; and Lana del Rey's &#34;Young and Beautiful.&#34; This soundtrack's been on replay since I got it.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I've got to admit that when you first hear about the Fast Diet it sounds like just another fad diet. But after reading the book, watching the documentary and understanding the science behind it I realise that it's not just a diet, it's a lifestyle change... and it's one that could just save your life! I've been doing the Fast Diet for five weeks now and have lost the last 4 kilos of really hard to shift post pregnancy weight. In fact I'm now about half a kilo under my pre-pregnancy weight and I've been eating chips, pizza, fudge, etc. The first three fast days were a challenge but it gets easier and easier until I actually find myself looking forward to my next fast day! I intend to stay on the fast diet in the maintenance mode once I reach my new goal weight and body shape so that I can not only have my cake and eat it too but also reap the other health benefits from the twice weekly fasts.
B00866H7SS|5.0|I have read this book twice now, once nearly a year ago and again so I can read the third in the series, and I still couldn't put it down the second time. The emotions a raw, the sexy scenes are hot and the story is intriguing. I love the way Gideon and Eva work together discovering themselves together. A fantastic story that I couldn't put down even the second time around.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I've been thru all the screens twice and the game just keeps going and going.  So after a million points, I deleted the game and have started over.  I enjoy the graphics and the screens get progressively harder, but if you have gotten enough lifelines (the red hearts), you get to do do-overs and keep racking up the points and continue on.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|The CD make it just fine. The wifey loves it so thats all I have to say. Good stuff. thanks
B001EBROWQ|4.0|By today's movie standards this movie does seem a little cheesy, but still a great story compacted into one movie.
B005KELW26|5.0|My new Kindle Fire fits perfectly in this cute cover.  The purple cover is a bonus.  I like the side pocket on the inside flap and find that I can also prop this cover into a tent so that my Kindle stands alone. This is a terrific product.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very good and informative application. No need for additional app, in my opinion. You get exactly the information you need.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love all the big money, power ups,  and most of all winning the game itself.fun to play and watch people compete
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though I am not particularly interested in surfing. It' s worth a watch for the stunning photography alone. The fact that it was based on a true story of an obviously superbly talented and much-loved young man, Jay Moriarty, made it all the more moving. Totally inspirational. Great acting from all concerned.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am so disappointed with this book. Now to hear she is gonna try to add two more books now we know its all about making money. I wanted a great ending and got left hanging. Now I'm an even bigger 50 shades fan'
1401216676|5.0|its really nice worth every penny. if you are a joker fan like me buy this now even if you are a batman
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first Wool story was haunting, the second - thoughtful, the third - exciting, the fourth - illuminating and the fifth was oh so satisfying.<br /><br />This is one of the best science fiction series EVER! Right up there with Assimov's Foundation!
1476715904|5.0|Slammed was such an unexpected surprised for me. I was expecting a book that simply held my attention and that I could finish while saying that it was pretty good. Instead I got a book that made me smile, laugh, and cry; it's a book that left me reeling and in serious need of a hug.<br /><br />Lake, is 18 years old and in her last year of high school. She's lost her father, but has had a few months to pick up the pieces and now she's dealing with moving to a new town. She certainly wasn't expecting to having feelings for a guy so quickly and I think it's safe to say that neither of us were expecting the whirlwind of emotion that followed after. I can't even gush and go into detail, because it's something you need to read for yourself. Will Cooper is sweet and supportive guy with a lot on his plate...and did I mention he's a poet? Yeah. Are you swooning yet? I am, give me poet any day. If you couldn't guess part of the book revolves around slam poetry, which revolves around performance as well. So I was uncertain how that was going to translate in book form, but Hoover manages to make it dynamic and emotional just like it's supposed to be. So emotional that I had pause several times just so I could collect myself. Eddie, who promptly makes herself Lake's new best friend, is a relaxed ball of fun. At first I was a bit putt off by her personality, because it's kind of there all at once but she's hard to dislike. She's intuitive, a great listener, and she seems like the sort of person who would stick by a person no matter what difficulties.<br /><br />The overall story is rather short and also rather addictive. I blazed through this in one sitting. I did have one single complaint and that was how quickly the romance began, it was so close to \\"insta-love\\"...but I have to say that compared to the overall plot it's not that big a deal.<br /><br />If I'm being honest, I'm having a really hard time even describing how much I enjoyed this book. It's rare that a book leaves me vulnerable. I'm not a crier, the last time a book left me wanting to bawl was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There are books that make me choke up slightly, but not very many that bring actual tears. Even though this book broke my heart at times it also had me feeling warm about the relationships in it. If you haven't read this and you're looking for a New Adult novel to read I completely recommend it.vulnerable.

B00024I2Z4|3.0|I had to get this because I need all the princesses in my collection. It is not a personal favorite. It is a dark movie with war and killing and Mulan is technically a transexual! I don't want my kid to get the wrong message this one will go on the shelf out of reach. The movie is not that good I watched it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Robie, a paid U.S. CIA-type killer fails a mission because it doesn't make sense to him.  He generally follows orders but this one is on US soil and doesn't feel right.  Thus begins a journey into self realization and a need to help someone else. All the pieces of the puzzle finally come together for him and he finally gets the man behind the setup.  Well written, even if you wanted to smack Robie a few times to get him back in the game.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This is a classic movie that every disney owner needs to have in their collection. I was a little worried about the whole &#34;flying&#34; thing with the kids but no problems!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Just a cool movie. You must hate life in general if your heart cannot be warmed by this movie. Can't wait to see II.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is totally addictive and challenging, yet simple enough for a kid. You just have to look at the puzzle and use your brain to get the 2 end points to meet. LOL
B006YC74E8|5.0|You can play with the pictures and have lots of great images. I really recommend this app to anyone. Thanks.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|DragonVale is a lot of fun, great graphics. The only thing that would make it better is if I could get the app for my computer.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I purchase this cable to be able to seek my kindle and netflix on the big screen.  It works great and so easy to install  I am able to also browse the Internet  and listen to my music through the speakers of my surround sound.  I love it  Greet buy
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in You is a great follow up to Bared To You, a nice continuation of a story that to be totally honest, I wasn't sure could be saved in my mind.  I think when you have the kind of damage that Eva & Gideon suffer from, there are bound to be things that you can't get past.  I just didn't see how these two people could end up together.<br /><br />I still have some issues with the families on both sides.  Eva's mother is out of control.  Everything is about her, and how it affects her and so on.  It is rather shameful that a parent is so self involved that a child has to make excuses to themselves about their bad behavior.  Eva walking on eggshells when she should have told her mom to jump off a cliff is one of my annoyances in this book.  Gideon's mother is no better.  To ignore your child's pain because it is inconvenient for you is so beyond wrong, it should come with a jail sentence.<br /><br />We see Corrine in this novel as well, and truth be told, I really want bad things to happen to her.  She is not the nice sweet woman from the first novel that I sorta felt bad for.  She is manipulative and mean and quite frankly, unlikeable.  But then again this seems to be a pattern for Gideon.  He is a bit more crazy than the first book, but you can understand towards the end of the book as to why.<br /><br />Eva bothered me a lot in this novel too.  Up to a point I thought she was a bit whiney and childish.  Then I started to see things through her point of view and I know I would not have handled seeing my boyfriend with his evil ex very well either.  She actually showed amazing poise.  But her confronting everyone in Gideon's life made me both cringe and cheer for her.<br /><br />I keep hearing the comparisons of the Crossfire series to the Fifty Shades series, and complain all you want, but there are a lot of similarities.  Will I say the Crossfire series is better written and more thought out, of course.  But don't get bent when people compare them, they ARE pretty damn close...<br /><br />This book was a bit better.  I will read Entwined with You now....<br /><br />I give this 4 lipsticks.retty damn close...<br /><br />This book was a bit better.  I will read Entwined with You now....<br /><br />I give this 4 lipsticks.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a sweet story, with oddly and creatively crafted characters.  Some very funny writing had me laughing out loud a few times, and though the bow was a big too perfectly tied at the end, it was a fun little journey.  The perfect book for my long plane flight.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My brother, husband, and I spent weekend competing using 2 tablets to see who made the best vehicle and got the most points on each stage. It was a blast!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! Everyone can play it even my 4 yr old son, we have a blast. All the upgrades and different characters will keep you interested!!!!!!!! Great! 5 stars!!!!!!!!!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Words can't reach feelings that Fringe give us.<br />What a wonderful series! Science, Action, Parallel Universes, Breaktroughs... Recommend for all.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|What can you say??? Galaxy Quest ROCKS! Great movie, underrated, all that jazz.<br /><br />It's a steal on Blu-ray too. Don't you miss it!!!
B00138D3VQ|5.0|Queen's first four albums were the best in my opinion. Definitely worth buying.<br />.Gotta fill more words for this review
B006DHAT5K|4.0|This comedy is very predictable and is like your average sex/ romantic/ comedy. This movie needed a little more surprises along the way and a little more comedy.
B004ZKL8VQ|5.0|Queen's first four albums were the best in my opinion. Definitely worth buying.<br />.Gotta fill more words for this review
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|There is something about Gideon and Eva that keeps me engrossed from page to page. I've been waiting for this book to come out for months and I read it way to fast....now I have to wait again!  Worth every minute.
0321687299|5.0|I picked up this book before the HTML 5 programmers were really on top of it. It has since been updated. Loved how it's written. It arrived within a week. The author is someone whose work I would use again.
B00BU0L882|5.0|i don't understand why there are bad reviews, i loved it, i don't even have words to describe it, you just have to see it for yourself, I vote a must watch, and the letter D was one of my favorites!!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This movie was better than I expected,  there was three generations who saw this movie and we all really enjoyed it;  my grand daughter love it so much she wanted to see the original well done
B0027MJU00|4.0|Synopsis:<br /><br />As the lone survivor of the night when most of her family had been murdered and her brother convicted of the crime, Libby Day grew up feeling as though something bad lived insider of her that was as real as any of her organs. The feeling of \\"being bad\\" consumed her, creating her own world where she needed nothing or no one normal. She stayed isolated from the real world until she was forced to find a way to support herself financially. In a bid to capitalize on the uniqueness of her situation, Libby decides to charge those interested in her family's turbulent history and strikes out on her sort of investigation. She follows where the leads take her until she reaches what could very well be her own \\"dead\\" end.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />It took me a few chapters to catch onto how the story was being told. Once I found my groove, the story took hold of me and I was pulled along for the ride. The story is told by the point of view of several characters including the main character, Libby, and various other family members. Each chapter begins by naming the POV character, date and time in which the chapter took place. That bit of information made it easier to keep track of where I was taken in the story.<br /><br />Overall, I loved how the story kept me guessing up to nearly the very end. There was plenty of evidence to convict any number of suspects put forth in the story but the ending wasn't exactly what I had pictured. As each layer of the investigation was examined, a new set of questions would spring up and lead the reader in an entirely different direction. I was also impressed by the author's ability to capture the essence of the \\"Satanic panic\\" that took place within the late 1980's. Being a child during that time period, I remember being instructed on what to watch for very well. If you like mysteries with several twists and turns to keep you guessing, this is definitely a book for you.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Ms. Singh deserves a genre of her own.  I never know if this is fantasy, urban fantasy, paranormal romance, or science fiction.  That is the magic.  The world building, a skill that is lacking in so many series (many TOP series), is lush and vibrant and nearly tactile from Ms. Singh. She is a master of managing a large cast of characters without slighting anyone.  That said, this book is pretty much all Kaleb and Sahara.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*We finally get to see who and what Kaleb is.  Ms. Singh did him justice which is tricky because the man and the situations (victimized mate) are so much like Judd and she could have just taken a pass and regurgitated the same character traits and mannerisms.  Thank you, Ms Singh for not dragging us back through the dissonance business.  Kaleb shows us supreme control doesn't have to be silent.<br /><br />*I didn't have to see the phrase \\"dominant predatory changeling male\\" a million times, though I love them.  I think this is not so noticeable when reading but when you get the audible versions it is enough to make you nuts.  My point, we needed to change venues so to speak and finally see this war from the inside, from THE Psy.<br /><br />*We finally are done with the Pure Psy arc, hopefully.  I am ready for Ming's reckoning.<br /><br />*Arrow Squad goodness.  I love Aden.  Hopefully he will be our next hero.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Sahara.  Don't get me wrong, the cons on a Nalini Singh book are better than most authors can come up with.  Sahara was more interesting as a young child/girl in flashback than she in adulthood.  My problem with Sahara was not her acquiescence, it was necessary because Kaleb needed a mate who would accept him broken and ruthless.  My issues were more about her power.  The importance seems contrived to bring her up to a level that would mean something against Kaleb.  It seemed like a good deal of \\"oooh ahhhh\\" for nothing special.  I do love Sahara and it works, just nit picking.  Let's be honest, if Anita Blake was half as well developed as Sahara I wouldn't have stopped reading her series at book 5.<br /><br />* I miss the wolves and I wanted to see a more pregnant Mercy dealing with Riley.<br /><br />All in all, the fact I read it in less than 24 hours should tell you it is everything it needed to be.e honest, if Anita Blake was half as well developed as Sahara I wouldn't have stopped reading her series at book 5.<br /><br />* I miss the wolves and I wanted to see a more pregnant Mercy dealing with Riley.<br /><br />All in all, the fact I read it in less than 24 hours should tell you it is everything it needed to be.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Most 20th century concentration camp testimonials, at their core, are about a state's agenda of genocide. North Korea shunned whole sale murder and combined the endless slave labor of the Gulag with the cruel, dehumanizing treatment endured in the Nazi death camps. This is the testimonial of Shin Dong-hyuk. Shin lived from birth until his early 20s completely isolated from the outside world inside Camp 14, a punitive slave labor camp. Shin's only 'crime' was being born the nephew of an 'enemy of the state'. Two of his uncles defected during the Korean war, 40 years before. Harden documents a fascinating and heart-rending tale of survival from the first page to the last.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|I would love if they had more free games like this one or at least similarly,and also I really got into this game but didn't get to far yet like I would like to.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is one of those rare books that will appeal to just about anyone, with the possible exception of an absolute cynic.  For someone with the scientific knowledge of brain disorders and diseases to be unable to explain away \\"hallucinations\\" or \\"raging fever dreams\\" speaks volumes to the validity of that experience.  I found some of the scientific knowledge a bit obtuse but was extremely impressed by his physician's statement at the end of the book.  I loved this book and will probably go back to it from time to time.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Super penguin is even better than temple run... it has one  obstacles an  is easy to control... u must get this game!
B001F6TXME|5.0|After reading the reviews for knock off remote releases, I noticed many complaints saying they don't work when the camera is in Live View mode, so I purchased this OEM release and am happy to say it works perfectly.<br /><br />If you need to use this when your camera's in Live View, definitely spend a few extra bucks to get this one right from Nikon.
B000P2A3WI|5.0|I bought this tablet edition just to have around for re-reads.The characters are compelling (a bit of stereotyping doesn't hurt them), and the book is just plain Funny. For some who have felt sad and helpless and near-suicidal, this book is a heck of a respite. Good job, and thank you NH.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I own every Megadeth album since the beginning, and while Super Collider isn't their best, it is still a damn good album!  With the lack of good hard rock/metal being released these days, this was a welcomed addition to my CD collection!  I have been listening to it since Tuesday and I have yet to get sick of it.<br /><br />I would guess that most Megadeth fans will actually enjoy the majority of these new songs, and they will not regret picking up this CD!<br /><br />All of the early negative reviews were really just cr*p!  You can't please everyone I guess.  If you like Megadeth, pick up the CD and enjoy the new Tunes!<br /><br />Long live ROCK!!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Does what you want and does it well. Great for travel. This has replaced my old alarm clock. I am a light sleeper and don't need a loud alarm, so I really like the alarm volume adjustment.

B001N3OJEG|5.0|I had watched this movies numerous times, on netflix, amazon prime etc.  I decided to get the blu ray because it was only a little over $10 and I knew I would go back and watch this again.<br />I like how the story was told and the acting was top notch.  Every scene, every conversation seemed to have purpose.  Action sequences were brief but explosive.  Movie was over two hours but every time after I watched it, I found myself thinking what would I watch next time that could best this movie.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Decent game. Now that is what I am talking about. I look for this type of game all the time and usually have a hard time fitting my standards.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I did not care for this book.  Loved the series and was really disappointed by the way the author chose to end it.  I seriously thought about not finishing it but went ahead and finished reading it.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|Displays a good message to little ones to never lose sight of who they are. To love and honor their parents as we all should. Most movies now a days do not send THAT particular message and I find it fundamentally important to learn and pass on by example.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard is one of my sheroes. She exhibits an inner strength and courage that is not found in many people, of any age, and she had to develop that strength when she was so heartbreakingly young.<br /><br />Everyone knows the basic details of Jaycee's story - she was kidnapped by a convicted rapist and his wife, brutally raped and abused for years, kept in a backyard compound where she bore two children and lived for 18 years, before some alert college campus cops figured out something was \\"off\\" about the two young girls that Phillip Garrido had brought with him to pitch his ?book? ?presentation?<br /><br />This is her sharing from the inside, as best she could remember, in many places with scraps of her own journals. What she felt, what she remembers, how she felt about it, later, after she recovered her name and life.<br /><br />It's raw, and very little editing was done. So for some people, that's a stumbling point. Knowing that Jaycee's education stopped at fifth grade, I think she did an amazing job.<br /><br />As she did with her daughters, who clearly she loves very much. There's an innate conflict there, because no matter how she feels about him, her rapist and kidnapper was their father. Someday (if they haven't already), her daughters may read what she had to say about him, about them and their life in that tented \\"compound.\\"<br /><br />18 years - I am not sure I would be still alive or sane after 18 years. She could so easily have taken her own life, or done/said the wrong thing and \\"made\\" that madman kill her, but she survived, and found pleasure in small things, in pets and her daughters and fought fiercely for their education, looking up lessons on the Internet and printing out worksheets.<br /><br />And if you wonder why she (or anyone) in a situation of domestic violence or captivity didn't run on the rare occasions she was allowed out in public, didn't try to send a message through the Internet, this memoir will help you understand.<br /><br />Emotionally it's a very difficult read in many places, but inspiring, too. If nothing else, I urge you to buy a copy to support Jaycee, whether you ever read it or not.Emotionally it's a very difficult read in many places, but inspiring, too.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept my interest, wondering what would happen next.  The author had a good grasp of both male, female and psychotic thought processes.  Wasn't expecting the ending.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|I watch the last 3 of the movies, first produced, a lot.  (Not fond of the first 3 later produced, even though they were by George Lucas himself.)  Wanted them in blu ray.  George Lucas is brilliant.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First of all, I love this book, despite the fact that the love story of Eva and Gideon will continue for awhile longer.  Sylvia is one of my favorite writers in this genre and if she feels she needs to continue this story for a few more books, more power to her!!  This book is my favorite so far!!  It has more romance and you can really see the growth of these characters.  I love plot twists and the fleshing out of some of the characters in Eva and Gideon s world.  Without that I think things could get boring over time.  My only hope is the wait for the next book won't be as long as it was for this book.  Though I will say it was worth waiting for!!  Thanks for another awesome book Sylvia!!
B007WPM4P0|1.0|I kept wanting to fast forward...I'm sure this meant I must have missed some really good parts. It just didn't capture my attention during the opening.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I know I have seen a lot of talk about how this book ends.  I was totally satisfied that Sookie finally ended up with someone who will appreciate her and take care of her.  Way to go Charlaine Harris!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|We watch this every Christmas Eve. The first musical number is brilliant. Michael Caine is exceptional, but isn't he always? I can't stand the singing bit when Scrooge is courting whats-her-name, but nothing is perfect. It gets overly sanguine for a Muppet production when Scrooge is with Christmas Future, but he is dead and everyone hates him, so exactly how do you take Dickens' concepts and make them more &#34;Muppety&#34;? Roll with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I love it!!! They have different editions so you can try www each version. If you like temple run you should get this game! The game has no viruses as far as I know. I would recommend it for all ages!! This game is worth and its free!!!!!!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I must have listened to this 100 times. I'm still not sure whether they are stretching music or pandering. They have a neat sound unlike most, however, &#34;is that Oasis&#34; pops up in my mind a lot. They write great songs, that I'm not wishy-washy about. I like it, but I just don't know why, and that might be the problem.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|You have got to be kidding me. We waited this long for this book just for it to have this sorry ending. I paid $9.99 for an unfinished book. You need to really give people a refund. This book was not worth the wait or the money. I will not be waiting on any more of this books. I am so pissed at the fact that this book just had a really sorry ending. The next book should be free to everyone who waited so long and purchased this book, such a waste of time and money.
B00136Q342|5.0|It's Johnny Cash at his best. This is especially good for me as I drive through the middle of nowhere Colorado on the way to the mountain house. Something about the emptiness and lack of people matches to his vibe.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Really good game, i love the co op dungeons, but the back pack really is way too small, i consistently encounter situations in which my bag is full
B001C3KCSY|4.0|Memory serves these guys slogged away recording and finally made it with this album when (of course) somebody outside the seemingly musically inept US &#34;found&#34; their work. They have a great rock country something sound.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was really nervous about buying this book after reading  the bad reviews. My friend really liked it sooo I went for it. I am in my 30s and yes there were many disturbing parts with him beating people that looked at her, but overall I loved it. Sometimes I felt toward the end it was being dragged out.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|Not like anything else you're going to hear. Well deserved of 2012 best new artist. I use Flume as my wake-up alarm.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game,  but they need the 7.0 alpha update the phone version has. they finally added buckets,  mineable red stone,  a better interface and chat.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|He's a talented guy with a guitar. Sounds like a lot of the umpteen guys with guitars around. I get a definite Dave Matthews vibe in half of it. Nothing wrong with any of that. I'd be much more interested to see what he could or would do if he wrote the whole thing himself and made it what he wanted it to be. I'm no music genius, but this reeks of record label mathematics. That is of course the point of American Idol, but I had no idea he had anything to do with that when I bought this. I don't follow that trite crap. All that said, when this comes up on the iPod my foot starts tapping.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I played it a lot on my computer until I was able to down load it onto my Kindle.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|Florence has such a great voice and I don't think this album does it justice. It is what I would call &#34;overly produced&#34;. I like all of it better live. That said, I like anyone better live. If you can't cut it without a bunch of manipulation after the fact, the go find another career. It's not as good as the first album, and smacks of &#34;let's bust out another one and make a bunch of money; probably more inspired by the record company than the artist.
B00992CF6W|5.0|They need to make a new update and hurry up and make it good add buckets and weather it would be awesome
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Crazy story and funny of driving because when you drive for the first time and the story starts off crazy
B00594XOZU|5.0|Good way to connect with others and not have to pay.this is just like texting but u don't have to pay
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is an excellent medium for keeping in touch with distant friends and family, but as far as a social media outlet's potential, it leaves much to be desired. especially since facebook added advertisements and the ability to message non friends, more and more spam/viruses have been being transmitted.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's a really fun game and it's cute! It's easy to get acorns and easy to play. I recommend it, if you like the ice age movies.
B00C391Y3I|4.0|Im a HUGE Priest fan but I thought this Blueray was just ok. It would have been better if KK was in it instead of the new guy. It kind of killed it for me :(<br /><br />Anyway, Priest is about the best metal band from the 80's, along with Iron Maiden! :)
B007704HO6|5.0|A must read for animal lovers. This kitty chaged the guy's life forever. But now James is donating for animal shelters on behalf of Bob. What a great couple.
B0044RFT8S|4.0|My daughter loved the second two moves but for some reason, you cannot get this fist one on apple tv or Netflix or anything. I bought this for her birthday party, and everyone had a blast. This is a great series of films and we have loved each one equally.
0345525558|3.0|This book was a book group pick and I would not recommend it for other book groups.  The character development was weak, the main character totally unbelievable and the topic of foster care, which was the premise of the book, was not even addressed.  Try as I might I could not like a single character in this entire book and was very disappointed in the plot which was pretty non-existent throughout the novel.  In all honesty I have no idea what we will discuss other than the fact that the main character is a selfish, immature brat.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's actually 3D  another addicting game. I  Would recommend this action game to anyone who likes action games.  Love it.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Who wouldn't love Annie? This is a story which families can watch together. Even young children understand and sympathize with the girls and especially Annie. Musicals are so much fun and this one is one of the best!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The characters seam to have lost their personality trades. Not enough continuity with the two previous books. Goes in too many directions without a clear point.
076781326X|5.0|I loved the music and also the characters. The story is a classic and this version is very well done.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|If you have made it this far in to the franchise then you are a fan and my review isn't really necessary!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a charming story with great settings, characters, and story line. I have watched it so many times that I almost know it by heart. The sex scenes and sex discussions make it an adult movie. It is not for children. I love the actors chosen for the various roles the movie provides.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|be careful paying for credits bingo blitz does not take any responsibility and amazon will help on the first complaint but you will have to wait up to 3 weeks to get any refunds after that. it is a great game but not when you are losing money.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|How much fun is it to draw your own character and have him animated as your player? I really liked this game and played through it multiple times with different characters.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|cannot believe some people finish a single game so quickly!<br />Great fun for when you have down time. A lot of different tile arrangements to play!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Got this as the FAOTD and spent countless hours on it. It combines the best of all mobile games: gravity/physics/construction, puzzle, and good music and story. Get it!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It is different enough from Angry Birds to keep you wanting to play.<br />Building some of the vehicles really takes some thought!
B0085YOD1A|2.0|I am Not sure at this app is working properly. I just installed it on my Droid Razr Maxx and have 89 percent free. The app is reporting 7 minutes left?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was SO not prepared to see the book end....it was like someone just put in a book mark and shut the book.  Frustrating! Lol! 😡😱😍
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a fun game.  Hand eye coordination is a must!  hahahahahaha...It's not as easy as it looks.  Have fun!
B009R659L8|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone!  It has a lot of twists and turns and kept me glued til I finished it in one day.  Of course, by about three quarters into it, I had it figured it out.  I still enjoyed it and found that Hannah and Kate to be remarkable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this site! I can literally stay on it for hours looking up new things. I recommend it to anyone really. There is a little something for everyone
B00AG297GK|5.0|The mans Best work, Amazing how he put america in perspective twoards the end funny cause its true lol watch it
B000HL09SA|5.0|I purchased this movie for my grandson, due in August, who will be welcomed into a family with a &#34;big brother&#34;, Charlie, the German Shepherd. I'm sure he will enjoy it as much as I do, and will bond with his pal, just as Willie and Skip bonded.
0425263991|5.0|Nalini's new release, Heart of Obsidian has finally arrived!!!  Being a romance reader for over 20 years now, Nalini first captured my attention when she wrote Desert Warrior.  I remember thinking at the time, that I need to keep an eye out for the next books written for her.  Every single book she has written I have anxiously awaited as she has kept me enthralled with every book she writes.  For the Psy-Changeling series, the fact that she has been able to keep a series going for 12 books with a central conflict going throughout and strong characters who make me fall in love all over again is nothing short of amazing.  Heart of Obsidian does not disappoint.  So many pieces of the puzzle come together regarding whether Kaleb is a good or bad, who is the Ghost, who will fall and who will rise during the civil war of the Psy.  I'm hungry for more, what am I going to do for the next 10 months or so before the next one comes out? Guess I'll have to start reading this one over again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jet pack two is a rip of.with this this games alot better<br /> I would give this a 100 star if it was up to me
B0070UFMOW|5.0|This is a great solution for anyone who wants that HiFi sound on the go.<br /><br />The unit comes with a bunch of accessories for it to allow it to hook to whatever media player you wish. There are 4 sticky rubber pads you place on the unit itself so it doesnt slide and doesnt damage the back of the unit when you place it somewhere.<br /><br />It also comes with 2 rubber band like holders to hold this unit to the music player of your choice. Makes a strong connection, these things are not flimsy. Currently run with the ipod connector and the FIIO USB DAC with an ipod touch. The rubber &#34;bands&#34; get in the way of the screen somewhat, however its not a big deal to me, they move easily enough and keep the ipod touch secure to the DAC.<br /><br />Not bad at all, and paired with the desktop mount I also have a high fidelity source for editing music as well. Good stuff
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just read it for the 3rd time and still love it.<br />Can't wait for the movie in November with Harrison Ford.<br />Check out Ender's Shadow as well for the same story from a different perspective.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I was happy to have a version to play on my Blu-ray, but was unhappy that it wasn't the original movie I saw in theaters. I have the Trilogy on vhs which is the same as the original movie in theaters.  I must have missed that when reading the reviews.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is colorful and you get to go to different places. My brother loves this game and he always asks me if he can get on my Kindle Fire to play Subway Sitters. Thank you Amazon fir making this a fun and free app.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Honestly, with every book Gideon Cross just gets more sexy and I just love him more and more.  Ms. Day seems to set the bar higher with each installment of this series.  I am SO not one of those people who is upset that the story isn't over after this book.  I want so many more books about Gideon that she could just continue this series forever and I would be a happy camper!  I also read one review that was upset that it was a cliffhanger.  It's not a cliffhanger, in fact it almost could have been the final book in the series if not for the fact that some story lines were left open or started.<br /><br />So in my review of Reflected in You I mentioned that I hoped we saw more of Victor, Eva's dad.  Boy did we see more of him in this book!  He is such a sweet man and he really is a wonderful father.  It was devastating to him to learn what happened to Eva when she was younger, although I have to say that I am not totally on board with how he dealt with it.  Eva's mother is the same as ever, controlling and constantly sticking her nose in where it doesn't belong.  While it's clear that she has Eva's best interests at heart she has a really bad way of inserting herself into Eva's business and that causes problems for them once again.<br /><br />Cary played a decent part in this book, but not as much as the last one.  There was a major step in his story line that we will see playing out in the next books.  He's still very much a part of Eva's life and looks to be for some time.  She did keep a lot of things from him throughout the course of this book.  He's upset with her and understandably so, but they will work through it, they always do.  I think that everyone needs a friend like Cary!<br /><br />I liked Eva so much better in this book.  She still has some work to do, but she isn't running at the first sign of conflict anymore.  I think she finally realizes that Gideon loves only her and that he isn't going anywhere.  I think he pretty much proved how much he loves her in the last book.  They are still dealing with the ramifications of that and will be for some time.  They took their relationship to a whole new level in this book and I am so anxious to see how it progresses in the next 2 books.  I just hope we don't have to wait too long for the next book.<br /><br />Ms. Day seems to take each book to the next level when it comes to her love scenes as well.  If you thought that that last book was sexy, it has nothing on this one.  There are some scenes in this book that will have you blushing, no doubt and one in particular that I sure didn't see coming.  There is a fair amount of profanity in this book like there was in the others, some is vulgar, but not used in a derogatory way.  If you don't like detailed love scenes then you probably want to take a pass on this series.er in the last book.  They are still dealing with the ramifications of that and will be for some time.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I like books with an Irish setting.  Christina McKenna knows these people and brings them to life beautifully.  The story is amazing, and it grabs your heart without being &#34;sappy.&#34;  I will definitely be looking for more of her books.<br />All thumbs up!<br />kathy
1594204217|2.0|This is, at least in the beginning, a ponderous, boring, trivial account of food. It's not at all what I expected after reading other reviews. I felt as if Mr. Pollan thinks his readers are stupid. Since I didn't finish this blah, blah, blah bunch of words, I'm not giving a fair review, I know, but jeez, I just can't wade through the patronizing stuff.
B001R0O9K4|5.0|Love this movie. I don't care how phony Julia Roberts' Irish accent is, this will remain my all-time favourite movie.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|Look if your a Sonic fan or not, it doesn't matter if sonic doesn't run in this game. It has great graphics, especially fun to play, and one of my favorite games! (My opinion of course).I know not all out of us know sonic since he first came out. But some of us have. One thing for sure is we all love him, well except for Mario fans or what-not. This game has endless possibilities! Not the music the game Sonic Jump.
B00821OX98|4.0|I thought the adventure and drama was multifaceted and well balanced in this series.  Great mixture of drama, action, and sci-fi to create a well rounded show.
B004MC0FO8|3.0|Seems to take a while to load in the info.  I guess it could be my phone, but I don't think so.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|Dido is back to former style here, and I am thrilled!  This CD is reminiscent of No Angel, where she brings back her &#34;independent girl&#34; style with alot of romance thrown in.  I could listen to this over and over.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Additive. Love it!!!  Can't stop playing. So glad that my daughter recommended this game. Definitely one of my favorites!  Try it!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|To come back and know ow this place for the first time. A lesson in action for me. Thank you
B0063M22QO|5.0|Have enjoyed playing Mahjong. Very relaxing and entertaining.Great game for a rainy day or to just pass the time. My grandchildren will love playing this when they come over.
0062238868|5.0|No question about it, Kyle knew what his job was and how to do it in a very professional manner.  It is very well written and if you are interested in what the world of a sniper is all about...this book it it..
1426308469|5.0|Grandson actually opened the book during a Bparty and started reading instead on going to next gift to unwrap.  Miracle!
0736092269|5.0|another GREAT book by Delavier....super art work showing how each part of the anatomy responds to the workout plan...big help in understanding how to get the results
B007IK44CK|5.0|Really enjoyed the action and imagination.  The movie continues at a fast pace and hold your interest all the time
1475143389|5.0|another great book from Matthews....the instructions are are clear and easy to follow...and the author know what he is talking about...it is a easy read and simple to follow...check out his other books too...
B0086700CM|5.0|once you try it you are hooked.great game and is not bugging you to spend money to advance.would advise anyone to try it.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Don't know why this is a default book. Stupid to get your book. Tommorow I will not get it. Stupid
B009NY43NY|3.0|I've waited a long time for this. However many books there were in the series - and I stopped counting a long time ago - I waited through them (as they steadily got a little more lacklustre &#34;tome by tome&#34;). I've waited through the terrible television adaptation for some sort of closure to all the loose ends... and, well, I got this. I can't say I was entirely satisfied, but it was an ending nonetheless... now I can move on to (hopefully) greener pastures.
B00992CF6W|4.0|We love this app but where's the new update? Android and Apple have released theirs. How come Amazon hasn't? We can't play multiplayer with updated Minecraft edition. Hurry up, Amazon!
B009ZW70WK|1.0|I wanted to see the film because of the trailer and because it was in the inspirational films.  However the language used and the language content are not my style.  I didn't realize it was rated R.  so therefore it was my mistake.  The acting superb.  I like the actors and they drew me into the plot a bit, however It just was too dirty for me.  I don't like dirty films.  for me this was dirty.  I only saw  20 minutes and decided not to continue.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show! Love story, drama, intrigue, suspense, betrayal, all of it. I highly recommend this show. Don't miss it.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Even though the writer wrote well, the story was absolutely depressing.  I feel sorry that the author feels he needs to unveil such an odd tale to be read
B000N7KTBU|5.0|Great case I will be getting another soon. If you get you will be happy with it as I am.
B0053KWDES|5.0|This is a very nice addition to my iPhone/iPad listening stuff. I like that it has its own volume control, it comes nicely packed in a foam lined metal case.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great! Worth the buy! I love it! You will not regret watching this and you will be counting the days until the next season premiere.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I've been a big AIC fan for almost 20 years now, and am still amazed at the depth of some of the song writing.  There are some real gems here too.  However I felt as I kept listening to the album it was kind of dragging, and was a bit tiring listening to the entire thing.  With previous album I felt it was going somewhere and had a nice resolution, I did not get that feeling here.
0374214913|4.0|It's not what I expected, but as a former San Francisco resident, it was memorable just for the locales. Mr Sloan does a good job of exploring the &#34;Is print dead?&#34; quandary.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am shocked. I can't believe it was over so fast. Will read again. Loved it. Can't wait for book four.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Fun show, Vikings and space monsters with Caviezel as a convincing hero.  Sci-Fi without the cheese but plenty of action
B004PIA4BI|4.0|Nothing to get excited about, it's a battery for a phone. Cannot yet say if it'll live as long as the original, but it still gives me the same operating hours as when the phone was new after some 15 charging cycles, so I'm happy. Very descent price too.
0385344228|3.0|I intentionally did not read \\"About the Author\\" until I finished \\"Defending Jacob,\\" but about a page in, I was 99.9% positive I was dealing with another lawyer-turned-novelist. No offense to Mr. Landay, it takes one to know one, and at least he has finished and sold three books while I futz around writing reviews on Amazon trying to work through what might make a story I'd believe in enough to try to publish.  On to \\"Defending Jacob\\"--a book I was absolutely going to finish--fast--but in which I found too many flaws to rate more than three stars.<br /><br />Narrator Andy Barber, the top-ranking assistant prosecutor in the District Attorney's office in an affluent Boston suburb, wants more than anything to believe that he and his family are normal. In spite of his dark personal history, Andy has happily been with his college sweetheart wife Laurie for 34 years. The Barbers have one son, 14-year-old Jacob, a nice-looking, intelligent boy who, although he's not winning any middle school popularity contests, seems like a typical teenager to his parents. Then someone stabs Jacob's classmate, Ben Rifkin, to death on the way to school. Jacob quickly becomes the prime suspect and faces life without parole if convicted. Andy, who has spent his entire life building and maintaining walls of strength around the core of fear he carries from his past, and Laurie, a woman from a shadowy but apparently adversity-free background, suddenly must cope with as-abnormal-as-it-gets.<br /><br />What I liked best about \\"Defending Jacob\\" was its astute observation of the secular well-to-do professional classes: an arriviste like Andy tries to lock his unsavory history in a trunk and throw it in a dark basement corner; gatherings of parents that separate into circles of mothers chatting animatedly and dads looking awkward; teenagers' locked-down interactions with their parents and wildly indiscreet interactions with their peers, especially online; a fetishistic concern with parental decision-making and its outcomes; and an almost religious awe of the latest scientific findings. The \\"what would you do if\\" questions posed to parents by \\"Defending Jacob\\" are intriguing. Finally, \\"Defending Jacob\\" keeps the reader turning the pages in spite of its sometimes plodding pace and frequent repetitions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a lot of the prose bumbles and stumbles. To be fair, the writing improves somewhat as the book goes on, but at the beginning, I was mentally rewriting sentence after sentence and thinking, \\"Well, that would get an obscure technical point across to an overworked judge, but it could have been phrased a lot more artfully.\\" The courtroom scenes dragged. Landay, a former prosecutor, certainly achieves verisimilitude, but someone should tell him he's writing fiction so it's OK to condense and smooth out the testimony to make it more enjoyable to read.  I don't want to go into plot details for fear of spoilers, but two big twists were so far beyond the pale, particularly when contrasted with the author's efforts to otherwise accurately reflect a community and its mores, that they pretty much wrecked it for me.<br /><br />\\"Defending Jacob\\" is a competent book that had the potential to be a great deal better than it is.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Good as always and a fitting end to the series, in my opinion. Don't want to say too much without giving away the storyline, but Harris wrapped up the Sookie saga well.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie just as much as I did the other LotR movies.  I have always liked the race of the dwarves best, so that's part of the reason I liked this movie so much.  [spoiler] My only disappointment in the movie is the lack of any clear scenes with the dragon.  But I understand they're saving those for the next movie.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time I hope to hear more of the author and his series
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am giving this book two stars because it pretty much sucked! Man, that really sucks to even say! BARED TO YOU is one of my favorite books ever. And I've read some books! But this one, sucked!! And she NOT. EVEN. FINISHED!!!<br />A few reason why it sucked..<br />1- It just went on and on about stupid stuff, like what the girl in the coffee shop was wearing right down to every detail. I mean come on, GET ON WITH IT!!<br /><br />2- Although there are some major hot sex scene, there is just way to much! Come on, her kitten will be falling out by the time she is 40, she will be so stretched out! All though with their millions I'm sure they could take care of it!<br /><br />And 3- Not only do she repeat things from the first two books ( which isn't such a bad idea if you didn't reread them like I did), but she double repeated some part!! Just filling up space!<br /><br />And now there is a 4 th and maybe a 5 th book!!!!! Shame!!!<br />I am so done with this Series! They got my 30 bucks and that's all they are getting!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found this book to be extremely interesting and informative.  What an incredible man.  I had no idea of all the things he made possible by his many inventions.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book!  It brought all the emotions in me. I was sad and glad when it ended. I highly recommend it!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I've been working on a project for almost a year that is very similar to the main project in the book.  The similarities have been VERY scary.  Because of this book, my company is in the process of changing how we do things.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think that the game ice age village is an amazing game. Because I like to collect. And get stars
B005723JSQ|5.0|Entertaining read.  Good beach read.  Sophie Kinsella's books tend to follow a pattern of witty, but slightly dizzy, English girls who find themselves caught up in unusual conflicts that requires charm and imagination to resolve.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Not your typical series where violence and profanity reign.  Witty, funny, serious, and everything in between.  My wife and I love it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am totally hooked.  Can't wait to read the rest of the story.  I hope I don't have to wait too long!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Let me start by saying that I did not see the movie...the book had to stand on it's own for me...hoping for a true reading experience.  But as the narrative continued on, with very little variance in style I kept wondering if the visual aid would have helped. When the reading gets slow, there is no Bradly Cooper to look at.<br />So, for many reasons,  I found the book monotone.  While much of that may have been intentional due to the fact that it is a &#34;play by play&#34; of events as seen through the mind of a man fresh out of intensive therapy...the lack of variance was hard to tolerate.  The slow unveiling of facts leading up to the conclusion was a bit predictable for me. Interestingly, in a side note, the main character's analysis of classic books he is reading throughout the story are insightful and offer his unique point of view on some of the books we all had to read in high school.<br />It reads quickly.  Your reading enjoyment will be enhanced greatly if you are a Philadelphia Eagles fan...
B004WJRF6C|4.0|I was very PLEASANTLY SURPRISED at the sound quality of Macca's remaster here. Looks like the McCartney Archived Collection is getting a very good treatment at Abbey Road studios. If you liked this album, you'll be glad you bought it.
B00AG297GK|3.0|Funny movie but could have been better made, lol and not like the chips... I give this movie 3 stars
B005RYF5JA|5.0|A prime sampling of the pure talent of the Celtic Woman music and if you have not seen the live show it's a one in a life time MUST see.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Okay this movie gets 4 stars, but it could have had a wee bit more action. I seen the Asian version of this movie and it was awsome! But this movie is worth watching, but needs a wee bit more action.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|It's just a fun little game, kinda like doodle jump. It's just a fun time waster.<br /><br />I don't know why people are so pissed off. As technology advances, you'll literally never escape the invasive technology of companies.<br /><br />I enjoy this game.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Lots of fun for the kids. If they can't read you'll have too help them, but fun for mom and dad too!
1451695187|1.0|The author documents his experience here but fails to incorporate the biggest Near Life Experince in history as opposed to his Near Death Experience.  I'm referring to the incarnation of Jesus who visted our side of the veil for 33 years.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Great book and I'm at 215 from 250... whew! Really informative and changes the way you understanding of carbs and how your body burns fat.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Great music to buy. My daughter plays violin and she loves this cd. Product is as described and priced right. I recommend to anyone that likes violin music.
B00795P4EG|5.0|This app really does what it says it will do- remove unwanted objects from a photo!  I took a pic from my car and a bit of the window frame was in it; I used this to take it off and I must say it worked better than I thought it would.  Removing smaller objects works the best - all in all a fun app!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|At 71  I am a bit old for a &#34;new ager&#34;, even too old to be Baby Boomer but I have, over the years read everything Castaneda wrote and is writing is just as vivid for me as it was so many years ago. Granted, his works are not for everyone but for those than can &#34;hear&#34; he is one of the most powerful writers of our times-------perhaps in history.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|this didn't work. See my other reviews for a better alternative. Amazon sells a cable that works great, but this particular adapter is worthless.
0091949300|5.0|I love to read about history especially when I learn things I had not known.  This book delivers.  If you liked Howard Zinn's  &#34;People's History&#34; you will probably enjoy this.
B008Y768XO|2.0|They did it for the sake of a story I think. That's the nature of pet dogs everybody knew it. They could have done better to save the dog from misery, if they truly loved the dog.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the first 2. It continued the growth of the characters and given the timeframe it is set in and previous happenings, I felt that Ms Day packed a lot into this book.  I am looking forward to the next 2 books to wrap up the series and see what happens with the main characters and minor characters.  A good book to read and a great series.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Oh Sylvia..........what were you thinking with this book. How did it go from a trilogy to 5 books in the space of six months??. You have to wonder what went on behind the scenes with this series because we were all expecting the happy ever after that we deserved after the brutal second instalment in the series only to discover that it would be drawn out over another three.  the content was bland and cheesy at times and focusing so much on allot of other characters which felt unnecessary and a way of dragging out the series. It's so sad because the first two books were first class offerings and the third needed to complete the story but instead we are subjected to a dragging on of the story for the sake of extending the series. I read it was because the characters especially Gideon needed further development which does happen I will give it that but we spend so much time on the others ( and so many others) that it detracts from the focal relationship that we love Gideon and Eva. Don't get me wrong there is lots of Eva and Gideon and some toe curling sex scenes but I think we all invested allot of emotion in the series and that's why people are so scathing in their reviews because it fell short. No disrespect to Ms Day but we have to tell it how we see it. I will purchase the other books because I want my happy ever after even if I have to wait another six months. We've come this far we have to see it through!,
0525478817|5.0|This was by far the best book i have ever read. I fell in love with hazel and augustus! John green wrote about love in a way that shows how powerful something or someone can really be.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Based in a real story, it's a powerful movie to watch. You have to hold your breath and wipe tears but it's an amazing survival story and make you rethink your life and your concept of God. Enjoy!
B0078N2T8I|5.0|Probably one of the best movies made in the last decade.<br />Classic movie of an unaware seer and those that keep their<br />heads in the sand and don't listen.<br />Powerful ending, that leaves one stunned and thinking for<br />many nights after.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very nice movie. It's full of ideas and we had a good time watching it. It's original with beautiful images.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game that you can play and it can do a lot of thing its the best
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Interesting movie to watch. It's a combination of romance, comedy and drama but the best part is really the actors performance. Don't miss it. You can also find the book on stores.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It's a challenge and it is fun. My five year old even likes to play it.. now I just need someone to play against that can beat my score.. definitely worth playing
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|this game is really cool. you wanna now why? because its just like cut the rope but cooler. i with those blobs would come to life bacause i want to hold one.but any way my little sister has this app and i played it two or three times and its awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool game I had this game since May 1st and I just finished all of the Tokyo challenges so the game took me to Miami<br />and since I finished the Tokyo challenges the game said,good job now you will get to have a around the world tour!that's why I love this game!!!!!:) (:):p
B0038LB4TE|5.0|but not the best of his novels ,look forward to reading another one soon<br />might have a rest from Reacher
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My review on this is very good I love this book as always I love these books and I hope they come out with more so please make a new one quick : )  ° °<br />  U
B008CJ0KBU|3.0|I caught some episodes on the SyFy channel and was hooked!<br /><br />I had assumed that since the episodes on the SyFy channel were captioned for the hearing impaired, the original disks on DVD were as well. They are NOT! Is Funimation kidding?! Shame on them!<br /><br />I really wanted to buy this show and am so frustrated that they cut off a segment of the population who would also love it.<br /><br />So while I rate the show a solid 4 1/2 stars for content (it IS, after all, a hot 'n sexy show about a succubus who is trying to find out where she belongs in life, surrounded by equally hot and quirky characters), I give them 1 star for not accommodating the hearing impaired.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app but I still have not got the update. I received the update on my phone but not on here! Well other than that this is a great app. definitely worth the money.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This would be excellent to teach kids logic, and to help seniors keep sharp. Didn't like the graphics at first, but they grew on me.  Be careful of sliding your pudding guys off the platform. Also, why is this about pudding, when they CLEARLY look like Jello? Just wondering.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for any age group. Nice graphics and very entertaining! I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was a terrifying and emotional rollercoaster from begining to end. The effects and the way the producers pull you into this horrible event just leaves your wits at end while hoping for all to turn out okay. A must see for all family.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Lots of fun and good for wasting time. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a decent RPG. Hope you all like it too.
1449437524|5.0|Another wonderful collection from Mr Inman. I just wish it was bigger! It is much smaller than his last 2 books. But still all the same hilarious cartoons!
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Now I can manage my pages without going into my main Facebook page.  It is also easier to use. Love it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Wonderful actors.  Delightful story and music.  A movie that I love to watch--over and over again. I would love to see Matthew Macfaden and Kiera Knightly paired up in other movies.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I use the basic features but my kids love the scientific calculator.  Goes where I go which makes it a handy tool.
B00364K6YW|3.0|The lead actors, Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle were quite remarkable.  However, many of the other characters and setting were mediocre.  Didn't have the same passion as the Macfaden and Knightly duo.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This Mahjong never leaves you bored.  You keep wanting to play more and more.  recommend it to everyone who wants a challenge
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this show and can't wait for the new season to start.  I was going out of town when I downloaded this season to get caught up.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|Patrick Rothfuss has a great deal of skill as a wordsmith but little as a storyteller.  This trilogy so far desperately needs a hardcore editor who is unafraid to make cuts, trim the fat and keep the author on track.  Entire sections of the book contribute nothing to the overall story and can be skipped with little or no impact (i.e. The several chapters on the Adem) however events often alluded to frustratingly never seem to materialize.<br /><br />The characters are either shallow one dimensional window dressing or in the case of Kvothe, the protagonist, so completely unbelievable it is hard to identify with them. (For example he becomes a master swordsman, world class lover, diplomat and military officer over his school break... Of course he is already a brilliant Mage and musician.)<br /><br />As others have expressed, it is difficult to see how Rothfuss will tie up all the loose ends in the third book.  He has potential as an author but this trilogy has little hope short of a rewrite/reedit. (Something that should not be frowned on, after all Tolkien did it a few times with LoTR)<br /><br />The reason for three stars instead of one is despite these flaws I really wanted to like this tale.  I will buy the third book, more out of curiosity at this point.  So far with the trilogy, strong start, weak middle.  Let's hope for a strong finish.
1878424505|5.0|I so enjoyed reading The Four Agreements and learned so much from it that I believe it's a &#34;must read&#34; so I purchased for graduating high school senior.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I love all of the Die Hard Movies and this one was awsome the stunts the story and the specail effects were awsome!
0345803493|3.0|So after reading the first book, just had to continue on with the second book. Again, entertaining storyline. Unbelievable characters.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This story forces the audience to be on their toes to connect all of the dots during the unfolding of the piece. The reason the story works is solely because of the capabilities of the fine actors and actresses in the movie.
0345803507|3.0|After reading the first and second book, I actually became bored and had difficulty reading through to the end of the book.
B007C94XG4|3.0|What can you say? If you have seen one Chipmunk video you have seen them all. However, the grandkids love them so we enjoy them together.
0345803485|4.0|I learned about this book from my bestfriend's mother (70+) so I decided to purchase. Tantalizing, sizzling and taboo which is why I believe it had so much interest and appeal. Good entertainment.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Overall story carries one away into love of family and the resilience of the human spirit. Well done and keeps one mindful of how even the most idyllic surroundings can turn into disaster that must be overcome. Watts is amazing and her ensemble cast were also up to the task.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Reading the synopsis I first thought I wouldn't like to read this; however, luckily I did. The storytelling, the science and everything else is just brilliant, definitely worth your time!
B00005LIN0|3.0|I simply cannot believe Sir Simon Rattle would allow for this superb music to be lip-synched by the singers themselves in a performance that bears his name.  The mix of film and stage does justice to neither.  The 1958 film which everone seems to be after was quite faithful in terms of staging,  but none of the singers was really an opera professional, and Poitier did not even sing. Porgy on crutches?  Gimme a break.  Unfortunately, the Houston Grand Opera version, which I saw both on Broadway and City Opera, and another staging, which I saw at the Met, were never filmed, so this is all we get, and something is better than nothing.  That off my chest, the music still captivates, the singers (if you do not look at their mouths) are superb, and Rattle still one of the best directors around. And the mix makes the production hyper realistic (to British eyes, I assume), which is a big plus.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book was HOT HOT HOT however it was very drawn out and anticlimactic (no pun intended) it was a good read but nothing that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Looking forward to the next one.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It is a SIMPLE calculator that as many other thing should have been incorporated from the beginning on the Kindle
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I simply love the characters, Gideon and Eva have such chemistry it's amazing how well she's captured their love and passion!  But I was not pleased with the ending, she must get better with wrapping up her books. I understand wanting to hold readers interest but leaving the readers angry isn't the answer.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I absolutely love this kind of hidden object games. They've got a little bit of everything in them. Challenging but not so much to be frustrating.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I loved the character of Jack Reacher.  He is a good person but does not take any crap.  he is loyal to friends, family and especially country.  I cannot wait to read the next jack reacher book.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|GREAT book. The books either get more intense as they go on or are just as intense as the book before. Many secrets are answered and it ends in suspense.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Hate that keeps me hanging but I do love this book!! Can't wait for th  next one maybe it want take long for it to come out!!!
1439130833|5.0|What joy in having a tool to help me remember to be grateful for the blessings in my life. I feel change each day and I know this is a lifelong process of thankfulness for me. Thank-you Rhonda!
B005NQ5LSC|4.0|Fast shipment and item as described. Movie is fun but wish it was a little more accurate. It was nice to see ip chun in the movie.
0375869026|5.0|Bullying is  and has been a big problem among children. This book give a good perspective from a recipient and supportive family.
032147404X|5.0|This has to be the best digital photography book I've read in awhile  It has everything I was expecting in a photography book!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I can't believe I waited this long for this waste of a book! I cannot believe that a book is allowed to be published when it doesn't even have a plot, just a bunch of desperate nonsense continuously thrown in to stretch the book on! Nothing ever really happens, your just reading a bunch of nothing. There's not even an ending, it just abruptly stops damn near mid sentence. This series has now became just a means of making money rather than entertaining readers. Ms. Day is obviously milking this for all she can and I will not feed into her tactics. I can sum up this book in less than a paragraph for you to save your self the agony of reading this book and from wasting your money. Here it goes:<br /><br />\\"I love you.\\" \\"I love you more.\\" \\"But I love you\\" \\"Man I really love you.\\" Lets have sex ten times in a row. Did I mention that \\" I love you?\\" \\"I need you.\\" \\"I need you so much.\\" \\"oh yeah and I love you.\\" \\"Really? I love you too!\\" Time for sex again because.... \\"I really love you.\\" THE END.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|great movie and great cast. tom hanks and sandra bullock were excellent and the young man who played their son was outstanding.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig as James Bond is growing on me.  I was a Pierce Brosnan fan who found Daniel a bit too tough in the role (maybe more realistic as an agent, but I really liked Pierce's suave charm).  This is certainly the best of Daniel's movies as James Bond, and perhaps one of the best James Bond movies ever.  Perhaps the &#34;psychological&#34; component to Javier Bardem's villain was appealing to me.  He wasn't just evil - there was a reason for his madness that made it relatable in a way most villains aren't.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|man, i loved this movie. everybody did an excellent job.neil patrick harris consummate actor. i watched the cartoon as a kid.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|WTH!!!!! If your looking for an ending......whether it be happy or cliffhanger,.....well you won't get it here!!! The book just ends, in my opinion it ends too fast and to random. I also felt the book left a lot of unanswered questions!! I've never gave a book anything less than 5 stars and I really can't believe I'm not doing it here, but I was truly disappointed!!!!!
B0089LOG02|2.0|The fact that there actually were Orphan Trains was fascinating.  However, I read the book in one day because the writing was quite simple and would be perfect for young readers.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I'm happy with it! I'm hard of hearing, and I had no problem waking up to the alarm clock app this morning! It was perfect!
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|My kids (3,5,8) liked it and watched it twice in the first day i rented it. They were familiar with the characters after playing the lego batman game. We had a good time watching it. Lego animation is fun.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Yet another amazing book. Can't wait for the next. Impatiently awaiting the conclusion to this epic Tolkeinesque writer's beautifully crafted world.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|My favorite series of the several fantasy series I've read. Few are in its league, but I would say the series, &#34;The Song of Fire and Ice&#34;, &#34;The First Law&#34; and &#34;Sword of Truth&#34; all dance around 1st to 4th place. Though the longer series have some weaker books, all the first and second books in these series are excellent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved it I get to play w/my friends on it is an amazing game and I am glad to have  bought it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Viewing this great collection is like visiting with a large group of old friends.  So many of the great TV and movie stars appeared in the remarkably long run of this series.  Many of them have passed away, so the set is an opportunity to see them in their prime.  The collection combines what they defined as the &#34;series&#34; and what they identify as the &#34;made for TV movies&#34;.  No matter what they call them, it's a lot of fun.  The standard plot gag where the guilty party attempts to help Colombo solve the case is somewhat bothersome, but the trail of clues is still there for getting.  It's as comfortable to wrap yourself up in as that ancient raincoat that Peter Falk brought in from his home closet.<br />Oh, 'scuse me.  I'm sorry.  Just one more thing.....Amazon has a great price on this item!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The writing and acting in Hannibal are simply amazing. Probably not a show for the faint of heart, but it's so well done that I highly recommend giving it a shot. So glad it got picked up for a second season! You'll be hooked and kept on the edge of your seat!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Really great game, find it hard to put down sometimes. If you have an hour to kill this is the game!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so funny, probably the best in the series.  The pictures were good too.  Both me and my sister read it in one day and we don't like to read too much.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The ui is so nice in this game, but it is hardly surprising, since cut the rope was so good. Fun game. Also, a bold move to change from a timed game to a more strategy based game.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|I've always loved Rod's voice and appreciate that he has stayed true to his generation by aging gracefully with his music choices.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I very much enjoyed &#34;Mockingjay&#34;.  As is true of most readers, I would imagine, once I began reading the trilogy I couldn't stop until I'd finished the last book.  I think Suzanne Collins it a very good author whose descriptive passages put me in the arena with the other combatants.  I am preparing to read some of her other works.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good kids game my children love it so much its great one to download perfect for learning handand eye cordnation
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Was forced to give it at least one star. Waited for so long for this book to be released only for it to be delayed, then after reading the reviews, I returned the pre-ordered book. I'm really disappointed it is now going to be a five book series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By: E.L. James<br />Published By: Vintage Books<br />Age Recommended: Adult<br />Reviewed By: Arlena Dean<br />Rating: 5<br />Series: Fifty Shades #2<br />Review:<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" by E.L. James was the second in the series and as the first novel this one too held my undivided attention till the end. There will be so many twist and turns that goes on between these two people...Anna (Anastasia and Christian. This author really has the writing ability to keep us on the edge of our seat with all that is going on. Its really a 'heart pounding novel.' As you read you will find out this whole story is not only about the sex. It is not only a wonderful and but yet sad story. I can't hardly wait till the next novel because I know it will tie this story all together. So, with that being said I am starting on the last one now!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this series for how it captures the reader and teaches them at the same time. It's not an easy end, but it feels real.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|By: E.L.

L. James was the conclusion to this 'Fifty Shades Series' and what a read it was. I was somewhat sad to see it end. Truly this author has given us all something to think about as she had truly shared her writing ability as well as her 'imagination with the world.' All three of these books were some read like I have never read before and in the end it all makes sense of why Christian was the way he was. And let me not leave his Anastasia. Wow! she was really something else. I am so glad all ended well for them. Do I have a favorite novel ... no, I like them all ...what's not to be 'Grey, Dark but in the end finally FREED! Great job to this author!
B000FC1192|5.0|First scary story i enjoyed and read again. It scared the crap out of me as a kid, but i couldn't put it down. I loved the movie about it too, and own both :)
0307155102|5.0|For such an inexpensive book it is full of so much good stuff. The seller got it to me quite quickly, it is used and had some highlighter marks inside, but thats ok for how little I paid. I am an SLP who works in a preschool so I prefer used books. This book is so versatile to work with these kiddos, so many pictures, categories and things to talk about!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|GRRM is an amazing writer, even as he breaks your heart. As anyone who reads his books or watches the show learns, NEVER GET ATTACHED TO ANYONE. Mr. Martin aims to write realistically (and he succeeds), so expect reality, which means hard truths and rarely a 'happy ending' of any sort.
B002I8PVQA|3.0|This film is entertaining but requires a little patience in the beginning as it does move a little slow.  A great ending though!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Mr. Sanderson always creates amazing magic systems and i love everyone of them. This latest one is even more fascinating than i had expected, and i hope to see more. If you're curious, read it, any sci-fi/fantasy will love it.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|A classic analysis of man's decent into sin and death. Wonderfully written with many witty statements. An expose of the moral degeneracy of the age.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Fantastic graphics! Amazing puzzles! This is the best game of this series of Cut the Rope games, you don't wanna miss this one if you like the serie...
B0087HT36U|4.0|it is a fun game, and just needs a few more levels. also it wouldnt hurt to add the option to select which round of ammo you shoot firsr.
0679805273|5.0|Used the two books at senior assembly o recognize two Gates Scholars from our high school! The price was also awesome!
B0042HOU26|5.0|My son loved this set.  He's 10.  He likes the ones who come with lots of &#34;guys&#34;  It's pretty much what was expected.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I think all the 1 star reviews are unfair.  People thought the series was going to be a trilogy and are learning this is now a set of 5 books instead.  They're angry to learn the plot line remains unresolved, and are basing their reviews on that.  Granted this book wasn't as good as the first two, but I still enjoyed it, and am very likely to buy the next book when it's published.
0761169431|1.0|This book promotes murder/homicide tendencies.  I wanted to kill my husband for letting my son talk him into buying it, and I wanted to kill myself so I would no longer hear the pleas to make these and the cries when they didn't come out.  The diagrams absolutely suck and the instructions might as well be in Japanese, but then again who knows, maybe that would help somehow?  Unless you are some kind of origami prodigy junkie...run SCREAMING from this purchase.  Thank you Chris Alexander for the increased anxiety and panic attacks...and xanax thanks you too!
0345803507|5.0|the price was great ...i got all 3 so much cheaper than barnes and noble or even coscoe... my sister still has the third one ... i'm waiting for her to return it so i have the trilogy.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|A good movie that proves time and time again that when you forget just who may be living in a small town could be bad for your health if you have bad intentions.  Just because it is a small town does not mean the people are small.  Kind of reminds me of Walking Tall with Buford Pusser.
0345803493|5.0|my family loves this book....my sis still has the third one and won't return it back to me so i can have the complete set.
B004LSJC8I|5.0|This quirky little indie electro pop album is a gem. My favorite track is probably \\"The Look\\", which is absolutely sublime. It keeps adding layers of sounds and vocal harmonies to a catchy organ riff. By the time the tune crescendos in a synthesizer solo, if you are like me you will find yourself delirious with happiness. \\"She wants\\" sets up a slightly sinister vibe, but is still very catchy and fun. The other songs are excellent as well. The fact that the sound is a little lo-fi, and a lot of the live instrumentation is less than virtuoso level only adds to the charms. A great album that any fan of Twin Shadow, Yeasayer, Electric Guest, etc. might enjoy.
0345803485|5.0|if you are bored this is an interesting read ... all the women in my family won't put it down
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|A fun app to pass time. Surprisingly challenging. Nice graphics. Engaging but not not over the top.  I really enjoy playing it.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Good show starts a bit slow. I would have liked more of the invasion story myself. Once you watch enough you get the picture.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|I was first introduced to Tyler, the Creator on The Game's \\"Martian vs Goblins\\" track where he made a very funny reference to Lebron's hairline. Since then I kept my ear to the street looking for anything new with his name attached to it. When I finally listened to \\"Goblin\\" I was a little disappointed. He still had plenty of one liners and his rap skills were impressive at times but it was missing something. Maybe it was continuity or just an overall flow to the album. Hoping for more, I decided to give him one last try before I dropped him off my radar like I did Saigon and Papoose. \\"Wolf\\" is Tyler, the Creator magnum opus.<br /><br />One thing you can say about Tyler, the Creator is that he holds nothing back. He says whatever is on his mind even if he is going hard on his fellow Odd Future teammates. Specifically, Frank Ocean, who has 3 songs on \\"Wolf\\" falls victim atleast 2 times to Tyler's unpredictable ad libs. I haven't heard someone use so many homophobic terms since Eminem was on drugs.  The album starts off with the dreamy, interlude \\"Wolf\\", which begins with a smooth piano until Tyler comes in with furious f-bombs. It is a perfect set up for things to come. Tyler does not rely purely on `shock rap'; he pours out every inch of his personality over and over again throughout the album.  If you need proof of Tyler's lyrical ability look no further than songs like \\"Colossus\\" and \\"Answer\\". On the melodic \\"Colossus\\", Tyler tells the story of an awkward moment he had with a homosexual fan at Six Flags. This is his \\"Stan\\" moment without the tragic ending. \\"Answer\\" features Tyler at his best, pouring out his thoughts about his absentee father, his Odd Future family, and a lost love.  Both songs are standout gems along with the Pharrell-assisted love song \\"IFHY\\".  On first listen I completely messed the message on \\"Pigs\\". But after reading the lyrics I realize he is telling a story that is very much connected to current events. Powerful song. The second half of the CD plays like an Odd Future collabo album with the best being \\"Rusty\\" featuring the highly underrated Earl Sweatshirt. \\"Trashwang\\" is solid but the supporting cast could have went harder. What makes this album special is Tyler's ability to carry a so-so track. \\"Slater\\" & \\"48\\" are not good songs but Tyler makes them listenable. but the album closes on a very high note with the very personal \\"Lone\\". Which sounds exactly like a 9th Wonder production.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me off when I first listened to this album was how it seemed like Tyler's flow did not sync with the beats. At times he was going faster than the beat and it made the songs flow weird.  After listening a few times this flaw is less noticeable. I give much credit to the production. I was impressed when I found out that Tyler did most of his own production. I like the tone, melody, and how he uses instruments especially the piano. I don't think these were live instruments but it works for me. The track arrangement is very good. Each song blends perfectly into each other. It reminds me of the track arrangement Frank Ocean used for \\"Channel Orange\\".<br /><br />Everyone who has read my reviews should know that originality means a lot to me. There aren't too many rappers as original as Tyler, the Creator.  I contemplated for a long time before I decided to rate this album. This album did not hit me right away like \\"Channel ORANGE\\" did but after a few spins and reading the lyrics, I realize this album is number one on my list. I am very happy I gave Tyler, the Creator a second chance because I would have missed out on the best album of 2013 so far. He has a chance at a long future. He has not made it as big as Kendrick Lamar, but the ceiling is high for him. Looks like I picked the right time to become a Tyler, the Creator fan.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is great. Fun pass time! I spend a lot of time at work playing games on my tablet an this is one of the more fun games play.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Great music; great cinematography; good performances, but I don't care for the story.  The criminal is the good guy and the policeman is the bad guy.  I get what they're trying to sell, I really do... the criminal acts were committed in times of need... and/or they're victims of the class-divided society... but I just can't buy into that.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I would have to agree with those who questioned the casting of this wonderful book.  The characters of Anne and Captain Wentworth as they were portrayed in this version simply don't work.  There is little emotion and they appear too old.  Jane Austen's wonderful writing deserved better.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|My daughter and I really like listening to Bruno Mars.  I could have done without Gorilla, but really like all the other songs.
B007NQVRNS|5.0|Clever, well acted, well written, etc.  Mystery, sci-fi, family love, etc.  For some reason it never comes up available for rent from the various movie sites...including Amazon....so I had to buy it as I have a friend who would love it.  I think.
073935275X|5.0|Bought these audio books for my mom after listening to the series myself.  Loved listening to the reader.  He made it all the more captivating.
B006LSZECO|2.0|A little too far fetched for this reader.  It started out interesting but fell apart for me.  I liked the plot of the story but the writer got too complicated with it which made it unreal.  I didn't like the end either.  Sorry Gillian.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Loved by all old guys who grew up with these dudes oh so many years ago.  Hi camp, hi humor quotient.  Just a bit too much character development.  Unbelievable action scenes.  Kick your disbelief into high gear.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|At a certain point in the beginning, I almost put it aside.  It is quite well written and I enjoyed it thru the end.  I skipped over most of the child abuse stuff as I am not one to like reading same.  Outside of that, a good book.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|A nice and clean widget make this app a good deal even not for free. This app accurately tells the user how much time he has left on his device in the current state.
B0000844I8|5.0|God how they associate perfectly ancient history to the stage... everything fits so well that makes we think this is real..I love watching it, the humor of colonel O'neil is a must...
B005QUQP76|5.0|Great product but I never got the sniper button to work as a custom button in any games I tried it in. Mainly BF3.
B000FBJFSC|1.0|Amazon was supposed to contact publisher Simon & Schuster about this; the type size of the electronic version varied from page to page and entire sections were missing.  Totally unable to read it!  Very frustrating.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This a wonderful heart warming story. I love &#34;feel good&#34; books and this one works. The author of this book must have a special spirit....because its such a sweet , sometimes a little sad but altogether heart warming book.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I appreciate the ability to change the number of pieces the puzzle can be has.  I can put them together, or my 3-year old Granddaughter can work the same puzzle, with different numbers of pieces.  Also, love that we can use our own pictures!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I didn't pay attention to the detail of this sweeper....I know there is a newer version out there that lets you just press the buttons on the top and the lid opens up over the trash can to let it fall in without having to touch the dirty catch all!  The newer version lets you swivel more easily in tight places!  But I had a swivel sweeper previous to this one and just love it because you don't have to get the vacuum out!
B006XIR9KM|5.0|This is really addictive to play.  I think of it as a memory builder for big boys.  I really enjoy it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really love this book, this trilogy, and I feel sad that there is not a fourth book yet. I hope doesnt take to long to come out.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Love having MY song be my wake up call!  I can have multiple alarms set.  Schedules can be different weekends from week days.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Eyes glued to the page. Mind racing with anticipation. My heart trapped. This is two characters you can't not invest your whole heart!
B00AW0KHMY|4.0|I was complete bored until the birth scene. Wow....what a mess!!! I enjoyed every minute of it. Looking forward to seeing the second installment.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was very disappointed after reading the 3rd book in the series.  It was so light in plot and spent so much time on characters that didn't matter.  I too feel like two more books were added for money, not for the conclusion of the series.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|Funny, entertaining, the perfect story to get lost in!  Ideal for reading on the plane or by the pool.  I have read several of Sophie Kinsella books and have enjoyed each one.
B00005O3VD|5.0|Babs at her best as always. I was only replacing my VHS, when I bought this DVD... a classic forever
B001FB55YE|4.0|It showed up when it said it would and was a great price for what some blu-rays can cost.  The product was in good quality and the movie is genuinely hilarious.  If you enjoyed Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, then give this one a try.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This game is fun...but after purchasing the expansion, the game didn't recognize that I had bought it.  Please fix these bugs...
034580404X|5.0|5 star for price, delivery, and reading! Couldnt ask for better service. Recommend ordering because everything was great. Only wish i could have gotten another set for a friend
B00D2K40WY|3.0|I believe this is a very entertaining game. Very simple though. There is no goal, so it's perfect for younger children. It only keeps me entertained for 2-5 mins... But it is still a cute game. ^^
0060555661|4.0|This is a must for anyone.  Doesn't matter if you aren't even into stocks, everyone needs to know how the markets work in the long term or you are gonna be out on your own when you retire with nothing to show for it.  Not for the short term day trader.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is very inaccurate and I love it that there's a feature telling the temp. My father uses this for his android phone and both think it's helpful.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Good acting and storyline. We all know the depths someone could reach through addiction. Some can find a way out of it, some can't.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|I was looking for some games that would be easy to learn and wouldn't take forever to play. I saw this game on Wil Wheaton's YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMtlQxJeWvc) and it had everything I was looking for.<br /><br />I've tried this game with &#34;hardcore&#34; gamers (the type that like in-depth games like Warhammer) and they enjoyed the game. I then tried it with some friends and family and had the same experience.<br /><br />The only thing I've noticed is that very often a person will end up with a huge winning streak. If you watch the Wil Wheaton video you'll see exactly what I'm describing. I thought the video was an aberration, but it seems that something similar has happened every single time I've played it. Someone will end up with 8 brains in one turn and the rest will have 3. I realize that's the nature of dice, but it does detract from the overall fun.<br /><br />It's a minor quibble. Zombie Dice is a fun game that you can take anywhere and I've yet to hear someone say it wasn't enjoyable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am a little behind the times. I didn't jump on the hunger game's bandwagon when it began. Didn't think I would really like it but after having 200+ channels and NOTHING on I decided why not I've had a curiosity about why everyone talked about this so much so after watching Hunger Games I decided lets see what the second book is about...after reading just a few pages I had to keep going to see what happened to Katniss and Peeta,and the rest of district12. To my amazement I couldn't put it down seriously I  read thru the night, there was never a \\"spot to put it down\\"and it took me less than a day to read the entire book. Which in retrospect probably wasn't a good idea cause now I have to wait for a whole month to read it thru amazon or buy it which I can't really do.wishing amazon would let you \\"borrow\\"more than one a month... but back to the book....Well done Suzanne Collins you've just gotten yourself another fan.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I have seen this group in concert three times already.  Their sound is awesome when you hear them live in concert.  The CD is really great but please do yourself a favor and watch their recent Saturday Night Live performance of Little Talks and Mountain Sound.<br /><br />http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/of-monsters-and-men-little-talks/n36350/<br /><br />http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/of-monsters-and-men-mountain-sound/n36358/<br /><br />I did buy this CD because of Little Talks.  Yeah ... ok ... I am not going to be one of those people who refuse to say they bought a CD based on the most popular song.  I did do some research on the lyrics and although the song is upbeat it's kind of a very sad song.  Here is the lead singer's interpretation of this song.<br /><br />It's about a couple and the husband passed away and it's from the conversation between the two of them. We don't know if she's going crazy or if someone's actually there. We've kind of been inspired by people that lived in my house. This old couple lived there for 30 years. The woman passed away, so it was kind of different.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Great album. If you love melodic metal music, this is a must have! Great from beginning to end; no bad song throughout it!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|My reading group had a very interesting discussion about Dr Alexanders experience. We were disturbed by his reference to the Worm hole. I have mixed emotions about referring it to friends.

B00BR0SGN0|3.0|Old rock gods still live. Well it's been 8 years since Purple have given us a new studio album. Has been worth the wait? Ummm yeah I'd say so.<br /><br />Not going to lie its tough to hear a purple studio album without Lord. To me the 3 key points of what makes Deep Purple sound like Deep Purple is the guitar, the voice, and the key boards. No disrespect to Glover and Paice. I've always found something to enjoy on every Purple album and line up.<br /><br />\\"Now What\\"offers some more things to like in the world of rock. I will always miss Blackmore. Purple's never been quite the same without him but I'm long passed it. Morse has been the axe wielder for at least the last 13 plus years and I'm fine with it.<br />He is an accomplished guitar player and he does his job well.<br /><br />This album still sounds like a Deep Purple Record. There are some points on the album that have the listener thinking \\"oh there's a bit of Fireball or Machinehead there\\". There is a strong blues feel to the album which the blues have always had its place in the purple sound.  So there is no problem there.  Gillian still sounds good especially for someone his age.<br /><br />The real thing is Airy. I'm familiar with his work with Purple. I own the DVD set where he and Lord trade off in John Lords farewell show. He does the job well enough. I'm a bit biased. John Lord is my favorite keyboardist, so anyone filling in for him won't completely do it for me.  But with all that aside he adds his own style to Purple.  He doesn't quite have the same riffs if you can call them that on the keys, more of a symphonic quality but its relatively good.<br /><br />At this stage in Deep Purple's career they have nothing to prove.  I'm sure critics have long passed on offending them. They do what they want to. They keep making blues influenced rock and keep the what's left of the golden age of hard rock alive, and I thank them for it.<br /><br />\\"Now What\\" in my honest opinion isn't Purple's milestone work but its still good and if you have been still listening to Deep Purple's work after all these years then please continue and buy this album. You won't be disappointed.but its still good and if you have been still listening to Deep Purple's work after all these years then please continue and buy this album. You won't be disappointed.
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Dysfunctional families create a spider web almost impossible to escape.  Their destructive and psychotic nature influences far greater than seemingly normal families. Gillian Flynn is one sick lady; thanks.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Finally!!!  I have found a calendar that works for me.  I like looking at the whole month and being able to see what is scheduled for each day.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I found book four to be a slow read with too many new characters introduced. Book five is getting back to the original characters and moving along at a much better pace,

B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game! Definetly buy it it's worth it! But on Kindle Fire it does take longer to update.
0061122416|5.0|I've shared this book with everyone in my family. It definitely transports you to a higher level of thinking. The only thing I didn't like, was the fact that it ended...
B00COGY2P2|2.0|Not only was the script and the movies storyline an issue; but really ... Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher, even the camera angles couldn't make him 6'4&#34;and built like a tank.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have  this game on the PC. But on th  kindle? YOU CAN NOW PLAY IT ANWHERE. Best game ever transferred to kindle. amazing, even though PC has more features, they are updating it some.more.to.be like PC
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Cannot put the book down<br />Although unrealistic you cannot wait for more<br />Loved all three books so far and cannot wait for the next
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this app is sooooo worth it. it tells you what percentage of ur battery is left and how much time you have before it dies. get this app while its free. :) :) :)
B004ZN9NCY|5.0|For those who love the Gateful Dead (and I'm one of them), Pink Floyd was probably one of the best space jam groups out there and this album is living proof.  Half of this double album is a live recording of four of their songs and clearly shows that they were capable of taking their music into some very cool places.  Here you can hear what they were capable of, without overdubs and frills.  A definite must for Pink Floyd fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game will you guys update the game so we can eat cake and party I already have plans for 0.7.0 update
B005MMJ84K|5.0|If you like the hunger games trilogy you will love delirium pandemonium's and Requiem. It gave you an insight into why love is so important in our lives and why they would be empty without it. I truly enjoyed each book and also the novelettes in between
159463176X|5.0|I am so pleased that Khaled Hosseini has given us another wonderful book.  I love the way he writes to bring his characters and settings so vividly to life.  May he write another winner soon, as the wait for this one was almost painful~
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have the World at War series on VHS and have had it since its release in the early 1970's. The engineers have done a marvellous job on remastering the series for DVD and with the added footage makes watching this historic series a whole new experience. Recommend purchase for all those interested in the history of WW2 or those like myself have the original series on tape.
B004H4XL7E|4.0|...will be more interesting to see how it works in practice and the amount of time needed to feel comfortable with the techniques.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|I loved this movie with Audrey Hepburn.  She is an excellent actor and so believable in this film.  It has been a long time since I have watched this movie, so I am looking forward to watching it again.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|It wasn't the best movie I have seen but it was a pretty good chick flick and I enjoyed it.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I like that you can flip gravity, and the multiplayer is fun. Plus it's not expencive. You should get this game, it's awesome!

B0092MKFIY|5.0|This entire CD is solid and I believe this is the best band to come along in years! Now with Itunes and such it motivates bands to put out strong singles while the rest of the album is rushed. Imagine Dragons instead produced a CD that I dont need to skip any tracks and each one is unique. I am a big fan of acts like Jimmy Eat World, Anberlin, Acceptance, The Fray, Relient K, Linkin Park, etc., but they havent released anything in awhile that I've been crazy about. But Imagine Dragons did, and I just hope they continue to release this caliber of a CD.<br /><br />Best song on the Album: Radioactive - I'm sure you've heard it on the radio now but this is their best song<br />My favorite song on the Album: Tip Toe - My favorite song since it hasnt been released on the radio yet, so it has not been overplayed. Just a unique awesome song.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing this game very addictive and lots of fun wish I could get more coins for a bingo. Lots of people to play against daily rewards are great too
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This is as funny, violent, and enjoyable as any Quentin Tarantino movie I have seen, maybe better than the Kill Bill duo. Lots of tongue-in-cheek humor and homage, great cameos by people like Michael Parks, and first-rate performances by Foxx and especially Christopher Waltz, who deserved his Oscar for it. Tarantino shows up and his cameo is blown, well, all out of proportion compared to other movies (yes, a small joke). Over-the-top violence as usual, but almost comic in most cases. Great soundtrack, a mix of old and new.  Enjoy it for the Tarantino cult classic it will become!
B009NY43NY|4.0|After the last book I was not amazed and it took me months to get into it but this one much better and I didn't want to put it down. It was easier to follow and I love the ending and that Sookie is with someone that you wouldn't expect.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I want to know when the next  one will be out. It's very fun and entertaining and I really enjoy the characters
B0095P33IW|5.0|This is a really good movie if your into the Marvel super Hero Movies . I think they did a really good casting job on picking Chris Evan to play the role of Capt. America .
B003JBI2KM|5.0|I received a brew brew kit from my kiddos for Christmas.  I peaked my interest, but I quickly learned that there is so much to learn.  This book rocks.  Teaches you from the beginning to the end of how to brew great beer.  There are hundreds of great reviews for this book.  Stop reading the reviews and just get the book.
B00AG297GK|1.0|The Movie had a few giggles but it was mostly stupid and gross.  I could not even finish the movie and turned it off becasue it was a waste of time.
B009MYAQK4|3.0|I expected more from Coelho.  Further, if you going to quote the Bible, you should really give credit and citations.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game its so much fun but it rodent seem to ever be dark and theirs no enimies???
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I am recommending this to all the young women and teenage girls that I know.  It should be required reading for &#34;womanhood&#34;.  Let's not repeat the same mistakes made by my generation.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The music is beautiful, the plot romantic that touches the heart.  Well thought out -  the music works with the story line so well.<br />Favorite songs: Think of me, Point of No Return.  Going between scenes from 1870 and 1919 very effective in the movie.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Great casting and a good story of how today's women are only truly happy when they think for themselves. Enjoy!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait for book 4. I'm not ready for the series to end once again Sylvia doesn't disappoint. Best book of the series

B007SOQBCM|5.0|I had been a l ways been trying to watch mindcrack live streams until they came out with the twitch app I am so overjoyed I can now watch any of my favorite live gamers at any time.
1400079144|3.0|Started a little slow but gained momentum to a premature climax followed by a final 50 pages of confusing filling in of unrelated finishing details.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|sucked me in right away.  very enjoyable.  my 4 year old likes the graphics while I enjoyed the gameplay.  good timekiller also.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Can't say much beyond all the good praise other than this is the most emotional, thought provoking album I've listened to in a very long time.  The title track alone will make you stop and ponder your life if you let it.  Truly a great album worth listening to'
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This was recommended and I do love it, but &#34;Hate&#34; the third season ending, might not buy next season. Even my husband is not sure he'll watch.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I have recommended Orphan Black to my family members and friends as it keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. So so disappointed that we all have to wait a year to see what happens next.  By far the best show I have ever seen. Just amazing we all agree!!!  There is nothing like it, once you watch it your hooked.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I was somewhat unsure whether or not this app would really deliver on quality and overall satisfaction, mostly because of the fact that it was a free install. I am, however, greatly pleased to say that I'm extremely delighted with it and it has thoroughly surpassed all my expectations of what I was anticipating. Although I have yet to delve into the multiplayer function of the game I can say that the single player is very fun and engaging, and a great way to pass the time.<br /><br />  In my opinion this app could easily be marketed at upwards of 4 to 5 Dollars simply for the single player alone. I will caution Kindle Fire HD users to be a little careful as the touchscreen can be a bit too touchy on the shop menu in the game. Aside from that, an excellent game thus far. Kudos to Gameloft.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of the most catchy books I've read in a long  time. Once you start reading you can't stop until is finished. Great story I try reading the second but not as good.
B00992CF6W|1.0|we need caves and dungeons and strongholds and unlimited world generation so we can have freedom and so we can switch from creative to survival in the game
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun & fast game. I think it is challenging to try & see the whole board while you are knocking out Diamonds before you get time out. Really fun & addictive.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a &#34;I can't put it down book&#34;.  The book had me captivated from beginning to end!! I love Nicholas Sparks work!
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. I'm a surfer and I love movies that showcase the sport. A must watch for all surf lovers.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I can't rate the series, its not my thing, they are for a gift for my wife. I guess the equalizer is that she just doesn't understand &#34;The Deadliest Catch&#34;, so we are even. The rating strictly applies to the DVD functionality. Make sure you immediately play all DVDs so you can make sure they all work. I gave this as a gift, and my wife did not play them all until months later, when she found out one of the discs were defective. We got an exchange after some arm twisting. Amazon actually wanted to charge us a restock fee. For what? your going to resell a defective DVD? They got over their &#34;duh&#34; moment and did not charge us the restock fee.
B009VB97EY|5.0|The guys were hot I will probly buy this move. Altho the story line was kinda dumb but lets face it i just wanted to see Channing Tatums ass. Which is like the first sceen by the way
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so much fun. It is sort of like Temple Run.You collect coins and try to dodge an inspector. You can get it for free too!
B00AG297GK|3.0|Expecting more...just wasn't as good as his other stuff.  It was a good rental.  That is about it.  It's ok.
B00CXN2JNS|3.0|If you read thru most of these reviews you get a pretty good idea that the album is just average. Not as great as Endgame, but not even close to as bad as Risk. I bought the cd, since I own all their other albums, have seen them live twice, met Mustaine after a concert, and they're my fav band. However that doesn't mean I like everything about this album. Some flaws other reviews haven't pointed out yet are 1) the bad decision to make the title track Super Collider the lead single. If they had made Kingmaker or Don't Turn Your Back the lead single, it probably would've led to better initial reviews/boosted cd sales. 2)The track order is very poor. Kingmaker is a good start, but Super Collider kills the momentum. I think they could've followed Kingmaker with Don't Turn Your Back, then Burn, then Cold Sweat, then Built for War, then Off the Edge, then Dance in the Rain. I feel the title track and tracks 7-9 should not have been put on this album. But even the aforementioned track re-ordering would've created a different flow to this album. 3) There are almost no guitar solos on here, which I believe is the hallmark of Megadeth's music. And 4) they need to bring back Producer Andy Sneap. He oversaw the work on both United Abominations and Endgame, which not coincidentally had better direction and sound. Their last 2 releases, 13 and this new album make them sound like they lost their way a little and my feeling is that its because Andy Sneap didn't produce the last 2 releases.<br /><br />Overall I still find it decent enough to buy. Another reviewer put it best by saying even an average Megadeth cd crushes 99% of all the other stuff out there today in hard rock/metal. I also agree with another reviewer that I am glad Megadeth consistently releases cd's every year or two, compared with Metallica who only does a new cd about once every 6-10 years now.
B00992CF6W|4.0|thar are hardly ever any updates I wish they could update it to be more like the computer version but it is a prity good game.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Okay, so I haven't given any of the books in this series 5 stars and I was not a huge fan when I read the first book...BUT, I am on board more now. I first read Bared To You right after I finished the Fifty Shades series and I thought it was way too similiar. Now, I am not so sure they are and I have really have enjoyed Eva and Gideon. There are some things I was not a big fan of in this book but all of it created drama which made me want to read more. I also really enjoy the other character's in the book...Cary, Trey, not a fan of Tatiana, but I like Megumi, Mark and Steven. I also seem to always want the story to go on when I read a good trilogy so I am kinda glad it's not over yet. However, I do think it is time for a happy ending for Eva and Gideon (they have been through enough!)so I hope we get that in the next book and then maybe make book five focused on one or more of the other characters we have grown to love in these books, epecially Cary. Even though I am also not a big fan of Eva's mom, I think something else if keeping her from Victor and I want them to end up together. Finally, the price...yes Sylvia Day's book are a higher cost then most but she is also a well establish author that should be able to sell her books for what she thinks they are worth. If you don't like it, don't buy them...it's that simple! Besides, you will pay way more for these books in print. Get over it!
B001FB55I0|5.0|This movie is rather dark in tone, but stay with it and you'll be rewarded with an in-depth story, good action, and some nice twists and turns. Never saw this movie when it was playing in theaters. Reviews were mixed, many because of the somewhat solemn, desperate nature of the characters - but that adds richness to the story! Grab some popcorn and see if you can figure out what happens next .....
B00190OHD6|5.0|I have this movie on DvD but forgot to bring it when I went on vacation. Me and a friend wished to watch it so we decided to do a quick rental! I typically download videos or whatever when purchasing on amazon video since the downloads are very fast and you do not have to worry about internet issues once the movie is on the computer! Such a nice option to have :)<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie, just buy it! Or rent it I guess. But you'll buy it anyways so why wait?<br /><br />Note: Be ready to cry. I have seen this movie many times and have cried at least once each viewing :3
B0083Z614S|5.0|I would recommend this read to anyone interested in renewal of life and hope and health; Beautiful underlying themes that give the reader a sense of hope.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever so fun and there is going to be a good update get it you can even join on other people's worlds if they are close
B00003CXTG|5.0|great movie. Its a sad movie but i love it and can watch it 20 times a day.. still do lol..
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like the idea that you can drown out other sounds and enjoy the relaxing sounds of the  spa sound maker
B001XUT6AG|5.0|Cheesy, philosophical, and a galaxy full of human aliens, The Undiscovered Country is what Star Trek's all about. You don't watch it because it's realistic. You watch it because it's good.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|When i was a teenager and living in the West Village (NYC) all of us were if love with the movie--not the violence but the dancing and of course the love between Tony and Maria.  It was years later that I learned that the story was a modernization of Shakespears Romeo and Juliet.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We have been watching this show every night! The quality of the transmission is better than Netflix! and the show itself is wonderful! Love it!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Wow, I've been such a fan of these books and Charlaine Harris. I have every Sookie Stackhouse novel except for DeadLocked and Dead Ever Afer. I felt so bad for not getting them right away, like I had before with the other books, but I was very hesitant to buy them after Dead Reckoning and Dead in the Family. Those two weren't terrible but they were definitely, not as good as the rest! Now, I was decided to but these two last novel but after all the reviews and spoiler I've read I am not going to be buying them! I would rather have Dead in the family as my last Sookie book, then those. How could Charlaine Harris be so inconsiderate with her books, her world, and her fans?<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Eric. A huge fan of Eric and Sooki, but even though I am, I never really thought they would have ended together. And after reading these spoilers and knowing what Charlaine did to Eric'c, and Sookies individual characters I am very DISAPPOINTED. I will definitely not be buy any of her novels again. If she can destroy these great characters and these great story lines in one or two books, what kinds of writer is she? Not a very great one. If she was going to do this, she should have ended this series a long time ago, when they would have actually been good. I Am not going to be wasting money- making someone rich for crappy writing.<br />I'm Sorry Charlaine but you've lost a reader here. Hopefully you find a way to redeem yourself and your writing.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Purchased for my daughter, she loves it. Good quality. We enjoyed the movie. Can't wait for the next one. She is into archery.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like it,because my Kindle fire HD doesn't show the battery life but now it does! I recommend this app this app for anybody who has a Kindle fire HD.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was really challenging and an interesting game to play through  with really hard chapters that kept you hooked throughout the game<br />.
B000UDNBQW|5.0|You may pause about reading this book, but if you've taken the privilege of reading Dickens, and in particular, Great Expectations, you MUST read Mr. PIP. To make the decision not to do so would be a travesty. You relive Pip' s story and gain an appreciation for the amazing writing of Lloyd Jones.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I own the VHS version and realized that I hadn't upgraded to a DVD.  My kids and I are very happy.  Thank you.
B00BF11STU|3.0|The movie does a good job of walking through real events that led to the capture, but fails by itself to be a compelling film.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Richard Feynman is a great man and it is amazing his outlook on life.  I can see how some people may find him unusual or unlikable.  His way of thinking is being lost in the world and we need more people like him.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Although, I was wanting a ending I am not disappointed there are more.  Gideon and Eva's story is raw it couldn't end so abruptly with all the twists and turns it takes.  Now the wait for book 4 :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I would recommend this app to all my friends but most of them already have it
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Great copy, no complaints. Just what I ordered. Movie for my younger sister but she was happy with the purchase.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is a great buy and hard to put down once you get started. I bought the whole series and definitely recommend buying it since you will want the next book immediately. My shipment arrived on time and the set was in excellent condition.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Get it.. It will be good purchase and you will not repent it. Definitely charges quicker than the USB one.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|I say this because I like a lot of people was very interested in this movie. because the lord of the rings trilogy had been so outstanding. but when I started to watch this I swear I nearly fell asleep in the first 30 min because it was boring. I mean I am all for spending time in Bilbo's house but not for 45min where really nothing of consequence happens besides meeting Gandalf and the dwarves. then when the FINALLY started to move the plot along nothing really happened. I mean they when to moria and got captured by goblins then escape. they fight for about 5min and Bilbo says like he is just the best warrior ever &#34;I will help you get your home back&#34;. ok very boring plot, then for the so called special effects that everybody and there mother was saying where amazing. no thy where not because they really didn't do anything that need special effects and besides that I personally think that the original trilogy was a thousand times better than this because when they did use special effects it helped move the plot not show off how awesome the tech crews where because they could make them. in short I will not be getting nor seeing anymore in this  trilogy and still don't get why it grossed over a billion dollars
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|Greed....it all comes down to Greed!<br />This kind of thing has to be stopped......so lets stop it with our dollars!
0575096624|1.0|If CH claims that she wrote this book, I will take her at her word.  Unfortunately it feels like someone completely unfamiliar with the SVM series generated this piece of garbage.
B000002J0B|5.0|There's a reason they call led zep the gods of rock just listen to the houses of the holy. All the songs sound different but somehow flow together nice. All kind of different styles, rock, blues, folk, disco, blue grass sometimes in the same song. Some much talent and just so original. We really need this in rock now a days. It's almost forty years old but still sounds fresh as it ever did. A amazing album by a amazing band!
B005J4TLN4|3.0|A classic plot line in American Westerns is the \\"defend your land\\" scenario where a small group (usually a family) needs to fight against some outsiders (be they bloodthirsty Apaches or rival ranchers or a vengeful gang of criminals) who want to muscle in. The plot has been used again and again in many genres. One recent entry is Joe Cornish's Attack the Block, a science fiction alien invasion version of the story.<br /><br />Set in south London, the story begins with a gang of young hoodies who mug a woman on Guy Fawkes Night (which explains the fireworks in the sky). They get interrupted by something crashing down from the sky that's not a firework. The object wrecks a car. The head hoodie, a boy named Moses, investigates the car and discovers some kind of wolf/dog monster who scratches him up. Moses and his posse hunt down the creature. After they kill it, they realize it must be some alien and they think they can cash in if they find some interested scientist or TV program. So they head to the safest spot they know, the local drug dealer's \\"weed room,\\" where he grows marijuana. They run into Hi-Hatz, the sadistic drug lord for the neighborhood. Hi-Hatz recruits Moses to sell for him, giving Moses a small amount of drugs. The boys have bigger problems when more alien creatures come crashing down and threaten the 'hood.<br /><br />The movie is standard B-movie fare--the creatures are scary but not too scary; the comedy is okay but not great; bigger issues (in this case racism) are touched on but not dealt with in depth. The story keeps viewers engaged because the characters are more like real people than like stereotypes or archetypes (though the aliens are pretty one-dimensional). Even though the gang is very unsympathetic at the beginning, they show a lot more of their humanity and vulnerability as the story goes on.<br /><br />The woman they mugged is an ongoing character. When she is reunited with the gang through circumstance, their interactions are real andthey come to understand each other better. This plot line provides a center to the movie that keeps it from being too cliched or too formulaic or too uninteresting. The realness of the relationships raises this to the high end of the B-movie category.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I can't wait until the next season comes out! Game of thrones is one of the best TV series out today
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|The app is good and fun to play however most of the other players don't draw they just write the word of the item they should be DRAWING, so not as fun as it could be.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The seventh season of Dexter keeps getting better and better. I can't wait for the final season to come out on Showtime at the end of the month.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I found this to be one of the bet Reacher novels so far. Lee Child has not been trapped into writing by formula. Each book is very different from the last.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Really keeps you coming back for more... and my wife likes it too so not just a show for guys.  It can be a bit rough as far as language, violence, and some exposure to drugs so you may want to keep the kids out of the room if they are pre-teens.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It was a.descent game ALOT like ALOT of others like right.now but still fair with decent graphics. Still my kid likes it ALOT.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|You are talking about something that I have been looking for and this was the free app of the day. Let me tell you this needs to be advertised it is a great app. I have used this over 10 times in the last 3weeks I have had it installed on my phone. If you need access to your computer remotely this is a great tool to have.
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a master story-teller. whilst his books lack depth, his characters tend towards the superficial, his plots are well constructed and he has the ability to keep the plot unfolding sufficiently well as for the book to be difficult to put down.
0142410705|5.0|I loved the summary from the start, and John Green is an amazing author. This story is about a guy who has only ever dated girls named Katherine starting from elementary school. When his 19th Katherine breaks up with him, he is devastated because he felt that this time it was different. His friend decides they need to go on a healing road trip where they find a small town, that's based off of a tampon string factory! They get jobs there and decide where to go from there...<br />The ending will not dissapoint.
B003GK223E|3.0|Since the plot is about a well-known person, there is little surprise in the story, only in the quality of its telling. Archer's characters are flat cariactures based  on publicly known people and superficially portrayed. It's merit is only in the telling.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|My wife heard one song on the radio. When we searched for the song we found this CD. She loved the entire CD and has had it in her car CD player constantly for the last 10 days.

This is an excellent book.  The black and white pictures are simple. Variations for differing levels of difficulty are explained. Workout wherever you are;  your own body is your gift!

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fun game with many different puzzles to solve. Good graphics and story line. Looking forward to playing many more G 5 games.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Between this and Jorge, Business Calendar really is worth every penny. The options and widgets are there to be used and are fully functional. I have used it on my Droid X, Droid X2, Droid Incredible 2, Samsung Galaxy 3, and Nexus 7 tablet.<br /><br />My only issue is I got it on Amazon and either the developer or Amazon does not keep up with the same update as in Google Play. I hate paying twice for same app.<br /><br />Developer if you can help with the updates in any way (newest was for Japanese language which I don't need).
B00000IREA|4.0|At the time this movie was made they did the best they could with the graphic technology they had back then, this movie is both cheesy and funny at the same time, I recommend if you like Jane Fonda.
1577314808|5.0|Something you need to keep and read over and over. I am not reading it quickly so I can infiltrate the messages. Still reading it.

B004FQX5CK|5.0|An ultimate movie in an ultimate (until a new one comes along) format, BluRay.<br />'The Final Cut' was pretty-much a come-on; the same movie with snips of<br />a few seconds (seemed like it, but maybe more) extensions.<br /><br />Video, audio, all bettered, but not significantly/overwhelmingly.<br /><br />Overall, worth the re-buy, if one has bucks to burn.<br /><br />If one's a rabid fan, then the new version comes along. (But a final final cut<br />won't grab me next time . . .
