B005LAJ212|5.0|As this is the second season, it's nice to go back and refresh yourself as to who is doing what to whom.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|although it is a little disturbing as a Mother and Grandmother, it raises questions worh considering if one of your<br />own were in a position such as Jacob...how would you react...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So much fun to play! Graphics are great and it's like having your own pet horse! I highly recommend it (:
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I chose this rating because it starts charging for items right away.  Not good idea for young children.<br /><br />Can't find the delete button for removing this  app from my kindle.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I bought this movie because I saw the actual broadway show and I must say I love this movie just as much as the regular show! Its a good movie filled with great songs. The dvd arrived in perfect condition!
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a super fun game!  Very addictive and challenging enough to keep the replayability high.  And the game is also easy enough for even my 3-year old daughter to have fun playing it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Really good. Great. Deviates from the television series so reading is fun and also helps explain what the heck is really going on in that TV series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this little game of escape very fun and very challenging and I am really enjoying figuring out the puzzles
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I've been waiting for this release for years. The only thing wrong with it is that it isn't a double album.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|Good story line but doesn't have that great of a flow and can be confusing at times. It needed better directing. The characters are good.
0061452068|5.0|This book changed the way I see the world.  Matt Ridley paints a vivid picture of humankind's progress over the millenniums and should give everyone hope for the future.  I've bought a few copies for friends and forced them to read it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent read. A absolute page turner. I can see now why Apple products are as great as they are. We'll miss you Steve.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesine read its like an erotic novel, thriller,and mystery all in one! Definitely reading  rest if the trilogy just to find out what complicates  Mr. Grey so.  :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is lots of fun, download and you won't regret it. Be sure to get the flamingos in the game.
0007466064|5.0|Got tired of waiting for this one to be published in paperback here in the states.  So I ordered this paperback version (and part 2)  that came out overseas.<br />Only flaw is that they're not the same size as the other GoT paperbacks on my shelf.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Easy way to track the battery life in our son's Kindle without going to the main menu.  Recommend to anyone with a Kindle or tablet.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I had no idea what this book was about but I bought it because it was a  New York Times best seller... I cried too many times but kept reading. It was very touching. I wouldn't recommend reading this  at work (because of the crying) but it's a great read.
0385349947|5.0|I love this book - very interesting but, even though I know that the author is writing to enlighten us, it is hard not to become angry while reading it as it makes even clearer the differences that women and men are raised with. Have to read and process only a bit at a time and try to work past anger and work towards empowerment.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|When this album was released i didn't pay attention because the singles were the same electropop that Ke$ha always delivers. But i gave the album an opportunity and there are some great pop songs with rock influences, for example Dirty Love and Only Wanna Dance With You. I'm enjoying this! It's my Guilty pleasure! Well Done K$!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|WOW!  I could not put my Kindle down until I watched the entire video.  It was not what I expected, but I did thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game is so much fun! I love playing it to pass time when I'm bored its alot of fun
B002VNFNTC|4.0|This ain't no happy memoir. A slice of real life Charles Bukowski style. Don't feel sorry for him, just read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i think that there should be another NEW update and there should be dogs, a button that should be able to let you sit down, more food, and some really cool actual fruniture! DO IT
B009NXV51S|1.0|The movie is great.<br /><br />The stream was horrible. I have a fast connection but Amazon still slowed down the stream to bad quality.
B001N9ESQ4|3.0|This sequel to Before Sunrise is good, but lacks some of the spontaneity of the original.  Hawke's character is not as expressive and interesting as the original, nor is the acting quite up to par with his job nine years earlier.  Nonetheless, it is worth seeing.
B00BESM14U|4.0|this was a quirky movie and had an overall good synopsis. it wasn't your normal teen movie, good for any age
B001NA6096|4.0|If you enjoy two people falling in love and like interchange between them as they grow on each other, you will like this movie.  The dialogue is quite realistic and keeps up a good pace.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute being the operative word here.  If you're looking for hot sex, this book doesn't have it.  The storyline was a bit far fetched, but still kept me reading.  I would recommend it for an easy, light, &#34;cute&#34; story.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Its good looking and very practile. It has a good feel and fits the Kindle perfect. I would want anything else. Thanks for it.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|loved the movie, his life , his aches and pains of aging were right on. the scout pulled it all together
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show, can't wait  for more episodes!!!!  I enjoy most post apocalyptic shows, and this has not disappointed!  Love it.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I enjoyed this very much! Read it straight through and liked everything about it. I got the feel that each character was a real person and was sorry to see it end.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Made me go back and watch the first two movies.  Summer Glau is excellent.  Was slightly skeptical of the casting of the former 90210 star, but he does good.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I loved it! I would watch more than one episode at a time. I love paranormal and some science fiction and I would reccomend this series to anyone that likes action, suspence and seeing the unbelieveable with just the right amount of romance...story lines great...each one you become more invested in the characters...<br />Love it!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it challenging game makes you think on your feet. Recommended for all ages. Cant WAIT for more boards. Thumbs up
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I got hooked at book one and really enjoyed the journey. The characters are quite developed and even if some of them are truly unlikeable, they certainly kept me page turning. They are great fun and provide total escapism. Looking forward to the next book.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Love the songs on the CD. I have favorites but like them all.the, I remember like it was yesterday that we took our 8 yr old (now 33 yrs old) to their concert in St. Louis.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|A friend told me to read these books and that I would be hooked.  I am!  I have also begun the TV seiries
B003L20IJM|5.0|This movie was a pleasure to watch once again since so much of it is tongue-in-cheek. Emma Thompson also reprised the role well.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Can't wait to continue with season 2.  Acting and plots are fantastic.  Set designs and everything keep me interested.  On to season 2.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|quite a complex story ,easy to understand in places , very difficult to understand in others , still to complete<br /><br />regards  eugene meyler
B0081336FO|5.0|I've watched this over a few times.  Enjoy the series immensely.  Now just need more episodes to watch. Great acting.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Great reading.  Many twists and turns, all brought together with skill.  Unlike many present day authors, the novel does not feel rushed to an unnatural ending.
034580404X|5.0|I heard so much about the book, when it first came out and I must admit I had no interest.  But one day a came across a copy my son's friend had left, so I started reading it and I was hooked.  I could not put the book down, when I finished the book, I was really bummed out cause it was fun summer reading.  Boy what a surprise when I found<br />out it had two sequels, OMG I was thrilled.  I am reading the last phase of the story, boy It really has a story<br />too.  The bondage and all the stuff Its fine, I don't get all the hype, its fun its interesting, I feel like I am in<br />another world.  I love Christian & Ana.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This is a fun show to watch.  Both main actors are great and the story works.  I got to spend some time watching a show with my 20 year old daughter who is always doing her own thing.  She actually went online to watch more episodes and is now ahead of me, so it was good while it lasted.  Good show, good actors, good stories.
037582913X|5.0|My toddler loves being told the story about the monster hiding at the end of the book.  Be warned, however... Grover will impede you every step of the way.  You may wish to ask your son for help when Grover attempts to use brick and mortar.  Toddlers are inhumanly strong.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|In the words of the great late Dick Cavett,  Not Bad<br />Better than most music nowdays. All the songs are good, some are great.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is a game l enjoy I have played on and off but always come Back to play. when I play I get caught up in it and forget the time....  :)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie shines as a beacon of fantastic acting and production. It tells a story that is real and true, and it does it in a way that has you at time, at the edge of your seat. Great movie.
0425263924|1.0|I loved the first two books in this series, and was so excited when Entwined with you was released! I am very disappointed. I found myself having to make myself read the book! It lacked the anticipation and luster in the first two, and the story line was drawn out. The book abruptly ends leading to a 4th book. I am not sure what in the world could be in the 4th book that would make it any more interesting than the 3rd! Sylvia lost sight and ruined a great series with this one!!!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Don't be fooled. This movie is a political thriller (If you are looking for a Civil War movie, this is not it), it is slow paced and very direct about its purpose. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is absolutely amazing, as is the performance Tommy Lee Jones.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I didn't think that Muse would ever make a better album than 'Black Holes and Revelations.' They have. This is it. Buy it.
B001L2EE9Y|5.0|I'm not much of a writer, certainly not gifted enough to describe Joni Mitchell's work with sufficient skill...  I just find her music so soothing, and this is by far my favorite album.  Favorite cut?  A Case of You.  It's just perfection.
B00867GHS8|5.0|With Disney / Pixar, you typically have to buy the 5-disc set to get the digital copy. This annoys me because you end up having all of these discs that you don't need (we don't have a 3D DVD player), but this purchase was totally worth it for us.<br /><br />It's a great movie and we love watching it with our daughter. The colors are phenomenal and we love that we can take it anywhere with us.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|more poppy than the quirky older stuff, but still a great time to be had by listening to this CD.  Came on time and in great condition.  thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's good game we have lots of fun me and my two boys. We play as a competition to break each other's high records.  Try it and you will not regret it!
B004UUKDNA|5.0|came on time and in great condition, thanks.  I was expecting more songs like the one on the radio.. but enjoyed the CD nonetheless.
B004SCN2F6|4.0|Can be somewhat monotonous  at times and slightly frustrating when your pilot dies, but is overall a well made and enjoyable game.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|more mainstream than the earlier indie stuff, but a great CD regardless.  Came in great condition, a bit later than I expected but only because I didn't realize it was an import.
0062202081|5.0|This book is great! Lots of pictures, great story of a determined, inspiring young man. Great buy! Look forward to his next book...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this, because I love horses, so it's perfect for me. I love watching my horse and playing with it.I
0425263908|1.0|This book mirrors 50 Shades, or tries to.  I found it a book about sex and two messed up people.  Not at all a love story or even a story for that matter.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|Instead of using water cooler, I chose this for the new build to work with i7 3770K.  It is a big cooler and makes sure your case will fit.  Installation is somehow tricky but easy to get around.  I add an additional fan to improve the air flow which it should come with.  This is an older model and the newer model is EVO.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I love the graphics and the game play. You fill you cars with animal and the more you keep in the more coins you collect. Collecting the hearts is also fun. There is no creating roller coasters you just have to navagate how fast your coaster goes. Each coaster presents another challenge that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Thank you for creating  this colorful roller coaster game that I'm addicted to.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Fans of the series will find a little closure in finding out what happens to Sookie and Erik, but overall I was unimpressed with the story. It was hard to get through the last 1/3 of the book, which seemed rushed. The story lines are completely out of character from the rest of the series, and (spoiler alert!) Sookie's relationship with Sam seems awkward and forced.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would really Recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. It<br />IS<br />FABULOUS<br /><br />GO READ  IT NOW<br /><br />PLEAS
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Very good thriller, with lots of action performed by Neeson, a sort of all-purpose spy kind of guy.  He searches for his abducted daughter through the Paris area.  He's not quite James Bond, but he's close.
0756405890|4.0|Great read if you can push through the first several chapters and his time in one the first major towns.
B001XULSG6|4.0|The movie quality was good with no interruptions. For the next generation Star Trek... I would recommend this movie to those interested in science fiction.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Captivating in every aspect. Characters and actors are superb.  I am waiting for Season 4.<br />The history of Dowton Abbey makes the series more enjoyable.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|When I first started watching the Walking Dead, it found it VERY interesting and exciting. Could not wait for the next episode every week. I would watch this with my daughter every Sunday night. Since I had not seen the first 2 seasons of this amazing mini series.. I knew I had to find out just exactly how this thing started and what had happened leading up to Season 3. I found myself watching one episode after another, only stopping for sleep. I had finished up the whole season in a matter of days. If you are a Walking Dead Fan and have not seen Season 2, than this is for you and worth penny.
0446547603|3.0|The product quality and shipping was GREAT! No complaint about that. I'm disappointed with the book. I love Nicholas Sparks but this was the first book I wasn't impressed with.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very much enjoyed this movie because it is &#34;off the beaten path&#34;. This is not a &#34;shoot em up&#34; or car chase movie by any means. The story flows very smoothly and the main role that is played by a young man was done excellent. It is my understanding that this was the first movie that this actor has ever been in. Very realistic and the scenery in the movie footage was stunning. Not sure how much of the scenes was computer generated and how much was real, but most of this movie is very pleasing to the eyes. Of the myriad of things I like about this movie, the thing i enjoyed the most is that the movie kind of &#34;tells a story&#34; and has a moral to it. The boy in the movie is faced with extreme adversity and his spirituality is relied on many times over to help him get through his situations. Many would say the outcome was a Miracle, I know I would say it was
0446547646|5.0|My favorite author is Nicholas Sparks. He does an amazing job. This book was well written and easy to read.
B00845PV16|3.0|Not bad if your bored and dont have much of anything else to watch.  If you have other options, go with them.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|games like leaft 4 dead 2, Battlefield 3 run fine with this processor and APU technology: D they recommend if you do not have a budget for a good video card
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is riveting and had me glued to it from start to finish. I started this book one day and had completed reading it the very next day. It is so interesting that I simply could not put the book down, except for to sleep. This neurosurgeons unique experience of visiting Heaven and being led through different levels of Heaven by Angels is unforgettable. Told from the author's view of what he experienced while going through a serious life threatening event, this book can open the eyes of those who do not believe in God or in Heaven. As much as I would like to go further into detail about what happens to the author during his &#34;near-death&#34; experience I will refrain from giving up too much info as to not spoil the story for whoever decides to read this. This is non fiction and worth every penny spent on it.  I could actually see this being made into a movie and it would be one that families would enjoy together.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I got about a 1/3 of the way through and thought, this better get a lot more exciting pretty quickly. Every time something exciting and full of action started to happen it just fizzled out. I hated this book. When I finished the last page and realized that was the end I was so ticked I would have thrown the book if I would have been reading it in paperback instead of a Kindle. Big disappointment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Of course another great read. Sparks is a great writer. Great love story. Of course much better than the movie.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|This should be the last stand for the cast of this dreadful movie.<br />The &#34;plot&#34; is wafer thin. Every character is a stereotype and the acting is woeful.<br />I was horrified to see Forest Whitaker in this rubbish - he is way too good an actor.<br />It has action sequences but they are trite and nothing you have not seen before.<br />Complete waste of time and money..
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Not at all what I expected.  Not exactly sad, but very poignant.  Some of the characters were not very well explained, but the story was generally well told.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|allosaurus was a surprise gift, grandson loves it and plays wit it everywhere. rough play is no problem..paint has lasted
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Confused and disorganized.  Totally unwatchable.  I suppose it is possible it become better later in the movie, but I was not able to get that far.
B004LM72ZY|4.0|It says for children 1.5 years & up... a 1.5 year old certainly wouldn't be able to twist the two pieces of the rocket ship off and on.. our little guy LOVES this toy, but just has to ask us to open it - then he loves taking the little astronaut in & out - then hands it back to me to close it. Which is totally fine.. but it's just not something the child could do at this age without someone's help.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|this show is so realistic and all of the article discussed is great. Year after the year it does not lose it's snap.  I love this show.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Ryan gosling is hilarious, and gorgeous. This movie is so funny! There is one scene that I watched over and over till I was in pain from laughing! Do yourself s favor, and watch this tonight!!!
B005D6O0LQ|5.0|I love these shoes.  I bought 3 different colors and wear them all summer long.  I wear a size 9, but buy a size 8.  After a little wear they stretch out a bit.  They are very comfortable for walking, jogging and even look cute with sun dresses.  They're great for water and boat shoes.  People think of these big ugly oversized shoes when they hear Crocs, but these are dainty, but rugged....the perfect shoe for me.  I even have a pair I wear just inside.  They don't hurt your wood floors.
B0002WZTPC|3.0|In the final fight scene when Maverick shows up to save the day, the music played is NOT the original music. Instead, it sounds like some amateur, cheesy, dog-dropping garbage that someone composed with their midi player. This really irks the hell out of me.<br /><br />Also, I suspect (because I no longer have my old VHS for comparison) some Pepsi product placements and other items may have been added to the movie. For example, when the ATC officer stomps out of Viper's office and collides with the 1st class PO spilling the tray of sodas, for the first time (and I've seen this movie lots of times), I noticed the tray had a big Pepsi symbol on it.<br /><br />Speaking of Pepsi, this set does NOT have the old Pepsi commercial in it. My old VHS tape did.<br /><br />The \\"making of Top Gun\\" videos were interesting though.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Added to my collection with all of the other seasons. great quality of video. Cant wait until next season begins
B002YVAT72|5.0|Easy to setup and use. Have recommended it to friends. It worked perfectly, and I would also buy the tape to digital unit.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|The Rod Stewart albums are beginning to sound all the same - regardless of the season. I probably won't bring it out next Christmas.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I loved this movie when I was younger, and I enjoyed it just as much now. Brings back plenty of memories.
B00CLZ48FA|2.0|The CGI effects are great, and the movie is beautiful, which is expected from Disney. However, the dialog is so horrible, I'd hate to see what was left on the cutting-room floor if the final product was the best. More than once I found myself cringing because of the dialog, which is bland, choppy and trite, far more so than usual for a Disney film, which made it difficult to sit through the entire movie in one sitting. I turned it off about halfway through the night I rented it (I rented this via Amazon Instant Video) because the movie was too torturous to continue watching. I don't blame the actors-- the acting was good as well as the casting, costuming, make-up and special effects--it's just the script sucked so badly it put the tornado to shame. I was actually embarrassed FOR the actors for having to say the lines they were given. It was only out of sheer curiosity about the ending that I finished watching it the next night, and was pleasantly surprised that the final battle between the Wizard Oz and the Wicked Witch Sisters was not half as bad as the story leading up to that point. That Evanora and Theodora, the Wicked Witches of West and East, were written to be vamps seemed inappropriate for these characters and the nature of the film. I never read the original books, so I may be wrong about this.<br /><br />I gave this film 2 stars for the effects and the final battle.  I would not recommend this film in its entirety to anyone, but I do recommend watching the big battle for the Emerald City and see how the Wizard of Oz came to be the 'man behind the curtain', which is the last 20 minutes of the film.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|A forgotten look at the past that is full of a lot of emotion.  Too many movies being made that are set into the future but this one is one that takes us back into the past for some rattling realities.  Regardless if you are old enough to appreciate the history, you will still find this movie full of entertainment.  Great performances from an all star cast and to me, I really enjoyed the memories it brought back.  Although this type of racism was exclusive of the deep south state of Mississippi  where violent bigotry was the mainstream and many movies have been made about the horrors of racism in Mississippi, I have wonderful memories of our family having &#34;help&#34; during the 60's only it was much more of a family type relationship where they were part of our family and sat with us during meals and were part of my fondest childhood memories.  It was a time when everyone had to pull together to make ends meet when white families were so large and depended on farms and the Blacks would become extended parts of the family for their own survival as well and were never treated as less than we were.  It was just everyone helping each other as I innocently remember it and this movie brings back wonderful memories of those times.  Shame on Mississippi for their HATE and Violence and their behavior that has given life to so much animosity between the races over the decades that spilled into neighboring states.  Great Movie everyone should watch with an open mind and not to allow the sins of a few keep hatred alive.

B00992CF6W|2.0|What you want me to put that I going to enjoy the games want I don't play to much. I am 18 year-old.
B000JCSBU0|4.0|My son who is a heroin addict recommended this film after told him I watched Trainspotting. One day from jail he said \\"if you really want to know what it's like, watch Requiem for a Dream\\". I wasn't sure watch to expect nor was I ready for what I saw. Being an RN I have seen my share of addiction and what it looks like, but the graphic visual experience takes it to a new level. Coming from my son, I believe that the emotions, pain and torment are as real as depicted. I won't go into much more about the film, because I think the other reviews do a great job. Every parent who has a child with an addiction should watch this horrific film, but only when they are mentally prepared for the hard reality of it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I couldn't put the book down. Very interesting easy read. The author is now a new favorite.  I will be checking into other titles.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|This book was too gruesome, although I'm sure a good read for those who like this sort, torture repeated over and over is depressing. Glad I'm done with this one!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Aristocrats!  Manor house!  The inter-war years!  All that's missing is a murder and a detective and this would be perfect!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is totally worth the price!! You can run around and do what you want and best up people!!! Easy to get in game money and is around epic game!!!!!!! I love it
B003YL4LYI|2.0|i was ticked when the 4th book didn't finish the series, as promised.  I became truly pissed after I read ADWD and found an amazing lack of progress in the story.  After coming to Amazon to check on progress, hoping against despair that the series might conclude, I find that a total of 12 books are expected. I'm finished with GRRM, who cannot keep his promises.
B005EVVEPK|5.0|Love this cd...it grows on you. You will find alot of catchey songs here. The guitars are dreamy..Both of their cd are great
B004I654WQ|5.0|Bought for my son's Father's Day gift.  Even though he is 35 he was excited to get the movie.  He will watch it with his family.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I enjoyed the series, not crazy about the last two books but thought the last book in the series would be good.  I was wrong it was slow and boring. Where were the characters we knew and loved (or hated) but made the books interesting and a fun read.  Sorry it ended in such a way.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|On the cover of the 1987 Ace edition of Dune, the novel is touted as \\"Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece.\\" Yet for many years, I pointedly avoided the two or three shelves at the local bookstores inhabited by Frank Herbert's renowned series.  I had always found the premise of royal intrigue in the setting of a vast desert wasteland with enormous worms as the feature alien life to be bland and uninteresting.  As a teenager who was treated to Michael Keaton in the movie Beatlejuice, I could not help to draw a parallel to the works of Dune.  Then, I picked the book up at a used bookstore and threw it into a pile of seven other books to read while on a beach trip.  I never picked up the other six.<br /> My first impression of the novel was its density.  I often read books rather quickly, but I had to slow myself for this novel.  Herbert introduces us to an immense world, and we are rushed headlong into this world without the crutch of explanations.  In the very first scene, we are introduced to Paul Atreides, his mother the Lady Jessica, and the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.  We are introduced to the terms Bene Gesserit, Kwisatz Haderach, and Gom Jabbar within the first page.  The world develops quickly, opening with Paul proving himself to the wily Reverend Mother through the terrible ordeal of the Gom Jabbar; and this was a hook worthy of the best books of all time.<br /> First and foremost, Herbert created in Dune an absolute triumph in world building.  This world is truly unique.  We find ourselves in the setting of a true space opera with all of the fun of courtly intrigues.  This world is truly immense, and it would take well over two hundred pages to give even a brief glimpse of all of the intricate details of this universe (and bore us in the process).  Herbert instead takes us along the ride, allowing interactions and action of the plot to give us details about his world.  We learn along the way about the prolonged feud of House Atreides and House Harkonnen, now devolving into the formal house warfare of kanly, even as Harkonnen loses the fief of the spice planet Arrakis to Atreides.  We are given clues along the way of the terrible Butlerian Jihad of eons past that resulted in the current world without computers (Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind).  We learn about the wonders of swordmasters, , mentats, and the Prana Bindu; and of course about the geriatric spice, m&eacute;lange, around which the universe revolves.  This world is simply awesome.<br /> Too often, however, a science fiction book falls victim to the trap of world building.  Many well-meaning authors treat it as a means and an ends, sacrificing the plot and the character building in the process.  Herbert avoids such pitfalls in Dune. Paul Atreides, as a main character, is as well written, and as well developed as any character in science fiction.  Herbert does well to show in his actions, dialogue, and responses to the world around him, that Paul is just a kid at the beginning of the book.  However, during the course of the events that lead to his sudden and nearly-complete destruction, we see him change rather dramatically from victim of a universe against him into the triumphant hero (and tyrant?).<br /> Outside of Paul, we are introduced to a cadre of wonderful and memorable characters, even if only briefly.  The men arrayed around Paul, hired to teach him to fight, to politic, and to survive intrigue, are some of the more interesting secondary characters I have read.  Ducan Idaho, Gurney Hallack, Thufir Hawat, and even the Duke Leto Atreides, Paul's father, all contribute a wonderful color to the novel.  To discuss each, would take several days to analyze each one.  In each character, Herbert gives us hard fighting men, trained to kill on the slightest provocation, but each with a true character and even a soft spot (usually centered around the boy Paul).  Each man is shown to be a true warrior, but from the ballisetto the spice beer, Herbert gives the men soft nuances.  This character writing is so often lacking in science fiction, it stands out all the more in this novel.<br />The women of Paul's life are equally impressive as well.  From the Lady Jessica, we get our closest glimpse of the Bene Gesserit.  Through her we also get the most insightful interplays with Paul to gain insight into his change from the ducal heir to the Kwisatz Haderach.  Herbert writes in Chani the perfect mate to Paul.  She is the hard fremen of the desert, his clear superior when they meet, and his most devoted lover when the book closes.<br />Finally, like any good science fiction or fantasy novel, we needed a bad guy.  Herbert delivers with perhaps one of the more purely evil characters in the history of literature with the Baron Vladamir Harkonnen.  He is the pure antithesis of the Atreides in every way and form.  He is grossly over-fat, to the point of needed a suspensor to aid his walking, where the Atreides men are lean and muscular warriors.  He kills at the slightest provocation, where the Atreides are known for gaining loyalty without murder.  The Baron takes everything and twists it to evil, as in his mentat Piter De Vries, and in his heirs the na-Baron Feyd Rautha and the Beast Rabban.  All is evil around this man, the Baron Vladamir Harkonnen.  Even to say his name makes you almost shudder.<br />Having mastered the art of world building and the creation of memorable characters, Herbert then delivers the third strike with a very engaging plot.  Others have commented that at times the plot slows, but I find myself able to forgive these slow areas.  This book is built on both action and intrigue, and I felt that the times of slow action were actually the times of high intrigue.  Herbert planted in many scenes the subtle signs of change, the subtle build up to the final battle on Arrakis that would be 450 pages in the making.  One of the most intriguing elements on the plot was the rather unorthodox use of Yueh in the book.  In this book, we are told the betrayer.  We are told his plans.  We are told again and again that this good doctor would betray the people he served, and yet I was still dismayed and taken aback when it does happen.  Even in this glaring give-away, Herbert plants surprises.  After the fall of the House Atreides, the action slows and the build up begins with glimpses of Paul evolving into Muad'Dib and glimpses of House Harkonnen degenerating even while the Baron's plans evolve as he wishes.  This build up, which many people refer to as slow, takes place over a mere 200 or so pages, less than a blink to anyone familiar with most fantasy literature.<br />This book deserves its place amongst the pantheon of both science fiction and literature as a whole.  No one can deny its worth to literature as whole.  Even if one does not enjoy the book, it stands as a signpost for the generation of writers that followed its publication.  I cannot recommend this book more.  Since reading it, I have now completed the entire series, and I have re-read the book at least once a year, if not more.  Go out and buy this book.  It deserves to be in your library.spice beer, Herbert gives the men soft nuances.

B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Saw this when it came out on the big screen...forgot how incredible it is!  Now lending it out to all my friends...........
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I will admit to being curious about the series due to it recent popularity. The story is engrossing, but I felt like it could have moved at a bit slower pace. The result is that while very likeable, I never really felt like I knew the characters. Overall, still a worthwhile read.
0684857219|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because big arnold wrote it. Anybody else it would get 4. The 4+ stars it earned are for content. Awesome information and pictures and great tips for the newest to us experienced gym rats.  Comes in great use for me making the switch from pure powerlifting to incorporating and starting to get into bodybuilding.  The -1 star it would have gotten with any other author is credited to the idiots at the publisher. When are these guys ever going to learn to STOP USING SHINY PAPER?!?!?! Seriously! I get a headache just looking at it with the glare and reflections. I can only read a few pages at a time before I need to stop and do something else.

0525953728|5.0|This was a good story.  My father and son have read 4stories along these same story lines and would recommend to others
6300276007|5.0|Its a great movie, I watched it many years ago, & just wanted in my collection, I only collected 120 movies, that have to have moral character, sometimes funny, exciting, some kind of story plot,that has a meaningful purpose. But in these modern times, most movies do not meet my expectations. Forgive me, I am old, I cherish the word of God & his principles in the bible. God exists even if you don't believe
0062238868|5.0|I. Ought this book for my father and son.  Both enjoyed the story .  Both have read Boots on the Ground
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|Those who are expecting a traditional,step by step history of movies are missing the point.  Those who are disappointed that they are not getting a slick, actorish narrator are missing the point.  They can satisfy those needs elsewhere.  What Mark Cousins gives us is a heartfelt, layered exploration of what makes film such a wide-ranging, humane art form.  Watching this, I felt that I was sitting with a knowledgeable and very sincere movie fan who can see the \\"wheels within the wheels\\" and wants to share his enthusiasm with us, as we're sitting in a screening room and listening to his commentary.  As an added bonus, the clips look great!  Just relax and join him!

B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie will leave you with a fabulous feeling of an overwhelming zest for life...It reminded me the book of Nikos Kazantzakis Zorba the Greek where Zorbas , just like the main character of Intouchables, is a handsome man, bucolic, honest, bigger than life and full of life, full of this willingness to challenge anything that's worshipped as rational, right, common sense, even boring I would say and substitute it with music, dance, erotism, indulgence, gratefulness, laughter, humour... Must watch! My husband says that this movie is in the league of Forrest Gump and he is right.

B006QNDDHW|5.0|I really love this book, it has a lot of helpful tips to make a good presentation, you can only read the topic that you're interested in, and you will understand, even if you don't read the book from the beginning. It also has a lot of examples.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game easy to play puzzles. Great way to pass the time and keep you mind Sharp. The four Dragon levels are easy to understand and challenging to master
B000OP1M6M|3.0|Seiko has the best name in the business for sub 250 dollar watches so I bought one. The dial looks great but the bracelet feels kind of cheap. Also the automatic mainspring that keeps the watch running does not last that long. So if you don't wear this every day be prepared to have to set the time every time you put it on. I wore it for 2 days straight and it lasted one more day before it stopped. My invictas will run for 2 -3 weeks after 1 day of wear.

B0090SI4LU|5.0|It's been a few years since I've read The Host, but I remember loving it. I definitely liked it a lot better than any of the Twilight books (sorry, I liked them well enough, but am definitely not a Twi-hard) and I was excited when I learned they were making a movie. I just watched the movie recently and now I want to re-read the book. Somehow I feel like I enjoyed the movie even better. The lead actress and the Seeker did an awesome job, as did Melanie's uncle and Ian. I love the romance with Ian especially. I liked it in the books, but it somehow feels even more adorable on screen. I also enjoyed the special effects. That cave was especially amazing and always a little hard to picture in my head while reading the book descriptions. Imagine Dragons' \\"Radioactive\\" is also a perfect fit for the soundtrack. If you liked the book, you'll probably love the movie. If you like romance and sci-Fi-ish stories, you'll probably like the movie, too. It's not a complex movie, but has an intriguing story and great characters.
B00CBLQCO4|4.0|I HAVE GIVEN THIS BOOK A 4 STAR RATING. TO MY MIND, THIS IS VINTAGE LE CARRÉ. I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN PUTTING MY KINDLE DOWN! THE AUTHOR IS A MASTER AT WEAVING A TAUT AND SUSPENSEFUL TALE OUT OF A THIN PLOT. I HAVE BEEN A FAN SINCE \\"THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD\\" AND IT IS NOTICEABLE HOW MUCH MORE BRUTAL HIS CHARACTERS HAVE BECOME OVER THE YEARS, NO DOUBT A REFLECTION OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE TODAY.<br />IN THIS CASE, A GRIPPING READ FROM START TO FINISH.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I read the book before seeing the movie. I had planned to watch the movie with a friend when it was out in theaters, but ended up not being able to. Now I think this was a blessing. I enjoyed the book for the most part (minus the middle, which dragged, and the ending) and I had hoped that maybe the movie would be good, but I hated it. The main character's awful accent grated on my nerves. I am from the South and I have never heard a voice quite as annoying as his. The movie was even slower paced than the book. I did enjoy the actress who played Lena, but besides that, I didn't care for this movie much. The part with the spinning dining table was neat, as were all of Ripley's scenes, but for the most part the movie either agitated me or bored me. I felt the ending was an even bigger cop-out than the book.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Thank you for this inventive game.  I ENJOY the art and game mechanics.  Looking forward to getting some epics ... to keep the inner collector satiated.  Keep up the good work!
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|I honestly wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but I ended up liking it pretty well. It had a nice story and twist to it. My favorite part about this movie is Jennifer Lawerence. I watch many horror movies, and I am often disappointed that so many of the female leads seem helpless. This is not the case in this movie at all. The main lead, Jennifer, kicks BUTT. Yeah, she makes mistakes (honestly, I'm pretty sure we all would slip up) but she fights back so well that I sometimes forgot that I was watching a movie. I really hope that she'll have more lead roles in these types of movies, because it would be great to have stronger female characters in the horror genre.

B000JFDBXO|1.0|I have to admit I was shocked to see that this \\"film\\" was rated so high. It is by FAR the worst of the trilogy and a lot of that is due to the last-minute hiring of Brett Ratner<br />to direct. I wish Brian Singer hadn't wasted his time with SUPERMAN RETURNS...then we could have had a really great super-hero trilogy before IRON MAN  and BATMAN<br />got it right.(ish...the second IRON MAN was okay.) Back to this piece of crap.<br /><br />I remember when this came out..one of my best friends CALLED me..right after he got out and warned me not to go. I DIDN'T LISTEN...<br /><br />*************SPOILERS*******************************************<br /><br />So, there aren't any characters. Cyclops, one of the most beloved X-Men, IS KILLED OFF CAMERA..and then buried..AT THE END OF THE FILM? There's the heavy-handed<br />\\"oh. there's a body waiting for Professor X to pop into later\\" thing. And Magneto might have his powers still? THE WHAT THE HECK WAS THE POINT??? The best cast character was THE BEAST so, of<br />course, he's barely iN the movie. Rogue has constantly been downplayed in the series and this is no different. She kicks BUTT in the comics. In the films she just a milksop...and she's from my home state. meh. The fact that Famke Janssen pretty much stood around in the background until needed. The angel flew across the country to do what again?!! How'd he get there at the EXACT second to save..whoever that was. The took out the coolest character in the series..MYSTIQUE?? lame. LAME. LAME. LAME. The filmwas obviously slapped together with footage from the other two movies. There are so many plot holes in the script that it reads like a haiku. Storm is written and played weakly as ever. and..I'm tired of X-Men being just Wolverine's side-kicks...he's not that cool. Nightcrawler was far more interesting as a character. Kitty Pryde was wasted. This movie was terrible... and I am a huge comics nerd and I get why people would defend it. But, this is a perfect example ofwhat big studios do to great stories JUST to make a profit.<br /><br />SHAME ON YOU MARVEL! I wish I could give negative stars.

The word perdition is by far better than any other. BUT, you have to give it time to learn your typing style for it to be super effective.

B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Just saw this in the theater. To my surprise, I love this Iron Man Series. This one did not disappoint with one exception: Why, why, WHY! does Hollywood Insist! on including their personal political agenda. I was so enjoying the movie until they (whoever they are) decided to include their personal political \\"opinions\\". I left the theater fuming. Come on, enough already!<br /><br />OK, back to this movie; Several good things stood out, including the little boy, the evolution of the suit that opens the door for IM4 in the series, Tony's love for Pepper, the depth of his character really shows..., I really liked the scene where he came out of the hospital and spoke to the press straight up, no political correctness concerns. In other words, he sounded like America, as I remember it - John Wayne style.<br /><br /> This movie had lots of clever twists and turns. One I will watch over and over.
1591845556|5.0|As a learning addict, I was intrigued by this book. I have enjoyed the \\"little professor syndrome\\" most of my life. I enjoy learning and until recently have enjoyed a fair amount of success. Fly Tying, Fly Fishing - check. Motorcycle repair - check. Computer Security - check.<br /><br />When I decided to learn to play guitar I hit a severe roadblock. I have learned a little over the years but I haven't been successful enough to reach my goals. I have sought the one thing that I realized I needed, \\"how\\" to learn guitar. It's easy, go buy a book do what it says and you can play guitar. Sort of. I have faced nearly every obstacle mentioned in the book and now I feel equipped to address and dispose of them.<br /><br />I completely appreciate the fact that the book is light on psychological theory. Learning about neural networks and cognitive theory are much farther down on my \\"to learn\\" list. Real life examples will be a helpful reference point and will help me share with my children so they can also learn how to learn.<br /><br />I like like the writing style and look forward to reading or listening to more work by the author.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />John.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The collection of interviews that make up this book, amount to episodic short stories. The structure and style of the book allows the author to take the reader to far flung locations throughout the globe. This gives the reader an expanded view and understanding of a time and place known as World War Z. You are going to love this book if you love post apocalyptic zombie stories, are mildly interested in the telling of history and if you are willing to accept a more complex multi-faceted examination of the genre.
B00597A6NU|4.0|It's a good flick. The story line is good and the actors are the standard good actors you'd expect. This is one of Billy Zane's earlier works so he's a bit better in this than some of the other B stuff he's been in. I will say I now have a new found respect for some of the guys flying the bomber planes.
1568363850|3.0|I was hoping it could be useful for any travelers to Japan. It's too formal and more geared towards business people.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I have read some other reviews and the don't like it because he is playing different kinds of songs. That is what I like about Clapton he will play what he likes. I think it was Rick Nelson said in garden party, if all I played we're all the old song I would rather drive a truck.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|&#34;Side Effects&#34; is a well-executed thriller that falls under the Hitchcock influence. The twists and turns come with good pacing and the motifs of the noir crime drama, the femme fatal, the stooge, the vamp, the macguffin as a storytelling device, all are in good form. Kudos to Rooney Mara for a performance with very fine nuances in it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love it. I played it on a friends device and couldn't put it down. So when I got my own I had to get it and play it again. It's a great puzzle game and it's so fun you don't realize how much thinking is involved.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Great. Lots of violence Sex and gore Not good for kids or persons that don't like violence sex and blood
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I like it. It's a typical game where you make a city. You build buildings, buy land to expand and complete goals. You can make potions using plants that you grow, deploy leafman to battle, and there are familiar characters from the movie. It can get a bit boring on waiting for things to be built or plants to grow but I usually play another game while I wait and then come back.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so amazing. It's really cool because you get to buy eggs, buildings, and way more. Once you get your monsters to a certain level (or age) you can bread them to get really cool rare or common monsters.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really like it. I bought the whole game after trying the free part. The puzzles are challenging and don't be afraid to use the hint button. It has other puzzles besides hidden object levels and you need to pick up items and us them later as you search around. I haven't finished it yet.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|simple easy to learn game with loads of fun. great mechanics would recommend to a friend A++ great customization. Punch Quest is one of a kind great game
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|You get the free game and after a while it prompts you to buy the whole version. It is a bit pricey for a app game but I might buy the whole version later. The puzzles are challenging and diverse. The story is engaging and you really want to solve the mystery.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I've loved My Chemical Romance since I was eight, and 9 years later I'm a thousand times the fan I was back then. This album is, in one word, flawless. The heavy, almost operatic, songs blend perfectly with the softer ballads, and altogether create the best album I've ever owned by the best band I've ever encountered. I love MCR to bits, and so will anybody who gives them a listen
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's a typical make a city game. You train your troops, deploy them in battle and fight back the in game bad guys (and gals) that are trying to take over your town. You build, expand your land and collect resources. It can become a little one noted however, but I come back after waiting for crops to grow, resources to be found, buildings to be built and troops to be trained.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz have been one of my favorite bands since an early age, and now that I've finally got my hands on one of their albums I can say nothing's changed! They've been here from the beginning, and they'll surely be here til the end
B00D2K40WY|3.0|It's not too bad for a kid's game. I would disable in app purchasing though. It's a good make-up/dress-up game.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|The previews for this movie made me not want to see it at all, but I ended up taking my niece & nephew to it in the theater (both far apart in ages) and they both LOVED it, and I have to admit I did too! Actually everyone in the theater watching it was cracking up, it has a ton of hilarious lines from every character in it. Best part, it was consistently funny throughout, not just in a couple of scenes, with jokes geared for all ages. A very creative story too with the family obviously (The Croods) who are the last surviving cavemen family. Their curious teenage daughter Eep runs into a more humanly \\"evolved\\" guy, actually whose name is Guy who lets her know the world is coming to an end. The Croods are afraid of life where animals hunt you at all times, but when their cave is destroyed in an earthquake, they are forced on a journey with their survival guide, Guy to stay alive. A MUST WATCH ANIMATED MOVIE!!!! Best one I've seen in a long time! The writer/director -Chris Sanders, who made Lilo & Stitch & also How To Train Your Dragon did this one! Hopefully Dreamworks holds on to him for future animated movies, Disney definitely missed out by letting that guy go!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not to shabby and not completely impossible to figure out if you actually use your brain. Spantastically fun fun, thumbs up.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|Irresponsible waste of time and money on a steaming pile of YET ANOTHER flaming Liberal brainwash effort. Does the \\"writer\\" even realize that it is just the reflection of all the pretentious preachy know-it-all garbage taught from K and into eternity?!<br />Teach certain economic and skin-colored masses to \\"be victims\\", demonize white men and capitalist systems, and offer women the power of God. He giveth and He taketh away. Garbage cans of tiny bones and flesh. THAT is what you get.<br />Turn back! (repent)<br />Romans 1:16-32 If you have a care at all, you should be amazed and maybe taken back by the truth.\\"They figured out religion!\\" Rather believe in their SELF than agree to worship God. Doesn't turn out good. Ecclesiastes: \\"Nothing new under the sun\\".
B005MMY9A8|4.0|While it's not QUITE the greatest movie ever made.....there is something about this movie that I like. I think the cast works well together, but perhaps it's Thor (Chris Hemsworth) himself that I enjoyed the most..... and his interplay with Natalie Portman.<br />Worth seeing.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|My fault. I did not read well before I ordered. I was thinking it was going to be the movie. Thanks aneyway. I did order the movie from Amazon later though.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is the best gun simulator on Kindle Fire it is worth it so if I  was you I would get this app
1423113462|5.0|This is the 6th Percy Jackson related book that I've read and I've enjoyed all of them.  I normally read much more complex novels, such as those by Richard Laymon, James Patterson, Elmore Leonard, Michael Crichton....but I found myself without a book one evening, so I grabbed the first Percy Jackson novel left out by one of my sons.  The book was entertaining enough that I ordered the remaining 4 from that series, and have just started this series.<br /><br />They're short, they're easy reads, but they're actually quite interesting and the characters pull you in.  Good stuff!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It's so awesome it has everything I like you should by this game I can't even explain how awesome this game is buy it.
159514188X|5.0|This book was wonderful.  It almost read like a suspense novel and I couldn't put it down.  I had to see what happened next.  This book also makes you realize how much everything you do affects those around you.
0307352153|5.0|It helped me understand its okay to be quiet lol, also how many more people are the same yet successful.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|Bambo is very fun and very addictive. I very much recommend this game. The cartoon graphics are amazing. Hambo is the best way to burn time. I love it.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Great story about personal faith or belief - how big is your God compared to the total size of the Universe?<br />.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|It LAGS sooooooo much FIX it gameloft! It's still fun and FIX the controls I was on a build ing and the control u use to move moved and I died.cuz of the laser z FIX! Also freezes and kick s me out FIX it!!!<br /><br />Add multiplayer to
B00CX1TSSO|3.0|My two teens liked watching this movie; it was somewhat entertaining, but adults may find themselves day-dreaming more than actually paying attention.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. It is a must have game. It may be 6.99 but it is worth it. But they need more items. But still the best game I ever bought
B0012TWRAO|5.0|use it for attaching my iphone 4s to my ninja 300 for gps routing while I'm busy driving. super secure high quality system. Blasting through the north GA mountains and this thing never even budged. Haven't tried it offroading, but street driving is fine....
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app covers it all: current conditions, hour by hour weather for 24 hours, 2 week lookahead and current radar weather map that can be put into motion - all for free!
0385344228|3.0|Well written with great details and well developed characters.  Kept you guessing about the ultimate ending.  Characters stayed consistent thorought.  The \\"murder gene\\" thing was overplayed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Fascinating family dynamics, character developments and beautiful language make it a pleasure to read this book by a superb story-teller.
B000SE0OYA|2.0|I installed this but my Brother printer never really worked right. So I tossed it. (the printer that is) I kinda wish I had not spent on any of these sort of parts for the printer and just invested in a new printer.
B000002KE2|5.0|what else can i say the best heavy rock band ever and some of there best stuff on this one !
B000FCKGPC|3.0|It is really slow.  Martin seems to add more and more descriptions (he is wearing a red velour surcoat from his mothers fourth sister received on the eve of dragon fall blah blah blah) It gets really thick.  Seems like filler.  But I guess he must have to hit X pages.
B000002KIK|5.0|this is a very good rock album but a little different than the old Black Sabbath. Very technical sounding but iommi is still great
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Listened a dozen times through so far. Quality through and through. Just more mellow than previous releases. Outstanding variety between tracks but maintains an overall cohesive feel. No filler. Not a bad track on here. Don't go into this album expecting another SFTD or R. Josh made the right move releasing an album that differs from any previous release. Really a 4.5 for me.
0143120530|4.0|The writing style is wordy and academic, but keep pushing and you can learn some interesting things about how to help yourself and your loved ones and your employees inprove their memory skills, maybe withput them even knowing it. Stop worrying about misplacing your keys. Even the brainiacs do it.
B005C5SJ1U|4.0|Very interesting concept except a little unbelievable. Well acted and moving. The film is well made and worth the watch.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|It's not the same without Andy Whitfield, but the script, the actors, the sets everything is just spectacular. One of my favorite shows ever.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I really liked this movie, I didn't know if I would but I really did like it alot. James Franco did a great job.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Such an addicting game. It can really suck your time away but I really enjoy it. It is much more fun and challenging than the first one.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|The battle's are a little confusing but once you figure it out its okay. Really like the graphics! Hard to put down once you begin
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun to play. It has hard levels but it gives your brain an exercise. I beat this game In one day it was fun but this maker needs to make more levels. I would recommend making seasonal levels or make avatars in the levels talk to you you. I think it would be fun if you have computer avatars helping you along the way.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was looking for a larger bag for my equipment.  This backpack has filled this need.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  There is plenty of room and the spaces are adjustable for the different size items.  This will supply my needs for a long time.  Would recommend this to someone with modest needs.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I am a girl and I LOVE this game so even if you are a girl try this EPIC game!!! this game has good graphics and when the people talk you can hear them talking to you.<br />I sadly did not see the movie yet, but this game is so EPIC now I want to see it! by the way it has 2 downloaded and it takes up a lot of app space. it is still EPIC though!!! and another good part of this game is that it is FREE!!!!!!!!!!! GET THIS EPIC GAME!!!!!!!! DO IT
B004Q9TK98|3.0|I am a lesbian and as a result have read many lesbian fiction books. I was suprised to find a book by Jodi Picoult listed as lesbian fiction but I bought it anyway. Compared to most books, as a lesbian romance it wasnt great. As a court battle regarding embryos it was great. I liked the way the book was told from three points of view though I just have to say every member of the stupid church the husband joins is certifiably insane. And as for the preacher and the husbands lawyer who died and made them God. Zoe is a nice charachter and I loved reading abut her proffesion as music therepist. Vanessa was also great and at times funny and I loved the Megan Fox comment she made about an ex-lesbian. Zoe's ex-husband Max had his own point of view and I still dont see how he bought in to the warped view of his preacher but loved the whole thing going on with his brother and sister-in-law with both brothers in love with the same woman. Zoe and Vanessas lawyer Angela was the main comedy fodder in this book her jokes were hilarious. I loved the ending where it had Sammys thoughts it was nice that the story ended happily ever after quite unlike the only other Picoult book I ever read my sisters keeper. This book is a good resd for a straight person but for lesbians try a book written by one.
0545586178|5.0|officially in love with this story, the characters, the humor even in the depths of their worst nightmares. a beacon of hope for all citizens. katniss is the mocking jay.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I tried this out based on all the hype.  I felt like it lived up to the good buzz and as all the reviews have said it is fun but short.  Once you win there is not much else to do, but to start over.  But then again a movie would be more expensive and over sooner.
193700788X|4.0|This book wasn't the best in the series but it wasn't the worst either. After writing so many in a series I thought she did a pretty good job of tying up loose ends.
B004ELSDZK|1.0|There is absolutely no reason that I should have to be connected to the internet to play a silly puzzle game.  Uninstalled.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just as described. Fast ship. Well pleased. THANKS!!!<br />This is a great TV series.  I have enjoyed this show tremendously and looking forward to next season.
B00AFEX83C|2.0|While watching the movie, we thought perhaps our DVD player was the reason for it skipping. However, all of our other DVDs since then have played just fine. Not happy with what I got. :/
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Just as described. Fast ship. Well pleased. THANKS!!!<br />Very entertaining movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and looking forward to seeing the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story. You feel right in the book and trying to stay alive with Kat. Looking forward to the next book.
0061537969|5.0|I was going through cancer treatment and my friends said I shouldn't read it....but this book was amazing.  Hard to put down.
B00288KNJU|3.0|This is a fantastic and charming movie, with interesting characters, beautiful design, and a great story line.  My daughter and I can watch it over and over again without getting bored.  I toook two stars away for the washed out 3-D option.  The studio obviously never tried on the red green 3-D glasses themselves. They made much of the gray background come through in weird colors, and  the actual areas in color were washed out.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, but don't waste your time on the 3-D option.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season two couldn't stop watching!!!!<br />Finish watching in 3 days, because I really really enjoy it.<br />Can't wait for season 3.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Again, I love the Scarpetta books and already can't wait for the next one to see what happens next for everyone!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Vary  realistic looks and functions. My favorite is the m1 grand. The best part of the app is how realistic shooting is the guns even jam.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|If you love dragons you will love this game. It is so fun to breed the dragons and get totally new breeds. I like that you don't have to purchase anything with real money if you don't want to.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Good action flick.  Great for Prime to have it.  Now I need to watch the other ones in the series.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Really interesting magic system, and a look into the soul of everything! I like Shai almost as much as I adore Vin from Mistborn.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed Gone Girl.  I read this suspenseful page-turner in just a few sittings.  Flynn has the gift of infusing the mundane, every day world with mystery and paranoia, flipping suburbia over to expose it's dark underbelly. I highly recommend this.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|The whole idea of the traveling to different places in space made for such a great show.<br /><br />The way they interacted to the situations that were encountered.  It is better than I remembered.<br /><br />They are all just fantastic.
B00CEJ2ATO|3.0|I must say I was disappointed with the packaging, at least as advertised. The record is most definitely not 180 grams as the sticker in the picture on Amazon indicates, nor was there a voucher for an MP3 inside.  The LP is expensive for only being a single disk, but it is a decent 150 gram pressing if that is any consolation.<br /><br />What's Inside: One 150 gram slab in a cheap, white generic sleeve (something I really hate, and the first thing that will go when I wash the LP with my Spin-Clean); A full color, well-printed lyric sheet. What's Outside: A gatefold with band credits and more artwork inside.<br /><br />The sound: I could not detect much compression in the mix used for the LP format. To be sure, few recording are free of that, but my system really locked into the full spectrum frequency range, and the deep lows of the bass and kick drum. Without hearing the CD, I can already say metal on vinyl is heavier, and more fans of metal should try the experience. The quality of your sound system will affect the tone and results naturally, but the tubes and speakers in my stereo really came to life.<br /><br />Side One: \\"Kingmaker\\" had a good drive and sound, a natural lead out song. I found \\"Super Collider\\" to be cheesy lyrically, but exhibited a good and wide tonal range. Next was \\"Burn!\\", a serious rocker with classic shredding at the start, followed by a mid tempo chugging rhythm and Dave's signature snarl. Song 4, \\"Built for War\\", started as a thrasher with double kicks, and a descending chord structure sounds like an 80s tune, at least until the harmonized chorus. Number 5, \\"Off the Edge\\", has a repetitive, kind of lame line \\"This world's gone crazy...\\". OK, we get it. The song only gets interesting at the bridge into the lead break. Ho hum overall. The last track, \\"Dance in the Rain\\", is a melodic backtrack with spoken word chorus intro, evoking a '1984' Orwellian world (the present of course). The tempo cranks up, and a classic Megadeth jam session follows. Throughout, the vinyl carried all volume swells and frequencies very well. I rate it non-fatiguing with regard to trebles.<br /><br />Side Two: \\"Beginning of Sorrow\\" features an effect enabled bass line that thunders out of the speakers. On this track I appreciated the natural sounding drums, free of that annoying reverb that marred and dated so many 80s albums. Track 2 is my favorite, \\"The Blackest Crow\\". Folksy in the introduction, it quickly becomes a dark metal tune, with the most dynamic twists and shifts of any song up to that point. Number 3 is \\"Forget to Remember\\", which sounds like a typical, overdriven \\"indie\\" tune. Not an essential song for any playlist, that's for sure. Pure filler. Song 4, the last written by Megadeth on the album, is \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\". This is the \\"Dyer's Eve\\" equivalent from Metallica's ...And Justice for All. A slower middle tempo album, with a total thrash ending. yup, this song is the double kick heart reviver, and the fastest song on the whole disk. The last track is the Thin Lizzy cover of \\"Cold Sweat\\". It sounds modernized and heavier than the original.<br /><br />Vinyl? A good choice for metal heads. Hopefully the company will honor the missing voucher when I complain online to them. At almost $30, it is too expensive to not include an MP3 download like the new Sabbath, Queens of the Stone Age, Alice and Chains, latest Rush offering, and others. 3.5 stars for the music and sound, 3 stars for the sense of value with the LP version packaging.ws.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a little predictable, but cute! It was a quick read. It kept my interest enough which isn't an easy thing to do! I would read more from this author.
B009R659L8|4.0|Great read.  I'm usually not a fan of Mary H.C., but she did a wonderful job of catching me from the beginning to the end of this story!  highly recommend
B0081336FO|5.0|I have always loved me some Sherlock Holmes and I think this is a great adaptation from the original stories. Very entertaining!
0425263908|2.0|I just finished reading this book and started on the second one just to get rid of them both. Thought of buying the third and decided against it. I like Ray's writing and the story line is interesting. BUT, and here is the heart of my review, too much explicit sex which I ended up skipping in my effort to find out what Gideon's real problem was. I'm not a prude but too much of something just ruins the effect. I really don't understand the excellent reviews when large portions of the book (s) become repetitive and tedious.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love love love The Walking Dead! I don't like writing reviews of movies or shows because I'm not a spoiler.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game! should get this game if u haven't yet. this game is such a good game to play in your spare time this game is also great for all ages. my friends are  soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo glad that this game has came out and so do I. this game is sort of like temple run but way better! it has great adventures and is super addicting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope all you people will love this game as much as I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|I don't wanna write about the story because that would spoil it for others so just gonna say the first 20-30ish minutes is very slow and confusing at first if seen the trailers and thought it was about something else but then it gets to the part where you seen and wanted to see. It is a good movie and would be amazing if is a true story but I don't think it is but it is an amazing story and it was well worth the price to be a collecter's edition for just $20 bucks!<br /><br />Even for 20bucks it is 3D and for being 3D it doesn't have much jumping out but there are a few things but not long.<br /><br />4stars due to the movie but really the delivery was great got it one day earlier and it was in great condition.
B002R88G5E|3.0|This book is as challenging to the emotions as The Kite Runner, but didn't have the same impact.  Maybe as a male reader I found it harder to connect to the female lead compared to the characters in the previous book.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|When I went to New England I visited some bridges like those of Madison County. The story is  very sensitive and sensous.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|I, too, was disappointed to see that Tom Cruise was cast in the role of Jack Reacher, but I have to admit, the movie was not as bad as I had anticipated.  It was definitely ok!<br />Now to A Wanted Man. I love this character.  The first few pages were setting up a mystery and a problem.  But, boy, this was slow, plodding and never really got into any of the action that has characterized the other Reacher novels that I have read ... all of them!  I am hoping that Lee Child will take a vacation reenergize himself and give us another Reacher novel that we can really have a great time with.  Can't wait!

1400069807|5.0|An Encyclopedia of Jaw-Droppers just scratches the surface. I thought I knew a little about corporate marketing and product design, targeting and all that hoo-haw.<br />The depth and breadth of how processed food went from a convenience to a dangerous addiction really shouldn't be surprising. It's the race to the bottom when competing in a market approaching 100 billion in yearly sales.<br /><br />After the initial read, I tried going through to find a few salient pull quotes, but was soon overwhelmed with that.<br /><br />Just one name: Philip Morris. When they entered the market with Kraft and General Foods buyouts, even they were shocked at how vicious the competition was. But, they soon adjusted and focused on the most vulnerable portion of our society -- again -- children. Of course, the way to get to children is in convincing mothers that they're helping them help their little darlings.<br /><br />Addiction, obesity, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, and a myriad of other health related diseases be damned. By the time you reach ch 14, \\"I Feel So Sorry for the Public\\", you realize that as with everything else; we consumers are the product. Our addictions are a commodity, and there are thousands of products with slick marketing hooks out there pulling us in like Tuna.<br /><br />Although I find it hard to entirely blame corporations. If a demand for broccoli existed, there would be a thriving market for it filled with every possible enticement imaginable. Corporations are easy to blame for our own lack of responsibility. Looking for the easy way out is as human as breathing. Parents on average spend less than 15 minutes a day communicating with their children. Family meals are a thing of the past. Is it any wonder how a highly addictive snack is so desirable? Endorphins did flow and fun was had by all. Panacea in a bag. Once the six can a day hook is set, there's an addicted buyer for life. Hooked on the emotional expectation that brand-x provides, the only maintenance task is to provide maximum comfort at a reasonable price.<br /><br />I too feel sorry for the public.

B003IWYOF4|5.0|A classic movie that is worth watching.  I hadn't ever watched it before until I saw it on TV,  not quite the same, but well worth it on Blu-Ray.

B008RXYOKY|5.0|I just purchased a new Macbook with the thunderbolt input and needed a firewire adapter. It works. I do wish they made a firewire 400 since I had to buy this one and a firewire 400 to 800, but that has nothing to do with this product. It does what it's supposed to do.

B009H7SCMA|5.0|Can't remember the last time I've read a love story like this one. It is unabashedly ribald. Fans of erotica will get their money's worth, for sure. You will never look at a cricket bat the same way again.<br /><br />And Gabriella is such an original character.  She's not like other women in these types of stories.  She's more than a sex symbol, although of course she is still an amazing sex symbol.<br /><br />The language is like literature.  Just like literature.  It was like reading Bronte or Shakespeare, of course if Bronte and Shakespeare had been allowed to write about aroused private parts.<br /><br />The satire of Great Britain is brutal and withering.  The description of the British upper classes, with their petty airs and their casual xenophobia, combined with the hyper-seriousness with which they take the game of cricket, all work to create cast of characters that would be absurd if they weren't also very, very accurate.<br /><br />And the lower classes are not spared, either.  Reading their celebrity magazines, struggling to pay attention to the events of the day (when they can even make it off of the couch!)  It's a biting commentary on how a once-proud empire has become a bored, blasé people.  You'll laugh hysterically just in time to get back to the lusty sex.<br /><br />It all works to make the love story even more surprising.  How can love happen in such an environment?  How is it possible that we are transported into Gabriella's heart as she experiences the initial fear of forbidden desires, the ache of having love lost too soon, and the desperation she feels at trying to get it back?  We're not supposed to be reminded of the great heroines of literature while also reading about heaving bosoms and gyrating pelvises.<br /><br />It's as thrilling as it is scandalous, as impressive as it is salacious.  It's one of a kind and you'll love every minute.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The Bourne Legacy essentially is a continuation of the Bourne Ultimatum, in fact much of the film runs in tandem with the Bourne Ultimatum in that there are references to Bourne being in Manhattan, Pamela Landy's work to implicate<br />Noah Vosen, Ezra Kramer, and Dr. Albert Hirsch in their involvement with Treadstone, Blackbriar, and other operations.  What threw me for a loop was that everything that was established in the Bourne Ultimatum, that is all of the evidence that Bourne (or David Webb, take your pick) and Landy assembled to take down those involved with the program appears to be negated in The Bourne Legacy.  Well, maybe not negated, but we see Noah Vosen slithering through a plethora of words to essentially say &#34;what difference does it make!&#34; in reference to Treadstone, Blackbriar, etc.  The last we see of Pam Landy is her getting into a car, followed by the press, and telling them that if they want any other comments to speak with her lawyer but that she did not have any regrets about the choices/statements she had made.  So, maybe this is the storyteller's way of saying that those behind Treadstone, Blackbriar, etc. will be held accountable.<br /><br />That said, the Bourne Legacy centers around Aaron Cross, who is a member of another program called &#34;Outcome&#34; - essentially Treadstone but this program also uses physical and mental enhancing medications to regiment its operatives.  The events of the Bourne Ultimatum send those running Outcome to scurrying around like rats, feverishly working to scrap all evidence of the program to cover their rear-ends. Of course, their fail to eliminate Aaron Cross and one of the research scientists developing the medications, Dr. Marta Shearing - thus we have our new &#34;Jason and Marie&#34;.  They discover that Aaron has been weened off of the physical medication but the mental medications requires one last treatment, which takes them to Manilia (the capital of the Philippines) in order to obtain the medication.  Once done, it is a mad dash to go dark and avoid those behind Outcome.<br /><br />An intriguing idea, all in all, but the film feels like it is in need of a sequel (or at least an epilogue would have been helpful) to wrap up loose ends, maybe they are leaving that up to the audience.medication.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love using my Kindle as my alarm clock. I dim the brightness when I go to bed, and this app wakes me to soft music, that gets gradually louder if I don't wake up right away. I always hit the snooze, by touching anywhere in the whole middle of the Kindle, and when on snooze, this app gets brighter to help get me out of that groggy stage. I can set how long I want the snooze to be, and I set it for 25 minutes. I can set multiple alarms, and set different alarms for different days of the week. The only thing I wish this app would do is give the real time larger during snooze.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The only reason I did not give this app five stars is because I reserve the fifth star for the paid app.  This a great app.  Whether you want to know whats happening by the hour or by the day.

B008JFUPFI|4.0|Those of you who remember Christopher Reeve's \\"campy\\" Superman films of the 1970's can forget anything you saw in those films.  There is nothing \\"campy\\" in this film and that is ok by me.  The film opens with the birth of Kal-el on Krypton.  His father has hidden Ka-el's birth because he is the first natural birth to happen in a few hundred years.  Like the book Brave New World all babies are born in a laboratory and conditioned to have specific careers.  As Krypton is in its last days Kal-el's parents want him to start Krypton over with \\"free choice\\" on the Earth.<br /><br />General Zod learns what the els have done and comes to steal Kal-el.  He and his forces arrive a minute too late as Lara has sent her son to the heavens in a ship bound for Earth.  Zod kills El and gets ready to intercept Kal-el's ship but he and his forces are caught and are exiled to the Phantom Zone.  Shortly after Krypton self destructs.<br /><br />We see an adult Kal-el on Earth using varous identies and going from place to place (like David Banner in the old Incredible Hulk tv series) each time someone suspects something about him.  He has several flashbacks to growing up under the tutelage of Jonathan Kent who kept telling him that nobody must know of his special abilites because he will be feared.<br /><br />He will later learn of his Krypton birth and will discover an ancient outpost where he can insert a special key that was sent with him in the ship by his Krypton father.  This key activiates the ancient outpost with a holographic image of his father complete with his father's memories.  He will also be provided the costume that we have come ot know.<br /><br />Of course the baddies led by Zod will escape the Phantom Zone and learn where Kal-el is living and come to threaten Earth.  It will be up to Kal-el to make some serious decisions.  Does he defend his Earth identity and the only planet that he knows or should he go with Zod and further his plans for a new Krypton.<br /><br />This movie is filled with a lot of inner turmoil and like Bruce Wayne in the Nolan Dark Knight films, Kal-el must dig deep down and figure out who he is and what he wants to be.  Lois Lane is also in the film and she tries to help Kal-el with solving his identity.  She is on thin ice with her newspaper and her editor (played brilliantly by Larry Fisbourne).  I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish.  Some people complained that the special effects and fight scenes were overdone.  I did not get that but maybe because I only saw the 2D version.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Lois Lane seemed to be able to get to places quickly that maybe she shouldn't have been able to get to.  As weveral people have mentioned, we do so a fuel truck with \\"LexCorp\\" on it so maybe a sequel is in the works with a very familiar Superman foe.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Although everyone I talked to hated the ending, I thought was absolutely true to the characters.  One of the best psychological suspense reads that keeps you guessing until the end.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|There were some good parts but overall the movie was not very good. Glad we not rented it.  Kids liked it though.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|I lived through the 70's, I don't need to read a sensationalized voyeuristic account of it.  Maybe someone needs to grow up!
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|I initially felt sick when i first listened to this album. I gave it a 1 star just to balance out the ridiculous 5 star 'modern classic' reviews, but upon review im gonna give it 3 stars. I've grown to really like 'im in it' and 'Blood on the leaves'(you can't fight those horns in the end') but overall i still feel the album falls short, 'On sight' is an unlistenable mess to me, its distorted to the point of melting speakers and im not feeling the euro club vibe to it. 'I am a God' just goes on for way too long and with lyrics like 'I just talked to jesus, he said what up yeezus' theres just nothing keeping me from skipping the song. I think the problem with this album to me is that it ends when it just starts getting better.<br /><br />The albums not too bad but its just way too flawed to be considered a 5 star classic(especially lyrically)<br />I also know alot of people that have listened to it and none of them think much of it but suprise surprise the internet loves it.
B005LW5J9O|3.0|I kept hoping to get to a detailed explanation of the philosophy espoused in the poem (Epicurianism), but had to wait for 5 chapters before they gave a brief synopsis.  Also didn't explain how this &#34;swerve&#34; changed the world beyond a few general sentences that it did - where is the detailed examples and evidence?  However, the account of 14th & 15th century politics and ancient historical facts was very interesting.
B0041KXOVC|1.0|This reseller is foreign and the format of the movie is not compatible with USA DVD/Blue Ray players. This has no reflection on the movie itself.
B00607EWYC|3.0|This is a nice simple read.  Nothing great.  The thoughts of the main character were rather bizarre and didn't really tie into anything, but maybe that is suppose to be his character.

B00D3V5V7U|3.0|I really enjoyed the new Sabbath album. Although I'm partial to the older material and the drug-fueled production value, Rick Rubin does an awesome job as producer with Ozzy and the boys. The songs are clean and heavy with decent lyrics. Tommy Iommi is awesome as usual. Ozzy's voice is well produced and clear. I would recommend this CD to any Sabbath/Metal fan! Rock on!

B001TW69J4|5.0|I stumbled on to Tosin Abassi browing through Youtube.  He was giving a guitar clinic.  I thought he had a very interesting and unique thumb tapping technique.  I decided to check out some of his music.  To my pleasant surprise it was pretty amazing stuff.  Not only does this guy got his chops down, his writing and approach to music is pure genius.  A guy like this only comes along every decade or so... You will not be disappointed!

B00846REIS|5.0|Great story.. Love Sylvia writing,  dreaming of Gideon Cross...  Will see what the next book bring, reflected in you.. Ready for it.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|formulaic, that is. A lot of fatigued old lines jacked from the previous films, ridiculously unbelievable action sequences and<br />super-people, &#34;action fodder&#34;.<br />Bruce phoned it in and they mailed a check. How well the camera captured the insincerity required to<br />utter the lines of the so-called script. This passes for movie-making like an old man sneakily passes gas,<br />the smell raises eyebrows but at least doesn't singe them. Poo-Poo.<br />Check his drawers.<br />Next one &#34;Die- Hard-a- Rhea&#34;?
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I read the book and thought the movie did an excellent job of re-interpreting a very complex story (no-spoilers here).  It's been on my mind for days now and that to me is the testament of a good piece of literature or film.  Recommend both the book and film probably in that order.

B0001M0A4I|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this record from the man who played keyboard for progressive rock band Genesis, and who many of their fans consider to have been the primary musical genius in the band. Be aware, though, that this is not \\"Genesis with strings\\". From time to time one hears those interesting chords and chord progressions that were a trade mark of Banks' work with Genesis, but it is not like a Genesis album at all, nor even like Banks' solo albums such as \\"A Curious Feeling\\". This is a classical work on a classical label, written for orchestra - Banks himself only plays on  a couple of the tracks. This album is more likely to appeal to someone who loves, say, Beethoven's 6th Symphony (the \\"Pastoral Symphony\\") than to someone who listens to lots of progressive rock but finds most classical music boring.<br /><br />There are seven pieces here (hence the name), and each is enjoyable in its own right. My only grumble is that there is not a lot of variation in style from one to the next. I normally have to consult the booklet to find out which particular track I am hearing at any given moment. A couple of slightly more angry tracks amongst all the serenity and peacefulness would not have gone astray.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I know that I'm late finding this series but...better late than never!!! I hope season 5 will be free by the time I get to it.

1781162646|5.0|Stephen King must have read and taken to heart the scathing (but all too true) reviews of his novels, ever since Book VII (was it?) of the Dark Tower series. You know, the one where he mercilessly killed everyone off, one by bloody one, and enjoyed it hugely. Well, folks (as he would say), it's been that long since I've read a book of his. Thank God, this one is a refreshing change. He doesn't kill off the dog, for one thing  **** SPOILER ALERT****  The bad guy gets it, and doesn't take anybody with him, despite his wily and bizarre efforts to the contrary.<br /><br />It's a real pleasure to read a book that's well-plotted, well-written, and well-edited, with no extraneous or misused commas, writing that draws in the reader and doesn't sicken her, writing that subtly makes the reader aware, at some point, that he or she has come to care about the main character, and what happens to him. It's a simple story, really, if you think growing up, loving and losing, living and dying is simple. It's not much of a horror story. That bothered me not in the slightest. It's the story that matters, not the screams.<br /><br />This is simply a great story. Thank you, Stephen. Even if you felt obliged, quite near the end, to indulge your obsessive anti-Republicanism in your work (which really should be separate, you know). And even if you snapped and snarled at your customer base in your afterword, warning us to \\"save your emails and letters\\". I see not ALL your arrogance has departed.

B008JFUPFI|5.0|If you are a comic book fan or just enjoy summer blockbusters, you should enjoy this movie.  The average movie fan should ignore the negative critics.  Is it a perfect film?  No.  But what these (most critics) negative critics are forgetting is it is a summer movie, not Hamlet.  More importantly, it is Superman, not Batman!<br /><br />It is not too long.  It has a fast enough pace.  It has a story (Remember its not Faulkner, but a comic story).  A compelling story.  The acting is good.  Some performances were very good (Costner, Crowe, Fishburne).  The soundtrack modern, yet moving.<br /><br />Don't worry about Christian overtones or symbolism.  The religious connection was always there with Superman (Jewish and Christian), but it is a movie about the perils and rewards of humanity.  I know that many critics who disliked this film either read too much into the religious elements that are subtly there, or they hate uplifting movies, or for many critics they hate the film because they feel Snyder ruined the Watchman film.  They will deny all of this, but if you search there review histories most of them love movies that are dark, or believe in moral equivocation.  Many of these haters do not like up lifting movies.<br /><br />There is a lot of science fiction elements in the film: the beginning of the film is the destruction of Krypton with a lot of incredible CGI scenes.  There are many flashbacks at the beginning which I loved.  Especially the bus scene and bully scene in front of his dad.  The last half is none stop action with an awesome and long fight that ends with something very very different than any other Superman story.  And lots of Easter eggs throughout the film.<br /><br />This movie is inspiring.  It is uplifting.  It is about taking charge of your own destiny and doing the right thing!  Most  importantly its about hope!  But at the end of the day, it's just an exciting movie about a man who can fly.

0679746323|2.0|Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />According to this book, Mao was completely evil.<br /><br />Although I recognize that Mao did a number of evil things,<br />such a singular conclusion convinces me that this book is a<br />political commentary instead of the history book that<br />I expected.<br /><br />According to this book:<br /><br />  - Everything that Mao was associated with was eveil<br />  - Everyone that cooperated with Mao did so because of:<br />  - They were completely evil or<br />  - They were intimidated by Mao<br /><br />Such a generalization cannot be true.<br /><br />Also, when the book refers to Chiang Kai-Shek, he is portrayed<br />as an astute, capable leader and general. There is absolutely<br />no discussion of the corruption of his administration or<br />the ineffectiveness of his government or military.<br /><br />Much consideration is also given to the influence and<br />spies of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />No mention is made of the agents and representatives of the<br />U.S. that had contact with the Nationalist Government or<br />the Communist forces during WWII.<br /><br />The book is somewhat interesting to read to gain a more<br />detailed look at the history of China from the 1920s onward.<br /><br />However, it is so one-sided that it is a distraction from<br />the historical story.<br /><br />Congrats to the authors on espousing their political views.

I have an advanced degree in an allied health field so consider myself fairly capable of recognizing bad studies and conclusions but this was not the case this book.

The nation is a living hell for most of its citizens, but for those forced to endure life in the many, many camps in this communist nation with no freedom of any kind of expression it is truly heartbreaking.

My Grandson loves it and the movie always brings a smile to his face!  That makes Cars a 5 star in my book.

0385720920|5.0|The main plot of the story Choke is detailed journey about a man facing his demons. The main character Victor, is a sex addict who fakes choking to death to swindle money out of the heroes that save him. The money is to keep his mother alive in a nursing home who is slowly starving to death. The story is almost a collection of stories with the amount of sub-plots that exist in the fictional work.  As the story progress you gain a detailed insight to the character that you feel that you are his personal counselor.<br />As the story opens Victor gives you numerous reasons to hate him, to set the book down, and to never look back. The author gives you so many reasons to hate this man and what he stands for that the reader is drawn to continue. The simple analogy of a car accident on the freeway is similar to reading this book. You know with certainty what you are going to see, but you have to look. It is human nature to put ourselves on a pedestal by comparing ourselves to others who are the dregs of society.  It gives most humans a moral high to read the seedy acts of this individual and say to ourselves \\"I would never do that!\\"<br />The main character was studying to be a doctor, but had to drop out to support his mother. This important fact is brilliantly utilized by the character frequently refereeing to medical terms throughout the story.  When Victor sees a mole on a woman he refers back to \\"see also melanoma, see also cancer\\" This story isn't for the faint of heart as you are drawn into the world of a sex addict.<br />Every dirty detail that most common people discuss as urban myths is dragged out into the open to discuss. From the frequent sex partners he has, to fact he wants to keep his mother alive but not normal, for his own selfish reasons.  Even when propositioned by his mother's doctor with a miracle cure he gives pause out just because he wants to continue being the hero by supporting her.<br />As much as any reader can hate this man, the story sprinkles in reasons to sympathize for him. In one section of the story while visiting his mother in the nursing home, he helps the patients in the hospital. It firsts starts with a patient confusing him with her brother that raped her. He finally pretends to be the brother to give the woman closure in her life so she can move on. This develops into Victor claiming responsibility for numerous crimes and dirty deeds the patients approach him with.<br />The story Choke not only challenges a reader to focus on their own demons but also makes you wonder the motivation of the wrong doings of others. The author's attention to detail draws the reader in and gives depth to the plot. The various twists of the story makes it hard to stop reading, just to find out what is going to happen next to Victor. Will he find his father, will his mother live, will he end up with the doctor, and will he recover. These questions will eat the readers curiosity as the plot unfolds, leaving you with more questions than answers.
B005HED11Y|5.0|As great as you remembered it from childhood. Special effects first rate for the times. Interesting to see seeds of character and plot development seen today in new reboot movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Extremely creative and hard to put down. The author's writing style allows you to really envision characters and events. Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys action and fiction mixed with a minor love story.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app has so much weather information it's crazy. There is so much info that the app is a little confusing at first. These guys are serious about stuffing as much weather info into one app as possible. The 20 widgets are very customizable. Awesome amount of info. Awesome flexibility. Awesome support.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Ok for kids, some nice visuals, but a silly story line and campy acting. Seriously, if you're going to redo a classic then colorful effects just isn't enough.
0439023521|5.0|My best advice to those who haven't yet read the HUNGER GAMES is to buy the trilogy before you start reading.  I absolutely guarantee that once you've finished the first book, you will be scrambling to get your hands on the second and third books as fast as you can.  I have read this book three times and enjoyed it almost as much as the first time.  Not only is the story concept incredible, Suzanne Collins writing skills are what really make these books sing.  And Collins has got Katniss in hot water at every turn, so you can't help but burn through the pages like a hungry kid at the snack bar.  All I can say is I wish there were a way for Suzanne to have kept the HG series going in perpetuity because I'm said to have finished them already.

0439023491|5.0|CATCHING FIRE (Pub. 2009) by Suzanne Collins is the second book in the fantastic Hunger Games trilogy.  This is one of the few sequels ever written that is even better than the first book.<br /><br /> The story opens with Katniss Everdeen, alone in the woods at dawn, enjoying the last of her freedom before embarking on the mandatory victory tour of the twelve districts.  We see her confusion in adjusting to life after winning the Hunger Games, the impact it has on those around her, and there is a big question mark hovering over her life.  When she arrives home to an unexpected visit from President Snow, she quickly realizes although she's won the Games, her future, as well as her families, is now in long-term jeopardy.<br /><br /> The president's veiled threats are ever present in her mind as Katniss begins the victory tour, conscious of the president's caution for the need to not inflame the people of the districts, and to convince them of the validity of the love she professed for Peeta during the Games.  Of course, that all goes wrong in a hurry.<br /><br /> The victory tour ends after several stressful stops, the results of which are clearly leading to hard trouble for Katniss and her family.  Sure enough, the president makes good on his threats when it's announced that to celebrate the quarter-century anniversary of the Games, two victors from each district will be chosen instead of the usual reaping from the children's bowls.  Katniss and Peeta are suddenly back in the Games after only a year's break.  The quarter quell Game is even more deadly because they are up against seasoned adults, all older than they, some of whom have nothing to lose, and all of them turn out to have secrets that will ultimately threaten Katniss' life, and the world as she knows it.<br /><br /> Suzanne Collins is an absolute master at the dystopian thriller novel.  Her imagination and the way she brings the characters and the story to life is unforgettable.  All generations are crazy for these stories as well as the movies.  I traded forum posts with a gal the other day who is in her early 60s, and she and her brother are avid fans of the Hunger Games trilogy.  They've both read the books multiple times, stood in line for hours to attend the movie's premier, and plan to do so for the opening of Catching Fire. Did I mention she's in her 60s?  And Katniss is a 16-year old girl.  Wow, does that speak to the phenomenal skills of the author.<br /><br /> I have to admit, I just can't wait to see how Hollywood handles Catching Fire, and I plan to see it on the day it opens. :)  Collins also wrote the screenplay for Catching Fire, so I have no doubt the second movie will be as great or better than the first one, just like the books.  If you haven't read this trilogy yet, do yourself a favor...get all three books before you start.  I absolutely guarantee you'll be glad you did.  Otherwise you'll end up like me, desperate to start on the next one the moment you've finished the first, and willing to drive to Barnes & Noble at inconvenient times to appease the fix.<br /><br /> This trilogy is absolutely on my Top Five Fave stories ever told, and I have no doubt it will remain on that list for good.  I envy readers who haven't yet discovered this amazing story.  Be sure to read these three books as slowly as you can stand because once you've finished, you'll be looking around wondering how in the world you'll find another story as good as this one.for these stories as well as the movies.

B004USLWVE|3.0|Pro:<br />This bag has a lot of room and packs equipment nicely. In the main compartment, it fits my two zooms (one on camera), two prime and a macro plus external flash and DSLR. There's a little room left over, I suppose one could get creative and fit even more. The top case is separated from bottom by a removable insert, so you could conceivably take it out and have one huge pack, but you'd have to individually pack equipment at the top since there's no velcro on the side to use partitions up there. So I just have it as-is, with a couple point and shoots thrown in, batteries, battery charger, polarizers, lens cleaner, etc. The back sleeve fits my 15\\" MacBookPro and cord. The tripod strap/pocket works just fine with mine ([[ASIN:B00653AKRY Oben AC-1400 4-Section Aluminum Tripod with BA-00 Ball Head]])- snug and secure. The side pockets are small for AA batteries and SD cards- not super helpful, but better than nothing. Rain cover is nice touch. Essentially it's a one stop shop to store my gear and can be used to transport in car or on a flight (would easily fit in overhead- same size as my rollerbag).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Overpriced. I don't know the build quality of the Vivitar, but it looks the exact same as this for 70 bucks. [[ASIN:B00579S07Y Vivitar DKS-25 Photo/SLR/Laptop Sling Backpack - Large (Black)]]<br />Zippers: probably my #1 complaint. These zippers suck. Period. They may hold up if you are careful, but no way no how can you swing this bag around in the 'sling' configuration and zip it open and pull out your camera. At that angle, I just don't see these zippers holding up. Even under \\"careful\\" use, I don't see these zippers holding up forever.<br />Straps: read the other reviews about uncomfortable straps. Especially if you are laden down with gear. The \\"sling\\" side configuration is just a silly gimmick- you want this bag to hold a lot of gear, and with that much gear and these crappy straps, there's no way I could a) carry it slung on the side forany length of time, or b) swing it around front for \\"easy access\\" to my camera in the field. I tried. It's awkward.<br />Backpack: I could stand to wear this to/from a destination. Don't plan on keeping it on your back for any length of time- even mostly empty is uncomfortable at best. Full it's bearable for transport, but just.<br />Strap length: this thing is apparently made for a Sasquatch. Extra strapping just gets in the way. Except for the across the chest strap, which is too short. I think the \\"sling\\" gimmick drove those decisions, unfortunately.<br /><br />So I debated between 2 and 3 stars, and gave it three because it does hold all my gear and the next time I'm traveling with ALL my gear, I'll take it. For around town, I really like my \\"gear on the go\\" messenger bag (small. It carries about 4 of my lenses and 1 camera stuffed, or 3 lenses + camera comfortably, without much room for more).[[ASIN:B00714FF8U Timbuk2 The Snoop Camera Messenger Bag]]
B00B9366VO|5.0|Fascinating look at a music studio, it's history, and all that went into the recording process back in the golden days of rock music.  Great stories about the forming of Fleetwood Mac, recording the first Nirvana record, Tom Petty's early records, etc. etc.<br /><br />I am a musician and was lucky enough to spend some time in many of the famous recording studios in New York in the late 80s through the 90s.  Most of these studios hold a bittersweet tale of their own exciting music history, combined with the advent of modern music no longer requiring real musicians or recording rooms.  There is a whole subculture that was built around these studios that is rapidly becoming extinct.  This is the story of an amazing studio in Los Angeles called Sound City.  I really enjoyed watching it and Dave Grohl did a very nice job.  Inspiring to see his positive spin on trying to keep real music and creativity alive.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I loved this series. So glad to own the CDs so I can watch it when ever I want. The discs were in perfect condition.

B004UNX1LS|5.0|Finally an app that I can watch some of my favorite videos on since there is no YouTube app for kindle at least there is a vevo app to compensate for the lack of YouTube app
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Was easy to move through the game.  Screen sensitive.  Good games within the main game.  Involved storyline.  Major time-waster because once I started playing it, I didn't want to stop, lol.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is awesome and the people who say otherwise haven't given it a chance. I play this game every day and I think that you should get it. The only bad thing is it is a little slow.

Will Smith, Bill &#34;perfect hair&#34; Pullman at their finest...no Oscar's here but fun stuff, &#34;Shops With Fist&#34; as the first lady was a nice touch, and Mr. Quaid as a recovering Nam fighter pilot that makes the ultimate sacrifice...good stuff!  and of course...Roswell/Area 52..some of this is real?... Oi! :)

B0070DQZ86|3.0|It's OK...longtime since we saw it for the first time, just a good low-action, semi-non-violent film with a non-English Robin Hood.
B000OT6V00|3.0|As one not very familiar with comic book heroes, I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, except that it received mostly good reviews, so I watched it.  At first, I thought it was confusing and, honestly, quite adolescent in tone.  Then, after the first half-hour or so, I began to definitely want to see the film through to the end.  However, it wasn't until I listened to the director's (Guillermo del Toro's) commentary that I actually understood what was going on!<br /><br />Mr. del Toro speaks articulately (with Mexican accent), and renders a thorough and intellectually informative, even occasionally amusing commentary, explaining that this version (the Director's cut) is much better than the theatrical cut, adding approximately 16 more minutes to the film.  His jovial, extremely well-spoken commentary is subtitled, making it even more enjoyable!  He explains the genesis of the story, the creation of his script, and describes subtle scene nuances that bring the viewer (me, at least!) much more appreciation for the film, which, after listening to the commentary, will be even better for me on subsequent viewing.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is VERY clear, both visually and audibly, and the subtitles are offered in a multitude of languages!<br /><br />Of the actors, Ron Perlman was perfectly cast in the role of the good \\"monster,\\" but that is one part of the film I had some difficulty getting into, because I never felt his character's appearance at the beginning of the film (in the form of a \\"baby\\" monster) was ever sufficiently fleshed out.  From where did he come?<br /><br />Mr. Perlman is a wonderful, sincere actor, and sometimes I felt he was acting more or less as himself, and just wearing many pounds of red makeup and heavy costuming because it was required for the role.  His rather casual acting manner throughout the film made it feel (to me) as much a comedy as a science fiction-type film.  Jeffrey Tambor, in the role as a CIA agent, lent even more comedic quality to the film, all of which was quite enjoyable.  Mr. Perlman, however, was remarkably and believably romantic with his \\"love interest\\" in the film, which I thought greatly enhanced his character, allowing genuine audience empathy toward him and his situation, and immense audience appeal to see him as a GREAT guy, even as a monster!<br /><br />In the commentary, Mr. Del Toro offered that he believes the sequel (\\"Hellboy II\\")  is even better than \\"Hellboy,\\" but I haven't viewed my Blu-ray copy of that yet.  I'm looking forward to it!ty to the film, all of which was quite enjoyable.

B003XQM2YU|4.0|At least Russell Crowe sounds English here, and it wasn't as sugary as Kevin Costner's Robin.  I like Crowe for the variety of roles he's done and he brought a certain intensity to this...not like Gladiator or Master/Commander, but here, an interesting take on his standing in for a knight.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Excellent movie! loved every minute! Tim Robbins was beautiful like he knew what he was doing! Morgan Freedman should get an Oscar!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It think this is the best angry birds game there is. I somehow cant update Cloud City though. Also, its always me who is angrier than the birds sometimes. Overall, it is a good game.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|i loved this movie when i first saw it and still love it now that i own it. i loved that it came with a digital copy
B001DSNFZA|5.0|I have recently gotten into Jazz and started out with the top artists.  I wasn't sure about Mr. Mingus as he's a noted bassist but it seems he's also a dynamic and modern composer.  I was amazed at what he got the other instruments to do in his ensemble.  Well-conceived and executed original for those wanting to see what Jazz is all about.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Made me wanna renew Amazon Prime. I'm upset they wanted to charge for season 2. So much anticipation oh well.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie is really outstanding.  Funny, poignant, inspiring.  Also, great acting -- kind of amazed by Bradley Cooper's performance and Jennifer Lawrence is great too (in fact the whole movie was really well-cast).<br /><br />Highly recommend it, especially if you are going through a rough time, and the despair/lack of hope is catching up with you. This movie will leave you with newfound optimism.
0765322889|2.0|Product game exactly as described and in good condition so I give the seller 5 stars. The reason why I gave the book 2 stars was do to the lack of character development and the outrageous number of characters in the book. I can see why people would like this book, but I couldn't keep track of all the characters and it ruined the book for me.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|This has the most great songs since Perpendicular.  As I've come to expect since &#34;In Rock&#34;, (yeah, I go back a long time), there's excellent musicianship, clever lyrical &#34;hooks&#34; and fine arrangements.  I've only had this one for about 2 weeks and already have 6 of the cuts &#34;burned&#34; in &#34;brain&#34; and/or &#34;head&#34;.  It's hard to believe just what Glover, Paice, and Gillan  have been able to accomplish through these 4 plus decades.  And, most certainly, the contributions by Steve Morse (now 5 studio albums and 20 years +/-) and Don Airey (fitting right in after the loss of Jon Lord) have kept it fresh with new &#34;classics&#34; for the catalog.  How do they decide what the song list will be for concerts?  In a show, the songs that, in essence, made them famous, are necessary from an historical vantage point, but they could just play songs from the second half of the band's history and still have a great show.  &#34;Now What?!&#34; should be required listening for both aspiring and even seasoned musicians.  It's listenable enough for the &#34;great unwashed&#34; and yet, progressive enough for seasoned musicians to not have &#34;heard it all before&#34;!
B002YCVX5S|1.0|If I had anything to do with the production of this movie, I would be embarrassed to admit it. I kept hoping there would be something that would justify having watched it but that was not to be. Two and a half hours I'll have to chalk up to experience. One star was one too many...
B00338QENI|4.0|I loved this book!  Rebecca Skloot did a fantastic job of providing a history of scientific research as well as a sensitive and balanced look at Henrietta's family and her contribution to biomedicine.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This cd is great. It finds a harmonious blend between violin and dubstep that ends up sounding 100% unique. And this is coming from a guy who hates dubstep. You'll find yourself humming along to the violin choruses and tapping your feet to the beat.  Perfect blend for the wild and refined.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I have all their albums and this one is very good. Gemini, Sick Times, incredible tracks! Boards of Canada transcendence.
B0055MBQOM|4.0|Others have complained about the poor colors or other issues from this calibration device.  I have had no issue.  Installation was initially a bit challenging and so I chose to install the latest firmware from the web (1.0.2 as of this writing).  This seemed to massively simplify the process and was better than the version on the CD.<br /><br />In general, the use is very straightforward with a wizard based approach to initially calibrating your monitor.  After the calibration, the device continues as an ambient light sensor and will alert you if the light changes meaningfully.<br /><br />The only negative is that it does not look like this will work with my TV projector.  My idea was to use this to calibrate the colors for that unit.  However, the way it works is that it creates a custom computer profile for a given display.  This is simple and powerful for displays that are connected to computers (like my desktop monitor), but does not help with displays that are not connected to computers like my home theater projector.  Thus, it appears that it will not be useful in optimizing my projector.  Too bad.  (One star is taken away because this caveat was not explained clearly anywhere.)
B003VR5PPY|3.0|Be warned, this is a mature game, with mature themes, dialogue, and graphics.<br /><br />After finishing the game last week, my overall feeling is one of discomfort.  I look back at the many hours I put into the game, and I feel very dissatisfied with it.<br /><br />It's almost a visual novel (the game is probably about 90% dialogue/story, 10% puzzles). I found the puzzles to be fairly easy...what I found frustrating was no option to skip dialogue easily (light spoiler, there are multiple endings). If you decide to try all the endings, it was super difficult to find the true ending. So you'll have to go through multiple endings, and have to fast forward (for a lack of a better term) through line by line text (which I thought was super monotonous). You'll also have to re-do all of your previously completed puzzles. Again, time consuming and monotonous. I have all the needed codes memorized at this point (argh...those breifcases!)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I found the story compelling and finished all of the endings. But if your wanting something more puzzle focused, this isn't the game for you. I would say though, it's a good alternative for a book. Just make sure you have a good 10 hours to put into this game, and don't be expecting anything light--it's anything but!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty fun, challenging at times, a little easy at first. Hope there are more levels soon. Didn't take long to complete
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I am terrible at this game, but I really enjoy playing it.  Causes time to fly by really quickly when you are bored out of your mind and waiting for somebody or something.  Also, the games (at least for me since I am so terrible) are very short so a 5 minute wait can be quite entertaining.  I gave it one star because the game abruptly stopped working on my kindle.  It is stuck on a coin bag screen and will not exit.  Bummer...I really had fun with it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A not-to-be-missed read for middle school students and teachers, but a great read no matter what age. This would be a terrific read aloud choice for middle school classrooms.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This is a great app that helps you to sleep easier, the only problem is that the cat purring sounds so unnatural. Besides that, it is a great app that helps you to sleep better than before..
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|It's creeping up on a 3/4 of a century since the venerable Wizard of Oz hit the big screen.  In this film outing, Disney has revamped the franchise and created a prequel setting up how the Wizard ended up in Oz.  The movie is a mess.<br /><br />I honestly have not witnessed such poor acting in a big budget film, it is painful.  I can only assume they were coached in some odd way to present that comes across as stiff and unnatural.  Marco and Kunis in particular or just awful.  Mila Kunis gets a little better after her \\"transition\\" but all around poor performances.<br /><br />The film plods around with some dizzying special effects making for nice eye candy.  Typical of every Disney film, there is a ten minute segment which seems like an amusement ride (balloon crash).<br /><br />They plot line is so hacked that it feels like an endless montage of movies that have been done before.  Guy looking to find himself, gets thrust into overwhelming situation - check.  Helpless people waiting for \\"special person\\" to come save their sorry butts - check.  Super evil has overwhelming hordes of troops - check.  Witless hero rallies unlikely army and launches assault into certain doom - check.  Braveheart style troop speech - check and check.  Attack falls into disarray and everyone loses faith - check.  Hero pulls it out and saves day - check.  Refund please.<br /><br />In the end, my worst beef is that the movie just isn't any fun.  It is too dark for youngsters and I think would bore anyone who is over 12.  Not much of an audience left.  The one bright part of the entire movie is the China Town/China Girl.  An endearing moment in an otherwise rancid movie.<br /><br />Hollywood has become the disappointment factory in recent years and I cannot honestly understand why $200 million doesn't buy a decent writer or director.  Every time I see one of these mindless movies which no heart, inspiration or sense of humor.  When I think what someone could do with $200 million to help the planet or give people opportunities....
B00821OX98|5.0|If you like a mix of science fiction where there is action, this is the movie series to watch.  May you enjoy as much as I did.

B00AEFYX4U|5.0|Adlibs were great. Funny all together. Seen it over 5 times. Johnny Depp was great voice over. Recomend to all
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I wish they allowed for 1/2 Stars.. I would give it a 3 1/2. I love the series.. and still find this to be a great book, but just not as good as the first two. I do enjoy the relationship between Gideon and Eva. Reading the journey they are going through is great. The \\"love scenes\\" are still super hot, but there was just so much going on that really distracted me. Between murders, babies, overdose, sex videos, nightmares, exes, you name it.. it is in this book, but nothing settled or solved.<br /><br />I did enjoy the stories, but hate the fact that there will be more to follow and they are no longer \\"reasonably priced\\" so it may be out of my budget to continue.<br /><br />I feel that she needs to narrow the storyline back down to not be so crazy and stick with what made her popular in the first place.. the hot love scenes and \\"alpha\\" Gideon. :)
140053271X|5.0|This is the second Nook ive owned. I was satisfied with the first and even more with the second. (The first didnt break or have any defects.) I love the compact size and the online capability of it. You can use a computer and login using your acount. You can review books, buy or get samples of books, and share books with your friends. The all touch screen makes flipping the page a snap! WOuld buy another any time!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|We Love this game. I play every day. A definite download game for the kindle. Excellent levels and bonuses to win. Better than other bingo games I've played.
9889979942|4.0|Nice book, small in size but great portraits inside. I can only hope someone will make a larger version someday!...
B00C90T4QK|5.0|I DJ for dances here in central Florida and MB has some great dance tunes, especially Foxtrots and occasionally Swing numbers.  Just wish he'd put out an LP with Latin tempos - Rumbas, Boleros, Cha Chas, Mambos, Salsas and Tangos.  I know...dream on!
B00004YA66|5.0|One of my favorite movies. The 2 main actors stand alone and are good enough reasons to buy this film. But the thing I like best about Frequency is the huge life lesson: every decision you make now impacts the future in ways you can never forsee! I've watched this movie a dozen times and I learn something new each time. I'd recommend multiple viewings to piece it all together (it jumps back and forth in time). Great flick!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I don't really want to add any spoilers, but wasn't a fan of how the book ended.  It felt lazy. That is all.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I will admit to being bias where Gaimen is concerned, he is a favorite author but his creativity and well thought out plots makes it completely reasonable.<br /><br />The book takes you on a journey of one man that could be any man. Weaving together myths with possibilities, dreams with facts. You meet characters that you're not sure if they are real or imagined but it takes you on a ride of the unknown and the unexplained.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app does so much more than I expected. It is extremely easy to use and if you want to know just how much time you have left to read/listen to music/play games,etc it very clearly shows you.
B00847KFDS|5.0|In the essence of time, there is only one word needed - Fantastic! If you are a Creedence fan or a Fogerty solo artist fan, you will love this album. No rehashing of old tunes, but rather, new arrangements with a variety of artists, but still true to the originals. Well done, and will likely be a top album of 2013. Made me go back to my CCR archive and listen all over again. Thanks, Mr. Fogerty.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This fine man is a smooth sexy slickly awesome genius with music. Can hardly wait for his next album to come out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was easy but entertaining. Only took a short time to complete. Looking forward to more levels. This would be entertaining for kids and adults.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Reader 101. Beautiful, sweet girl runs from abusive husband.  Has no money.  Lives in little, but quaint cottage, in a small town, where she gets a job as a waitress.  Handsome, successful widower sees her & falls in love.  Husband not giving up looking for her.  Fill in the details yourself.  No real surprises.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I got hooked but it's a little creepy when you start thinking about the line between life and death. Can someone really be at peace when murdered?
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|the movie was good didn't like the black & white beginning, or the small screen. otherwise a good fun family movie
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|We enjoyed the movie.  Visuals were terrific with great photography and editing.  Very good story and the message was inspiring.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is simple and engaging with an eye out for kids. This game would be a good one for teaching logic and problem solving skills. It is a fun game for all ages.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I would recommend this alarm to anyone that has every owned a smart phone that forgets to go off!! I set my alarms (a regular one and a back up) and the dang phone alarm would only work sometimes =(  THIS APP Does what it is suppose to!!!  Thank you!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Loved everything about this book. A quick, addictive read that you'll absolutely love. We have 13 members in a book club that gave no negative reviews.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This product is very well made genuine leather. It is  little bulky however after a few daft I got used to it.<br />I am very happy with this case. The hand strap is great for reading. It is a little pricey though it is worth the money.It fits my kindle fire vs 7&#34; very nice. Everything is protected.<br />Just make sure when you put it in you hear a slight snap you will know it's locked in. Marware is a nice product. I had a marware case for my kindle fire and it was great.<br />If you are looking for well made cases that are a little cheaper I have a roocase origami that I am also happy with.<br />It is very light and nice looking.<br />It is synthetic leather and does not have a hand strap however it has multiple viewing angles.<br />I hope this helps.<br />It sucks trying to buy cases for your kindle fire hd online.....<br />If you don't mind spending the extra money go for the marware. If not the roocase is a great alternative.
B00701L6TQ|5.0|I love this game. It is a great past time activity...... AWESOME. I CAN'T WAIT FOR AN UPGRADE FOR MORE LEVELS........
B00CY1JUW2|1.0|I was disappointed. This album is complex and cohesive but the rock is missing. I am not going to buy another QOTSA album until either Nick comes back or a suitable replacement is found.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Many books start with characters in bad circumstances who escape those places. Sharp Objects looks at what happens when you return.<br /><br />Camille Preaker is a reporter dealing with life after a stay in a psych ward (or the politically correct, \\"mental health inpatient unit\\"). Her alert editor smells a story, a potential serial killer on the loose in a small town, that will boost the paper's prestige. The murders, however, are taking place in Preaker's home town, Wind Gap.<br /><br />Once back there, Preaker struggles to remain the adult she's become since she left and moved to Chicago. She finds herself deferring to her mother and wanting her sister to like her.<br /><br />Like Preaker, I had a childhood filled with troubles - I was sexually abused by two relatives and emotionally abused by another - and while I've resolved those things, whenever I return to visit my family, I find myself acting like a little boy.<br />Flynn's story is gripping. One of the things I love most about crime novels is working out who did it. Flynn outwitted me and I'm grateful. Her writing is sharp and fresh.<br /><br />If you like crime books, then this is a no-brainer must-read.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|My husband loved this movie - the price was great and shipping was quick.  Was a great movie and glad to have it as a part of our collection.
193700788X|4.0|it was a good story, contrary to all of the internet buzz, the ending made since for Sookie, overall I was satisfied with the story.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Amazing movie, this is a gift but I had to watch it too. Came on time or earlier than expected and packaged well.
030726999X|5.0|The heroine, Lizbeth Salander is one of the great characters in modern fiction.  Her story, conveyed in the three novels, is suspenseful and filled with surprises.  I devored the first book, and then began to ration the next two books by forcing myself to stop reading so they would last longer.  I am sorry that so talented an author as Stieg Larsson is dead, but his character, Salander is immortal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app! Great way to pass the time! Sometimes runs a little slow but otherwise no issues!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Many explosions and wrecked vehicles, but no point. Bruce Willis seemed to be sleep walking, showing none of the charm of the previous movies.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This wireless headset has a lot of great features. The 7.1 surround sound is really fantastic for an immersive gaming experience. The mic does a pretty good job of canceling out noise and not picking up too much background sound (and the ability to mute the mic by moving it up is really cool :3) The headset is decently comfortable but is a bit heavy for a headset of its type. The charging cable has a clever dock design that lets you plug the wireless dongle into the USB charging cable, so you won't have to take up 2 USB ports if you're charging the headset while using it.<br />My only complaint about this headset is the overall sound quality. These are *not* audiophile grade drivers. If that's what you're looking for this is not it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I read Catching Fire cube cause I really liked book one of the trilogy.  This book although interesting was not nearly as deep as the first book (Hunger Game).  Still it was a fun read just not as intense.
630218021X|5.0|Reading the reviews of  Russell's movie on Tchaikovski- I think- they do proteth too much- american puritanicals and illiterates like kael or canby- and most of the others- who have not the slightest knowledge of passion in film or music-Did any of the critics like this brilliant movie?<br />Critics are to movies as are pigeons to statues- all they can do is shit.<br />I note the similarities of the cinematography to Tarkov. (the fireworks sequence)<br />When you read detractors to such a wonderful movie as this- I say- if they are still alive- make their lives miserable. Search them out and heckle them!<br />As w the movie abt Beethoven- \\"Immortal Beloved\\"- this movie is up there with the greatest.
B003O86FMW|3.0|There was no ending. No conclusion. No purpose. Just questions...more questions. I despise when a story \\"ends\\" like this. There is no ending.
159463176X|3.0|Khaled Hosseini is such a great story teller but there were too many unfinished stories in this book.  It was so hard to become attached to the characters because I would just start to care and then it was on to a new character.  He probably could have written a few books on these individual stories.  While he is such a great writer, I was not satisfied with this book, most of the stories felt unfinished.  While I realize each had a small connection to the first chapters, the section about Idris, Timur and Roshi was the worst, so sad and finished with so many unanswered questions.  The other irritating chapter was the one with the father that was a war criminal (at least I think so), a lot of unanswered questions in that one too.  Overall, I just can't recommend this book, I am not even going to share it with friends, but I will give it to a used book store or Good Will.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a great movie. You should watch it. Totally worth the watch. Go watch it now. It's great, yay
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzle game, especially for free. Challenging puzzles, nice graphics, what can I say that hasn't already been said. Very nicely done.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|I use this app to keep track of time zones across the planet. While it takes a while to set up, it is extremely flexible.  I have the time zones for all American states and territories, plus numerous other cities. This app makes it easy to add or edit cities.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I actually saw the movie first, which is opposite of my usual \\"read first, movie second\\" theme.  However, the movie was so great, I had to see if it followed the book.  I found them loosely related, but very different.  However, I cannot say that one is better than the other!  The book was very well written with a great plot and character development.  Working in the medical field, I appreciated the accuracy in which the mental illness was portrayed.  I was moved by this book and love the different but similar movie!  Great read...recommend to all!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I am paranoid about protecting my Kindle, and this is good protection against incidental abuse. It also allows the Kindle to stand up, which, while a selling point, is not that important to me.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Good to play while you're stuck some where and need something to pass your time with.  Gets better when upgraded vehicle
B00D7NWTSI|1.0|A great number of people who bought HD tvs in the last couple years bought  TVs that can do 3d, even if 3D wasn't their prime motive in TV selection,  but rather the better overall picture quality, and the fact that often there wasn't a significant price difference,  especially in the last couple years.  If a film was made in 3D, it costs the studio absolutely no more to put it in 3d on a bluray,  or 2d. The cost of the film remains the same,  and the manufacture of the disk is the same process,  the information is all digital in most new movies,  so why is Disney charging such a premium?  It seems to me they are simply trying to keep 3D from selling to most consumers. The disks are dirt cheap to manufacture,  so actual cost is a lie, my only explanation is they don't want 3d to go mainstream,  they don't want the average family on a budget buying 3d, or even considering it.<br /><br />3D is failing for only one reason,  it is priced too high.  If DVD did what 3D is doing when it first came out,  we would all be watching our VCRs still.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This has been a most enjoyable trip to the early 20th century.  Loved the costumes, the actors and the story lines.  Can't wait for season 4.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|This was a gift for my son, who is a movie aficionado.  He thinks that this is one of the best movies that he has seen.
B000001GPX|5.0|Here is Beethoven as expected. Not the best but another good one for my collection of orchestras and directors playing Beethoven
B001N9ESQ4|3.0|This is a good film with a good storyline.  But the scenes are long and plays on an even keel.  Nothing too exciting.  But, the conversations kept my attention.  I give it 3.5.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I was quite impressed with this movie. Animation and graphics were impressive and it was all together very good. Even my two year old son enjoyed it.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is a substitute for TF 2. If you like that game you'll love blitz brigade! This is a fun fps, Get it immediately
B001XV09UG|1.0|It just didn't make a whole lot a sense, I think it was all about showing Nicole's boobs ...I kept watching it hoping for the best but it never came.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|As someone whose family endured The Holocaust, I can tell you that the plight of the North Koreans requires the attention of the world.  This book does a phenomenal job of illustrating how victims of the Kim regime are treated.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I do not do Face Book or Twitter so for me this is useless.  I thought you could still play it alone like the other Angry Bird games.
B000FC12C8|5.0|Great wisdom in a clear language that is easy to understand.<br />If you follow Grahams advice it will save you for future losses when dealing with Mr. Market.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a lot easier to use with this app on my Kindle. I have Pinterest also on my IPhone and I struggle to read some of the captions because the screen is so small. No glitches and I have never had an issue with this app.
B00000J048|4.0|I don't think you  can haven&#34;too many gears&#34; in the classroom!  The kids come up with endless ideas about how to contruct them so everything  spins around.  They really have to use their minds to do this and work together!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Having read most John Green books, I can say that this by far is my favorite. This isn't some predictable, typical teen book; it's quirky and whimsical and you  will become overly attached to the characters and plot. It's, dare I say, close to perfect.
B00A27NN50|5.0|Classic love story (girl meets boy, they fall in love, they break up) but told in a unique way with great humor along with the pathos.
B008VBYN80|1.0|The game is good until you get good then ether you can delete the game or buy stuff. I am saying this then deleting it.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!
0553381695|5.0|Great book. Better quality than the smaller mass paperback.  I was unsure of which cover I would receive when ordering but it was the most recent edition found in stores.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love using this camera. The app Is very easy to use. I love the camera. It could be better burnie haven't found a better one offered for kindle fire HD yet.

B0067RQYNW|5.0|This is a great word document for the kindle fire HD. It works well. It's easy to navigate through its just an awesome easy app to you. I would recommend this to anyone who has a lot of papers.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Watched this movie this weekend expecting to be entertained. On the contrary, the movie drags, and the acting is not that great.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I would absolutely 110percent recommend this  product to anyone who  is looking for a simplest to use editing system.<br />I love this. I use it to edit almost all my pictures.th  edit in  choices are limitless with this<br />App. Worth the download
B000UX6THK|5.0|...I just thought I'd mention that the current DVD release of TWIN PEAKS: The Definitive Gold Box Edition (purchased New in 2013) has a **VERY SNUG** Outer Box - its so snug in fact that it takes a LOT of effort (shaking!) to remove the smaller box!  The Outer Box on the original 2007 release (with the postcard flap) fits much better...!  If you have a choice between the two, I would **definitely** recommend the 2007 release over the 2013 one - the super-snug Outer Box will drive you nuts pretty quickly! :-)
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I totally love and admire  this wonderfully made book. It is awesome because it's nothing like my life. I love it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini is a wonderful writer and storyteller extraordinaire. A true artist, he weaves his complex characters, places and time seamlessly throughout this memorable book.The story, although similar to his past efforts thematically,(And the Mountains Echoed ) is engrossing, intriguing  and ultimately inspiring! An excellent read.Can't wait for the next.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|WAITED AND WAITED TO BE THROWN OFF AGAIN, FORGET THE SILLY PAST, HE LOVES HER, BUT SHE IS JUST A USER WHO WANTS EVERYYHING HER WAY, IF THE NEXT BOOK DOES NOT GET THEM TOGETHER, THATS IT, AND WHY A ANOTHER BOOK TRIOGY MEANS THREE NOT FOUR OR FIVE, COME ON

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Should be required reading before forming an opinion about North Korea.  Well research, though the writing is a bit wooden.
B004J64QSI|5.0|We LOVE Alfie Boe!! We definitely tell all our friends about him all the time!! We did not know about him untill this preformance and fell in love with his voice and talent on the stage!!

B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Good story line with action and room for sequels. Kid safe = no foul language or nudity. I would highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun but too short.  Nice for long car trips. Should have started with highest floor to  escape down and out to somewhere.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My daughter got me hooked..its a fun game...those adds could go away,they are so frequent.  Wondering if there is a twelve step program for me I think Im addicted...haha
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I recently finished reading the Hunger Games series. Matching the movie to what I read was fun and exciting. By reading the book first, it really helped piece the movie together for me. I'm doubtful I would have enjoyed the movie as much had I not read the book, but that's probably because I'm not really into this type of genre generally. The acting was great, and although the plot is rather gruesome, the movie depicted it quite tastefully. I'm looking forward to the next release!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|this is amazing i got mine from ezcorp used it worked fine but the shipping was bad it came late and it turned out i got the older style so i had to plug in my xbox and the personal gaming enviorment wich upseted me a little bit and it is big not as small as it looks but besides that its amazing i would its hd and looks awsome it has spekers,i recomend headphones,and is portable if you want to use it in a car i would get this with it PowerDrive RPPD150 150-Watt DC to AC Power Inverter Strip w/USB Port and 3 Outlet. but over all its amazing
0792839749|5.0|I love this movie and must have watched it at least a hundred time with my toddler. He loves the music and singing and dancing. Plus, the story is fun too!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It has always seemed to me that the first two books were written together and this one was originally the &#34;second&#34; book. It feels very different from the first somehow. Great book, worth the read.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I see why this won so many awards. Fascinating to watch. I did not really know what this was about when we rented it other that &#34;Lincoln&#34; and am sorry I waited so long to view it.
0385522401|3.0|There is no doubt that the author is a brilliant writer, and that it is thrilling to read some phrases, sentences and passages in this book.  However, the story and characters in it are all just depressing, and for me, often very unrealistic as well.  Oddly enough as others have stated it feels much more like a short story than a novel.  In its awkwardness, it feels a bit too long for a short story, and a bit too short for a novel.  I felt that the story in many aspects was formulaic and overly predictable.  The reader knows from about page 1 or 2, what is going to happen at the end.  Reading about the past history of the two main characters, is not compelling enough, to make reading the entire book worthwhile.  Reading about a tragic situation with one parent, just feels like the author trying to wring yet one more Kleenex box out of the reader, to no purpose in this story.  I did read the entire book, and at the end, besides feeling sad and frustrated by yet another romance destroyed by lack of realistic communication, my first thought was about how many hours I had wasted reading it.  I am very tired of reading the same story over and over, great lovers who are reportedly very intelligent - not stupid - reasonably self-aware - and yet they cannot manage to pull together any form of honest communication.  There are some additional things about this book which I am hesitant to write about, as one does not want to give away too much of the plot in a review.  However there is an underlying suggestion of pre-existing father-daughter incest which is never fully explored.  I suppose since the main female character could not communicate about it, the author decided to mirror this by not communicating about it either.  I just found this annoying.  The book takes place in 1962, not 1862 or 1762.  Meh.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Good book with a twist at the end that was interesting.  I enjoyed the way it was written, it kept my interest.
B004SUYMPM|3.0|This book contains 21 rules or \\"great ways\\" to fight procrastination.<br /><br />1, Clarify goals<br />2, Plan in advance<br />3, Apply the 80/20 rule (Pareto)<br />4, Consider the consequences of your actions<br />5, Prioritize<br />6, Focus on key areas<br />7, Forced efficiency<br />8, Prepare in advance (see 2,)<br />9, Focus on key skills (see 6,)<br />10 Leverage your talents<br />11, Identify key constraints<br />12, Take one step at the time (see 5, 6, 7,)<br />13, Put pressure on yourself (see 7,)<br />14, Maximize your powers (physical, recreation, rest)<br />15, Motivate yourself (be positive)<br />16, Eliminate low value activities (see 6,)<br />17, Do the most difficult task first (see 5, 6,)<br />18, Slice and dice (salami and Swiss cheese, see 12, )<br />19, Create large chunks of time (uninterrupted)<br />20, Develop a sense or urgency (see 7, 13,)<br />21, Single handle every task<br /><br />Now, these days you could pick any of these \\"great ways\\" and with enough anecdotes, business stories, \\"scientific proof\\" you could write another book based on just that One Thing. Against all repetitiveness the author deserves credit to point out the same problem from different angles. I still feel that the book is useful as it is simple, clear and sound advice.
0061122416|5.0|Love this book. It is actually a book that I will reread. The story is fabulous and the message is deep! Everyone should read this at some point. I think it'd be a great book for kids to read in high school and dig deep into its meanings in a high school literature class.
B004P8K1WU|5.0|I have done Development work for 20 years, specifically related to jobs and increasing income. So I have read a fair few books on the subject. THIS is the one I recommend to everyone (and I am now applying in my work). It is an excellent read, and a great way to understand some pretty deep and complex issues around development and improving the lives of the poor. Highly, highly, highly recommended. (I'd give it 6 stars if they'd let me...)
006114665X|5.0|This is far and away the best book I have read about the origins of World War I (and World War II, which was but a corollary). It reminds me of \\"Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen\\" by Mark Buchanan -- which is is about how tiny events have the potential to end up causing unimaginable catastrophes, natural or otherwise. The book is required (and oh, so depressing) reading at a time when minor and mostly artificial countries such as Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan and now Syria are able to drag Powers into disproportionate military actions, causing them to over-ride sound judgement about elementary self-interest. I found the portray of Viscount Edward Grey - he of \\"The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our time\\" particularly interesting. Had he not been so uninterested in European affairs - focused rather on the British Empire's global reach - and bought Eyre Crowe's ill-grounded anti-Germanism, the 20 th century and ours might have been very different. I also was fascinated by the (unfounded) belief in Russia's tremendous economic and military progress - a prequel to the (non-existent) post-Sputnik \\"missile gap\\".
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love this show and keep buying series after series. Keep up the great work Chuck Lorre! YAY Big bang Theory!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much.  I could not put it down.  The story was told so well.  I felt like I was right there going back in time.  When the were in Williamsburg, I could relate to the town as we have visited there several times.
0425252868|5.0|If you like to read about WWII , this book is for you. I found the German soldier in the story very interesting to get his perspective of the war and his thoughts. The author has done a fantastic job of telling the story of these two men. It goes in detail about the life's of these two men and how their paths cross in WWII.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game... luv playing solitaire :) need more free games please!! more angry birds too please!!  lower prices too would be nice too!!!  :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had barely put this down when I bought the next book. Compelling storyline, and very &#34;real&#34; characters. Makes you think about how we all would react when put under tremendous stress. An excellent read.
B000008JUM|2.0|This CD is not what I expected.  I should have read some of the earlier reviews with which I totally agree.  If you appreciate the true essence of Cole Porter, these renditions of his classics are a disgraceful distortion.  The cause for which the CD was created, of course, was a worthy one.
B000V39KDO|5.0|The actors are hot, the story is great, and I love the battle scenes! Definitely on my list of classics!
0385535147|3.0|One day last week I had lunch from McDonald's, something I don't often do. I had a quarter pounder with cheese, fries and a chocolate shake. It was all tasty. But when I got back to work I felt bloated and sluggish for the rest of the day and told myself that I won't be doing that again for a while.<br /><br />The way I felt that afternoon is very similar to the way I feel right now after blazing through this tasty, cheezy Grisham book in the last 3 days. And I tell myself the same thing - I ought to know better.<br /><br />The Racketeer was highly enjoyable for the first portion of the book, maybe a third of the way through. Things were fairly logical and believable, at least for the Grisham universe. I felt like he had got his talent back and was writing as well as many of his early novels. Perhaps I have been judging John too harshly for the last decade or more. Then things kicked into overdrive with the ridiculousness. I was forced to suspend any sense of logic or believability. The narrator and main character is a complete mastermind who can plot events many moves in advance, manipulating governments and criminals with equal precision.<br /><br />If I was stupider or perhaps drunk I could have even enjoyed this novel more. I don't begrudge JG his popularity or his vast wealth and I'm not just criticizing this novel(along with about all of his recent work) just because he is popular. Stephen King is huge and still manages to write 5-star books more often than not.<br /><br />But this stuff is bad for you intellectually. Sure it's fun, but we could do much better. Easily.<br /><br />If Grisham published a book every month I would probably just give up on him entirely. But since he only puts out something every year or so there is a good chance that I will come back next year for another mindless artery-clogging portion. And probably feel exactly the same way I do now.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|This is a great movie! It is very well documented and you learn a lot about chimpanzee's in this film. it is educational yet a fun movie to watch. As is the case in nature, it isn't always the outcome you want, yet it is a good film to watch for kids of any age:) The music is nice too!
0425263924|5.0|This book was so great that I read it in less than two days. I was waiting patiently for its release. I read the first two books &#34; Bared to you and Reflected in you and I fell head over heels in love with the characters, the storyline and the writer of this book. There's a lot of people in this country and the world that are like Eva and Gideon, that have experienced horrifying and violent things happen to them in life but unlike them we're not rich, so most of us can't afford to get the help we need. This book helps people like us and the other people that have never experienced any traffic stuff in life, I think it helps them to understand people like us better. I loved the series and I an waiting with anxious anticipation for the follow up book, which will be book four. Please don't let us wait too long and I really hope that they are still together at the end of it all.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|There is nothing pretentious about this book, despite the fact that it is about the Queen. Fantastic characters, people that you feel like you might actually meet. Highly recommended.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|I love Richard Thompson and this is one of his best CDs ever! You should totally buy this record! You will not be disappointed.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I use plex everyday and it works well. I have it on all my devices and recommend it to my friends. Love it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this was a great game but way to short. cant wait till the get more levels. I breezed right through these . lkeeps you thinking..
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|It really is.  I was a huge fan of the first few books but like all series, the plot grew thinner until this book.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The sound like the old times. I loved it, great drums. I wish they were younger and produce a new album.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As Harry gets older, he uses his past experience to uncover crimes.  Harry Bosch is a great<br />anti-authority cop willing to bend the rules to smoke out the guilty.  Great read!
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|This was an okay movie that should have been much better with the star-power that it had.  It was entertaining on instant video but we would have been really disappointed if we had paid the big bucks to see it at a theater.
B001NESPHC|3.0|I love her voice but I got tired of this CD pretty fast.  I think because all the songs seem so similar.  She has a beautiful husky voice and love few of the songs on this CD including Our Love is Easy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Spent lots of time playing because it is really fun and runs great on the kindle fire. NICE APP get it for sure
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Every song on this Cd is simply devine!  Well written music is rare these days!  Her words are so pure and relevant!  Thank you for such a great CD!
B0093F3Q4K|4.0|It is a good performance, maybe not the best I think there was a need of more energy and power.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Lots of fun to watch your city grow! However, frequent requests to earn invest points by posting accomplishments on Facebook are annoying.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|After copying 9 slides the scanner no longer recognized the SD card. After trying several different cards with no success I returned the scanner.  Some difficulty getting plastic slide mounts into the scanner.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|I'll be the first to admit, I probably like BTR (Big Time Rush) more than the average 20-something male should. But there is something in BTR that you just don't see in music today. First off, I have always admired the energy in BTR albums. BTR music makes you want to get up and dance along and their newest album 24/Seven is no expection. The album is energetic and uplifting as seen on previous BTR albums \\"Elevate\\" and \\"BTR\\". The album also includes a couple of heart warming ballads to finish the CD. 24/Seven is also the group's most mature album to date. It is amazing how BTR managed to give the album a much more mature feel and yet still be fun and energetic. Whether you a fan of BTR or not, I recommend getting the deluxe version of the album as it includes 5 additional tracks which are absolutely stellar.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: 24/Seven, Like Nobody's Around, Get Up, Confetti Falling, Na Na Na (Deluxe Verison Only)<br /><br />In summation, 24/Seven is the band's best album yet and fans won't be dissappointed. If you never listen to BTR before (*gasp*) this album would be an excellent additional to anyone's music collection especially if they are a fan of pop.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Another puzzling game to keep me busy.  I am one of those people who watch TV and do puzzles at the same time...perfect!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This movie is junk from beginning to end. What there is of dialogue is so bad that one of the best things about the movie is that there is so little of it. This movie is an insult to serious movie goers. Garbage is an aptly fitting adjective. If Bruce Willis doesn't donate his entire check to charity he should be ashamed of himself; but he should be anyway for appearing in this celluloid piece of trash. Viewing it causes you to feel dirty, as if you were associating with lowlifes. Avoid this movie as if it were dog feces on the sidewalk.
034554398X|5.0|This was my favorite out of the first three books.<br /><br />Fiction: Believable vs. Fantasy<br />The first book kept the plot fairly realistic (knights and war), the second book introduced some magical creatures (dragons and ice creatures), but the third book went full-on fantasy (resurrection, ghosts, giants, dragons).<br /><br />Suspense:<br />Without giving anything away, this book really keeps you on your toes. Where the first two books leave many major characters \\"hostage\\" to some other faction, this book is an absolute bloodbath. Compared to the first book, 2x as many major/semi-major characters are killed, which allows the story to focus on different factions, while still incorporating the original factions (Stark/Lannister) in the main storyline.<br /><br />Only minutes after finishing the 3rd book, I ordered the 4th - can't wait to see what happens next!
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Excellent CD.  The lyrics on his songs just touch my heart.  This man belongs in country music for a long time.  Can't say enough about it.  I have been telling all my friends to purchase a copy.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|The game was fun, and can be addictive,but...the number of issues I found forced me to reduce the number of stars to the same level of enjoyment the game provides since the last upgrade about a week or so ago.  First, the issues were limited to the fact that there's a cap on energy of 50 and I have to collect and feed a minimum of 100 businesses,trees, homes, plants,and or animals to keep up with the repairs and injuries required when disasters hit which are far too often than possible to keep up with out needing to buy more which I refuse to do when the level of playtime versus requests or requirements to spend more to play is so unfairly balanced. Also,I am someone who prefers to not be\\"forced\\" to play with strangers or be a pest to my friends and family by inviting them in order to not have to spend more money. I blocked myself from all these applications so that I no longer had to clean out hundreds of invites which becomes a neusence.  I don't mind spending a fair price for an online game and to upgrade if I like it,but I don't like being forced to pay to to keep playing only to have trickery like disasters take it away away to get me to use more coins and energy in a relentless attempt to get me to make that purchase for more energy to save animal's that I spent $ on because a quest required me to purchase it.  Another issue: When you go to the mine and hit a prospecting reward of 50 energy, that is the worse reward of all. Remember the energy cap?  We'll,you guessed it. Any energy you win will only be the difference between the cap and what you had when you went there,so the only time the 50 energy is worth winning is if you're on empty.  So,if you spent 20 hearts or even if you won the energy on the $5 field like I did....twice!  Then you waste your money, like I did...twice,(both were back to back visits to the field and didn't realize the energy wasn't rewarded until I left). The plots are another issue where they stick you.  You buy a plot,and you can't get full use of it. Many obstacles,(trees,weeds,shrubs,rocks,etc), are unremoveable if any part of the pixel base so much as touches the borderline of the adjacent lot.  They do not allow you the privileges of the the full full lot purchase. You can only remove stuff in the middle and a lot of space goes to waste until you're able to expand again and then  you have to wait another two days,(displays 1day but is deceiving because when you hover over the pending lot, it reads more like 30 or 47 hrs depending on your level), and spend another $40k plus.  These are issues that take the fun out of what could be a great game.  Btw, I was reimbursed for being cheated out of the 100 energy I should've received.  They should have ability to store energy you win and maybe even object from your land... especially if they are going to make you pay $ for some items to complete quests.  Latest mistake added...crops withering before you get back!  Then your smacked in the face with it by offering to let you pay $1 to save them or forget it. Yes, forget it if you don't want to waste $,and don't mind replanting all those crops again or take the chance of tornadoes, stampede, flood, or fire, taking them out again.  If lucky, when fully sprouted, you can get them all pulled in one round of 50 energy energy before having to wait for more energy....Oh, wait... what about those sick folks,and animals and the other stuff to collect before your town gets unhappy and profits fall because you can't keep the businesses running without the food,or get enough wood to make the remedies because you keep running out of energy....what to do...what to do! Seriously,I won't buy all the energy it would take to keep up...this game not fairly balanced.  It reminds me of a midway game at a roving carnival. It's fixed to make you spend more $$ than you can possibly get back in fun.<br /><br />Ok folks, my last update was placed in comment to this review below,(sorry about that,didn't see the edit comment option until now).  Anyhow, good news bad news,depending on your perspective.  The comp I was provided to recover the 63 level progress got me to about level 38, but it turned out to be worthwhile since I was able to speed up alot of actions to regain the lost land, and try for prospecting that helped regain some if not most of the items that otherwise can't be purchased.  This caused me to deplete all the compensation before reaching my previous level,however it allowed me to make sure the town was to my liking and worthwhile moving on the rest of the levels at regular pace.  Now,as for the bad news.  The problem that got me in the situation where I lost all progress still exists.  The delima is only if you lost progress at no fault of gameloft.  This is a VERY real possibility and GameLofts FAQ even states that all progress is stored on your device and not in the cloud or on their server or in any way possible to recover recover if device is replaced, or if game is reinstalled,(not upgraded,reinstalled).  My issue is that they will have times of upgrades and at anytime, an upgrade could result in an accidental wipe out of all progress as it did with me.  Since gameloft has no technical ability to reserve or help conserve game progress,I feel they have no right to charge anything for ingame playing since they cannot determine what and how much was lost.  Amazon recently discovered a defect in my device and will need to send me a replacement which will arrive in two days.  I was actually pretty pleased with GameLofts customer service and their willingness to make good for my loss a few weeks ago that I started spending real money to purchase more stuff that required game cash and yes,while the ratio of cash in game is not equal to what the quests and farming/hunting or tree cutting can return, the addiction of the game still had pull and made me want to strive for a really nice town. So the issue is that all that comp and all the extra money spent to reach what is now level 52, is all for naught. I will now lose all that time and added money put back into the game. EA,(Entertainment Arts),has the ability to store all progress and allows for transfer, (Sims freeplay), and this is an app just like all others.  Not sure why gameloft can't do the same. To me, that is a risk factor that I no longer intend to trust.  For that reason I am not able to increase the rating.  I am not decreasing it because customer support is good.ption until now).

B004A8EI9M|1.0|I just can't understand all the hype regarding this show. There were too many deja vu -moments of the Falling Skies that I watched a few months ago: Empty world, civilization almost wiped out, stupid people. If you want to see zombies shot or hacked to pieces, there is a plenty of that... Even that wasn't my issue with the show, but the lack of interesting elements. Acting was ok, but it doesn't help much if the story is lacking. I have enjoyed several shows in the past, like Prison Break, SG-1, SG Atlantis, BSG and especially Babylon 5. Even though some of those were not necessarily perfect shows, never once did I have the urge to stop watching them like happened with every episode of the Walking Dead Season 1 (and Falling Skies Seasons 1&2).
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|The whole #1 ladies detective series is good, plain fun.  Alex McCall has a good thing going.  Enjoy with a cup of tea.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|i love this story and the music.....  It would have been so much better if the actors in the lead roles could actually sing well!
B00BHMF578|5.0|A bit of history that occurred when I was a child.  I really had no idea what started the unrest in Iran and the hostage situation.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We can't put the game down. My son and I fight over whose turn it is and how long each can play!
B00821OX98|5.0|Once I started watching I couldn't stop. I love this take on the classic \\"aliens trying to conquer the world\\" tale. Noah Wyle (from ER) carries the lead role well. Supporting cast is also good.<br /><br />If you don't get hooked by episode 3, we are not friends :)
0440237688|5.0|Excellent, thanks.
B000SE5BLG|5.0|Come on, if you are reading this review, then you don't know Black Sabbath.  I say, now is the time to push that button because this is a great introduction to the 1060s/70s and the rock sound that blasted a nation.  Hey, they just put out another album..they are rock strong!
0756404738|5.0|This am really enjoying this series.  Both The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear have me engrossed in the story.  When others see I'm reading this book (usually at lunch time) they will ask me about it and say that they've read it too and love it.  Hope we don't have to wait too long for the third book.  As far as I'm concerned, I wish he would not stop at a trilogy.  Wonderful detail and so believable . . .

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another fascinating novel by Hosseini! He continues to educate us about his country in a most entertaining way. Read it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|reminds me of 100 floors but with a little more hidden object game type overall fun &amp; will look forward to new levels
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. It has great graphics and it's a really fun time. My only issue is updates. I have this game on my kindle fire and my smart phone. The updates to my kindle take weeks longer then my smart phone. If we could get updates quicker I would give five stars.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|you really need your thinking cap for some of these games, but it was lots of fun. and not like ur ordinary puzzle game. I enjoyed it.
1400052181|5.0|I taught this novel in a 10th grade Lit class for a summer program. I was pretty shocked to see how every student was raving over this book; yet it is quite the masterpiece.<br /><br />There are many great things to say about this impressive work of creative non-fiction. For starters, it was a treat to be educated about the cancerous Hela cells taken from the cervical cancer patient, Henrieta Lacks, in the 1950's. The author sheds light on the medical practices of the era, before many of the government regulations and restrictions we have today. At the same time, this book is a study of race relations and the treatment of African Americans by practitioners in the medical field. The author places this story in the context of the Tuskegee Syphilis experiments, which had been occurring prior to George Otto Gey culturing the cancerous cells from Lacks' cervix, apparently without her consent.<br /><br />Alongside a history lesson, the reader gets a healthy dose of information on the science of cell cultures. Miraculously, the cells cultured by Gey began to replicate--and then never stopped. In fact, her cells are still living and multiplying today. They've been used in numerous experiments, including an expedition into space, and have had several uses. The conflict, though, centers around the question of whether the Lacks' family should be compensated after millions of dollars and more in profits have been generated by Henrietta's cells, especially given the reality of their past and present economic hardships.<br /><br />Perhaps most impressive about this book is how the author blends historical and scientific fact with the story of the woman behind the cells. Setting out to write a book about Lacks, she looks up the family and introduces herself. She meets Henrietta's daughter, and the two soon become friends, setting the stage for Skloot to write what I'd venture to say is her landmark literary performance. An absolute \\"must read.\\"
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I'm an old pinball player....I'm not disappointed at all with this &quot;video pinball game&quot; close to the real thing. Great on my kindle fire hd 8.9 I'm hearing impaired...so I can't tell you about the sound effects. I'm sure having a blast! Lol...try it. Have fun..
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|absolutely LOVE this game.<br />it gets more and more challenging and brain teasing as you get farther in the game , and it's a GREAT time-passer !<br />FLAWLESS on my Kindle Fire HD and worth the .99 cents !<br />now bye , im gonna go play this now ! :)
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Undoubtedly \\"Man of Steel\\" is the best movie of super heroes produced until today. The story is very familar and the action scenes are the best made ever. Is incredíble see Superman as a man who can make smart decisions, without neglecting the emotions that make it more human than anyone around him. The casting is also spectacular, from Russell Crowe to the same Clark Kent / Superman makes the most awesome history of Superman until today.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I loved this film, again without having read the novel. The actors did a really great job. There are glimpses of Chinese culture, American culture and Chine American culture. You get to know so many different personalities and their own understanding of identity. Very moving!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is so fun! I love how you get to battle too. It's not just another one of those games. It's worth it.
B00471TLZS|5.0|a very good movie.  It had amazing special effects when it was new and they are still good today.  My kids were scared to go to sleep.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I love the feel of the watch it is very solid feeling not cheap plastic like some watches I have owned .
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Story layer upon story layer leaves the reader traveling down a winding race track of a novel. King Lear overtones but gothic  in detail makes an interesting mix. It's hard to put down! I stayed up until 3 a.m.one night to finish it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so amazing. I completed it in 2 days because id been playing it nonstop. I urge you to buy it
B00AFEY354|5.0|Before watching this film, I haven't read the novel. With nothing to compare it to, I was really convinced by this film. It helps people understand the inner workings of community at school, symptoms of bullying, homosexuality, anything you cannot perceive any more because you're not a teenager any more. The main characters aren't flat, but rather complex and very likeable. Good job!
0345803493|4.0|It was a bit on the wild side.  Some of the thngs he wanted of her was a bit much for me.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly again brings the reader into the world of Harry Bosch and the empathy he brings to the victims for whom he seeks justice. A fast read with twists and turns, a typical Bosch case where nothing is what it seems to be and only Harry can tie the threads together while battling political and personal issues.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I finished,an  immediately started rereading. Cline is as masterful as the artists he pays homage to in his novel, I only hope he finishes another soon.

B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Angry Birds is my all time favorite, addicting game. It keeps me on my toes! Sometimes I get angry when I lose a level because I was so close to winning the level. It is a great way to pass your time, however, don't forget you have other things to do!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Fast Paced, And Lots Of Fun. My Grandson Loves Temple Run Oz, Now He Has His Grandparents Involved. Great Game.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I really wanted to love this book  as much as the previous two. Hosseini still remains a master at  character development. What did change in this novel was the flow.Each chapter was told from a different character's point of view. When taken individually, the chapters were well- written, but the approach  made the overall  plot line disjointed. Unfortunately, timing IS really everything , and this book didn't deliver because of it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart, funny, quality production, cast & writing.  Even the &#34;bad guys&#34; are funny and oddly likable.  Highly recommend watching it.
0345803507|4.0|It was crazy, I really don't think It do half the things he wanted her to do.  Some seemed a little on the dangerous side but I guess that's what it was all about.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|Not as compelling a story as the first three books, but still well worth the read.  Great for kids; educational, with good lessons.  Grisham has really created a charming character in Theo.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Lyrically unique and musically complex, yet simple at the very same time. Kanye is a modern day Miles Davis in that he doesn't care for genres or labels on his music and he is an innovator. He sets his own trends. In a few years this album will be the grounds for what we call \\"rap\\" but by then Ye will be on to the next project. He is a musical genius and hopefully someday more people will come to recognize this but until then this is a great album and anyone looking for something they never heard before will respect the uniqueness of this album.
B00CHILW64|4.0|A gripping drama of a family trying to piece itself back together after being torn apart by a tremendous natural phenomenon.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|\\"Man Of Steel\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A young boy learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth.

But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind.<br /><br />The cast led by Henry Cavill (as Clark Kent / Kal-El / Superman), Amy Adams (as Lois Lane), Michael Shannon (as General Zod), Kevin Costner (as Jonathan Kent), Diane Lane (as Martha Kent), Laurence Fishburne (as Perry White) & Russell Crowe (as Jor-El) is excellent. The directing by Zack Snyder is excellent. The story (based on the comic books created by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster) by David S. Goyer (also did the screenplay) & Christopher Nolan (who also produced), the screenplay by Goyer is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Hans Zimmer is excellent. The cinematography by Amir Mokri is excellent. The film editing by David Brenner is excellent. The casting by Kristy Carlson & Lora Kennedy is excellent. The production design by Alex McDowell is excellent. The art direction by Chris Farmer & Kim Sinclair is excellent. The set decoration by Anne Kuljian, set dressings by Paul Allen, Danial A. Miller Jr., Guy Roland, David Soukup & Patrick Kearns, set designs by Stevo Bedford, Mike Barton, Aric Cheng, David Clarke, Scott Herbertson, David W. Krummel, Tammy S. Lee, Thomas Machan, David Moreau, Sarah Nolan, Margot Ready, Kerry Sanders & Bryan Sutton is excellent. The costume design by James Acheson & Michael Wilkinson is excellent. The special effects supervised by Allen Hall & Scott Kodrik, coordinated by Joel Whist & John D. Milinac is excellent. The visual effects supervised by David Wallace Allen, John 'D.J.' Des Jardin, Joe Letteri, Keith Miller, Guillaume Rocheron, Chad Wiebe & Ged Wright, coordinated by Valdone Cerniute, Ana Marie Cruz, Isabelle Fleck, Jack George, Sofus Graae, James Greig, Rachel Faith Hanson, Danny Huerta, Ashley Irving-Scott, Zafar Janjua, Woojo Jeon, Abigail Mendoza, Sarah Middleton, Sara Moore, Marlene Nehls, Max Rees & Rebecca Scott is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Damon Caro & fights coordinated by Ryan Watson is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent and well-done, well-made reboot of the Superman saga that is entertaining and impressive. This is also an impressive film, visually and thematically. Zack Snyder has directed an excellent film, which is possibly his best film of his career, thus far. Christopher Nolan has also done an excellent job in helping revive the Superman saga. Henry Cavill is an excellent Superman / Clark Kent / Kal-El & Amy Adams is an excellent Lois Lane, with an excellent cast backing them up. This is one of the best movies of the summer season and of the year.
1594744769|4.0|Funny and interesting. Some of the pictures are creepy. But it was a fun story. Good for when you need a break from heavier subjects.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I kept reading thinking something exciting was going to happen...deep dark secrets revealed...some kind of suspense...just lots of sex and competition on who loves the other more..Giddeon wins that battle hands down...come on Sylvia we all know that married sex looses it steam at some point that's why these series end with happily ever after...where could you possibly take these two next?
B00005B6C9|4.0|This CD was worth the money. The first 5 songs on the album are done live on their DVD Bee Gees Live by Request. There are 12 cuts on the album for which I don't care for the last 2 which I skip when listening to the CD. Still a good buy for the Bee Gees fan.
B008393Q2O|5.0|I've been very pleased with this software. I got it as the FAOTD, but would gladly pay the $2 for the product.<br /><br />SkinnyNote has the ability to create checklists (I use mine for short grocery lists and to-do lists), text notes, and also draw notes. Since I do not have a stylus, the draw notes look a bit ragged on my screen, but are still legible.<br /><br />There are NO ads, NO annoying messages asking you to purchase anything else, and the interface is clean, simple, and easy to use.<br /><br />Once you have created notes, you can search and sort through them, and can also set reminders to notify you if you want.<br /><br />Excellent clean product, pleased to recommend.

B00AW57L96|5.0|Liane Moriarty has crafted a superb novel with sympathetic characters. This author has an enviable knack of getting into the minds and hearts of women - well, she is one, after all - but not all female novelists are as insightful.<br /><br />I won't go into the synopsis, other reviewers have, so will concentrate on how this story affected me.<br /><br />One knows of course that the secret in the letter has to be a bombshell, and if one listens with an inner \\"eye\\" the contents can be guessed not far into the plot. Like most women, Cecilia can't resist opening the letter and what she finds is catastrophic. How this impacts on the desperate, unstable and obsessive Rachel and how the secret entangles Tess - struggling to cope with a distintegrating marriage - in another way,leads the reader inexorably into disaster.<br /><br />As the story progressed, I felt increasing concern mingled with dread. Something terrible was going to happen - and it did.<br /><br />Moriarty's plot culminates in a retribution which somehow - even though terrible - is satisfying. If that wasn't enough, however, Moriarty rounds off her work with an astounding Epilogue - and no peeping, that would be unsporting of you and spoil your enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />I could not put the book down and now am most eager to read more of this author's work.

B000FC1HBY|3.0|It was interesting to a point. But too long. I probably will buy the video or not read the rest of the series.
1439127700|4.0|Great book for anyone that is a fan of presidential history.  The book lets you in on &#34;who likes who&#34;, &#34;who couldn't stand who&#34; and &#34;why no one liked Carter&#34;.
1118490371|5.0|Over the years I have tried many books to help me to learn how to write VBA programs.  I have made the most progress with this book.  After reading only a few Chapters, I was able to write a few basic programs that solved a few longstanding problems in some of my spreadsheets.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|This was pretty good. The scene with those big troll's or whatever they were around the fire was the best scene in the movie. Worth watching.

B00A8MGIZG|1.0|Worst movie I ever saw.  I can't believe Tom Hanks wasted his time on this one. Makes Ishtar look like a movie sensation.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|This one flies under the radar for most people.  It is one of the direct to dvd Disney movies, but it could have easily been a theatrical release.  My son LOVES the pirate ships in this show, and the sci-fi element is really great.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Title: Heart of Obsidian<br /><br />Series: Psy/Changeling bk 12<br /><br />Author: Nalini Singh<br /><br />Genre: Paranormal<br /><br />A dangerous, volatile rebel, hands stained bloodred.<br />A woman whose very existence has been erased.<br />A love story so dark, it may shatter the world itself.<br />A deadly price that must be paid.<br />The day of reckoning is here.<br /><br />In Heart of Obsidian Nalini Singh once again proves why she is called the Alpha of Paranormal. This is book that will evoke all your emotions.<br /><br />Because I want everyone to feel how I felt reading it this review will be spoiler free. Well other than mentioning Kaleb as Nalini herself revealed he is the hero of this book.<br /><br />I recently went on a quest in the series to find out all I could about Kaleb and the only thing I came away with was a knowledge that there was more to this councilor than he has ever let us know.<br /><br />When it comes to his heroine, she is exactly who I thought she would be. Their story however is one that I never imagined. It is one that once you know it you understand everything Kaleb has done.<br /><br />We also find out about Kaleb's past I have to say that my heart broke for what happened to him. And you realize why he has searched so hard for the woman.<br /><br />Because of who the heroine is the changlings are in the story. And much as I was hoping we would know what Mercy and Riley are having that information is given out. As the events of this book take place almost immediately after the end of Tangle of Need I got that.<br /><br />The Civil War The Ghost, Judd and Xavier talk about does take place and is played out in a way I can see how Nalini is beginning to wrap up this story arc in the series and I can't wait to see where she is going to take the series.<br /><br />The Ghost's identity is revealed and when he explains why he did some things they make perfect sense.<br /><br />Overall this book is well worth the wait we have had. I just finished reading it and I want to read it again. Yes it is that good.<br /><br />Unless the other paranormal book that I'm waiting for this year is off the charts amazing this will be my top paranormal read of 2013.<br /><br />Grade A+<br /><br />Review By: Heather<br />- See more at: http://thebookreadinggals.com/2013/06/heart-of-obsidian-by-nalini-singh.html#sthash.Oy9pWh8S.dpuf
B00CWY76CC|4.0|says everything in the title of my opinion. but this game is fun if ur into searching for things. or if u like escape games.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|Its a great app. No problems with streaming movies or even downloading them to my kindle. There is a playback issue when streaming a movie when I am not in my WiFi. But the problem gets resolved when you give it time to load up.
B008XK69S6|3.0|I immediately loved this app upon downloading the free version, so I opted to pay for the non free one! There was NO difference! I received no &quot;license&quot; &amp; no reply from the developers to date. Other than that this app performance is outstanding! Before downloading it, I couldn't find my uploaded music files. It easily located, adds &amp; sorted them for me, adding artwork to boot! I would've given 5 stars had I seen any actual improvement in the paid upgrade or at least developer communications to explain! As it is I'm feeling a bit duped as my paid version is the same as prior. So, until I get explanation or something actually appears &quot;upgraded&quot; my rating remains. Interaction with developer response will earn an additional star &amp; actual upgrade will earn another. Other than that, great free app.... just hold off on paying for something when you get nothing additional for now.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry potter was a good movie series but not great. I owed this copy to a friend after I lost hers and was extremely happy to find this one on amazon for so cheap
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie and loved it.  The story is told by Pat and his complexity/simplicity is very heartwarming (sometimes heart wrenching).  I recommend this to anyone who asks. I look forward to reading  more by this author.
0762777931|3.0|I couldn't wait to get this book, but must admit I was a little disappointed in the recipes, only because I am a raw foodist and was hoping to see more of a raw food selection.  I haven't finished reading the book, but I do love Kris Carr's attitude and she is definitely beaming with good health.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great.  I use it every night to relax me off to sleep.  I use it when I am sitting on my deck enjoying the solitude,  I use it while taking a long soothing bath.  I love how you can incorporate multiple sounds to make your own unique sounds.  I also love I can set a timer so once I have drifted off into a nights sleep it will shut off automatically and not drain my battery.  Best app on my tablet.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|From the epilogue of The Maze Runner, we already knew that WICKED wasn't done with the Gladers yet. The Gladers themselves find this out pretty quickly at the start of The Scorch Trials, as they wake to find their 'rescuers' dead and their safe haven under attack by monsters.<br /><br />I went back and forth between three and four stars for this one. I thought there were some things about it that were better than The Maze Runner, but also some things that weren't nearly as good.<br /><br />The setting here wasn't nearly as creative and fleshed out. It started out well (and by 'well' I mean 'weird and horrible and twisted'), with dead bodies appearing and disappearing, places changing when people weren't looking, and liquid metal... things... crawling around on the ceiling and then, er, dropping down on people and eating their heads.<br /><br />Alas, it quickly segued into desert, ruined city, \\"cranks\\" (diseased zombie people), more ruined city, more diseased zombie people, more desert. From then on it felt pretty much like half the post-apocalyptic stories I've read, setting-wise, with little to distinguish itself from the crowd. There was nothing to match the strangeness of the Maze, and the cranks couldn't hold a candle to the grievers' creep factor.<br /><br />(Although I did kind of like the one crank who wandered around chanting \\"Rose took my nose, I suppose\\" and was obsessed with finding himself a new nose. He was kind of fun.<br /><br />I may have a screwed-up definition of fun.)<br /><br />Anyway, since the bizarre setting was my favorite thing about The Maze Runner, I found that aspect of The Scorch Trials to be disappointing overall. Some of the earlier parts of the book, as they were exploring this new place they'd been dumped into, kind of dragged on.<br /><br />On the other hand, once things got going the plot was a lot twistier, in a good way. Teresa was absent for a large part of the book, but when she was around, she was a lot more... hm... interesting than she was in book one. A couple of not-yet-zombified cranks joined the Gladers for part of their journey, and I had plenty of questions about their motivations. Then there was the second group of teens who'd been in a maze just like Thomas and company, who now found themselves in the desert as well, and nobody was sure if the two groups were supposed to be cooperating or competing.<br /><br />Lastly there was Thomas himself, who began having dreams of his past before he arrived in the Glade. Unlike in book one, this time we actually get to see those memories along with him. By the end of the book I was wondering if anyone was really trustworthy--Thomas included. Dashner did a great job of raising questions and building suspense in book one, and he kept it up here.<br /><br />On a third hand, though (look, just pretend I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, okay?), the general problems I had with The Maze Runner were still present here. Characterization was a bit flat and I never felt much emotional connection to the characters, with the result that all the lovely new twistiness in the plot didn't pack as much of a punch as it could have. And, like in book one, for all the intriguing questions that were raised there were never really good answers.<br /><br />It did keep me reading. I'll definitely pick up The Death Cure, because I'm really curious to see how Dashner resolves everything (or doesn't, as the case may be), but on the whole I wasn't as fond of this one as I was of book one.
145210655X|4.0|I got this book for my husband for Father's Day.  The illustrations are very cute, and there are several references to the movies.  My only complaint is that there are a couple of crude pictures that could have easily been replaced with something....well, not crude.  One example is Darth Vader and Luke playing soccer--Darth Vader is hunched over grabbing his crotch, obviously because Luke kicked him there w/the soccer ball.  It's not so funny when your 8 year-old is reading it....It's mostly a good, cute book, however, and overall, I'd still recommend it.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This is truly a classic movie!  Robert Redford and Mia Farrow are superb in their roles....their acting outperforms the Leonardo version by far.
B008B1VYP0|3.0|Originally I did not like this album. Then i listened to it more and found a handful of solid tracks.<br /><br />Definitely more of a dance/pop album... more so than their previous albums. Most of the tracks are clearly not played by the band. It sounds more like a straight up pop album, but upon closer inspection, it's not too bad.<br /><br />So far, my fav tracks<br /><br />Sad<br />Daylight<br />The man who never lied<br />Love somebody<br />fortune teller<br />Beautiful Goodbye
0671449028|5.0|This is my all time favorite book from Sandra Boynton. All the babies and toddlers I have shared this book with have loved it.<br />Definitely a classic! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is a great game. Keeps me occupied during my downtime. No complaints so far! :) Hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I can't stop watching this movie, it's funny, entertaining, and tickles the inner music geek in myself. It takes organized nerd singing and makes it fun to watch.
B004VD3YIM|3.0|Have been using it as a baby monitor so I picked it up on the Amazon app store to have on my Kindle fire.  Unfortunately it's two versions behind compared to the Google play Store.  The app seems to repeatedly have issues on my Galaxy S4. Hard to determine if us an issue that's been fixed or not since it's so out of date.  More frequent updates and I would rate it 4 stars,  5 if it stops disconnecting so frequently.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Bought this for my movie-loving step-mother as a birthday gift.  I already own it and have watched it several times...she watched it and was thrilled!
B003G4W49C|5.0|well written, thought provoking, and leaves room for the books that come after it. i highly suggest this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction writing of any kind.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|My first Jack Reacher book... Now I'm hooked!<br />Looks like I will need to get the rest of them.<br />Excellent
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to navigate and pictures are easily seen. It's nice to be able to check on an item  when you are away from your PC.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|One feels that you know the man, and now know for the first time the real story of the freeing of the slaves  and the politics behind it. All of us idealize Lincoln, yes, he is the man who did what he did -- but how did he do it? Brings Doris Kearns Goodwin's wonderful work to life for all of us to see. Highly recommended !
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a must see movie if you are interested in the history of this nation.  It appears to be a follow-up to Whoopi Goldberg's &#34;Long Walk Home&#34;.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch &#34;Long Walk Home&#34; first.  The women are all very talented and beautiful.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I had never seen the entire series and now that I have this restored Blu-Ray edition it makes an enormous viewing pleasure for those rainy, stay at home weekends!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Could not hear/understand what they were saying in some parts and felt I missed some of the story but did like the acting.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very addicting. Can't wait to read the third. I hope the movie is as good as the book. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This is an interesting way to get the message across about the importance of examine the way IT functions and its role in business today. Well written.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|We waited HOW LONG for this book and this is what we got? Really, Day? Where was the character development? Where was the plot? Where was the cliff hanger (or maybe I'm just done with this \\"trilogy\\")? I have read so many other spectacular and similar reads since book 2 that Eva and Gideon have slipped off my radar and I honestly feel like their story is old and used up. Maybe that's how Day feels because this book lacked any creativity and luster as the story just dragged and never went anywhere exciting. I'm not even going to bother with book 4 & 5.
0547848412|5.0|I bought this for our seventh grader, and she had trouble getting into this book.  After she watched the movie and loved it, she found the book to be exciting and interesting from cover to cover.  For students needing AR book points, this book has a value of 17 points.  Not only is it a must read, but is beneficial for school.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|very fun if you like skyrim or other games where you create your own avatars and fight, but challenging if you don't wanna spend money like me but still really fun
B002NN5F7A|3.0|I started to watch this and I had to turn it off.  Will watch from beginning again when I can see the whole movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Once again the writers, actors, producers, etc. of the &#34;Downton&#34; series have gotten it right.  Our favorite characters have pithy remarks and winning scenes.  The costumes, cars, and general &#34;feeling&#34; of the era are spot on as we become voyeurs into the lives of these people we have grown to love.
1583334386|5.0|Helpful and insightful.  Could apply it to everyday life and to change long held &#34;habits&#34;.  Author quotes authority and makes it real with her classroom examples.
B00915G6YE|5.0|The rating is for the show itself and the picture/sound quality. The complete lack of extras is a real drawback (and no, being able to use a code to download an episode of another show does not count as an extra as far as I'm concerned.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|Most CDs I buy have maybe 3 or 4 songs I like, but this whole album is great! Some of it is so intense, I feel like I'm in a movie! It goes without saying that the extremely talented Jared Leto did an awesome job on this album, as he has done on his past albums as well. Highly recommend!
1400069807|5.0|Want to know how the business of producing processed foods works?  This book gives all the gory details.  It will make you wonder why we don't have better regulation of the foods we eat.  As a result of reading this I have cut back dramatically on salt, sugar, and fat and have already lost 10 pounds.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This was better than I thought it would be, as the idea of a boys grown up teddy bear didn't strike me as a funny idea. They pulled it off, an it's OK viewing for home video, if there's nothing better on.

1416575464|4.0|It's a nice book to have for reference, good quality pictures and paper. Good tips on window treatments, not on upholstery though, something we all need when redecorating.
B000O78KW4|4.0|Item arrived on time however, I ordered the wrong one.  No problem though - now just need to go back online and try to locate the correct one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game encourages systematic thought and cause and effect reasoning. I was disappointed when I came to the end although it could be repeated. The upper 4 levels were challenging.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|took advantage, or so I thought, of a free offer of this book,but it was never sent to my kindle
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Excellant movie. We loved it, but we love just about anything with Helen Mirren in it.<br />Would reccomend to anyone.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|this movie was not as good as i thought it would be. the plot was so-so and i actually kept leaving the room while it was on. my husband seemed to like it tho
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Even though this is a science fiction movie it has great relevance for today.  It shows a world that was abused and polluted and had to be abandoned because it was no longer able to support life. The story is about a trash robot that finds signs of life after 700 years of desolation.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was difficult to get into but once you started to get further into the book the beginning made sense. Now that I understand more of the content I want to read it again. This time I will know what the beginning is all about.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My son bugged me forever to see this. I actually liked it, which is rare with todays movies. Appeals to girls too, so that was nice.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Had you on the edge of your seat the whole time and a great book could not put it  down
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|This movie is absolutely terrible. Slow, drifting around, lack of any real plot line. Shameful waste of acting talent. Glad we didn't pay to see this in theaters.
B009R6OTI2|4.0|I downloaded this last week to tinker with, while on my vacation. One mistake I made was thinking that I could actually use this on my iPad, as I had downloaded it for use on my Kindle-reader app. Although I did end up using the iPad kindle app to view the lessons, it clearly required the use of Aperture, my MBP and the downloadable library files. Even though I've been using Aperture for almost 2 years, I still found the lessons helpful and really feel I picked up a number of features and useful hints that I was not aware of.<br /><br />I would recommend this training to folks interested in Aperture.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This is only the first 1/3 of the book but it was very well done and close to the actual story line. Holds up to the same standards as Lord of the Rings.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've been a fan of QOTSA since their first self titled album in 1998. I like every album in it's entirety. Some people like to pick apart the albums and criticize. I just like to enjoy the music and not pretend I know how to be a musician and record producer.I think this album had so much depth and feeling to it. The track ...Like Clockwork makes me tear up. You know you're listening to music that means something to the artist when it has the ability to move you. I recommend this album to anyone that is looking to hear something great and not just commercially successful....
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a well written story.  Hard to imagine going through something like this and seeing your child and not knowing what to believe.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the trilogy twice already it is a great series of books you don't want to put it down.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|EBay made easy. I wish amazon could make a similar app. Always up to date with stuff I love it
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its fun but I have played better games like this well harder I guss not better but it is still fun
B00C061I3K|5.0|If you were expecting another Discovery, this is not it. What it is though might be the digital duo's best work to date. The album is, ironically, quite analog. Samples are replaced with live takes from musicians of real instruments. Each member of the constellation of collaborators adds his unique touch to this sentimental collection of love letters written to the muse of music. Of particular note are the tracks by Giorgio Moroder and Nile Rodgers who bring every bit of their considerable talent and acumen to bear of their respective tracks. The melodies are infectious, the production quality sublime. As such I will recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of music. As the first track goes, &#34;Let the music of your life give life back to music.&#34;
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Works very well, not a very computer literate person, but figured it out via an internet vid on youtube.  Took about 1.5 hours to properly install, aparently does the job, because once in awhile i look at the bio's of my comp, and it stays cool 'more or less, have a Intel I5 Quad core, so it runs a little hot, but this does the job.  Great for the price.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Entertaining. May become another classic. Found the concept intriguing, however script and acting not as convincing as the original Wizard of Oz.
0307279189|5.0|I'm not a reader... it takes a great book to keep my interest.  The transitioning between chapters has kept me very intrigued and interested in getting to the  next.  Good stories, tips, etc.  Great book.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater (twice) when it first came out.  There were parts where I was at the edge of my seat and jumped a few times.  However, it was even more real in 3D--I actually screamed out loud during the velocoraptor scene (my husband was laughing at me!).  Needless to say, 3D added a whole new dimension of excitement!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Absolutely love this game! Challenging but doable. Also convinces my husband to get it. We both run down our kindle batteries playing this as often as we do.
1551113082|4.0|This book was in great condition.It hardly looks used except for the minor highlighting inside. Definitely a good study book for class.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Was having problems running some aspects of some of my games, namely Supreme Commander Forged Alliance (me vs. 3 or more comps) and Starcraft 2 (wings of liberty at the time)  Before i had something about 1/2 the power of this, and it could not handle more than 3 comps on Supreme Comander or too many units on Starcraft WOL, i had installed new power suply and motherboard, but naturaly didnt rly help, but as soon as i installed this, oh man, i can run Ultra grafics on anything with a full game of Supreme Comander on 250unit cap, (more than that is REALLY crazy game) and no lag, at all!  You can follow the instructions it comes with, but as recomended by product comments, i also looked on youtube for a vid. had no probs finding an installation vid.  Only took an hour or two to physically install it, and then another half an hour to figure out best optimizations.  Bear in mind that i am in no way, shape, or form a computer 'guru,' everything i know (and it aint alot) was taught by my brother.  If i can do, you defenatly can, and its very good product for the price.  I do alot of gaming and it works very well for me.
B0007KTBIU|4.0|i love this movie it came out on my birthday ... It is a great movie to add to my collection for when i have my own kids
B005LAII0I|4.0|This is just off the wall enough to be funny but not so much that it leaves you wondering!  We like it.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Peter Jackson's team has done it again. Everything about this film is done right. The locations are gorgeous,<br />the acting is great and the make-up and special effects are top form.  It all puts the viewer right in the middle<br />of the adventure.<br /><br />This film is paced well, giving the audience needed breaks between being besieged. I found myself rooting<br />for it not to end. Every film has to and this one leaves us at a point of begging for more. This is the first part<br />of a legendary tale of devotion, the quest for a home and a character's growing maturity.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app because it up dates me on the weather coming and I love the videos too!!!!Want to be on the latest weather? Get this app!!!! :) :)
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a very good story line for this type of book.  I think it is better than the Harry Potter books for kids because it is not so dark.  Adults will enjoy it too.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My grandchildren love mythology with all it's mystical beasts and this movie did not disappoint them. They lved the story, there was plenty of action to keep them interested all the way to the end. Highly recommend.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|a great movie i love some of the original Disney movies they are some of my favorites.. Great for my collection
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game and the graphics and cool stuff is even better than the first one! The monster doing the chasing is kindle scary though! O.o<br /> Love it!!!
B001NA6096|5.0|Love this movie! Amazing acting, beautiful dialogues and a story that will touch your heart. Movies like this don't come too often.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love it! so addicted to this game! really makes you use your mind and figure out the clues. definatley recommend this game to everyone.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great book that speaks truths about the status of women in the workplace with real advice on how to lean in and live up to our full potential.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I loved Michael Chiklis in The Commish but to see him in something so completely different was great! Shows just what a great actor he really is! The show is VERY graphic but very realistic and controversial. I'll definitely be buying more.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|The title is exactly what you get!  However it is a quick read its guidelines can be applied to any situation when needing to survive.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|John Grisham does it again. A good read, start very slow but progresses into an excellent adventure. It contains so many twists and turns that it is pretty hard to put it down. I would highly recommend it to old or new Grisham fans.<br />Keep on writing Mr. Grisham, we would certainly appreciate it.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Even though the entire movie just involves two people talking to each other, it draws you into their magical world and leaves you wanting more.
B00BB22GQM|1.0|I bought this CD based on Rolling Stone Magazine's 4 1/2 Star review! What a mistake. This cd is boring. There is nothing good on here lyrically or instrumentally! Slow boring songs. Not a single song of any notice. Save your money. Don't waste a Weekend with these Vampires!
1416955070|4.0|I really loved this whole series. There are many reasons why I would recommend this series to a number of people. However, I must admit, I was disappointed with the beginning of City of Bones.<br /><br />My friend told me to read it, and I promised her I would read the whole thing. However I almost reneged on my promise when I began the book. I was highly disappointed in my friends taste of books... It was poorly written, with what I thought were poor attempts at being hip and a teenager.<br /><br />As I forced myself through it, I began to uncover much more in the books... Delightful romance, action, etc. Ar first I thought it would be a typical love-triangle a la Twilight (admittedly, I loved Twilight). If you think this, just read on. Trust me, it isn't a love triangle. In addition, Cassandra Clare incorporates many references and allusions to other great works, including Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Dickens, and the bible.<br /><br />Also, if you are as shocked by the ending of this first book and are having trouble finding it in you to continue reading, as I did, keep going. It only gets better!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I particularly like the flexibility from one player to another.  Also, Game of Thrones is a great show.  I can't stop watching
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book was by far the most memorable book I have ever read.  I have never read anything so intricate and enthralling that I never put the book down!  A must read for any fan of literature.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Pretty good album and I like most of the songs in this album also. Keep up the good work and produce a song to outdo &#34;I Need You Now&#34;!
0385474547|5.0|Anybody  reading  the  book  Things  Falls  Apart  by  Chinua  Achebe  objectively ,  will  find  the  flow  of  the  story  smooth ,  and  will  no  doubt  conclude  that  the  author  is  a  person  of  high  academic  excellence  in  the  field  of  Literature  in  English .<br /><br />At  the  beginning ,  when  one starts reading  the  book ,  the  only  force  that  drives  the  reader  to  continue  reading  it  is  the  anxiety  to  discover  which  things  have  fallen  apart  that  the  author  is  talking  about .  In  other  words ,  the  reader  is  motivated  by  an  urge  to  get  to  know  the  connection  between  the  title  of  the  book  and  the  story  that  the  author  is  telling  in  the  book .  The  way  the  story  is  presented  causes  a  step-by-step  increase  in  the  urge  as  one  continues  reading  the  book  and  by  the  end  of  it ,  the  reader  sees  how  the  author  has  perfectly  tied  the  title  of  the  book  to  the  story .<br /><br />The  story  is  a  narration  of  the  day-to-day's  life  of  the  people  of  Umuofia  and  the  eight  neighboring  villages .  The  main  characters  in  the  story  are  Okonkwo  and  the  people  of  the  village  of  Umuofia,  and  then  the  white  man .  Achebe  introduces  these  characters  in  the  story ,  each  one  at  an  appropriate  time .  He  starts  with  Okonkwo  whom  he  says  is  well  known  throughout  the  nine  villages  and  that  Okonkwo's  fame  rests  on  his  solid  personal  achievement .<br /><br />From  the  story ,  we  learn  that  the  people  of  Umuofia  and  the  surrounding  eight  villages  are  a  people  who  have  a  deep-rooted  culture  with  strict  rules  which  are  derived  from  the  departed  spirits  of  their  ancestors .  The  white  man's  modern  system  of  government  and  his  modern  way  of  worship  are  not  known  to  these  people ,  and  when  he  tries  to  introduce  the  new  systems  to  them ,  the  people  bitterly  resent  them .<br /><br />One  reading  this  story  soon  finds  out  that  the  author  has  arranged  his  thoughts  in  a  logical  order  and  this  provides  a  smooth  transition  from  one  paragraph  or  character  to  the  next  one .  In  other  words ,  when  reading  the  book ,  one  can  correctly  guess  or  anticipate  what  is  to  follow  next .<br /><br />In  terms  of  language  and  expression ,  the  author  has  insured  that  he  communicates  at  a  level  that  most  people  who  speak  the  English  language  will  comfortably  follow  the  story.  He  has  deliberately  avoided  the  use  of  difficult  English  vocabularies  and  expressions  in  this  book,  and  in  that  way ,  he  has  widened  the  scope  of  his  prospective  readers  or  audience .<br /><br />The  last  paragraph  of  p183  of  the  book  says  \\"Okonkwo  deeply  grieved .  And  it  was  not  just  a  personal  grief .  He  mourned  for  the  clan ,  which  he  saw  breaking  up  and  falling  apart ,  and  he  mourned  for  the  warlike  men  of  Umuofia ,  who  had  so  unaccountably  become  soft  like  women,\\" (Achebe,  Sep. 1994 ) ,  and  in  the  last  paragraph  of  p176  of  the  same  book ,  Obierika  is  telling  Okonkwo ,  \\"The  white  man  is  very  clever.  He  came  quietly  and  peaceably  with  his  religion .  We  were  amused  at  his  foolishness  and  allowed  him  to  stay .  Now  he  has  won  our  brothers ,  and  our  clan  can  no  longer  act  like  one .  He  has  put  a  knife  on  the  things  that  held  us  together  and  we  have  fallen  apart\\"( Achebe,  Sep. 1994 ).<br /><br />The  above  two  citations  together  give  the  book  its  title  \\"Things  Fall  Apart.\\"<br /><br />In  conclusion ,  the  author  did  a  great  job .  Many  schools  around  the  world  have  chosen and  included  this  book  in  the  set  of  their  text  books  for  their  Literature  in  English  course .<br /><br />I recommend this book without any reservation to whoever wants to buy it.
B001BZGA8Y|5.0|Swatch never dissapoint you ! It looks great o my girlfriend wrist, besides those diamons decals around the body looks great!
B00AW57L96|4.0|My first book read online and I really enjoyed it, a few twists throughout the book, kept me guessing and couldn't put it down - hard on dad when you are mother of 3 young children !!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|you can play the computer, or opponents online.  the upgrades are almost unlimited. its a really fun game to play.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I disliked how this book was so drawn out.  And how it resembled New Moon in couple of aspects.  Overall this was 500 page filler with previews to vital parts of the third and fourth books.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I like Lady Antebellum very much, they are a great group and I do like most of their songs, especially I Need you Now!
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|These guys rock and I listen to this CD all the time. It's a good way to get your blood flowing for the drive to work in the morning!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I can't say that I can wrap my mind around the whole concept. But, I intend to keep trying. I really like the concept and the story!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|well its fun but I can only invade enemy bases 2/3 of the time and can only visit 15 out of 33 ally bases for hearts fix that and ill rate it higher. and needing to have a minimum amount of word to rate it? how stupid
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|the car flips out very easy, but upgrade as often as possible, and the game can be addicting.  sometimes it's not about speed, but controlling the car.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This book fills in a bunch of details that the movie could not include.  Overall this book is a great but short read for the price being a little inflated.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I didn't get a chance to see this in the theater but as a Civil War history buff, I knew it was something I would be interested in.  I didn't realize it focused so closely on just a few months of Lincoln's presidency, but it was well done.  I did find it hard to keep track of the characters; I felt like I needed a score card or a &#34;this is who you will see&#34; set of portraits at the beginning of the movie so I knew who was who.
B000ID37T0|5.0|Al Pacino gives an awesome performance in this timeless classic! This movie is unforgettable and a must-have for any collecter of the great ones to be treasured.  Definitely a keeper!  :)
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Lighthearted and fun, yet a good sentimental plot; we are not as different from our parents as we may think. No matter how irritating or odd they can be at times parents and their adult children have much to offer one another.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|choose be the hero, or the anti-hero.  easy to play without ever buying anything, but if you want the shortcut, it is available.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was rollercoaster ride from start to finish.  I enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly to any gamer or geek out there!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This was a fairly faithful adaptation of the Tolkien novel.  We saw it twice in the theater and I knew I wanted to own it for myself when it was available on DVD.
007174889X|5.0|This book is my bible on medical school, I like and the price was ok, so I really recommend this book.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Russell Crowe displayed the kind of acting that is uncommon and that cannot be replicated. He so much inhabited the character of Maximus that I dare anyone to see this movie to the end without tears in their eyes--My gratitude to him!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I play Super Smash Brothers Melee competitively, so I find out really fast if a controller doesn't do what it needs to do. Just about any third-party controller, one which doesn't have &#34;Nintendo Gamecube&#34; printed above the start button, is garbage which will fall apart in a matter of months, and annoy you with sticky buttons, weak trigger button springs, and input lag until it does so. This controller is absolutely the same sturdy, responsive, ergonomic first party controller that you got with your Gamecube, with the single exception being a longer cord, (which is definitely a useful improvement).<br /><br /> It's hard to find good Gamecube controllers these days, since Nintendo has stopped manufacturing these. I don't know whether there's a cheaper place to get these (shipping costs to get it from Japan are a pain), but the product itself is the right one to buy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Read book 1 and could not wait to read book 2.  Could not put either book down.  Really enjoyed the history of  a very difficult  time involving families in Wales, England, Germany, America, and Russia.  The book brought them connected in a very interesting way.  Hope to see a book 3 in this trilogy.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|This processor has almost no cache on it, but you cannot expect much from a $50 CPU.  Benchmark tests place it around the power of an average Core 2 Duo and I would have to agree.  This processor is good for the basics like internet browsing and running your average, non-intensive program without too many issues, but I don't recommend using it for video editing/transcoding.  If you are trying to decide how to score the processing power, check out Passmark's tests and look at how many levels and how much cache (L1, L2, and possibly L3 on fancy chips) it has.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love this product, I really recommend this cd, and about the shipping, it was pretty fast. It was a present and it accomplished its commitment.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|It is too hard to find channels because you have too select tons of states and country's just to find a channel so I think it is a total waste of money!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What is NOT to like about this app?  I like to know about the weather, and the 10 day forecasts; especially, I like to know about the weather where my family lives in other parts of the USA.  It has pollen counts, alerts, and etc.  Very informative!
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|Amazed at the storyline, incredible the way people's lives intertwine the way they do. Great cast! Everyone does an upstanding performance!
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|This is such a good app for finding free books to read on kindle. I have used it for a while and think it is good as you can read all catagories to find what you want to read each day.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Top notch movie. The cinematography is grand.  Grant has such savoir faire.  Leo G Carroll as the head of the intelligence agency is a quality supporting role that is not to miss.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Different from the modern vampire movies... which makes it awesome! It's also a very realistic story, therefore most viewers can relate.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A very good game.  Helps you to wind down from a busy day, and takes your mind elsewhere.  Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't .  Good game!
B00881VLCE|4.0|It's a great for those who love jigsaw puzzles.  Great fun!
B001VNB54A|5.0|We had to pay close to S$200 for this just last year, so when I found it at this price, I had to have it.<br />Looks exactly the same quality as the &#34;Band of Brothers Bluray Set&#34; I bought back home..
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I think that this game is a lot of fun and is quite challenging and addictive. I enjoy playing it in my spare time
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It I  like grand thief auto but in kindle I really enjoy this game and its worth the money. In the game you can run around and beat people up cops can chase you and you can do missions and buy guns and clothes I enjoy it a lot
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great story, well written.  Can't wait for the next one. I was enthralled , amused, breathless and the end came too soon.<br />.com
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Very good movie, and it was a REAL story, to boot!  You won't be sorry to watch this movie, especially if you have children.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|As a long time mystery reader, I like whodunnits better than thrillers or conspiracy plots but this was interesting with wonderful characters, especially the Camel Club.  Plot twists kept me guessing.View of the US as evil a little too repetitive.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Overall, I like the game but there's not enough to do.  As you level up there are fewer quests to do to make the point collection process not seem so boring.  I'm not saying they should cram the quests down your throat like Farmville, but something more than one quest while collecting 74,000 points would be nice. (I'm on level 18)  Also, it would be nice to have a view of your entire reef, not just sections.  Graphics are very nice, fish are cute and the idea of designing your reef as you learn interesting facts about life in the ocean is fun.
B000002OVJ|5.0|It was the beginning of 1970 and The Who had found success with there recent album \\"Tommy\\". For there next tour The Who played virtually all of Tommy and a selected set list of songs for a 1969-1970 tour. The Who were also notorious for performing extraordinary live shows, with extended jamming, smashing guitars, whirling microphones, and Keith Moon going ballistic on hid drum kit. So Pete set a concert at Leeds University and Hull City Hall. The Hull tapes malfunctioned, so the Who were left with Leeds.<br /><br />In 1970 when it was first released it only had 6 songs. Now with the recent deluxe remastered edition you get the whole concert. What makes Live at Leeds so great is it shows The Who's best playing. Explosive rocking territories no one at the time dared go, musically and lyrically. Like in Magic Bus, Pete plays a Bo Diddly type beat, then when Keith's drums goes off like a bomb, it turns to heavy metal. The jamming riffs and such talented playing from Pete, John, and Keith. And excellent singing from Roger makes you forget trying to put albums in lists and trying to examine every detail, it makes you just want to jam and forget anything on your mind and just be happy jamming. No album besides this one does that for me, maybe that's why I love it so much. But, every critic and most people become a believer that this is the greatest live album of all time, and to me one of the greatest albums, period, of all time. From one of the best concerts ever played by any band.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Thought this would be another of its kind but it is well written and has a good plot plus provocative.  Every thing a girl wants now and then.  Enjoy!
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Has you on the edge of your seat anticipating what's going to happen in the psy-changeling world. The love story is up there with Lucas/Sasha and Hawkes/Siena.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|This will probably be known as the film that solidifies Matthew McConaughey's place as one of the great actors of our time.  Most wouldn't have thought that as recently as maybe 5 years ago.  But he's impressive as Mud, a charming man on the run, hiding from the law on a small Arkansas island in the middle of the Mississippi River.<br /><br />Holed up in boat stuck in a tree during the last flood, Mud is trying to hook up with his girlfriend, Juniper (excellent Reese Witherspoon).  Two 14 year old boys, find the boat and claim it as their own, until they discover the residence of Mud.  In an unusually remarkable performance by Tye Sheridan as Ellis, he portrays an honest sense of age transition most of us will remember.  His best friend Neckbone (a nice first time performance by Jacob Lofland) is an orphan being raised by his uncle (Michael Shannon who starred in director Jeff Nichols only other film, \\"Take Shelter\\").  Ellis believes in people and he believes in love, having fallen for a high school senior.<br /><br />Neckbone is leery of people, including Mud but is guided by Ellis's instincts.  Together they work to get Mud and Juniper paired up and help with their escape from the law and the family of the man Mud killed back in Texas.  Ellis's own life is falling apart.  His father (Ray McKinnon) and mother (Sarah Paulson) are separating.  The mother is tired of living on the river in a houseboat.  Father and son like the arrangement.  Sam Shepard has a turn as the man who was a father-figure to Mud and who gives clues to his neighbor Ellis about the Mud-Juniper relationship.  Mud and Ellis form a special bond.  Both are incurable romantics which keeps them focused on their goal.<br /><br />This is a superbly acted, beautiful film; well written, with wonderful photography and a perfect musical score.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer from Lionsgate is just as good as the film.  With a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film sparkles with some excellent lighting choices showing well on video.  Often using hand held cameras, we get some excellent close-ups, which offers excellent detail.  Good contrast prevails throughout.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is superb.  As noted, much of the film takes place on a remote, uninhabited island in the middle of a river.  The surrounds are in play here as the natural environment is well recorded, birds, bugs, wind envelope the viewer.  The musical score sounds great as well.  Subtitles include Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a commentary track with director/writer Nichols and a separate segment where he details his desire to make the film.  Three other brief pieces focus on the casting, the locale and the sequence called the Snake Pit.lighting choices showing well on video.

B003INBOEM|5.0|This has become one of my all time favorite martial arts movies.  If you are a fan of the genre then you must see this film.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Loved this game so much we ended up buying everyone their own kindle fires. Mainly because everyone had to have their own world. The downside is it takes outrageous amounts of coins and hours to achieve much. Also its a pain to earn acorns. Seems to want you to spend real money for the fun stuff. Great way to waste hours of time. Keeps children busy for hours! Even Mom's! Overall it's a fun game. Just very time consuming and slightly addictive.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's a great app if you want a strategy game, an entertaining game, or if you just want to<br />kill everybody on earth! the reason I got it is because it looked like a cheap little app but I didn't know how AWESOME it was! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B00169N0BK|1.0|Here is my initial review of the color munki.

I deleted CS3 so I can't verify, only speculate.<br /><br />If X-Rite won't support Adobe CC, I would like my money back.<br /><br />Update June 18:<br /><br />I received an email from X-rite stating that the CM produces ICC profiles and that is enough to match my prints to the monitor and that if Adobe no longer supports ICC profiles, that I should ask Adobe why they don't.<br /><br />Seems to me that X-rite and Adobe are not playing nice with each other. The major reason why I purchased the munki is because I wanted my Adobe products to work with the CM.<br /><br />So the process isn't so easy and seamless as they would like to have you believe, but this is no longer a surprise for me and it shouldn't be for anyone else.<br /><br />My next step is to figure out if I can really get Adobe programs to accept ICC profiles (they should be able to, but then again, I just got burned by X-rite, so...) or return the CM within Amazon's 30 day return policy.<br /><br />Thanks X-rite for not coming right out and saying it isn't seamless, but here's how to make it work. I wonder how well they support their higher end clients (commercial printers and design agencies). I would like to rate this product no stars but can't.<br /><br />Part II: Gray scale blues<br /><br />The CM can't even print and black and white without it being in green!<br /><br />June 23rd.<br /><br />The CM, in my final thoughts does work, sort of. I would recommend before buying it though, to look at your printer's settings as it may or may not have a setting that makes it following the monitor's profile, which may be enough.

B00AIUUXHC|2.0|fun untill it reset its self on me when it glitched. was saving up money for great white shark and then i was about to buy it and it glitched. it shut down my kindle for a day! then when I got it back on it was a only a lvl 1 reef shark... all that work... for nothing.... that's why I gave up on it. &gt;:(
B004I11VZ0|4.0|If you haven't seen it, then you're missing out.  Hands down one of the best martial arts movies to come out.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|If you are a Quinten Tarrantino fan, you have to have this movie.  It is not for the faint of heart, but it is very good.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love having this movie, The movie is awesome but, I think the second disc explaining the making of the Hobbit is just as awesome.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|There is so much pain that is revealed, and so much hope that pushes back against that pain. It is rare to read an account of such deprivation, neither glamorized nor suppressed, without connecting to one's own imperfect story, for perfection does not exist. This book is full of forgiveness, acceptance, and faith in the human spirit. It is filled with love and language, and of course flowers. Gentle, yet strong, unflinching and embracing.<br /><br />I recommend it to all.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|One long car chase/action scene. Boring. Repetitive.<br /><br />Acting was average at best. There was maybe one decent twist in the story that saved it from being a one star review.
0753541637|5.0|THIS BOOK GIVES ANY WOMAN A SHOT OF HOPE THAT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITH WILLINGNESS, HELP FROM OTHER PEOPLE, BELIEF IN SELF AND A DESIRE TO SUCCEED. THIS BOOK OPENS UP YOUR EYES TO HOW RESTRICTED (LIMITED) WE ARE CONDITIONED TO OUR CIRCUMSTANCES IN LIFE BUT IT ALSO TEACHES US WE CAN DO ALMOST ANY THING IF WE CHANGE OUR THINKING. THIS BOOK IS THE CATALYST I NEED TO KEEP BELIEVING  AND NEVER GIVE UP OR NEVER GIVE IN. THIS BOOK DEFINITELY NUDGES ME TO TRY HARDER.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Really good acting, but the voices were not quite as good as the theatre soundtrack.  Still would recommend it as worth having.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|Its a comedy and expect it to be, apart from the end where he got a head from &#34;the head&#34; everything else were decent.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I laughed a few good times, was surprised a few times and did not expect a lot of what happened. The movie started very slow, but sped up fast. The old was turned new again. I will watch this movie again.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The effects and lighting and colors along with a good story line played by good actors pull one into the movie; which come more to life in clear Blu Ray 3D. I bought it when it first came available to buy and paid $89.00 for it. I really struggled with myself deciding whether to pay that much for a movie, however regardless how it sometimes pains me when I think of the money I would have saved by waiting to buy it, I actually have little regret over it because I have been able to enjoy it longer and share the enjoyment and awe with other with this classic film. I believe this movie will go down in history as one of the best sci fi movies in history.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this without really knowing what I was getting into and was exhausted, like, five minutes into it but after working on Level 1 for about a month, I could already see big improvements in muscle tone and cardio endurance. I read some of the negative reviews and agree that this workout can be hard on the knees, but I thought that the beginner modifications really helped me keep good form and not injure myself. I definitely could not perform like Natalie! I'm currently staying in Level 2 as I tried 3 and it was way too hard for me to get throughout without repeated breaks. I love this DVD and appreciate whenever a workout routine can be done with minimal necessities, such as one set of weights and not a slew of products I'd have to go out and buy. As someone who has slaved away for hours at the gym, doing endless hours on the stair climber and elliptical with moderate weight training, I found that 20 minutes of her techniques provided far greater improvement and weight loss than I was getting on my own. I will definitely look into additional DVDs.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I thought this was such a great movie in the theatre and had to have it for my home movie library.  I found things on the second viewing I did not notice in the first.  Great movie and acting!
B002O6FBW0|4.0|Anyone who has the slightest interest in cinema as an art form needs to see this legendary film at least once in their lifetime. The print shows its age but like a rough sounding Robert Johnson 78 it is well worth putting up with for the brilliance of the cinematography and set design.
B002413TY2|5.0|I love the Transporter movies. This one was faster and more action packed than the other two. The lady in the movie is very hot and the cars are great. I will watch this one again.
B00005OCMR|3.0|This is quite pleasing to watch as an exercise in graphic video. Music and design are nicely interwoven into patterns of sound and picture which are gratifying for a limited amount of time. By chance, I saw the picture in two  parts, on two successive days, and found it enjoyable. Had it been one day, I would have limited to that. As for the story, I assume that is directed at younger devotees of video games and the like who can take pleasure in the other-wise uninteresting interactions of the figures representing programmers and programs.
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|Another shoot 'em up Arnold flick. This time the supporting cast is sub-par and the plot is worse. But if you are looking for a loud and fiery action flick it's not bad.
B00A7W29BE|2.0|I thought this app would be a little better than CamScanner but that's not the case.  Genius Scan does not allow you to save a photo in PDF until you send it off to email or another app.  The photos of documents were not very clear and hard to read.  I did like how easy it was to save documents,however, I will be uninstalling this app.
B00AEFXE3Q|4.0|I love this film, as it was originally cut. So much so I repurchased it on Blu Ray both for the added clarity and the 30 minutes or so additional footage of the &#34;Directors&#34; Cut. I do have a few issues with the extended version. Without going into a scene-by-scene comparison there are many lines added into the middle of the scenes, additional scenes, and in some cases I believe a few lines edited out so that it gave me(who's watched this movie at least 5 or 6 times previously) the feeling that the film was closer to 50% &#34;new&#34;. I'm not sure I like the &#34;Directors Cut&#34; version better, so since it unfortunately isn't included on the BluRay I would strongly encourage people to hang onto their original DVD copies. Sometimes giving the Director license to expand on a film that was already 2 hours long just shows why the film was edited down for succinctness in the first place. Not sorry I purchased it by any means but know you're getting a fairly distinct, different cut that to me doesn't better the original.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I hoped that this would be a fast paced action movie, but I was wrong. The movie stays at a slow pace. I did like the movie. It was nice to watch. Not much to say about this one. Could have been better.
1451620829|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the long awaited biography from Peter Criss called  Make Up to Break Up -  My Life In and Out of Kiss.<br /><br />It is the best written amd most detailed of the four biographies. It is also the funniest as Peter Criss can laugh at himself.<br /><br />Criticism - That Make Up to Break Up is about an ageing rock star who discusses the road, sex, groupies, orgies, more drug excess, being kicked out of the band than re-uniting. What else would expect from am ageing rock star? Philosophy or resolving the world's economic woes. Yes, or the curious, there are numerous vivid descriptions of orgies, one night stands and explicit  descriptions for women's private parts. You will wear gloves next time you pick up a copy of the Hotter than Hell, especially a vinyl copy.<br />I recommend this book for rock fans and KISS fans alike. Rock fans should focus on the years 1978 to 1980. Peter Criss was history, made history and lived through it. Arguably, he was in the world's most successful band in the mid to late 1970's, specifically 1977-78 and saw ego, or the plural ego's rip them apart. To this day KISS are cited in various encyclopedia's as the United States most successful band in the 1970's.<br /><br />For KISS fans, the biographies are now complete. Judging fron the reviews I have read about No Regrets and Make Up to Break Up both Ace Frehley and Pete,r Criss have been \\"gagged\\" i.e. legally threatened by Gene Simmons. Peter Criss provides more detail than Ace, but nevertheless its fairly watered down. Ace's bio in comparison has \\"no meat whatsover.' Ace's on-going royalties are higher than Peter's. More about this later<br /><br />I wanted to know what actually occurred from 1978 to 1980 when Criss was<br />fired. I also wanted to hear \\"the dirt\\" on the failure of the Solo Albums AND the Dynsaty Tour.<br /><br />Solo Albums - Commercial Failure so Colossal that wipes out Casablanca<br />Solo albums Don't Sell -  Peter covers what I long suspected. A failure. Bill Aucoin on the Bill Aucoin Tapes from memmory alludes to the fact that the whole Solo Album project was hubris and KISS got what they deserved .... karma. According to Peter the Solo Albums sold the same amount that a KISS album sold, that is about 1.2 million copies. That figure corresponds exactly to what was returned to Casablanca .... a mammoth 2.8 million copies were returned. Casablanaca went under 2 years later.  In 1978 KISS were selling more lunchboxes than they were singles or albums. Peter glosses over the blatant failure of his Solo Album AND highlights the failure of Gene Simmons.<br /><br />Failure of the Gene Simmons album -<br />  A quote straight from the book -  \\"Ace's was typical Hendrixy thing and Gene's the most bizzare, almost a pop album. He later wrote that his intent was to \\"piss of KISS fan;s and push it in their faces that their musical tasrtes were one-dimensional and his weren't.\\"  The KISS Fans pushed back and after the Solo album release, and, the failure as KISS's.<br /><br />Paul Stanley<br />  A petty jealous figure who is/was narcasisstic yet unsure of himself. I pegged this ages ago and in my review of Unmasked - PLEASE read my review - I claim that Stanley was jealous and tried to write numerous I Was Made for Loving You's but failed. I was glad to read Pete's book as I was correct, as he assert what I guessed. Stanley attempted to write I Was Made for Loving You again and again. I claim that Unmasked was this attempt .... but what a failure.<br /><br />I Was Made for Loving You.<br />KISS's only international Number One. Ace hated the chucka- chucka- chucka- chucka- lead guitar line AND the blatant disco ovetones. Accordong to Criss, the demon too thought it \\"too disco\\" but it brought in the dollars. I Was Made for Loving You went Top 10 and cost KISS their US audience. The following tour in 1979 had only luke warm ticket sales and Peter Criss sabotages that tour.<br /><br />Dynasty Tour - Pete admits to sabotaging that tour. He played too fast or slow for Paul threw drum sticks at Gene Simmons (which resulted in backstage drama with Criss holding a broken bottle threatening Simmons) and got him in the back of the head. Peter left Ace alone.  Frehley was so spaced out from alcohol and drugs by late 1979 there is not much that you can do to him.<br /><br />Belly Laugh<br />I laughed out loud when Pete discusses how a flying Gene Simmons was caught like a puppet on a string.  When \\"the contrapation' went wrong it was pure comedy. To add to the comedy, Peter alleges that Gene continued maklng monster noises which made him look even more stupid.  Criss notes that it happened TWICE ... Ha ha ha. Paul Stanley in a post-reunion flying outfit had the same happen to him. Criss concludes that Simmons and Stanley took it out on the staff as they don't like \\"looking like fools.' I laughed til I cried and re-read the paragraph several times.<br /><br />There are other exposes by Peter Criss throughout Make up to Break Up so please read it. Only a book from Bill Aucoin's estate will surpass Peter's efforts.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and Peter's ghost writer is quite good. There are two constant annoyances throughout the book. Peter is close to illiterate, keeps claiming that he is a Brooklyn street gang affiliate who collects guns and was in a gang. I agree with Gene on this one - take NO NOTICE. Criss is a spoilt brat who is to weak to be a gang member. He required morphine shots for sore arms, cries at the drop off a hat, is a drug addict ho easily relapses, is jealous and angry about Ace and whinges about everything. Both Peter and Ace in No Regrets constantly let us know their rock stars.<br /><br />On a positive, he survived male BREAST CANCER and speaks out against it. Peter has probably saved countless lives as he has used his rock star status for good.<br /><br />5 out of 5 for the content awareness and humor.
B00AMS4H2M|5.0|T.I. has really done his thing on this... I love Hello Video... It's so unique... I actually live by these words...
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Totally didn't expect this movie to be that great.  What a pleasant surprise!  When you take into account that this actually happened, it's incredible.
B000000OU0|1.0|This CD shoild titled Eagles worst hits I litterally fast forwarded each song due to the drudgery of listening to each song.  There was one or two songs that I liked, but I didn't realize before putchase. In my opinion this is the worst group of songs I have ever heard from the eagles. This is just one mans opinion of course.  Look at the songs closely you will sea they are dogs of songs.
0061950726|3.0|I thought the history of the orphan trains was very interesting. Vivian the orphan, Molly the foster child, two different times, different places, similar story. The story held my attention for two thirds of the book. I feel either Christina lost something or I missed it, but the ending was a little weak for me. Enjoyed reading it, used it for this months book club selection. Will see what my book club has to say. Good beach read.
B005L12SB2|3.0|Great box set of music just a little disappointed with the packaging & sleeves. Don't get me wrong I'm more into the music than packaging it's just that I don't think the sleeves will last long if used regularly (That's why I downloaded to pc) Also the sleeves don't list the bonus tracks but are listed as I guess the original albums were. This was more of an issue to me than the packaging, at least have all the songs on the cd listed on the sleeves.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Bought as free app of the day, awhile ago, still playing it now. Fun to get all stars. Not hard, but can take a few tries to get all 3 stars on each level.
1439153663|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  I read through pages and pages of rapes and physical abuse, and more peaceful times followed by more physical abuse.  If you can read these things and not feel sick and keep reading, then this is the book for you.  If these actions haunt you, don't bother.  They physical abuse is tossed into the story, not resolved, and is never really addressed.  I'd rather read something else.  I put it in the trash as I don't even want to give this monster to charity.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally can not play this game. I, in all fairness of the word, suck. However, my husband and kids (ages 6 and 7) LOVE this game. They could play for hours at a time. My daughter has unlocked most of the characters and working on the last one now, she's getting almost as good as her dad. My son also is doing extremely good at this game, definitely works the hand/eye coordination! (apparently something I don't have HAHA)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini delievers again, And the Mountains Echoed is intoxicating. When I'm finished reading it, I am going to listen to the cd. I want to hear his characters voices in my ears. Loved every word. Thanks Khaled, it was music to my eyes.
B000WCBPOG|2.0|Saw the movie thought this would be fun.  Family hated this album.  Not an easy listening selection from the movie.
0375507256|3.0|Full disclosure:  My expectations were high for this book because they made it into a movie, and the trailer for that movie made the book sound like a deep novel about how we're all connected (or something like that).  Also, my favorite books are Count of Monte Cristo and Les Mis, both wonderful novels with different story lines that intersect and influence each other in ways that blew my mind.  This book is not like that.<br /><br />The structure of the book was creative and I enjoyed each individual story and each presentation style, but I kept hoping to turn the page and read some incredible passage that linked all the stories together.  That didn't happen.  The stories are only loosely related (a couple of weak references to past stories and future events in each story), so the book turned out to be little better than just a collection of short stories presented in an innovative fashion.  However, like I said, each story is pretty cool and fun to read.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I am wanting to watch it again and again.  Daniel Day Lewis was excellent; Sally Field was a surprise and also was excellent.  She just doesn't come to the screen as a serious dramatic actress.  But pulled it off well!
B009O2XY12|5.0|Great game! I used this game to pass the time at work or even to play before bed if I can't sleep. The levels are diverse enough to keep me entertained and not too difficult that I don't want to play anymore.
B00AKKS278|5.0|The book will connect with you in more ways than you can imagine. Every part of the miracle morning process will make sense. Think of the program as a guide to creating a daily snowball effect into your daily routines that will help super charge your life and goals. Highly recommended reading!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Really enjoy this one. Especially like the higher levels, they can quite challenging.  I definitely recommend it. Hope to see more like this one.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I anticipated this album very much and was honestly a bit disappointed after my first listen.<br /><br />After the second listen however, it all became clearer. The album is a wonderful next step for Daft Punk and is fully representative of their skill and evolution as musicians.<br /><br />This a must listen for any music lover.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|That said, you have to be able to get past the violence and vulgarities.  If this story is in any way a reflection of the true south during the Civil War, pre- to post-, it paints a very sad picture of our early year's interpretation of democracy.  Brutal!  Hard to watch!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|typical game of creating your own space. Making sure you have enough tables/food to feed your guests and keeping them satisfied. Time consuming for serious players.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|sad to finish a book you become one with. then you know how great it is. Love his description of Afghanistan, how it was and what it has become.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I LOVE littlest pet shops so much!It is like a obsession!!!!!!!!!!! I was so happy when I got to download this game.

B00CW665VI|2.0|Am I the only one that thinks this writing is sophomoric and stilted?  The male perspective just doesn't work.  I'm going to force myself to finish it, but seriously?  The ratings are off the charts for this book.  Simplistic plot, poor character development and the dialog is just poorly written.  There are so many better erotic writers, not digging this one.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Although the storyline has an interesting twist and had a somewhat charming troll by the name of Edward, the gore and language definitely puts it out of the range of kids under 18 and offends the eyes and ears of many adults.  I didn't &#34;choose wisely&#34; on this one.  The casual frequent use of the F*** word in a traditional childrens' fairy tale seems diabolically distasteful.
159315724X|5.0|Incredible book, I've read this a coupel times, its simple, short, straightforward, and a grabbing read. Changed my perspective on my daily actions and deciisons, highly recommend!
B008602KQI|5.0|One of the most excellent movie that a watch.<br />The actors are great.<br />I love the storyline.<br />I am expected the next movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app. No problems out ads in the way. I would recommend this to all horse lovers
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Is this move bound for the Oscars. We'll no. What this movie is is fun from start to finish. This movie is a campy spoof adventure set in the middle ages with Gatling guns and witches and milk bottles with missing children posted on them. One spoiler, there is one scene with nudity.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Ryan produced this film herself and really made it something special. Also Kline's French accent was so good I forgot he was American within the first few moments he was on screen. Ryan isn't afraid to be silly (but in a good way) and shows in the end what a heart of gold she 's got. Visit Paris and the French countryside during this movie and watch the fun begin with the cat and mouse chase between these two stars. You'll laugh and dream at the same time...
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This is absolutely an amazing soundtrack.  If you like Hans Zimmer, this is a definite must own!  Tracks 8 & 17 are my favorites so far.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Thrilling game!! It kept me curious and thinking the entire time. The ending was especially good. I'd love to play a sequel.
0857208748|5.0|UPDATE:<br /><br />Sadly I have just learned of the passing of one of our finest authors, Vince Flynn; thus, The Last Man will be his last book.<br /><br />  RIP<br />  VINCE FLYNN<br /><br />As a devoted Vince Flynn reader, I will admit to a bias; however, I believe it is fair to say that Flynn never disappoints.  I suppose that a new reader, who had not read any of the preceding books featuring Mitch Rapp as the lead character, might not relate as well as those of us who thoroughly understand how Rapp has developed into the \\"super-agent\\" he is, Last Man still would be a very readable and enjoyable book on its own merit.  I will note, for those who are familiar with the Mitch Rapp persona, this is the most restrained Rapp we have seen thus far - but, fear not, Mitch is no shrinking violet!
B002APU580|5.0|My friend recommended this movie--\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Keira Knightley--and I watched it twice that evening! My heart soared toward the end of the film as Darcy and Elizabeth make their way toward each other.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|My rational rider will no longer struggle with an emotional elephant as the path is made clear in both it's direction and measurable expectation. I loved the idea of making the path easy.
B00874T02K|4.0|I agree with atomic Bob, this app does great atvwhatbot says it does. However, could be better with some guidance on form and coaching o  routine.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|A different spin on the zombie genre. A good flick for a feel good summer. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Don't expect this to be a life story of Lincoln. It only encompasses the period of time it took to get the 13 amendment passed. This being said, the movie is very well acted and you learn so much about the political dealings that had to be done to get the necessary passing vote in the house of representatives. The senate had passed it 2 years before. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Lincoln to perfection. When he tells funny stories to the other people, you wish he would tell more. All  of the other actors play off each other so well that you can imagine yourself sitting there with them.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Seriously, it consumed my life for 3 weeks. Can't wait to read the next one. So beautifully written, I felt like I was there.

B00ADS98FC|5.0|I'm really glad we gave this movie a chance. It's become an instant favorite for our family(teenagers of course) and definitely a movie you can watch more than once!
B000654OUG|5.0|A piano cannot produce a &#34;tone,&#34; as can a violin, nor is there any difference in &#34;touch&#34; as it's a percussive instrument, so how can one be so much in love with Ms. Uchida's tone, touch, and sympathetic interpretations of these pieces?  She rightly thanks her producer, who no doubt had much to say about the final sound, but in truth, this is just a glorious Schubertiade.  Alas, what's missing is the Wanderer Fantasy.  I hope that we will not have to wait long for that.

0440246008|5.0|The Hard Way by Lee Child<br /><br />Jack Reacher ends up working with an ex-FBI agent in this book.  A mercenary leader's wife has disappeared and all his hard core special force types are useless to him until Reacher finds the perp.<br /><br />Child has a very vivid imagination.  He comes up with some amazingly despicable people.  Some of this book was hard to read but fits perfectly with Reacher's style of justice.<br /><br />You can't really describe Jack Reacher as a hard man with a soft heart because the soft spots on his heart are not readily accessible.  He is a hard man with an overdeveloped sense of justice,  perhaps not legally acceptable justice but justice never the less.<br /><br />As in all the Jack Reacher books I have read so far, there is non-stop action and lots of violence.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I recommend the book.<br /><br />Web Site: http://www.leechild.com/

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I do not recommend you buy this if you're expecting the same quality you found in the Band of Brothers. Truth is, there is no quality to be found in any of this. Hours of confusion because you never get an opportunity to actually know who the heck they're talking about. There's  just no good to talk about. Rent it or borrrow it before you waste YOUR money, too. Spielberg and Hanks owe us an apology.

B009AMAGXK|5.0|Let me preface this with the fact that I have only read this book in what was a three book series.  There are some fairly significant changes between the book and the movie but I believe for the most part that the bring about a better pace and cadence to the movie.  The book seemed to lag in places and where there were what I guess we're supposed to be big reveals, I just didn't find them that exciting.  I also felt the movie's ending made much more sense.<br /><br />Overall, the movie itself was excellent with a good plotline, strong character and acting, and a well thought out ending.  I just wish it had been more popular so there would be a sequel.  I mean, Twilight was horribly acted and it still got a sequel.  Oh we'll, I'd still recommend this movie (and even the book as I'm gearing up to read the second in the series).

B008JFUPK8|5.0|After a mediocre Iron Man 3 and a good-but-not-great Star Trek: Into Darkness - both films being nothing more than entertaining roller coaster rides, which is fine for some viewers but not for me - Man Of Steel delivers, not just the requisite ride, which is expected of all summer blockbuster movies, but a good story and a Christian message to boot. Henry Cavill (Immortals, The Tudors) gives us a version of Superman that is naturalistic and emotional, as opposed to Christopher Reeves' take from the 1980s that was stiff and two-dimensional. With the script, David S. Goyer (Batman Begins, Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises) introduces us to a darkly realistic Superman: one full of introspection and doubts, full of past hurts and pain, and yet determinedly hopeful.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises) started production on the film, and then turned it over to Zack Snyder (300) to direct. I had my doubts about this triumvirate - Nolan-Snyder-Goyer - simply because Superman is not Batman, and these guys had Batman in their blood. (300 has that same \\"Dark Knight\\" kind of feel.) DC Comics' Superman is a character very much like Marvel Comics' Captain America - you could almost add him to the list of baseball, hot dogs and Mom's apple pie. He's all-American and he's uncomplicated. Batman, on the other hand, is darkly complex, a psychological roadmap of twists and turns. I was afraid they would turn this simple, refreshing character into a Dark Knight clone.<br /><br />But, delightedly, they did not. What they did do, surprisingly, is give us Superman as a Christ figure - the Son of Man as the Man of Steel. Man Of Steel is fraught with Christian symbols. Where this came from, I do not know, because, while there is a lot of spirituality in comics and graphic novels - and much of it Christian - I don't think it's this blatant. I know that Superman is the most righteous of all the superheroes - again, like Captain America, who is also full of virtue and a model for boys to follow. But to think of him as a Christ figure is to take him to a new level. Yet, there it is, throughout the film: Superman is Christ. Substitute Superman's muscles for Christ's spirit, Kansas for Galilee and Metropolis for Jerusalem and you have, in essence, the same story - the salvation of mankind by a dual-nature being - fully God and fully man.<br /><br />Superman is a savior. The first thing that tipped me off was the scene where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife are putting the baby Kal-El into a spaceship destined for Earth in order to save him from the destruction of the planet Krypton. I thought, \\"That is Moses being placed in the reed basket and sent down the River Nile.\\" Think about it. He's being sent away from destruction to a people with which he has nothing in common in order to save them. That was not only the calling of Moses, it was the calling of Christ. Notice that both Kal-El's name, and that of his father Jor-El, end in El. El in Hebrew means God. I doubt if that was an accident.<br /><br />Like Jesus, Kal-El (Clark) was raised by an adopted father - in his case, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner). Kent instills in his son the idea of always being a force for good, and of always doing the right thing. He warns Clark that people may not accept him, and that they'll probably be afraid of him because of his powers; and so he needs to keep his identity a secret. This is not unlike Christ's warning to his disciples not to make His identity known.<br /><br />Superman begins his \\"career\\" of saving people at the age of 30. So did Jesus. He begins as an itinerant worker. Jesus began as an itinerant preacher. Both men did so, partly to conceal their identities, and partly to avoid their enemies.<br /><br />Superman discovers his origins and purpose from his father's facsimile in an arctic outpost. Moses did the same thing from a burning bush, and it could be argued that Jesus discovered these things during his 40 days and40 nights in the wilderness. Such a\\"briefing\\" could be said to be a rite of passage - a spiritual rite of passage. Every believer, and every great character in literature and film, has one. It is what defines them. Superman is such a character.<br /><br />I really like the fact that the story of Superman has a \\"grunge\\" phase, which is what his time as an itinerant worker is. It makes his story more real. I also like how the filmmakers tell his backstory using flashbacks. It's far more effective than if they had just told a straight chronological story, because it relates those events to his present sufferings. When Clark finally becomes Superman, he's spectacular, as you would imagine. He's got the hair, the muscles and the cape. But he has more than that. One of the things we discover in his conversations with Lois Lane is the meaning of the \\"S\\" on his chest: it isn't an \\"S\\" for Superman; rather, it's the symbol for hope on the planet Krypton. Superman represents hope. That's what Christ represents as well.<br /><br />As Superman, Henry Cavill has it over Christopher Reeve hands down. Not only is he more comfortable with his muscles - Reeve was stiff and bulky - but he's a far better actor. He has some very emotional scenes, and is very believable in them. His relationship with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) works well, as far as chemistry. In the analogy with Christ, we are Lois Lane - the one he loves, the one he saves time and time again, the one he would die for. The best part of Clark Kent is his struggle with himself - his attempt to reconcile his two natures - and thereby decide where his allegiances lie - with the remnant of Krypton, who are basically the bad guys; or with residents of his new home, Earth. Of course, he chooses the latter.<br /><br />Trust is a prime motif in Man Of Steel. I already mentioned Clark's father's advice about not trusting people with his identity. In one scene, Clark is in a church, seeking answers to the question of who he is and what he should be. As he's leaving, the pastor, in a desperate attempt to help, blurts out something to the effect of, \\"Trust people.\\" Later, when Superman is finally recognized by Colonel Nathan Hardy (Christopher Meloni) as a friend, not an enemy, he says something to the effect of, \\"I trust you.\\" Trust is the foundation in any relationship, and certainly with both the Man of Steel and the Son of Man.<br /><br />In Man Of Steel, there's the obligatory violence, as Superman fights against the bad guys - the only other survivors from the destroyed planet Krypton, who are traitors, exiled from the planet for insurrection. The leader of this group, General Zod (Michael Shanno), is not my favorite villain of all time. There is nothing compelling about him. And the final showdown with Superman is over-kill, in my opinion. It would have been just as effective - and the movie could have been brought in at 2 hours run time instead of 2:23 - by having him die with his compatriots. Must every action-adventure movie end with a final showdown? In this case, I don't think it was needed.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is the last one. I won't be giving anything away if I say that it is when Clark Kent shows up at the Daily Planet for the first time wearing his glasses, obviously promising a sequel. I thought, \\"Now that is Clark Kent.\\" At last: an actor who can pull off both Superman and Clark Kent without one of them seeming ridiculous. Bravo!<br /><br />Final Note: I've mentioned before how Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan is a cultural Christ figure (http://www.waitsel.com/classic_literature/Tarzan.html). Well, so is Superman. As such, I think he's also a symbol of Righteousness (http://www.christianknighthood.com/Righteousness.html). Both of these characters came out of the early part of the 20th Century, reflecting the values of Americans at that time. Can we recapture those? We need to, and this film definitely gives promise to that hope.40 nights in the wilderness. Such a\\"briefing\\" could be said to be a rite of passage - a spiritual rite of passage.

B00B81B0HC|5.0|I loved this album from start to finish. It had great production and the music was transcendent of its time.
B002JIEYKS|5.0|This album has been pretty much dragged through the muck in the media, and that is a shame. Ozzy and Tony have dissed Never Say Die quite often over the years and personally, I have to wonder if their memory of this album is blurred with the previous album. After the debacle surrounding the enormous big business that is &#34;13&#34; (and Bill Ward's sad absence), I honestly believe that a lot of what comes out of their mouths is scripted from the boardroom. Never Say Die was written and recorded (supposedly) under duress, and in very substandard conditions: writing during the day in a cold theater in Toronto in January and then recording at night. If this is truly the case, that's all the more reason that this album is a ton of diamonds - especially compared to the cocaine freakfest of Technical Ecstasy, an album made by a band where truly the right hand didn't have a clue what the left hand was doing. Not that TE doesn't have it's moments (&#34;All Moving Parts (Stand Still)&#34;, &#34;You Won't Change Me&#34;). But this is about NSD, so back to that. We start off with the title track roaring out of the gate: an up-tempo MAJOR KEY song (who would've figured) with a nice mellow-ish bridge ala Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Then we have &#34;Johnny Blade&#34;, which takes up where SBS's &#34;Who Are You&#34; left off. Listen to Ozzy sing &#34;Well you know that Johnny's a spider, and his web is the city at night&#34; - it's one of the man's best deliveries of his career! Up next is &#34;Junior's Eyes&#34;, truly one of the band's most under-rated songs ever. Geezer's bass is spectacular, and if the chorus doesn't move you, you might want to check to see if you have a pulse. Tony's work is superior on this song as well, with hints of what would come stylistically on Heaven & Hell and Mob Rules. I tend to skip over the drunken &#34;Hard Road&#34;. Side 2 starts off with &#34;Shockwave&#34;, a classic riff from Tony & some great chord changes in the chorus. &#34;Shockwave&#34; would've benefited significantly had the doo-wop-ish &#34;ooh ooh&#34;'s toward the end been discarded. Now we come to an absolute perfect gem of a song: &#34;Air Dance&#34;, Sabbath's most elegant song - starting off with a multi-tracked guitar riff (perhaps Tony had been hanging out with his friend Brian May?) that should be considered one of THE great Sabbath riffs, followed by a mellow chorus that sounds like a beautifully refined Vol 4 moment. There's a gorgeous middle section with a perfect guitar solo reminiscent of &#34;Planet Caravan&#34;. The song then kicks into a classy up-tempo jam (nice work from percussion artiste extraordinaire Bill Ward) that takes it to the end. Air Dance defines the creative genius of this band and all four members shine brilliantly. Next is &#34;Over To You&#34;, another sadly overlooked gem that could've come off any of their post-Master Of Reality albums. Strong work from Tony and Ozzy. A great melodic, heavy, almost-funky-at-times masterpiece. Now we take a left turn with &#34;Breakout&#34; - a proto metal jazz instrumental piece (complete with horn section) that reasonably should not work - but it is so bizarre that it pulls off brilliantly! Doom Jazz. Who else has done that? (Let us not forget that Black Sabbath's mission statement from its inception was to be somewhat bizarre by the standards of its time.) The album ends with the filler track &#34;Swinging The Chain&#34;. No offense whatsoever to Bill on lead vocals, but this song sounds like a leftover from Technical Ecstasy. So, in conclusion, just for the tracks &#34;Junior's Eyes&#34; and &#34;Air Dance&#34;, this album is essential. Especially if you've had about enough of hearing &#34;Iron Man&#34; for gazillionth time. This album succeeds much like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath did, although SBS was more cohesive as a whole. But for experimentation, songwriting and execution in the unlikeliest of situations, Never Say Die hopefully in time will take its proper place amongSabbath's finest moments. That is this listener's opinion, and it's worth what you paid for it. Thank you Amazon for the opportunity to do my part in setting the story straight on an album that is an artistic triumph which has very sadly been maligned in legend.<br />UPDATE, AUGUST 2016 - THE NEW REMASTER OF THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!!! I puchased the new editions of Vol 4 and Never Say Die, and I'm like WTH - the remaster for Vol 4 is worse than the Black Box version, whereas NSD is freaking FANTASTIC!!!Sabbath's finest moments.

B00C7JGDBW|2.0|First of all the acting stunk to high heaven, and the costumes were ridiculous. However, there was a lot of potential concerning the story. Disney had combined the MGM 1939 movie version, the original story, and their own twist to this updated OZ film. In the original story (WHAT I remember) Dorothy and her friends came across a town made of porcellin/china. One china lady was worried about Dorothy and her friends causing her to fall/crack. In this movie version Disney had added the china town into the story.<br />Also, in the 1939 OZ movie, and in the original story book, the man known as Oz was in fact a sneaky manipulative person, and his personality remained the same in this updated film. For example, in the original story Oz forced people to wear green colored glass before entering the emerald city...the glasses made the city look green.<br />Disney also created sets/background that resembled the 1939 MGM oz movie. Watch the original movie, and this remake...pay close attention during the Oz chamber scenes, the haunted forest, and the costumes on the munchkins. You can tell that Disney spoofed/paid tribute to the original film's style/flavor.<br /> Even the wicked witch's costume(in this movie version) resembled one of the earlier costume designs in the 1939 oz movie. Originally, MGM was going to make the wicked witch sexy(MGM originally planned to mimic \\"Snow White's\\" Wicked Queen's attire) and they had created a tight fitting black dress, hat, and hood that looks very similar to the witch in this movie version. Also, how the witch couldn't touch water was from the original story, MGM's movie version, and it was in this movie version as well (when the witch cried the tears dissolved parts of her face).<br />The blending of the original story, MGM's movie version, and Disney's story telling for their OZ movie really paid off well. However, what killed the movie was the acting, costumes, and the strange reactions/dialog in different scenes.<br />The worst part about the film was the beginning...it felt as if I were watching a high school play with too long of scenes, dialog, and bad acting.<br />I was never a big fan of the original 1939 oz movie, and I'm certainly not a fan of this one. However, if you want your children entertained for two hours while you do other things, then this movie should work... I wish Tim Burton would have directed this movie...Disney would have had a classic on their hands right now.
B0058VW36U|5.0|everyone loves the challenges and graphics on this, great Family game for ages 8 to 80. We have two different versions and none have grown tiring yet.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Wow! Hans Zimmer really gets the best and worst out of people!! I guess it says something about his importance in the film scoring universe. To me, he's the best. A true master. A teacher. The students that come out of his film school (Remote Control) are less memorable to me. Guilty pleasures at the most. But him...<br /><br />Mr. Zimmer's work on \\"The Man Of Steel\\" stands at another level of film scoring, in my humble opinion. A bit like the excellent work of John Williams on \\"The Adventures Of Tintin\\". It's not what you might have expected but it is what it is. These composers are at a level where you pretty much accept whatever they come up with. Some other composers, I might feel like they missed it. But with Zimmer, Williams and few others (Elfman, Newton-Howard, etc...), I feel obligated to respect their choices.  If that's what they think the music should be, well then, that's what it should be. For example, I will not argue with Mr. Zimmer's choice on the next Lone Ranger score. It will be fitting, I'm sure.<br /><br />The film itself (\\"Man Of Steel\\") was disappointing to me. A lot of good things and a couple of bad ones. But the music wasn't part of what I didn't like. I had a chance to listen to it a lot before the film actually came out. And I enjoyed it pretty much. It wasn't what I was expecting. Well, yes it was a bit because of Mr. Zimmer's usual sound and motifs. But still, I was also, like others, expecting a fanfare-like theme. I wanted something easy to whistle. This score is the kind you need to listen along with the film itself. It works darn well. There is a lot of emotion. Without the movie, though, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. Unless you're an absolute fan of Hans Zimmer. Unless you have fun simply trying to recognize his usual themes and habits. Which I do. Track 1, 6, 11, 16 and 17, for example, are simply mesmerizing, even without the movie playing along. And the sound and rhythm of the drums are so adequate and epic-like!<br /><br />But yes, I can understand how some people can be disappointed with it. So I don't recommend it to anyone who isn't a true lover of film music or a true fan Of Hans Zimmer. Someone who's expecting a John Williams-like score, something easy to hum, don't bother. But if you're willing to go on a voyage with Mr. Zimmer's melodies and if you're willing to let them grow on you, this soundtrack is for you. You will be rewarded, I think.<br /><br />Mr. Zimmer, I'm with you. Always. In terms of what a movie needs, I trust you blindly.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|Never worked on my new tablet so now everything ive purchase is gone. What a let down. Stick to real books thats what I say
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So glad I didn't buy this book--I checked it out at the library instead.  The story is no further along than at the end of the second book.  Same insecurities and jealousies.  I honestly think the writer made a list of sexual positions and then wrote a story around each one for each chapter.  Sure the sex was hot, but there was no real story.  So Gideon did some things to her and she did some surprising things to him in the bedroom, but they don't know or trust each other any more than the first book--maybe less.  The only suspense in the book is wondering when one of the two is going to finally really cheat on the other.  Every character in the book is weak and has serious issues.  I felt like this book was a free e-book where they tease you with a partial story to get you to buy the next one.  Sadly, this one had to be paid for also.  I think when I read Bared To You, it was released as a trilogy, so you would think everything would be wrapped up in this third book.  Instead, the cover of this one says it's a SERIES, and it ends and then the author tells you obviously the story isn't over meaning so wait another year and buy the next one. They're never going to live happily ever after or go their separate ways, she's going to keep torturing everyone with more sexual positions.  UGH!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I hadn't seen &#34;Harold and Maude&#34; in at least twenty years.  Watching i brought back great memories of that time.  The movie is flawess.  Ruth Gordon is a gem and Bud Cort brought a great blend of innocence and dementia to the role.  Anyone with whom I've ever watched it loved it as well.  It's referred to as a cult film, but I think it as a farther reach than that.
B008476HBM|5.0|This was a hard read in many ways but to reach such an end a as this book has is wonderful.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I have played modern combat 4 , nova 3 , future ops and lots other first person shooters but this game is beast and addicting I can't stop playing get it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|How Gillian Flynn was able to construct this story line left me wondering for ages. I could not believe the premeditated deception that unravelled in this 'couldn't put down' novel. I loved her modern, snappy style of the writing and all the cooky characters that emerged as the story was told. Great fun to read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using pinterest to help plan for parties and weddings, ext.  I'm on it all the time, id recommend it to everyone.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Fun new spin on the Zombie story.  Less gross (but still a little) than the norm for the genre, but funny, sweet, and very entertaining.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001CP4VNE|4.0|great as good as first Batman if not darker penguin was more of psycho then joker and catwoman was scary and sexy
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story from beginning to end. Highly recommended for every sci-fi fan!  One of the best books I've read in awhile.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|It was a good send off movie for Bruce Willis. Lots of action and a pretty good plot. Over all a good movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I give. It a 5 it's wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than temple run but all the cliches and stuff is not the app fault it's amazon and how things ate set up  if you have a problem with kindle got get an iPod or iPhone or iPad
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family to sit and enjoy together. My boys especially enjoyed it. I purchased this over my kindle then pulled it up on our smart TV for everyone to enjoy it on a much larger screen. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to look through the movies, watch trailers, and order from the kindle fire HD.
B001CTDH58|4.0|I thought this movie would be dumb, but it honestly was very cute and great for children who love animals.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I like this game. and I would recommend it I think you would like it<br />I like almost ever gameloft&reg; games and this one is cool so check it out
B0086700CM|4.0|its a great game though it lags a little. very addictive and fun. I recommend it. my eyes get tired playing this so try it with low light on your device
B000JMKQX0|4.0|What I was hoping for in reading this book was a compelling story detailing the fight against zombies. What I didn't realize however was that this book is purely composed of a collection of individual interviews varying from a few pages to 15-20 each. The stories are random and don't really weave into one another. Also THIS DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE MOVIE. Unlike the movie the zombies are slow moving and there are no main characters or story line. Besides all this World War Z was an interesting and entertaining read, providing some cool military and civilian accounts with the zombie invasion.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I enjoy this very much. Great game play good job to the creator.  It's a very addicting game I can't to seem to stop playing
B009XIXVU6|4.0|If you have not read any of Hosseini's books, read this one first.  It is beautiful but has a much more complex list of characters than do the other two I have read, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Wrap your head around this one, and then relax a bit when reading the other two.  No matter the order in which you approach Hosseini's books, each one will provide you with a deeply satisfying reading experience.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Every American should know this story and the sacrifices of all the American solders that risk their lives to protect us.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Usually we get something that sounds so new that are minds are blown, but its sounds like a continuation of \\"Cruel Summer\\" which is not a bad thing but its more of the same and I am not use to that from Yeezus
B0077EBWVI|4.0|This was a great movie. I connected with many parts of it especially since I have lived in a small southern town before and go to church. I'm not a great dancer, but I really enjoyed seeing how Ren, Willard, Ariel, and the Reverend changed throughout the movie and how they changed the town. I can't go into details without giving away parts of the movie but I highly recommend it!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|If you always have internet access when you will be using it, it works just fine.  Without internet access, not so much.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is like gta I like a lot but you need to add police come at you with Helios add a zombie mode so you have to survive from zombies also add fighter jets like f14 to cats
0385344228|4.0|Nature or nurture?  What rules?  What do you believe?  Can you always make excuses for your \\"different\\" child?  How do you find the truth?
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book lives up to the hype. It has a complex and engaging storyline in a fantasy world that feels like real.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Still getting used to how to use it best.  Lots of sounds to pick from.  Allows you to mix sounds to create your own unique blend.
B0089LOG02|4.0|A great summer read! Based on historical data, this book draws you into a bygone era  which history has overlooked. Christina Baker Kline brings the story of two women decades apart, to better reconcile their lives. through each of their life journeys and though strangers at first, they come together to find  understanding and strength from one another. I would this book  to high school students to adults.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a really fun game to play. It is a good game for free. I would enjoy more games like it.
1594484805|5.0|Great read with interesting facts, smart analyses, synthesis and humor too! (And nine more words of prase to comply to the system)
B004GYY714|5.0|I've had the most fun just exploring all the stations.  There are so many from all over the world.  Over the air as well as lots of internet only stations.  If you like anything radio; music, talk, discussion, or just listening to evening drive time radio in London, you've got to give this app a try.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is just a good time all around.  I have watched it many times and still like it. The middle drags a bit and it is quite formulaic, but still great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and keeps my mind occupied could use some hints and instructions but over all pretty good. also it was too short
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I did the research and a similar bag ran no less than $75 at Best Buy and similar stores. At $30, this is an awesome deal. And the bag itself is not cheaply. It is well constructed, wears and looks very nice. I feel like I cheated someone with purchase. I would absolutely recommend this bag.
0684857219|5.0|Good insight from Arnold on nutrition.I haven't finished the book yet but so far its an easy read. Solid info from his experience.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. It was obviously for kids, therefore there was some cheesiness. However, I found it very entertaining.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It's a classic look and the stretch band holds the case securely closed when not in use. I can set it up on my desk to play games in either horizontal or vertical mode without having to hold it all the time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome! It got me on some of the levels but it was fun and worth it. I would really recommend this to everyone who likes hidden object games and trying to find clues. This is the best game ever!!!
B00BK3MSME|5.0|If you like Madeleine Peyroux, then you need this album.  She does covers in her own inimitable style.  So much better than her previous album of originals.  I love it!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|It's decently written, reminded me of a mix of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander books, as well as the Twilight Series and even a bit of His Dark Materiels.  I mean REALLY reminded me of them.  The vampires are relatively pleasant and the witches are not so bad (except the killer ones.)  Everyone seems very alternate universe, which I think is the point.  I read this and the sequel.  The sequel was like if Diana Gabaldon and Karleen Koen had a baby with a vampire.  This is not horrible stuff, but I thought it would be better due to the reviews.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just like the the title I was entwined with the book. Majorly upset that I got to the end only to discover questions not answered & secrets still hidden. Why..2 more books coming, the next not until December which I didn't realize until I got to the last page thinking I skipped some. I started the series content finding parallels to 50 shades. .now that the story has its own legs im left breathless for more. Gideon & Eva can't go a day without each other & you want me to wait 6 months. Now I'm feeling their pain
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I didn't even know who Emeli Sande was before I heard a song form this album by complete mistake, and now I am a fan for life. This is by far one of the best albums I have heard all year and probably for years. Her voice, the lyrical content, the music, everything is beautiful, on point, and amazing. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Consequently, the spiritual journey she seems to have been going through in this album are the same I was taking on my second novel Gardens and the Warrior of Heaven. So it is a great thing that we are so synonymous creatively and this was great listening as it was like reliving my own experience, not to mention it's nice that on this journey called life someone else is walking a similar path. I recommend this CD to anyone, you should be so honored. Can't wait to see what she comes out with next.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|For all of you facing the white screen issue, I`d like to say that I overcame it by placing my kindle upright. By doing so, the white screen disappeared and it was replaced by the &quot;connect now&quot; screen.<br />Good luck.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I was reminded of Patrick Rothfuss.  Between Anthony Ryan and Patrick, I need my epic stories about cool dudes!  Feels like a great series waiting to happen.<br /><br />Vaelin's story is part magic, part mystery, and part sacrifice.  He's been abandoned by his father at the gate of the 6th Order, and he has to decide right then as a little kid to become a brother of the 6th order.  There are 6 orders (well, so we are told.)  These orders have different ideas about the world and who is supposed to be in it.<br /><br />It's got a bit of the wonder of Game of Thrones, where there are so many people vying for power and so many different religious ideas and magical critters sparkling in time.<br /><br />Yes, it's a Harry Potter for adults, but bloodier and less magical.  There's a creepy story about a witch that you have to pay attention to, and there are misbegotten wars happening all over the place (when are they not?)
0425263916|5.0|I laughed, cried and was sick to my stomach at parts when evidence was building. The book grew more legs than book one and I am still enjoying the series. I was eager to get to the third book until I read the last few pages of this one, as it summed up most of the story. I will read book 3 in case new twists occur and I assume the summery of Eva and Gideon's future, but by now I can guess most of it. I hope I'm wrong
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Love this soundtrack! Thank you Hans Zimmer for giving us this soundtrack. It reminds me a lot Inception and Pirates.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|This was a very underwhelming movie. I will not be watching it again. Very disappointing movie to say the least.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really loved this and think I'll read it to my oldest daughter when she hits around 9 years of age.  It's fascinating, and explores ideas like genetic manipulation and anti-gravity/life in space, as well as bigger concepts like universal peace.  I won't spoil the end of Ender's game, but you can see it coming a mile away.  Definitely a win for sci fi youth fiction, would be a great introduction (better than The Giver, which I hear is a 5th grade reading list book.)
0425263908|4.0|I really want to give this 5 stars bc it captured my attention & I couldn't put it down. The reason for the 4 is bc there were many parallel themes to 50 shades. Rich man working in the same office, erotic scenes, unknown bonds with women in the shadow of the relationship, mysterious family issues etc. It's as if both authors wrote them in the same room, but looked out 2 different windows. I enjoyed it & can't wait to start the next one despite the similarities. If you read 50, you will want to read this series
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Grate game for all ages. Keeps your hand and mind running. Improves hand and eye coordination. A must have if your into a fast pace game.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Good violin CD arrangements. Very entertaining and very talented artist. Must like this kind of music to enjoy the CD. Overall is Good.
0061906220|5.0|She sings her own version of the song, and we downloaded the story and song on the computer.  kid loves it.  I'm going to buy books from the series and keep it on my toddler short list for good birthday presents.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This writer is brilliant.  His education as a physician is evident, but he keeps on getting better and better as a writer, too. Loved this novel.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Let me start by saying that The Name of the Wind is one of the best fantasy books I've ready in years. I fell in love with the story and the characters, but more I love the author's style. He has a great talent for creating humor, suspense, and situations that have you at the edge of your seat. Happily this style continued in Wise Man's Fear, though the story was not as gripping.<br /><br />Spoilers below!<br />Several times throughout the book I found myself wanting the story to get on with it. The sub plots were interesting, and I'm glad they were there, but they went on too long. The hunt for the bandits and the group dynamics involved were very good, but drug out forever.  The interlude in the fae was interesting but seemed to stall out and coast. Also, other than learning to do the deed, fight, and obtain disposable income, Kvothe didn't actually seem to gain much. Nor did we find out much about the Chandrian.<br />Spoilers End!<br /><br />Overall, I thought the book was well worth it, as mainly was the writing was wonderful, if not the story. This felt much more like someone telling a piece of an epic tale on the scale of WOT rather than the middle of a trilogy, for which I think this was intended. As I'm happy to read a several book series rather than a trilogy, this works for me!
B00C33M2EE|4.0|Prefer the Piano Guys 1 though but still nice. Would like them to make more CDs. Also make oldies music too.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is a prequel to &#34;The Hit&#34;. It is gripping with a plot that twists and turns. If you like thrillers, you will love this.
1455113549|5.0|I can't believe how many people I have told about this book.  The subject matter is fascinating for anyone who has ever had to defend a child on any matter and then had second thoughts.
0756405890|5.0|It is very refreshing to come across a book like this. Extremely good writing, gripping story, compelling characters. Rothfuss has a great ability to keep you on the edge of the seat. I laughed, cried, and was sorry when it was over. Highly recommended!
B00004STPT|5.0|One of the nicest soundtracks CDs in the market. Play it in a big living room and enjoy the music,
B004IYISSK|5.0|Basically read it all in one day. Wanted to read it with my daughter, (we started to read at the same time) but I could not put it down.  Cool thing is that having read it as an e book, we can still interact with the text through highlighted passages and notes.  My daughter has to read this as a school requirement over the summer; I remember the movie and thought it would be enjoyable to read with her.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was psychologically fascinating, but the ending was not consistent with the rest of the novel.  Otherwise I would've given it 4 stars.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love the variety of toplcs you can get on this app. So very helpful.  I am looking forward to all that I can learn.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Lets just say, if you love Stardust, you will love this album. Willie does some great classics from his childhood. Great album, but I'm not a huge Stardust fan, however I recognize the brilliance in it.
B004I9CR5K|2.0|Great music, but the US pressing (United Records Pressing) is really low quality with very intrusive background noise, \\"pop\\" sounds and crackle during playback... visually several marks and small scratches are visible under strong light, these help explain the noise issues but it is also caused by poor quality control at the factory :( Amazon.com offers a refund upon return but with the return shipping cost being so high it makes it really not a valid option... Amazon should provide other solutions for these cases where products are deffective and return shipping cost is very high (or almost as high as the item cost)
B0072NWJRK|4.0|Very interesting, factual bit of history, I thought.  Characters well-drawn. Picture of that time.  An odd story well told.  I liked it!
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles are fun and I like that you can increase the difficulty by having more pieces. However, it would be nice to have more scenic puzzles or even something other than babies and cats.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary is cliffhanging, smart and intellectual shows on CBS last season the finale was worth watching this program. Who is Moriarty? Watch Elementary Season 1 to find out!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome its as good as temple run and the update has tons of stuff from temple run[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)<br />One word AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't love the book. It started very slow. By the end I was into it but not one of my faves
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game! I am addicted! My mother in law had it on her kindle and I started playing it.  The moment I got home I downloaded it and play all the time.
B0011E9LBI|4.0|I love this movie. What a good team they make. My son and daughter requested this movie and i can not help but watch it again witht them. Just good family fun.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|We had a good time watching as a family.  There is a little bit of a shower scene which is suggestive, but not explicit.  Looking forward to Part II!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Well written. The book series draws you in and keeps you wanting to know what is happening to &#34;your&#34; favorite people!!
0756405890|5.0|Patrick rothfuss is easily my favorite new author! this guy's work is going to push the fantasy genre into the literature isle of your local bookstore.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Favorite video of my youngest. My oldest had Nemo and they have Rio. I have seen it way to many times. LOL
B002RVCD6O|5.0|No surprises here. As my youngest kids came of age to watch the Harry Potter series, they enjoyed them all; but, felt that this movie is a particular favorite in the series.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I read this book in one sitting.  I enjoyed it.  I was shocked by Pat memory.  I hope things work out for Pat and Tiffany.  3 stars
B00BXLU1EU|4.0|This app is awesome.no problems, fast, and free.I would definitely recommend this for anyone.I am just not sure if they can see you on using their wifi.
159463176X|3.0|After the in depth feelings and emotions of Khaled's last two books, which transported me to being there, to feeling the characters pain, love etc an experience that gave me an understanding of Afghanistan her people and the conflicts. His latest novel And the Mountains Echoed didn't have the depth that I appreciated in his other two books, for me I found it missing &#34;real people&#34; they all seemed rather stiff and the story had to keep being pushed to its conclusion.
B005UG542S|5.0|Even though one assumed that Harry would triumph, there were enough twists to keep the end of the Harry Potter series intersting to the end.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|It was a Die Hard movie. It was delightfully lacking in dialogue and reasonable character motivation/development. The destruction wreaked on Moscow seemed unjustified given the circumstances, but then, it's Moscow and it's Die Hard. My roommate and I watched it on a Sunday afternoon, hung over and zoned out: we recommend everyone watch it that way.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Talk about hot sex & drama! I think this story was filled with it. Takes you on a rollercoaster journey of ups and downs of so many obstacles coming Gideon & Eva's way. From their exes, their families, to their individual pasts. At so many points I felt sorry for them. Sometimes it felt as if they couldn't catch a break. Whenever things started simmering down or seems to be going well, something else or someone else always popped up to stir things up again. But then again this makes for a very interesting read!<br /><br />I've read all the books in this series thus far, and I will say that \\"Entwined with You\\" is my favorite out of the series so far. One thing that I loved about this book is Gideon reveals his secrets. He's not as secretive and keeping things so close to the vest like he was in the other two books. He opens up more and fully lets Eva into his heart. I liked Gideon in Books 1 & 2. But I love him Book 3! I feel like they've both come a long way getting to realize each other's strengths, weaknesses or insecurities, etc... Only problem I had with him is I didn't like how he still feels some sort of obligation to Corinne. I didn't like that scene in the hospital towards the end and how he wanted Eva to leave. He lost some points there with me. And then let's not forget about him being a killer. Having killed Nathan leaves me feeling like I don't quite know how to feel about that. On one hand its almost endearing that he loves Eva that much to kill for her. On another its still like....well HELLO HE'S KILLED SOMEONE!<br /><br />The thing I continuously worried about through the entire book was wondering if Gideon would ever get caught and go to jail? That was my biggest fear! And everything the detective would show up questioning, always got me nervous! Lol<br /><br />The sex in here was extremely sexy. I think my favorite would be the Mile High scene when their on Gideon's private jet. You can feel the love, passion, and the intensity of their feelings just jumping off the pages. Descriptions were very vivid and it felt as if I was right there going through all the ups and downs they were experiencing myself.<br /><br />One thing I liked about Eva in this book too is I think she was stronger than ever. And knows herself more than ever. I liked seeing at times how she'd take control of situations. It felt like a breath of fresh air since Gideon seems to always be the main one in control of so many things.<br /><br />The reporter Deanna got on my last nerves! She was manipulative, sneaky, conniving and just an unlikable character all around. She was a total opportunist too. Along with Corinne. I never trusted Corinne as far as I could throw her. And when it's revealed towards the end of her pregnancy. I just about lost it jumping to conclusions thinking it was possibly Gideon's.<br /><br />I've always loved Cary. He's such a fun, sweet, life of the party to me kind of character. I was rooting for him to end up with Trey rather than Tatiana. I just feel Trey suits him better, and suits all of them better as a whole. With him becoming a father soon with Tatiana pregnant makes me think that's going to change Cary drastically. But I feel like it'll be a positive change and make him even more grounded knowing he has a child to set an example for. Eva's mother got on my nerves at times as well. But I think her intentions are good. Sometimes people can have good intentions but not execute them in the best way. I think Eva's dad was such a sweetheart. It was heartbreaking seeing how much it hurt him to find out about Eva's past. And with Gideon's parents I'm still a bit confused on why Gideon's mother seems to dislike Eva.<br /><br />Another character Brett, I liked him. He seems like a decent guy. But I thought he was a bit too pushy and wouldn't take no for an answer. I also kept wanting to shake Eva to be more assertive with him and not just agree to meet up feeling like she couldn't say no. That drove me crazy! I felt like it wasn't respectful to Gideon to meet up with an old flame. Even if she doesn't have feelings for Brett anymore. I thought it was playing with fire too close for comfort. And I just wanted her to not have any contact with Brett whatsoever.<br /><br />All in all I think this was a great book. I loved it! And I look forward to the next installment of Book 4 in the Crossfire Series by Sylvia Day.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|this story is lot of ethics in living, past , present, and future, jumping back and forth so fast that you have to be alert in keeping the plot for 3 stories. It ending was a surprise and happy. If you don't like si-fi, you might be completely lost. I liked it, but not as much as others that I have seen about the future. The language is &#34;muddy&#34;, and the actors don't have much facial expressions, so it could have been better, not so bland (for the &#34;future&#34;) in sections. Just my opinion as an older si-fi lover.
6305657947|4.0|This movie has romance, mystery, nice visuals and twist and turns that keep you guessing. One of the few movies that I enjoy watching more than once.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|pretty decent album tonys guitar work is amazing as always the radio hits i could do without but over all a good album
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|not dad at all and the best part it was free an its fun with building tanks and so on
B0011NVC98|5.0|I'm all about Beowulf just now, having read the poem, the graphic novel, and Grendel. As part of my study, I watched this film adaptation. What an excellent piece of art it is! It captures the setting and three main battles with a pacing that surpasses the original story.<br /><br />Yes, it takes liberties with the original storyline, which were interesting and a little annoying. Those I didn't like most were 1) conflating Aeschere and Unferth (or was Aeschere dropped completely?) and 2) having Wealtheow marry Beowulf. What I didn't like most was that Beowulf doesn't seem to have many redeeming qualities. In the original, I loved the guy in the way I would say King Arthur, but this Beowulf was too macho.<br /><br />Most importantly, the film still grapples with the central question of the poem: the meaning that bravery gives to a person's life on the one hand and the meaninglessness of most of the things for which people die on the other.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B009IUH1N2|3.0|The game is simply okay. I played it a couple times and it was fine but ever since, I kinda forgot about it. It did not leave me with any thrill or angst to play it again.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Such a good movie. It's timeless and I enjoyed seeing it again. I'm anxious to find the book and get the complete story.
B007NPLHUW|5.0|Leaves me wanting more. The characters are fun. Excellent storyline, never know whats going to happen but its always satisfying.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has reached a great level of achievement in this CD.  It is truly wonderful and to be enjoyed.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|I know that this is not supposed to be an amazing movie and I didn't have any expectations whatsoever watching this, but I think I laughed a total of maybe 3 times during the whole thing. It just wasn't my kind of comedy. The jokes were very flat and stupid and the story wasn't even enjoyable. Pretty big waste of time in my opinion so dont bother watching it unless you're a huge Sacha Baren Cohen fan. 1/5 for lack of laughs and a completely forgettable storyline.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|This album is incredible, I am Black Sabbath fan since 1972 ( I was 10 ) when I first heard Paranoid and War Pigs, well this album brings you back to that era of Sabbath, Rick Rubin does an amazing job of getting those sounds out of Geezer, Ozzy and of course the Riff Master Iommi. I'm not going to bore you with a Track By Track review, but I will say that some of my favorites are:<br />End of the Beginning<br />Zeitgeist<br />Damaged Soul<br />Dear Father and the Bone crushing Methademic!! ( the riff will rip your face off)<br />If your like me and wanted the beginnings of Sabbath sound than this is a \\"Must Have\\" one of the best albums of 2013<br />Ozzy sounds pretty damn good too for a guy who has been through the ringer. Iommi hasnt lost a step even with going through Chemo and all it's like the anger towards cancer is on the music.<br /><br />Long Live Black Sabbath!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie first, which was good, but this is way better.<br />I enjoyed how dramatic everything  was. I could feel his pain and sympathize with the others. I am happy with the ending. Enough to know the happily ever after, yet accepting there are troubles to come with their personalities.<br />Loves this one, fo' sho.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was awful. Poor acting; poor CGI; poor story conception.  I can't believe this was a Disney Production. I was disappointed I'd missed seeing it the theater; however, at this point, I'm glad I only spent  the $3.99 I paid to rent it at home. It was not worth the cost of a movie theater ticket.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Until I read this book, I had no idea who was Adam Brown or the kind of men that we call Navy Seals. This story also told of the impact on family, which we do not always read about. I was in awe, sadden and moved reading this book. If you want to read about a true American hero and the family that supported him, you have chosen the right book.<br />The last few chapters were read with tears and heart ache for his family.

B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I know I'm reading a great book when I wake at 5 am and and want to pick up the  book that I'm reading to see what happens next rather than go back to sleep.  This book really impressed me and I'm missing the characters now that I've finished it. There was a richness and depth to the main characters.  The book moved beautifully between characters, decades and emotions.  At no time did I suspect the ending and even when it began to fall in to place at the end I was still pleasantly surprised at how it all came together.  Can't wait for another Kate Morton book.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an impressive novel--it has all the elements of a good novel and executes on them well.  In terms of structure, I believe it actually has two complimentary dramatic structures which reach different audiences--one about survival and the other about love.  The two converge at the resolution and lead to a satisfying finish.<br /><br />For me, the survival story was what kept me reading.  But I can see some readers focusing more on the love story, especially if they're rooting for Peeta to get the girl.  However, for me, the love story never took off because Katniss never really fell for Peeta.  Nonetheless, the decision to have two separate story structures which overlap and come together in the end is a great technique.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|MY 17 inch laptop really fits in this bag - it is not tight and I dont have to struggle to get it zipped.

1609611543|4.0|If you want to know why there is a big gluten free craze, and why gluten is causing so many various health problems in America then the first 100 or so pages of this book are for you.  The author does a great job (better than anyone else I've seen) at explaining WHY wheat is causing problems and what happened to it over the past 50 years.<br /><br />The other point this book makes about gluten that is terrific, is that it goes well beyond celiac disease.  It is not just an intestinal problem, but rather gluten is causing multiple, various problems in people.  I myself had debilitating migraines(2 to 3/week), but have not had one since the day I went gluten free (over 4 years ago) unless I accidentally get exposed to gluten.<br /><br />The reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5, is that it lost its luster after the first 100 or so pages.  It deteriorates into a, \\"gluten free can cure this, and gluten free can cure that, and gluten free can cure this too, and gluten free can cure...\\"  While these chapters may be important if you suffer with that specific disease, I found it hard to get through all those chapters in a row when I basically got the idea from reading the chapter title.  I'm not doubting the truth in the gluten free claims.  In my own practice (I'm a doctor) I've seen gluten free diets help arthritis, thyroid conditions, depression/anxiety, ADD, headaches/migraines, and more.  I'm just saying reading about all of it gets a little long :).  If you have one of the specific diseases then read that chapter, but all of them together just got long and redundant for me.<br /><br />With that said the first 100 pages make this book well worth the investment of time and money.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King's novel about time travel, 11/22/63, has brought me back as a fan.  After reading [[ASIN:1476735476 Under the Dome: A Novel]], I wasn't sure I'd ever read a new King novel.  That one rambled in the middle and had a terrible ending.  This one, on the other hand, was much more focused and the ending was easier to pull off.<br /><br />The book is told first-person from the perspective of a school teacher who goes back in time in an attempt to stop the Kennedy assassination.  Fortunately, for dramatic purposes, the past doesn't want to be changed--the past being \\"obdurate\\" becomes a recurring theme--so the main character has many struggles along the way.  He also gets involved in the past and falls in love, further complicating the story.<br /><br />King's writing ability is in top form in this novel and he does a wonderful job of describing the late 50's and early 60's, both the good and the bad.  And we really get to know the main character and what drives his actions.  I think this is the big difference between 11/22/63 and Under the Dome; we care about the main characters in the former, but not in the latter.
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|These somewhat dark, wonderfully written and atmosphere-drenched Inspector Wallander books are a pure joy.  Literate, wry, sometimes quite funny and believable, the series gets better with every book - this is the 3rd I have read, and I plan on reading them all.  Not American style violent or dramatic, they seem very realistically to outline the work and life of a small town Swedish detective with all the normal family and moral issues of middle age.

1401222668|2.0|I don't normally read comic books, but The Watchmen was supposed to have a great plot so I took a chance on it.  Having finished it, now I'm thinking I missed the qualifier:  a great plot *for a comic book.*  The book started with an interesting mystery--who killed a former super hero--but then went on and on about other former super heroes and their lives.  There was a lot of filler in the middle and I didn't even know what the story was about until almost the end.  The conclusion did have a master plan with a villain, but it wasn't set up with the plot building up to it in steps.<br /><br />Even with a lot of back-story, I never cared much about any of the characters.  Perhaps it's because I didn't really know what they were fighting for.<br /><br />If this is the best that comic books can deliver, I'll stick with regular fiction.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Always like Inspector Rebus books.  I especially like how his character has aged and changed over the years. As always, complicated plot twists, especially at the end
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Great album, but disapointed there is no Bill Ward. I mean, Is it really Black Sabbath without Bill Ward. The CD sounds great, good songs and good production. Love the cover. Wilks is an above average drummer, but I was hoping for the TRUE Black Sabbath, with Bill Ward. It stands out among Sabbath records, and will become a classic.

B00AJLHUA8|5.0|And I've seen SOOOO many.  John Carpenter's &#34;The Thing&#34; has been my favorite since 1982.  However, Sinister has taken a spot right along side it.  This movie is so creepy and eerie.  The musical score lends ominous foreboding throughout.  Character development is good.  D'Onofrio's character was a nice treat, with his Pink Floyd t-shirt and weird knowledge of the occult.  Deputy So-and-So was great comic relief, as this movie is extremely intense.  Hawk's character's drive to reclaim his former fame puts his family in deadly danger.  Extremely disturbing.  Not much gore for a movie so horrifically frightening.  But it did keep me up at night.
B00BTHWFHE|4.0|Perusing the track titles of Black Sabbath's reunion effort [[ASIN:B00BTHWFBK 13 [Deluxe Edition]]] itself signifies the listener is in for quite a 'black' trip.  Titles such as \\"Loner\\" or \\"Damaged Soul\\" are utterly morose while \\"God is Dead?\\" instantly brings 'atheism' to mind.  Dark and foreboding and disregarding Ozzy Osbourne and company's opinions about God, Satan, or religion itself, 13 is a superb heavy metal album.  A 35-year hiatus with the original lineup intact (minus original drummer), seems well worth it for the quality of album delivered here.  The standard edition is only eight tracks deep, but each is a capable, worthwhile listen.<br /><br />\\"End of the Beginning\\" sets the tone from the onset, with Osbourne inquiring philosophically \\"is this the end of the beginning? Or the beginning of the end? Losing control or are you winning? Is your life real or just pretend?\\"  Supported by equally dark guitar and bass, \\"End of the Beginning\\" features diverse sections in regards to form, which doesn't constrict them to just doing one thing musically.  As good as the opener is, it's the &uuml;ber-controversial \\"God is Dead?\\" that both raises an eyebrow and sinfully 'cries out' for repeated listens.  Grinding in tempo and miserable as albeit, Osbourne speaks of \\"Blood on my conscious / and murder in mind\\" as well desecrating 'communion' on the chorus as he sings \\"Give me the wine / you keep the bread / the voices echo in my head / is God alive or is God dead? Is God dead?\\" While a accusatory finger is pointed towards God throughout the track, Ozzy plays up multiple meanings when he proclaims later \\"I don't believe that God is dead.\\"  Though it is a divisive topic, it is also Black Sabbath's crowning achievement.<br /><br />\\"Loner\\" quickens the pace but doesn't end the 'blows' to happiness  as he asks \\"I wonder if the loner can assimilate...\\".  On the exceptional \\"Zeitgeist\\", Osbourne gives a scathing view of the world, in which \\"the strings of fear they are holding up the race / the answers buried underground...\\"  Previously, it is interpretable that 'the puppets' Osbourne refers to are humankind.  On \\"Age of Reason\\", humankind continues to draw the ire of the band, with \\"...a fractured human race / a changing revolution disappears without a trace...\\" Furthermore, the suggestion that politics, religion, and money are degrading  appears on the third verse.  The \\"sustainable extinction\\" of which Osbourne sings of reappears in the longevity-questioning \\"Live Forever\\".  The issue is the afterlife, with the idea \\"to burn in hell or bathe in heaven's light\\" making the band uncomfortable.  Making fine use of chromaticism and touting a rousing, definitive metal guitar solo, \\"Live Forever\\" continues the dark excellence.<br /><br />On \\"Damaged Soul\\", Ozzy finds himself in a conundrum, \\"...losing the battle between Satan and God.\\" While he is quick to jump on the ineffectiveness of the church (\\"A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul...\\") he balances out the lyric with the 'other side of the coin' with Satan (\\"...possessed by a demon that had full control...\\").  The disdain for 'God' is in full-force on \\"Dear Father\\", in which \\"a childhood innocence was drowned in your tears / the demons that you fought are feeding your fears...\\" Poetic, atheistic, and devilish, \\"Dear Father\\" ends 13 as tortured as it began.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00BTHWFBK 13 [Deluxe Edition]]] is quite compelling.  The non-religious/skeptical of religion themes might offend some, but considering it is Black Sabbath, the listener knows what they are getting into before purchasing.  As an album itself, it is consistent from top-to-bottom with few rubs. Highly recommended, particularly to the 'metal-heads'.the race / the answers buried underground...\\"  Previously, it is interpretable that 'the puppets' Osbourne refers to are humankind.

0439023521|1.0|The book itself was great, I would give it four stars but the audiobook was atrocious! Do yourself a favor and actually read the book, don't waste your money on the audiobook.  The narrator's voice does not work for this \\"young\\" character, I kept picturing a 40 year old as Katniss, not a (16?) year old.  Also annoying was that she pronounced \\"Hazel\\" as \\"Hazelle\\" which was just completely ridiculous and annoyed the crap out of me.<br /><br />Unfortunately the same person narrates all the books in the trilogy so there isn't any hope it get's better in books 2 and 3. I'm just hoping they realize their mistake and remake them because this was just so bad.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|Spoiler alert! I really like Danny Boyle's film work, so I was curious to see an unknown (to me) sci fi thriller he had directed in 2007. As with every film Boyle directs, the movie's visual style is inventive, and at moments, breathtakingly beautiful (the images of the dying sun are spectacular). In terms of the story arc, the film seemed to be going in an interesting metaphysical direction when it took a rather a rather sharp turn towards slasher-like movie about 25 minutes before the end. I have read discussions on line arguing that this section of the film is a fantasy, a poetic representation of the astronauts' collective mental dissolution as they near their goal with the nuclear payload, but that seems a little tough to reconcile with the rest of the film. Nonetheless, this is a beautiful -albeit flawed- little gem. Recommended.

One of those  films you see that is life changing movie for most. A love story with humanistic quality about it and on screen chemistry that runs straight to your heart. The writing and the story play are just that good.  I have never seen a film with same subject -so never boring not even for a second,either . Have bought for my permanent collection and it takes a good movie to make it there! Unsure and need to pick out a date night flick or inspiring movie for yourself?

Noticed no one got up to go to concession stand or restroom! Sometimes ,so quiet with audience so enthralled, it felt like no one was breathing!--- FYI-don't take out or stop this film, before credits at the end --Anyone over the age of 45 will recognize the only( and I mean only flaw) to the movie. where a famous person so involved and perhaps cause of events-TRIES TO REWRITE HISTORY - by  verbal statement after film is over, but before credits run.

B001OKJU4M|4.0|Yes. GREAT acting in portrayal of a man breaking down -who always&#34; played by the rules&#34;.  Now ,for entertainment value this is par none -as sure many have just felt some of the Michael Douglas character's response to his sudden plight.  Affecting so many in our country, this might feel healing as an outlet of sorts, again ,as movie 99.9% of people could never act this way in real life, even if felt like tossed garbage. Hollywood's scripting of this film and the sensitive acting would make it a must see for any film buff ,who did not see it before now . Its relevance seems more applicable in 2013. Rare award winning acting by Douglas,also.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|Very entertaing good sound and color. We saw acts we had not seen before since we have seen many shows in person. I would recomend this film as good family entertainment.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|When I first saw commercials of this and saw it was compared to Rocky, I did not care for it. I have no interest in the Rocky franchise. Still, what harm was there in renting it? My opinion now hurts.<br />Charlie Kenton is a \\"has-been,\\" no longer able to catch up to his past debts. But that's not the only reason he no longer holds robot fights. That, along with a custody battle for his young, estranged son, sets off a small series of events that help bring him back up to the world of robot fights. Especially with how the robot he's using, \\"Atom,\\" is a first-generation fighter with a couple features that help the fight progression keep level.<br />At first, like in the show Spartacus, Charlie has to go through underground, dirty-style fighting rings. Beyond that, he's also getting to know his son, who has a very good, working knowledge on the history of robot fighting.<br />On the angles: even though Evangeline Lily's character, Bailey Tallet, is considered, from the amazon.com review, to be the perfunctory love interest, I did not catch a strong \\"love interest\\" angle through the movie. Maybe hints of attraction, but nothing that forces the film away from the action, nor the drama that drives the scenes. Then there's the \\"underdog\\" subtheme, showing how a little kid, with a huge heart, can have people's attention and seriously peeve off the big-corporate people (how he stands up to the Japanese boss and his assistance with his outright gall actually had me cheering, something I normally don't do for a movie). It didn't feel off-setting for this movie. Instead, it felt contextually appropriate for that to be here. It also felt appropriate for the kid, young and highly rambunctious and extremely energetic, to have the most energy in his acting for this film. Jackman's character is also rambunctious, but appropriately less-than for an adult. Lily' character is more of a grounding character so the guys don't get too wild and set everyone in a good background check, of sorts.<br />Durand does a decent presentation of a man seeking his money from the man who owes him a debt (even if he has to be a typical southern-style loan shark), and Yune's character is both serious and seriously comical (particularly with how his machine's defeated and how he reacts to it, it made me crack up pretty good).<br />So, all-in-all, this was a surprisingly good film to watch, with a breakout performance by a new actor, memorable performances by veteran actors and actresses, great special effects, a nice storyline to keep things going, and truly excellent fight scenes with each robot (and humans), along with good dashes of subtle humor to keep it grounded and not so bland with testosterone.<br />Now for the hard part: waiting for the sequel to come out.orts.<br />Durand does a decent presentation of a man seeking his money from the man who owes him a debt (even if he has to be a typical southern-style loan shark), and Yune's character is both serious and seriously comical (particularly with how his machine's defeated and how he reacts to it, it made me crack up pretty good).<br />So, all-in-all, this was a surprisingly good film to watch, with a breakout performance by a new actor, memorable performances by veteran actors and actresses, great special effects, a nice storyline to keep things going, and truly excellent fight scenes with each robot (and humans), along with good dashes of subtle humor to keep it grounded and not so bland with testosterone.<br />Now for the hard part: waiting for the sequel to come out.

B005DJGMQE|5.0|Excellent movie,actually watched parts of twice through. Everyone knows the John Wilkes Booth part of the saga but that is not what this film focuses on.  Two main themes found fascinating was the did the country, actually have the ability to execute a woman and if so what would it take to push public opinion of the time in that way,  How would her defense  and treatment go? what were facts involving this untold tale.<br />Lastly the film poses huge question of should a Military Tribunal hearing ever replace the checks and balances of the regular US court system of trial by jury of your peers? Would this be good, different or the same.  Would it be constitutional for that to be applied toward citizens only? So ,best Lincoln movie out their for me.  No fluff,  very watchable screenplay with EXCELLENT acting by the cast!
