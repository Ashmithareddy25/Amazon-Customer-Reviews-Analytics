B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I have been wanting to see this movie since I first saw the previews last year. I finally got to watch the movie over the weekend and I loved it. It was funny and different than a lot of other movies out there. I loved it so much that I watched it again!

B00845MRKE|5.0|This is the first set that includes every version of the movie.  the 1992 Director's cut is the best in my opinion
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love this new book in the series, and this one was so amazing. I am excitedly waiting on the new one to come out.
0060853972|5.0|Hard to put this book down!  While not a big Terry Pratchett fan, the combination with Neil Gaiman was great (and I went on to read just about everything by Neil Gaiman).  You know these two had to have a fantastic time writing this.  Hilarious!

B009POCG2C|4.0|Whereas MONEYBALL makes a case for the cold hard stats of sabermetrics, THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE celebrates the gut instinct and the long years of experience of the baseball scout. In the realm of America's national pastime, old Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) roams, a dinosaur in the era of the tech-savvy armchair pundit. Gus is a veteran baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. In the twilight of his career, his eyes are steadily failing him. It's not fully incapacitated him yet, but he's steady tripping over stuff now. His contract is up in three months. He gets wind that management is set to put him out to pasture. Gus, that stubborn, snarling mule, is just ornery enough to prove them wrong.<br /><br />Mickey (Amy Adams) is Gus's estranged 33-year-old daughter, an ambitious attorney on the cusp of being made partner. She's named after her dad's favorite baseball player. When an old family friend approaches her to relate her father's faltering vision, she's guilted into coming along Gus's latest scouting foray, never mind that Gus is fiercely against her tagging along. That tender father-daughter intimacy thing just ain't his bag.<br /><br />I could've sworn GRAN TORINO was the last bow, and that Eastwood was forever done with the acting side of the industry. But acting's an itch, isn't it? You can say that THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE is a bit obvious, and there's no arguing from me. You can say it's too leisurely paced, but that's what you get with character studies. The film works hard to get into the skins of its characters, is diligent with examining the two leads' foibles and quirks and a slew of neuroses that runs bone deep. It peels back layers. There are tiny details and pieces of memory that unfold gradually, the blend and sum of which explain away that monumental rift between Gus and Mickey. Gus is such a defensive, self-reliant old cuss. It literally pains him to have to depend on someone. You never question his daughter's committment to set things right. After all, this is Amy Adams playing the role, and Amy Adams exudes sunshine and light. The question always was will Gus learn to bend and meet her halfway. He's never had before.<br /><br />I'm still not sold on Justin Timberlake as an actor. In each film I'd seen him in before, he seemed to be always \\"on.\\" That feeling doesn't evaporate with his performance here, but he's likable as the once promising pitcher ('til he wrecked his arm) and now fledgling scout for the Red Sox. He strikes an easy familiarity with Eastwood and is off-the-cuff charming with Adams. Timberlake presents the film's secondary and tertiary plotlines. Not only is he Mickey's potential love interest, he and Gus are vying for the same high school power hitter. More instrumental is that he provides the bridge between Gus and Mickey. Who would've thunk it that JT could pull off a part that's funny and diplomatic and wise? But his clogging is horrible.<br /><br />THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE works too hard for the perfect conclusion, except by that time I am so invested in the characters and their interactions that damn if I didn't lap it all up, all the convenient but very satisfying endings (Take that, Matthew Lillard!). The narrative won't ambush you with crazy plot twists. The conflicts are ones that play out a lot in typical familial relationship dramas. But Eastwood and Adams' nuanced performances glue you to where you'd parked your butt. I enjoyed THE TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE, but for Eastwood, GRAN TORINO is the better film to go out on. This is a good thing. There's hope that he won't retire just yet from in front of the camera.ter all, this is Amy Adams playing the role, and Amy Adams exudes sunshine and light.

0788859544|5.0|Having a little one sometimes dictates you have to order hard to find or older classic movies. Found this DVD and it was exactly what i needed. The product was new and not a weird foreign version of this Disney classic. Got the product pretty fast with regular shipping and my daughter was excited to open the package up.

B00BF123WG|4.0|this was good because it helped to explain some of the &#34;non action&#34; related elements to finding Bin Laden.If all or most of it is true, then you get to see how long it took to gather the intelligence, to act on it, and what exactly was the technique that worked. It's almost like Zodiac in the way where the movie portrays people who dedicated their lives to finding Bin Laden.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I read this book because my friend Julia was reading it too.  I liked how Cheryl took me over mountain ranges and told me about the people and animals she met. It was a coming of age kind of book but one that is set to the natural order of Mother Nature.
B000LGOPW2|5.0|I wanted the dvd and ordered instant video by mistake.  However I was satisfied.  I was able to wait till later to see it.  And could see it as many times as I wanted.  An interesting experience.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock has changed my life.  Fave features are the option of decreasing snooze times and increasing math problems on each snooze.  It's very customizable and as soon as my mind and body get used to a setting I can change things up and its like new again.  Really love this app.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I rated this book a 5 star read because I couldn't put it down.  I'm attached to the characters and am very interested in seeing how this all plays out and who will end up with who. With that being said I am very much annoyed with how America flip flops with her feelings. One minute she wants one guy the next it's the other. The ending makes me believe she has made a choice, so hopefully that is true. In my opinion it's a no brained choice. I'm wanting to shake her and say quit playing with our emotions and choose already, because we the readers have! WELL I HAVE AT LEAST! Lol

B00BXVKKPA|4.0|Well you know what they say. \\"If it ain't broke don't fix it\\". Well Airborne have proven this 3 times now, and you know what? I love them for it!<br /><br />\\"Black Dog Barking\\" is the third album from these Tasmanian rockers. These boys have picked up the flag of rock n' roll and they fly it proud. Is there anything new on this record that you've never heard? No of course not. But if you've heard their first 2 albums then you know that this is nothing but tons of AC/DC worshiping hard rock. But, but they do it so darn well!<br /><br />\\"Black Dog barking\\" is nothing but fist pumping, head banging, screaming rock n' roll. This is the first review I've done on Airborne even though I've been a fan since the first album. I just wanted to make sure this band wasn't going anywhere, and it looks like there here to rock our heads off!<br /><br />There just isn't anymore I can say. If your a huge fan of AC/DC, Krokus, Rhino Bucket, or any hard rock from the 80s buy this record.<br /><br />It reinvents the wheel, but in this depressing age of modern rock we are in Airborne are here to help save us.<br /><br />And you know what? I say thank you!

I also like all the goals and special powers in this one.

B00BUADSMQ|2.0|I was disappointed with this installment of Die Hard due to the lack of any kind of story or emotional content (it was too short to have this much action and a story). The action was plentiful, but boring because it was all done before in previous Die Hard's. The first four Die Hard & The Bourne Trilogy are my favorite series of movies. This movie was flat and did not come close to the others!

This was a book club selection, suggested by one of ours members, and I'm looking forward to our meeting in a few weeks.  Marvelous and haunting, stirring and bloody riveting.  You'll love it, even if you're generally not swayed (as is my wont) by 'action' fiction.<br /><br />Rebecca Emlinger Roberts
B00C8985DU|5.0|There are certain moments that make a rock musician an icon. Paul Mccartney has been blessed with a career with plenty of those moments. A true icon in every sense and not only a member of the royalty of rock but of an even higher status of a mythical god-like status as well.<br /><br />1976 was a major year for Paul Mccartney. Already a dinosaur because of the huge legacy of the Beatles was such a high mark to live up to. Yet, it was like Beatlemania all over again, with sell out concerts, high record sales, and great reviews. One would ask how could someone be as so lucky as to conquer the entire world again--AMERICA as well. With his band Wings he did.<br /><br />Long before his true legendary status, this was way before he was knighted Sir Paul and only six years on after the Beatles split, Paul was an older and wiser man, although only in his early thirties at the time, with a travelling band and travelling family, on one of the biggest tours of all time. Only Peter Frampton comes to mind during this time frame. Wanting to refrain from playing Beatles hits on the early Wings tours, he got a bit nostalgic and decided to pull out all the stops with Wings Over America. The success and the excitement of Wings and this tour caused quite a bit of rumors that the Beatles were getting back together, but it never happened. But with Wings Over America, Mccartney made icons of his new band too.<br /><br />Mccartney performs with sheer confidence unparalleled by any other artist, and his voice is at it's finest from his wails to his laid back ballad voice as he seemlessly moves from bass to piano to guitar throughout the entire set. Mccartney is having fun again playing music and it shows in every song with the energy that he and Wings put into the arrangements. Wings Over America also proved to many that Wings had come a long way in their many line-up changes, finally settling on a hard working, hard rocking unit. It was Paul's show but doesn't hog too much of the spotlight as he also allowed room for his band members to sing their songs as well. All of Wings hits were included in this package and much more superior versions than their studio counter parts.<br /><br />Even the great Denny Laine got a bit nostalgic with a nod to his old band mates the Moody Blues with his inclusion of \\"Go Now\\". But Wings Over America was more than just a glorious \\"hits\\" tour, for fans who'd been hoping to hear Beatles songs finally after the split, but it solidlified Mccartney's place as a solo artist with not only a great history, and a chance to really free himself of the huge shadow that his former band had cast. He had gone on to become the most successful solo Beatle. It's kind of funny to see such a young man reflect so nostalgically about his rich past, with all of his accomplishments that happened at such an early age. That is the stuff icons are made of.<br /><br />The live concert film which documents the final night of this tour at the Seattle Kingdome may be a bit dated, but still a great example of Mccartney and band as a well rehearsed, well-oiled hit- making machine with tons of smoke bombs, laser lights and crowd pleasing moments. Even after all these years Mccartney is one of the hardest working musicians at his age. Wings Over America to me is one of the greatest moments in rock and roll history that fans of the Beatles and Mccartney should experience and dive into, if you are not a fan, this may be a great place to start.ht as he also allowed room for his band members to sing their songs as well.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Others may break down each track of 13. I'll attempt to break down a far bigger picture of what this remarkable album represents.<br /><br />While it appears that the positive reactions to this album will certainly trounce the negative, it has been somewhat astonishing to read some of the criticism surrounding Black Sabbath's 13. Truth be told, despite dipping into the well that brought them fame and fortune, this is a very progressive album and it requires an attentive listener to fully comprehend everything that it is about. Many of these songs are harmonically diverse with complex arrangements, tempo shifts, and utterly fascinating developments with twists and turns that somehow never cross into the \\"pretentious.\\" Instead, the process strikes as organic and most of these tracks attain a very impressive and natural \\"flow\\" to the ideas at hand. True Sabbath fans will recognize this approach all too well and find the greatest joys in hearing a band with this level of musicianship back in action. Casual fans or the uninitiated may need quite a few listens to understand all that is contained within these compositions.<br /><br />How many times have you heard comments that the opening track sounds like the title track of their debut album all those years ago? And yet, that only tells a minor part of the story. \\"The End Of The Beginning\\" is epic Sabbath and a sound that only Sabbath can stretch toward and attain. It opens more like \\"Under The Sun,\\" then finds its way into the \\"Black Sabbath\\" comparisons when the riff softens to that familiar feel, but it then drifts into a riff that would have been comfortable on Master Of Reality until somehow finding Sabotage and finally landing in Technical Ecstasy territory. Naysayers will cite these sections as having been pulled from their 70s heyday, but in reality these ideas have never been juxtaposed in this manner. And somehow, some way ... it all has a certain \\"freshness\\" about it.<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" is an absolutely breathtaking revisit to the band's \\"spacey,\\" \\"jazzy\\" side. While some will argue that this territory was already explored on \\"Planet Caravan,\\" I would submit that the band is simply taking ownership of yet another sub-genre that they in fact created. I've lost count of how many they have been credited with. Perhaps we can now call this sub-genre the \\"space jazz-metal ballad?\\" In other words, by using a specific approach which they came up with in the first place, they are able to revisit while at the same time pushing the idea forward. Pay attention to the vocal melodies and the way the song takes shape. This isn't \\"Planet Caravan\\" or \\"Solitude.\\" This is the band that *created* \\"Planet Caravan\\" and \\"Solitude.\\" Of course the similarities are there, because nobody sounds like this and they invented it!<br /><br />And that's the thing about Sabbath. The diversity which they were able to find while retaining their trademark \\"heavy\\" sound was often remarkable. Somehow, they were a band that brought innovation to nearly everything they attempted. They were essentially peerless in this respect. Ballads? Sabbath's never sounded like anybody else's. Instrumental, acoustic guitar work? Ok, you tell me about the influences on \\"Don't Start (Too Late).\\" Medieval campfire music? Maybe Robert Fripp? In fact, take any of Sabbath's acoustic work, it sure wasn't \\"West Coast\\" folk music or anything wedged between tracks on other \\"hard rock\\" albums. Nope ... instead, no matter what they did, at the core of Sabbath's 70s run was a constant theme of innovation. Some critics didn't get it. Some rock fans didn't get it. But Sabbath knew their \\"brand.\\" And those who mattered to Sabbath \\"got it.\\" And those fans were almost never disappointed. Some would argue that they had a few missteps, but you find me a guitar player who can even transcribe the solos to songs like \\"You Won't Change Me\\" or \\"Air Dance\\" and I bet I'll find you a guy who doesn't necessarily buy that even at their supposed \\"worst\\" these guys were anything less than ridiculously talented freaks from some other planet of rock music.<br /><br />That same spirit of innovation and belief in the \\"Black Sabbath brand\\" is evident here. Oh sure, it's watered down because of digital recording and horrible, compressed mastering (the CD, that is ... the vinyl sounds far better and you should own it instantly -- it has twice the dynamic range of the CD!), but inside these songs are enough different rides to please even the most difficult to impress \\"old school\\" Sabbath fan. And I won't lie, the fact that these guys worked this hard on this material (don't let their humility in interviews fool you) in their mid 60s is an accomplishment that I suspect is not met with a great many peer. And you're right that because of that I *root* for this album. I also root for this album because Sabbath is the greatest living proof that some of the most devoted rock music fans can't be fooled. Armed with enough nonsense from enough writers who hadn't the faintest clue of the level of musical brilliance that Sabbath possessed or the lyrical insights which they attempted to exchange, the \\"mainstream\\" press couldn't keep these guys down. Fans knew better. Black Sabbath was a \\"people's band\\" and their continued success is a triumph of their ever growing fan base having an intimate understanding of their musical genius.<br /><br />Ward is sadly missed here. If anybody tries to argue that he isn't, then his rock and roll membership card should be subject to immediate revocation. If Bonham played like a horse; galloping through songs with power and driving his band forward like a freight train, Ward was a snake. He slithered through minefields of tempo changes and dynamic shifts with the intensity of a Cobra. He swung with riffs like a Rattlesnake but other times restrained himself like a Python waiting to attack its prey. And oh, let's not forget that he could also pounce upon grooves with the white-hot intensity of molten lava easing its way down a mountainside. He was a human metronome with a jazz sensibility. Arguably the rarest of combinations amongst rock drummers. He helped shape Sabbath into one of the most distinctive sounding acts of the 70s or any other era. But at this stage, I think we must talk about those who came to this party. Mr. Ward's reasons for declining his invitation are perhaps not fully understood, but are surely not without merit. Still, we have reached the point where the music and the concept of Black Sabbath at current must be judged on its own merits, and that means we must acknowledge the reality that the band now exists without Bill Ward.<br /><br />Osbourne's vocal melodies on 13 should remind of just what an important component he was to the Sabbath sound. Does that mean there is a \\"Spiral Architect\\" here? No. Will \\"The Writ\\" be challenged on its throne atop any reasoned list of \\"heavy metal\\" epics? I suspect not. But this album has vocal work that sits on the Moon. It isn't even of this Earth. It's \\"buzzed out,\\" high pitched, wailing ear candy that will sooth your tired brain in this world of American Idolists and trumped up Steve Wonder rip-offs. Osbourne's voice will still stand out a mile when it's heard a hundred years from now. And here, it doesn't matter that he isn't at his absolute technical peak any longer. As a comparison, think of Billie Holiday in some of her most trying, drug-addled performances as the years rolled on. She still packed more spirit in those pipes than a hundred of the best younger and more technical jazz singers combined. It was a combination of ability and a unique, raw force of nature that propelled her voice into your heart. Ozzy sings his heart out for you on this album. Let your ears enjoy it and forget for a moment that he \\"can't sing the highest parts\\" of your favorite mid 70s Sabs track. This is about what he can do. And what he can do still amounts to glorious sounds that others can't attain. It's in the blood ofhis tracks of life.<br /><br />Tony Iommi still plays with an intensity only he can conjure up from the darkest realms of space. A combination of phenomenal, self-taught techniques and gallons upon gallons of soul. Take just the opening chords of \\"The End Of The Beginning\\" as the perfect example. You could ask a thousand \\"brilliant\\" guitarists to play those chords. None would achieve that spine-tingling intensity he does. None would find those perfect places to accentuate that uniquely innovative vibrato he places on full chords. None would sound like him. His leads on this album are extraordinary. They are often improvised and retain an \\"off the cuff\\" feel that he was able to extract on albums like 'Technical Ecstasy' and 'Never Say Die!' Whatever those albums \\"lacked\\" in the ridiculously amazing arsenal of 70s Sabbath, they featured some of the most remarkable guitar work of his generation. Few of his peers landed there. While perhaps his work at this late stage can't *quite* approach his work at that point, he's on fire with passion on this album and he is taking names. Tony Iommi, folks. Tony Iommi. May his work on this record evoke a few tears from your eyes. The man is a machine with a heart.<br /><br />Geezer Butler's bass work reminds us once again why it is possible to find fills and runs that will fit into every groove while never losing it. He's busy here, but as always -- and as is so important to all the members of Sabbath -- his work is disciplined and musical. And his lyrics offer observations of the world in which we now find ourselves. Some won't \\"get\\" them. Some will think they mean things they don't. Others will argue that he can't come up with stuff like he could at his peak on albums like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Sabotage. I think he has delivered phenomenal commentaries on modern life and finds valid questions about the belief systems inherent in different walks of life. Religion, politics, computerized society ... The \\"Master Of Reality\\" strikes again.<br /><br />13 is a five star album not because it's Sabbath's best work, but because Sabbath's best work rates as six stars on five star scales. That's the standard which they set. Let this album take you on a journey far away from what has happened to rock music and enjoy every last minute of it. This is a remarkable album from a remarkable team.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|If you have enjoyed the last two Ice Ages add this one to your collection, it is great, you woun't be disappointed.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|It's a great movie to just take your brain out of gear and enjoy the trip.  No redeeming value other than just fun.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|It was exactly what I thought it would be- in good condition and it worked fine. It was priced so cheaply I didn't think it would all be this perfect but it was! What a deal!!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This is not just another Holocaust story but rather tells of a little known incident in Paris during the Vichy years.  While all Holocaust stories are heartbreaking, this one is particularly moving because of the ages of the children, the love between them, and the years that pass between wondering the fate of one child by the other.  The story is well-told, the characters believable and the plot moves along rapidly.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I love this series and will hate to see it end!  It's an incredilbe story about the Borgia family.  I don't know if it's even close to the truth of the family, but the story lines hold my interest and when I'm watching during the season, I can't wait for next week's episode!  Buying the DVD, I can watch whenever I want.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love this Pendergast series of books.  This one again, I couldn't put down.  The main character is quirky and storyline always full of intrigue.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|I've spent too much time discussing and reviewing this record, when I should be doing more productive things. Hahaha.....Maybe I'll come back and edit this later.  Please bring back Bill Ward if in fact, you do record a follow up. This record flatly does not justify the wait. From the sound, to the title and the artwork.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|Absolutely brilliantly done with a cast of characters whose acting talents are far superior to nearly every other on network television. You cannot surpass the level of depth of character development, the writing, where as they discuss real theories of psychology; build up, and character development between Will Graham and Dr. Lecter is unlike anything else on television and cannot be done with a movie.<br /><br />Eventually we will view shows like this one not to be just a show, but rather a series of movies, each telling a story, where at one point a 2 hour movie will not be enough anymore to satisfy our palate for something as savory as this series.<br /><br />This will become a classic.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|What a joy to hear this soundtrack and have a real CD at hand rather than only a download. Great music and very good quality. Matches the movie.
0670026638|5.0|Bang up to date tale of two young women - one in the Pacific Northwest, one in Japan.<br />The writing sparkles - Ms Ozeki holds great promise. An excellent entertainment. Bravo.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an amazing book and as one who has cancer, I read this book very closely...it is Heaven sent and this is the second time I have read it. I do look to the after life and to be with our Lord.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I read this book in 2 days. It was hard to put down. The characters were very interesting and the plot was detailed and well thought out.  Loved it!
B005LAII1C|4.0|If you liked There's Something About Mary, then you'll Love Ted. It is a total guy flix with no socially redeeming qualities.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I can't wait to read the next book. I wish I could read it now. I have to know what is going to happen next. A lot was revealed in this book, but I need to read more! I am addicted to this series!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Look at Ben Affleck - all grown up and everything! Well directed, great acting, and deserving of the best picture Oscar.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed the movie. We even watched it more than once. We go to all Bruce Willis movies anyway.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Fast paced story of a talented Mossad agent going after a terrorist. Lots of twists and turns. Great read and recommended.
B000VM9Z8K|3.0|I found it hard to like and relate to the main character....the story was missing something...never put my finger on what it was missing exactly....it was the kind of book you read if you want light, non-complex plots. When I started to reviewed the book I saw the title and laughed because it was as if the book was asking me, &#34;Remember Me?&#34; and I answer &#34;not really&#34;
B000SEIK2S|5.0|So a co-worker of mine suggested John Scalzi when I couldn't find anything good to read.  He told me to start here... and WOW.  Not only have I read the entire Old Man War's series, but have branched off into his other books.<br /><br />But it all starts with this book.<br /><br />Amazing.<br /><br />The Science Fiction.  The Humor.  The intricate woven character stories.  Pure genius.<br /><br />One warning: If you read this book, you will end up reading all of his other books.  So if you are not prepared for that, then by all means pass on this great tale.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really liked the book, the only problem I had was the fact that the character sabotaged herself through every experience and situation in her life. That was used to carry the story and it got a little predictable.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Again, Mr. Grisham has the gift to tell a good story.  It is not my favorite Grisham novel but well worth the read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Er. Mi. Girsh. Best. Game. EVA! I am ssssooooo addicted. I think that this is the funniest game Eva! And yes I said funniest. Schools out so ya. I HIGHLY recommend this game. Especially if u liked temple run
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good read on such a frightening concept on how our world would look and how it would react to a zombie apocalypse.  Makes you want to read with the lights on, doors locked and windows s*** tightly, don't forget to  Pick your feet up from the couch as you read.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|A teenage love story...told with zombies.  All that is missing is for the zombies to sparkle. This is the twighlight of zombie movies...skip it.
B003V63VNI|5.0|I'm a huge Incubus fan and when I heard he put out his solo album I had to support my favorite artist. Guess what, I love it. I recommend it greatly.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I wish I had read this book 20 years ago! Great lessons! Perfect for a graduation gift for college or high school.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Not a great deal happened in this book it is more of a set up for what i believe will be a fantastic crossfire 4. A must read and really looking forward to the next book hope I don't have to wait to long.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|In this book renowned physicist Feynman takes us through the events of his rather interesting life, which is enjoyable to read for any type of a person. He begins from the time when he was just a child, taking us through many interesting events he enjoyed all around the world, including the parts he played in many important discoveries and events such as the Manhattan Project. At the same time he keeps us entertained by frequently adding comical comments throughout. This book is really a must-read for anyone looking into the life of Feynman.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I didn't like the way the series ended. I thought it was the worst of all the books in the series.
B009E3EY38|5.0|It was so enjoyable watching those videos of LED. after all this years!!<br />Thanks!!!!! very good material and good price!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read the book twice.  She had some good cliff hanger yeah it might have miss somethings.  But if you read the author notes she said their is still one more book. Yeah the book sounded like it was about to end.  I too felt like damn this is it.  Some much hasn't been solved. Like who covered for who and her relationship with her mom. But don't give up people I have faith the she will end it with a happy and yet resolving ending .we will get answer . Keep strong
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a twist!  This book was gripping and suspenseful and the twist took me for a loop.  Cleverly written.  Would definitely recommend to others.
B00821OX98|3.0|I think that the series is good. One of the main things that I didn't like in the series is it doesn't show/cover the invasion since day one. It was like boom.....they are here and stuff is already going on. But for a TV show it is ok. I watched the whole season and plan on watching the next one (2) when I get a chance.
0451418433|3.0|I first read &#34;Fall of the Giants&#34;, which I thought was a fantastic book.  This book however- although as long if not longer- was a more difficult and less interesting read.  The characters do not seem to have the spontaneous life as they did in Fall of Giants and at times Follett gets caught up in what I can only call drivel.  This book is about a 1000 pages,  it could have easily been 300-400 and been just as meaningful and more enjoyable.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Enjoyed this on my new Kindle Fire. Great movie, from beginning to end. Recommend for those who love a good ending.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only is it confusing but to much gore and terrible storie line. Very confused why so many great stars are in it, must be getting hard in Hollywood for the stars to mak egood movies. Whatever we hated it and will not keep it in our movie library.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|this is the first album in a long time i was awaiting the release of after hearing female robbery and visiting their website to listen to demos.  I'm very happy to say it surpassed my expectations which is extremely rare.  definitely check it out.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|One to keep to watch over and over. Great stars and good acting, only problem everybody wants to borrow our DVD.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Quick and easy read. I was sad to finish the book. Wish there was another coming. Characters were well thought out and believable.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|In temple run 2 you run from a zombie gorilla for your life but there are a few bugs and glitchs but it's still fun<br /><br />  -Ethan
1449433251|5.0|My grandson was introduced to Calvin and Hobbes by his grandfather and loved the few books we have. We decided to buy the set for his 10th birthday - best present ever!<br />Very good service by Amazon too.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|In all honesty, this deserves four and a half stars or so, but I gave it five to offset the people who are knocking it because their device doesn't have a rear facing camera.  THAT IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE APP!!! It's basically a cool PDF creater/organizer and works well for what it is supposed to do.  That being said, I got it for free, not totally sure I would pay for it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|After I saw the complete James Bond I was going to get it at Costco but before I did they sold out and I thought my chances of getting it were done.  Then I remembered Amazon and the addition of Skyfall rounded out the collection nicely
B004SBX112|4.0|This is probably my least favorite of the angry birds games, but it's still a lot of fun and a good way to kill some time. Grab it if you're an angry birds fan, but if you are only going to end up playing one or two of the games, there are better ones.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Although I did find this game entertaining  there was a few aspects of the game I did not enjoy. Too many ho scenes imo ( just my personal preference) . The ho scenes did have zoom but for me it was not enough they hid some objects to the EXTREME!  Not enough mini games (again just my personal  preference) and frankly they weren't as fun or challenging as others I've seen. Finally  the game is too short. I thought REALLY!?! this is how it ends? so abruptly? Really was a shame becouse the game has an interesting storyline as well as great sound effects that really add to the experience of the game. Ran fine on kfhd 8.9.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|If you are looking for a white noise generator, this probably has the most bells and whistles of anything out there.  For range of sounds, it can't be beat.  Bear in mind, I got this for free, I would probably have stuck with the free version if amazon didn't offer this as the app of the day, I don't see all that much of a difference.
0679805273|5.0|My daughter recieved this for a college graduation. My Kindergarten is reciting parts from this at their graduation, it is great for any Dr. Seuss  lover !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I was disappointed by all of the negative reviews, but I read it anyway because I had read the other two books.  I enjoyed Requiem and thought the ending was perfect because it wasn't definitive. I don't need to have every detail spelled out to believe that everything will be as it should be.  I thought Lena and others behaved true to character. It was a very believable ending to the story the author told.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|The only drawback is that you need a passenger to get the really good features working for you. Its a great concept
0345803493|4.0|I love this series! I'm ready for my 3rd book to come from this series!<br /><br />The cover was a little messed up and a stain on the pages of the book but overall, it looks brand new with a little shelf wear. Perfect.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|This movie is nothing and I do mean nothing but watching some kid run through the woods and such for over an hour.  It was difficult to watch so boring a flick.  I like Wil Smith's movies but this venture is an absolute flop.  I am pleased I did not buy it but watched it at a friends house.  Your money would be better spent buying the woman in your life some flowers or taking her out to dinner.<br /><br />What a total,absolute, complete, thorough waste of plastic to make this DVD.  So much so it will be a contributor to waste management in the city dump where most of the DVD's of this movie are headed.<br /><br />Please Mr. Wil Smith make a better movie like you have before :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|BOUGHT THIS FOR FUTURE READING.  HOPE IT IS AS GOOD AS EVERYONE SAYS.  THANKS FOR BEING THERE AMAZON.  LOVE YOU.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Just write Bruce Willis a check,  this movie is pointless.  It is a waste of time without plot or dialog.  The action makes no sense
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|BOUGHT THIS FOR FUTURE READING.  HOPE IT IS AS GOOD AS EVERYONE SAYS.  THANKS FOR BEING THERE AMAZON.  LOVE YOU.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started reading this book on Saturday night, with the Kindle sample. I just finished it on Tuesday afternoon and I'm going to buy the Shift books next to continue the story. I couldn't put the book down. It is amazing and well worth the read.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I have this installed on my phone as well as my google TV. It performs flawlessly! Highly recommended! Handles video, music (including playlists) and, photos.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A surprisingly refreshing read; I've been gobbling up post apocalyptic fiction for weeks now and was running out of titles to read. I chanced upon this, and it sucked me right in. A very unusual take on the genre, but realistic, and well written. I look forward to more stories about the silos, thank you.
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Please save your money and wait for cable.  I think Tom has fell off since the divorce.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was actually pretty funny. I was a little hesitant to watch it but it kept me entertained during my 4 hour flight...
B00C2U6G7C|1.0|I think I can sum up this soundtrack in one sentence: \\"what's the definition of a soundtrack again?\\" Seriously, I forgot what it is because all the drums were too loud. Let's just forget that this was in a Superman movie, okay? John Williams and John Ottman are probably quite disappointed in the attempt at something that doesn't even resemble the iconic American superhero's symphonic history. I hope that this soundtrack is the beginning of a new era in movies, one NOT filled with nonsense and the lack of anything meaningful in a \\"score\\".<br /><br />I want the old Zimmer of Lion King and Gladiator back.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I actually didn't think I was going to say this but I liked this movie. It is a weird movie but I thought they both did an awesome job acting...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My entire family has been hooked on this series since episode one of the first season.  The acting is excellent, scenery gorgeous, and the storyline so intriguing.  If only all TV was this excellent all the time.
B00A3OT34M|4.0|I like Pitbull music so I decided to purchased this CD and I didn't regret it. I'm very happy with it.
B00C1UEYYK|5.0|Loved Season 1, Season 2 is even better.  Back stabbing,  Lies, Murder, Sex, Random accuracy of story line to history.  Love it!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was awesome! It had my boyfriend and I in suspense wanting to know what was going to happen. Great ending!
B0015DROBO|3.0|But difficult to read. All of the foreign words made it a slow for me although the story was great and I loved the characters. I found myself reading like this &#34;and the went to ,,,,,,,,,,,,and ate ,,,,,,,,,and walked towards the ,,,,,&#34;.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Not bad not great. I was expecting more funny parts in the movie but other than that it wasn't horrible...
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read this series out of curiosity. It was different and attention getting, for sure. I wasn't disappointed and I was educated
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.7.1 is awesome!!! They added online servers, fire, buckets, and cake!!! With each update comes new and fun parts of the game that make it closer to the pc version. Hopefully soon redstone and more mobs will be added. This game is a must get.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read this series out of curiosity. It was different and attention getting, for sure. I wasn't disappointed and I was educated
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I would recommend anyone looking for that little extra push to advance their career.  This is a really great book for women's career but also motivation for home life too.  Hopefully you enjoy it as much as I did!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read this series out of curiosity. It was different and attention getting, for sure. I wasn't disappointed and I was educated
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I love the characters and the story line in this series, and I looked forward to reading the third book.  However, I was sorely disappointed at the end when I was left hanging once again!  It wouldn't even be so bad if I  didn't anticipate a very long wait for the next book, if there is to be one.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|This was a very interesting movie.  The driving was very exciting to watch, especially going down the hills in California.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|Gottta watch it several times.  It is THAT complicated.  Reading the book helped also, and the movie didn't alter it TOO much. Amazing makeup. Ultra Violet idea is interesting.  Haven't tried it yet.
B00CNB31U0|5.0|love this show and so happy I could instantly download it for 20 dollars!  i'm sure I'll get the next season soon.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I didn't think I'd like classical music. LOL it's pretty soothing. I bought out because I was curious. I like it!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Unlike any album they have made before, completely different sound.  So rare to find good creative original music that still rocks hard nowadays
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|REALLY FUN TO PLAY BUT PRETTY TIME CONSUMING. Like the little pop-ups that help you know what to do. We really enjoy playing this game!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like the challenge in playing this game.  My son and I are very competitive when we play this game. It is very challenging.
B000FA57RG|5.0|If you are a fan of Madonna (long time fan or new fan) this DVD/CD combo is for you!  Shows a behind the scenes documentary of Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention Tour and includes 13 highlights of the tour and 1 Demo of &#34;I Love New York&#34; on cd!  You will not be disappointed!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great social network tool.  Love it.  Able to contact long time friends and relatives that I have not heard from.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|As a fan of the two series of characters, I was glad to see the merging of Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller a few years ago in The Brass Verdict, and this time they again clicked together. A child killer is set free, but this time Haller will be on the side of the prosecution that will re-try him. The villain is easy to hate, and the story moves along at a quick pace. The theme hit home as someone with a small child, and there are some very difficult images that are involved in the story. It was a great read, and I hope Michael Connelly will continue to pair these two in the future.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Interesting for kids and for bored adults. What's up with the daily tasks not working and waiting 3 days for a fish to drop a pearl. Sometimes you buy coins or pearls etc and you get charged but do not receive your purchase.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|Great for our sons VW Jetta. He asked for it - it was on his Christmas list so I bought it, not<br />really knowing what it was and he said it worked perfectly!
B001R60ESE|5.0|Always love his stuff you won't be disappointed. So many talented folks and so much great music...buy it buy it
B002UJIY7A|5.0|Went to the movies and saw this one and was realllly surprised !! Normally I figure out the ending by the middle of the movie but this one had me fooled! Great excellent actors and really excellent story line. LOVED IT!  This movie had me thinking of it<br />for days and that doesn't happen often so I decided to buy it! We watch it every 6 months or so.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|You will read a lot of reviews out there comparing this work to the original Sabbath albums from 1970 to 1978. These reviews base their opinions on what Sabbath was and it's legacy. The problem with this is that it's 35 years later and a lot of water has gone under that bridge.<br /><br />Comparing this album to those works or to any work of any artist is a natural thing but where it creates a problem is that none of the three members of this band live in a vacuum. In fact, they all have had very public and active lives since 1978 and \\"13\\" is much a reflection of these lives as it is the original works.<br /><br />\\"13\\" is less derivative of anything they have done and more of an homage to the work they created. Clearly, Rick Rubin asked these men to be inspired by the original works but demanded an original creation. What \\"13\\" represents is a culmination of three musical talents looking back and aspiring to make something new yet retaining the character of the old. In this, they succeed beyond question.<br /><br />\\"13\\" definitely feels like old Sabbath from the opening riffs of the \\"End of the Beginning\\" to church bells tolling in the final moments. Each song contains the trademark sounds of Sabbath in its highest and most epic moments. The outstanding guitar work of Tony Iommi, the articulate lyrics and bass of Geezer Butler and the trademark voice of Ozzy Osbourne all combine exactly as they should to make another epic Black Sabbath album.<br /><br />Still, it is a refreshing original record filled with wonderful moments. \\"Damaged Soul\\" and its harmonica laced, bluesy rock or \\"Age of Reason\\" with its monster riffs are evidence that these legends still got game. While other aged artists continue to deliver derivative mediocre, featureless albums, Sabbath has produced something that fits in their catalog but still sounds as fresh as any of the latest releases of a top selling rock artist.<br /><br />Many attribute the invention of Heavy Metal to Black Sabbath and tothis end, this album is solid proof that they are it's inventors and best practitioners. It's darkened, doom laden power permeates every song and delivers metal in its purest form. This album begs to be played loud; annoying the neighbors; shaking the house and scaring the cat.<br /><br />Think of this like a cake your mom used to make. You can put all the ingredients together and bake it yourself but it never turns out the same. Something is missing. Other incarnations of Sabbath and solo projects were great. However, here the original Black Sabbath returns and puts all the same ingredients in and bakes us another delicious cake just like we remember. It might not be exactly the same, but it's damned good just the same.<br /><br />Any fan of the band is going to have a nostalgic turn listening to \\"13.\\" Younger listeners will hear the echoes of the original and might be inspired to go back to the legendary works. In fact, the only people who aren't going to like this album are those expecting it to rival the originals or expecting it to sound like something Sabbath isn't. To that, I say \\"Let them eat cake.\\"
B009NY43NY|2.0|If you've read all the previous books and have been increasingly unhappy with the stories, this is the worst! Poor, poor Sookie. I feel bed for Sookie. I'm totally dissapointed.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Great movie about how everyone can change if they have the chance and become their best.<br /><br />Ever Priest has a past and every sinner has a future!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|My son, 12 loves this movie and it is also one his sister and other family enjoy watching. So it is a happy medium when picking a movie that the family can watchl.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I could hardly put the book down.  I have recommended to all I know. Since I have lived through all the presidents since Roosevelt it was a revaluation.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I just use it for basic calculations: add, subtract, multiply, divide. It works as well as any calculator I've used.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I needed this for a book club project. It was a very easy buy, great movie. Was in new shape and still sealed.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|After seeing this movie when it first came out, I was so looking forward to adding it to my collection.  But apparently Disney greed and lack of foresight will prevent me from buying this title.  It is asinine that Disney a) charge this much for the individual disks, and b) not including the 2D and DVD versions of the title in with the 3D version, ESPECIALLY when the bonus features are not included in the 3D version (per the Amazon \\"Special Options\\" details).
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|There is nothing I find wrong with this film. The direction, the acting, the cinematography, the score, everything is perfect. This is not some cheap horror film, this is a crime thriller all about the hunt for the Zodiac killer. It is edge of your seat entertainment from literally beginning to end. Easily David Fincher's best film. See it...now!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Such a beautiful and refreshingly light comedy about the different situations couples encounter with bearing and raising children! I loved how it wasn't centered on the typical way to having a baby (adoption). This movie is a must see!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. That goes without saying. But my kindle won't let me buy any more apps or. Download any thing else
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Hands down I have never heard another Blu Ray that sounds as good as this. Whether or not you are a John Mayer fan, this Blu Ray is great for testing stereos.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app. With the inclusion of many different versions of the Bible, it also allows you to have an offline version of the Bible. This is useful when you attend a church that didn't have WiFi, like mine. I highly recommend this app to all who are interested in have s Bible with you at all times.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Non stop action, but the story line was week. I gave it three stars for the action scenes. Would have liked to see some continuity from the last film with the daughter character.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A captivating story of a courageous woman running from Hell to start a new life. It was quite the page turner!
B009PNQUXO|4.0|What I like about this downloader is that you can watch your saved videos offline. Very similar to Youtube with the extra feature of offline video watching.<br /><br />This one's a keeper!
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|This is a joyful movie for everyone. It is a love story, and a lesson that teaches that doing things &#34;your way&#34; can make for a &#34;Happy&#34; ending!
1452113432|5.0|I've really enjoyed watching Rachel Khoo's TV show the last couple of months:  She is bright, engaging and accessible. I LOVE the fact that she can create lovely meals with an old metal bowl, the equivalent of a 'camp' stove and a quality toaster oven:  Proof positive that no one needs fancy appliances, 'professional' kitchens, and the best of the best of accoutrements to be an excellent cook.  I have already tried (successfully!) many of the recipes and found her writing very straightforward, her pictures gorgeous and her tips helpful.  This book would be enjoyed by anyone who likes 'real' French food (i.e. chicken livers, stinky cheeses and such) as well as people like me who are not quite as adventurous, but still love flavorful, authentic, fresh French food.  I hope she has a very long and successful career!
1449437524|4.0|This is an adorable book.  It's small and short but funny and ironic.  Great for a gift for a dog lover.
B006UREQ3Y|5.0|Great show and selection of songs Myles delivers and the whole band rocks hope he does another Dvd of his more recent songs.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Very good book which is no less than what I have come to expect in this series. Castle is my favorite tv show and the dialog is very similar in the Nikki Heat books. Eagerly awaiting the next one.
B00CWVBTUU|5.0|My 4 year old son and I love the games and now we love this movie!<br /><br />Getting it in HD was definitely a major plus.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This band is crazy good.  I'm a new Sabbath fan, and I can't stop listening to them.  This CD is very enjoyable in my opinion.  Tony Iommi is one of my favorite guitarists. He has such tasty leads.  I find the drums to be more subdued than some of Sabbath's earlier stuff.  Ozzy sounds great. How does anyone not love Ozzy... He's so endearing, lol.

B001WCN232|5.0|I bought Goats Head Soup in 1973, aged 15, and it has become my favourite Stones album. Mick Jagger used to like this record as well, he considered it superior to \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" I particularly love the lush production and Mick Taylor's guitar playing. The songs are not bad either.<br /><br />I own everything the Stones recorded from \\"Aftermath\\" to \\"Some Girls,\\" plus a couple of the later albums. Goats Head Soup is the record I play more than any other. Many critics have given it poor reviews, which I have never understood. Rolling Stone's 1979 \\"Record Guide\\" gave it One star. It was around that time that I decided that the opinions of rock critics could not always be trusted.<br /><br />Everyone should hear \\"Winter\\" at least once in their life. Taylor's melodic guitar solo and Nicky Hopkins' beautiful piano playing still sound wonderful. The actor Bill Nighy, once appeared on Desert Island Discs and \\"Winter was one of the eight tracks he selected. Bill went up in my estimation.<br /><br />Goats Head Soup has some laid-back tracks but it is still a great rock album. It also seemed like a swan song, while they would still continue to make great music, it was done with less consistency than in the past. By the 1990s the Stones ended up just repeating the same basic formula with diminishing returns. Goats Head Soup was one of their last attempts to do something original. As Jagger said at the time: \\"I really feel close to this album, and I really put all I had into it.\\"
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I'm a big Tarantino fan and needed this movie to complete my collection. Shipped quickly and got to my house fast. I really liked the movie. Would watch it again and again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I can not thank ms Collins enough for such a great story.  Sadly, I am so out of touch today I would never have found this series without the movie.  In my review of Catching Fire I stated that I had to keep reminding myself that this was a book about teens and that they do not think the way Katniss did, today.  However, the reality that ms Collins puts together for us is a mixture of 19th, 20th, & 21st centuries.  It is a good mixture and when we look back to the 1800's girls were married, had children, ran household etc. when they were 14 to 18 and I am sure many were deep thinkers like Katniss.  Many girls were considered old maids if they were not married before the age 20. Once that is realized everything begins to fall into place, as it should.  This whole story was amazing and will be a classic.  I can picture English teachers assigning this series of book as a class assignment and all of the symbolism, etc. that entails.  Again, an amazing trilogy, and even better a great ending to a great story.
B00114RKT8|4.0|The story is gripping, the actors are well cast and excellent!  This was well worth the rental price.  I loved it!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This sequel was as good as the original. A must see for any Karate fan. Jackie Chan was awesomw in his role. A must see.
B009CGR5U6|5.0|A lot of the negativity I read about this movie is from people that were huge fans of the show and cant get over the actors used for the characters..........get over it...the movie is so well put together and works well with current timelines and trends. Go back to season one and compare acting........this movie gets 5 stars.......easy!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This tale begins a bit slow and is confusing at first, but quickly becomes an enthralling page turner. The story is enchanting.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, very suspenseful, with a surprise ending !! I do happen to like all the actors in this movie, so that probably helped.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Coraline is some kids movie from 2009 that I decided to check out, and man it was pretty damn good. The designs were original and visually stunning, without being too sugary like some kids movies are. The story is a girl and her parents move into an old house with some weird tenants, and she finds a wormhole into another dimension of the house where it seems every problem in her life is magically fixed. As the story moves along, it gets pretty creepy at parts, for example when Coraline first goes into the other world and nothing seems wrong, yet human instinct is screaming GET OUT. Things that seem happy and normal in the alternate reality have sinister ulterior motives lurking just underneath the happy-go-lucky surface. The moral for the story was great, in a \\"shut up and learn to appreciate your life\\" kinda way, instead of most kids movies where things magically get better.<br /><br />If I one day get the worst STD imaginable (kids), I'll no doubt show them this film one day.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for my wife.  This isn't the type of move I would enjoy watching but she enjoys it.  I was amazed the it was still sealed in its original packaging.  I thought at the price it may have been viewed a time or two but it had never been opened.  It is  apparent the owner needed to get off the shelve to make room for another product.  I'm glad I could do them that favor because they did me a great favor offering it for the price they did.

B008YKGQR4|4.0|A good approximation of the PC version. Still doesn't have the full flexibility and functionality but is adequate enough most of the time.
B000SGSU58|4.0|This novel is well written with suspense throughout. You will be intrigued all the way through the an interesting trial and an interesting parallel series of murders which are solved by Detective Bosch.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Works like advertised, I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and was able to read files immediately. A useful tool to have when on the go and needing to read documents attached to emails.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like this application. It is very simple and professional.  I'm glad I have Kindle HD Fire. Technology is great!  Thank God for technologies.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Super musicians and music.  Some of the existing pieces that are redone with this group are better than the originals.  The DVD allows an even deeper experience where you can see the performances and truly understand how talented these artists are.  The joy of the performance and the fun the artist's have is clearly evident.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is the best sleep sounds app I have found. Got it as faotd but it's well worth paying for. No problems with breaks in the sound loops which can actually wake you up if you are really dependent upon a sleep machine. You can also mix sounds which is especially nice. It will run down your battery.. as will any app you keep running so I would suggest using it only when phone is plugged in. That seems like a no brainer but some people seem to expect otherwise.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|But this movie missed the mark for me. It wasn't a total waste of time but I could have made a betetr selection. I like Wahlberg in most anything so he was the saving grace here for me.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Enjoyable, of course. It held our attention, despite the length. It seems more detailed than the LOR trilogy movies. I guess that is because they did one movie for each of the LOR book, and this seems it will be three movies for the one, shorter, Hobbit book. I haven't read the book in over 30 years, but there is a lot that I don't remember from the book that is in the movie. I wonder how many embellishments or alternate tellings there are.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|Cant go wrong with this old film. It was good back then and good now. Can be too scary for yound kids though. Teens and adults will love it.
193700788X|2.0|I didn't realize this was the last book until I read the entire thing. To be honest the last 3-4 books have been so terrible I am not surprised this is how it ended. It didn't even really fit with the rest of the series. I'm pretty bummed about this.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Tale of tsunami survivors and what they went through to get their family reconnected through a terrible tragedy. This is a good movie and well worth your famil's movie night.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is easy to learn, but it's hard to master.  You have to get all of the puddings together without sliding them off the screen.  There are different puddings that have different abilities and you will use them all to help the puddings take over the world
0345529057|5.0|This series is brilliant! Mr. Martin can obviously create a world and tell an enthralling tale within it. The quality of the books themselves are fine. The price for this set cannot be beaten!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is a awesome hope you like this game it so great and I like the new obstacles buy it.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Admit it fans.....you went to iTunes ( or to the store) as soon as 6/11 dawned. I know I did because I previewed the album on iTunes 1 week before release. One thing about these songs.....Your going to go \\" man I heard this before\\". Correct....because Rick Ruben made the crew listen to their first 4 albums to get a certain feel. And the residue from those albums reside here....with some afterburner! You are going to hear some originality on each track...but then the tempo  shifts...Only one problem is that Bill Ward decided not to participate due to contract problems. They got Brad Wilk ( from Rage Against The Machine fame)  A really great album....and catch them on the tour!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Gives good background to the two-day fasting system. Succinct,yet gives all the information needed to start the program,plus a few recipes to get you started.

B009GN6DT4|1.0|this is the first time we have used Amazon streaming.  We have had netflix for years, but I wanted to try buying this movie for my kids. the first time they started to watch it worked fairly well but the streaming stopped a few times...but the next day when we tried to finish the last 20 minutes of the movie...it was horrible. we eventually gave up watching and now I feel like I was sort of ripped-off. I can't return it..but it doesn't work.  We went back to streaming with netflix and won't bother with amazon again.
034580404X|4.0|I read the Fifty Shades trilogy on the advice of my agent - to get in touch with my 'feminine side'.<br /><br />It would have been interesting to see if the trilogy could have been written as one powerful book. Ana's journey seems equal to Christian's, and I think deconstructionist critics could do well to examine her as a character/narrator.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I don't want to blow the story line for anyone, but after all &#34;we&#34; have been through, this left me pretty &#34;flat&#34;.  I guess Charlaine Harris wanted to leave it &#34;done&#34; as in &#34;not wanting to ever read this again&#34;, she managed that.  After reading this, I don't really care to hear about Sookie/Eric/Bill/Sam again.  What a let down.
B004XW6AGO|3.0|When I started 1Q84 I was hooked immediately. What an interesting concept! I blew through book's one and two, however when I reached book three I was completely let down. The most anticlimactic ending I've ever encountered.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|Me and my whole family loved it. If you like action movies then you have got to see this movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are one of the most amazing books i have ever read!! I loved these books and I wish there were more hunger game books in the series.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I already have the DVD of Schindler's List. However, I wanted to buy the Blu-ray special edition too for my movie archive. There's not much to say about the movie. It's one of the best movies I have seen. Blu-ray, also makes quite a difference. If you are a movie fan, I definitely recommended.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|What a truly cool,fun & sufficiently difficult so for so gamers like me!  An absolutely killer app!  Try it out!!!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The only problem I have is that the inner flap (the one the kindle is attached to) doesn't lock into the back flap.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I hadn't read this in years...I'm sure it's buried in a box in my parents' house somewhere.  Saw the Kindle Daily Deal and couldn't pass it up.<br /><br />I like the way the Kindle Touch and iPhone app allow enlargement on a panel-by-panel basis.  This was my first graphic novel purchase for Kindle, but after this experience I'll likely buy more.<br /><br />Beware that this title won't read on the Kindle PC.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best trilogy I've read in a long time! Had me glued to it for all 3 books, Well written and interesting
B00BSO2U1Y|2.0|Gave the new Bartoli Norma a listen to yesterday. It certainly has<br />some points of interest regarding the instruments and edition but<br />there are real problems concerning the actual performance. The two big<br />problems I have are the conducting and the sound. The conducting is<br />constantly in fits and starts with sudden allegros that seem to have<br />no dramatic purpose. What's worse is that this approach makes music in<br />the opera which needs special handling e.g. the march announcing<br />Norma's arrival in Act One which can sound very Italian village<br />\\"banda\\" even more trivial and banal. The end of the Adalgisa-Pollione<br />duet at the end of Act One also sounds ridiculously fast. Needless to<br />say the big double climax at the end of the opera goes for little. In<br />my experience only Serafin and one or two others pace it so it has the<br />overwhelming effect it should have. The other problem is the sound -<br />perhaps in an attempt to make the voices sound larger than they are<br />the voices are way too close. The men don't seem too affected but the<br />sounds of both women suffer from explosive consonants and hissing \\"S's\\".<br />Of the vocal performances, Sumi Jo is easily the best and one of the<br />best Adalgisas I have ever heard. For once, the singer actually sounds<br />like a young girl rather than an old truck driver and the phrasing is<br />beautiful. Her dramatic instincts are spot on as well.<br />Bartoli sings the more meditative and gentle phrases well, so we get a<br />nice picture of the softer side of Norma. But when it comes to warrior<br />Norma or the more declamatory phrases, she has neither the weight of<br />voice, breadth of phrasing, or dramatic instincts to carry it off.<br />When she tries it, the line breaks up and gets breathy and petulant<br />sounding. The entire vocal intro to Casta Diva (Sediozose voce!!)<br />suffers from this and she just doesn't the gravitas and strength to<br />pull off the end.<br />All I can say about the bass and tenor is that one wouldn't mind<br />hearing them on a pleasant evening in a smaller Italian city or as<br />second line singers in a big one, but the singing is hardly worth<br />enshrining on recordings. The bass has a good solid middle but no room<br />at the top and an incipient wobble and the light lyric tenor is<br />perfectly ordinary in all respects.<br />The best Norma commercially available remains the 1955 Scala opening<br />with Callas, Simionato and del Monaco and the pressing to get is the<br />Divina - beautifully and correctly transferred with lavish<br />documentation
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Pretty kewl game get's a little challenging in the 3rd level, which makes it fun!! It downloaded well and the graphics are pretty good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it because you can build anything you want and craft weapons and tools and go to the nether
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I found the story to be somewhat trite and unconvincing.  For me, reading it was a waste of time, however, some of the people in my book club really liked it!  To each his own.
B00B935SUY|5.0|If you are like me and love to hear rock musicians talk about music you will love this documentary. It provides a cross sectional view of the many aspects of music creation, production and the music industry as it was and is.

B00CL0J99K|1.0|This was definitely the worst movie out of the 3. A big waste of time and money. Not worth paying for.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|We always watch this when it is on TV. So we just decided to buy it. Now we can watch it anytime we want a chick flick.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This is not a book you will proclaim to be the best you've ever read. But it will make you smile, and probably cause wry amusement at the never-ending machinations of governments the world over. No one escapes Jonasson's lampooning wit. And while the plot is fanciful and ridiculous, it achieves its purpose - a satirical examination of self-important government officials and their often dunderheaded, frequently evil actions.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I read the first two books of the series and was very much anticipating the third book in the series.  However, it was EXTREMELY disappointing.  There was VERY little to the plot, character development, and the worst part was that there wasn't a conclusion to any aspect of the story.  In reading online blogs Sylvia Day is creating this series to be a 5 book series.  It's a shame - because it could have been a GREAT 3 book series.  I've read a lot of her other books and have enjoyed them - just very disappointed in this one.  It is a plot you may expect from a free/$0.99 book...but not from Sylvia Day or a book that costs $10 for a kindle book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this. I downloaded it after reading Hunger Games(I didn't see that movie) I am now reading the third book. Really enjoyed this series.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written and a stark and blatant story about Nazi Germany. It wakes you to the horrors of that awful time in history.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Nice portable way to play, to bad it doesn't have all the options & features of the full computer version.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for the new season to come out late fall. This is a great series and full of twist and turns toward the end of the season.
B0061S073A|3.0|It does what it says. More control options would make it much better, like website filtering. THat would bump the score up a lot.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|This is a great movie that explores how Gandhi became known world-wide, what he stood for and how he brought India together to rise up and claim their freedom from British control. The movie Gandhi tells a story about patience, courage and non-violence.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Saw a few review of people who are older enjoys the game and so I thought what the heck, it's free and I love the movie. The game is very cute and very well put together and you learn a few things about the underwater world of the ocean. I'm on level nine right now and I can't wait to see the other characters join Memo, Marlin and Dory. It's a good relaxing kind of game, kinda like taking care of the ocean. Get it, it will be worth it :)
0316120405|4.0|There is a visible difference between Connelly's earlier and latest books, which is understandable considering the path of an author who is more and more professional as he writes more and more books. The Black Ice has some roughness, and could be polished a little further, but it's not that distracting.<br /><br />The Harry Bosch figure is quite original. He had sad childhood, and he had dark war experiences, which gives an additional layer to his character. He is the type who does what is right even if he has to go against administration procedures or direct orders from his superiors. It makes him bigger than life. He also have good instincts.<br /><br />The Black Ice is a classic \\"cop chase the trail and get the bad guy\\" kind of book. Bosch does a lot of investigating and thinking, and there is less fight than in a fast paced action story. There is the \\"final battle\\", though. I liked it, because it seemed real, not like the exaggerated and unbelievable Hollywood actions.<br /><br />I liked the dialogues. They were sometimes grammatically wrong, but this is how real people often talk. Right to the point, without the garnish.<br /><br />The final twist is a good one. If you think it through after finishing the book, you can see the hints. I did not guess the end until the well placed final clue. But then, there was still a final twist.<br /><br />If you like detective stories, and you want a few hours entertainment, I recommend this book.

B00CRXJWZC|5.0|After I got addicted to this series on Netflix, I purchased Season 8 here on Amazon (since they only go up to season 7 on Netflix). This series is hilarious and the characters are well played. Usually with a series like this, they try to exchange the actors or the actors quit before the end, but I was very surprised that they didn't do this, the contracts for the actors must have been spot on. The last season is schedule to start around late 2013. And honestly I can't wait. It's a wonderful series with decent playback quality from Amazon. This series is LEGEN.... wait for it.... DARY!... :)
0739352962|3.0|Was looking for a smaller audio format but CD was all that was Available.<br />The single person doing all of the characters is a bit ambitious and somewhat distracting, but probably the only practical way to bring all of the books and characters together at a reasonable production cost.<br />I do applaud the effort on his reading.<br />The CD's are without track listings on my player screen for each section. Makes it difficult to return to a passage to review.<br />Over all I'm pleased to have the books in audio format but i think, random house might have done better for the price they ask.<br />Considering the cost, it was a bit much, but to the authors credit the story is exceptional and well worth the time invested to listen and learn from the lessons to be gleamed from the narrative. Peace / Kyrie Eleison - vOz<br /><br />Additional Comments:<br /><br />After having this Collection and listening at length to the cd's, I have come to appreciate Roy Dotrice's talent in doing all the voices. It truly is an achievement of merit...<br /><br />Peace / Kyrie Eleison - vOz
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I just finished reading this booking and I was so disappointed with the ending. Seriously! How can you end a book like that? I definitely did not see any development besides them getting \\"married\\". Can these people catch a break already? Can they live happily ever after? We get it they like to make love but does it have to show up on EVERY SINGLE PAGE? It just feels so unrealistic. Their entire relationship feels unreal. I feel they are not going to be a successful couple because they rely on sex to be close to each other. I agree with the other reviewers that there is definitely a lot of \\"fluff\\". Eva is a married woman now and she still wants to live with her room mate... really? Come on - grow up! Gideon needs to put his foot down! It is totally ridiculous how this story has evolved - actually it hasn't evolved. I felt this entire book only took place within a month. I want progression between these two characters.<br /><br />Eva and Brett is ridiculous - why does she have feelings for him? Why does she continue to accept his invitations when you are in love with Gideon???<br /><br />Gideon and Corinne - Why does he continue to pay her mind? She's married and he loves Eva. COME ON!!!<br /><br />Ugh, rant over. All this anticiaption for nothing. The book definitely made me hot(and that's why it got 3 stars) but that's about as far as it went. Disappointed in the ending and the entire plot and \\"fluff\\". Sylvia you can do soooo much better than that. I'm a huge fan but don't write these novels just to gain extra funds.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I loved the continuing story and the ending left me with a smile on my face. Definitely worth watching! I wish they'd do more!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but I don't know what happened to it but it glitched when it automatically updated from the Tokyo edition to the Miami edition on my HD. Now all of a sudden it can't connect to my Facebook account  to play with my friends when it worked perfectly in the Tokyo edition. PLEASE fix this ASAP! I'd hate to stop playing the game just because it doesn't connect anymore.

0525425772|5.0|John Grisham is best known for his fictional adult books about lawyers. But he has strayed away from that market on more than one occasion with a few other books for adults, as well as his Theodore Boone series for kids, of which this is the fourth.<br /><br />A group of people are pushing for a highway relocation that will move the freeway away from going right through the middle of Strattenberg, where Theo lives, and reroute it around the west side of town. This will ease traffic congestion downtown, make the route shorter for truckers to get their goods from one end of town to the other and provide jobs for hundreds of people. The politicians, big business owners and truckers are all for the new construction.<br /><br />On the surface, it sounds like a good idea. But of course, there are problems with such a grand scheme. For starters, the price tag is 200 million dollars. That's a lot of money. Part of the money will come from federal and state coffers, but a big part of it will be picked up by taxpayers in Strattenberg. That wouldn't be so bad except the city has already had to make huge budget cuts --- such as laying off city workers and teachers --- just to make ends meet. Also, the new highway will go right through a very rural, scenic area. This part of town is home to farms and campgrounds. And the new highway will run within a few hundred yards of a nearby elementary school, dangerously close to the playground there, as well as through part of a relatively new soccer complex on the outskirts of town.<br /><br />Of course the highway project is big news. It's being talked about on local radio and TV stations, and there have been numerous articles about it in the newspaper. Theo is aware of what's going on, but at first he isn't really concerned about the new traffic project. He doesn't really see how it will concern him.<br /><br />But when he finds out that a farm --- one that has been in his friend's family for generations --- will be totally flattened, that the town's water supply will be threatened, and that the children on the school playground will be bombarded with noise and air pollution, he starts to think that maybe the project isn't such a good idea after all.<br /><br />After his dog is attacked by some over zealous surveyors hired by the state, who trespassed on his friend's land, Theo decides to join a group of concerned citizens in the town who are against the highway project. He becomes an activist. He goes up against the big guys in an effort to shut the project down.<br /><br />As always, Grisham's books are entertaining as well as informative. Readers of this book will learn about the legal concept of eminent domain as well as what it's like to battle big interest groups.<br /><br />A good read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Christine M.

0312641893|5.0|I read this book because of a recommendation from my school librarian, and found it wonderful!<br /><br />Regardless of whether this book appears on lists about \\"If you like the Hunger Games, you'll like...\\", it really isn't a dystopian.  There is a monarchy system of government in this book, not a dictatorship, and it isn't totalitarian, at least from what I could tell.  In fact, the prince, Kai, is Cinder's love interest.  This book is futuristic, maybe you would consider it post-apocolyptic because the society has been rebuilt after a World War IV, but not dystopian.<br /><br />That being said, I really liked the world building.  Not all the vocabulary is the same as ours, and the author allows the reader to figure out what things mean through inference.  For example, a portscreen seems to be our equivalent of a smart-phone or maybe tablet.  The text never says that it is a phone, but you could infer that.  I really enjoyed this approach to the world building.  Perhaps some people would find it annoying or confusing, but I feel it made things more realistic.  In addition, I could visualize the palace, the market, Cinder's work space, and so on very clearly.<br /><br />I liked Cinder, as well as the minor characters of Iko, Prince Kai, etc.  Both Iko, and Cinder as well, would use sarcasm from time to time, which often added humor to the story.  Prince Kai was a nice person, but had his share of self doubt/ flaws, and I definitely liked his character.  Even though the characters were well done, I hope to see even more development in the later books in the series.  Lavanna wasn't the strongest villain, and she was all bad and didn't have layers.<br /><br />That takes me to the fact the series is more than three books! Yay!<br /><br />The pacing was very wonderful, and I was able to get lost in the story.  In fact, I had an competition coming up the next day that I was worrying about, and Cinder was able to get me so absorbed that I stopped my fretting while I was reading it.  It is a fairly long book, but I was able to get through it quickly.<br /><br />The plot was a bit predictable, but it is a re-telling of Cinderella, so things are bound to be sort of predictable.  However, it still had many major changes from the story of Cinderella, so there is still some surprise.<br /><br />If you enjoy fairy-tale retellings, you will most likely find this book good, as well as science fiction fans.  I have read Scarlet, and am looking forward to Cress and Winter!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is the type of book that grabs you from the start.  Well written, with the characters developed so well that you feel that you know them. I was riveted by the action. The writing is top notch and kept me reading. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book
B003TSEEDY|5.0|i would recommend this to anyone. It is a great story that anyone can relate to. Everyone remember their time as teenagers. This story is just about that.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was a great read!  From the beginning to the end it kept my attention and I didn't want to put it down!  The ending was superb!!!  It was one of those books that you think about for days after you finish reading it!  I have already recommended it to my book club.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Production values help to create fully developed experience into the past. Well developed character and well acted.  I would recommend this to most anyone but those who do not like the nudity and sex used in the productions.
B001NA6096|2.0|Ethan hawke puts me to sleep Pseudo intellectual talks much says nothing<br />What else is there to say not good
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Production values help to create fully developed experience into the furture. Well developed characters and well acted.  I would recommend this to most anyone but those who do not like the violence in the production.
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|Just really like this band, and I think that more music like this needs more radio play and I like the sound.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|It's a lame attempt at social commentary, but falls flat because it a story that's already been told.  Obnoxiously wealthy guy changes his spoiled ways and tries to make good by eliminating the bad in his tiown.  It's Batman with a new cast.
B000021XR5|5.0|I had the album when It came out, I misplaced it and wanted to put it back into my collection. Great songs.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|Nicely written screen adaption of the age old fairy tale with a few new twists.<br /> Good for old kids and adults.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|Just really like this band, and I think that more music like this needs more radio play and I like the sound.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I have it installed on several devices. Great to have available while awaiting for someone or something.<br /><br />Easy to pick up where I last was!<br /><br />Great stories.
B000001FSU|4.0|I had the album when It came out, I misplaced it and wanted to put it back into my collection. Great songs.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|I was an English major, so I don't like shallow characters and simplistic plots. After six seasons, \\"Doctor Who\\" continues to surprise and entertain me.<br /><br />I found out about Doctor Who about a year ago and started watching at season 1, episode 1. At first it was a little weird (that's the episode with the homicidal mannequins) but within a few episodes it got really good.
B00009L1UP|4.0|I had the album when It came out, I misplaced it and wanted to put it back into my collection. Great songs.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I haven't played the game yet but when I was looking at this I saw the number and I am very superstitious and I had to get it to a different number.
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|My boss at worked, played a couple of tracks, and started hearing it on a radio station, so I wanted to add it to my collection.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I haven't finished this book, so I guess I'd have to say that it just isn't gripping to me. Somehow it seems repetitive, not really developing. I hadn't realized it's meant to be for young people, which I am not.  It doesn't have nearly the depth of a book like, &#34;The Hare with Amber Eyes,&#34; which I loved. Reading the latter was a rich experience-- the former is not.
B009CGGCSC|5.0|Meryl Streep! That's all you have to say. Great movie. Wish I could vacation there. Most like musicals to enjoy.
B00932AA5G|5.0|This is a 5-star movie for me even with English subtitles.  The story, plot, casts, execution, etc. were excellent.  I can watch this movie over and over and not tire of it.  I've watched this many times over at Netflix and I've watched it here at Amazon twice as of this review.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|This was another good die hard movie. Worth the watch but not my favorite out of them all. I like \\"live free or die hard\\" the best so far
B008FWHGYS|5.0|I like the movie. I've watched this movie more than 4x and I still enjoy it.  I can watch this over and over and not get tired of it.  The choices you take in life will always lead to an outcome or result which you might like or dislike.  That's what I think the \\"360\\" title means or represent, which is a good title.  I was looking for movies under \\"Horror/Thriller\\" in Amazon but I don't see anything in the movie that places this movie in this category.  Even if the story line goes from one character to another it was not confusing, it all comes together in the end. Light drama I should say.  Entertaining.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|AND THE MOUNTAINS Echoed  is magnificent !  I was enthralled,saddened ,enlightened and touched  from the beginning until the wonderful end.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|This is compelling reading as all Le Carre is. I'm not sure it's his best, but it does a very good and believable job of explaining what our &#34;secret agents&#34; are doing today, and these deeds are every bit as chilling as anything LeCarre has written about in the past.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I really liked this book.  At first it seemed a bit disjointed until I got the hang of how the author was working it.  The movie is out now with Brad Pitt.  That I'm not so sure about.  Brad Pitt?
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|WOW - I was hoping to see this movie one day, too. Due to Disneys GREED, I will go without for a while  -<br />  - at least until the 3D version is around $15.00 or less.<br /><br />Very stupid marketing, Disney.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great app graphics r good the levels are tough but you still are able to get through them.  I like the Fox bags of info given in between levels. Reminds me of saving private Ryan.
076781326X|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I hadent seen it since it came out in 1968, but when my Great Nephew was going to play the lead in a school play, I found it on Amazon and ordered it.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Doodle Jump is definitely a classic in the app world.  While the game mechanics are simple (jump from platform to platform), it's still addicting and the replay value is really high.  Add in power-ups and different worlds and it only gets better.  Graphics are good as well and plays like a quality app should.  I can't comment on the problems some had while playing on their Kindle Fire, but it works perfectly on my Android phone (HTC One).  Doodle Jump is simple enough to instantly pick up and play, but also challenging enough to not get boring or repetitive.  It's a solid game and certainly doesn't disappoint.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Magnificent disc, nice booklet inside.<br />I'm a Daft Punk fan, not the best disc ever but has its own merits.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Bryson's work, good writing in general, and/or travelogues. The language is lively, and Bryson puts the reader in his hot and dusty shoes as he ambles through a place most of us will never see. Terrific read!
1401235425|5.0|I'd been meaning to read this for a while now, and having just finished it last night, I'm kicking myself for waiting so long.  This is some of the best comic writing I've come across in the past couple of years, and by far the best from DC.  I've kept up with a few other New 52 titles (Green Arrow, Justice League, Batgirl, Green Lantern Corps, Animal Man, Superman), but this is surely the leading title of the reboot so far as I can tell.<br /><br />The art is smooth and perfectly emotive throughout all seven books.  The writing is crisp, and firmly in the tradition of classic Batman noir style.  Perhaps the highlight for me is The Court of Owls, which is one of the most creative, sinister, and genuinely frightening group of villains I've come across in comics of late.  Best of all, Snyder imagines a mythology for them that perfectly compliments the Batman universe, and one that will surely add to the legacy of the title.<br /><br />Bravo to all in involved, and highly recommended on my part.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Was a little disappointed in this game. I guess I had heard so much hype about angry birds that I expected more than sling shooting birds.
1623420148|5.0|4.5 Stars<br />~Reviewed by SUZANNE & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />This was a really good book that made an old and worn plot seem sparkling and new ~ Under the Covers<br /><br />Drew Evans is handsome and rich with the ego and arrogance to match his success, women flock to him and he has no desire to give up his playboy lifestyle. Not even for Katherine Brooks, the new associate and the woman he can't seem to stop thinking about. The flu is the reason he is at home on a seven day ice-cream bender, not that she has picked someone else over him...<br /><br />Is anyone else sick of all the millionaire playboy heroes who unexpectedly fall head over heels against their better judgement? I know I am, they seem to be sprouting up everywhere, you think you have finally read them all and another one pops up. Well....I think you should try one more, I swear it's the last one! Tangled was fun, sexy and a little bit different from your usual contemporary romance.<br /><br />I have seen a lot of well deserved positive reviews for this book, but as always I like to be contrary and found that it actually took me a good 20% before I warmed up to the Drew, which been as the whole book is told from his perspective made the first part of the book a little slow for me. But once I had softened towards him I found I couldn't put the book down, I just wanted to see what hilarious and outrageous thing that Drew would say/think next.<br /><br />The romance itself was pretty hot, yet also incredibly sweet as we watch Drew fall in love with Kate without realising it is happening, and although the events in the book were predictable it didn't stop me from reading eagerly on to see how Drew would handle it.<br /><br />This was a really good book that made an old and worn plot seem sparkling and new and I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see what Emma Chase has in store for us next.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|In classic Pixar/Disney style, Wall-E is poignant, funny at multiple levels (children will laugh at the cute humor, adults will laugh at the dark, hidden humor).  The animation is gorgeous and the story line is adorable.  Worth watching over and over and buying if you haven't already!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is great I can't wait until the next book and I hope it want be long for it come out either. I love this book and couldn't get enough of. All the twist and turn that keep you glue to the book. A must read!!
076781214X|3.0|Turned out to be full screen. They didn't state the aspect ratio in the description. would have preferred widescreen version.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  It's one of those &#34;I'm going to play just one more and then I'll quit&#34;  &#34;repeat&#34;  &#34;repeat&#34;  &#34;repeat&#34; I love it.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Good movie to watch online.  Believable mother/son duo.  Wasn't quite as funny as I thought it would be, but good anyway.
B004B63M1S|4.0|if you like ridiculous violence and racist stuff in yur movies, then this is for you. I think Danny Trejo is terrific.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I use this on my Macbook pro when running a chartplotter.  It's a secondary navigation unit for my sailboat, but it works great and was really cheap.
B0095P33IW|5.0|This is not to be mistaken for the previous attempt. That movie had all the bads that could have ended up in this movie (but, thankfully, did not): script, plot, costuming, and acting. This movie has everything that the comic book geek could hope for: A believable hero, a beautiful heroine, and a gruesome bad guy. The dialog was easy on the ears. The action was great. And you were rooting for the hero by the end of the movie. Not to mention, it is a great platform for the Avengers to launch from. Give it a watch! I don't think you will be disappointed.
B004LROMWU|5.0|This is a terrific series.  I have watched every episode since the first one aired 2 years ago.  If you like sci-fi movies, namely aliens then this series is a must see.  Excellent storyline, and both action and drama filled.  If you need constant action in your shows, then this might get slow for you, but if you can appreciate action followed by a dramatic bit of storyline, followed by action again, then this series is excellent.  Beware though, you will most likely get sucked into the series!
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the story itself, but the author's style leaves something to be desired for me. I can't say the style isn't complex enough, because I really enjoy books by other authors that are targeted towards a younger crowd an is book is. So while I have found that Jodi Picoult is good at coming up with inspiring and touching stories, I think she is terrible at telling them.
B0035HKWM6|4.0|I really enjoy this movie, but it is a bit outdated as far as special effects go.  If you are more interested in the newest things then this movie might be more of a joke to you.  However, if you are a Jim Carrey fan, this is a great movie, very funny, and fun to watch.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Darn that game is so fun and if you play it, it looks like team fortress 2. And you are from WW2. I recommend you to get it!!!!! Get it right now!!!!!! ( attention: you need gameplay account first to get online, or Facebook) get it right now!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CFYD682|5.0|This is not a record you expect from someone who has been in the music business for thirty years. This is not a bunch of covers.  No safe, tired, middle of the road songs.  'the minutes' is a grand return to Alison Moyet's electronica days and the material is fresh and exciting and the best part is it's a complete album meaning every song is just as great as the last one.  I can't remember the last time that happened with a record I bought and I would be hard-pressed to single out my favorites!  Always known for her unique voice, I can tell you Alison has never sounded better in my opinion.  So if you're a long-time fan or just looking for something new then give the minutes a listen.  You won't be sorry!
B000005RDY|5.0|Got what i wanted, when i wanted it, and in the shape i wanted it in. Thank you very much.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|It was spot on in naming what my personal traits were. The information was helpful and my wife got a kick on how accurate it was. The information on how to maximize my strengths was mildly helpful. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to find any tips on maximizing their productivity a little more.
0425263991|5.0|I'd have to argue (okay, it's an argument with myself so obviously I'm right regardless) that this is by far one of the best in this series.  I'd have said that Lucas and Sasha were my favorite couple in this series - I've had two copies of their book and I've read it countless times.  Hawke and Sienna were good, but still not on the level of Sasha and Lucas.  But the couple in this book?  Absolutely, freaking amazing.<br /><br />I had purchased this as an ebook, but I'm going to end up buying a real copy.  I want to be able to flip the pages and re-read my favorite parts with ease.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to be read as part of the series.  Mainly because it answers so very many questions and you might be scratching your head just a bit (okay a lot) if you do not know the world that has been built.  It is definitely worth reading the other books.<br /><br />I could totally gush some more, but I promised myself that I wouldn't do that.  Nor would I spoil anything.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I liked the book but wanted the story line to go a little more. I want Eva to be stronger. I overall really like the book and will look forward to the next one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't know what the problem is... mine hasn't updated yet! I play on kindle fire it hasn't updated to 0.7.1 yet!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|For all of you debating to get this JUST GET IT ALREADY ITS GREAT but b warned Amazon's updates are slower than crap
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. The aircraft are realistic and it is a great way to pass time. I thought it was hard at fist and almost stopped playing it because I didn't know how to get the enemy aircraft in front of me. Once I figured out that you just turn your plane on its side the go in a circle until they get in front you it got allot easier and more fun. Just keep the grund in site and roll it on the side and they will appear.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie will make the whole family want to watch it again and again. It brought tears of laughter to my eyes and almost made my cry at the end. Good plot line, voices fit characters perfectly and animation is as always, amazing. Sound track is not that bad either.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I enjoyed the series but the first novel jumps around a lot and is difficult to follow at times. word
6304698798|5.0|WOW, This movie is amazing. Its rare in 2013 to find a movie that will actually have screen shots longer than 2 seconds and a plot line that sucks you right in from the beginning. Great sound track and acting. Makes you understand what time was like back in those days. For those who love and appreciate a good shoot em up western film with great music, excellent screen shots and good acting, this is for you.<br /><br />&#34;You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig.&#34;

B00881VLCE|2.0|I love jigsaw puzzles and this one has many cool puzzles.  The colors are gorgeous on my HD Fire.<br /><br />Why only three stars?<br /><br />Updates wiped out all the packs I had accumulated.  Yes.  You can redownload them but it's still a pain to go through ALL of my Ammy orders to remind me of all I had previously purchased.<br /><br />Also, this app contains not one but TWO different adware \\"programs.\\"<br /><br />Thirdly, I HATE that with the last update, you are MADE to either leave a review or decline to do so EVERY SINGLE TIME you open the app.<br /><br />This made me so angry, I came very close to deleting the app and leaving a one star, scathing review.<br /><br />Hopefully now that I have been nagged into leaving a review, this screen will be eliminated.<br /><br />You know what? Just writing about this, I'm angry enough to lower my rating to two stars.  Not three as originally stated.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My 4 year old son loves this watch.  He is a huge Lego fan and refuses to take this watch off.  The quality is surprisingly higher then I expected for a plastic watch.  My son puts this thing through its paces, in the pool, bath tub, sand box, you name it.  Rinse it off and it comes out clean every time.  For the price I am very happy, and my son is too.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|I've been a fan since LIFE FOR RENT. Similar but a bit different. Give it a little time to grow on you and if you liked LIFE FOR RENT you will most likely like this too.
0262731541|5.0|Bicycling science is a ultra comprehensive book on all things cycling. Its a good balance between technical information and layman's terms, anyone with a science background will love the data and formulas, others may get a bit left behind.
0151008116|4.0|This was a good read, for me though it didn't get interesting in tell after the first 100 pages, I really liked the rest of the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|needs the 0.7.0 update that iphones have... u cant join anyone on the 0.7.0 pe if u have a 0.6.1 pe
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|There is no doubt that this is a very good product for camera's weighting more that 12.9 oz. / 365g. I have a Canon Vixia HF M40 and could never get it to balance perfectly. The problem I found is you can not find the correct weight combination with the options they give you. Either it's going to be too heavy or too light. Unfortunately if you order it be prepared to keep it or sale it on ebay because you can not spend a day or two trying to get balance it and assume you can just return it, because the return policy is almost non-existent. So please beware, no matter what someone may tell you or what video you might review, you will not be able to achieve perfect balance with any camera under Approx. 33.5 oz. / 950g.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|These sounds on this app are really beatiful and soothing to my ears.  I never have nightmares again,after using this app.

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Imagine, being able to hear previously unreleased (new) music from Jimi Hendrix!  The version of Hear My Train a Comin' is worth the price of the CD.
B002QS1O36|5.0|One of my favorite movies, I love to watch it from time to time with different languages. It is a master piece.
B0094M2ITG|3.0|The best part about this movie is the son's re-evaluation and re-discovery of his father as a man and not just the old storyteller he learned to dispise. Enjoyable.
0312330537|5.0|I want to start this review by saying that I have visited India in the past, and never really quite understood the allure. I was quite young at the time (21) and my world was very small. I was frightened by what I saw on the streets and could never quite process it until....I read this book (at 43). It took me 20 years and 900 pages, but I think I understand now. The author of this novel painted an accurate and compelling picture of the chaos and clashing cultures in India. But the most important thing he did was provide meaning and understanding into how it all works there, and why some people are so drawn to the country.<br /><br />This was not an autobiography, but clearly is based upon several of the author's amazing life events. Whether everything is true or not, is in no way important. It is a brilliantly written book. The characters - so many of them - are delivered to the reader on a platter. You know all of these people in the book, and you know them well. You feel pain when bad things happen to them, and happy when good things come their way. The reader, throughout the book, is always right there on the ground with the characters. It is almost as if you are a bird sitting on their shoulders.<br /><br />There is a lot of philosophy in the novel. I am not big into philosophy, but I do not think you can write a novel about India without digging deep. I try to avoid long reviews, but felt this one deserved more than others. It is truly a remarkable book. The characters, plot, setting, pacing are all there. I think that if you know about Indian culture or have visited the country, this novel might mean more to you.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I am glad this series has come too an end-I enjoyed it very much and looked for the next book too come out-But the last book was predictable and lacked excitement-It was time for this series too end with fond memories!
0312427573|5.0|I just read a fantastic book ([[ASIN:0982253532 Hawaii: A Novel]]) where the author does an amazing job of getting into the heads of his ambitious and flawed human characters in a sweeping tale about greed in the Aloha State--a development deal where a Chinese billionaire wants to build a casino down the road from the Mormon church.  The author says in his acknowledgements that he was basically trying to write a \\"Tom Wolfe\\" book about Hawaii, and the book was even called \\"our Bonfire of the Vanities\\" in the Honolulu Weekly, so I went back and re-read Wolfe's book to see what the author was talking about, and thank god I did!  I used to think that your point-of-view characters had to be sympathetic people you could root for, but Wolfe provides this amazing narrative stance that gets you inside the heads of his characters, but somehow hovers above them at the same time inviting us to ridicule their selfish thoughts--but ridicule them in a way where we often have to admit that we would have been thinking the same thoughts in a similar situation.  Kramer's bumbling attempts to have an affair with The Girl with the Brown Lipstick, or Sherman's attempts to justify his affair with Maria (\\"I am, after all, a Master of the Universe!  Even my WIFE would understand!\\"), or the way Wolfe arcs Peter Fallow's connection to the journalistic scoop of the century (\\"Reverend Bacon provided me with all kinds of access--I owe my success to him!\\" becomes \\"I'm a genius--of course I did this all on my own!\\")--it's incredible how just as we laugh at these idiots, Wolfe gets us to look in the mirror at the same time and admit that even though it probably wasn't as extreme as cheating on your spouse, we all spend a lot of energy making \\"justifications\\" like this of one kind or another.<br /><br />None of this speaks to the story, which is just as thought-out as Wolfe explains it in his brilliant essay, \\"Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast\\" (Yes, I went and googled that too)--a how-to that the author of \\"Hawaii\\" certainly read, too.  Basically Wolfe says, here's how you write a Dickensian book for today: research it like it's a nonfiction journalistic endeavor, come up with characters that represent your locale (Dickens's London, contemporary Hawaii, Wolfe's New York City) from Low (crumbling South Bronx--at least through the eyes of white boys like Kramer and Sherman) to High (Park Avenue duplexes, Wall Street, swank restaurants, etc.), and set something in motion with a good What If that allows you to travel through all of it in great realistic convincing FUNNY detail INSIDE THE HEADS OF THESE CHARACTERS (\\"What if the Park Ave trust fundie winds up MAYBE running over the MAYBE thug who was MAYBE going to mug him, all in the climate of race-conflict-charged 1980s New York City?\\").  I've read that some of Wolfe's later works were \\"uneven,\\" but this one, all 600-plus pages of it, is as tight as a Hemingway short story.<br /><br />Finally, yeah it's a product of the 1980s, and the whole newspaper thing now seems ancient, but none of that matters.  I'm so glad I was reminded to pick this book up again, because it's one of those you'll read again and again like every five years or so.  LOVED IT!
B006885EFE|5.0|Title says it all, I love this series!! The characters are all very well developed, the storyline is compelling, and you really get drawn in. It hits home knowing this is what my grandfather did during WWII. His unit was not featured in this, but this acts as a window into what he went through during the war. Enlightening.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like games where you can challenge yourself .....I jump from book to game and the game seems to be this....have fun!!!!!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|A real cliff hanger....can't wait for the next book in series, hard to believe how it ended.<br />Love the English style of writing.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is everything you would want for either gaming, photo editing or everyday use.  The mouse is large but fits nicely with your hand, leds look great!  the programmable buttons are great for gaming and allow for input of macros.  I would highly recommend this mouse for anyone unless you have very small hands.
B00AG297GK|3.0|I wanted to like this movie, and it does have some genuinely side-splitting scenes, but it turns into a conventional fish-out-of-water tale involving mistaken identity. Anna Faris does well among a decent supporting cast with a few unbilled cameos, and the ending has some slightly serious political overtones. However, Dictator is ultimately less than the sum of it's parts
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing! But i had to debate between 4 or 5 stars. Need more keys! Make some way for there to be more keys, or at least get a way for free keys!!!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a must read for military service members, and a rare and insightful experience for young Americans, who are all too often removed from the ravages of war and its effect on personal  and national values.<br /><br />The research work of the author is to be applauded
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|If you are hesitant to buy this mouse either because you do not know the company or you are too used to having to pay 79.99 for a quality gaming mouse then let me help you....BUY. THIS. MOUSE.<br /><br />Every button on this thing can be customized with their software. The LED logo on the mouse can be customized to virtually every known color on the spectrum if you are into that thing. The weight is nice. I like my mouse a little heavier so I have all the included weights installed into it. The tracking is great, ergonomics are great, quality is great.<br /><br />I used to have a Razer. Now I have another paper weight.<br /><br />Buy this mouse, you won't regret it.<br /><br />It's nice to find a product that is 100% the quality of a competitors product at 50% the price.<br /><br />UPDATE: 6/28/13<br /><br />The scroll wheel has started to squeak a little. Not a huge issue. Other than that, still great mouse.
B000U6BT40|5.0|It's very difficult to find science fiction that isn't drenched in blood and violence.  This series is a unique light comedy with characters that are fun to watch.  I couldn't wait for Season 2.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Well acted, shot well, and realistic. The plot is fairly straight forward - you know what you are getting. Worth a watch if you enjoy this type of film (action, aggressive, mob).
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|It is the first big fish game on my kindle,but I have played many on my computer.  It was a fun game.  Can't wait to play the next one.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|But it leaves you really hanging and wanting the continuation right now. Guess I'll really be ready for the next part!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Reading this book has me on the edge of my seat, it mystery at its best, I am so enjoying it
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book Was very good ! I read it in one day. I Loved the Characters and how they fought each other the whole way through their feelings and desires only to come to the ending which I was hopeful for but Didnt know if they would get there .
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Great for my android phone that we bought for a family member. The light will be useful when it is needed..
0425263924|5.0|I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this book! I have to admit I didn't really know what to expect having seen all the bad reviews on amazon and having had to wait so long to read this book......<br /><br />However, what I can say is that there was a ton of character and story development in this book!  I was thrilled to see Gideon and Eva talk and work through things as a couple. I found there to be the perfect amount of plot, drama and angst.  I was pleased to see all the side characters come through and help advance the storyline.  I will def say that this book left you in a good place but there are many unanswered questions which are setting up the future books.<br /><br />My hope is that we get more of Gideon's story and don't have to wait a million years to get it!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|There were literally moments when my skin would crawl with goosebumps and my heart would race. This is the most exciting of A Song of Ice and Fire. I cannot wait for the next two books, but I will probably be very upset if he kills of my characters like he's been doing all along. Other devoted readers will probably agree that you should always be prepared for someone to die.<br /><br />With that being said, I do not agree with the majority's complaints on how the book was written; many claim that it is just a collection of short stories from different characters. If you read the final note from Martin in A Storm of Swords, he explains why he ended up splitting several massive storylines into two books. ASOS focused on many Westerosi characters and ADWD returns to the characters who were neglected.<br /><br />I had so many realizations about loyalty in this book and I can finally see the entire picture coming together, or growing apart in some ways. Everything in ADWD is a plot turn and it has made me rethink who I really want to come out on top. Several characters have grown in enormous ways, while some have regressed. If you had a favorite or have been putting money on a particular house/family, you might end up changing your bet after reading ADWD, as I have done.<br /><br />Cannot wait for Winds of Winter!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|my collection is complete now. . and the price was right! I was missing just this one and hadn't had a chance to find it until now at the good price.
B003G4W49C|4.0|With the movie adaptation of Ender's Game coming out this year, I picked up the Kindle version and read it in a few days. I think I read it too fast, because the story came together quickly and the climax was surprising and sudden, and then it was over. It will be interesting to see how they do the movie.<br /><br />This book speaks to the human condition, but more importantly, to the insecurities and frustrations of childhood. The line between good and evil is blurred until the end, when Ender has a chance to redeem his past. No matter your age, I think you will probably find that your inner child reacts to this story and empathizes with the struggles of these brilliant and lonely children. At least that is the way the book spoke to me.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card's writing style leaves a lot to the imagination, so I had to exercise that while reading. He leaves a lot of description and scenery out. Sometimes it is very dialogue-heavy and reads almost like a play in some ways.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to sci-fi fans, but really anyone would enjoy the openness and easily-interpreted story of a child who is forced to save humanity.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I love to read about the kings and queens and watch a movie let me better understand the history.  The story is fascinating (every single episode), just I would like less amount of sexual scenes.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I love the CD, there isn't a bad song on it,  I miss Hawaii every time I listen to it.
1781162646|3.0|A little slow to start.  More of a coming of age story than horror especially at first.  The ending, however, was pure Stephen King at his best.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I got turned onto Season 1 of Downton Abbey on a Friday. By Sunday I had watched all of Seasons 1 and 2 and have started on Season 3! What a great program!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am in love with this series! I do wish it would just be over though now. I mean how much conflict can 1 couple have anyway... I will still read them all however despite wishing they would just live happily together. So now I wait for book 4........
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|With as much as we know about President Abraham Lincoln. This movie was incorrectly titled Lincoln. When in actuality is should more properly be named the 13th Amendment. Watch and you will see. Massively overated.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Should have been more chapters, finished in less then an hour.Cool puzzles more storylines perhaps.otherwise great graphics and cool interactions(:
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like many other reviews I have read on here I was very disappointed with this book. I was expecting a great end to a great series up to this point but was surprised to realize this book went NO WHERE!! There was just 1 love scene after another with NO plot. This book makes me not want to read the next 2 books in the series because I am so bored with it!
B00000IZOR|4.0|My daughter loves this toy!  I brought it because it reminded me of the little phone I grew up playing with and now she has the same phone and loves it just as much as I did!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|cute game, i like to play this game more than my daughter does and i like how the game follows the cartoon series
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|i was really excited on buying this book. i hated the long wait before it was released. when i read half of it, i thought that this is getting nowhere. i think the author is trying really hard to have a book 4 that book 3 has suffered. it didnt get anywhere. not sure if im going to buy book 4
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great story line.  It is getting tough to find new ideas but they had good one here.  Kids and parents both enjoyed.
B005KMX866|4.0|I like the double CD pack and am glad I purchased it.  He reminds me of Elvis and I like the songs he sings.
0465011047|4.0|This was an incredibly interesting book. It really gives a lot of insight to North Korean culture and the severity of corruption in the country. I was slightly skeptical about the book going in, as in the introduction chapters, the author makes some statements that are very religious/preachy and very pro-Bush, however upon reading the final chapters, he makes a few comments that make this point of view come full circle, and it further helps empathize with the plights of the people in these detention camps. Definitely worth reading, and quick to get through.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a fun and cool game every sense I got the game subway surfer I been playing it all the time
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Continues to be funny and invests you in the characters. Great acting and great entertainment. Looking forward to the 6th season.
0131103628|3.0|I was suprised to find this book is written to teach C programming but does not explain in depth the meaning of all the terms it just throws at you one behind the other. I wanted to see behind the scenes so to speak how such things as variable actually work at the hardware level. For me it makes learning a much greater challenge.<br />However I am glad to own this book, because it covers the subject from start to finish. It makes a good reference book.
B005D6O0IO|4.0|Nice shoes, comfortable, looks ok with jeans and/or slacks.  Nice design. Lovely options.Shoes looks and feels as expected. Highly recommended

B00992CF6W|5.0|Finally the update is hear yes I am so happy now you can spawn animals  and the multiplayer is much easier to use awsome
0425263924|4.0|I bought this using my husband's account, but I had to leave a review. I have to say this may be my favorite book in the series.  Although the end left a lot to be answered, I felt like it was heads and tales more mature than the previous novels.  In the first and second, I felt like they were mad at each other every other page. I am the kind of gal who likes to read a deliciously happy romance novel. I couldn't put down the series because of the intensity of their sexual relationship, but until this novel I constantly felt myself getting annoyed with both characters. But in Entwined, I felt like their disagreements were founded and they FINALLY handled themselves like adults in a committed relationship. I thought the writing was a step above the previous two as well. I'm excited to read the next couple.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Genius, amazing syfy. Xfiles had nothing on this show. Great story line. You have to pay attention, makes you echoed to watch the next episode.
B001NA6096|3.0|If you liked &#34;Dinner with Andre&#34; you'll like this movie...Much forgettable verbiage about love and life except that the actors are walking around Vienna all night. The actress is lively and has all of the good lines; actor/character is so low key--Hard to know what she sees in him.  More intriguing now than when it first came out (can't remember if I fell asleep or walked out) because we know there are sequels.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|Anyone who knows anything about Mickey Cohen and his role in the syndicate knows that the prefix to the title of that film that stated that &#34;this film is based on actual accounts?&#34; or some such statement was totally inaccurate. The singular accuracy was that he a Jewish Gangster. There was no mention whatsoever about Benny (Bugsy) Seigel nor was there any plausable explanation of what the wire that was referred to really transmitted. Beyond that, if you like shoot-em-up gangster movies, I'd give 2 stars at most. sms

1490313370|4.0|Choose Yourself is a very easy book to like. His insight about the changing nature of work and the economy seem right on to me.  While some sections of the book wander a bit for me I couldn't help but enjoy the ride because James Altucher's writing is so crisp and stylish. His wryness, humor, and playful crankiness comes through in a lovable way. So while I might quibble about some philosophical points being \\"wrong\\", ultimately the book is a very generous offering from James that maps out some mindsets and approaches that have worked for him to get through innumerable failings and periods of self doubt. He unfailingly shows us his guts and his humanity. I live in NYC where the author lives and I found myself wishing to chat with about sections of his book.<br /><br />While I don't think this book is a panacea that will solve all your problems it is a book to disrupt your habitual ways of thinking about yourself and things in your life you contend with.<br /><br />I am grateful to James for having written it. There is a strong chance you'll enjoy it and get something from it as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|SUPER GREAT GAME! I haven't run into any trouble so far. My only wish is that gems were easier to come by.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|There aren't many bands that get back together after several decades and succeed in recapturing in new songs the elements that made them successful in the first place - in fact, I can't think of any band that's done this (Led Zeppelin's 2007 reunion did, but with old songs). So, one of the first things Rick Rubin did when he got Black Sabbath together was to play them their first album, presumably in the hope that they could recapture the vibe that basically invented heavy metal. The good news for Sabbath fans is that they've come pretty close on what may be their last album. On a mix tape/playlist, the songs on 13 would sit pretty comfortably alongside the first four Sabbath albums - especially Black Sabbath and Paranoid. Songs on 13 are mostly medium-slow tempo and, with one exception, very heavy and unmistakably Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Rick Rubin should be congratulated for bringing out the best of these metal legends. Tony Iommi overcame his cancer treatment to prove he's still the riff-master, and I think his solos throughout the album are especially tasteful - no notes are wasted. Geezer Butler is still a monster on bass, as anyone who's seen him live recently would attest (Ozzy Osbourne gives him the highest compliment in the liner notes). Ozzy himself doesn't reproduce any of the high-pitched screams of the early days; rather he sticks to a lower register that would make it possible to reproduce these songs live during the current tour. Finally, while I'm sad to see Bill Ward didn't make it this far, Brad Wilk (Rage Against the Machine) fits in perfectly - 'surprisingly well' according to Geezer in a Guitar World interview - and he doesn't try to be too fancy or too heavy. Here's my subjective song-by-song breakdown of 13. I don't claim it's right or that everyone will agree with me, but it's how I feel about the songs after a handful of listens.<br /><br />End of the Beginning: I didn't warm to this song instantly, though it's the second `single' from thealbum and they've played it live already. The simple opening riff reminds me of the opening to their self-titled classic - like a tolling bell and the fast section of the song - from the 2:20 mark is awesome. 7/10<br /><br />God is Dead: this conveys a sense of menace from the get-go and I love the lyrics too. In fact I love everything about this song - Geezer's bass work near the end is fantastic. And it's not anti-God, so stay cool in the bible belt. 9/10<br />Loner: a bit more uptempo and more good lyrics. Teenage angst written by musos in their mid-60s - it shouldn't work. 8/10<br /><br />Zeitgeist: This track starts with some manic laughter from Ozzy (is there any other kind?) and quickly settles into a spaced-out vocal accompanied by faint guitar and soft drums ..... Yes, this is Planet Caravan part 2, complete with another trans-galactic space travel lyric. This is another classic for laying back with the lights out with a drink or smoke of choice. I'm glad they included this softer track, just like those early classic albums. 9/10<br /><br />Age of Reason: A killer track. Just a hint of an old song in one of the riffs (is it Hole in the Sky?) but just a hint - and it's a good thing. And the lyrics sum up all the troubles of the world in three verses - 'sustainable extinction, a fractured human race'. More teenage angst. Fantastic! 9/10<br /><br />Live Forever: This starts out with a great riff but I feel a bit let down by the chorus - whatever-forever, die-lie. At least it doesn't go on too long. 6/10<br /><br />Damaged Soul: Maybe this track succeeds best at time-travelling back to the late 60s. It's based on a simple, bluesey riff that reminds me a bit of latter Hendrix (the Blues album). Again, this is a good thing. 9/10<br />Dear Father: the closing song seems to be about the day of deliverance for child-molesting priests - a War Pigs for the church (Prayer Pigs?) 'Preacher of theocracy hiding your hypocricy under a false sanctity, holy phony empathy''. This song ends with the thunder, rain and tolling bells that announced the opening of the first song they wrote (Black Sabbath), suggesting that those bad priests are going down, down, down (to borrow from Tom Waits) rather than to the pearly gates. 9/10<br /><br />I recommend getting the bonus disc version if you can because those three tracks are well worthwhile. Methademic is (appropriately) the fastest song here, with Geezer's fingers and Brad Wilk's drumsticks working overtime - great lyrics and chorus too. Peace of Mind is just as good. Pariah isn't quite as good to my ears but that might be because I find the rhyming of pariah-messiah in the chorus irritating. As much as I like the first two songs, I can see why they kept them off the main album: their fast style is out of keeping with the album's medium-slow tempo (imagine sticking a 'Turn Up the Night' or 'Mob Rules' onto Master of Reality).<br /><br />So, overall this is a great, heavy Sabbath album that, surprisingly, stands up really well to their early work. Please note -I do not claim it is as good as those albums - rather that it's way way closer to them than we have any right to expect from a bunch of 65 year olds. And if it's their last they can be very proud of it. And fans can be grateful that they made it. I love it.
B000000H6Y|5.0|A must have for anybody whom appreciates dark music, Pete Steele (r.i.p) is a brilliant songwriter and his vocals are complimented well by the rest of the band...... an oldie but goodie for sure!

0515142247|3.0|The Jack Reacher books are all entertaining in different ways, and Die Trying is entertaining in a \\"meh\\" kind of way. The parts concerning hero Jack Reacher, a stoic, muscle-bound badass with little character and a propensity for pulling a win out of any situation, are as entertaining as usual. The problem with this book is how different it is from the original and the difference in style can be off-putting. Written in third person as opposed to first, each chapter jumps between a look at what's happening to Reacher and what is going on with a group of FBI agents. For most people, they read the Jack Reacher books for Reacher, not for other flimsy characters that hog half the book and help make the uninteresting plot even more unexciting.<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot of the first book as it was pure mystery, suspense, and fun. This book puts the mystery on hold and goes for a more thriller-like approach. Reacher is swept off the street with a beautiful FBI agent and taken to a backwoods city in Montana where a group of radicals are trying to break away from the US. Meanwhile, the FBI search for their missing agent and attempt to track her.<br /><br />The action is here, but it relies too much on the idea of Reacher being a great sniper, which wasn't at all present in the first book--in fact it was never even mentioned. While this is okay, it seems to just be a plot device added in to give the ending some creedence. And while the series will continue to go with the idea of Reacher being a good sniper, it just like a complete plot device here. Good suspense novels shouldn't be predictable, but after reading about these facts halfway through, you know part of how the book will end.<br /><br />This is not a bad book by any stretch. Reacher still beats the tar out of people, there is still a woman whose only purpose is a plot device and a semi-love interest. I compare Jack Reacher to a sort of hobo James Bond. He always comes out on top, always gets the lady, and he's seemingly good at doing everything. A fun read? Eh, it's alright. As far as Reacher books go, this is one of my least favorite, but it's still nothing to write off.emingly good at doing everything. A fun read? Eh, it's alright. As far as Reacher books go, this is one of my least favorite, but it's still nothing to write off.
1781162646|4.0|This is a story about a college student who takes a summer job and learns a lot about life.  This story is not scary, or sick or twisted or dirty.  It is a simple story about people and how each other intertwines with each other.  Being a King novel of course their is some spooky stuff, but all in all this is a story about people, and how lives are changed by the people in your life.  I say read it, its short and interesting and takes about 3 pages to get into it and care.  I really liked it and hated it to end.  How about a sequel, I would like to know more about the characters at Joyland, what is their backstory?  Go into the Moms life, how did she get where she is, who was her husband, lots you could read about.  Go buy this book and enjoy it.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I thought this would be great for the kids, so I downloaded it.  However, after a while of playing it myself I found it pointless and not at all fun.  It was off of my Kindle within 15 minutes.  So glad I didn't pay for it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I grew up familiar with these behaviors...and they are still there. The one thing I wish the movie had more of is one person who  practiced 'loving detatchment'...otherwise, this movie covered the whole gamete of the disease of bi-polar, and did a pretty good job pointing out a little over the top 'superstition' which was really OCD....and the ACTING (OMG-good) had you feeling you were spying in on lives. The story and the way it revealed the ups and downs (downs and ups) of bi-polar and all those codependent, brought me to giggles and tears and a side-long look to my husband, who looked back, and nodded...He knows I KNOW these characters, I love them, and just like this movie will show you, inside the wacky, is a deeply feeling heart and deserving of love and compassion just like one who is 'normal' (I chagrin saying 'normal'). And don't shy away if mental illness freaks you out. You'll learn something about being real and honest. It's a good movie for that too.
0061978078|4.0|As I expected, Pandemonium did not disappoint. The book was thought-provoking and moving in all the ways I'd hoped it would be.<br /><br />Pandemonium continues Lena's story after her narrow escape over the border and into the Wilds where she plans to build a life with Alex, her first love. But Alex, as is often the norm in young adult novels, is separated, harshly and sadly, from Lena, and she is forced to face her new life alone. Scared and filled with grief at the loss, Lena finds a place among the Invalids and tries to learn, once again, how to live.<br /><br />The most intriguing aspect of Oliver's book is the chapter divisions, which alternate between \\"then\\" when she first entered the Wilds, and \\"now\\" which is in sync with the present time. This was a very clever technique that allowed us to understand Lena's adjustment period without it being a drudgery we had to read through on our way to what really mattered: The resistance. The \\"now\\" focuses on this more important subject of the book, and introduces us to Julian Fineman who fights for his unprecedented and unadvised procedure. He and Lena are thrown into an impossible situation that forces them to work together for their own survival despite their aversion to each other. Their relationship is tension-filled from the start, for Julian Fineman stands for everything Lena hates.<br /><br />The ending was not at all surprising, but it was necessary, and it caused chills to climb my spine even with all of its predictability. It was the perfect ending, and the last page sent me running out to buy the next book right away because I just couldn't take the suspense. I HAD to know what would happen next.<br /><br />I have enjoyed this trilogy so far, and I recommend it highly. It's a fun read with a great social message besides.<br /><br />Casey Hays<br />Author of [[ASIN:0988188007 The Cadence]]
030758836X|2.0|I feel so let down by this book:(((. Loved her other books and was excited to read this new one.  Started out very promising but the ending was just terrible !!!  It was like she got bored with writing it and just gave up !<br />It will make me think twice about EVER buying her books again :((( very sad
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie is outstanding and easily in my top 10 favorite movies of all time! Kind of a low budget film but it doesn't need to be fancy graphics to have the comedy and witty humor that it has.  Nice love story behind it although highly unlikely but still funny.  The girl is smmokin hot and I hear the guy is handsome from my gf once he turns into a human.  Acting was decent for a movie like this and actor picks were solid.  Great movie all around and worth buying or at least renting!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Great game! I have played a few of these that I have quickly completed but this one was great for the money I paid.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it! If it weren't for having daily responsibilities, I probably would have finished it in one sitting. The power of the human mind and spirit is amazing.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A slow beginning as usual with La Carre but the many lines of the plot are soon expertly and elegantly woven together into a fine thriller. Granted that he is an acquired taste, it is well worth the effort to appreciate his literary gifts and penetrating insights into human nature. A worthy addition to his works. Strongly recommend.<br />  Peter Riani

B00AK57N00|4.0|I got this when it was the free app of the day.  It said it downloaded but it never did.  There may have been issues with my signal or other technical problems.  I checked my order and it said I had it.  When I checked my cloud it was there so I was able to get it down to my phone.  After playing it for one turn (3 lives) I'm hooked.  Seems realistic enough as far as the physics go.  It can live on your sd card (good) and runns pretty smoothly.  I took off a star cause it is going to be another one of those games that I get frustrated with after reaching a certain level and I will end up deleting it.

B0013WJGJ0|2.0|We LOVE getting movies through Amazon Instant Video, but this particular movie was very bad. Let me re-phrase. The move, Batman, was good and we enjoyed it. But the sound quality was like a roller coaster. It would be extremely loud, then too quiet to hear, then loud, then quiet again - all in a single phrase of a line. Don't know the deal - this was the first time this has happened to us with an Instant Video Purchase.<br /><br />As for the Movie, still what I believe is the best Batman movie. Then again, it came out just as I finished high school and it is the original in my book. Great lines. Great characters. And as my teenage kids put it, \\"Jack Nicholson does crazy better than any actor ever.\\"
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The overall message of the story was clear but hard to picture things in my head due to lack of explaining
B00992CF6W|4.0|I truly enjoy this game,  especially the multiplayer mode. Some changes have been made to it recently. I now have a bucket and the ability to chat on my tablet,  but I do not like the upcoming requirement to pay for multiplayer use. It is sad to see that something I thought I was done paying for will suddenly cost me again.
B008M0TLEG|5.0|I have these in a black pair which I bought several years ago. They fit like Crocs usually do which is loose and roomy. I just bought these in the silver/gray and they fit quite snug, not too small, but not at all loose or roomy. I wear a size 7AA, and with my narrow feet, I usually have trouble with shoes feeling a little too big, not too small. These fit perfectly without socks, and a bit tight with socks. Very cute shoes, but just a warning to size up if you are in between sizes or have a wider foot.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie is really about substance abuse and how it can destroy a person and a person's relationships.  It really isn't about flying.  The airplane crash is really just a small secondary part of the story.  Denzel Washington plays the same ol' angry character with an attitude that he often plays.  The movie is depressing and reminded me of Leaving Las Vegas, another grim substance abuse story with Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue. Skip this one and find something else.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Wasn't expecting much...it's a USB 3.0 hub... but it works really well and adds so much additional functionality to the single USB 3.0 slot on my Surface Pro.  Transfer speeds are quick and the 128GB USB 3.0 stick that's connected to it is recognized instantly. I have a mouse connected to the other slot and I have 2 free USB 3.0 slots.  It's small, out of the way, gets a little warm when transferring files or streaming movies from the stick.  It's self-powered, the cord is relatively short and robust, packs easily.  I love it.

193700788X|1.0|The real problems with Dead Ever After are slipshod writing and an all too apparent unwillingness on the part of its author to take the time to do it right.  The characters don't act like themselves.  They don't sound like themselves.  In fact, sometimes the dialogue doesn't even fit the situation.  And despite its plodding finality, Ms. Harris' book actually tells its readers very little about the fates of its characters.  In fact, there is nothing here that Sookie waking up at the start of the next book to find Eric in the shower wouldn't set right.  And that may be the author's plan.  But the book's problems are secondary to those of its writer.  Ms. Harris has not seen fit to do her customary book tours for Dead Ever After.  Why would she avoid her fans if she was, truly, proud of her latest work?  Did she expect all the negativity and, if so, why did she choose to bring it on herself?  Perhaps the answer lies in her personal life.  Has Ms. Harris suffered socially from her success?  Speaking on several occasions, she left the impression that she would have preferred that her friends and neighbors had never read her books.  And her reaction to the HBO series seems to be one of shock and dismay that her neighbors have cable tempered with vast amounts of money.  So, in a weak and ill-conceived attempt to distance herself from her own creation, she strips poor Sookie of every bit of magic in her life, leaving her worse off than when she started out.  I feel sorry for Sookie.  I can not express a similar sentiment for her author.  Authors have literary license; but only as long as the publishers and reading public are willing to renew that license from time to time.  As for Dead Ever After, it might best be renamed Dead On Delivery.
B002V092M4|4.0|This was a great read, the book is unlike the movie in as much as the book moves at a slower pace. But is far far better than the movie. The plot is a good potboiler with plenty of twists and turns to keep you fully interested in the book. The main character is George Smiley who is a retired secret service spook. There appear to be information leaks from within the secret service, so George is asked to set up a investigation run outside of the service. Well worth curling up on a wet weekend and enjoying this book
0739319175|4.0|I'm not saying that is a bad thing.  If you liked his previous books, you will enjoy this one as well.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Just finished reading this book and I expected a lot more.  I understand that there are two more books to follow, but Sylvia Day ended this one with no closure, no cliffhanger, and too many open ended issues. Honestly, I felt really irritated when I finished it.<br />Eva and Gideon are stronger than ever, which is great, and the sex was descriptive and hot, but I feel disappointed by how many leads were brought into the story. Not just that they were unanswered, as many good books leave questions unanswered, but that they were brought in and just left there. She opened up so many issues with both Eva and Gideon in this book, and then just ended it. No cliffhanger, no surprise, just boom, to be continued.<br />Seriously? Disappointing. Gave three stars because I still enjoy the characters and the storyline, even though the ending in terrible.
0062073613|4.0|\\"I'm Peter Carmody,\\" said the boy to the Police inspector: \\"Do you like detective stories? I do. I read them all, and I've got autographs from Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie and Dickson Carr and H.C. Bailey.\\"<br /><br />I can't say I agree with young Peter, though.  I don't `read them all,' speaking of detective writers. I am sure there are many other fine detective writers, but I am first and foremost an Agatha Christie fan when it comes to books in this genre. I am a bit more inclined to reach for a Poirot novel over a Marple novel, but Miss Marple's manner of speech is just so much to the point and insightful that most everything she does say (and in some works it isn't all that much) makes you stop and take notice as Agatha Christie thereby suggests that what you may have been assuming or supposing is probably all wrong.<br />The Body in the Library is a tough nut to crack and Christie has the reader going over so many possibilities herein that Christie finally has Miss Marple say rather apologetically: \\"Such curious things happen, don't they? If I were to say that this particular plan went wrong because human beings are so much more vulnerable and sensitive than anyone thinks, it wouldn't sound sensible, would it? But that's what I believe---and---\\"<br /><br />And later: \\"And if you care I'll give you a hint. The trouble in this case is that everybody has been much too credulous and believing. You simply cannot afford to believe everything that people tell you. When there's anything fishy about, I never believe anyone at all! You see, I know human nature so well.\\"  And that's what makes Miss Marple such a talented creation and \\"her novels\\" a delight to read; though, when it is suggested in this novel by a character that Miss Marple is so talented that she should write detective stories Christie has her answer: \\"Oh no, I'm not clever enough for that.\\" I suppose such is one of the few times that Agatha Christie called herself clever and talented. In the various interviews that I have heard her speak she comes off as a rather, seemingly normal, modest lady---i.e., not unlike the character of Jane Marple herself. But both ladies seem to know an awful lot about human nature.us interviews that I have heard her speak she comes off as a rather, seemingly normal, modest lady---i.e., not unlike the character of Jane Marple herself.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The ideas presented were interesting and the acting was good. The ending was satisfying and redeemed any faults of the movie.
B004TL3R24|5.0|I bought this to use with my Manfrotto 561 bhdv1 video monopod in the hopes I could make it work even though it's designed for tripods. After much trial and error I was able to use the extra panhandle screw hole on the 561's head to loop a braided steel cable to serve as an attachment point for the strap. It works and even looks ok, but it's still a homebrew rig.<br /><br />The quality of the strap is good and the price point is reasonable for a branded piece of gear like this. It probably works much better with their tripods though.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was intrigued by the story and read the first dozen chapters, but I just couldn't commit to the whole book. Instead I skipped to the last part and read the end. Just not my cup of tea.

B00847KFDS|4.0|Perfect for a road trip..turn up the volume and sign along. You already know the words. The duet with Bob Segar alone is worth the price
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|This is just not the same series. The whole feel of the book is off. Not just the POV change but Sookie isn't even in character let alone all the rest of the gang. Boring and ridiculous plot. Yes, ridiculous and this from someone that loves fantasy and has no problems with witches/fairies etc and vampires of course. The plot on offer just didn't make sense. I've stuck with Sookie all the way though, loved the first 8 books, tolerated the next few but this is just rubbish.<br /><br />I don't actually mind the HEA but I DO mind how we got there. I know it has been forshadowed and hinted at for 3-4 books but really. Sookie just doesn't think or act like that. And as for Eric, well what a way to treat such a popular character. If Sookie was off then Eric was just nowhere to be seen. I don't know who was inpersonating our favourite viking.<br /><br />Unfortunately ending on such a poor note has really tainted the whole series or me. I feel I can't recommend any of them now as I'll be setting people up for the same total anticlimax. I was actually bored reading this. If I hadn't invested so much in Sookie over the years I doubt I would have made it through. I have considered reading some of CH other works but after this I don't think I'll bother.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Still enjoy these movies. You can suspend belief and just enjoy the ride with you tongue firmly panted in your cheek.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I'm not always easy in reviews - a lot of people will give five stars just because they liked something, but I reserve five for games that really addict and challenge me.<br /><br />NOTE: I played this on my 7inch tablet; I would not want to play this on my phone, although I'm sure it's possible.  Then again, since I've gotten my tablet, I only use my phone as a phone, I can't imagine wanting to play games on it.<br /><br />So the game has several islands, and each island has a road that requires several bridges; each bridge is a \\"level.\\"  The graphics are of good quality (keep an eye out for the snowman), and the scene is shown with a grid on which you can place building elements.  Building elements need to start either at one of the anchor positions given, or continue from the ends of other building elements.  To start off with, you only have wood as building material; as you progress, you get to start using steel, concrete pillars, and suspension wires.  Each one has it's own cost structure, a base cost for one unit length plus more for each increase in length.  Wood and steal have limited lengths, the pillars and wires seem to be unlimited.  For example, you selected wood, then draw from the left anchor of the bridge across to the right; the wood will only extend to it's maximum length, then you lift your finger and the piece stays in place.  Touch the right anchor on that piece of wood, stretch it again to the right, then lift your finger to set it's position.<br /><br />Once you build your bridge, you put it in \\"play\\" mode.  That starts the physics engine, which tells you by color how much stress each element is under; too much stress causes the element to break.  If you think your bridge is worthy, you can test it out by sending either a pair of cars or a pair of trucks over it.  Ultimately, you want it to be stable enough for the trucks, so the only minor issue I have with the game is that the car test is useless since the truck test covers both testing fortrucks and cars, anyway.  I suppose if you're younger, or just not good at it, you might want to start with cars and then up the challenge to trucks, but it seems pointless to me.<br /><br />There are five achievements on each level; safe for cars, safe for trucks (the latter covering both), and achievements for building with restricted money, restricted resources, and restricted money while having an upper \\"stress\\" level on your bridge.  For example, you might need to build a bridge with under a certain amount of money where the highest stress on your bridge doesn't go over 50%.  There's a meter that shows the current maximum stress, and the coloring of the elements as they go under stress (going from green to red) shows you where the critical points are.  Sometimes the \\"restricted material\\" achievement includes other restrictions, like maximum number of pieces or maximum cost, but not always.<br /><br />You do NOT have to achieve all of these at once - you can build the bridge initially to get the first couple of badges, then make it cheap (and unsafe) to get the restricted money award, then beef it up to get the restricted stress award.  As I write this, the most helpful \\"critical\\" post says the money restrictions on some levels are \\"ridiculous,\\" they are NOT - they can be very challenging.  I did initially skip some, and finish them after completing the rest of the levels, and found that, with the extra experience, I was able to do them all fairly easily.  I did get every single achievement - it's challenging, but not ridiculously so.  Since you need only succeed in getting vehicles across to move on, you don't need to get every award to complete the map.<br /><br />I got this game for free, but having played it, I think it's easily worth the $2.00.  If there was another with different levels, I'd buy it - I was thinking about the original Bridge Constructor, but it seems like this is either a re-release of the same game, or nearly identical.  I want to make sure I have different levels.  If someone could tell me, that'd be great.<br /><br />So, point by point - the graphics were very well done, in my opinion.  I cannot rate the sound, as I almost always had it turned off.  The interface is limited by the touch screen; fat fingers mean misplaced elements all the time, but there's an \\"undo\\" button, and double tapping an element will remove it as well.  You will need to zoom in (pinch to zoom/unzoom works just fine) to make some of your trickier connections, but that's a feature, not a drawback (again, IMO).<br /><br />The game is challenging and fun, and watching your bridge disasters is as much fun as creating a functioning bridge; the way the vehicles crash is often comical and makes me chuckle... your success is determined by whether or not the vehicles make it across, and we've actually had a bridge that collapsed right at the end, but the vehicles made it across and we \\"won.\\"  It's hilarious (and very uncommon).  Both my son (14) and I greatly enjoyed this game, so I have to give it props.
B002VWOMN6|5.0|I hadn't seen Amadeus since it first came out, nearly 30 years ago.  The Blu-Ray edition looked about the same as the theatrical release, at least as I remember it, which is to say it looked fabulous.  Enough has been said about the wonderful cast led by Tom Hulce and Murray Abraham, and about writer Peter Shaffer's substitute of a moral fiction for the actual history of Mozart and Salieri.  The moral is well-taken but it's the fantastic way Milos Forman assembles a picture of 18th century Vienna and the life of its theater and concert halls, creating an environment of music-making that is absolutely plausible and delightful to experience.  The Perils of Mozart story is, frankly, a bit silly, as is the somewhat painful contrast of Salieri's life and music with Mozart's.  It's good, however, for those who don't know the difference.  Mozart, like Charlie Parker, was an absolute original.  Like Parker, Mozart thoroughly enjoyed life, pushing his enjoyment of both art and party to the extent that he probably drank himself to death, or otherwise poisoned himself with too much of everything.  The movie will introduce you to the miracle.  The story works but is the least quality of this amazing movie.

B004SIP73U|5.0|A movie we missed, though a friend was in a production of the play.  Glad we found it! The leads and support are just right, especially for anyone who is close to a parish's operations (one with a school).  The story is a familiar one, sadly, but screenwriter Shanley fleshes it out with exceptional writing.  The location is perfect, the scenes and photography well-blended without the usual peripatetic affects.  It could have been a vicious trashing of the church, but was instead an affirmation through Meryl Streep's character of what has become a very dated variety of Catholicism, one that proceeds from conviction rather than popularity.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a very good family movie.  It is very entertaining.  A movie you could watch over and over again!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Poor diction and heavy accents made hard to follow conversations. Jumping from one era to another made this movie hard to follow.  Multiple roles for cast members made it also hard to follow.  Had an interesting message that was revealed toward the end.  Was glad the movie was over when it did finally end.

0060920084|2.0|I recently set off on a cross-country trip and, at the recommendation of a friend, picked up this book to read along the way.  Having read and really enjoyed a number of Bryson's other books, this sounded like the perfect companion to my trip.  Unfortunately, it really represented a lost opportunity.  Rather than reflect meaningfully on any aspect of his travels or life and culture in America, Bryson tiresomely and repetitively marches out the same old jokes about fat people, names with potty humor and stupidity - which a 10 year old might find funny.  It might even be OK in the length of a newspaper column...but really doesn't add any value in book length.  Unlike other books in which he actually provides interesting history and cultural anecdotes and analysis, this book is just a tiresome drone across the country, where each place is exactly like every other place, except sometimes he can't understand the local dialect.  I am typically compelled to finish books - even those I don't particularly like; sometimes the endings are redeeming.  This one I really can't be bothered.  At this point, I don't believe it is worth the investment to see of the second half contains anything redeeming.

B0041T52S6|4.0|This movie pops your head off and screws it back on the wrong way. It is a total sugar rush of cartoon-y violence and true-to-the graphic novel scene transitions that make you feel like you're stuck in a new video game world that you are not yet sure how to navigate. Honestly fun to watch, and a bit exhilarating as far as jump-cuts and pixelated special effects go. And with it's excellent soundtrack, this movie is enough to make me happy and keep me coming back.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|So far so good. Having this watch for a week now and everything seems to be in order. Unlike others, I haven't ran into any problems with the time being negative or positive in minutes. The watch holds excellent time for a Malaysia automatic movement. The only cons I have for the watch is a hit on the band and adjusting the time. The stem is very stiff when setting the time (adjusted once out of box). Maybe the movement will loosen over time. The band is just cheap, plain and simply put. The [[ASIN:B000EQS1JW Citizen Men's BM8180-03E Eco-Drive Canvas Strap Watch]] has the ideal canvas strap for a watch of this style. I'm afraid the stitching on the Seiko will fail over a period of time. Only Time will tell. Keeping price in mind, this is a fantastic watch and the cons are unnoticeable. I like the watch so much my father is getting one for Fathers Day. He has the Rolex and Tag's for dress and some Luminox for everyday. He complains about the Luminox not holding great time and being on the bulky side for everyday wear. He noticed my Seiko and almost ordered one the same day, I unplugged the internet in the house. Haha! Happy Fathers Day Dad :-)

B000MCIBE8|3.0|For whatever unknown reason the original vinyl album was mastered at a slower speed and all released versions were like that for the next 40 years.  Also, this new remastered version is mixed a little brighter and with the instruments a little more forward in the mix.  This is unfortunate because these two changes detract from the mystery and strangeness that permeated the original release.  Granted that the slow speed (which resulted in the pitch being in the Key of Ab/G# instead of the Key of A)may have been a mistake, but I believe the original mastering with the reduced brightness and some instruments not so far forward in the mix was intentional.<br /><br />As for the original censored lyrics on the songs \\"Break On Through\\" and \\"The End\\" I think that is a matter of preference. Personally I feel that the censored version of Break on Through has a little more impact than the uncensored version.<br /><br />While this new remastered version provided an interesting listen it just does not have the same impact as the original release.  This would have been a better release if it included both versions.<br /><br />Note that only the original 45 RPM singles (\\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Break On Through\\") were produced at the correct speed back in 1967.

B00BSO2U1Y|4.0|Just finished listening to the new Bartoli NORMA. Being a 67 year old opera fan who has lived with  the Callas recordings my whole life and certainly never expecting their primacy on the scale of operatic greatness to be challenged in my lifetime (and maybe never), I am, as always, drawn in by the sheer beauty of Cecilia Bartoli's voice and her quite different, internalized interpretation ofthe Druid priestess. Sumi Jo as Adalgisa is radiant bringing a youthful sound to the role that is seldom there when it is sung by a mezzo whom you feel just got through with singing Sarastro in MAGIC FLUTE. When we get to the two men, they are just inadequate for the challenge. John Osborn has a pleasant enough voice that has even a caressing sound which, at the right moments, especially in his pleading with both women, appeals, but he simply lacks the heft for the more dramatic moments, something which could also be said for Miss Bartoli at times, but her professionalism redeems her as a singer and actress. Michele Pertusi has NONE of the needed power for Oroveso. The orchestra produces a quite different sound and at times,races on like we are in a great haste to finish. All in all, I rate the recording so highly because of Bartoli and Jo, but I will return more and more to the 1955 Callas recording with Del Monoco and even her 1960 one with Corelli with all of its wear on the great Callas voice. Nevertheless I am happy to own the new Bartoli recording and will find it a relaxing alternative from time to time.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|Well, as beautiful as a giant gorilla can get! Between the transfer (best this film has ever looked), the bonus features, and the book that it comes in, I cannot recommend this item enough. If you're a fan of the original 1933 King Kong, this deserves a place in your collection.
0670026603|5.0|Unbelievable book!!!!  I couldn't put it down.  Easy summer reading.  Get the tissues, cause you'll need them.  I didn't want it to end.

0670026557|5.0|I've read tons of organizational psychology books, but this one is hands down one of my favorites. Adam Grant states a concise, clear point in a very conversational tone that makes sometimes dry material interesting.<br /><br />I will say, at times, Professor Grant offers examples that are a bit far fetched and very much out of the realm of the regular individual. But, like most great reads, Adam Grant forces us to rethink/rewire how we operate at work and really begin to wonder about situations that seemed quite clearly 'zero-sum' before reading.<br /><br />It's books like this that are worth a double and triple read to remind yourself of the details until it becomes a habit (Power of Habits anyone?). You wouldn't become a giver overnight, but the book helps lead you down a path that will better not only yourself but hopefully your company and surroundings.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is great for me. try u will luv it. what did they do make it soooooooo good. why won't u by it. My 10 year old luvs it. stop reading and start buying.

B001DF68MA|5.0|Ah... well made product.  At first, I had a bit of trouble getting the crossbar on my bike due to tight clearance on the stem of my handlebar.  However, I manage to clear it and tighten down.  Once that was done, mounting the seat was effortless.  My daughter enjoys seeing everything in front of me as we ride in our neighborhood.  She can see squirrels, rabbits, dogs, you name it she's got a name for them all.<br /><br />On the other hand, my 3 yr boy can fit but not as comfortable as his knee will hit my handebar if I make turn my handlebar too far either side.  I have to be very careful not to make sharp turns as it can pinch him.

B005MHHREI|5.0|A highly readable and insightful study of China under Mao and how his towering ego dominated every decision he made with regard to China and international events. His  self-interest drove him to excesses that led to the  suffering and repression of illions of Chinese from ordinary peasants to his most loyal and trustworthy colleagues. Mao's absolute ruthlessness, as so clearly described and documented in this biography, made me aware of my own naivete when evaluating the decisions made by those in power.  While this biography has a very clear bias against Mao it is nevertheless an essential read for any student of China and the East and modern history.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good education, maneuvers easy, wonderful story telling, delightful impact on some history. Beautiful imagination, beautiful background details, enjoyable and a very enjoyable game.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I didn't begin watching The Good Wife until mid-way thru the third season. Terrific to be able to see every show on Amazon Prime
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have to say that I loved this book!! I was leery while reading it because there has been so much negativity surrounding the book and the author. I finally reached the end of the book and was relieved that the ending was not bad like I had heard it was. I was happy to see that there will be more books in the Crossfire series. I LOVE the Crossfire series and am looking forward to the books to come!! There was plenty of sexiness and who could get tired of Gideon Cross?? Keep turning them out Sylvia, good job!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|In my opinion Goodfellas is a really good film. Knowing that this film is based on a true story, I felt that made it much more interesting. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracca and Robert Di Nero give exceptional performances. and really bring these characters to life<br />I love Casino as well and while they are totally different films. The characters Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro play have the same quality. The scene in which Joe Pesci's character thinks he is going to be &#34;made&#34; but is not is an exceptional scene. I think his performance of his character, almost bi-polar is exceptional. Alll in all I have to give this 5 stars.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|all 8 harry potters in one case on blu ray! perfect solution to the miss matched cases that were driving me nuts on my shelf and they are all in the most recent format! ( didn't the first one get released on Video and DVD?)

B00140PK6O|5.0|If you are a fan of British historical dramas, then you could enjoy \\"Cranford.\\"  It may be a bit slower for some who might expect it to be something like \\"Downton Abbey,\\" but for those who enter into the backwater self-enclosed (or so it may seem at first) world of Cranford, you might well be charmed by it.<br /><br />Set in a small town in the 1840's England, the story of Cranford is based on the interactions of a finely-knit ensemble of characters--including the marvelous Judi Dench and other actors you will easily recognize if you have watched much British television or even the Harry Potter movies--as they either fight to hold on to the past or to bring in the future.  The stories range from poor squatters who must poach to bring food to the table to the lonely Lady of the Manor who seems cold at first, until you realize she is a woman in pain.  The town gossip with a feather in her cap is absolutely hilarious and you will never forget the incident with the cat and the buttermilk.<br /><br />Many of the main characters are women, including spinsters and widows, and they gossip about any and everything and are shocked (oh my!) by the idea of new muslins from Paris or who might have given new gloves to someone else and consult their book about what a bunch of flowers might mean when received.  Let alone all of the trouble that a single Valentine's Day card can cause.<br /><br />This is the story of a gentle age, when men and women still bowed to each other and people of a certain class all strived to adhere to an understood moral compass.  Yet, the story also addresses the trials of being poor and hungry at that time, of lost loves and opportunities, the misfortunes and grief of death, and how that same compass might be wrong when it comes to who deserved an education or to open a business of their very own.<br /><br />The storyline was based off of several novellas, with some additions, but it retains the witty commentary of the times by the author.  If you openyour heart to Cranford, it won't disappoint.

B0091X2K0A|5.0|Up there with the best of the Vietnam War movies. From the massively percussive opening dialogue to the dark Disney-inspired finale, Kubrick continually surprises in this absorbing masterpiece. Watch his other films, the man was a genius.
B000F8O35U|1.0|Discs were not properly secured/attached to pole causing several scratches when received...blurry pictures... Disney label on the discs misspelled as DISNDY...definitely not an original disc sold by Great Deals & Buy rather an imitation/copied....<br /><br />Disney handles/examines their products perfectly before its released...its disappointing spending a fortune to purchase from a Vendor such as Great Deals & Buys...
0061950726|5.0|The story will take you back in time but also balances with a present<br />day story, which is seamless.  They work together!<br /><br />I loved it, I won't go into plots and all, that is available in the description.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to pick this book up each afternoon!!!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|After reading this book it is not that hard to see why I was brought to it after hearing all of the rave reviews.  After reading a lot of vampire books I thought it was very refreshing to finally have a new concept to connect with.<br /><br />Sophia's character was developed wonderfully along with her supporting cast as anybody who reads the book will attest.  We are introduced to Sophia right from the start and then we get carried along in wonderment as we flip the pages.  Hamilton paints pictures with her words in a masterful way.  The story flows in and out of scenes perfectly which makes it easy for the reader to follow along.  Hamilton has a way of building suspense into the scenes so that it helps carry us along into the next.  For being a first time author this book sure surprised me in quality.<br /><br />Hamilton is a very inspiring, creative, and a truly talented writer in this genre, and probably any genre that she wishes to tackle.  I would recommend this book to anyone that loves the Paranormal and Urban Fantasy genres.  Or, if you are looking for a fresh new read in a new genre, this is a great book to pick up!<br /><br />A must read for all!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This was a very good remake of the classic story and this was a good deal.  I bought it here because my local stores were out of stock but Amazon was not!

6303921248|1.0|I hate it because the tapes are horribly defective.  They waiver and squeal when they play.  All 6 are defective.  Goodwill only charge $1.35 for the box set, but charged $3.99 to ship!  Crap was sent!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I just started playing yesterday, and I'm hooked. Im having a hard time turning it off. Some battles are a little hard, but what's the point of playing if every thing is going to be easy.

B0000C9V3T|5.0|A showcase of Tarantino's knack for picking great music for his movies.  Best soundtrack since American Graffiti.  You can't go wrong with this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Okay, so I know a lot of people have been reading mixed reviews about this book. As I'm sure that is with any book that has hype, some will love it and some will hate it. But okay let me tell you why I loved it. First, I went in knowing there is going to be 2 more books. So I expected that not all loose ends would be tied up. Second, ladies... It's Gideon, need I say more? Third, the sex. Okay! Dominant Gideon is back..and we all know how I love my dominant men.  Fourth, IT'S GIDEON! I don't care if I said that already, that is a good enough reason in itself. FANGIRL TIME!! FANGIRL FANGIRL FANGIRL!!<br /><br />Okay so the book starts off exactly where the last one left off again. Sigh... What are going to do with Gideon and Eva. I am so trying not to fangirl too much. I am trying really hard, but I don't think ya'll understand my love of GC. Okay. So we have our normal drama, Crazy Mom. And this time I think she pushed Eva a little too far. Heck, she wouldn't pushed me too far as well. There is more drama when it comes to boundaries and privacy, and how mom just does NOT respect them when it comes to Eva. I don't think this woman will EVER learn. I mean like EVER. IT's so annoying. I literally wanted to jump in the book and drag her to her therapist.<br /><br />Of course, we are still dealing with the fallout of Nathan's death. Which actually isn't as cut and dry as I expected.. which is awesome! And of course Corinne. You will NOT believe the drama that surrounds this woman. DRAMA QUEEN! I think she feeds off it. I think she creates it! And that's not all.. BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE...<br /><br />so much more drama. And of course, NO SPOILERS.. so I can't tell you! You won't believe the way everything unfolds. I was like GAAAAH!! Don't make me stop reading! Please!!! I was so happy with the way Eva was in this book. She is so much more mature. The way she acts, the way she handles everything. I am not going to say that she's a complete adult, but she's much more mature than she was before. And believe me when I tell you, she has a lot to handle. Especially a beautiful vacation. And I am going to leave you with that. I give this book 5 toe curling, sheet ripping, speaker blowing hearts.e than she was before. And believe me when I tell you, she has a lot to handle. Especially a beautiful vacation. And I am going to leave you with that. I give this book 5 toe curling, sheet ripping, speaker blowing hearts.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I bought this book for a vacation read.  It was not only a great romance but had good drama too that made it exciting.  I loved the twist in it that I did not expect or see coming.  It's kind of a quick read.  Took about 9 hours total.  I would highly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie.  The book gives more detail than the movie about the characters so it makes it more interesting to see the movie.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Love this show can not wait for season 3 to start!! For me two was even better than season one!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pintrest! I get some of the BEST recipes and crafting/scrapbooking ideas from Pintrest! This app is worth having even if you have other intrests than mine, there's plenty of information and hobbies for everyone.

B00992CF6W|5.0|you get to make tons of stuff! there lots of good updates I like the creepers because when you go up close to them they explode I also like that you can dig down in the ground and find bedrock and when you are in creative mode you can mine through it and fall to the end of the earth.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|An incredible movie that makes you think about the interconnectedness between us all. At first seemingly incongruous all the stories merge. Having watched this movie quite a few times, I keep finding more connections between the characters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Keeps you on your toes and beautifully descriptive. I would definitely recommend this book to others. Glad I took a chance on buying it.
B00370J7E0|4.0|Love, love, love Fleetwood Mac. Saw them twice in concert recently. Tusk was my favorite song they did. However, Rumours is my favorite album.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Ha-Ha! Very funny! MIB 3 is the funniest show I have seen in quite some time. My kids of different ages laughed too. Will Smith's lines are so funny and superbly delivered and I am left wondering whether one of the secrets of the universe is that Josh Brolin really is Tommy Lee Jones' younger clone.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|Good movie. It is only about the portion of his life when he made the movie Psycho. Was fairly light-hearted.
B008Q08EV8|2.0|I started to watch it and it wasn't what I expected it to be. I did not care for it
B00CISC2DA|5.0|As a 15 year BoC follower, I wanted to believe in all the rumors of a new album, but after numerous YEARS of silence it almost seemed like any hope left of new tunes might be fading. Maybe they really are done. Or if not, maybe I should try and stop caring so much because all the rumors that get debunked seem to crush my spirit in strange, sad ways. So that was it- I wasn't going to care so much about a new album. Wait, what, someone found a record in NYC on Record Store Day from Boards of Canada? And what, there's some kind of number code/clue on it and there's more spread across the world? What? Well, not caring went out the window and turned into a sort of mad obsession. No shame here, it felt good to finally get giddy like a kid at Christmas during the brilliant week long, multi-media code reveal campaign leading up to this release. And then the Tokyo midnight digital billboard audio and video teaser- the sound of BoC synths creeping out over the city. And then watching the beginning of the listening party out at the rundown waterpark in the middle of the desert. Anyway, yeah, after all that, it's safe to that never has an album release moved me this way, or gotten me more excited. As if 7 years of waiting for a new release didn't create enough buzz, now we have all this brilliant madness leading up to it. Oh boy.<br /><br />So, OK then- after all that- is it any good? With expectations pushed to an all-time high, will it meet them? Was it worth the wait?<br /><br />Well I guess you'll have to decide. For me the answer is yes.<br /><br />While I have never written a BoC review, because finding the right words was exhausting, and always felt incomplete when trying, I couldn't help but share my thoughts on Tomorrow's Harvest- though it can be tough to fully describe the love, insane attention to detail, the musical and instrumentation techniques used to create the duo's signature sounds, the immense feelings the music stirs up, the subtleties and hidden gems wovendeep within songs (reversed melodies and samples that reveal themselves after being played over and over or backwards), the mystique created by limited interaction with the public (and the idea of a bunker-style life tucked away in the countryside somewhere) and the cryptic symbols and numbers, etc, etc.<br /><br />So with all that mind- this album is interesting in multiple ways. The sound is a mix of classic BoC and some new elements/directions- most notably the arpeggiated synths used throughout (and more of a focus on chords/pads). The album also has a very cinematic feel- which ties in with the album title/art and the concept portrayed of a desolate, destroyed and abandon land (reaping what we sow perhaps, or as Mike put it in a recent interview: \\"It's not post-apocalyptic so much as it is about an inevitable stage that lies in front of us.\\"). There's a lot of open space and dissonance throughout, adding to this feel (Mike said one of the influences of the album was \\"grim 70s and 80s movie soundtracks\\"). So yeah- the album is darker (see Cold Earth- probably one of the bigger crowd pleasers), yet there are certainly some rays of sunshine throughout- refer to the great Nothing is Real (perhaps a sibling of Roygbiv), Palace Posy (that ending!) and New Seeds (may catch a few off guard). That said, if you are looking for a comparison, the album falls closer to Geogaddi and a little MHTRTC than anything else in their official catalog (with nods to the past old tunes as well). However, this album is very distinctly all its own (I'll point to New Seeds again and the gorgeously broken Jacquard Causeway as just a few examples). Production wise it's top-notch. Hi-fi here. The beats are heavy and strong, almost angry at times. The kicks are big and the snares are tight. There's an intense air hanging over this one to say the least. And though it's very easy to say some of the tracks should go on longer, it only adds to the definitive moments created here (per the recentinterview, they said this was done on purpose and was based around the idea of how soundtracks/scores are the same way- music seems to be plucked from a longer body of work and you never get to hear the full piece). Melodies say what they have to say and then they're gone. It's definitely a \\"play it again\\" album, for me anyway.<br /><br />Although I can see where this album could draw criticism (not everyone will like it), it calls for multiple plays, which has been no different than any of their catalog (I've heard a lot people say they were down on Geogaddi and Campfire Headphase at first and have since praised them as their favorite at one time or another). For those baptized BoC, this demands attention and will continue to reveal itself after many, many listens (a grower, as we would expect). And for the easter egg hunters- the recent interview has a quote from Mike saying that the album has more use of subliminals than any other previous album...<br /><br />Yep, they're back.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Great Reading, one of my favorite authors enjoy reading his books fun to re read as you learn something new every time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this app but I can't understand why it is so much harder than the iPad version. I get perfect rounds every time on the iPad, but never on the Kindle Fire! The width of the perfect line is infinitesimal.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|mind numbing but fun time waster. easy to play, challenging and fun but still not a lot of bells and whistles.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It slowly built suspense and had a neat twist for the ending. The only thing I did not enjoy was the profane language used by the characters that added nothing to the story. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys suspense novels.
034580404X|5.0|GREAT BOOK enjoyed it and had for a girls night out for a prize give away. Recommend the product to purchase.

B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|It started out with one wanting to to follow the 2 day fasting and worked for the first 2 weeks...then it stopped being effective so it got old fast....but if you have the endurance I can see it being a lifestyle that can be serious way of weight control...
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Although I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first two it is still a great read. The first two books in the series not only had the emotional roller coaster ride between Gideon and Eva but they also had a definite plot behind it. I feel this book lacked that plot, but considering there will be another in the series it has opened up future plots for the next book which should be an intense read. Still loving the journey of discovery for Gideon and Eva.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|This was classic Star Trek.  The actors were great, as always, and the story line was interesting.  Amusing looking at the controls.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|One of the best series out there. I would highly recommend this series to anyone looking for hours of enjoyment.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|How disapointing! After being told the book would be out December 31 then pushed back to March and of course again pushed back to June and we end up with this disappointment of a book. Now we are expected to buy two more books to complete the story line....this is unexceptable and very unprofessional. The story line in the first two books was great but this one was was really reaching. You will have to go a long way to get me to buy your books again

B005LAIIKI|5.0|This wasn't as over the top as some of his movies so in that respect it was a little bit of a let down but it was still an awesome movie.
0307352153|5.0|Everyone with a young child should read this book.  It will help parents to help their child understand themselves to learn how to pace themselves and keep from being overwhelmed by the expectations of others.  They will be able to recognize that they are okay and to allow themselves to take the downtime they need without feeling they are inadequate.  Kids who are introverts are done a grave disservice when expected to be extroverted, which in turn erodes  their self-esteem and makes them feel inadequate.
B002G4FQI4|5.0|Whenever George Benson drop a CD, believe this it's always great and after all these years, he continue to hit the mark and this album bring it. The remake of sailing and his verus of Family Reunion, what can I say 5 stars *****+ .

B001ANSSDC|3.0|did not know what the book was about when I purchased it.  Just knew that the move had done well.<br />book made me crazy.  if you want to just be entertained this is not the book for you.  thought provoking.<br />sad, depressing.  Maybe it was when I read it -  I know and acknowledge that people hurt and suffer - just was not receptive to reading about it at that point and time.  Wanted to see the movie after reading the book I will wait and watch it for when it is available for free.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you like sci-fi, ghosts, fantasy, great writing, great stories, great acting, then settle back and get ready for a ride.  It's more fun to watch this series episode by episode, no commercials, no waiting until next week.  The story line is easier to follow.  I love the writing, the science and acting most of all.  I am in awe of writers who know enough and are smart enough to creat this amazing series.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|The characters, story lines, and musical numbers are all great! I thought the show was well cast and they worked nicely with each other.

030789701X|1.0|So they make yet ANOTHER GUIDE for the same game.<br /><br />but wait, yaay, they added content for the DLC!<br /><br />So what happens is, they release a 50% done game, charge you for it. then add the rest of the 50% in parts, as DLCs, so you keep paying them money.<br /><br />They also release the 1st game guide, without DLC content, so you bought a guide which covers only 50% of the game.<br /><br />So when they are done, they release a 100% of the game, which is the Legendary Edition, but with a different game cover, so you give them more money for the same content.<br /><br />And then they release THIS GUIDE. so you finally buy the real game guide which is the 100% one.<br /><br />Hundreds of dollars poorer, you get the equivalent content for one game and one guide.<br /><br />This is marketing at its best.
B002KQOCJ2|5.0|(Second paragraph will be reviewing the physical vinyl)<br />I am a huge AiC fan, I grew up with the band featuring Layne Staley, I will always love that version of the band, a lot of childhood memories! I cannot say enough good things about the new AiC, I give them major props for continuing on in their own way. A lot of people say that the new band cannot stand up to Layne, and I agree to a point, this band is definitely not Layne, although Jerry Cantrell wrote a majority of the music in the early days, or at least collaborated with Layne on almost all of them so you still get the signature AiC sound and lyrics going on. I don't think it's fair to compare this new stuff to Layne, he is gone and has been for quite awhile now, the band has moved on and they have done a fantastic job! A lot of these songs hit radio, so I love that AiC is still getting exposure, pulling in new fans that may not have grown up in the grunge era and in turn people will be checking out, the classics like \\"Dirt\\" and \\"Facelift\\" giving those gems the credit they deserve and carrying on those albums for years to come. I am not going to review every song as several people have already done that, plus everyone has their own taste, so listen for yourself, download it before or listen on youtube to check it out but if you like it, buy it, support this band so they can continue making music!<br /><br />I bought the vinyl version of this album and I must say I feel like I stole it! The packaging is just amazing! It is a gatefold dual LP, matted cover, and I actually didn't know when I purchased it but both LPs are pressed on clear vinyl. I was so stoked when I saw that, I'm so happy to have this in the collection. Everything about the set is just great, feels well made, and like some thought went into this, this is my 3rd purchase of an AiC record and none of them have let me down. When a band puts effort into their products you truly know they care about their music AND their fans. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the set came with the cd version of the album and some inserts with lyrics. Not only did I get the vinyl, but I got CD and mp3 from amazon. What a great value! I actually bought this album when it for sale at $15 (fifteen dollars) but even at the current price of twenty one it is well worth it! I don't really like reviewing the sound of vinyl because I don't have audiophile ears, I purchase vinyl for the nostalgia and the engaging music experience, but sound usually doesn't bug me at all, I do feel like the sound on this album is great, I didn't hear any surface noise and the music sounds heavy, just a truly beautiful album that I would purchase over and over again!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|well written book. it keeps one in reasonable suspense except the ending which I did not like. preferably i would end the story with the 'happy' vacation and not take it one step further
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Enjoyed the suspense.<br /><br />I now realize that I cannot submit a review without all of the other requirements.<br />Therefore, the next time I rent a movie, I will not submit a review.<br />Very bad form.<br />Your customers will suffer because you have chosen to make something so simple, so time consuming.
B003PBB4ME|1.0|Fortunately, my camera is not very heavy. The two feet are too close together. I had to cut the center from each foot, so I could mount it on the tripod. My camera has a mic input, but no mount for one, so I use this as a mic mic mainly. I would never trust this to any camera heavier than a vivitar!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A very fun game! You should totally get this but it is kind of hard a Times... also if you are a horse lover this is a great game for you!
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|action packed but needed a little more dialog,  Otherwise, the dramatics were awesome.  Bruce never gets too old for this kind of film.
0425263924|4.0|Love the trilogy, BUT again Sylvia left too many loose ends.  I would always buy another book and I feel cheated when she leaves us hanging!  She has done this also in her other trilogies so I will have to think twice before I invest in more of her books.  She's a good author, but I hate the TEASES!!
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|This was a great movie, not advertised as much, but I enjoyed it.  Loved the way it brought the audience back to the bootleg days of gangsters.,
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game gives me something to do when I get home and have time to relax. Also, having great graphics and low lag. I recommend this game to any horse lover.
159562015X|3.0|StrengthsFinder 2.0 is not so much a book as it is an online personality profile. The major premise of this book is that people can take one of two avenues for success (in business, love, life, etc.), they can either focus their efforts on minimizing their weaknesses or focus their efforts on maximizing their natural strengths. StrengthsFinder 2.0 (as one might assume from the title), advocates the latter approach and is intended to assist the reader in identifying and maximizing his strengths.<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts. The first part is a presentation of the above mentioned thesis. In books if this genre, one would expect a dizzying amount of anecdotal evidence; but while a couple examples are given, Rath refreshingly bucks the trend and gives the reader \\"the meat.\\" The second part of the book is a brief description of various \\"strengths\\" (what you naturally do better than most of the population, alphabetically arranged) and tips for utilizing these strengths in the workplace.<br /><br />I'll admit that this is the only book I've reviewed that I haven't read cover to cover. Instead, I read the introductory section and the brief descriptions of my particular \\"strengths\\" (as determined by the on-line test). Since (for example), I don't have the \\"woo\\" strength, I don't feel competent evaluating it. However, I found that the strengths I did score well in accurately identified where I tend to excel and described my approach to things well. I feel that I've grown by understanding myself better and the strength-oriented advice has thus far been fruitful.<br /><br />The opening section on the premise was short and to the point. They forcefully argue for the reader to identify and focus on his strengths yet are careful to recognize that there may exist some weaknesses that necessitate minimizing. Their arguments are logical and compelling; I enjoyed reading it and buy into their thoughts.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, StrenghsFinder 2.0 is not so much as book as it is an online test cleverly marketed as a book. Aside from the first section (framing the premise), the rest of the book is pretty useless. After using the sealed code inside the book to access the online test, you receive a printer-friendly recapitulation of the \\"strengths\\" in section 2 that pertain to you. You may only take the test once and must purchase another book to gain another access code should you want a co-worker, spouse, or other person to take it. Like other reviewers, I had difficulty actually getting to the online test. I imagine this is party due to my lack of computer skills, and partly due to the awkward layout of their advertised web page. The test takes about 30 minutes, questions are timed (so that you don't think about it too much and answer the way in which your mind naturally works).<br /><br />In all, StrengthsFinder 2.0 is an excellent premise, a fine analysis of common strengths, and sound advice for persons exhibiting said strengths. But is it really a book? If book is defined as a series of sheets of paper with words/pictures on each page...yes, I suppose it is. If book is defined as a logically presented, complete thesis...then it's not really a book...it's more along the lines of a thick instruction manual, telling you how to take an on-line test. And while the premise, analysis, and advice is good, I argue that it's still incomplete. I find myself wanting to know more about my particular strengths--theory as well as practice, anecdotal as well as statistical. It is my hope that a follow up book (without an on-line component) is forthcoming.<br /><br />In all, I would recommend this \\"book\\" and believe it will be a great aid in leading to vocational excellence and fulfillment.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The best in the market! The extensive language packages are incredible and for someone who speaks more than two languages this is a major plus!
B00594XOZU|4.0|I think this app is very great and amazing the only thing it needs is for kindle fire to have videos to send and receive other than that great
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A fabulous read which weaves it's way through historical events infrequently touched upon in contemporary fiction.  The main character much like Forrest Gump manages to land in and clearly escape his misadventures to become the 100 yr old man who climbed out the window to start a new adventure.  The supporting characters all individually present as wall flowers or misfits together they are quite something else.  Quite simply an enjoyable and side splitting read.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book didn't seize to amaze me in every way possible, from mystery, to romance, to angst this book has it all. I fell in love with Margo Roth as I do with all of greens characters. I applaud you john, good work.
B0082Z447U|4.0|This is the second book I've read by Wilkie Collins. I was not disappointed. The suspense and trials amidst the romance troubles made this read very enjoyable and kept me on the edge of my seat wanting more.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I believe this item works well but I could not find a way to combine multiple images to make one now It maybe my own ignorance or maybe it's not in there at all but other than that no complaints
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is very good as it includes different places which makes it more interesting and significant to other games.<br />It is very enjoyable and fun but I would like it if we could finish the places then change it so flit will be Better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it now even more because the new 0.7.1 came out with buckets and cake now with spawner eggs pretty cool:)
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|OK I will start of by saying it may CHARGE you again after buying the application but when it's done, you have a awesome game, so worth it and if you DON'T believe me THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book made me cry. How can someone be so heartless, so cruel? There's hope for whatever and her girls. May God bless them .
1572816112|5.0|Very beautiful design, dark imagery but I think it creates a nice neutral position on what the cards present; the tarot deck didn't have any cards missing so that was a relief! Can't wait to do reading with it!
B00AFEXRME|1.0|I'm a veteran pilot and couldn't finish watching this trashy film. No pilot like this would ever be allowed within 50 feet of the cockpit of any airliner. His pilot's license should be shredded and burned. Aware of his addictions - drinking alcohol inflight, while talking to passengers on the intercom, for one - the entire flight crew should be fired and charged with felonies (as knowing accomplices) for allowing this miscreant to operate an airliner full of passengers. I stopped watching during this scene - couldn't stomach any more.
1572816295|5.0|Love the artwork, great quality and printing, they look professional. Didn't have any cards missing so that is a big plus!
B003TH14H4|5.0|Perfect character development. The chemistry is beyond anything else that has been done. The writers keep it fresh but Stana and Nathan make it work. You must watch the series from the beginning.
0738711500|5.0|Love this deck, pretty imagery and the book is useful, great introduction to tarot readings. The quality of the cards is nice and good weight and printing is done really well, looking forwards to doing readings :)
B006GH6IWU|5.0|The Queen video is a must have if your a fan, with alot of detail going back to the early years.<br />I highly recomend it.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I am a 11 and many of my friends said it was boring and hard to get through:) I completely disagree it was so enjoyable to watch the girls grow up! The beginning Is a bit hard to get through but once you get used to the writing it's absolutely worth it!!!!! GET THIS BOOK!!! it is amazing!!
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|Some great actors and some funny moments, but it could have been better. There's also a weird \\"romance\\" between the babysitter and the dad and the 13 year old son that felt unnecessary...
B0097HSS4M|1.0|This was seriously a waste of time and money. I thought maybe it was better than my other one because it was rated 5 stars by everyone, but it's really not my other app is waaaayyyy better! -____-
B00CWY76CC|5.0|nice brain workout. not too difficult but it is clever enough to hold you interest. you also cant beatvthe price.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|You will love this game I am so glad I bought this game it is fun.I don't get addicted to games
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its a fun game to play. I love how you can design how your ponyville looks like. And now<br /> that they have Canterlot its even more fun. The only thing I don't like is how Princess Salesta lives in ponyville not Canterlot.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|It is a pretty forgettable and simple story.  It's worth watching for the FX and music, but not much else.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I really like it. I love the dresses and want them for me too.  I like putting blush on them. Cool app!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|We enjoyed the movie, but it was difficult to dismiss some jumps in the story line.  The movie reminded often that it was just a movie; it didn't draw me in.  I did appreciate the &#34;old school&#34; elements, which I won't mention here in order to avoid spoilers.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy to flip but fun hopefully they come out with new tracks and vehicles so I can have some new content
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|..Kept me awake far too long into the night...wish it was longer puzzles could be more difficult. Loved the 3d
0553386816|5.0|I received this book as a gift, and I'm glad I did.  The art of the short story is captured in these stories.  There is not much market for short stories (I believe),but these stories capture the essence of Mississippi and deserve to be read.  The characters are unforgetable \\"characters\\".  I heard my wife laugh out load when she was reading the book (she's a true southern belle). Wish there were more books like this one.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|It was an okay movie with some nice moments but there were a few scenes that didn't need to be in the movie that were unnecessary for a PG-13 rating that ruined it for a family night.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfed is a fun game that everyone in my family enjoys playing.  It has challenge that change daily as well as monthly.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I can't join my sister's game and she can't join her friends game and I did not get the update. Ps. Can you fix it I would likely 0&middot;6&middot;2
B00969PR18|5.0|no reason to be rude. I think even a stupid store like valaro is cool jewls. oh what I saying I wouldnt go to a complaint
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is so fun!!! sometimes I hit a block where I ran out of energy but it all comes back! also it takes a while to regenerate the various types of payment without actually paying. I love this game though!
B000002LFZ|5.0|I have had this album for many many years I lost it in hurricane Sandy. The album is great ,It has Great songs Fleetwood Mac is great .I highly Recomend
B00338QENI|5.0|I'm in the medical field, so what I found most interesting about this book, was the way in which things were done regarding medical care during that time frame, and what we can take from it today....
B005HF0GMA|5.0|The little girls are all adorable. I love how the whole family is worked into the plots.I wish it were still on TV so we could see more of what happens to the girls when they become teenagers.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It described the conditions of the people during the time of slavery, both the slaves and the owners. It was a page turner.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I am an avid reader and i got a Kindle for Christmas a few years ago. It's great to know that my favorite classics are free on Kindle
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This book helped me in working through my own experience, as well as healing from a major stroke. The book also helped me realize that I had much to give others in helping them through illness and dying counciling.
B004G0DN7W|5.0|Someone is going to make millions on the remake of this movie with today's technology, additional plot, and CGI.  Who will take Yul Brynner's place though?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Nicely written by one of the best fiction writers today. I suggest you read this while on vacation. This is an enjoyable book.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book but there were parts that bored me so I skipped over them.  Enjoyed the pictures.  I read this online through the icloud reader so I could get a better look at the photos.  Still hard to see, but much better then viewing them on the kindle.
030746363X|4.0|Well, I’ve started following the slow-carb diet. I am hoping to lose 20lbs in 30 days. So guess we will see how that pans out. I really like the food thus far. Also will do the butt exercises. So hopefully in a month. Just in time for my birthday. I will have a new body…<br />Book came nice and fast. Very good condition.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|this was a great movie!! I will order it a gain. or go buy it, it made me cry but still enjoyed it.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I really like Bernard Cornwell's sagas of English history, from his Arthurian trilogy through the Anglo-Saxon saga to the wars between France and England.  This book is no exception.  It is well written, with a fast paced and believable plot and characters that are carried over from other Cornwell books so they are well developed.  A great read for anyone interested in the time when English identity was forming and the Saxons had to fight with the Danes for England.  Just the right mix of battle, fighting, and intrigue.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|A good read but SO sad! Seems very true to the times it was set in. Would recommend to friends.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Best book ever!! A must read. It will completely have you hooked and begging for more! Trust me and read it!
1250027624|5.0|This is a beautiful book. Well photographed. Bought one for my daughter who is also a fan. Takes place in our homeland!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Nicely wraps up the series, no spoilers.  I always enjoy Sookie Stackhouse books and this one did not disappoint me.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I'm really disappointed in this book. Compared to the first two it had nothing going on, and the way it ended was horrible. Really felt like she did that just so we would have to buy another book. I've loved this series up until now and it really is in no way a 4 book series.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Amazon Instant TV rocks on Xbox 360.  This is a terrific fairy tale series with all the action, suspense and love mushiness included.  Has everything.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Vikings is a very solid show. I assume it's fairly historically accurate, one of those shows like Rome where the major events, some character events and the way of life are all accurate, but they'd have no idea about the general dialogue. I root for the brits though, hard not to.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love being able to purchase amazon series and watch it instantly on my Xbox 360.  Terrific TV series!  Can't wait for next season.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Fast Shipping.  Good iPhone Case. My daughter love it.  One thing is that the screw easily misplaced, my daughter lost is within a week.
087033039X|5.0|if you wanting projects with step by step instructions this is not the book for you.  if you want to learn to braid; leather, rope, paracord, etc. this is the perfect reference book.  i liked it so well that i later purchased the Encyclopedia of Leather Braiding also by Bruce Grant.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I tried this book to see if it was as entertaining as the Harry Potter series and was totally surprised that it is a fascinating book. Then to find out there is a series WOW !!  I like the way Morgan Rice keeps you guessing and trying to figure out what will happen next to the characters.
098555780X|5.0|this book is an excellent reference.  very basic instructions at the beginning that prevent repitition later in the various projects.  clear and specific instructions with photographs take the braider from beginning to end on some very complex looking braclets and braids.  execellent way to spend a cold rainy weekend day with nothing else to do.
0143038583|5.0|I thought I knew a fair amount about nutrition but did not realize just how industrial our food industry has become.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this story and can't wait till the next one. God if I have to wait till next year I may just die. I so hope this has a very good ending.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Once a watched an episode or two of Season 1, I was hooked!<br />I don't often find a TV show that grabs my attention like this.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|it slowed my tab and forced restarts I would not like to recommend any one using tab 2 p3000 please
B000LXHK2C|4.0|This is a perfect movie on a rainy day when you feel like &#34;getting away&#34;. Predictable and entertaining, you will watch this over and over.
B00622B3MY|3.0|Sweet story about famous car learning to accept and not be ashamed of a less sophisticated friend. This friend turns out to have real value and saves the day.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I didn't agree with some of points that Sheryl made but for the most part, it brought to light a lot of things I had neglected to take into account in my own career or simply ignored. Sheryl is an inspiration to women everywhere and I hope to take a lot of what she wrote about and apply it to my own professional and personal life.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|Always delightful. Jack watches it with breakfast. He is 1 1/2 years old.  Very upbeat people helping each other is its own reward.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Overall a very entertaining movie. Definately worth watching. I have 12 more words left... now 5. Good movie though.<br />Gosh.
B005XBKXV2|4.0|I would recommend this for the delightful music and animation.  It appeals to the kids for the talking animals and action.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I stopped wearing a wristwatch a long time ago. I just rely on my cell phone which is always with me and accurate. When I needed to take a test and was not allowed to bring a phone with me, I dug through my junk drawer for a watch and all of them had dead batteries. After buying batteries to bring them all back to life (about 5 different types, too), and after spending way too much money for them, followed by the high PITA factor of removing all of the backs, I decided to find a self-winding watch. Hence, this one (and one in a different color). A VERY nice looking watch and it functions well. Smooth, quiet movement and fashionable enough for me. The price is right and NO MORE BATTERIES!
B00BBQXQFI|3.0|Good but not my favorite.  Story evolves around Jack realizing his potential and through this discovering why he was chosen.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I stopped wearing a wristwatch a long time ago. I just rely on my cell phone which is always with me and accurate.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|Totally love the movie! Excellent/Perfect quality. I highly recommend this product to anyone and its for a great price too.
B00354YA2M|5.0|I live in NZ, and visited Australia in just one occasion. I wish I have read this book before then.<br /><br />Bryson makes you love the country, show you its quirks and problems, and keeps you very entertained along the way. Awesome stuff. :)
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Something's Gotta Give is one of my all time favorite movies. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are marvelous, as is the entire supporting cast. Highly recommended......
B000SEFIT6|5.0|I learned everything I needed to know about Agile with this book - it was even when of my main academic references on the subject.<br /><br />Mike is an expert on the field and after dumping all the theory knowledge on you gives you useful practical examples on how to do things. Really, go for it.
B0040ZPLBY|5.0|Once, I watched an entire season of this stellar show in the span of two days, and removed myself from its spellbinding pleasure ONLY to eat and shower.  The legend of King Arthur is no doubt based upon a real historical person, and this show takes the available literature & lore on the subject and takes the ball and runs with it.  The story lines are fantastically imaginative, the acting is superb and the settings are a visual feast for the senses. I cannot speak highly enough about this wonderful, wonderful series.  Bravo to the creators and to the actors!!! This show - just like the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable - no doubt will stand the test of time.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I am in the process of reading the book now and so downloaded the soundtrack because the clips on the movie trailers were so inviting.  I am not regretting this purchase and can hardly wait to see this particular movie adaptation.  I will probably also watch the older adaptations as well, but only once I finish reading the book!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|held our attenion if only to see where this is headed. I have similar types of story lines, in movies but done more better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thought season one was great, but season two delivers the gripping story line. It's doesn't manner if you watch it all at once or leave time between each episodes. Once involved you stay there wondering what next.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I normally don't like movies like this but this one was different. To me looking at the previews you'd think it was simply a chick flick which in some ways I guess it is. This one just had a different tone that you sort of wish life was like. Basically you wish someone just as crazy as you wants you in the same manner.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|Just another ego trip for cruise.<br />Lee Child's books are great, the character Reacher is a large framed under spoken hero.<br />Looking forward to Child's next book, but no more cruise as Reacher, please...
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This series further expands upon the manipulation, style, and charm of Hannibal Lecter in a way that only Mads Mikkelsen can.  The clever plots of each individual episode draw the viewers into appreciating the deeper complexity of the overall larger interaction between Hannibal, Will Graham, and Jack Crawford in a way that always leaves the audience hungering for more.
0743270754|5.0|I was so impressed with Lincoln's strategic insights and knowledge.  Great book.  What a page turner.  Educational and entertaining read.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Great movie. If you read the book, you will notice obvious differences between the book and the movie. The movie is still great and charming capturing the essence and character of the story. I personally loved it :)
B008M7JODC|5.0|Show kept me in suspense while also adding humor, was very enjoyable to watch. I give it two thumbs up.
0061997811|5.0|Beautiful book great price. I bought it used like new. It come with a Marauders map and yule ball invitation. This book is great for the fan and artist in us all.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is so important! Read it and share it. As a 50 year old woman who has been in the work force and full time raising children so much of what Ms Sandberg says resonates. I look forward to the world she is encouraging us all to create. And I thank her for leaning in in a big way.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett continues holding the reader's attention with a stimulating combination of history and novel.  Am looking forward to Book 3 of the Century Trilogy!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was the first book that I have read by this author. I couldn't put it down. The well written book keeps the reader in suspense...you want to know more about what happened....who did what...when. It makes parents stop and think...what their children are really capable of, due to feelings. I will def be reading more of her books!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|A little hard if you can't read so my grandchild has to get help but otherwise fun without constant tries to use real money plus allot to do besides just feeding and collecting as other games
B0064MGU98|5.0|This series is addictive because the acting is good, the family dynamics are interesting and the character development keeps one guessing.
B002GYI96U|4.0|I enjoyed this book. There were surprises and overall it was a well developed story. Love Sophie Kinsella (aka Madeline Wickham).
B004SEUIWO|5.0|I did not make it to the theater when this came out and I am not much for renting dvd's ... Enjoyed the show!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|not to bad great for killing time lacking a little in ability for defense of base but over all a good game
B0058RCVYS|4.0|The human behavior shown in the story seems believable and the crass differences of the Danish and Indian culture of today was well portrayed without exaggeration.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|This movie was used during my sleepover, and it was a great movie with an awesome cast, great plot and storyline and some funny moment :) I enjoyed this movie and it was a bit like not enough romance I thought between those two :( they are too cute!

0375703861|3.0|Is this book a modern classic?  Sometimes the critics and I don't see eye to eye.  The ending to this book almost justified the 500 pages I had to read to get there, but not quite.  Archie Jones routinely makes life-and-death decisions by flipping a coin.  As bad decisions go, though, his are equaled by those of his long-time friend Samad Iqbal.  Samad longs to send his twin sons to Bangladesh so that they can become good Muslims and escape decadent Western influences.  Alas, he can afford to send only one and makes the ill-advised decision to send the studious son Magid, rather than the wayward son Millat.  Naturally, Magid embraces science there, eschewing religion, while Millat joins a fundamentalist Islam group here in the good old U.S.A.  The linchpin, though, is the Chalfen family, who host Millat and Archie's daughter Irie, along with their own son Joshua, in a school-imposed detention that reshapes everyone's lives.  Marcus Chalpen is a genetic researcher whose FutureMouse will prove to the world that genetic engineering can overcome the apparent randomness of fatal diseases.  I don't want to give too much away, but the finale brings together a volatile amalgamation:  Millat's jihad, Archie's mother-in-law and her band of Jehovah's Witnesses, the scientific community, and Joshua's animal rights group.  We can expect sparks to fly, but the surprise lies elsewhere.  The author treats the fragility of life in an interesting way, I must admit.  It literally turns on a dime, and a life saved can make a huge, unforeseen impact.  That impact may be positive or it may be negative or it may just stir the pot--or the plot, in this case.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  I loved the other books and read them within a day.  This book took me a week to read and the ending was just disappointing.  It is all just a money a grab which is disappointing.  If the book was as good as the other two just maybe I would feel differently, but it misses the mark
B007W0YVRO|5.0|Yiruma's a very talented pianist! I discovered him on Pandora and had to have this CD! So very soothing and relaxing....
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|The movie is very good. It shows how the thing first started. The special effects are very good. It will have you jumping out of your seat
B005BOHYW2|5.0|What a lovely, easy read!  I read the book in one sitting and enjoyed the psycology, real life and ending.
B00C7O8TSM|2.0|Listening to this CD is OK.  I thought it would be more of a celebration than just wrote recordings of their studio recordings.  Again, hoping for a celebration, the booklet does nothing more that give credits to those who participated in the shows.  The fact that all nine members of the band also sing makes me wonder how much singing and harmonies are performed by the actual Beach Boys.  For the hard core fans and those who attended the shows only.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Love this book and this series! I got my daughter reading them and she loves them too! Can't wait for book 11!
B005KELQEU|5.0|I did not want a slipcover that held my kindle with an open/close flap. This sleeve allows you to take out the kindle and hold it to read. The interior is padded so the kindle screen is safe and secure, but small enough to stow and go!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Never really watched SNL, but Tina Fey always seemed to be an interestingly quirky person capable of good deadpan delivery, which I love. This book is a rambling, loosely-structured cavort through Tina Fey's memories, with stealthy laugh-out-loud moments that you don't always see coming. Not &#34;trying-to-be-funny&#34; humor. Just who she is. And candid: hearing that no matter who you are, the dress size that other people want you in is always too small (the photoshoot).<br />Which is what makes this feel like you're just grabbing a coffee with her between sets. And she just happens to be a very real, very warm, very funny person.<br /><br />I read it in choppy snippets, which I think it is best suited for: waiting for the bus, at the DMV, and other aspects of life that could be so much more fun if you just had some good company.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Science fiction readers will enjoy this novel's ability to easily capture the imagination. Asimov's easy style of writing reaches out and grabs your attention. I especially enjoyed his descriptions of future worlds and how they relate to our modern civilization.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I like this game the only thing is the blue orbs have to cost money!!! I know they have to make money but this is a mostly kids game.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I love this game. The game play is extremely fast (Depends on amount of players), Guns are Amazing, I used to play Nova 1-3 But I deleted 1 and 3 for this game. Nova 2 is my second favorite now. If you don't get this game and you're alive with a kindle fire. You might as well sell your kindle fire because without this game your device is a waste.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|Fun but missing some of the features I like in free flow like the ability to reset and start all levels over.  The sound is also kind of annoying but you can turn it off.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We rented this because of the ratings ( 3 stars ) and it was a comedy . But it was a real piece of crap. I could understand those not very bright loving it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is a great way to do puzzles without it even taking room in your kitchen or family.room. and every time you exit the game you can open it back up to where you were exactly at.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you loved 50 shades you'll love this too...gets you hooked and you can't put it down!<br />It's my summer guilt pleasure
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a great game to play and super fun! Totally worth $6.99. On the Apple store, they have a new update in minecraft and I heard its good. I'm still waiting for the update on the kindle. Update faster!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie does not take itself too seriously!  With none of the &#34;obligatory sex scenes&#34; of most movies these days, it is a fun movie for a stay at home date night.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found the clarity with which Eben struggles to put his Spiritual experience into human words is part of the joy of the book.  He is clear that he is not doing the experience any justice, yet that feeling couched in the words connects with me.  There are times that I put the book down and close my eyes to try and understand the experience through feeling it and not reading it.  I appreciate his journey and am grateful that he has shared it with me.  For those who know there is a heaven and a loving and all powerful God this book may add some additional dimensions to your understanding, as it did mine.  For those who do not believe, his education, background and career experiences may ground his words for you in a way that you may believe that the loving caring God could exist.  Moving from does not exist to could exist is a fabulous step in the right direction, I believe.  May God continue to bless your journey.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat from almost the very beginning. Not one for people who are even slightly squeamish, does get fairly bloody at points.
B004EPYZXU|3.0|Since the back of the Blu-ray case wasn't displayed on the Amazon webpage for this movie, you would't know that the digital download copy from iTunes is no longer available after 12/31/2012. Amazon should make the digital copy of Apollo 18 to compensate all us fools who bought this product thinking you would get the digital copy. Alas, it is available from Amazon Instant Video for $14.99. Are you game for a class action?
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This would be a good &#34;made for TV movie&#34;.<br />It is a well laid out with the pieces joining for an interesting read.  It takes place in Ireland and the &#34;folkie-ness&#34;, the friendships, and the conversations are super.<br />The story ties all up into a neat package by the end and leaves the reader satisfied.
B00005MP58|5.0|My wife and grandchildren love it. made a great birthday gift.  Very well done. Not like watching Duck Dynasty but can be tolerated by men.
B0015AARJI|5.0|First off, I bought this controller from Worldwide Sales. They did a very good job and sold me a legit SONY controller. I purchased one earlier from a different retailer, and it was a very convincing fake. The battery was poor, and the controls were a little off. It wasn't bad, but once I looked more, it had a very convincing sticker on the back  which indicates fake.<br /><br />All in all, the controller that I bought from Worldwide Sales is an actual Sony, and it is working very well. Here are some tips to help judge between telling a Sony to a fake:<br /><br />A real Sony feels heavier in your hand and sits better. Also, the PS button is centered and the LED indicators are flush with the controller, and it has a formed tag in the back that is plastic, not a sticker.<br /><br />A FAKE is lighter, the PS button can be off center and the marking on the buttons can rub off after little use. If you have a fake, it will usually have just a sticker on the back that is poorly placed and the LED's are usually raised a bit. Also the battery is usually very poor, being dead within an hour of use. Finally, a fake will have a harder time pairing with the PS3.<br /><br />When you look to purchase an authentic Sony, make sure that you do your research first. Make sure that the company is very good and has plenty of 5 star ratings. Also, check their return policy and make sure that if it is a fake, you can return it with no hassle.<br /><br />If you are in doubt, buy it from a local store such as Best Buy where you shouldn't have a problem.<br /><br />Lastly, just keep in mind that some of the fakes are very good fakes and you might not be able to tell the difference until you really start to play with it.<br /><br />Good Luck!
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|This cd was recommended to me by a friend.  I regret this purchase - should have reviewed songs prior to purchase.
B0058SNKNS|4.0|These were my 3rd pair of these shoes from Crocs. This size 8 was a bit smaller than my last. I'm an 8.5 but the size 9 is too big. I love wearing these shoes to work and around the house.
B006WM2FFS|4.0|But besides the orgeous photography and the landscape this movie had a &#34;message&#34; that made it different from yout typical Kung Fu type movie. How difficult it is to forgive atrocities, but by doing so one avoids becoming no different then the ones one fights against.<br />Every would-be terrorist should watch this movie.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I tried it out and when I was done, I knew it was a really good app. It shows exercises that actually do something, and is like you are back in p.e., but can actually take breaks. If only I could rate it more than five stars!
B00753MBHA|4.0|Like so many times as before a lead singer leaves a popular band and so starts the fan drama, I totally agree with the masses Accept without Udo is not the same but, the core of the band is there still making great in your face metal. If you a fan of metal, give these last 2 cds a try, you will be in for a very pleasant surprise. look how popular Back in Black was (new singer in tow) this is a awesome metal band.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The Reader is a provocative and heartbreaking film which tells the tale of a May-September affair between Hanna (Kate Winslet) and 15 year-old Michael (David Kross) in the decade after WWII. Beyond that, however, I believe the film is an allegory of the relationship between those Germans who were responsible for the Holocaust and those loved ones who came after them, and were forced to confront the horrible truths at a later time. It deals with the guilt, the anger, and the conflicting emotions therein. The story is heartbreaking because it reminds us that we are all struggling with guilt, emotions, and the legacy we have created for ourselves by our actions or inactions. It neither asks the viewer to forgive nor condemn. It merely shows us how similar we are to these people by putting their humanity in our faces.<br /><br />The movie is provocative for both the many nude/sex scenes between Michael and Hanna, and because it purposefully makes it a bit harder to blame or label, not only those responsible for the Holocaust, but all of the people in our history who have a connection between an evil deed and tacit complicity, regardless of the severity.  There is a powerful moment during the trial when a confused Hanna is questioned about her responsibilities as a guard and she innocently asks one of the judges, \\"What would you do?\\" None of the judges has an answer. Throughout all of history's atrocities, there are always those who were simply \\"doing their job.\\" It's so easy to imagine being the heroic person who would stand up a make a difference, but the fact is, few possess that much courage and conviction.<br /><br />Many recoil at the sexual perversity, but I think the intention was to make the audience uncomfortable. Not only did Hanna's seduction help create a person who would end up sharing her emotional void, but so too did the generation responsible for the Nazi atrocities force their shame onto the generation that followed them. The beauty of The Reader for me was in how these characters can speak for generations; the passion, the heartbreak, the guilt, the shame, the anger, and the eventual cold-blooded detachment.<br /><br />The acting is stellar throughout, with special props going to Kate Winslet and David Kross for their fearless portrayals and for breathing such believability into their characters. To engender empathy for people who run the gamut from despicable to emotionally empty is a nod to their acting skill. To compel me to watch the drama of such unsavory individuals is a testament to the power of this movie. The Reader might disturb you, anger you, disgust you, or even confuse you. Certainly one of the principal responsibilities for art is to provoke such reactions.<br /><br />P.S. I don't usually include info about the dvd extras, but since I watched them this afternoon, I thought I'd add a sentence or five. There are about a handful or so, focusing on the set design with a German woman who had left her native country during the post WWII period to get away from the drama, a lengthy bit with Kate Winslet getting into her older make-up, an interview with Kross and the director, and a bit with the music director. There are also quite a few deleted scenes that must've made it pretty far as they seem like a finished product, if you know what I mean. They are illuminating and at least one in particular should've been included as it not only bridges two scenes that have little continuity, but also features a very poignant conversation between Michael and an older truck driver. It's kind of chilling and should have been in the movie.e was in how these characters can speak for generations; the passion, the heartbreak, the guilt, the shame, the anger, and the eventual cold-blooded detachment.<br /><br />The acting is stellar throughout, with special props going to Kate Winslet and David Kross for their fearless portrayals and for breathing such believability into their characters.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|my grandson downloaded this and I'm having a blast!  Love the graphics! I giggle  every time his snaps back! You just have to play this game!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I am so glad I got this. I have played it twice now. I loved the story line. I actually jumped because of a creepy part. The hidden object part was great. I can't enough good things. I can't wait for the next part!
B003NBFZTE|2.0|I did not feel like these helped my legs in any way. I was still sore in my thighs after sleeping in these. For the price, they seem super expensive. They feel just like Under Armour and that brand is a lot cheaper.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book by Mrs. Sandburg, she made valid points with research to back it up. The book was easy to read and brought many new thoughts to the forefront of my mind. Well done. Highly recommend for reading groups as well as women's groups.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|in its' day, a phenomenal experience. Just when digital computers and graphics were in their infancy, Disney redefines the movie goers experience..
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The quality of the bluray it's excelent and it has extra scenes of how movie was made, this is a great edition of the movie.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|did not need to know about the drugs & sex orgies,...however, a typical lifestyle for rock bands in 60-70's ( yes, I did not attend Woodstock, something called a job...)
B008NW1M4K|5.0|I'm reading this book in my native language and I think that's the only way to enjoy this book.  The Author certainly knows how to tickle the funny bone and I have caught myself laughing out loud a few times.  The reader will feel guilty laughing while reading, but it's unavoidable.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|sights & sounds of an actual concert in your living room, sound is exceptional and video is excellent. (trumpets & saxes really added that something extra .
B0031RSA24|5.0|RIchard Dawkins carries out a thorough analysis of the flaws in the arguments for religion.  He also points to research that societies all around the world have very similar ideas about good and evil and these ideas long predate the holy books often cited as the source of religious moral authority.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|It was an OK movie. There was a lot of talk about the language, which was not politically correct for today, but probably exactly correct for that time period.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|There are some good visuals in this film and the actors do a very good job but that's about it. Holy moly, the direction is terrible! The way the film was put together and the lightness of it is so unrewarding. BORING!!!!!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The adaptor worked my the Fire for about two weeks.  Then my Fire wouldn't take a charge again.  Very disappointed in it as it was purchased in November 2011 and is not under warrenty  Too bad for me, huh?
1401938906|4.0|Love this book and Pam has such a great way with humor and words.  She really brings it home that we are divine beings and frees us from the chains of oppressive organized religions.  Have recommended this book to several friends.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love my new phone and Kindle availability...works very well in bringing my books when needed--great deal on this for sure!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Personally I thought the game was made very well dungeons were well made and graphics are awesome the only problem I had was the potion regen time  is really long .
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this is a fun action game but there is little control over iron man and there aren't any warning as to where the droids are fireing they should really add a tutorial on the enemy's
0385347774|5.0|Have read all her novels. Her characters are fascinating. Even the &#34;good guys&#34; are deliciously flawed, just like the rest of us!
B006RXPY3C|5.0|Excellent acting by Helen Mirren. I very much enjoy this movie regularly. I love the shots of the English countryside.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I was going to buy the 3D version today and noticed it did not have any special features and was the most expensive of the variety.  So I would have to buy an additional version to get bonus features or Blu-ray combo.  You know what? - out of principle I will not buy any version of the movie.  The movie was extremely flawed, but would have bought anyway because 3D was amazing and had a camp value that so many bad movies that people love have.
B00CISC2DA|2.0|So, a little disclaimer here first: I'm no professional at writing and I'm an amateur when it comes to critiquing. But this time I felt compelled to write something about the latest release from the eco-friendly brothers of IDM, something said from the trenches of one of those who pay for their music and aren't influenced by advertising dollars, or blinded by idol worship. I mean, the way some fans have been anticipating this album, you'd think BoC were God Himself, resurrected and ready to rescue the world from itself on release date. Such was the fervor for any new, official material from the brothers that after they uploaded their new single onto YouTube, their website crashed the same day due to traffic overload.<br /><br />I've listened to the whole album several times since Sunday and I gotta say, for keeping a rather cool head since the announcement for this album's release, I'm not moved much by it. If Mike and Marc were aiming here to make a dystopian horror soundtrack, then mission complete. You can practically do the zombie shuffle through it all (and even creepy zombie moans would sound appropriate in \\"Uritual\\"), as if hearing their Day of the Dead take on the aptly titled \\"White Cyclosa\\" wasn't evidence enough by then. It's almost like the brothers are pulling a BoC on their *own* past; everything that was once alive is now made ghostly, distant, and nostalgic.<br /><br />A third of the tracks are closer to being music (\\"Reach For The Dead\\"), some are mere curiosities (\\"Palace Posy\\"), and a few are tiresome (\\"Jacquard Causeway,\\" \\"New Seeds\\"). A real disappointment is that the breather tracks simply aren't great leaders (\\"Collapse,\\" \\"Transmisiones Ferox\\"), which is shocking when one considers that some fans were looking forward to those the most exactly because they typically lead into their best songs, e.g. \\"Ready Lets Go\\" leading into \\"Music is Math,\\" \\"Bocuma\\"'s lead-in to \\"Roygbiv,\\" \\"A Moment of Clarity\\" to \\"84 Pontiac Dream,\\" the opener for \\"Everything You Do Is a Balloon\\", etc. Without a doubt, the biggest lost opportunity of the album is \\"Split Your Infinities,\\" which opens with such a gorgeous 90 seconds that is so organic and other-worldly you feel buoyant, and then it fizzles out. This could've been the best track of the album, yet the melody fades out nearly as soon as it begins, repetitiously drumming onward for the final three minutes while some garbled & distorted voice makes some noises. What a waste!<br /><br />The one thing I've always enjoyed about BoC is that their music can sometimes catch on a moment of beauty and sustain it; a respite from the trouble of everyday life and of the world at large. \\"Cold Earth\\" and especially \\"Sick Times\\" are two good examples here of that signature sound of theirs that is simultaneously melancholic and yet uplifting. The finest example of this is on \\"Nothing Is Real,\\" a wonderful piece of chin-up after all the depressive atmospheres one must slog through to get to it. It is such a bright contrast to the surrounding darkness that it helps expose the weaknesses of the entire record; definitely the most enjoyable melody in the entire set (among whatever melody can be found to begin with).<br /><br />At the risk of sounding politically correct, I really do hope that Michael and Marcus find something positive and hopeful for their futures, and that they realize that not everything is as dead as this album impresses so hard. What does it say that fans expect more along the lines of Music Has The Right To Children and not of The Campfire Headphase? Rigid to change? Immune to hope? \\"I'd rather sadly roam the earth, long-face pointed downward, shuffling towards the inevitable end of our precious ecosystem\\"? [Shrugs] Who knows. Take my opinion for what it's worth, or don't. But I *do* know one thing: this deathly album's sound is BoC's eco-dirge, their requiem mass for the earth (contrast this to their previous LP, the most cheerful and enjoyable album of their career that\\"true\\" fans loathe so much). Having said that, I won't be extending my arm out to reach for the dead... I'd sooner keep it in the Campfire.<br /><br />UPDATE - April 27th, 2014: Having spent as much time laboring over this album as I've had, I'm adding this: I've only kept an EP's worth of tracks and that's being generous. The somber sonics of \\"Cold Earth\\" has Geogaddi written all over it, \\"Sick Times\\" is the ethereal place you'll end up in after passing under the Coke sign, and \\"Reach For The Dead\\" sums up the whole intended eco-collapse theme of the record, which fares fine on its own, sure... but \\"Nothing Is Real\\" (a funny title in hindsight, considering it's the most *tangible* song of the record) never ceases to make me ache and conclude that pursuing said theme for an entire LP's length was bad judgment on their part. And that's all for me, folks.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Very nice collection. I am more then happy with it. I grew up with the original Star Trek and it is nice to have this collection.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Nice full set of the Series. I am glad they put it all together in one set. It is a very good value.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My 9 year old says it's like Temple Run, but backwards. Instead of getting chased, you're chasing them. You collect the dots as you fly along and try to avoid obstacles. Seems like this is what modern gameplay on a touchscreen is evolving into. You may feel like you've done this before in another game. You have. You also shoot at some things by touching the screen on your target.  I don't think touchscreens make very good game machines. Be nice to have some other sort of interface.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|We were not rivited enough to ever choose this one again to see if there was something we missed, but it made for a good evening movie with popcorn.  Audio/video was just fair in places - we even checked it's release date to see if it was a older movie.  We would recommend it to friends to watch on Amazon Prime, but don't &#34;invest in buying it&#34;.  There was some good acting and cute lines.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|While I was hesitant to read Entwined after all of the backlash when released I had to be fair to myself and make my own judgement...I'm glad I did!<br /><br />I actually loved this book and felt that it was a good character building book for Gideon and Eva. It helped me understand them better and brought to life more of their pasts and what needs to be fixed for their future. There were struggles with trust and how they felt about each other and those from their past (Corrine and Brett). I actually loved the end and didn't feel like I was totally left hanging honestly.<br /><br />Is there more story to tell? Yes. There is a LOT more story to tell in my opinion. I am not a spoiler fan but I will say that there are many new angles and plots to Gideon and Eva's journey...and I look forward to it!<br /><br />I will not give details, you should read it for yourself and make your own judgement. I'm happy I did...
1781162646|5.0|I loved this book, read it in 2 days could have read it in one and had to stop myself so I didn't finish it so fast. Its a great tale of growing up and realizing things about your life while at the same time having a great mystery plot to it that doesn't overpower. The main character goes through things most of us go through in our early twenties with a great mystery mixed in, highly suggest it to anyone who is a king fan or just a fan of good books in general.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It was very easy to watch and entertaining! I can't wait to watch season 2!! Must fine other shows to watch until then. :(
B00196YNWU|5.0|Have seen the newer version as well as a play. This by far is THE best! We all loved it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I got the book (ebook version)<br />To my surprise, I could not stop reading the book!<br />It is super easy to read and so easy to understand character's feelings and what they are going through.<br />This genre is usually not my favorite to read, but this book was awesome!!!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I need to view it in 3-D. Did not. It was a very interesting story. Rather difficult to keep up with.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|ok<br />Not as good as the original<br />Language and some of the dancing are a bit explicit -- not great for young kids
B000FC1HBY|4.0|An excellent continuation if the story begun in A Game of Thrones.<br />The characters are various and numerous and each story diverse and interesting. Martin builds driving tension with an epic plot. This book is difficult to put down.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I hear form my brother-in-law Norman and from my son and daughter that this new Daft Punk CD is not loved by the band's older fans, the one's who have been waiting for over half a decade for a new DF release. This is indeed unfortunate for them! I love this new CD. However, I must admit that, although I am familiar with much of the band's older music I have never been a big fan. It isn't that I disliked the music. On the contrary, I usually really enjoyed the songs but for one reason or another I didn't invest my time in exploring it in detail. When I went to Amazon a couple of weeks ago to see what music was \\"hot\\" I saw this CD at the top of the popularity list so I proceeded to the reviews and was mightily impressed with what I read. It wasn't so much that there were so many raves but what these reviewers were saying - elements of disco, jazz and soul, real instruments and interesting collaborations. I was intrigued, listened to the CD on You Tube and ordered it the same day.  It has now arrived.<br /><br />I have thousands of CDs and LPs, 74 days of music in my iTunes  blah blah and feel guilty when I play one CD multiple times during one week - after all, if I'm listening to one CD over and over I'm neglecting everything else and there are so many hours in a day and years in a lifetime! Well, gotta say that I have played this CD a number of times in the few days since it arrived. I just love it. It's so infectiously delectable. I like the different styles of music equally. Track one says it all, \\"Give Life Back to Music\\". What a great beginning to a record, both lyrically and musically. Lovely driving disco/funk beat. Giorgio, with the spoken segments could have so easily become pretentious. Instead, it is addictive, so dance-able. It's my favourite song of the moment. Giorgio tells a good story - no preconceptions, no-one told him what to do, thus.... The last minute is like a magnificent fireworks display. The CD goes from strength to strength. How can anyone sit or stand still to Lose Yourself to Dance? Or Get Lucky? The theatrical Touch comes out of left field and there veers hither and thither for eight glorious minutes.<br /><br />Random Access Memories is the CD of the year, so far. It is the most alive and exciting music that I've heard in an age.sit or stand still to Lose Yourself to Dance? Or Get Lucky?

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there were more levels and the graphics were better. overall a very fun game! Hope they come out with more soon
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book.<br />I enjoyed every minute of the book.<br />Keep me going to the very last page.<br />Now want to see the movie
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|Why didn't this do better in the threatre?  My son loved it and it must have been excellent on the big screen.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great film and of course great acting.  I thought about this movie for several days after I watched it.  It is heart wrenching from start to finish.  Such a play on your emotions to watch the characters struggle with addiction and what it does to their lives.  I didn't know beforehand, but this is a film about addiction, mainly alcoholism.  Denzel Washington is awesome and I find this role to be as powerful as his role in The Hurricane.  **The plane crash is terrifying and might seal the deal for someone afraid of flying!**  Also, the first few minutes of the movie are full frontal, sorry it's not Denzel.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is a great android game. It's kind of mindless, but the graphics are fun, and the gameplay is well designed.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This was a great show to watch with my little grand sons. We all loved it and it gave us an opportunity for me to share some of my memories of these wonderful guardians from my past as well.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Awesome series. Never a dull moment as well as great cast. Can't wait to get the rest of the seasons. Five thumbs up!!!!
B00356CO1E|5.0|Just did my first Level 1 workout, and it was fantastic. Seems like a really efficient 20 minutes. There's NO rest in this workout, but it's just 20 minutes, so I always felt like there was a light at the end of the tunnel. It's tough, and great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Purchasing and reading this book has been one of best choices i have made! It is brilliantly written and incredibly addictive. I fell in love with each character and i cant simply stop reading it. I love the way John Green treats the topic of kids with cancer in the story and how there is no sugar coating the topic. Even if i was heartbroken by the passing of one of the main characters, i knew that there couldn't have been another way to end this story. Oh, and I'm totally obsessed with Hazel & Augustus, there couldn't have made a better couple and i just simply love everything about them. I really recommend people to read this book. You will not regret buying it ;).
1582701709|3.0|As a person who suffered from mental illness until technology in the form of a VSN brain pacemaker (Cyberonics) came about to help me, I was deeply disappointed that the Secret did not include one serious form of mental illness, or even one  minor mental illness, while including serious physical illness and serious physical injury.  Why did the author and other \\"teachers\\" did not include serious mental illness?  Is it because the Secret does not work well with the mentally ill?  Nothing, absolutely nothing was mentioned regarding mental illness, which is so serious in our country at the moment that it is a major topic in Congress as to what to do about it.  Because of this, I was just not impressed with the Secret.  It seems to work for \\"normal\\" people with no genetic disposition to serious/minor mental illness, but how many \\"normal\\" people are there in this world?  I preferred the book 8 Keys by Linda West.  While somewhat similar to the Secret, it was more realistic in that you could expect chaos to come too in your life as it changes, though there were parts of it I had to disagree with as well.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is super fun and very affordable since it is free. This game combines my favorite movie and my favorite type of game. It is also fun for all ages of kids.I recommend this game for everyone.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so let down by book 3. I over looked a lot in Book 2 and jumped into Book 3 with both feet...ready to get some some ANSWERS about Mr. Cross and his issues, some storyline, some laughs. What I got was every other page of sex, sex and more sex-like THAT'S going to resolve their relationship issues-and then you have Eva wanting to be FRIENDS with an ex who she doesn't even really REMEMBER what her relationship with him was like to begin with. REALLY!??!!!? WHY are you kissing this man?!?! And RESPONDING!????!!!! Seriously?!? When you've got \\"Mr. in a class by himself\\" there beside you at your beck and call. I don't get it. Now I find out that Ms. Brown is stretching this series into a 5 PART SERIES. WHAT?!?!!?!!! At this point I think I could really walk away from this story. If I DON'T finish this series (which I am LOATHE to do-I REALLY don't like to not know what happened with story line once it starts. I want to finish-even when it pains me sometimes.)I think I could really be okay with it. Which is sad. This series started with such promise. This 3rd book was basically just a book of how many times can we have sex and how many differant ways can the author describe it. After a while you just start glazing over and saying-really?? This girl shouldn't even be able to WALK right now-much less have sex AGAIN. The plot for this book was thin at best. If you're looking for answers you won't find any. Just more questions raised and not answered. And the suspense...well...it's just kinda running in circles now. I wish I could get my ten dollars back. I would gladly return the book. I definely won't recommend it. And I'm sad to know that I will probably break down and spend the money to finish the story. It looks like I have some time to think about whether or not I will actually commit or not. One of my friends keeps recommending FSoG. I haven't read that because I thought this series would be better. Seems like I may have to follow her advise-maybe that storyline will be better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good and it updates itself I recommend it because you will never get bored of it also it is really fun
B0019M06JS|4.0|If you like Bossa Nova, then you will like this album.  If you like<br />romance and a lilting style, this album is easy listening.  She<br />has a deeper voice than Astrid Gilberto, but it is this deeper<br />side that adds a warm and glow to the music.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Very very fun this game I'm a level 13 can not stop playing it<br />I recommend people should play this game it is fun
B00908DDZM|5.0|The wide array of songs makes it a great album for listening to in completion.  And I love that there's an instrumental song that highlight's Ryan Lewis's work
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I am glad Disney decided NOT to change the look of this princess she is now my favorite one; her spunk and charm is part of her appeal.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|my kid watches this movie over and over again. I like it too. Highly recommended . The story line teaches children about where these tropical birds originate  .FUN MOVIE
B003WMA7BU|2.0|The blessed shortness of this book. I suppose I have a bit of an idea about Driver`s childhood as a predictor of his adult life, but I honestly don't care about this man or anything about his violent existence. I have not seen the movie, but this seems to me to be an author trying to be \\"noir cool,\\" with a disjointed narrative which darted rapidly back and forth through time, without even one strong thread sewn into this patchwork garment to make much sense out of anything. But hey, thanks for the quick read, which was the sole reason for the second star.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun you get to killl people.<br />so if you fell like you are in a hole this game will help you out.
B00BYISQTO|3.0|The National's 2010 album, 'High Violet', made my choice for Record of the Year.  It is still a great album and the songs that were my least favourite (though never bad), \\"Terrible Love\\", Vanderlyle Crybaby\\" are now my go-to songs.<br /><br />So when the band \\"surprisingly\\" announced a few months ago that they had completed a new album, I was stoked.  Yes...I just said \\"stoked\\".<br /><br />I went and pre-ordered 'Trouble Will Find Me', months before it was released. It got me an immediate download of one of their song, \\"Demons\\".  With that song, the album wasn't off to an auspicious start.  You have to get to minute two of a three and one half minute song before there is any kind of melody.<br /><br />I know that Matt Berninger's baritone can make for challenging lead singer material, but the band has always made it work in the past.  I held off on judgement until listening to the entire disk.<br /><br />With their previous releases, some of their appeal came from their whimsical rhythm section and the occasional understated horns and strings.  The drumming here is fine, but doesn't have that certain 'catch' that Bryan Devendorf has become known for. That drumming would literally make me smile - even unknowingly at first.  I'm not getting that this go-round.<br /><br />With 'Trouble Will Fine Me', they deliver a perfectly serviceable album, but it's nothing outstanding.  I like that they don't try to make it out to be more than it is.<br /><br />On 'High Violet' or 'Boxer', any number of songs immediately jumped out as appealing.  There is nothing like that here.  The closest they come is \\"Humiliation\\", \\"Sea of Love\\"and \\"Don't Swallow the Cap\\".<br /><br />But the songs, overall, are not overly melodic.  That's the best way to describe them. Not that 'melodic' is a great descriptor for the National, but their songs had a certain sing-a-long-able-ness to them.  Not so much with this grouping.<br /><br />Even for Berninger's baritone, the music is a little monotone too - even more so than usual.  There is little hook and if there is any kind of musical change-up, it comes at least two minutes into the song, and by that time you're losing interest.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't read other reviews before finishing mine, but I could not help but seeing the majority of them being 5-star and I wasn't sure what I was missing - so I read.  I'm still not getting 5-star anything with any one song, let alone an overall disk.<br /><br />I've been playing this album on and off for three weeks now and it is more than fine to listen to while doing other things, but their other disks would make me stop and really listen and replay and replay and replay.  'Trouble Will Find Me' isn't doing that.<br /><br />...at least not yet.- even more so than usual.

B00CC8789O|5.0|One of the best action movies in the world. Cant wait til I see part six. It will be awesome.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|It turns out acting IS important, even in an action thriller.  Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon and consequently, Aaron Cross is no Jason Bourne.  Renner doesn't have a compelling screen presence in this type of film, which will come as no surprise to those who saw him in the Avengers or MI: Ghost Protocol.<br /><br />Renner's character wasn't much to work with, either.  At one point, he confesses to innate stupidity if he doesn't take his super soldier pills.  With Bourne, one always had the sense he was an exceptional individual to begin with, pushed to his potential by extraordinary (and twisted) training.  The audience is cheering for a natural champion fighting off his oppressors.  In the Bourne Legacy, we are supposed to cheer for a dim-witted government employee rebelling against the people that saved him from mediocrity.  Yes, those people are evil, but in this movie, it's hard to care.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I have this app on my iphone as well as my kindle fire. the game is different on my phone, there is more things available than on the kindle. very annoying they aren't the same! please fix! I love playing this game
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  It has very soothing music and several instruments that are equally calming.  I love the choices that are on this app.  I highly recommend this app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! It was like a romantic comedy. I literally could not put the book down! Easily the best book I ever read
0425263924|5.0|Out of all 3 books this is the best !! But I do love the first 2. The part I didn't like is the ending !!! Now I can't wait for the next book!!! She called it a trilogy but it's not because she just lift you hanging!!! I just hope it doesn't take a year for the next one!! I just love Gideon and Eva!!! Couldn't put this book down!!! It is such a wonderful love story of two very broken people!! On every turn someone would put another block in their way!! But Gideon and Eva always seem to get around it ( barely )!! Really can't wait till the next book !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0037472NY|4.0|It's a great book until it gets lame about three quarters through. All in all, I'd rate it as good.
B0006J28L4|3.0|I was hoping for an exciting history lesson and I got a blah history lesson. I do now know more about Malcolm X and his importance, but the entire first disc was pretty boring. Things picked up a bit in the second disc. I also liked that Spike Lee didn't glorify X, nor did he disparage him. The story seemed to be just the story of a man, not a super-hero (as some bios tend to skew).
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I just finished Mockingjay and I was amazing!! It took me awhile to finish it but I finally did. The epilogue was very sad, to me at least
0062059963|5.0|Best book in a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time, a MUST read. the perfect mix of a future world and royalty and don't forget romance!
B004SB60OC|5.0|Such a hauntingly sweet voice. Hope she's found peace and happiness! I love &#34;Jar of Hearts&#34; That is why I bought but now I like all her songs!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I wish I could give this app better but every time I attempt to open it it say's Vtube has stopped unexpecteadlly
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Book was excellent. Why the changes? Why the less peeps and extra peeps? Hollywood always seems to have a better story and political solutions. Tom was great, as always.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. Super fast and excellent read! Well written - will definitely be reading her other books.
B007ZYJT1U|1.0|This movie starts out with the ultimate cruelty to a dog by a drunk. Sick flick. Probably art for the enlightened, but not for peeps with dogs.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Last installment for the Christopher Nolan series. The DVD combo is great if you don't always have a blu-ray player access.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|We found this fact-based story about Bethany Hamilton and her family and friends to be very well worth watching. The performances in particular and the movie as a whole were stellar. If you have a warmth of heart, it will be thoroughly engaged. At first my wife didn't want to see the movie at all because she knew that she would be crying throughout most of it (being a protective mom/grandma and a teary tender-heart), but after our daughters previewed it, they finally convinced their mom that overall the movie and true story are ultimately uplifting. A triumph over great difficulties. A story of faith, love, support and courage. My wife ended up watching the movie with tears throughout and after the tragedy, yes, but ended feeling positive and nurtured because of the way this amazing girl and her family handled everything and have forged forward to give of themselves to others around the world. Bravo to Bethany and her family for sharing this story in this way (and themselves in many other ways), to the fine actors and to the excellent Director - brilliantly done all the way around. Share the love and goodness. Tell your friends about this gem.
B0064MGU98|5.0|In my opinion...this is a well written witty drama. I am late to the series but enjoying catching up. Really enjoying the series.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is a brilliant film on a number of levels, well directed, written, and acted. It is especially relevant today, as it shines light on what happens to people in a society when the government is keeping tabs on everyone and everything they do or say can potentially be used against them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great if u like to take care of animals and don't have anything else to do. It is also great for kids and little children. My cousin was playing on it and loved it.
0425252868|5.0|Bought this book for my dad at Christmas time. He just texted me to thank me for being a great daughter who knows what her dad likes. He finished it with \\"tears in my eyes\\", \\"truly inspirational\\".
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|Excellent story from an excellent writer.  Quirky and fun, yet deep in its message.  Definitely should check it out - plus it's free!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|:) was an amazing game. Like the little monkey helper. Graphics are cool. Love the hidden objects games. Would recommend to anyone
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I think Cheryl Strayed is a gifted writer and I enjoyed the  book for the most part.  I found it a bit like &#34;Eat Pray Love&#34; - a bit too much naval-gazing and self-absorption but was also quite moving at times.
1452111014|5.0|This book is like many other cartoon a good reference. lot of sketches. Very colorful. I think it's interesting to have it.
0316067601|5.0|Marcus does an excellent job of describing his training and subsequent mission and the Faith that got him through that failed mission.  I found myself wanting to turn each page to see what would happen next.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Well, so this is the end of this series and I am sorry to see it go but I must say that if our author had to end it she did a great job wrapping it all up and not leaving us any loose ends.<br />I appreciate that!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Another tour de force by Hosseini's pen.  Beautifully crafted, spellbinding at times, consistently engaging.  One of those books one takes on vacation for a guaranteed good read that has the extra plus of educating the reader to historical events and current affairs.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|3 way stylus is a great tool to have.  I love it and use it on my Kindle Fire HD and Samsung Galaxy 4.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Great artists and very soothing music to drive with. A good mix of older and newer singers.<br />Nice to hear an artist like Paul is still performing.
0425263924|1.0|Although I really liked the first two books, book 3 made me extremely annoyed. Not only are you left hanging, Ms Day clearly had no intention of wrapping this story up. I would rather sit and read a book that has 1,000 pages than go through the misery of waiting for an author to finish the next &#34;chapter&#34;, then have it just keep going. I actually purchased the first 2 books a couple months ago and waited for the 3rd so I could read them together. A huge waste of money....plus, for anyone that read A Dark Kiss of Rapture, you know that we've been waiting since February for Kim & Raze's story to continue in A Lush Kiss of Surrender. Now, I don't really care and will no longer invest in any other of Sylvia Day's books. I really enjoyed Fifty Shades and at least EL James gave the characters an ending that made sense.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I think all parents must think about what kind of person their child is, have I given them the tools to make the right decisions - are they capable of making the right decisions. This story was like the inside of a parent's mind- wondering, but only so far...wanting to fully support, as if having a belief that may be negative about the child is NOT supportive. Well written , a great read!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is one of the funniest games ive ever played.  its temple run but. but just with weapons and people u have to go against
B0045HCJT4|5.0|Soldier is a movie that has a lot of action but also has heart.  I especially enjoy a movie that can touch me and this movie did just that.  That's why I bought it.  I can watch this movie every once in awhile and still enjoy it as much as I did the first time I watched it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Great cd. I love Buffy and music here is really good. Very emotional and deep and fits with the show perfectly. The singing is great and the quality of sound is really good. A must have for any Buffy fan.
0783225547|5.0|Dante's Peak a favorite movie of mine.  I really do enjoy a good disaster movie and this particular movie is really well done..  The special effects and CGI  are exceptional.  The acting is good by all.<br />When the volcano blows, it is quite believable.  I bought it because when I worked at a video store,  I would take this one home to watch often.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I love all of the Die Hard movies but this one. I don't really consider this a part of the Die Hard series because the character of John McClane plays more like a grumpy old man than an action hero.  His &#34;son&#34;, while easy ont the eyes, doesn't seem mature enough to be in the CIA.  He's a brat with a gun, who I kept hoping would go away.  John McCain is supposed to be smart, funny and in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This was a John McCain who needed family counseling and a xanax.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|A strange album. It pulsates more than any other Boards of Canada album, every song nearly flows into the next, and ends smoothly. Overall, I think its less dark than Campfire Headphase, but not as bright as Music Has a Right to Children. By the third or fourth time playing it, it sounds different. I noticed subtleties -melodies, etc.- that I hadn't before. I realized I like the new sound.  I think this album will grow in popularity over time.<br />Here's my break down of the songs I like, for what it's worth.<br /><br />GEMINI: Opens with the National Geographic Board of Canada documentary sound. Cold, atmospheric and pulsating.<br /><br />REACH FOR THE DEAD:At first I didn't really like this song, because I wanted to hear something like Everything You Do Is A Balloon after such a long BoC hiatus. However, this song grows on you. It's soft, pining, atmospheric nostalgic yet new sounding. Because it was released before everything else, I found my self listening to it most. Now it's easily one of my favorite songs. Great replay-ability.<br /><br />COLD EARTH: Classic boards of canada sound. Like the Geogaddi album, the song Olson, etc.<br /><br />PALACE POSY: My favorite song on the album as of now. Has that heavy beat sound of SixtyTen (and Everything you do is a balloon's shuffle beat) for the first 2:30. Then switches it up into the heavy beat sound mixed with a nostalgic voice melody. Upbeat ish. Great drums.<br /><br />NOTHING IS REAL: This song reminds me most of Music Has a Right to Children and Campfire Headphase.<br /><br />NEW SEEDS: This song contends with Palace Posy and Reach for the Dead as my most favorite song. Palace Posy I think is better overall. But this song is a close second. Has an great ending/outro starting at 4:00 minutes in.) for the first 2:30. Then switches it up into the heavy beat sound mixed with a nostalgic voice melody. Upbeat ish. Great drums.<br /><br />Split Your Infinities<br />I read the name of the song and was excited to hear it. Cool sounding name. But it's okay, I was not really into it. Smooth and lounge sounding.<br /><br />Uritual<br />The X-Files song part deux. Starts witha  pulsating, buzzing, alien sound that progresses through the whole song.<br /><br />Nothing is Real<br />This song reminds me most of Music Has a Right to Children and Campfire Headphase.<br /><br />Sundown<br />A sort of intermission song. Long mystical sounding drones.<br /><br />New Seeds<br />This song contends with Palace Posy and Reach for the Dead as my most favorite song. Palace Posy I think is better overall. But this song is a close second. Has an great ending/outro starting at 4:00 minutes in.<br /><br />Come to Dust<br />I read from a BoC interview this song is a reprise of Reach for the Dead. Sounds almost in reverse, and slowed down.<br /><br />Semena Mertvykh<br />Strong pulsating drones and minimal strings. Dark, desert, end.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />The first play through, I thought it was \\"okay\\". I was not as impressed with it as I was with Campfire Headphase, Music Has a Right to Children, or Trans-Canada Highway (fav). However, I found myself ALWAYS playing it in the background. By the third or fourth time playing it, it sounded different. I noticed subtleties -melodies, etc.- that I hadn't before. I realized I like the new sound.  I think this album will grow in popularity over time.<br /><br />Very happy to have new Boards of Canada music.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Much like her other books, Kate Morton spins tales of secrets that keep you reading far into the night. This book spanned several years and kept you hanging on.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game! Can't get enough! Its fun and the people who play are great! I highly Recommen this game!!
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|This is Alice in Chains, Black gives way to blue is Alice in Chains, Jerry, Sean, Mike and William are Alice in chains as much as Layne, Mike, Sean and Jerry were back in the day. This band is truer to their sound and essence today 25 years later than any other band from the grunge era that I can think of. Pearl Jam and Smashing pumpkins have aged and changed an even as they remain great acts and put out good albums you can palpate the change from their heyday. With Alice, they have matured, they have grown old, they have lost two loved and dear band members, but still to this day remain as AiC as ever. Is the album classic, how does it stand compared to their previous albums? Well in my opinion no it is not a classic and it can see in the eye any other alice album. It is a great piece of modern and adult grunge and I wouldn't take it any other way. If you have been neglecting AiC since their unplugged album... boy! you are missing on so much...<br />To recap as another reviewer stated \\"If it's good enough for Jerry it is good enough for me\\"
B004KPQK2S|5.0|We could watch Secretariat over and over again. His history-making story is well-told and the superfluous stuff is left out, thankfully. We get to know this amazing creature and the team who believed in him and it needs no extra fluff. Perfect family movie with no gratuitous violence or foul language (unless you can understand French).
0099519852|3.0|I started at a busy time in my life which may be why I didn't finish it. But also I found the writing to be dry and take forever to get to the point. If you like long drawn out narratives with lots of detail you would like this. If you are more of a to the point type I bet you'll get bored too.
B00008IHN1|5.0|I'm not one for football movies, but when I saw this one I thought of my brother who was a drummer in his band and he use to be in the High school band. I told him he should see this and I lent it to him. We both agreed this was a terrific movie of want a football band would have to do and the drummer was the main person in this story.<br /> It kept my attention all the way through, and that is really something for me to see and watch. I really have to say it's a great movie.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I got a bit bored about 45 minutes into this movie. I do not think it was really worth watching.
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|An exciting movie which played flawlessly, it makes Amazon Prime well worth the price, I hardly ever watch Netflix anymore.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Like many, I was riveted by The Hunger Games.  I found it profoundly shocking, engaging, and could not tear myself away from it, reading it in a single sitting.  I agree it is a new classic in YA literature. Ms. Collins' world is complex and complete, well thought out, and describes a society that is believable, shockingly so.<br /><br />The rest of the trilogy, while still entertaining, lacked the same punch.  I suspect this may be because the initial shock at the world introduced in The Hunger Games may have worn off a bit by then.  I was just not as emotionally engaged.  Then again, I am 20+ years older than the target audience for these books, and just found the love triangle aspect annoying rather than interesting as a plot device.<br /><br />I strongly recommend reading The Hunger Games (first book), and if you are going to do that, it would probably be best to buy the trilogy, as I am pretty sure you will wonder what happened next.  Just don't expect the next two books to have the same punch, or you will be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Great app. works Great on Kindle Fire HD. Have not had any problems. I can post from Kindle Fire and see all my pages at a touch of my finger. FB shows up as if I was on my PC.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey does not just create a story or a world in his Wool saga, he creates a vision of an entire society.  (More than one, actually, but you will have to read it all to see what I mean by that.)  Set at some point in the future, his characters live in a world where the ultimate sin is to ever want to leave.  How and why things got that way is the crux of the story, so I will skip the spoilers.<br /><br />Mr. Howey's world is rich, complex, and engaging, but his stories read at warp speed.  There is enough detail to fully build his world without leaving the reader mired in the minutiae that so often seems to bog stories like these down.<br /><br />Mr. Howey has decided to go the route of self-publishing, and while in general this has made me cringe a bit on Amazon, in this case, it hasn't been a mistake.  His books have been well edited, are tightly plotted, and are an overall good read.  There are a couple (very few) small typographic errors to be found, but unlike many of the independent works, they do not detract from the story, and are almost unnoticeable as the reader absorbs his prose.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the Wool Omnibus, and all of the works which followed.  In my humble opinion, Mr Howey has written a classic on par with Soylent Green or the works of George Orwell.  I suspect the greater publishing world is beginning to notice that, as I have heard Wool mentioned on NPR and outside of the Kindle/Amazon community.<br /><br />Strongly recommend this book.
1451695195|3.0|A bit lightweight. The Book of Revelation  describing heaven is a lot more exciting!  Also the book is geared to one who is a nonbeliever/atheist rather than to the believer.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very cool if you've ever wanted to feel like Tony Stark. I've  played other apps before that just seem like they'll suck your wallet until you reach a certain level. This one doesn't seem like that at all.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Love her style of writing; slowly building the story going from one character to the other-each time filling in the story till it builds to the ending.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The first book in the series is the best, in my opinion. A new concept that keeps you hooked from the beginning.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Are you kidding?  This is for everyone!  It is Patrick Swayze at his very hunk best.  Who cares about a real story line, though there is a small one.  You Love, Love, Love the dancing.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Oh I am so so glad I stumbled upon this book. It was just what I was looking for...perfect combination of sexy, funny, romantic, & steamy. Great read!!
B001DUDKEY|3.0|It was very hard to follow the story line.  In fact, I looked up a synopsis of the book to figure out what had happened.  Would not watch again.
B005HED11Y|5.0|It is great to watch the old stories look like<br />they were just filmed with today's technology.<br />You feel like you are actually looking into space<br />and seeing the beauty of it all.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|This is the best of all the old Star Trek Movies with the original crew.  Anyone that grew up in the 80's would appreciate the time line.  I grew up in the 60's and I love it.  It has comedy, suspense, action and a little bit of mystery thrown in.  My favorite line is from Kirk when they all get off the spaceship - 'Everyone, don't forget where we parked.'  I promise you will not be disappointed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't know where to begin?!? I've loved them all through through the series. I kept telling myself reading this book that this was NO WAY the last book, there wasn't enough time!! There's way too much to be told and said, of course I was right!! I really hope it's soon tho bc when a new book comes out I always re read all the books just so I'm in the zone and omg I just can't believe it! Great writing Sylvia!! YOU ROCK!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I hope the book was better because I found the movie tiresome in spots.  I had to watch to see how it came out, but it was ho hum.
B003U4ZQRK|4.0|Extremely convoluted and riveting. Keeps you glued to the screen until the last episode of the last season. Would definitely watch again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|To start, let me say this book definitely left me wanting more! I know some people are upset that the trilogy has turned into a 5 book series but I think more of Mr. Cross is always a good thing!  There are a few surprises along the way, some good and some not so good, which result in several cliffhangers in Entwined with You. It will be interesting to see how Gideon and Eva deal with certain situations that have arisen. And Cary, poor Cary, that's all I can say about Eva's BFF. I can't wait for the next books to see how this journey ends for everyone. I feel like if you can overlook the fact that this was supposed to be the final book, you will enjoy it and be ready to continue the journey in the next installments.
B006L7S8YG|5.0|This was a perfect gift for my granddaughters' high school graduation!<br />It is in such a nice box folder that it will last forever!
B00004XPPC|1.0|Very disappointed since this CD came cracked so I could not view it.<br />Don't think you can return thses items once they have been opened.<br />Just didn't bother, but will not purchase similar items in the future.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Really loved this album, you can definitely say this sounds uncanny to the psychedelic sounding beatle period of Sgt Pepper & the Magical Mystery tour with some early pink floyd mixed in. The lead singer sounds almost exactly to same as John Lennon. Elephant,Mind Mischief & feels like we only go backwards are awesome sounds but the whole album is good as a whole. Definitely look forward to hearing more from these guys!
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|Great cast it's where it went that was wrong. So many could have been brought in more and made it really funny and Mike Tyson at the end, nope, wrong itdea completely.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I understand wanting to extend the story so you can get more books published, but the way this book ended was a cop out and frankly a bit pathetic. Will think long and hard about whether or not to spend money on the next one.
B00973902K|5.0|Everyone knows this song, right?  Seems every Karaoke bar in the world has it on their top 10.  It's a fun song, is easy to jam to, and great for practicing your improv skills on a guitar.  There are enough gaps in it just begging for an arpeggio or scale run.  The chord structure is simple enough to figure out, even using open chords.<br /><br />An amp with an aux in and your MP3 player, and you're set!  Be creative!

B008YWY0HK|4.0|A very, very well done movie.  I will be adding it to my collection of &#34;must have&#34; DVDs.  The price was better than any local stores and the shipping was less than the local sales tax.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game lets you obtain dragons, raise them, breed them, and make friends!<br />This allows you to explore dragons in ways you might never have thought of.<br />I would recommend this game to ANY game player.
B009AMANBA|5.0|A very, very well done movie.  I will be adding it to my collection of &#34;must have&#34; DVDs.  The price was better than any local stores and the shipping was less than the local sales tax.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was sad when I heard this would be the last Sookie book. I enjoyed the series but I must say I was disappointed with this last book.  You can tell Harris ran out of ideas to make her books fun and exciting.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Never watched the original Star Trek on TV but I got into it by watching the Voyager series. I always enjoyed all the movies with the original crew and the show is good but the special effects are not the greatest. What would you expect from a 1960's show anyway.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|fawlty towers is the best comedy ever made in my humble opinion. this collection is the best bet for your money and has all 12 episodes. the only problem is just that, there are only 12 episodes.  even still i re-watch them ever other week and they are still funny.  plus, due to the high brow nature of the gigs, i would almost venture to say this is fun for the whole family.
0061726834|5.0|Love it and cant wait to read the other books. Was a very fast read Oliver did a great job of putting into words the feeling of falling in love.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Edit after a year: I was wrong. You CAN transfer accounts, and also the Storm8 system and customer service for doing this has **dramatically** improved. You need to know the following to transfer:<br />Storm8 ID (not your island name)<br />Gold amount<br />Coin amount<br />Food amount<br /><br />I did actually stop playing for a lot of months, but I was very ill and started checking in again. The is a rewarding game if you only look at it 1-2 times a day, and not wanting to rush long (often day long) waits for everything. Also if you don't mind on sometimes missing out on breeding a specific limited dragon.<br /><br />There have been \\"sales\\" on gold more often, for 30% less, but remember that there is no manufacturer cost involved for the gold, so that no matter the price 100% of what you pay is the developer profit.<br /><br />There are a lot more dragons offered now, and more often. If you would like an idea, do a search for the game wiki, (\\"dragonstory wiki breeding calculator\\"), which is not associated with Storm8, it's fan run, but rather thorough anyway.<br /><br />Huge, huge improvements to the game, customer service, and ease of game transfers. So four stars for the game, and the extra up to five stars for rapid improvements.<br />Cheers Storm8!<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER TWO MONTHS: I had to replace my Kindle... And the game data and account are NOT TRANSFERABLE. Even though you MUST be online to play, you cannot reuse your Storm8ID or transfer the level/dragons/coins/gold et cetera. HUGELY disappointing after reaching level 43 to have all that gone forever. Very very wrong, frankly, to require an online connection but not have the game saved for you. It makes me wonder -why- the game has to be constantly online, then...<br /><br />I have only started, but it looks like a lot of stuff costs gold which you have to pay cash for. Seriously, 3k gold for $100? Who can afford this game? If you know other wise, please, let me know if it's worth continuing playing.<br/><br />The graphics are great. And I noticed that it's more cost effective, although frustrating, to plant the berries. I love my dragons... I just hope they don't eat each other or something while I can't afford to feed them to upgrade their habitats.<br /><br />Update after two weeks: This game is very playable without cash. Gold can be given to three friends per day, that's how you build up more gold. The game progress is steady, with such high gold costs to finish building, expanding, clearing, and growing that it is prohibitive for people who would want to pay their way through.<br /><br />I have succumbed, and gotten $30 in gold to buy a huge habitat. Plus to speed up some evolutions and nestings, and buy coins and food. But Im in a holding pattern now, being patient.<br /><br />Really this game is about PATIENCE and COMMITMENT. You should visit it a couple times a day to play with friend's dragons, which increases your showing in the community, and both get you more visits, more bonuses from visits, and more friends. But be _patient_ and set the game down for the night with some dragons breeding, nesting, and evolving, so when you wake up everything is ready.<br /><br />There is an excellent wiki for the game, but it kind of makes you want to do more faster, so try to just use it to look up how to get dragons you want. Which the wiki says, requires patience.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of selling off baby dragons for space, though at least wait until they've repaid the breeding cost.<br /><br />Patience Patience Patience!

B0090KZDSK|5.0|loved Eva and Gideon and the way their relationship progressed. loved how they grew with one another... could not put the book down and found the pages turning themselves. yes they made mistakes but it just made their characters more real and better loved. suggest reading at least the last chapter of book 2  as this book doesnt skip a beat and dives right back into the story!! so excited for the next 2 books
B005S9ELVC|4.0|These guys who acted are too young , most of the guys in those days were in their late 30's or early 40's most of the film was pure fantasy.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Nobody does it better than LeCarre, though I found none of the characters convincing. I'm always suspicious of people who can instantly speak in paragraphs, entertaining though they may be. However, it's certainly a thrilling and fast paced plot, and leaves one uncertainly perched on the last page. NOBODY in this novel ever says what they mean, except towards the end, and we see just how dangerous that can be!
B00908DDZM|5.0|This guy is amazing. Really cool songs and then the videos are so creative. Has a good message - especially thrift shop. $50 for a t-shirt? Nope I don't think so. He has $20 and gets cool stuff cheap at the thrift shop. Sends a great message to youth of today about the value of money and being stylish on a budget. Why line the pockets of designers when you can look awesome and unique from the thrift shop?

B004X6PRO6|4.0|An excellent choice for the Pulitzer.  So good it makes up for last year's non-award.  More like a 4.5*.  The ending didn't quite do it justice.  But that's just nitpicking.<br />If only half of what's written about life in DPRK is true, it's still worse than anything we Americans have to deal with.

B00CE03UOC|5.0|This app is really soothing and relaxing... if your looking for a relaxing mind- freeing game this is a game for you...

B006LSZECO|1.0|Waste of time. Ends up like a comic book of mysteries. Would not recommend it to anyone. Don't buy it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This started out as such a fun and engaging series, but the last two or three books have been really weak, and this is little better.  It wraps everything up all nicely and neatly, but is not much fun to read along the way.  It's an easy read, though, so if you're looking to kill some time, by all means.  I'm disappointed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One more for story....but with a younger action hero. The book is well written and the story is easy to follow and intersting. A must for the fans....
0156027321|5.0|I'm sure you have read many different stories about castaways and getting lost at sea. Titanic, Gilligan's Island, Castaway, Swiss Family Robinson, and the TV show Lost. All of these and many others are unique in their own way. However, have you ever heard of one that involves a young boy alone? And if you have, have you heard of a story about a young boy floating at sea, with a live Bengal Tiger?<br /><br />The novel, Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, tells such a tale. The main character is Pi Patel, and he is the protagonist because he is the only relatable character. He is also the narrator; he saves himself and the tiger, and learns a lot about himself and life during the course of the novel. Another character is Richard Parker, (the Bengal tiger), and he is important to the story because he is the only other character on the boat with Pi and keeps Pi alive.<br /><br />The conflict that these characters are facing is that Pi is lost at sea, for 227 days, in a lifeboat, with a 450-pound Bengal tiger and depleting food and water with no end in sight.<br />This story begins in India. Pi has a mother, a father, a brother, family friends, and many people he looks up to. He finishes school early, and looks for new excitement. As a 16-year-old, he adopts three religions; Hinduism, Christianity, and Muslimism. This gives him a different perspective on life, and even though his mother and father don't support this decision, they do not protest. His father owns a zoo. The Patel family decides to move from india to Canada, by ship with some of their zoo animals, but unfortunately in the middle of the journey their boat sinks. Pi ends up on a lifeboat, with a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker. The hyena eats the zebra and the orangutan and then is killed by Richard Parker. Pi feels like he will not survive this journey with an active tiger, but then finds supplies in the boat and Richard Parker lets it be known that he will not be of harm to Pi. Pi fishesand gets adequate food and water for him and his companion, until they go blind from lack of nourishment. In that same time frame, they hear another castaway on a lifeboat, who is also blind, and Pi feels like he could have some hope until Richard Parker dismantles Pi's new friend. Other close encounters ensue, such as a ship that passes by but does not see their small boat and landing on a dangerous island that doesn't fit well to their human and animal needs. After 227 days, Pi and Richard Parker land in Mexico. This is where our friend's story ends.<br /><br />The ending of the book wasn't satisfying for me. Their conflict was resolved but not in the best way, because in my opinion, after all Pi went through, the interrogators he shares his story with should respect him more. He went through a lot, and by them not believing his story, it shows that everything he went though was all for nothing.<br /><br />There could be many different themes for this book. The first is that there is always more self-discovery to do. Before his life changing journey, Pi has three religions. He has learned a lot about himself and the quantities of life. During his experience, he must be alone. The only things he can rely on are his religions and his depleting sense of hope. Without these two, he would never have survived. He would have given up, stopped feeding himself, and not looked forward towards the possibilities that could arise. After his adventure, he discusses how he feels different. He has learned a lot about himself and the world and the harshness of things, which have changed him into a different person than the one we meet at the beginning.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this book because it wasn't boring. For example, it never had a dry moment, even when they were just floating around the ocean. The author only included parts of the story that were interesting to read.<br /><br />The book was predictable because we knew from the beginning that Pi would get rescued, as the book is told from Pi's point of view to a storyteller, and we occasionally get glimpses of that outside scene. The ending of the book was fulfilling due to the fact that you felt happy for them when they were finally out of their situation. The author designed this book so that you had a real bond with the characters, and you were rooting for their conflict to be resolved the entire time. My favorite parts were when Pi and Richard Parker bonded.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to others because it provided a new perspective on life. I truly feel that it changed my point of view, and so because of this I would rate it a 9.3 out of 10. Do not read this book if you get bored or frustrated easily. The style of writing was very clear and made it easy to enjoy the book. The characters were not villains, yet we knew them very well and learned to relate with them. The plot was a fantastic idea, even if it wasn't a true story, and in conclusion this book would be worth anyone's time to read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series displays fine acting, well developed characters, and a storyline that is truly interesting.  My wife and I are hooked.  Can't wait for more.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Like others have said, this game is NOT short. Took me several days off and on to complete it. Good mixture of hidden object, story, and puzzles. I really like a good puzzle and this game has several of a type i hadn't seen before. Looking forward to the sequel.
0449237567|5.0|I have been conducting a long march through science fiction novels [so much of what's in the movies is so bad], comparing and contrasting both contemporary and classic, as well as re-reading novels I read in my teens and 20s, over three decades ago, to see how they hold up.<br /><br />Recently I read [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]], specifically because it is being made into a movies, and I wanted the experience of the novel first;  I re-read [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]] for the same reason, and that was way better than when I had to read it in high school, and I enjoyed the movie as well on its own terms.  I also read [[ASIN:0765348276 Old Man's War]] because I recently read [[ASIN:B002LITRRQ Agent to the Stars]].  That is a VERY funny book.  Old Man's War, like Ender, is about the relentless killing of hostile aliens. They are fun on the action level, and maybe if I read more in each series they would be more thought provoking.<br /><br />And now I've finished Gods.  In contrast with the war novels, while there are aliens, nobody kills anybody.  This is a novel of ideas, and the conflict is between physicists: who gets credit for what, and who is looking at the long range consequences of scientific breakthroughs.  In this case, more lethal than even the thermonuclear bomb.<br /><br />Asimov, being the polymath that he was, and the author of hundreds of nonfiction books, imbues the story with real principals: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, the laws of thermodynamics and more.  You needn't understand any of it; at the very least it makes the dialogue sound realistic [for a really good example of cool science fiction dialogue, see [[ASIN:B00APQDPAQ Primer]], one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen].<br /><br />While it was published in the late 70s, it still seems contemporary: I thought of both global warming -- which was much less politically controversial in the 70s than it is now, and very much in keeping with the plot -- and the Large Hadron Collider. The prose is, well, prosaic, but it certainly doesn't detract from the story nor call attention to itself.  The characters are well defined, although the humans are closer to stereotypes.  On the other hand, I found the inner lives of the and the aliens moving.<br /><br />And, one last book on my march: I went back to [[ASIN:1451678185 The Illustrated Man]] because my niece was reading it in school and I wanted to be the cool uncle. I probably would have enjoyed high school a lot more if they had assigned that to me.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|app does NOT work on Kindle Fire HD  how many words does it take to say something does not work?
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Many elements of the pattern are woven together in this masterpiece. A satisfying synthesis and continuation of the authors vision.  Epic battles, strong characters and building tension and pace until the end.  Great job!
0060763280|5.0|I liked it well enough to give a copy to a daughter and to a friend of mine in Florida.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|the acting was good the actors believable and the scenery cool.. bonies are totally awesome.. word.. word.. word...word. word.word..<br /><br />the acting was good the actors believable and the scenery cool.. bonies are totally awesome.. word.. word.. word...wotd. word.word..
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The original cord had disintegrated.  I was in fear of using the sparkly wire to charge the kindle.<br /><br />One new cord and the kindle came back to life.
B00BXUG0KU|4.0|As others have noted, this is a very fine album and one of which Chet Baker would I'm sureapprove, not least because of Randy Brecker's beautifully crafted solos. Ms Elias's vocals, playing and arrangements are all delightful. Indeed  it's interesting to detect a tip of the hat to George Shearing in some of her arrangements. If I have a criticism, it is that Steve Cardenas should have been given more solo space (rather in the way that Diana Krall gives Anthony Wilson a lot of room to show off his soloing ability).
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game! We were hooked from the start. Perhaps it was a bit too short, but that certainly did not detract from the experience. Very challenging and satisfying for the puzzler in us. Hopefully another challenging Room awaits down the road!
B000BAQ8A0|3.0|I am very distracted by the modern set.  Give me the old fashion staging any day.  Probably would have been nice to watch in person, but on DVD....I think it is just ...OK.....
B000002LR6|5.0|I bought this album upon the recommendation of a friend. I was not a fan of Ministry, but am being converted rapidly to one. This is the first album of theirs I purchased, and will be purchasing more in the future.<br /><br />I bought the album so I could have it &#34;autoripped&#34; to my amazon cloud, and that took approximately 72 hours, which was irritating, but not a big deal.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a great book, and not one I would have immediately recommended to children simply because it is quite violent and very sad. Perhaps for older middle schoolers and highschoolers. I think what makes it so good is that is presents the horror of the Holocaust and WWII from multiple points of view, illustrating that both Germans and Jews suffered at the hands of the Nazis.
B006TZBGBW|5.0|Every CD sounds phenominal! I would have liked to have a list of lyrics and a more detailed summary of each album with liner notes.
B008D36INE|2.0|Couldn't understand any of the character's reasons for their actions.  Very disjointed. One minute she's trying to commit suicide and the next she's out partying.  Very confusing. Waste of time.
B008S80OU2|4.0|Great sound!!! However, the packaging leaves more to be desired. I would have like to have gotten a book with lyrics and liner notes. The font on each cd cover is too small. Other than that, the sound is great.
030758836X|2.0|I need a palate cleanser after reading this book because it leaves a bad taste.  It's nasty.  And depressing because there isn't one admirable main character, and the minor ones are described as either stupid or ugly.  The author must know every mean thing that can be said about another human being.  I haven't read this author before and I won't again.  The only redeeming feature is suspense and in the end that isn't credible.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Sassy, funny, loaded with ethical and moral comment. Loved it. Annoyed that I wasn't paying attention when it was canceled.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I'd heard rumours as to how closely THIS story came to the real event.  It wasn't how I thought the story was going to unfold, but it held that certain determination I think we all were feeling since 9-11 to capture (and kill) BL.  When the film transitions to the actual mission, it gets really intense, and you feel you're right there, holding your breath, rooting on the team that eventually storms BL's compound.  Great Flick.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Could have been alot more action scenes but overall it had a great plot and how it all tied in the characters.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, the best Star Trek move I have Watched. All the Cast is great and story and Special Effects. Can't Wait to see the second one.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I jumped when I first saw the ghost and how and why the girls where part of the story involving the ghost.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Friendly mode is gone. Had to reset graphics but some things are still wacky. Some new vague options. What's going on? How do I get the classic game back??
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|Most entertaining throughout the movie. Interesting ending. Would recommend it to others for the entertainment factor and the story line.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|If you eat, you must watch this movie. It really helps us to think about how we relate to our food and shows so much that we don't know about how our food is made today. It tries to be balanced, even though it has a slant. But it doesn't matter because the information is so important. The section about Stoneyfield is really good, and it ends on a positive note.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is one of the better old Sci Fis. Surprisingly good special effects for its age, and then there is Robbie the Robot's first appearance - premodified of course. I can see the ideas for Star Trek now and then.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Tis is so awesome with such a great cast- Steve Carrell is totally great, Emma Stone lovely and endearing, Julian Moore, and Ryan Gosling make it even better. The story is so true and beautiful, it alsmot makes you believe in soul mates, and I am 43. Just wonderful
0452289963|4.0|A very popular book.  My spirituality class chose this book to read and discuss.  It's a good book on Tolle's teachings, but I found him to be a little repetitious.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|.Good character development.  The story was engaging.  The majority of our book club liked the book.<br />I would recommend it to others.
B00CTEMQLG|5.0|When I first saw previews for this show I thought it was not going to be good.  I am sooo happy I decided to watch it.  I love it!  Its one of the best shows I have seen in a long time.  Everything about this show is amazing, the music, the story line, the acting!  I am heartbroken that NBC drop the show.
B004XISI4A|5.0|If you ever wanted to know what happened to Tyrion et al this book will satisfy your curiosity. Well written, good stories and a few twists to make it more interesting
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|If you enjoy books with no plot and where even the sex scenes are boring, then go ahead and spend the $10.  If you were looking to see about Eva and Gideon and what happens to their story, than you might want to wait until the author decides it will end, could be 2 or more books from now.  I've never returned a book.  I felt if the author didn't wait until the last page to let me know about her plans to change the so called trilogy to become 2 more books, I would have sucked it up to it just being a bad book.
1560100842|5.0|This book contains most of the content from the two animation books that Preston Blair wrote. These are the basics that must be learned by anyone wanting to make hand-drawn animation.
B000FBFML6|5.0|At this point, I realize I should have just bought the entire series in on purchase so I didn't have to wait to start the next book.  Get every book set in this universe!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Oh My God !!! Pinocchio is probably the best hand-drawn Disney feature animation film ever made. It is my favorite one. While there are no Disney Princesses in this one, The Blue Fairy is certainly appealing, and she helps Pinocchio become a real boy.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|Somehow I didn't realize that this series existed as a continuation of Fitz's adventures- what a great surprise! If you enjoy fantasy with characters you grow to love, characters that grow and learn and if you are pretty keen on dogs, you should probably pick this book up!
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Disney did not allocate a huge budget to the making of Dumbo, but in the end, it turned out better than some of the films that had larger budgets. This is an amazing animation story, told in a tender and loving way.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game!<br />This game is very enjoyable. Great way to pass some time. Probably the best app they've done in awhile.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|This movie is adapted from the novel of the same title by Pittacus Lore.  I have read the book and watched the film and it was very well done!  The characters are very well portrayed and the acting and special effects are great.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't make the special financial number to continue the series.  It you like Hunger Games/Twilight movies you should try this one because it is in the same genre!
B005LAIIJY|4.0|The move was no surprise since it was a Tarantino movie. the actors were all good. so, it made for a good movie. Might be offensive to some. But lets face that was party of our history. (nothing to be proud of)
B004NS710C|5.0|A great non-stop action film with great scenery and acting!  I am a little biased since this was filmed in my backyard in Pennsylvania but if you love train movies with action and a good story, you won't be disappointed!
B005S9ELVC|4.0|I like the gangster movies (public enemy, bonnie & clyde,dillinger etc). so this one was just another good gangster movie for me.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Best musical in a long time. Not just another teen bopp high school musical .Totally can relate to Fat Amy!!!!
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|I did like it. But, you had to stay focus or got lost as to what was going on since you were going from past to future back and forth.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|One of the best fun action movies yet!  3rd time seeing it and I'm sure I will see it again in the future!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I like the games I was able to play.  I didn't think it was fair not to be able to play the other games without going on Facebook.<br />I don't do Facebook and I should not be discriminated against.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Completely different than anything ever heard from QOTSA.  Poignant yet characterized by their usual reckless abandon.  About time, but worth the wait.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was hooked on Downton Abbey from the first episode. This series has such rich characters and storyline. It is also a refreshing change to watch a program where the focus is not on pushing the broadcast boundaries of viewer sensitivity. I am so over the police and forensic shows that revolve around the same themes.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am on the 2nd half of this book and dreading the end coming because there is no 4th book yet.  NEED THE 4TH BOOK!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I adore this series once you start with tbis book you wont put it down till you read all three. I highly recommend this one!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series has a good story to it verses 50 Shades of Gray.  Loved it and need the 4th book!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Well I was worried about this book because I have felt that the story had been going down in the last couple books. I think Charmaine Harris just didn't know where to go with 12 books or maybe she just wanted to be done. She wrapped everything up all nice and neat.
B00846REIS|5.0|Want book 4 to come out ASAP!  Better then 50 Shades of Gray!  She can't come out with the 4th book fast enough.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Think this app very useful and its free. Thank you.<br />It also has the useful guide to how much time you have left for different browsing/ games/ WiFi Tec
B007N8RULO|3.0|Although most ads can be skipped/dismissed&hellip;, the video ads take way to long to load &amp; most can not be skipped. If you csn past that the actual game is great.
B001E454NY|5.0|This is better than the Kierra Knightly version, though I loved that, too. This version is much closer to the book than other film versions. I fell in love with Colin Firth the first time I saw this and fall in love with him again every single time I see it. He can tell a story with just his facial expressions!<br /><br />It is broken up into one hour sections, so you don't have to watch it all at once, though the first time or two you will want to. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is an excellent meditation/white noise app. I use it daily and enjoy the variety it provides. I highly recommend this.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Definitely not as good as the others-end isn't what I expected<br />For being the last book in the series-she didn't put much effort
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this show. Ive been watching nonstop in my free time since i started watching 2 weeks ago. The cast of this show is amazing.
B0086700CM|1.0|I don't think this game is fun because all you do is turn turn turn and turn again also collect coins and win them you don't want it trust me I rather get monetary and tekkit
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|While Sanderson breathed life into a series that grew stale with the last few installments by Jordan himself, this book was a disappointment at best. While the previous books Sanderson wrote felt new and exciting with the story being brisk and fulfilling this one felt more like a check list he was going down. The rapid changing of POV's within the chapters also felt sloppy, if not lazy. Also would have liked more closure at the end. Very long way to come to leave long time fans wanting for so much.
B00AFOS9I6|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann is the star of this show!! I think Wagner would be very pleased by Act 1. The rest of the cast is great also.<br />But you can't beat Jimmy Levine and the Met orchestra.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie was applauded at the Oscars which often doesn't mean I will enjoy it.  This time I agreed with them. Daniel Day Lewis was superb as was the entire cast.  This movie captured the war time agony this country was going through perfectly.  It is an emotional journey into one of the most important events in our history. Watch it, remember it because we are still fighting the same struggle.
B00008ENTJ|5.0|This is a classic album by a English rock band, that everyone should have! I will say it is my favorite album of all time! it was Super Tramps 6th album, it has many super hits that people may not know the name but know the tune. The original recording was in 1978 and had many re-releases. I like this album so much i have an original 1979 vinyl,I have it on CD, MP3 and the re-release vinyl. It is nice that amazon also offer Rip it. such a good deal with a awesome album. Only issue was  the viynl had mold release  from making it, washed right off.<br /><br />1.

B005FVNIW6|5.0|Loved it, interesting, riveting, great story. Could not put it down, where is the follow up? Please point me in the right direction!
B002M87V0A|4.0|Great performances by all in a classic presentation of a great musical score.  Robert Preston really worked did a great job as well as Carolyn Jones.
B0081336FO|5.0|This series is still just amazing.  Probably one of the best shows out there, even though there's only 3 episodes per season (at an hour & a half long, that's ok).  Very worthwhile, and I can't wait for S3.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just like everyone else, I was super excited to get my hands on this book! I woke up to people posting on Facebook that it was getting bad reviews before I even had a chance to buy it for myself. I read some of those bad reviews and I was confused. Sylvia posted on her FB and I believe on Twitter that this wasn't the last book a long time ago. Just recently I saw the announcement that there would be five books. I am confused why people are in such an uproar over this. We get more Gideon people! If Sylvia would have made this the last book, it would of been rushed and people would of complained still.<br /><br />I do have to say that I am pissed that the price is more than the paperback. Something needs to change on that standpoint but that is no reason to bash and author or her book!<br /><br />I personally loved Entwined with You, just like the others and I can't wait for books 4 & 5! Please don't make them so expensive! $50 for a e-series is a little much when you can buy the paperback for less.
B00499NHLC|5.0|These episodes play more like movies. The production quality is like nothing else, the cinematography is excellent, but the story & characters are amazing.  I'm completely amazed by this series, it's very good.
B0000A118M|5.0|The sound from the John Coltrane DVD is magnificant; the great price for the DVD is even greater. I will pass this on to friends.
1742200508|5.0|I used this guide on a recent trip to England and found good recommendations on transportation, accommodation, and eating establishments. A good value.
B004XWLN20|5.0|In my opinion, Smallville is the best Superman series.  The characters played their parts well.  Many shows have at least one annoying character but not Smallville.  It did not push a political agenda or sexual preference.  It did not make an episode that discounts religion.  It was a great break from all the cop and lawyer dramas and silly sitcoms.  We need another show on TV like this one.  It was fun and entertainment.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I'm a long time fan of the Jack Reacher Novels. I really love the character.<br /><br /> Only diversion from the novel was the ending...I liked the Novel's ending better.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game cracks me up and I am always making people wonder what I am doing that is making me giggle constantly.  This game definitely tests your patience and makes you think.  I recommend this to everyone.
145210655X|5.0|These are one-page cartoon scenes which I found very cleverly done.  The concept is great and they pull it off well.  I bought it for my 6 year old grandson.  He looks through it all the time.  A good purchase.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|This program has been very helpful in determining whither or not to do a certain activities and to determine how many pages I can read before the Kindle dies.
B0002B15XI|3.0|M*A*S*H is one of those films that everyone says is a classic, but when was the last time you actually sat down and watched it ?  You might be surprised by what you see.  The film was set in Korea- and credit goes to the set designers for the look of muddy squalor- but the attitude is all post-Vietnam.  No authority is respected, and the military is portrayed as an institution totally without merit.  The doctors sport Fu Manchus and shaggy hairdos more appropriate for 1972 than 1952.  When \\"Hot Lips\\" Houlihan shows up and proves to be a stickler for regulations, she is quickly and viciously humiliated sexually.  Drs. Pierce and McIntyre seem more like drunken clods than fun-loving scalpel jockeys.  Director Altman deserves credit for his technique of multiple characters speaking at once, which is more like normal human interaction.  But watching it in 2013, there's a meanness throughout the film that's corrosive and off-putting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is an easy and simple calculator to use on the Kindle.  I personally prefer to use my scientific calculator but hey!, it's free.
1781162646|4.0|Joyland would make a terrific little movie- it's got interesting characters, a little romance, a spooky mystery, and a sense of wistfulness to it.  It's no great classic, but not everything has to be.  Throw it in your beach bag this summer- you'll be glad you did.  For readers who normally shy away from Stephen King's work because of the gore, don't be afraid, there's not much of that here.  Terrific cover art as well, courtesy of Hard Case Crime.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|What a complete let down. Don't bother reading this book. Its nothing like the first two and if you do read it, you just end up hating the characters. The book finished abruptly as though she forgot to complete the book. It seemed like she was struggling to look for a story line, wasting time on characters that didn't even matter. I'm done with Sylvia Day.
160774273X|5.0|Graet product, prompt delivery. Flour Water Salt Yeast: The Fundamentals of Artisan Bread and Pizza is a very well put together book. It has an interesting story and lots of great information and recipes for baking bread. I would definitely recomend it!
0374533555|5.0|The information is enlightening!  I have used the quips in presentations to engage my audience.  Several guests have said they will also purchase the book.
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci's style is extremely good. I have a hard time putting down his books. I wait eagerly for his next book!
B0000065M3|2.0|I ordered this as a used VHS tape.  The tape was obviously used to tape NBA basketball games and also television commercials.  I am very disappointed that the vendor would pawn off a product that he or she partially taped over.  This was not only a used tape but also an abused tape...possibly a copy, difficult to say for sure.  My only regret is that I did not report this vendor to Amazon.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|His books are so well thought out. You never know quite where he will go with his plot. He keeps you in suspense till the end. Can't wait for his next book!
B00CATSONE|5.0|When I find myself saying \\" wow I did not know that \\" I consider reading  a book worth my time.  Thank you for giving it free, I certainly become your reader, well done.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|My boys like filming themselves doing Lego games and battles. This camera let's them do that and they love watching the playback.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Michael covers all the bases in this book from nutrition to correct form for lifts.  It is very informative, well written and thorough.  I would recommend this book. I am excited to get started on this program.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves this game - it really keeps her attention and she enjoys playing it on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|You must own this movie is you meet these requirements.<br />1. You have had a drum solo in your car to rock n roll once in your life.<br />2. You have put on a concert for your cats and or dogs in your house. Air guitar optional.<br />3. You agree with Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.<br />4. Dave Grohl has made you laugh once in your life.<br />5. You owned a pair of Doc Martens and/or flannel shirt in the 90's.<br />6. Because you love to ROCK.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|Not sure how well this ap is working.  It states each time that Im being protected but have no proof of that statement.  Is a bit annoying that it pops up every time something downloads to my android device.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Good book. It was a little slow at times but to be expected. Brought Link more into the story. It's a story about what you'd do for love and the meaning behind friendship and family.
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|Love how Blu-ray brings out the vibrant colors! A good classic for everyone. Get it before it goes back in the vault!
B000003TAR|5.0|The last album produced by Nirvana, but simply a fun interesting album, that gets behind Kurt's feelings towards himself and perhaps society. Its a groovy album indeed, I liked the artwork as well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The third season of Walking Dead is loaded with clever plot twists, inventive storylines, and colorful characters. It is the most imaginative and daring of the three seasons thus far. The show has the best characters behaving in realistic fashion. This is how peoplel would react if such a situation existed. Rick's mania after his loss is scary and tense and it creates ever more drama than the mission they are on at the Governor's compound. I had to keep purchasing the next episode because like the best novels, it keeps you coming back for more.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is probably the greatest albums Nirvana has produced. Full of wonderful grunge songs, although some of the vocals and recordings for the drums are a bit dicey. There are indeed a few good songs, personally I liked them all. If you are interested in Nirvana, this would be the album to buy.
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|This is a review of the vinyl edition.<br /><br />First of all, the music itself. It's way better than I expected. First of all, Ozzy usually sounds auto-tuned on his recent solo work, but not here. Given that his aged voice isn't helped by computers, it sounds pretty good, but not as good as in his youth. It's even more surprising given that he recently lapsed back into drugs and alcohol. Tony Iommi's guitar work is impeccable and the riffs are just as heavy and dark as they were on [[ASIN:B0023P7ZF8 The Devil You Know [Vinyl]]] , which again, is a relief given his recent medical issues. I also was iffy about the replacement drummer Brad Wilk, but he does a great job. In other words, all my concerns about this album were met with a sigh of relief. This album rocks, plain and simple. If you enjoyed the original Sabbath albums, you'll totally love this. If you liked The Devil You Know, you'll love this. The album itself gets a 4/5.<br />T<br />The vinyl on my copy is dead quiet. Absolutely no surface noise, not even between songs. It sounds fantastic. The vinyl is 180 grams and heavy, and feels very resistant to warping. It also comes with a coupon code for a Mp3 version of the album at 320 KBPs.<br /><br />The mastering job is better than the digital version (presumably the master used for the Mp3s was the same as the CD master) as well. It is loud and doesn't have a lot of dynamic range, but at least it isn't clipped to death like the digital version. Here is a comparison (it's also in the customer images gallery if Amazon removes the link). http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61n0%2BgpdVAL.png  My turntable is an Audio Technica LP120, for the curious. If you have the ability to create a digital version of your own from the vinyl, it would be better than the Mp3s you get with it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the vinyl edition didn't have the bonus tracks. The 8 songs are spread over 2 LPs. There would CERTAINLY have been room for the bonus tracks across the 2 LPs considering that the whole album could have fit on one LP to begin with (but being spread out like that improves the audio quality).<br /><br />Overall, I give the vinyl edition a 5/5 because of how wonderfully quiet the vinyl is and the slightly superior mastering job on the vinyl.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game it's sooooooo additive!! I love mixing the dragon's to make different ones!! Wish there was an easier way to make gold but still an awesome game =)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I teach middle grades.  Every student has loved it.  My principal said, and I quote, that this book &#34;changed her life&#34;.  It is a must-read.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best!!! I play it all the time with my little brother i highly recommend this game it may be a little costy but it is worth it
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love this game.  Very entertaining and addictive.  It really gets those brain waves going.  It works very well on my kindle fire HD, and it was free.  There is an option to buy helpful hints, but that's not really necessary.  There are plenty of levels to keep you occupied for a long time.  This game is well worth the download.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is amazing it's fun and cool I wish you could get gems): but  other  than that it's great
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I read this book within two days!!!! Awesome! This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well written with a depth to the characters that draws you into the reality of their experience,<br /><br />The strong desire to survive under circumstances that appear insurmountable gives hope to anyone who may be struggling in their world.<br /><br />Descriptive and captivating
B00364K6YW|5.0|While I like many aspects of other versions, Colin Firth is a fabulous Mr. Darcy, and the actor who plays Mr. Bennet does a wonderful job.  The women are very good as well, especially Caroline Bingley who is as awful as she is supposed to be.  The actress playing Lydia is a bit annoying, but probably a lot like the actual character.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Loved this show. I was sorry to see it end, but it was by far the best ending to a series I have ever seen. A must watch!!!!
B00263HWM8|4.0|great movie! fast action packed, great locales and scenery. tom cruise does a fantastic job on the acting as usual!
B009NY43NY|3.0|This series has had some great and some not so great stories, but I always looked forward to reading the next episode in Sookie's life. So much so, that I would preorder practically every title. This last book tied up all of the loose ends but those knots were shoddily tied--from Eric's departure, to Quinn's convenient reappearance and explanation of how happy his life was now. And to end it the way it did, it just all seems like Harris phoned in the whole story. Sad, really, because it could have been such a better ending.

B00005N6KG|3.0|Sport headphones that will actually stay on your head while you run or work around the yard are getting hard to find. I have yet to find a pair of earbuds that stay in my ears when I am wearing sun glasses so I prefer this type of headphone. I only listen to podcasts so I can't rate their musicality. The good thing about these are they are light and adjustable and stay on my head, especially if I wear a headband over them. Their only downside is the weak link at the connection points. Sooner or later one side always fails and I usually go through 3-4 pairs/year.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The book covers five stories which are loosely connected but the stories told in parts. Parts 1,2,3,4,5 then 4,3,2,1.  Each individual story is interesting. All told in the first person but the language used and settings are so different that they do require a little work to get through.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|So far it's delivered as promised. I was having battery issues and now I can easily monitor my usage and avoid running too low.  And it was free!

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|For me, it all started at a record store in 1970 where I heard 'Paranoid' blasting over the store speakers. At 13 years of age, it made quite the impression. That's what started \\"the obsession\\". Like sitting in English class not hearing a word the teacher said because I had just read an article about the forthcoming \\"Volume 4\\" in Circus magazine. So here we are in 2013, and after false starts, bad blood, and lawsuits galore, three-quarters of My Favorite Band Of All Time deliver a comeback album. I feared many things: 1) the loss of Bill Ward - well, he's not there, and it sucks, plain and simple. But I've dealt with many a band line-up change over the years, and it always comes down to one thing: HOW'S IT SOUND?? In this case, an admirable job by Brad Wilks. Enough of a 70's vibe throughout to remind you of Sabbath past, but a lot of muscle where needed to drive these surprisingly heavy and adventurous riffs and arrangements. Ozzy may be right: Ward may not have been able to handle this album properly in his current state of health. 2) Tony Iommi's cancer - would it negatively impact his playing and compositional abilities? What a relief to hear NO!! The Master is forceful, adept and monstrous on this album, churning out 70 minutes of classic Black Sabbath heavy riffs along with some burning solo work. 3) Rubin's production - whatever criticisms people may have here (I basically have none) he can be thanked for bringing the band back to their roots. Do I wish it was an album full of 'The Wizard' and 'Into the Void'? Yes. Do I wish the old Rodger Bain sound of \\"Master of Reality\\" was resurrected here? Hell, yeah! But no complaints for an album full of songs that could basically have found their way on to any album in the \\"Volume 4\\" - \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" - \\"Sabotage\\" trifecta. And there are moments of earlier influence: 'Damaged Soul' is like Cream on steroids, and could easily have found its way on to Black Sabbath \\"1\\". And 'Zeigeist' is a nice reprieve from all the volume with it's nod to 'Planet Caravan' or 'Solitude'. 4) Ozzy's vocals - OK, we all know how he can sound in concert. Like many aging musicians, his voice is pretty spent, and now resides in a generally lower register. But here, he simply reminds me of why Tony's riffs and Ozzy's vocals have always been like Sean Connery and James Bond, or William Shatner and Star Trek: IT WORKS, plain and simple. Ozzy's voice here is surprisingly effective, lending many of the songs an almost spooky, gothic quality, reminiscent of the way he sang on the first two albums. 5) Anyone criticizing this Return Of The Great Ones need only listen to \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" and \\"Never Say Die\\" to remind themselves where these guys were thirty years ago and where they are now. 6) This, thankfully, sounds NOTHING like the Dio era! Oh, yes, this all could have turned out SO BAD, but it turned out SO GREAT! Thanks, guys, for making me feel 15 again!
B0081BU42O|4.0|Man, is this guy smart. his ability to create new concepts and words is amazing. I would occasionally get a little lost in what he was trying to describe that had no earthly comparison, but the story moved things sufficiently that i just went with the flow.
B00005PJ6M|2.0|I admit I grew up in the 80's. At the end of the 80's and early 90's the movie studios saw a necessity to finance youth-oriented music comedy movies that totally fit in that period like \\"Young Einstein\\", \\"Encino Man\\" and later \\"Wayne's World\\" and \\"Airheads\\". With no exception the two Bill and Ted movies. Back then, when we were kids, the music was right, the childish and naive sketches and the dialogues rocked and the special effects were, well ok for that time.<br /><br />So far so good. But then later on when you grow up, get older, you get a feeling of nostalgia and you can't resist watching the movie again, trying to feel young again. But instead of re-living your past, you simpy feel embarassed having loved the movie so much. You simpy outgrow it because those movies were never meant to be timeless, in fact, they are stuck in time. Stuck in the late 80's and early 90's. Nothing in the movies was designed to live beyond it and make it into the 21st century (like for instance the Indiana Jones franchise or Star Wars or other really timeless classics). So I turned it off half-way because it was simply getting to silly to watch. To stupid to watch. Corny and cheesy with poor acting skills. Maybe that's why it has it's charmes. But not for me anymore.<br /><br />This is my very own and personal review in retrospect. Please don't take it in consideration when you want to rent or buy this movie.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|These acoustic versions show off Joe's vocal ability. This version of Dislocated Boy is my new favorite tune, as the vocals and the bongo drums really make it great.
B004GBFF5Y|4.0|Enough of an Adult movie to interest your young teen, safe enough to not venture into worrisome subjects, but real enough to engender a lot of thought and discussion. A great movie to watch with your 14 year old.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Not Balducci'a best by a long shot. Interesting story and kind of boilerplate, I thought. However I did finish it and I do not finish books that are bad writing, boring story, and so forth
B00CISC2DA|4.0|\\"Perhaps the only album in three years (since 2010's Gorillaz Plastic Beach) that I waited and anticipated for to buy at first release and on hard copy. Scottish electronic music duo bring back their experimental and moody flair with Tomorrow's Harvest, a collection of 17 pieces complementing much of their nostalgic, analogue-sounding cues with more high-definition sound and menace.<br /><br />The album takes much more a Geogaddi direction in its sound design and mood than Campfire Headphase (which is phenomenal in case the haters deny) and Music Has the Right... At first a hard one to try and grasp as the album acted a bit sluggish and compromising at the beginning, the second try at listening to it was a bit more rewarding which is why I did not automatically give it a 5-star review. Issues of immediacy and variety did arise in the beginning as I heard this album. The beginning with the recently known and very sci-fi-like Reach for the Dead did not kick-start with much surprise or intrigue as An Eagle in Your Mind or Chromakey Dreamcoat (the first ever BoC song I ever heard, in truth).<br /><br />As I got grasp of much of their signature elements and the funky-psychedelic rhythms, then I started developing my already obsessive interest of the album. Within respected order, Jacquard Causeway (while repetitive, it was still spectacular with much of its Burial-esque drumming pattern), Telepath (clearly BoC from the haunting voice sample and editing), Palace Posy (which sounds like slow-tuned jungle meets French electronica act Deep Forest), Nothing is Real (cheerful, beautifully done, and romantic in a kind of way), New Seeds (calculating and a bit like the Tortoise song, Djed), and the difficult-to-pronounce Semena Merlvykh (a foreboding, extremely well-done orchestral type of piece that could have fitted the Prometheus soundtrack any day and made it more appreciable to its already displeased fans). The artwork is also complementary with some abstract and naturalistic designs of Californian desert, military buildings, and grainy shots of outer San Francisco which are well-done in its 8mm like film but kind of contradictory to their image as either Canadians or Scottish.<br /><br />The unpredictability and nature vibe is what them interesting in the first place. I got this album for that reason just mentioned and because I am a rather big fan of their work. Thankfully, much of it did not disappoint and they stayed to their guts unlike the increasingly-pop Royksopp and Hot Chip, or the same old, same old Autechre. Thankfully, BoC reign high and strong with their strange melodic standards compared to other musicians who have had long waits from its respected fans like My Bloody Valentine, Daft Punk, and David Bowie.\\"ic designs of Californian desert, military buildings, and grainy shots of outer San Francisco which are well-done in its 8mm like film but kind of contradictory to their image as either Canadians or Scottish.<br /><br />The unpredictability and nature vibe is what them interesting in the first place.

B00AQMSJI2|3.0|Playmobil Pirates is a pretty good game, however, the further you get in the game the more doubloons and gems you need to purchase things.  Starts getting pretty boring and tedious after a while of not being able to progress.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|These sticks worked perfectly in my Synology 1512+.  They were exactly as the website stated and have not had any problems with them yet.

B0073J6654|5.0|A lovely visual version of Ms. Carriger's brilliant novel series!  Highly recommended for fans of steam punk and occult fantasy.  Some mature content is included.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|When I went to see this movie in theaters, I was frankly not looking forward to it. It had the faint odor of Glee, which is a show I find rather blah. This movie is smart, witty, irreverent, and just hilarious. Rebel Wilson is brilliant, and Anna Kendrick is spot on. If you're in to unconventional comedies like Drop Dead Gorgeous or Best in Show, this flick is right up your ally.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book was a real eye-opener. It made me see things in a new light. Highly recommend this book to anyone wanting change.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This was... 40 minutes too long. Laziest writing I've experienced in years. Please, Judd Apatow, stop exposing the world to your pointless, vulgar immaturity.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Excellent family movie. No crude humor, offensive jokes, or other garbage people tend to put I'm these movies. It is highly entertaining, beautiful visuals, and if you have 7.1 sound it makes good use of all the speakers. I highly recommend this movie even if you aren't watching with kids!

B007TNS6JI|3.0|its okay, but it gets really repetitive really quick. what I don't like about most games like this is you cant go anywhere in the game without buying their packages
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I love the frames so this was a no brainer once I saw a clip of the movie. Gives me goosebumps or goose pimples as they say on that side of the pond. GREAT soundtrack. Real music.

B002UBRFDC|4.0|I enjoyed the book, especially the intro to Eastern culture and the commentary on how filthy we Westerners typically were, and still are to a large degree. My only gripe is that it sucks that the Kindle ebook is not available for lending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game feels almost like real life. You can have as many horses as you choose as long as you can pay for them. You can groom feed treat and partake in training plus competitions with your horse. You can also partake in goals that your trainers give you. You can clean the pasture and muck out the stalls. I love getting to me new people online.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is perfect for me, for when my computer decides to not work i can just use my kindle to listen to my favorite radio station from my hometown. the only reason I'm not giving it all stars is that playback after recording doesn't work as well as i had hoped. When i listen to it, while recording, its smooth no skips or 'static' like sounds. when i play it back there's static, its skips, its nothing of what i was just listening too. disappointing because i like the fact that i can record it and go back and listen to it again.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put this down once I started reading this morning. Mira had me hooked with the story line from the beginning. Knew Megan & Connor would stay together but with each new fact about their background I thought maybe I was wrong. Short, fast read and entertaining to the end. Would have liked an epilogue to finalize the storyline. Will look for more books by Mira Kelly and will recommend this to friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this item is very Good I have a black one and paid the same price but it didn't come with a sheath so I was a little disappointed. Very good with assist opening like it better becuz its blue.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|Don't try it if your heart cannot hold the tension. I have finished the Original on the first day (thus the Original is more family fun,in my opinion) but failed to go through this one. It has 125 stops and features four starting points (1, 33, 56, 91) so you can practice different routes.
0425263991|3.0|To be honest, I would have to say I am disappointed with this book.  YES!!!  I have read the entire series. For me the hype was too much, so my expectations were high...but I was lead there....the piece meal info we were all fed, not knowing and having to guess who the book was about...all too much.  It was an ok read...probably not one I will pick up and re-read when I want a good read...like I would Hawke and Sienna's book.  On the other hand maybe I will just to see what the  144 5-stars are all about.  Not the best of series for me :(

B0091REZMW|5.0|Ilike the kind of games where you search for things. It is fun and i look forward to playing it more.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This type of music won't appeal to everyone.  Six of the songs are short as in like under 2 minutes. 10 are in the 2 minute range and the rest are over. Most are instrumental. I can't say exactly which is my favorite song because I have only played them twice so far.  As a whole group the songs are nice not overpowering.  Nice beat to a few too. For some humor if you have kids and they do homework, then turn the TV off and put these songs on.  These songs can mellow you out, and helps you to get paperwork done.  I got done  around the mid point of the album.  Most days it takes me a hour or more.  Will do this again.
B008476HBM|5.0|We have had Pride and Prejudice in the canon of English literature since 1813, and now 200 years later, Amazon wants a review of it. I suppose that by modern standards, the novel could be said to be too wordy and tells more than it shows, but that would be as ridiculous as trying to find things 'wrong' with this classic.
1781162646|4.0|Joyland is not a horror novel. It's not really a ghost story. It has a ghost story in it, and that's about it. And the horror is all in the humanity.<br /><br />Joyland is really a novel about a young man, a 21 year old named Devin Jones, who has taken up a job at Joyland, an amusement park in Heaven's Bay, North Carolina. it is about a boy who's first real love has just left him for another man, leaving Devin (Dev to most, Jonesy to some, Kiddo to others) a virgin; heart broken. He decides to take a semester off of college and stay on at Joyland during the autumn. After he saves a little girl from choking on a hotdog, his boss agrees.<br /><br />There is a ghost (supposedly) haunting the Horror House, a ghost that supposedly roams the tracks of the funhouse ride after her throat was slit and her body was dumped. Devin's friend, Tom, saw the ghost, and Devin and Tom's girlfriend, Erin decide they will investigate the murder.<br /><br />But really, the mystery and horror of Horror House take a back seat to the heart-felt story of Devin's relationship with Annie and Mike Ross. Mike is condemned to a wheelchair and will die soon (he's got Muscular Dystrophy), and his mother knows it. In fact, it's why everyone in town believes her to be a cold-hearted woman. But Devin breaks through to her after he helps her son fly his kite--her son who has a psychic ability.<br /><br />If you are looking for suspense, this may not be the novel for you. If you are looking for horror, go find a copy of IT, or THE SHINING. Joyland is a different novel from King. It is somewhere between 11/22/63 and The Body. A coming of age story that satisfies and has the reader sitting back reminiscing about his/her own early twenties. That is the joy of reading King, and that Joyland certainly delivers a great, dramatic story with just a twinge of mystery and a twist of King's love of the supernatural.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!

B00004Z4SD|5.0|Here's a little known movie that should have been more popular when it first came out. The characters are endearing, the acting good, and the situation both humorous and encouraging.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|After decades of waiting, 3/4's of the original Black Sabbath (including Ozzy) reunite for what has to be one of the most anticipated CD's of the year, the boomtastic \\"13.\\" I can testify that it was worth the wait. Producer Rick Rubin told the band to go back to their early albums to get a feel for what he was expecting to produce, and the band took it to heart. This is metal so dense, it cuts like used crankshaft motor oil. It's that heavy.<br /><br />If you're looking for speedy riff rocking, it's not here. This is the sound that created such anthemic dirges as \\"War Pigs\\" or \\"Sweet Leaf.\\" There's even a touch of Ozzy the blasphemer as he raises the question \\"Is God Dead?\\" And they pound that riff into submission for over 8 minutes. Granted, Ozzy's voice is showing its weathering, but Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler still have the magic spooky touch. (Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk fills in for Bill Ward.) \\"End Of The Beginning\\" snakes a demented blues riff to kick the album off with a oozing pounce. Or there's \\"Dear Father,\\" which tackles the subject of abuse.<br /><br />The band has never been scared of heavier topics, which \\"Dear Father\\" and the anxiety provoking \\"Methademic\\" show. (Given Ozzy's recent trip to rehab, maybe even closer to home than known.) The band even throws a few touchstones from the old days in when \\"Zeitgeist\\" pays homage to \\"Planet Caravan.\\" Even with that obvious reference, \\"13\\" pounds and stomps like the monsters Black Sabbath were at the peak of their powers. The sense of dread and thrill of doom still permeate the best of the songs here, and - despite their age - the band doesn't sound like they are pandering to their past or trying to stay current. \\"13\\" is every bit as tasty as \\"The Devil You Know\\" (by Heaven and Hell with Dio), just down tuned and packed with 50% more evil.<br /><br />Worth the wait and better than anyone could have possibly expected at this point in their collective life, \\"13\\" is a triumphant comeback. \\"I Ain't no hero to come and save you,\\" Ozzy wails in \\"Peace of Mind.\\" Well, actually guys, you are. Thanks for saving heavy metal for 2013.come and save you,\\" Ozzy wails in \\"Peace of Mind.\\" Well, actually guys, you are. Thanks for saving heavy metal for 2013.
