B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have not had the opportunity (yet) to see the play - I will see it this weekend in Boston, but I do have the soundtrack, with Michael Crawford and Sara Brightman, and I will tell you one thing...Emmy Rossum in some scenes IS Sara Brightman. When I first saw the film, I could not control myself from crying.  My heart goes out to the Phantom, and everytime he says \\"Christine\\", my heart just breaks.  The chemistry between Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler sizzles. My favourite scenes are when Christine and the Phantom singing together \\"Past the Point of No Return\\"...God, one could feel the fire between them....and the scene of Christine singing alone \\"Wishing you were somehow here again\\" in the cemetery, sent shivers up my spine and gave me goosebumps.  This man (the phantom) all he wanted was to be with Christine, and yes Christine loved him...my heart breaks when she said to him \\"beautiful creature of darkness, what kind of life have you known. God gave me courage to show you that you are not alone\\" and kisses him.  If this is not love what is?  I highly recommend this film...for I have seen it 10 times, already.  I do own the CD, which I listen to in my office, the car, at home, everywhere...Emmy Rossum is enchanting as Christine, and Gerard Butler is excellent as the Phantom...he made me cry.
0486237664|5.0|Every art teacher I've ever had seems to have had this book, and for good reason!  If you want great realistic black-and-white illustrations of animals to model a picture or sculpture on, this is a wonderful reference.  Each page is full of animals in many different poses and environments, grouped by species and variety.  From birds to horses to fish to insects, this book has a great many excellent illustrations to copy or just look at and admire.  Most are labeled, and are for the most part are very realistic and well-proportioned.  My one annoyance is the title, so bland and forgettable for such a memorable book!  A great book for someone looking for a large collection of animal art.
B000003S5H|5.0|This album is AWESOME! You just must get a copy, you have to experience by yourself, words can't describe the beautiness and quality on each song played, the songs \\"you make it easy\\", \\"all I need\\" are totally beauty with the smooth and sensual voice of Beth Hirsh, there are no complexity on the lyrics, but just hearing her voice makes you traveling among clouds and that'll be enough to fall in love with these songs. The other songs are just an excellent pieces of retro-electro-acoustic music.  <br /> <br />that's why AIR has become one of my favorites electronic downtempo groups, the refreshing music makes me very comfortable, relaxing, getting in good mood wherever i go...at work, traffic jam, at home... <br /> <br />This one is a must for a lover of this kind of electronic genre
B0007OCG4W|2.0|Photography, not the movie itself. The acting was as expected from this cast, but the directing and script smothered the acting to the point where when Alice at the end of the movie said, \\"I don't love you anymore,\\" the group of people I was with and I started cracking up. I seriously wouldn't be surprised if a highschool student wrote the script. It's such a shame, because the acting was superb, and so was the photography, but I just want to hit the writer in the face. The characters, no matter how pristine they're portrayed, are simply just not believable. Most of the chars were over age 30; I don't know a single person who's not hospitalized over 30 that acts as juvenile as they did. <br /> <br /> <br />The only character that I could even live with was Alice, and you can seriously see that at the end of the movie that all the director wanted to do was flatter Natalie. Screw art, film, lets just focus on the actresses's t1ts. Don't believe all these reviews claiming this movie as a \\"self-help\\" book as what not to do in a relationship, because my god if you don't know by default to not do these things maybe it's time to go sit down and take your SATs all over again. No one acts like this and if you're with someone who does, well, heh, child molesting is usually a 25 to life sentence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But the movie made a lot of money, and you can owe it all to the director for putting Natalie Portman in the stripper position, because to make a lot of money obviously all you need to do is take a popular young actress and get her naked.
068987474X|5.0|One night after a \\"oh, he's just so nice and sweet and rich and...\\" date turned out to be a complete jerk, my friend mentioned He's Just Not That Into You, and I was immediately intrigued.  <br />After nursing my wounds with a pint of ice cream and some sappy movies, I eventually made myself leave the house and get this book. It was the best thing I ever could have done. <br />It tackles every thought that goes through a woman's head: the excuses, the denial, and the sorrow that you face at thinking you're NOT someone your \\"dream guy\\" will fall head over heels for. But along with some tough medicine, Behrendt gives pratical advice from a MAN'S point of view. For years girls have been going to womens magazines looking for answers about guys, when really, what is better than a man's actual answers to all these questions? <br />I learned that just because someone is not that into me, it doesn't mean I have to drown myself in triple chocolate ice cream. Instead I should go flaunt what I have and not waste my time with jerks who don't even like me that much anyway, because surely some awesome guy is on his way!
B00065JTBA|1.0|The Charges : 1. Turning heavy metal into wuss music<br />  2. Inciting no talent bands like Nirnana to revolt<br />  againt the aforementioned wuss music<br /><br />The Verdict : GUILTY ON BOTH COUNTS
B00005ASHM|5.0|I personally believe that Pet Sounds can be argued the best album of all time. Yet I'm sure most would disagree. My first reason is that while the Beatles were a great band; they achieved this by total collaboration from the band.Each member adding to the creative flow of writing music.The Beach Boys had  Brian Wilson. 95% of the music produced by the Beach Boy's came from a single source fueling every little bit of the song writing. Not only was there lack of complete collaboration, Brian had resistance from, family, record label, and fellow band members. Brian went against everything that the popular culture wanted; to do another fun campy surf album. Any musician knows that this is extremely difficult to do. So in a sense it was Brian Wilson Vs. The Beatles. Pet Sounds is Brian Wilson's masterpiece. It is music that speaks from the conflicts from within rather than the popular \\"sixties\\" rhetoric of outward conflicts and political/ social themes. If you do the research you will find that true musicians and people whom are musically educated will agree that Pet Sounds is if not the best, is the second best album of our time. Of course there is comparisons to Sargent Pepper and the Beatles, and why not? Compare and contrast is the primary method of good debate.  Throughout music history we have made these comparisons. To suggest that because Brian Wilson ( as well as others),  compare it to a great album ( Sargent Peppers) certainly makes it no less a quality and excellent musical composition. . The Beatles did the same thing. It is well documented fact that the Beatles absolutely were \\" blown away\\" by Pet Sounds and the work of Brian Wilson. Does that make their  albums post Pet Sounds any worse or not as good? Certainly not! I can ramble on forever, but the fact remains and is mostly undisputed , Pet Sounds is considered by most experts, one of the great albums of our time. Anyone who has any sense of true musicianship would buy this album for the sake of  growthin music appreciation. Thank you Brian Wilson!
B000084T18|5.0|When I was looking at the reviews of 50 Cent's debut album(not including Power of The Dollar) I was amazed that the average rating was 3 1/2 stars out of 5 considering it was one of the best debuts since the Slim Shady LP. 50 May not be the best rapper lyricaly, but he's still  better than 90% of the rappers out there because of his superior beats (from Dre and a couple from Em) and hooks(or choruses). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of G Unit you'll see that he's made a lot of hooks for the other members of group, he made most of the hook from \\"On Fire\\" and \\"Smile\\" & \\"I Get High\\" from Lloyd Banks, he also made hooks for The Game like \\"Westside Story\\", \\"How We Do\\", and \\"Hate It Or Love It\\", also when he did his G Unit album he made the hooks for \\"Poppin' Them Thangs\\", \\"Beg For Mercy\\", \\"My Buddy\\" & \\"Stunt 101\\", also he helped Yong Buck with part of \\"Let Me In\\", \\"Bonafide Hustler\\", & \\"I'm a Soldier\\" (By the way all of those albums except for Beg for Mercy are pretty good for fans of G Unit and people who like rap and The Documentary By The Game, is the best). <br />Some of The Best Songs Are: <br />In Da Club 5/5!!!!!!! The Best Song on the Album. Great Beat, lyrics, and one of his finest hooks. <br /> <br />P.I.M.P. 5/5!!!!!!!!!!!! Fabolous song by with a good hook, beat, and great lyrics for 50's standards. <br /> <br />Many Men (Wish Death) 5/5!!!!!!!! Second best song of the album! Good lyrics, fantastic beat that fits the song well, and his best hook ever where he sings a little bit. <br /> <br />21 Questions Featuring Nate Dogg 5/5!!!!!!!! Third best song. 50 Shows his sense of humor with the line \\"I Love You Like, A fat Kid LIke Cake(Classic), Nate Drops a great chorus and there's also a pretty good beat. <br /> <br />Wanksta 5/5!!!!!!! This song orginally came from the 8 Mile album when Eminem couldn't wait to show off 50's talent. A great song with a good beat, good lyrics, and fantastic hook, ounce again. <br /> <br />Back Down 5/5!!!!!!!!! Great song with a good beat, good lyrics, great choruses and ouce again 50 shows his humor off when he creates his own version of one of Em's line from the Eminem Show, \\"I've bean patiently waiting to blow!!! Welcome to the 50 Cent Show.\\" <br /> <br />Patienly Waiting 5/5!!!!! A great song from 50 Cent, with a good chorus, a good beat by Em (one of his best) and he also drops a good verse. <br /> <br />If I Can't 5/5!!!!!! A great song with a good chorus, and the best is after a minute where 50 sings a little bit, he also has one really good part of pimp after a minute and half as well. <br /> <br />HEAT 4 1/2/5! A good song with a nice beat, and a great hook but its annoying at the begginn where 50 pretends to be high(I think). <br /> <br />Poor Lil' Rich 4 1/2/ 5!! A great beat, ok lyrics but his hook and beat makes up for it. <br />Like My Style 4 1/2/5!! This song actually suprised me, i skipped over it 30 times before it started to listen to it because it starts off slow but then the beat gets pretty good, also tony yayo makes a brief cameo (Oh yeah get his album because he really is one of the best in the group). <br /> <br />Gotta Make It To Heaven 4 1/2 / 5 A good song with a great beat, an average hook for 50 but still good for most rappers. <br /> <br />Blood Hound 4 1/2!!!!!! A good song, with a great beat, good hook, and 50 makes a woof sound that sound pretty good, also young buck drops a verse on the track. <br /> <br />So overall a masterpiece from 50 Cent. A handful of 5 star songs and 4 star songs, the only song I don't like is Don't Push Me with Em and Lloyd Banks. If you like this album than i would recommend Em's First 3 albums Eminem Show with lots of great tracks like Without Me, Till I Collaspe with Nate Dogg, Sing For THe Moment, My Dads Gone Crazy, and many other, The Marshall Mathers LP also has the standout tracks Stan, Real Slim Shady, The Way I Am, the most crazy song Em's ever made Kim, and The SLim Shady LP with some of Em's classic story telling like Myname is, Role Model, Guilty Conscience, and I'm Shady, Brain Damage, and copy some of his better songs from Encore (which isn't bad but doesn't live up to his previous albums). <br /> <br />Also Straight Outta Cashville from Young which has some hot tracks like Shorty Wanna Ride, Let Me In, Stomp with Luda and TI or Game depending on the version, Bang Bang, Prices on My Head, Look at Me Now where Kaniver (from D12) drops a fantastic hook. The Documentary By The Game which has the single's Hate It Or Love It(Great Lyrics from Game) & How We Do, where 50 and Game go back and forth and other great songs like Higher Produced By Dre, Westside Story where 50 drops a good hook, Put You On The Game with a good hook from Game, We Ain't with Eminem, No More Fun and Games (which is too short and would be better if it were longer) it was also produced by Just Blaze, The Documentary, Dreams produced by Kanye West & Like Father Like Son where Busta Rhymes drops a suprisingly good hook. Bank's album The Hunger For More is also pretty good, it has some good tracks like Warrior pt 1 & 2, ON FIRE, Karma with a great chorus from Avant, I'm So Fly his best song, Smile (I'm pretty sure), Ain't No Click, Work Magic , Til The End & When The Chips are down with the Game.  <br /> <br />Also Kanye West's album college dropout is a great album as well and is a good or better than the Games Documentary. G Unit, at this rate, is gonna be around for a long time and I'm looking for their albums in the future.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I was never a fan of Green Day until I heard this album. Sure, I heard the obvious tunes on the radio and thought they were okay. Yet, I was always struck by their rather sophomoric sound and antics so I shied away from them not realizing how phenomenally talented they are. American Idiot is awfully clever. Lyrics are scintillating, scathing, rich, humorous and deep, while a mesh of musical styles keeps interest and shows remarkable depth. The best songs are contained in the first 6 tracks of the album. Rather, those are my favorites because of their drive, energy, tongue-in-cheek harmonies (doo-wop anyone?) as well as their raw emotional appeal. Yet, I appreciate the utter poignancy of Wake Me Up When September Ends and the hazy reminiscence of Whatsername. Give Me Novacaine is flat until the utterly surprising guitar riffs at the end. It's so humdrum until that point that when it happens you just have to smile. This album is addictive, and you'll want to listen to it over and over again. I know I did. Now I want to hear more, strange as that may seem coming from someone who wasn't even a fan in the first place; I am won over.
B0002X314C|5.0|Not since The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill has an album this deep come about. I can listen to the entire CD without skipping a single song. My favorite song is 'She Don't Have To Know'. It has a Caribbean vibe to it, and it brings back a lot of memories. Two thumbs way up!!!

6304698623|2.0|This is a lovely movie, with great costumes, lush sets, nice music and a sweet story, but it isn't A Little Princess, by Frances Hodgson Burnett.  If you read the book you would be amazed at how far they strayed.  1.  The story is supposed to take place in England, not New York.  2.  The story is supposed to take place in Victorian times, not during WW1! 3.  The father really dies, he doesn't come back, and he dies from a fever, not on a battlefield.  4.  There is absolutely no locket in the entire book, yet it is one of the biggest storylines in the movie.  5.  The whole idea of the movie is to examine the riches to rags theme, how people treat you, how you behave like a princess no matter what condition you are in, and treat others the same way, and is a sound portrayal of the lowerclass life in Victorian England; cook, skivies, maids of all work, etc.  And the many homeless children on the street.  We don't even get to see Carrisford and his legal advisors searching for Sarah, all over the world, only to find out she is living in the attic one house over.  In other words, you are your neighbour's keeper.  If you want to see an accurate portrayal of this treasured novel, please watch the 1986 BBC production starring Amelia Shankely.  This movie, cute as it is, shouldn't even bear the title.  Oh, and completely forget her walking a plank to get to the neighbour's house.  That doesn't happen in the book, either.  Nor does the reading and stories at night, nor the attempt to get a necklace back, nor the sister escaping with the milkman, nor the spell on Lavinia's hair.  And Lavinia doesn't get Sarah's room, either.  That goes to a new student.  Sheesh.
B0006J28BO|4.0|Rounding out the trio of the second wave of the Studio Ghibli DVDs distributed by Disney is THE CAT RETURNS, a curious entry to the Ghibli library.  The film, directed by newcomer Hiroyuki Morita, is actually a spin-off of another Ghibli production, Yoshifumi Kondo's WHISPER OF THE HEART.  I've practically enjoyed all of the Miyazaki movies I have seen thus far as well as Isao Takahata's GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, for all of these movies are artistically beautiful and not just masterpieces of Japanese animation, but true classics, period.<br /><br />Unfortunately the same cannot be said for THE CAT RETURNS.  The story, which involves a moody high school student whisked away to the Cat Kingdom after she rescues a feline from being run over by a truck, is serviceable but uninspired and predictable in a Disney-ish sort of way--a trait that Miyazaki and Takahata's works never shared, and that is a detriment to this film.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is the \\"believe in yourself\\" message.  Rather than allowing the viewer to watch the struggles of the protagonist and determine what she has to learn in order to return to her homeland, she is given this very message verbally about halfway through the movie.  Not only does this undermine the theme, it makes the ultimate resolution less satisfactory than it should be.<br /><br />THE CAT RETURNS is not a bad film by any means.  It has its preciously delightful moments (an adorable scene where we see a young girl feeding a small, filthy kitten fish crackers and a very charming ballroom dance sequence), a fare share of comedy (mostly in the form of a grouchy fat furball named Muta), and one truly memorable character, a suave, splendidly dressed \\"aristocat\\" antique by the name of Baron (his presence carries the movie as a whole).  But while THE CAT RETURNS is unquestionably fine for children and families, it is ultimately a lesser effort, both narratively and artistically (the artwork, although colorful and imaginative for the most part lacks the polish that we have come to expect from Ghibli), and consequently, is not especially memorable.<br /><br />Still, take my review with a grain of salt and check out THE CAT RETURNS.  Even if it is essentially the weakest of the Studio Ghibli films I have seen thus far, I did enjoy it for what it was, and Ghibli at its least is 205% better than some of the worst animated features out there.<br /><br />While I'm on it, though, I should mention that Disney has done yet another top-notch job in terms of the DVD and dubbing presentation.  The visual transfer is crystal clear and vibrant (no surprise since the film is an all-digital production), and the English voice acting (which this time includes Anne Hathaway, Tim Curry, Peter Boyle, and Elliot Gould) is fabulous as always with special credit to Cary Elwes (Donald Curtis in PORCO ROSSO), who is perfect as the Baron.  The extras are the same as the other Disney/Ghibli DVD releases--voice talent featurettes, trailers, and storyboards... but it DOES contain a half-hour long piece on the making of THE CAT RETURNS.  Strangely, I found this more interesting to watch than the movie itself, especially considering the source of its inspiration (a stray cat).  There is only one catch about the DVD release, though, and that is that the dubtitles provided for the Japanese language track.  Considering that Disney has included literal translations for almost all of its Ghibli releases (KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE was dubtitled, but not the same way that this one is), this is a major disappointment for fans that prefer watching Anime in Japanese.  As mentioned, though, this is the only shortcoming in the package.<br /><br />Although THE CAT RETURNS is not the masterpiece that its Ghibli predecessors are, it is, as mentioned, still enjoyable for kids and families.

0156027321|3.0|I wanted to read a book that would move me and give me a change of pace from the usual horror, fantasy and fiction that I read all the time. This was an odd break from my usual reading genres and I found this book both excruciatingly graphic and moving. I found the first part of the book dull and slowly paced. The only things we learn after 100 or so pages is our main characters name (Pi is his nickname), some scientific zoological facts and some info on different religious beliefs. We get some insight into Pi and the kind of boy he is. He is a practicing Christian, Muslim, Hindu...hmmm, was there any religion Pi didn't practice? The second half of the book was definetly more interesting. I have honestly never read a story that made me cringe and feel sick as much as this book did. I found myself enthralled during the beginning of the second half, as our young hero Pi finds himself clinging to life after the ship his family and the zoo animals they own sinks. Pi finds himself adrift on a lifeboat along with an injured zebra, a maniacal hyena, a seasick female orangutan and an enormous bengal tiger.<br />The story quickly becomes a gory, slaughterfest as the zebra is eaten alive, the orangutan fights to the death, and the tiger makes a meal of, well...everything except PI. I unfortunatly found the animal deaths far too graphic and disgusting for my tastes. I am an avid animal lover, and although I DO understand the whole symbolism and meaning behind there deaths, it was still stomach turning to read scene after scene of animals being killed in terrible ways.<br /> I did find this book meaningful despite those gore filled moments though. It's a story of survival and It does make you realize how lucky we are to be here, and how grateful we should feel each day we get to spend with our families. The ending of the story boils over with a shocking and even more highly disturbing twist that I won't mention, but It left me feeling sick and even more repulsed than when I was reading about the animals dying terribly. I would give the story more stars if it wasn't such a depressing, gory, morbid tale. You finish reading the book and start thinking of how alike we are to animals, and how the author really tied those relations together in such an inredibly shocking way. I did find myself wanting to call someone who had also read the book just to discuss the ending, but I unfortunatly didn't know anyone who had read it! Overall, the story is engrossing and beautifully written. I am only taking 2 stars off because of a slow start and too much gore.g about the animals dying terribly.

B0007P3582|1.0|Now, technically I shouldn't be writing this because I don't like rap in general, but I do listen to it at my friends house all the time whenever I visit him. With his angst attitude towards everything that sounds threatening (ranging from guns to candy) he makes a song about it, and makes the even word repulsive. True story; I was sitting on a bench where I live waiting for someone, and A couple other people came and sat next to me. After a breif moment of silence one of them said something like, \\"I'm hungry, so I'm going to the candy shop across the street\\". His friend started complaining how he should never have said the two words candy and shop together at once in fear that someone might think they were 50 Cent fans. I took it upon myself to assume that they weren't when I first saw them because one of them was wearing a Tool t-shirt, completely different genre at that. <br /> <br />IMPORTANT MESSAGE RIGHT HERE: If you liked the first album more than this one, you want to know why? It's probably because of the beats. Guess who made the beats for this album? 50 Cent. Gues who DIDN'T make them for Get Rich Or Die Trying? 50 Cent. Dr. Dre made them. Dre makes teh beats for all the people who are under his recording house, and when someone breaks out and tries to make their own record, they usually are no good at all. If you want a lyrical genious, I strongly recomend either Ludacris' \\"Back for teh First Time\\" or \\"Word of Mouf\\" albums, or Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic album\\". That and Bone Thugs N' Harmony is good because they actually have tone when they sing/rap which makes it that much more enjoyable. For being a bunch of ex-choir boys, Bone Thugs is great, and I don't even like rap. <br /> <br />But if angry, obnouxious, \\"Woe is me, my life was horrible, feel sorry for me by buying my record and getting me that much more rich than I'll ever need to be\\" music is what you're into, be my guest, buy this trash, but it's just like throwing $14 IN the trash. Like I said, talen in this genre goes to Ludacris, Dr. Dre (the one who started it all) and Bone Thugs. Also, don't say this review wasn't helpful because you're a little 50 Cent wannabe and you'd do anything to make his record look better, even if it includes saying that a review was not helpful because it (get this) made a point.

076783819X|4.0|Arlington Road brings to the screen the story of a University professor (and widower) who spends increasingly more time with his neighbors only to realize that they are not who they seem to be...   The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.  Needless to say, Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  The only setback is in relation to the FBI's failed operation, which is just too far fetched in being such an overwhelming failure.  Aside from that, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!  In short, it is a movie worth watching!

But I must admit it wasn't until recently that I bothered to pick up any of Neil Gaiman's Sandman books. So it must have been fate that I happened to be in Borders one day and the book caught my eye. Having heard about Season of Mists particular storyline I decided to buy it. What immediately followed was the beginning of an automatic obsession with the series, and spending countless sleepless nights reading the story again and again. <br /> <br />In Season of Mists, Morpheus (the Lord of Dreams from the first three Sandman volume's) travels to Hell to save the soul of his past lover. But upon his arrival Morpheus discovers that Lucifer is tired of ruling hell, frees all the demons and souls of the damned, locks up shop, and give's the key to Morpheus. With the key in his posession dozens of other wordly entities arrive in Morpheus' dreamworld to claim the key as their own... <br /> <br />All in all I'd recommend this book (and this entire series) to any comic book reader. It is a definite must have!
6305428042|5.0|I can't describe in words how much this movie means to me, I literally know about all of the words to it! I watch it plenty times a month and it's one of those great movies that never get old. <br />This movie is perfect for the people who are really into Halloween and witches, but not to extremes. This movie shows a great and haunting tale of three witches who have come back from the grave, 300 years after they were hung in Salem. It's a magnificent tale that is entertaining in every single scene it has.  <br />Your Halloween will NOT be complete, I mean your LIFE will not be complete until you watch this masterpiece!!!
0792841344|5.0|<br /> If I could give this movie 10 stars, I would. This is where the Phantasm legacy began 26 years ago, with the Tall man, Reggie the ice cream man, Jody, Mike, Morningside and the flying sphere. I'll never forget the first time I saw this film..It was very original, and nothing like this had ever been created before. While there are classics such as the Friday the 13th series, Halloween and many others, this is a unique and original film that thankfully did not suffer the over exposure and commercialization that many films in this genre have experienced. Phantasm is one of the \\"hidden gems\\" of horror movies. While I have viewed the entire series, this first film is my favorite.
B000089RV6|5.0|this album shows AC/DC at their height. the songs are complex and still rock. if you like rock n roll, or just like AC/DC; this is the album to buy..de facto. there is not one song on here i dont like. every solo on here fits perfectly; brians vocals are high and gritty. the rhythm section..mal phil and cliff are always on point and you can set your watch by phils drumming.  <br /> <br /> <br />whoever said this isn't ac/dc's best album is full of dog poop. even the australian version of dirty deeds isnt close to their best album. highway to hell is close, but this is better :-) <br /> <br />
B000784WMW|5.0|Finally!!  I have been waiting 10+ years for this version to be released in its entirety.  I bought the 2 vhs tape version 5 or so years  ago and I was so disappointed!  Let me tell you why. <br /> <br />Back in the 80's (I think) when I was in highschool, we didn't have cable television but my aunt in Tyler, Tx did.  She meticulously recorded from A&E this whole series.  They did not show it all in one sitting -- just maybe 30 minutes here sometimes just 15 minutes of a 5 or 6 hour production.  Sometimes she didn't even know it was coming on, but she would pop a tape in if it did.  Then she pieced it all together and gave us a copy of it.   <br /> <br />We watched that I don't know how many times and loved it!!  The gypsy scene is definitely wonderful and was not on the vhs version I had.  So now finally they have put the whole production on this dvd!!   Folks buy this one!!  I just can hardly wait to see if there are some pieces my aunt missed!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril is a very talented artist. She plays guitar, piano, drums and has a good voice. I was at her a concert awhile back and she did a great job. People need to back off of her, she is just being herself and I think it is great she doesnt care what people think!
0375707972|5.0|This is a wonderfully constructed novel in every aspect.  It tells the story of a young man, his older lover and his rediscovering her while he is a law student and she is on trial for Nazi war crimes. There is a wonderfully dramatic scene during the trial.  Layer upon layer of meaning and questions evolve from the narrative, the characters. In retrospect the reader sees 'clues' to the secret held by the woman that generate a moral delemma and pose social questions relevant today. <br /> <br />If a task of a really good novel is to draw the reader into a world and have him see through others eyes a different reality that changes the reader's insight, this novel more than meets that goal.
B000002UAR|5.0|Following up the groundbreaking \\"Rubber Soul\\" must have seemed a Herculean task when George Martin and the boys entered the studio to cut this. Indeed, the bored voice counting in at the start of the album presages disaster, making what comes after al the more of a shock. What \\"Revolver\\" did hasn't been done since: The Beatles incorporated experimentalism into the standard 3 minute pop song form without it sounding forced and without being pretentious about it. They also demonstrated that you can make a song sound complex while it's fairly simple in its basic parts. (Listen to how simple the individual parts are on \\"Good Day Sunshine\\". A beginning music student could probably master most of them, save the piano, but the genius is how it all comes together in a thick gestalt that's far more than its components.)<br /><br />Choosing highlights is difficult, but I've narrowed it to 6 tracks:<br />\\"Taxman\\" is very basic musically but contains probably the cleverest line of George's career (\\"My advice for those who die? Declare the pennies on your eyes\\"). The trailing guitar solo points the way toward the blazing abandon of punk, as another reviewer correctly observes. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" remains a look at the universality of solitude, neatly stitching together the downtrodden characters without being maudlin or manipulative. Paul's Beach Boys homage \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" features probably the most gorgeous harmonies the band ever cut and a delicious melody. \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" is another undersung number in the Beatles catalogue: a charging signature riff from George, Paul's nimbly dancing bass line, the powerful vocal harmonies (especially on \\"And your bird can swing!\\"). The brass blasts on \\"Got to Get You into my Life\\" are superb and it really takes off at the end as Paul tears into the lyric \\"then SUDDENLY I see you...\\". The great achievement of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is that while striving for new sonic textures it doesn't sacrifice melody in the bargain. Backward guitar, instruments panned across the stereo image and processed vocals never seem \\"gimmicky\\". Even if, like me, you've never experimented with any sort of drugs, you're taking the tab with John for the 3 minutes it plays.<br /><br />The further proof of \\"Revolver's\\" strength is that \\"Yellow Submarine\\"'s 2:40 of audio theater, \\"Good Day Sunshine\\"'s trilling piano,the hazy backward guitars of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" or a fine ballad like \\"For No One\\" with its buoyant French horn aren't the best songs on the album, which they would be on nearly any other of the period.<br /><br />The two weakest 2 songs on here are \\"Dr. Robert\\" and \\"I Want to Tell You\\", and of those 2, \\"Dr. Robert\\" picks up steam toward the end so it's at least good if not at the level of the other tunes around it. I really wouldn't miss \\"I Want to Tell You\\" if it were gone.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />I believe this is the Beatles' shining hour. I would start my collection right here, then move on to \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\".ar, instruments panned across the stereo image and processed vocals never seem \\"gimmicky\\".

0385720920|4.0|Palahniuk has realized the will of to be addicted something in the deepest dark place of human beings. The whole life made up by nothingness which has no meaning except the interpretations of intellect minds. Everything is a fiction which can be imagined differently by any mind who has an intellectual capacity. And every single individual has different dependencies with the earth. These dependencies construct the imagines of world.     The mother of the hero says \\"now you have seen the real mountain for the first time\\". This was the one of the most important messages of the book. Leaving all dependences behind brings the real world to the individual... The whole world is, what it is, and nothing else but the imaginations of minds.    A very well written book...

0783219695|3.0|The two disc \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" is worth renting, but not worth replacing your original Apollo 13 DVD for. The first disc contains the theatrical release plus the bonus features as found on the previously released \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD.    There are 2 new short programs on the 2nd disc, with a few interesting tidbits, but the 2004 Mars rover landing is spoken about in the future tense, and the Columbia disaster isn't mentioned. In other words, the data was already dated by the time of its inclusion on this 2005 10th Anniversary Edition's release.    The 2nd disc also features the \\"IMAX\\" version, but it is hardly worth the watch as nearly 25 minutes have been hacked out and the color correction has been heavy-handed with the reds too intense and the skin tones too gold at times. Very disconcerting!    Overall, the \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD of this great film is a miss and only worth purchasing if you don't already have the film in your collection.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Generally regarded as Bon Scott's Best (and many will agree the Band's best) album, it is certainly the band's most radio-friendly produced album. The band tried for a more commercial sound, and it paid off big time. Highway to hell, Touch Too Much, Shot Down In Flames, If You Want Blood, all have become AC/DC staples. Mutt Lange's production proves he can be successful with any genre of music. Probably the first AC/DC album you should purchase to see if you like this kind of heavy thunk. Of course after the most successful thing they did, Bon went and died, giving him almost legendary status. (What would have been next? many wonder.)Typical. Although the band was concerned with his vocals in the studio before his death, many have done much more with much less talent afterwards. I don't see this should have been such a big concern for the band. After all, Bon was still delivering the goods onstage. Recommended.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews, but I have been telling everyone and anyone about this movie and what a wonderful experience it was to watch it.  <br /> <br />As a personal aside to this review: I am a film student and a fiction writing major. Before I saw this film, I was having problems at school with a teacher, she basically was destroying my passion for writing. Then I saw this movie. It was so inspirational to me that since veiwing it 3 days ago I have found it hard to stop writing. I think it was the performance of Johnny Depp and the overall story that made me realize how good it made feel to write. I love to write and this movie got me back into what I love to do.  <br /> <br />One thing that stands out most to me was how Johnny Depp told this movie through his eyes. I know it sounds weird but its true. Critical moments in the movie where the children asked him a question you could look into his eyes while he responded and you knew he was telling the truth. Thats what I would say is great acting. Not only being able to recite the dialog but also to encompass the character right down to his mannerisms.  <br /> <br />The story was remarkable and supporting cast of Winslet and Hoffman were outstanding. Truly a great achievement on the part of all that took part in this movie.   <br /> <br />
B00008BXJ6|3.0|Three stars simply because it is a compilation. By itself it is not bad, and actually very good, but if you are more than a casual listener, get the Original Australian High Voltage (with the red cover and Dog) and T.N.T. This album is actually T.N.T with some tracks added and some deleted. Little lover and She's Got Balls still annoy me to no end. These were tracks from the original High Voltage. Why this was called High Voltage and Not T.N.T is still a mystery as most of the tracks were from T.N.T and not High Voltage.
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell's an interesting writer...I liked his thing in the New Yorker about copyright laws and how slippery artistic property is... but this book left me a little dry...
B00008WT5E|3.0|Here is the follow-up to Let There Be Rock. This album toned down the overdriven amps of it's predecessor, and that is not necessarily a good thing. A Somewhat boogie/blues album that just doesn't seem finished. George Young's production is not bad, however. Powerage just doesn't seem to have too much rage with exception of maybe Riff Raff. Not too many of the songs are that memorable. Sin City is a concert fave, as was Riff Raff, but everything else? Not imperative. The European LP contained Cold Hearted Man instead of the single Rock N Roll Damnation- about an even exchange, plus many of the cuts had different edits and mixes- worth finding if you are a completist.

B000646MNE|5.0|What can you say about such a hugely popular series, which also happens to be the best series ever? Usually popularity does not guarantee quality, quite the contrary. But in this case, for once, the masses got it right. This little series, taken from the book about single New York girls, introduced us to our  sweetheart sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw,  and her close knit group of girlfriends. Samantha, the good hearted  slut, Charlotte, the relative priss, and Miranda, the successful attorney with her defenses always up to avoid real intimacy/hurt. Their trials and tribulations in their liberated pursuit for love in The City had people hooked from the very beginning. But, who would have known that it would have become quite possibly the best show in t.v. history? Breaking taboos, with strong women no less, just hadn't happened until \\"Sex.\\" To say they pushed the envelope is an understatement. What put this groundbreaking series light years ahead of the rest was the almost unheard of quality of writing and acting, designed specifically for adults. Try getting that at the local movie theater, or on almost all of television, for that matter, it just doesn't happen. Though I have my favorites from this entire six season series, there isn't an episode that doesn't delight to this day. I am not one to get hooked on t.v. series, but what \\"Sex\\" offered was so witty, touching, sophisticated, hysterically funny, and, well...REAL, it was just an unbeatable combination. It is hard to imagine this series without the four actresses who play \\"our girls\\", and especially impossible to imagine it without Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw. I don't know whether the producers intended for her to be such a main force at the inception of this series, but she quickly established herself as the lead character, and, as executive producer to boot. What is even more amazing is that over the course of her increasing prominence and importance to the series, there is not, in the entire six years of production, even the slightest hint of any rivalry between the actresses, and their spirit of on screen generosity apparently translated off screen as well. This entire class act should serve as an example for all other productions in general. Not only in its quality, but, in the all around camaraderie that is evident, which is so rare in television, where unknowns make it big overnight, turn into demanding brats.... which is usually followed by their banishment into obscurity, or, at best, selling ThighMasters on Q.V.C. To the end, the cast of \\"Sex\\" remained the very definition of the term \\"ensemble cast.\\" All involved in this series very smartly decided to go out on top, and the final episodes brought six years of fun, tears, and real friendship to a wonderful sense of closure that has not been duplicated, and probably never will. The series ending is without question the most touching, heartwarming, satisfying ending ever written. Is it obvious that I, like many, many others, loved \\"our girls?\\" Hell, I'm smitten, and I look forward to this wonderful set of dvd's providing me with years of renewed pleasure, and a sense of quality that I'm sure will only grow with time. Let's raise a toast to these four fabulous ladies, and all involved in this effort, for not only entertaining us, but, I don't think it's a stretch to say they taught us alot, especially about the value of true friendship.ears of production, even the slightest hint of any rivalry between the actresses, and their spirit of on screen generosity apparently translated off screen as well.

B00009OKOC|5.0|This is a great record. It still has the crunching,trippy guitars and punk ferocity we've come to expect from Queens of the Stone Age but there is something else. At times, there seems to be some pop sensibilities thrown in, along with some great melodies -- and that's not necessarily a bad thing!
B000003TAR|5.0|Not as popular as Nevermind, but it's just as good if you don't mind that it has a more raw sound, and stranger lyrics.

B0002YCVXI|5.0|The music is highly recognisable. Beautiful and expressive playing from YoYo Ma. Morricone's re-arrangements of his classic film scores make this album to treasure. There is something for everyone in terms of tunes. I personally didn't enjoy all the tracks, but as a whole, a great album.
B00009L1OB|2.0|The reason Duran Duran became an international phenomenon in the early '80's was their good looks.  These guys photographed well and looked good on-stage and on film.  Music would always be a secondary consideration. <br /> <br />\\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" shows Duran Duran's musical formula beginning to wear thin.  What's amazing is the fact that these guys had only been recording for a couple of years by the time this album was released.  Most great bands are just beginning to hit their peak at this stage.  Duran Duran never had a musical peak. <br /> <br />Duran Duran had a vocalist who could barely sing, fairly good instrumentalists, and cryptic lyrics at best.  But you really can't compare Duran Duran to a band like, say, The Clash- who also had members who could barely sing or play.  The Clash, at least, could write great lyrics.  Their music was powerful and hit you like a right cross.  Bowie wrote cryptic lyrics.  But he was able to make even his most cryptic lyrics memorable with his remarkable voice and fantastic stage presence.   <br /> <br />So what have you got with Duran Duran.  A bunch of pretty faces.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|this is just an awsome collection of many of michael's hits. there is great music on here to enjoy. some to sit bacdk and remember those days. when things were diffrent in this world. a diffrent place and time back then.. my favorites are billie jean, bad beat it, thriller, and so many more. if you want this for a collection kinda thing then this is for you.. but i do agree there is still many left out aswell. but i guess thats why they box other box sets right? well again this is a good one.. no matter the outcome of michael's trial. his music is still one of the best to me and always will be he is the king of pop. a fan.... kelly,
B00025ETIW|3.0|I've only heard two songs by this group, \\"I'm not okay\\" and \\"Helena\\". Now, I admit, the song \\"I'm not okay\\" is kinda catchy, but also kinda annoying. But I saw the video for \\"Helena\\" the other day and now I'm going to buy the album because 1. it's a good song AND video and 2. I need some new music. The only reason I'm writing a review is because there are a LOT of people writing stupid reviews based on \\"you should listen to this hardcore metal thrash band instead\\" blah blah blah nonsense. If you don't like it you don't like it, but don't recommend bands that you like just because you don't like what others do. And insulting the people who do like this cd by calling them pimply faced lazy slacker homosexuals is ridiculous. Now I have another reason to buy this cd. To piss off all those idiot metal heads who don't want this band to be big. Later.
0784011176|3.0|The image quality is horrible (partially a result of the principal photography, but mostly due to a poor transfer), it is not anamorphic 16:9, there are no bonuses or supplements. If \\"The Crying Game\\" can get a special edition, so can this one. It's time. Given the lush, beautiful score a new multi-channel audio remix is also mandatory. As always, director and/or cast commentary is a must. A great, visually sumptuous, erotic drama.
B000003C4K|5.0|This is the album i used to ride my bmx bike (3 F\\"en miles) to highschool. This is the only EXODUS album you need to own. OH the good old days. this album is the eppitomy (who knows how to spell it?) of metal!!
B0006SSOHM|4.0|There has been an abundance of reviewers and critics who have said that this movie was bad.  I on the other hand thought that Saw had a great plot and a very stunning end.  I wouldn't give it a full 5 stars because of the very very end.  This movie is very entertaining though and will keep you riveted the entire time.
B0006399FS|3.0|First, U2 is probably the best band performing today. They have a grandeloquent vision in their music that is based in modern rock n roll and Celtic memory. This album, which has already tanked on the charts,...finds itself populated with unfocused and rambling songs sounding alot like other U2 songs...Bono always sings great and the lilting after affects of the songs here are not to be dismissed. Nonetheless, the only songs I think that stand out and will last in concert five years from now are \\"Peace and Love\\" and \\"One Step Closer To Knowing\\"...Also outside of one obscure reference to our troups on the ground in Irag, this album should have had some in your face anti-war songs instead of lines like \\"Mama better cool down...\\" and on another level I totally do not see his perspective about the distance between a man and a woman nor his his dismissal of romance for true love...as if they are diametrically opposed???...sounds like he is trying to justify his long term marriage/relationship in view of the real world of rock stardom....which is fine but sounding like rationlization to me...anyway this is all pleasant enough and has a few good lines and a few good licks...
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is an awesome cd.  I believe that everyone should own a copy of green day/american Idiot.  It has outstanding songs like Holiday ,American Idiot, and the one and only Boulevard of broken dreams.  So make Green Day a very happy and exciting day.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|What else can be said about this Great movie? First of all Richard Roxburgh steals the movie as Count Dracula. He was the best choice for the role. The special effects are the greatest I have ever seen! For once we can see Dracula and his Brides transform on screen like never before. <br /> <br />The opening was Classic in Black And White paying homage to the old Universal Films of the thirties. Hugh Jackman is classic as the monster hunter, no one could have played it like him. The transformation scenes are fantastic as you see a man change to wolf, the charchter of Igor was also first rate, again going back to the old Universal Films. Richard Roxburgh is perfectly sinister as Dracula, you wanted to see more of him! <br /> <br />Dracula's Bride's are the most Beautiful women I have ever seen on film. Richard Roxburgh met his future Wife doing this movie. I can't wait for the sequel to be made! I am also looking forward to the animated DVD, \\"Van Helsing- The London Assignment\\" due out in april. This is a movie you can watch over, and over again it will always keep you on the edge of your seat.
B0007CNXUU|4.0|This is a great movie with a pretty good plot.  It has the actor Jonny Depp from Pirates of The Carribbean.  Which is one of my favorite movies, so naturally I took a look at this one.  Actually I thought I would be bored.  I thought it would be some boring thing on how he made Peter Pan.  I was wrong.  I am glad to inform you that this movie was not boring.  It had some pretty funny imaginative parts where the playwright James Barrie would imagine adventuristic lands.  So check out this movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I live probably as far as possible from NYC but I love musicals and  I try to be up to date. When I heard about WICKED I didn't actually believe I could enjoy the musical that looked rather like something for kids, but I must say the music is absolutely amazing. I read the script for the play so I know the backstory and it gives a lot more emotions to the listening. Sure, there are some weaker moments but after some time you start to love all the songs equally and  wholeheartly. This is truly modern musical, which will be remembered after one or two decades as a sign of our time. I'm glad that we will be proud for it. And it'll work even if you don't see the play, so what are you waiting for?
0385510438|4.0|\\"The Last Juror\\" is a great novel. It has a ton of suspense throughout the entire story. Also, there is a lot of mystery in the story too. In fact, I never knew what was going to happen next, what was going to be said, and what new major event would arise. The great amount of mystery and suspense in this novel will keep you guessing the entire time. Overall, I think the novel was pretty well rounded. It has its problems, but yet all novels do. The main problem that I found with the novel was that there was just to many pages filled with information that was not that essential to the story. Many of the pages could have been taken out or at least been replaced by something that relates to the main topic better. I love the characters though. They were awesome. John Grisham did such a great job creating them and connecting them to the real world. Throughout the entire novel, I felt that I could really connect to the characters and relate to what they were going through, because they seemed to be so real. It is like everything in the book actually happened and is real because everything and everybody in the story is so life like. The parts of the story that deal with legal matter are really exciting and attention grabbing. I found myself reading faster and faster through these parts. Parts like these just make you want to keep reading until the end. Even though the story has parts that are prolonged to much and are not that relevant to the main idea, I still give \\"The Last Juror\\" two thumbs up. Who knows, maybe John Grisham made all of the extra information on purpose to serve as the thing that separates this novel of his from the rest.
0767817478|4.0|The renovation of the character and the CGI imagining of Godzilla are inspired. As a child, watching the earlier Godzilla movies, my naivete would fill in the gaps, making up for all of the low level special effects. This Godzilla is more than I could ever have imagined as a child and more than I expect as an adult. AWESOME!<br /><br />Making the movie even better is the intelligence given to the creature. I wanted to see more of what this Godzilla could do if they had not written IT out of the script (Godzilla, unfortunately, is not compatible with Manhatten Island and must be eliminated). If only the movie had not had to end. Well, it doesn't if you own the DVD! THIS Godzilla with it's fluid movements and intelligence: it is alive and real. The underwater scenes were completely unexpected and are some of the best visualizations of the movie. They complete the complexity of Godzilla's character left unfullfilled in the first generation monster. Imagine if the director had added cameleon affects... here's hoping for future sequels.<br /><br />The face lift given this unique Godzilla seems so plausable and made me want to take him home as a pet and since his partial to fish he won't eat the other pets. Yet some of us may feel uncomfortable due to our 50+ years of fond memories for the First. Notwithstanding my fond memories and desire for nastagia, first is not always best; this is a more believable creature... more of what we expect from our age of imaging technology. There is no mistaking this Godzilla for a man in a rubber suit. Open your mind to this New Godzilla... whom I consider the GREATEST GODZILLA of them all.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the DVD's added special effects commentary feature which when turned on tracks the directors thought processes for the full length of the movie. Very interesting and revealing. I learned a lot about movie making processes. A big plus. The music video by the Wallflowers is entertaining. I recommend seeing the trailers before each viewing. They build a rightful anticipation.<br /><br />Godzilla's end is an emoutional climax which leaves one aching for the innocent creature just as in the original 1954 version if not more. Except for campy acting (typical of all Godzilla movies) this movie is the BEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER with the GREATEST GODZILLA EVER! If the campy acting and coffee jokes weren't there to occasionally aliviate some the tension which the action and story builds, it might not have been safe to show your children.<br /><br />This is one fun movie which gets better with every viewing.<br /><br />I hope THIS Godzilla... returns!d a rightful anticipation.

B000002UJQ|5.0|So then technically its the best album ever correct? <br />I guess so.  Better than \\"pet sounds\\" \\"Daydream Nation\\" \\"Loveless\\" and \\"London Calling...\\" <br />I can't believe people cannot like this album...  It makes me angry, sad, and confused...
B0007O38F8|5.0|Read the title people...We all know whos on top...50 is been on top for four consecutive weeks and has sold more than 4 million albums in his first week alone...u know whos on top...and we know why as well...this album is so hot...i dun care what all the haters think...you all arnt sellin hit records so hate it or love it 50 Cent is on top and will be forever...so go out and buy this album its worth every penny..
B000000OSE|5.0|Yeah, this is good. <br />Of course, no matter how good the opening 14 tracks may be (and apart from Bad Apples, The Garden and Don't Damn Me, they are all excellent) nothing can hold a candle to Dead Horse and Coma. These are two very underrated tracks. Dead Horse has a great acoustic intro, leading up to some devilishly catchy hard rock. A great solo just completes the package. <br /> <br />And we move on to Coma. What can I say? If Estranged (similarly epic, equally excellent) is a song of lost love and catharsis, this is some sort of weird acid trip through Axl's messed up mind. A kick-ass riff, some haunting lyrics and wonderful musicianship throughout combine to make this possible the second best song G'n'R ever laid down, after Estranged. I love the claustrophobic edge this song has, the weird dangerous vibe. Listen to it on headphones, and you will be thinking about it for days. Similar to Pearl Jam's \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\" in that regard, but Coma is actually a song. And what a song. <br /> <br />Even without the other 14 tracks, these two songs would make this a must-have record. So Axl, if you've got any brain cells left, quit your belly aching and make some decent glam rock like you and the boys used to. Velvet Revolver are really showing you up at the moment.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|I think there are some interesting and creative tunes on this album.  However, there is an excessive amount of useless and frankly frustrating sound-effect junk put in for no apparent reason.  For example, The Widow is a pretty haunting and melodic song.  But the entire second half (2 and a half minutes out of 6) are stupid, warbling Space-Invaders nonsense.  I listened through it once, and now I skip to the next song right away.  The next song, L'Via L'Viaquez, is a great song, very creative with a rockin' guitar riff.  But once again, pure nonsense at the beginning -- static-like noise for 40 seconds.  Similarly, the last 5 minutes of this 12 minute song are also disappointing - a tedious slow-motion voice-distortion plodding through the chorus.  It adds nothing new, and it makes me skip to the next song.  What I'm left with is about 3 enjoyable minutes that I have to hunt for.  Similarly, the \\"Miranda\\" song has a full FOUR minutes of wailing winds before anything you could call \\"music\\" starts.  Then there's another FOUR minutes of the same kind of thing on the back end.  8 out of 13 minutes are useless!  \\"Cygnus\\" has 4 minutes of junk at the end also.  Is this a joke?  If I had an MP3 of this, I'd just cut off each end of the songs.  As it is now, the album wastes a lot of my time.   <br /> <br />There are other such gimmicks.  I appreciate the occasional sound-effect flourish or fade out, but this is just excessive nonsense filler and have really detracted from my enjoyment of the real music on the album.  People, let's make music, not sound effects. <br />
B000000OSG|5.0|Okay, I can admit that out of 14 tracks, there are 3 skippable songs (Get In The Ring, Shotgun Blues and My World). <br />But when a band like G'n'R puts together 11 songs as unbelieveably diverse, and consistently excellent, as these tunes, you have an instant classic on your hands. The sleaze from Appetite and UYI 1 have almost disappeared, leaving some epic songwriting and awesome guitar work from the superlative-defying duo of Slash & Izzy. <br /> <br />1 Civil War: 10/10 - Whoa. What an opener. From the Cool Hand Luke excerpt to the wonderful guitar virtuosity, to the genuinely touching lyrics, this is an epic unlike any other anti-war song. <br /> <br />2 14 Years: 9/10 - A great little blues rock, honky tonk number, giving Izzy room to shine. <br /> <br />3 Yesterdays: 10/10 - A lovely ballad, with some nice harmonies and a great video. <br /> <br />4 Knockin On Heaven's Door: 9/10 - Overplayed, over-rated and SO much better live, it still merits a 9/10 for turning a mediocre Dylan number into an incandescent glam rocker. <br /> <br />5 Get In The Ring: 4/10 - Embarrassing lyrics, hilarious rant, actually quite good music, but still near unlistenable. <br /> <br />6 Shotgun Blues: 4/10 - Like a bad rash, the embarrassing lyrics just wouldn't go away until... <br /> <br />7 Breakdown: 10/10 - Nice banjo intro! This is a genuinely beautiful song, if you ignore the weird deep voice in the chorus, which is totaly out of place. <br /> <br />8 Pretty Tied Up: 9/10 - Izzy wrote this one, and it rocks the bells! A verse on S&M, a verse on the decline of the band and a verse on the dangers of fame, all \\"tied up\\" (sorry) to a hard-rockin classic. <br /> <br />9 Locomotive: 10/10 - In no way overlong. The lyrics are actually wonderful, the music is funky, almost reminiscent of Rocket Queen in that regard. The piano outro is gorgeous. <br /> <br />10 So Fine: 10/10 - Duff, take a bow, my man! This is a beautiful piece of balladry, interspersed with great blues rock. Written for Johnny Thunders, but listen to it with a special someone in mind, and it makes so much sense. <br /> <br />11 Estranged: ?/10 - How high can you count? An awe-inspiring piece of work. Music as art, art as catharsis. Too many highlights to number, but special mention to THAT guitar solo, after Axl sings 'And what for?' Axl and Slash prove they've got the goods to rival any frontman/guitarist duo, ever. That means Page/Plant, Jagger/Richards, Tyler/Perry etc. I really can't put into words how impossible it is to over-rate this song. It is pure emotion on a little shiny disc, perhaps only matched by Hunger Strike by Temple of the Dog for sheer beauty. <br /> <br />12 You Could Be Mine: 10/10 - A classic hard-rocker, sleazy, arrogant and brilliant for it. If you liked You're Crazy, this goes even further into pure sexed-up glam rock. <br /> <br />13 Don't Cry: 9/10 - The original would get 10/10, because I prefer the lyrics, but as long as that solo is still there, I'm not complaining. A truly excellent power ballad, I could do without the strange extended 'toniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight' at the end. But if you think that's bad... <br /> <br />14 My World: 0/10 - I refuse to consider this a G'n'R song. Axl, if you think going in this direction is going to top what the boys have done with Velvet Revolver, you're sadly mistaken. No one wants to hear another lame rap-rock crossover act. <br /> <br />So, with G'n'R losing control over Axl, and the birth of grunge, this was the last classic album from the boys as a whole. Of course, everyone who has released an album since has managed to recapture some of the glory. Snakepit, any Stradlin solo LP, and of course, Velvet Revolver are all glorious rock records, and I can say from experience that VR are a top-notch live act. So Axl, get your act together fast, or you will lose all the status uo rightly deserve.
B000000OQF|1.0|Let me tell you something. This band was never \\"cool\\", and just because they were a bit famous back in \\"their day\\" doesn't mean they are good. Just because they got a couple of videos on MTV doesn't mean they are worth jack now. Times change, and now MTV only plays GOOD rock music and these losers are nowhere to be seen. I've never listened to this album but I can tell it sucks just from looking at pictures of the band. None of the rockers on TRL or the mall look like these guys so that means they must be bad. If you don't look cool then you can't produce good music. That's why Beethoven sucks. Thank god Nirvana saved music in the 90s.
B000000W5L|5.0|The last truly great album from the Stones.  They've done good albums since, but not great.  Rock 'n' roll doesn't get much better than this, but there are also blues and country elements throughout, so you've got a good weaving of styles on this album.  The only clunkers (to my ears anyway) are I Just Want to See His Face, Shine a Light and Let It Loose.  These songs aren't bad, but in my opinion the Stones set the bar very high with the other songs on this album, and these songs don't clear that bar for me. Be that as it may, this album is worth every penny.  Get it now!
B0001KL3SW|5.0|I was listening to a public radio station and heard her version of 'Moody's Mood for Love' and bought the CD on that song alone. I rarely purchase a CD one just one song.  I was rewarded with a refreshingly different \\"R&B\\" CD. She has a style and sound all her own but you can hear her obvious influences from the likes of Ella Fitzgearld and Sarah Vaughn. She sometimes sounds like Lauryn Hill.  <br />Perceptive songs about relationships and the things around her make for a timeless CD. It's even more remarkable because she was only 19 when this was released! <br />I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new artist to follow where you can't wait for them to release new material. I know I am!
B000000W5N|5.0|In my opinion, the Stones' finest work.  You've heard the standards all over classic rock radio - Brown Sugar, Wild Horses, Bitch.  Dig deeper - the nuggets here are Can't You Hear Me Knocking, Dead Flowers and Sister Morphine.  BTW, that's Ry Cooder playing the slide on Sister Morphine, not Mick Taylor.  Check the credits on the Virgin remaster if you don't believe me.  There's not a clunker in the bunch.  The same can't be said for Exile on Main Street (I Just Want to See His Face, Shine a Light and Let It Loose come to mind).  To get the full effect (especially Sister Morphine), play this album at night.  A \\"must-have\\" for any CD collection.
0066620996|2.0|Collins and his team, by their own admission, picked a handful of companies that fit into their very specific criteria, then lo-and-behold those companies all had the same characteristics?!?!? <br />The nature of the study even admits that most of the time, someone on the inside of a company cannot see the bigger picture going on - the very same bigger picture that you need to see in order to achieve Good To Great success. Collins then concedes that the only way you can tell you're on the right track is when it's all said and done. <br />Don't waste your money on this. <br />The lessons of this book can fairly be summarized in about 2 pages.
B000066F6H|5.0|The only bad song on this CD is 'Find Another Girl'. Other than that this whole thing is frickin' awsome. Gritty, loud, in-your-face, AND catchy! It's the best punk since the Sex Pistols.
B00063MBU8|1.0|\\"IDC what you're into, if you're in high school or college, having relationship problems, parent problems or just upset about certain social issues, simple plan has a song you can relate to\\" <br /> <br /> <br />hilarious. <br /> <br />yes everyone goes thru problems in life but why whine about it? <br /> <br />If you want music that talks about emotions listen to Alice in Chains, Burzum, Suicidal Tendencies, and Old metallica. <br /> <br />BANDS WITH TALENT!
B00008EY65|4.0|In a time when super hero movies are slowly regaining their popularity, Hellboy unfortunately sits somewhere at the back of the class, smoking a cigar.  Not worthy of much more than an exciting shout during its action sequences and an occasional chuckle at Ron Pearlman's witty rhetoric, the movie does have a bad habit of letting its viewers down a little too often.  There are other characters who should be more developed, but are not.  Story concepts that could be profound, but fall just short of eye-opening.<br /><br />Regardless, Hellboy is a film that sets out to do what many blockbuster films are meant to do:  entertain.  If the film had been boasted as \\"a work of art\\" then viewers would have good reason to be disappointed.  But the film is lush with eye-candy special effects, edge of your seat fight scenes, and Ron Pearlman is the perfect choice to play Hellboy.  Too many actors try too hard to capture the torn anti-hero who is just on the edge of switching sides, but Pearlman does an exceptional job.  His interpretation of Hellboy shows an anti-hero that is just having too much fun beating the bad guy (although he may never admit it).<br /><br />DVD buyers should know that this film is worth the price.  Amidst a group of recent superhero adaptations that have not been afraid to break the rules, Hellboy may sit at the back of the class, but is too large to go unnoticed.
B00063MBU8|1.0|THIS SO CALLED &quot;BAND&quot; HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE! PEOPLE CALL THIS MUSIC? PLEASE! WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE THESE WHINERS SERIOUSLY? THEY SOUND LIKE A BUNCH OF KINDERGARTENERS COMPLAINING ABOUT BULLIES PUSHING THEM AROUND IN THE PLAYGROUND DURING RECESS! NO WONDER PEOPLE DON'T TAKE CANADIAN MUSIC SERIOUSLY, WE GOT FOOLS LIKE THESE LOSERS GOING AROUND AND MAKING A MOCKERY OUT OF US! DO US ALL A FAVOR BOYS AND STOP MAKING YOUR SO CALLED &quot;MUSIC&quot; CAUSE FRANKLY IT SUCKS!
B0007PAMR4|5.0|According to TheDigitalBits.com, the reason for the delay of the Dune: Extended DVD is that David Lynch decided that he wanted to be a part of the DVD after all! This all means that the DVD will eventually come out. I know that everyone was disappointed about the supposed \\"cancellation\\" of the DVD. But,hopefully, it will be worth the wait to see a possible interview/commentarie with Lynch and maybe even a true directors edition.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|First of all, lets say that this is a great record. the problem is: this is a QOTSA record, and there's not enough greatness here for the standards QOTSA use to deliver. Why? Because there are two problems. The little problem is that youre gonna hear Mark Lanegan only on the first track (which happens to be the most irrelevant track of the CD); and the big problem is that Nick Oliveri is not with the band anymore, which means a great lack of power and attitude, when you compare \\"Lullabies....\\" with previous QOTSA offerings. I think one of the best things about QOTSA is diversity, and Homme and Oliveri have always been the two halfs of the whole. Getting just one half results in a darker, less-inspired, straight record. On the other hand, you'll only hear Homme's voice here, and you'll note that he's tryin to sound different from one song to another, but thats not QOTSA at all, specially when such great songs like \\"Tension Head\\" or \\"Hangin Tree\\" come to your mind. To tell you the truth, this CD sounds more like \\"The lost diaries of Josh Homme\\", rather than a new QOTSA record. But dont get me wrong: there are a bunch of great songs here (\\"Little Sister\\", \\"Medication\\", \\"Everybody knows that you're insane\\", or the ultra-catching \\"In my head\\"), but, as I said before, not great enough, if you are a TRUE fan of QOTSA, not just a fan of Homme. I respect al the 5 and 4 stars reviews around but, even admitting that I use to hear the record a lot, I have to be honest with myself. Let's just believe the odds sayin that Oliveri will rejoin the band soon. Let's just believe it ok?
B00005B36H|5.0|To put into crude words what has to be a deeply moving and hard-hitting musical masterpiece is a difficult task. Tool's \\"Lateralus\\" certainly does not make it easy to define or describe it.<br /><br />The music has a surreal quality to it, which is only enforced by the voice that complements it. The overall feel and effect is music that is pleasantly otherworldly, and definitely unique. Despite this, it still retains punch and impact. If you are looking for music that is original and redefines a genre, then this is it.<br /><br />The music is saturated with spiritual overtones, which just add depth to the journey that the CD takes you on.<br /><br />The sounds have combined well to produce a surreal and unique work. Tool certainly have reached a pinnacle in their art and they have delivered a profound and moving musical journey.
B00009W8N2|4.0|Damnation was such a great CD that, although my metalhead days are long behind me, I decided to pick up just one of their death metal CD's out of morbid curiosity (pun intended.)  As I expected, Opeth in death metal mode is an entirely different sort of beast than the morose proggers on Damnation.  Musically, they sound like the best prog-metal band you've ever heard.  The vocals are another story, as Mikael Akerfeldt \\"sings\\" about 90% of the time in full on death metal cookie monster growl, and the other 10% or so clean.  As for the \\"death\\" part, lyrically it's all about the doom-n-gloom, not the blood-n-guts.  One look at the evocative song titles makes that pretty clear.<br /><br />Almost all of the songs are very long, with the rampant tempo and key changes and switching from electric to acoustic that are associated with the prog genre.  Opeth's twist is that they never seem to repeat the same phrase twice in those long compositions.  If you were to plot one of their songs on paper it would just go from point A to B to C and on and on with no repeats.  As a guitar player, I can't imagine how they keep their places in these songs on stage, and the fact that they pulled it off even once in the studio is a remarkable feat of musicianship.<br /><br />It's a really unique method of song structure (or un-structure might be more correct) but they do it well, making each section seem like it belongs with the others, and giving each song it's own feel and sound.  There are a couple of shorter interludes including an out-of-nowhere classical piano piece by drummer Anders Nordin that is quite well done.<br /><br />I'm not sure who to recommend this to other than the death metal fans who already know them.  Prog fans who happen to love death metal are a rare breed I would imagine, but it is tailor made for them.  Adventurous metal and prog fans will find much to get into here.<br /><br />I like this CD, but probably won't get any more of the earlier ones, although it's an interesting addition to the small metal section of my collection.t's an interesting addition to the small metal section of my collection.
0684833395|5.0|\\"Catch 22\\" is a reknowned classic for good reason. The book takes you on a journey that borders on the insane into the world of a squadron of WW2 medium-level bombers. With a cast of interesting characters who each have some serious issues and choose some interesting ways to deal with them, this book takes you on a wild ride.<br /><br />The character dialogues are excellent, and convey much of the sense of impending insanity that seems to lurk just under the surface. Orr and his crab apples in his cheeks, (because they are better than horse chestnuts), is a good example of the mental instability that most characters seem to exhibit.<br /><br />The book is brilliantly written and it has a great flow to it. Different characters all add their own qualities to the mix, making for a combination of personalities that will leave you laughing in distrubed nervousness. Darkly comic, this book is a laugh and a deserved classic that is sure to endure for generations to come.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I saw this on PBS and thought it was awsome..I really want to buy a few copies for my family - my Mom is nuts about this music, and to be honest I wouldn't mind one myself!! I'm only 26 but I find the music really exciting. The girls are also totally cool!! but amazon doesn't seem to stock them or something weird. What's with that? I'm going to try my local store. :-(
B00080ZG10|2.0|Basically, I hated it. There: I got it out. The story was boring to me, and it was a very long one, at that. I suspect that I have not had any exposure to what another reviewer referred to as the \\"Hughes Legend\\", (I think the quote is accurate). I guess the movie would be more interesting with more familiarity with the enigmatic Hughes and his life.<br /><br />Despite my negative opening, I have to give credit for a few things. One is the acting of Leonardo Di Caprio, which was absolutely awesome. Di Caprio put on a stellar performance in what must have been a singularly demanding and difficult role. This has been the best I have seen from Di Caprio, and he deserves all accolades for it. Di Caprio truly shone in this movie.<br /><br />Secondly, the visual presentation and photography were excellent. The attention to detail was excellent, which helped carry the viewer into the story and the time. I would add that I was disappointed that so much of the aircraft scenes relied on computer graphics to achieve. Call me old fashioned, but some flying replicas would have been nice, if possible. It has to be emphasised that some of the aircraft scenes were the best in the movie, so this comment is really a quibble of mine.<br /><br />Other notable performances were Allan Alda and Alec Baldwin. Both put in great performances and were brilliant in their supporting roles.<br /><br />I would not recommend \\"The Aviator\\", due to long slow march of it into sedation. However, for those with an interest in Howard Hughes and aviation, it would be of interest. For any Di Caprio fans, Di Caprio's acting makes enduring the movie almost worth it. He was great!
B00005NGZX|5.0|Converge is by no means your average hardcore band. I look at them as a musical force to be reckoned with. Of course, Jane Doe may sound like garbled incoherence to the untrained ear. I guess you need to be able to find beauty in chaos in order to enjoy this record. Either that, or you have a good amount of diversity in the music you enjoy.  <br /> <br />I find myself rotating 'Petitioning' a bit more than 'Jane Doe' but, 'Jane' has a great asthetic. A lovely little assault on the senses that never fails in being menacing, beautiful, and outright insane. Those who are quick to dismiss Converge and other similar bands as 'horrid noise' would probably never say such things if they gave this record and impartial listen. I dont care what type of music you enjoy... it took talent to write this album.  <br /> <br />Jane Doe contains quite a bit of complexity and overall intensity buried beneath the whirring hiss of the sheer speed of most of this record. Any musician should be able to appreciate this album. I look at this slab of wax as a 45 minute progessive shift from complete chaos to a sort of de-evolving, maniacal form of rock and roll.  <br /> <br /> <br />There you have it. An opinion from a fan of MUSIC. Regardless of genre, musical barriers, etc.... I believe Converge's Jane Doe to be an excellent, atmospheric, techical slaughter of the eardrums. It is that and much much more. If you've made it this far, I hope this was more than a tough-guy's rambling of: \\"Dude... this CD is awesome, because all my friends say so. Buy it!\\"
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I admit that I am a big Marillion fan and share the frustration others have mentioned here about not hearing them on the radio.  Also, I am one of those fans that paid Marillion before Marbles was done just to have the chance to hear it.<br /><br />This album is fascinating.  The melodies are pure rock n roll with lots of meaning, thought and insite into the band's world.  If you are a fan of Genesis, Pink Floyd or Asia, you MUST buy this album.  You will not be dissappointed.
B00005JNRB|5.0|First off, Sahara is not a Comedy, but an Adventure with Humor. Secondly, its obvious Gentleman Caller 83 has never heard of Clive Cussler, or read any of his books - considering if he had, he would have understood the first fact.

1400032717|5.0|Christopher John Francis Boone is autistic, he's also the narrator of this funny yet touching story. He is a genius in math and science but cannot function very well socially. He hates being touched and can't stand the colors yellow or brown, but he wants to find out who murdered his neighbor's dog. He goes about trying to figure it out as if he was a detective in a murder mystery but uncovers some things about his life that are surprising.<br /><br />Although it has some harsh language, this book is brilliant. The author captures the thought process of an austitic child believably. The story would be pretty simple if told traditionally but this spin of the narrator being a special needs child makes the book more interesting and clever. A must read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Peter Harmon for Flamingnet Book Reviews ([...])
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I love this movie.  Gaston is so handsome and has such a beautiful voice and is such a crumb.  Belle is not all that attractive and she is snooty.  The Beast is a big jerk.  But it all comes back to the happy ending.  Although Gaston bites it in the end.
B00064MW6A|2.0|What were viewers wanting from this movie?  Well, it's hard to say, except that fans of Halle Berry's ass will not be disappointed, since it is lovingly filmed numerous times from a variety of angles.  Needless to say, this is very revealing, from a marketing and target audience perspective.  The movie also boasts some of the worst CGI in recent memory, as well as Sharon \\"I'm still a beautiful woman\\" Stone flaunting her own luscious butt cheeks, wearing skin-tight pants as often as possible.  Various studio mouth pieces and feminists have blamed the failure of \\"Catwoman\\" and \\"Elektra\\" on the notion that \\"Americans aren't ready for a female super hero\\".  Boo-hoo.  (They're wrong.  We just don't want a female superhero movie that SUCKS.)  Take a look at \\"Monster's Ball\\" and you'll see that the opposite is true:  maybe we just expect quality work from our favorite actresses.

B0006399FS|1.0|I was sadly dissapointed to discover that while this cd is filled with modern rock music, there is no mention of how to dismantle an actual atomic bomb.  While I have the titanium shell off, I can't seem to get around all the wires and gizmos.  Thanks a lot U2.
B0000025C0|4.0|The Boston album that followed the BIG first one. Don't look back gives the listener more of the same that you heard from the first effort except that Tom Scholtz wasn't given proper  time to complete this opus. Side one took the man several years to complete and let me tell you..perfection is a word that comes to mind first. Side one flows together seemlessly and is sublime to hear. Sholtz's then modern sound still sounds fresh today because of the effort that was put into the crafting of the \\"perfect\\" sound. The Boston sound cannot be reproduced because it lives and dies with Tom Scholtz. One could compare side one of \\"Don't look back\\" to side two of the Beatles \\"Abby Road\\" in the perfection of song blending. Scholtz was forced to hurry production of side two to meet Epic's demand of a quicker follow-up to the band's first album, the result is an obvious difference in the quality of the arrangements of the songs. That being said, side two still has plenty to offer in quality, its just  that side one was sooo perfect it renders side two as a bit of a letdown. A good party record (back in the day)  but still worthy of crtical listening today. Scholtz and Co. caught plenty of flack from average fans because of his deliberate work ethic and unreal standards equating many a year between releases, but in the end (as \\"Third Stage\\" showed), the proof is in the final product, and as time has shown... haste makes waste. A often forgotten classic from the 1970s.
B0000035E7|5.0|This doesn't compare quite as well to any other Nirvana album when it comes to the sound quality or production value, but if you a true fan of Nirvana, these small faults won't deture you from enjoying it. \\"Bleach\\" was recorded and delivered well considering the album was cut for just slightly over $600.00. Had the band been more financially gifted, \\"Bleach\\" would have done far better when first released. This was not my first Nirvana album and I don't suggest this album for fist time listeners. With that said, this album is a must for your collection. The casual listener will appreiciate the work that can be found here once you give it a chance. Place it next to the other three Nirvana albums and enjoy the talent these guys had and the great rock songs they wrote before the \\"Nevermind\\" sessions began.
B000023VR6|5.0|If you listen to rap and appreciate it and the tracks behind it, you MUST own this album.  It will go down as one of the best produced, maybe not lyrics wise, but tracks wise, records of all time.
B000002U82|5.0|The title of my review sums it up.  I don't need to repeat the accolades found on the prior reviews, except to say that this album for me is more of a heartbreaker now when we consider the very ugly and sad state of affairs that we have in the music of today.<br /><br />To quote a film that I have since forgotten that will apply to the more religious among you:<br /><br />\\"Do you ever pray madam?  Are your prayers answered?  This music is the answer to your prayers.\\"
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is not the kind of CD were you constanly have to skip songs because you dont like them. All the songs are good! I love \\"Stut Up\\" which is the main reason i bought it...but the rest suprised me!!! If you liked the other CD by Simple Plan then purchase this one...its a keeper!
0671027387|3.0|After reading The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I have to admit I was disappointed with this one. The amount of research that went into the first two, that made them to be part non-fiction and part fiction, was lost on this one. The storyline is mediocre, and the narration is a tad fantastic. I like Dan's small chapters with each one stopping at a precipice. Read this book only if have read DVC and AAD and really like his style. Now, I am in two minds if I should look at Digital Fortress.
B000066C87|5.0|Gosford Park is not a murder mystery, nor will it ever be one. It is the subtle exploration of human relationships and their interactions. Altman does this expertly, carefully highlighting the elegant dance of words, emotions, and body language. Altman explores the relationships between the servants and the served, the aristocrats to one who does everything from \\"keep[ing] Ma Trentham in stockings and gin\\" to paying for his father-in-law to \\"swan around Biarritz six months out of the year.\\" The most interesting relationship, I believe, is that of Mabel Nesbitt to her husband, Freddie. Freddie regrets his marriage to Mabel, who is poorer than Freddie would like her to be. They fight, constantly, and I enjoy watching the relationship that Mabel develops to the movie star, Ivor Novello, also a guest. It's a one-way relationship, but her relationship best illustrates the subtle interplay between the characters in this film. <br /> <br />Some will undoubtedly find Gosford Park boring beyond belief--from a more superficial point, it IS a group of aristocrats talking and a group of servants talking. However, I see it differently. Every time I watch this film (best for rainy days to match the movie's mood) I notice something I didn't notice before. I'm probably on my 20th full viewing of it, and I'm still noticing the relationships, the hand gestures, the people in the background. The details in Gosford Park elegantly flesh out the film and make it a keeper, one worth watching several times over.

B000002HAJ|4.0|Second best Cure album only to Disintegration.  Songs range from beautiful, atmospheric tracks such as \\"from the edge of the deep green sea\\" to hard rockers such as \\"cut\\".  Their most solidly diverse album containing no throwaway tracks.  Robert Smith nails it again with his beautiful, mostly sorrowful lyrics.  My favorite tracks are \\"doing the unstuck\\" and \\"a letter to elise\\", but all are great.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album does not deserve five stras. I think it deserves four stars. However, when I opened the page and saw the average rating was just 3 star I ghasped and couldn't believe so many people were giving this 1 star so I had to give it five to pull it back up again. <br /> <br />However, when you read the one star reviews, they seem rather similar. (Come on three reviews next to each other submitted on the same day - one titled \\"awful music from awful band\\" and two identical ones called \\"bad music from bad group\\". Three one star reviews all written by the same person. And more like this further down.) And then you notice many are just taking shots at the group. I estimate that about 1/2 to 2/3 haven't even listened to the album but have given it a rubbish review anyway. IGNORE ALL THE ONE STAR REVIEWS! And for that matter ignore many of the five star reviews too. Quite a few are just fans who'd give anything of U2's five stars. Listen to the preview tracks and buy it for yourself. Give it a few listens. Then make your own mind up. Go hear some of the tracks live as well. <br /> <br />My favourite songs are City of Blinding Lights, All Because of You, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Youur Own and of course Vertigo. Man & Woman and 1 step closer, I'm not so sure about, but the rest are good.  <br /> <br />There are people who have said U2 have sold out and are now suddenly making safe \\"radio friendly\\" songs. Sold out from what? They have been played on radio since the early/mid 1980s. They have scored number 1 hits in the past. Surely they must have been radio firendly as well! <br /> <br />I am no U2 fan, but rock has never sounded so good in the 21st century - possibly the worst time for music ever. <br />
B000063DIR|1.0|Without beating a dead horse as in all the previous reviews, we must stand back and reflect on the implications of this \\"remastered\\" version of Diary Of A Madman.  Can you call this a remaster instead of a remix or a re-recording?  This question has already been posed by countless others and still we all agree that this CD is blasphemy on the part of Randy Rhoads and the rest of the original Blizzard Of Ozz.  Now, according to rumors and speculation and the facts surrounding the situation, Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley sued The Ozzman or the record company for unpaid royalties.  Court rulings fell towards the Ozz (where the money lies, of course) and Bob and Lee were dubbed mere \\"studio musicians\\", which is strange, because the orginal Blizzard toured the British Empire in mid-1980. (I have a great bootleg live set from Manchester, England from the latter part of that year.  They even did You Looking At Me, Looking At You live!  Incredible!)  So were Bob and Lee studio musicians or an integral part of the solo efforts of the former Sabbath frontman?  Was Randy Rhoads a studio musician?  What if his mother asked the studio for more royalties on Randy's work?  Would the leagal vultures strip the great Rhoads back to \\"hired gun\\" status?  Hmmmmm.  Hard to say.  What I see here is a legal issue and a monetary issue that went awry.  So Ozzy and Sharon decide, well, what the hey, let's record over Bob and Lee (insert middle finger here) and that way they won't have a chance to ask for money.  Still, their names appear on most of the Blizzard trax as co-writers.  Baffling?  Extremely.  The fact that they would even touch these albums (same said for Blizzard, which was recorded at the same time as Diary) boggles the mind.  Does Ozzy need the money?  Did we need another version of the songs contained herein? Why was this even done in the first place? Another interesting fact:  on the previous re-issue of Diary Of A Madman, Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge were said to have played on the album.  Never happened.  Hmmmm.  So when all is said and done and we're through bitching about the facts of the case, the song remains the same.  Don't f*ck with a masterpiece.  I grew up with Blizzard and Diary as two of my most sacredly favorite albums of all time and to taint their perfection with newly recorded butchery.  Well, that's just plain crazy!  Ozzy is a god, but Randy helped make him one, and so, probably, did Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley. (Bob's still on Bark At The Moon, by the way.  Why is that?) Would Blizzard or Diary have been as great without their influences?  Would Randy have shined as much as he did without their collaboration?  Why would anyone want to ask these questions?  You can't rewrite history, so don't re-record the classics.  Buy the older true remaster.  It soundz like it should.  This rubbish should be burned as sacriledge. Ozzy and Sharon should bow their heads in shame.on the album.  Never happened.  Hmmmm.

068484267X|5.0|This was one of the most beautiful audio book experiences ever! In this book there is a certain tone in the reading that helps to communicate this family's circumstance from the naive child's point of view.  McCourt sings for you the songs of his drunken father and it is worth a rewind/replay at times. Highly recommended!
076790592X|2.0|Its odd how this book supposes to be about Morrie's gradual decline and final-year's wisdom but it turns out to be about the authors seemingly bottomless fears about death.  The author verges on panic attack as Morrie gracefully flows away; somehow the author seems impervious to Morrie's  'teaching' though many of us readers probably 'get it'.  No doubt the author learned a lot about himself too, but in the end he seems to retain his immense dread of death.  Its these terribly fearful and panicked friends & relatives who ALWAYS ruin the experience of departing for the rest of us !
0312305060|1.0|I wanted to hear this book but after 3 separate tries of 30-60 minutes each, I gave up.  Sometimes authors should stick to writing and leave the reading to someone else.  This author has a very flat tone and odd cadence.  I can't recommend this audio version.
B000002OX5|4.0|The Who Sell Out (1967.), the Who's third studio album<br /><br />'The Who Sell Out' saw the band putting out their first concept album attempt and it works very well. In fact, the idea the Who came up with at the time of a concept album was pretty revolutionary and was one of the first of its kind (along with the Beatles' Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band concept album). With this album, the Who are now definitely showing signs of going onto greatness. After enjoying a few years as a popular mod band, as well as putting out two good, if not outstanding albums, the Who really started to put their mark on their music with 'Sell Out'. The ideas which would lead to their classic 'Tommy' album are definitely rooted in Sell Out.<br /><br />One thing about the Who, which made them and especially this album worthwhile to listen to was their sense of humour. 'Sell Out' is not short of amusing moments with its radio station theme and it makes this album a really enjoyable and worthwhile listen. Pete Townshend was never short of good ideas for his songwriting and theres plenty of solid material in this album (plus John Enthwhistle and Keith Moon also try their hand and some tracks and the results are pretty good). The overall music on the album is probably 4* quality but the sheer entertainment and ideas that the album has earns it the extra 1/2 star. You can hear elements of the later, more rock orientated Who but this album has very much a 60's style to it overall, especially with the large amounts of vocal harmonisation which characterises a very much 1960's sound.<br /><br />The Who took a risk with this album. They had not achieved great fame and success yet and this album, originally a double LP could have met a bad reception from the general public. However, they didn't disappoint and this overly light hearted affair reached #13 in the UK and #48 in the US. However, the radio theme did give the Who an opportunity to advertise products in the hope they would get freebies. Funnily it worked and the radio excerpts in between the tracks earned Keith Moon a free drum kit from Premier Drums and Rotasound Strings also offered the band freebies. Sadly the John Mason's cars advert didn't get the Who any free motors, to their disappointment! Like all Who studio albums, this one has been wonderfully remastered and the original 21 track album comes with bonus tracks (a 'Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand' alternate version and the 'Glow Girl' outtake). The album also comes with an extensive booklet with plenty of pictures too. The album cover itself is quite amusing, with the band members posing for different products.<br /><br />So, the tracks themselves. In between some funny radio braodcasts, there are some pretty good tunes. Theres no bad tracks on here, simply some shine and others are pretty solid. The biggest highlight of the album for me is 'I Can See For Miles', a big hit for plenty of Who fans. This is a great piece of songwriting with a dramatic opening, catchy harmonising chorus and a characteristic high pitched guitar strum over the top. Pete Townshend saw this as the album's best himself and released it as a single in the UK and amazingly it didn't do too well - you can see why Townshend subsequently quoted 'I spat on the British singles buyer!' 'Tattoo' is another great track, with a great beat and riff to it with plenty of meaningful lyrics. 'Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand' is another gem, with a lighthearted style to it and incorporates a fuzzy style at the end giving a clever shaking effect. John Enthwhistle's contributions such as 'Heinz Baked Beans' and 'Silas Stingy' live up to his quirky songwriting nature and are pretty good and Keith Moon was no songwriting slouch with his 'Girl's Eyes' song. The version of 'Hall of the Mountain King' is excellent which lots of wailing voices to the effect. Listen carefully to Rael - a great upbeat track that also has, towards the end, some of the guitar riffs that would characterise the'Tommy' rock opera. Other highlights include 'Jaguar', 'I Cant Reach You', 'Armenia City in the Sky' and 'Our Love Was'.<br /><br />The Who had a great idea with the radio theme and they've pulled it off extremely well with this album. The music on 'Sell Out' is excellent on the whole and most of all, it is a good laugh too. The Who knew how to entertain and this is a good example of their creative flare. The Who were to go onto masterpieces after this but never overlook this great effort which has the essence of later work. Any fan of the Who will love this album but even non-fans will appreciate and enjoy this. The Who are one of the greats - no question!ights include 'Jaguar', 'I Cant Reach You', 'Armenia City in the Sky' and 'Our Love Was'.

B00029NMRM|2.0|I will start off my review for this film with a little bit of support going for it, saying that Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry are two of my favorite actors. The bad part is that sadly, even though this film has a great cast, it happens to be one of those poor sequels with a great cast.<br /><br />This film picks up on where \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\" left off.  This time, Jimmy \\"The Tulip\\" Tedeski (Willis)is living in Mexico with his wife Jill (Amanda Peet).  Jimmy and Jill are both hitmen.  In the meantime, Oz (Perry) is living in Los Angeles with his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge).  Everything is going well for Jimmy and Jill, and everything is going, well, OK for Oz..........until Cynthia is kidnapped by the Hungarian mob that appeared in the first film (note that in the first film, Jill was Oz's assistant and Cynthia was originally Jimmy's wife), leaving Oz to turn to Jimmy and Jill for help, which leads to about an hour of boredom.<br /><br />When I first saw \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\", I thought it was hilarious, and I didn't understand why professional movie critics didn't like it (although it did make a lot of money and was very popular when it first came out).  Maybe the fact that the guy who directed the first film, Jonathan Lynn, was not involved behind the scenes with this film could have something to do with it (Director Howard Deutch substituted for Lynn on this film).  Maybe it just had bad timing. After all, this film was released shortly before the hit show \\"Friends\\" went off the air; maybe Matthew Perry was just too worried about what would happen to him and his career after his show went off the air.  It has often been said that nervousness can often result in a bad thing; maybe that's the case for Perry and this film (and maybe Willis if you heard the thing about him and Lindsey Lohan).  As I sit here typing this I am grateful for the fact that I am not a professional movie critic, and that I just do this for fun during my spare time. The performances in this film aren't that great, and like several critics already mentioned when this film came out, Amanda Peet didn't pull off much of a performance than Willis, Perry, and the other actors in this film did, but you can tell that she was TRYING to act.  And like I already said, Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry are two of my favorite actors, but in this film, they come off as very annoying.  I wanted to slap both Willis and Perry for their annoying performances in this film the first time I saw it.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a die hard movie fan who always like sequels no matter what the critics and movie buffs think, then this film is for you.  Otherwise, if you are not one of those people, then just skip this film and see \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\" instead.
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers (1971.), the Rolling Stones' twelfth studio album<br /><br />'Sticky Fingers' captures one of the greatest and most famous rock n' roll bands of all time on the top of their game. Stones fans aren't joking when they say the 1968-1974 period was the peak period for the Stones, 'Sticky Fingers' is concrete proof of this. The Rolling Stones line up had undergone some changes prior to this album, with the new recruitment of guitarist Mick Taylor who, in 1969 replaced original band founder Brian Jones, in part due to his drug condition which would tragically lead to his death in the same year. That aside, the Stones entered the 70's with a bang with this effort. Their sound changed slightly compared to previous works, with occasional incorporation of instruments such as the saxophone but they still had their classic sound to them, with that touch of the blues.<br /><br />Sticky Fingers is extremely versatile and has ballads, some slow and real bluesy tracks and plenty of good doses of good rock n' roll. The album has a clever fusion in many parts of acoustic and electric guitar styles which give the tracks plenty of effect. Mick Taylor was defintitely a great addition to the group, his guitar playing in the album is fantastic throughout and the fact he is considered one of the great blues guitarists is definitely justified. Lets not also forget Keith Richards too, whose playing also has great presence along with his mammoth contributions to the songwriting.<br /><br />Onto the album itself. From the opening riff of 'Brown Sugar', you know there is great stuff to come. 'Wild Horses' is a classic Stones ballad, with meaningful vocals, with a great acoustic style. 'Can't You Hear Me Knoncking; is a 7 minute masterpiece and is one of my favourites on the album. This track is so underrated - the guitar playing is first class - listen of for Mick Taylor jammin' out the track in style! 'You Gotta Move' is slower but it makes a good track - Mick Jagger with whoever was backing him on the vocals sound a bit spaced out at times on this track! Mick Jagger and co. had their drug addictions but it certainly did not affect their songwriting. 'Bitch' is a rocker with a killer riff throughout with brass playing here and there. 'I got the Blues' says it all in the title and Jagger gives a heartfelt performance on the vocals. 'Sister Morphine' is more thoughtful, copenned by Marianne Faithfull, has Jagger pleading on the vocals combined with some great guitar inputs. 'Moonlight Mile' is a fantastic track and is my personal favourite track on the album. Some brilliant blues style playing from Taylor highlight the track - the track is unusual but really grows on you after a few listens.<br /><br />Overall, an amazing effort from the Rolling Stones. This classic has ballads, plenty of political incorrectness and some fantastic songwriting. This is a great place to start if you want to begin to listen to the Stones (or the 40 licks CD compilation). A must for any fan of rock n' roll.vocals sound a bit spaced out at times on this track!

B00000APLB|5.0|The Stones always featured some great piano/keyboard work. In the early days Ian \\"Stew\\" Stewart played some great Otis Spann influenced Chicago blues. In addition Brian Jones, one of rock's most versatile instrumentalists, who played everything from flutes and harmonica to sitar and mirimba, as well as piano and organ. Then consider the great output of Nicky Hopkins aka \\"Edward\\" during the Begger's Banquet, Let It Bleed, and Exile recordings. Even today, when on tour, the band's in the more than capable hands of Chuck Leavall. That brings us to 1977's Love You Live. Who steps up to fill the slot, the inimitable, late great Billy Preston. Employing some brillant organ and soulful vocals, Billy spices up If You Can't Rock Me and Honky Tonk Woman. Nice job Billy!    But the real reason why I grab this CD and run out to my car for some good crusin' music is for the El Mocambo sides. Here we find the boys on familar turf; Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters and Ellis McDaniels, (shame on you if you didn't recognize Bo Diddly's real name). El Mocambo is surely the greatest recording capturing The Stones stripped down to the bone. Raw and unbridlled in a small Toronto Club, the band positively sizzles. For my money, they never sounded better!!!!!!!!!!!How can you not love 'em live!!!!!!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|i am so happy i was lucky enough to discover this album! i am very new to the type of brilliant music this album presents - But getting bored with the regular rock and r&B that i hear these days, i was desperate to find something different. If your one who wouldnt go for music like this, i strongly suggest you just try it out and you'll be suprised at how much you enjoy it! i only got this album very recently, and since then have got four other michael buble cd's!! the songs simply oozes sophisticated, amazing melodies, and vary from fun, upbeat latino tracks to relaxing, moving songs that will make you melt. The gorgeous Buble doesnt fail to impress. It's Time definitely shows off his wonderful vocal talent and he knows just how to make each classic hit his own. His singing voice is clearly influenced by Sinatra, Fitzgerald and many other great music legends and oozes charm, sex appeal and charisma. Every song is just remarkable in its own right.  <br />The highlight tracks, as hard as thay are to pick out, would probaly be You Don't Know Me, the way Buble sings this sweet number just melts me to the ground! Can't Buy Me Love, a brilliant, catchy, jazzy song i love it! The More I See You, again another fun and enjoyable track with a fabulous second half. How Sweet it is, i can't listen to this without tapping my feet or moving to the beat in some way! I seriously lose myself when i listen to Song For You and Under My Skin has all the appeal and attraction that Sinatras version has. All the tracks are truly breath-taking!! If for some stupid reason this album doesnt please or impress you, than you obviously dont have the abilty to recognise and appreciate true talent and real music!
B000002H33|5.0|I'm writing this review because I just got a bug up my kiester to do so. Right now I'm sitting here listening to Puppets, and I just had to write something. What else can be said about this album that hasn't already been said? This album just fu**ing rules! I was 16 years old when this album came out and I'm 33 now. It still sounds just as fresh and inspired as it did back then during my teenage days. If you are a metal fan and you don't have this album, then you are BASSACKWARDS. Anyway, gotta get back to playing more air guitar and air drums.

B000002U84|5.0|I was fortunate to interview Simon LeBon while DD was on the road in America for a tour of club dates after the surprise success of \\"Girls On Film\\" in US dance emporiums. He mentioned that he was thrilled to be in New York city and had been writing songs non-stop since the band had arrived. Those inspirations must have been the seeds for the songs that evolved into their second album, \\"Rio.\\" There is an amazing amount of youthful exuberance to be found throughout this disc's nine songs, and the band plays with confidence that belied \\"Rio's\\" sophomore album status.<br /><br />On this album, Duran Duran hit their stated ambition of mixing the do-it-yourself energy of punk with the dance grooves of Chic. DD's concept of punk may have been rooted more in Bowie and Roxy Music than the MC5, but they were the earliest to transcend the New Wave/New Romantic label and have massive pop hits. \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\" beat like nobody's business, undoubtedly helped by the orgasmic moans of an uncredited female. The video for that song  was embraced by MTV and \\"Rio\\" became a smash.<br /><br />Take away that hit, and the rest of \\"Rio\\" still comes away as imaginative, melodic and brash. The musicianship was greater than the sum of its parts, as each member locked in flawlessly with the others (and Nick Rhodes keyboards a standout), while Simon LeBon shoots for earnest passion and hits his mark, even when the lyrics are fluffy (\\"Hold Back The Rain\\"). The manic dual vocals of \\"New Religion\\" were also a highlight, something most bands wouldn't have the maturity to pull off on a second record.<br /><br />More than 20 years later, \\"Rio\\" maintains its vitality, better than many of the \\"important\\" bands of the period have. Rio maybe have been dancing across the sand, but for Duran Duran, this solid album was sugar sweet and remains their best work.
B0006399FS|1.0|How can you people seriously say this was a good piece of music? <br />u2 are talentless hacks and this is just another showcase for their inane attempts at music.

B000062XFG|4.0|This is pretty much where I started.  For some reason, I feel like I'm mostly familiar with Season 2 episodes from when I watched Star Trek back in college over ten years ago.  In my memory, a bunch of Season 2 episodes were at the apex of my \\"Star Trek\\" experience.  This tells you, of course, that I'm really not a Trekkie.  But now that we're watching episodes regularly (thanks to Netflix) we decided to start at this very season (because I do remember some highly cheesy Season 1 episodes as well, so we bypassed that one).<br /><br />Here's how I (a non-Trekkie) break down this season's episodes:<br /><br />CLASSICS:<br /><br />\\"The Measure Of A Man\\" - For a long time, my favorite TNG episode.  The courtroom dialogues is riveting, and the emotions are boiling over because the stakes are high.  Stewart, Frakes, and Spiner are at the top of their game here.  Don't miss it.<br /><br />\\"Q Who\\" - Ah, my favorite guest star/character.  Q introduces the crew to the Borg.  What a plot.  Picard's last trifecta - imploring Q to rescue them - is masterful.  Whoopi's Guinan is fantastic here.  She's so good you can forget her other roles.<br /><br />TOP NOTCH:<br /><br />\\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" - An interesting episode in that really probes Data's limits and introduces us to the character of Moriarty (who somehow becomes self-aware on the holodeck).  May sound hokey, but it's well done.<br /><br />\\"Unnatural Selection\\" - Actually quite tense.  I didn't see how they'd get out of the plot complications in this one.  Muldaur as Pulaski is quite good - I may even prefer her to Crusher.<br /><br />\\"A Matter Of Honor\\" - Intriguing watching.  Interesting exploration of culture clash and loyalty.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" - Tense.  It's worth your time.<br /><br />\\"The Royale\\" - I actually liked this one, although it has its detractors.  The basic idea of the Royale (I won't spoil it) is not much on its own, but I wondered how they'd get out of it.<br /><br />\\"Time Squared\\" - Very tense, especially as the future Picard they pick up gets closer to the present.  I generally don't like time travel issues, and this one is no exception, but there was enough creepiness (as well as good acting by Stewart) to keep me hooked.<br /><br />\\"Pen Pals\\" - If only for the Prime Directive discussion.<br /><br />\\"The Emissary\\" - Valuable Worf development.<br /><br />OK:<br /><br />(All the other episodes not listed above or below.  Most of these I could take or leave.)<br /><br />YUCK!:<br /><br />\\"The Child\\" - The whole premise - yuck!<br /><br />\\"Up The Long Ladder\\" - Give me a break.  The whole resolution to the problem is so contrived, it's vomit-inducing.  It's just yucky.  Skip it.<br /><br />Overall, a great season.  If I recall correctly (and the other reviews are right), it was this season which saw \\"Star Trek\\" starting to shed some of the holdover cheese and contrivances.  THAT is a good thing.n't like time travel issues, and this one is no exception, but there was enough creepiness (as well as good acting by Stewart) to keep me hooked.    \\"Pen Pals\\" - If only for the Prime Directive discussion.    \\"The Emissary\\" - Valuable Worf development.

B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" has got to be the most overrated album of all-time. It is painfully obvious to anyone with ears that Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" is a total and complete rip-off of Warrant's \\"Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich.\\" The riff from \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was stolen from \\"Down Boys.\\" \\"Lithium\\" is basically the same song as \\"Sometimes She Cries,\\" but with different pretentious lyrics. \\"In Bloom\\" is also a rip-off of \\"32 Pennies.\\" The list goes on and on. Almost song for song, Nirvana's \\"Masterpiece\\" is a total Warrant rip-off. <br /> <br />Kurt Cobain stole Jani Lane's persona/idenity. Kurt Cobain used to have dirty blond hair, but he dyed it blond so he could look like Jani. Cobain even tried (and failed) to imitate Jani Lane's signature vocals. All of Cobain's solos are a poor imitation of Joey Allen. <br /> <br />The truth of the matter is, in 1988, Sub Pop tried to sign Warrant, but Warrant refused and opted for Columbia. A few years later, Sub Pop signed Nirvana, under the condition that they remake \\"Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich\\" under a new title. The cloths may have been different, but the music was straight out of Warrant's song book. <br /> <br />Nirvana DID not define or represent generation x, Warrant did!!! It's a shame that all these trendy hipsters fell for it.  <br />
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I really liked this cd.  I received it as a gift before I had ever seen the movie and I just loved the upbeat nature of it.  I was a little tired of Lady Marmalade because of all of the airplay it received on the radio but there are plenty of other songs that compensated for that.  I love all the old songs done by new artists like Valeria's version of DeBarge's 1980's hit \\"Rhythm of the Night\\" as well as a few others.  One of my favorites is track 3 by Fatboy Slim : I think it's an excellent song to wake up to in the morning - it will certainly get you moving that is for sure! I also really enjoyed the vocal stylings of Ms. Kidman and Mr. McGregor.  They surprised me quite a bit. \\"Come what May\\" is a beautiful song as is the French ditty \\"Complainte De La Butte\\" by Rufus Wainwright (no clue what it means but it sounds pretty - like a lullabye). Worth purchasing if you have eclectic taste in music....
B000002C1W|4.0|The departure of Roger Waters did affect the quality of Pink Floyd's music.  However, this music still sounds Floydish and it is still worthy of the Pink Floyd name.  We could all wish for Roger Waters to still be with the group, but sometimes you have to take what you can get.  I would rather have a slightly weaker Pink Floyd album than no Pink Floyd at all.  Even though the album may have been less great than some previous albums, there are still several excellent songs, \\"Learning to Fly,\\" \\"On the Turning Away,\\" and \\"Dogs of War.\\"<br /><br />Every Pink Floyd should have at least one instrumental, and those instrumentals should have progressive elements.  \\"Signs of Life\\" meets those requirements.  There are sound effects, a voice that is mostly unintelligible, and enough music that the instrumental is intriguing.  Welcome to \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\\" says this introduction.<br /><br />The second track on this CD is one of the best.  Sounding much like classic Floyd, \\"Learning to Fly\\" has the dark essence of the moodiest Pink Floyd sound with intricately fashioned music and emotionally sung words.  The pealing guitars and punctuated percussion are all hallmarks of Floyd as we have known them.  While this excellent song breaks no new ground, it is familiar and enjoyable.<br /><br />In retrospect, \\"The Dogs of War\\" was almost too late.  This song is about the Cold War, which effectively ended when the Berlin Wall fell.  Still, there remain threats in the world today and those threats have the potential to destroy this world, so there remains relevance to this song.  Stylistically the song remains very similar to what Pink Floyd has done in the past.<br /><br />I am reluctant to call \\"One Slip\\" filler.  The lyrics are a philosophical exploration of what happens when someone succumbs to their feelings for another, and that other person simultaneously succumbs.  I really enjoy the interesting lyrics, which are generally well written with but a couple of bumpy spots.  The music is another matter; too mellow, too little challenge.  In the Pink Floyd catalog the music of this song is near the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Another of the excellent songs on this CD is \\"On the Turning Away.\\"  The lyrics are about the wealthy avoiding societal issues, most especially poverty and medical care.  This song has generally straightforward lyrics matched with excellent music.  The vocals are nicely layered and soaring, and sufficiently bombastic to make this song enjoyable for progressive rock fans.  The guitars are dominant in several places in several styles, all interesting to hear.<br /><br />\\"Yet another Movie\\" is an average song.  The lyrics are reasonably good, but the music is too bland until the bridge, which finally shakes things up.  This song is progressive long at about seven and a half minutes, but has little to commend it as a true progressive rock song.  The beginning is ominous and foreboding, but is slightly out of context with the words, unless you expand the scope of the words to include any dramatic movie.<br /><br />The next three tracks form a trilogy, with the instrumental \\"Terminal Frost\\" sandwiched between the songs \\"A New Machine Part 1\\" and \\"A New Machine Part 2.\\"  The introductory song has an electronically modified vocal singing the words, which form the introduction to the instrumental.  Listening to this music casually I was struck by the similarity of portions of this music to Toto's music for the 1984 movie \\"Dune.\\"  This instrumental is nicely constructed with multiple elements and changes in tempo and style that makes this track interesting to hear.  The music is generally mellow with accents that keep your ear interested.  This track is musically least connected with the historical Pink Floyd style, though it David Gilmour proves he can craft good music with this track.  \\"A New Machine Part 2\\" ties up the trio, again with electronically altered vocals.  The vocals are simple, but provide an effective coda.<br /><br />The final song is almost nine minutes long.  \\"Sorrow\\" opens with crunchy guitars chords, leading into an elegantly crafted song as complex as a progressive rock song can be.  The words are wonderful as they may be interpreted in multiple ways.  I like to consider these words in view of a fantasy, a kingdom lost, perhaps from the point of view from one who knew the kingdom in its greatness, and now sees only decay.  This song would do well as a theme song for portions of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, as I can imagine Roland Deschain feeling in this way for Gilead.<br /><br />Few groups survive for very long, typically because the members have difficulty maintaining continuity of vision for more than a few years.  Pink Floyd survived the loss of founder Syd Barrett, and then survived the loss of Roger Waters.  Both losses hurt, but the group went on.  The music on this CD remains true to the vision of Pink Floyd.  The principal loss I see is that the group seemed to remain musically stagnant, or formulaic, after the departure of Roger Waters.  However, if you like the Pink Floyd sound, the post-Waters CDs are respectable.  Pink Floyd at its weakest is better than 95% of other groups.  I keep seeing the term \\"dinosaur\\" in reference to Pink Floyd.  Dinosaurs they may be, but they are gloriously talented dinosaurs nonetheless.effective coda. <br /> <br />The final song is almost nine minutes long.  \\"Sorrow\\" opens with crunchy guitars chords, leading into an elegantly crafted song as complex as a progressive rock song can be.

B000075BFK|5.0|I heard this album when I was 13 years old.  It was the second time I ever heard of Tupac, and since I was only a little kid when he died in 96, I didn't know much about him.  This is my favorite album because it reaches all feelings and emotions, touches all of the senses.  It speaks of expressing anger in songs like \\"When We Ride On Our Enemies\\" and \\"Street Fame\\". It shows signs of hope in the hood with songs like \\"My Block\\", \\"Thugz Mansion\\", and \\"Better Dayz\\".  Still, it expresses the great beats and party lyrics of Tupac with songs like \\"Still Ballin\\", \\"Fair Xchange\\", and \\"Watcha Gonna Do\\".  Great album for a dead guy.
B000002BQK|5.0|This was her first album released after her separation from Tommy Mottola, and arguably her greatest album ever released. Mariah is one of the most gifted and talented singers of all time, and the songs on this album display her strong vocals wonderfully. Beyond that, her songs are just beautifully written.<br /><br />The Voice is definitely still there, but due to her newly found freedom (in her separation from Mottola), Mariah's style changes a bit. She expresses more emotion in her singing and in her lyrics, showing a side to her that we hadn't seen before. She sings of freedom and personal matters, making her album even stronger than those released before Butterfly.<br /><br />Butterfly, Close My Eyes and Outside are all some of her greatest ballads, with very deep, personal lyrics that really anyone can find meaning in. Besides that, she has a range of great R&B and dance mixes. To fully appreciate Mariah Carey's genuis, you must listen to this album. Words can't even describe how amazing it is... just buy it.
B000002TQV|5.0|Like fine wine, this album gets better with time.  Guitar licks to die for, great lyrics, and the true beginning of the best band of this generation.
B000002LR3|5.0|This cd is what movie goers would call a \\"cult classic\\". The music on it is so diverse that from one song to next doesn't even sound like the same cd, more like a compilation album with various artists. I too was introduced to Primal Scream through the Cindy Crawford workout video. I loved the music so much I found myself watching the video over and over just to hear the music. I was very dedicated to working out everyday for a year cuz of the music. When I saw the end credits I was shocked to find out that 90 percent of the music she used was infact by one band ... Primal Scream. So during driver's ed my class drove to the mall for a break. I hunted down Screamadelica and listened to it on the way back home by the end of the drive my classmates were also interested in it. I have Cindy Crawford to thank for my discovery. \\"Higher Than the Sun\\" ,\\"Loaded\\", \\"Don't Fight It Feel It\\" (the ultimate tummy crunch song, perfect title too) LOL and my personal favorite \\"Slip Inside This House\\" ...easilly one of my favorite songs of all time. Trip-hop, house, dance, whatever you wanna call it... I call it great! A classic in it's own right and definately underrated. Buy this album no matter what your into, it is a psychedelic trip into the 90's.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Everything that can be said about this album has been.  It has been one of my favorites for 6 years now.   <br /> <br />Keep up the good work boys.
0156027321|3.0|I read this book based on a recommendation from two co-workers who said they \\"couldn't put it down.\\" It is a page turner because you really do want to find out what is going to happen to this little Indian boy and this tiger stranded in the Pacific... but I can't say it was a great or even a good book. I would call it very average with a thought-provoking ending.<br /><br />The twist at the end to be honest had me thinking back to my college days when I read Silas Marner in an English lit class. That book by George Eliot had a very surprising ending that made me so glad I read it. Like Silas Marner, the ending of Life of Pi made me glad that I finished it.<br /><br />Martel creates a believable story and then rips that story from underneath you. He makes you see clearly why this boy has chosen to suspend reality. It also is a good indicator of how we all suspend our own realities at times, which I think is the sign of a good book when it can show you parallels in your own life.<br /><br />That being said, I read the book very quickly not only because I wanted to find out what happened but also because I just wanted the whole thing to get over. I read a lot of political books and biographies, so this was a very different read for me and I just didn't find myself enjoying it that much. It was more of a mission to get to the end and find out what happened.<br /><br />I'm not saying you won't enjoy the journey, but to be honest I enjoyed the destination way more than the journey.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead didn't want to save rock and roll, they just did it.  This album changed the direction rock was going.  People keep saying this album doesn't work as a rock album.  Not true.  Anyone that has seen Radiohead in concert knows how well all of these tracks work as Arena Rock.   <br /> <br />I find this to be the equal of the Bends and OKComputer.  All three albums are totally different, yet totally transformative.  Let Kid A take you on a ride.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow.  That's really all I can say.  This is one of the greatest shows of all time and it is so sad that it was cancelled so early in its run.  For everyone who is contemplating buying this DVD, you definitely should buy it.  I am so glad I did.<br /><br />It is such a perfect combination of action, drama, humor and production value, I really think it could be close to a perfect television show.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Perfect blend of old school Radiohead and the newer sound.  If you want another OKComputer, look elsewhere.  If you want some innovative, catchy, dense, kick-ass grooves then you have some to the right place.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Well, it would appear that 99% of us here agree that is one of the best Priest albums to have been released since their inception. Ignore the fruitcake that posted a bad review, he simply missed the whole concept. This album has all of the glorious things we have come to hope for from not only a Priest release, but all metal. There are the great driving tunes, power tracks & a lovely ballad. What's more, this is Rob at his vocal best, along with some fantastic guitar playing, Priest is firing on all cylinders baby!
B00006HYQ5|4.0|Although ackward in the beginning, once you try you won't want another mouse. I initially took one for my laptop and for travel but I eded up using it at home. I like the lided red wheel, the lightness and the small size of this comfortable mouse - also very precise and sharp. I'd give it 5 stars but I prefer 4 stars because it is not as quiet as I wished it would be. Also I give it a plus for the soft touch - it is covered with a special material.
B000060P79|1.0|If you're fans are 90% females and teeny boppers, you're music isn't that good. It just means that you have a lot of groupies and little kids, who feel sorry for their selves just as much as you do, listening to you...... <br /> <br />Don't be fooled!
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi Hendrix was always one of the most (if not) gifted guitarist of his generation.   But before his went on to write defining songs such as \\"Crosstown Traffic\\", \\"Purple Haze\\", \\"Hey Joe\\", \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\", he was almost on the verge of become an international star, and although there were a great many ideas, as to what direction to take his music into, they needed to be shepherded into some kind of order.  his album would find Jimi in far more experimentive form, than his later albums, almost willing to play with a great many forms of electrified guitar genres, before becoming more focused on later work. <br /> <br />On this album, Jimi shows himself to capable of creating gently textured songs, that are more more quietly melody based than his later work, with almost gentle pastoral songs, and wirlling psychedelic-soul of \\"Up from the Skies\\", occupying a floating ambience, not usually associated with his work.  \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" moves closer to Epic multi-layered, crunching guitars (similar to \\"Crosstown Traffics\\") of something like 'Led Zep', but embued with a slightly surrealistic edge, that Jimi was to go on to be known for.  \\"Wait until Tomorrow\\", bears witness to some incredibly solid rhythm and blues, that uses the otherworldly dynamic of this album, to really show his growing confident mastery of both studio & instrument.  \\"Ain't No Telling\\" dips its toes into compelling jam heavy electrified-Blues, immediately showing Jimi's eagerness to covers as many cosmic spectrum of sounds, as possible, it's amped up extraterrestrial blues, brought into sharp focus with rhythmic drumming confidently riding alongside, the passionate riffing.   <br /> <br />\\"Little Wing\\", is the musical equivalent of psychedelic stoner-rock, done through the eyes of a exceptionally talented guitarist, who bring his inventiveness to bear on such intensely fluid material.  Remarkably the journeys into other forms of electrified guitar music, even extend as far as Psychedelic-Funk (P-Funk), with the fuzzed-out, grooveadelic riffs and rambunctious free-wheeling sounds, that sound (instrumentally-wise) not a little unlike 'One Nation under a Groove' era \\"Funkadelic\\", that 3/4 of the way into this track morphs into a freeform Rock Wig-out, with dramatic/Carefree ambitions.  \\"You Got Me Floatin\\", is a taut, and bullish number, with the use of the  wah-wah pedal, propelling the track onto some form of earthly axis, delving into extravagant and indulgent impulses of guitar work, working together into a technically staggeringly expansive body of work, that edges nearer to progressive-rock, even thought it a short track at 2 minutes 45 seconds.  \\"Castles made of Sand\\" is arguably the most well-known track on here, and deservedly so, with a fine line in ambient rock, with light guitar plucking and a surprisingly complex mix of avant-garde jazz sensibilities, classical minimalism, ambient and space music, this is arguably Hendrix at his most restrained and remains a exquisite piece of music, constructed with more thought and emotion, than almost anything he would later go onto the create....in fact this form of gentlee music would be revisited in \\"Electric Ladyland's\\", exceptional avant-garde ambient  track: \\"1983...(A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\\".  Changing tack slightly is the is the Hi-energy chorus led Blues-rock of \\"She's so Fine\\", (which was penned by Noel Redding), is beautifully high octane and overflowing with creative energy, that merely serves to highlight Jimi's outstanding use of rhythm and space.   <br /> <br />\\"One Rainy Wish\\", marks a shift into subtle rhythm & Blues, pulling together into a almost fractious battle between quiet/loud dynamics, as sections of the relatively uplifting melodies, are occasionally interrupted by bursts of riff-heavy rock, coming through the sound.   \\"Little Miss Lover\\" uses layers of ultra-groovy, hard-edged Funk with fancy lead guitar riffs so confidently, that had Hendrix decided to go musically,down the path of \\"Funk\\" music, he would have most likely been one of it's most revered artists., such is the complexity and skill displayed here.  Album closer \\"Bold as Love\\", remains a remarkable track to bow out the album on, with it's Blues-Rock emphasising, the traditional, three-chord blues song and instrumental improvisation, but filtering the sound with a psychedelic edge mixed with loud amplification from rock & roll, it, yet the Ballad-esque approach works wonderfully within the context of the track, and possibly one of the most sincere moments on the album. <br /> <br />Few would argue that this is a truly stunning album and worthy of 5 Stars, and this also finds Hendrix arguably working in some of his most experimental set of  songs, and the whole album is something of a textural masterpiece, shifting from psychedelic experimentalism one minute, to a mood that is in parts calm fragments and reflective dissonance, introspective looking and yet remarkably calming and serene, but then shifting tack again and then sounding tightly wound and monstrous epic via way of being almost, thunderously loud.  Those that are looking to start building a Jimi Hendrix collection (like me), and aren't content to settle with just a 'Best of' album....should be (slightly) warned, because as remarkable as this album is, it has to be strongly recommended that you start with \\"Electric Ladyland\\" & \\"Are you Experienced?\\", as the first two choices to begin with.  As they best encapsulate what Hendrix's music eventually evolved into. Once you have those albums and indeed are curious for more of his work, you'll be hard pressed to find fault with the early experimentation & creative identity expressed here (if you listen closely a couple of songs/ideas/riffs, get reworked/reinterpreted into later albums), this exceptional album is Hendrix at probably his most personal.
B00063MBU8|1.0|People know that these guys aren't punk and that's not the only reason that they get bashed on the internet or anywhere else for that matter. The thing is, these poppy so called PUNK sell-outs stole the bad boy punk image and took it to the mainstream leaving the punk roots behind. So, if you're a fan of these guys or any other pop singing wussies, please understand why we're so upset........I give this album one star for them trying to look punk, but not actually representing it.....
B00004Y6NP|5.0|In their native britian they were often dismissed as too safe of a rock band.  This band is mellow and not about image at all, unlike most bands of the time.  The cd is extremely well mastered and the songs are laden with mild synth atmospherics.  Almost every song on here is a major hit, and represents the best of their repertoire (the only really famous song they made that is not on here is \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" a song from their self-titled debut album that is recommended in addition to this one)  I personally liked every single song on here, except \\"why worry\\" because the lyrics seemed pretty dumb in the delivery.  I have always liked trumpets and saxophones, and so one of my favorite songs is \\"your latest trick\\" with a trumpet line that is to die for.  There is rocking out on a few songs and mellowness on a few songs to provide a good classic mix of songs.  You should check it out if this kind of music suits your interests.

B00005K9LN|5.0|While not quite as strong from beginning to end as Hell Bent for Leather, British Steel still produced two of the most recognized and well-loved metal songs of all-time.<br /><br />\\"Living after Midnight\\" while perhaps a bit on the \\"pop\\" side remains one of the great metal anthem songs.  With it's distinctive opening drum beat by new drummer Dave Holland, this is a tune that remains on the play lists of many rock stations 25 years after its debut.  A certified classic.<br /><br />\\"Breaking the Law\\"  as distintive as \\"Living after Midnight\\" is with its opening drums, so is this song with the opening guitar riff making this another certified classic.  The song has gone on to be featured in several films and while it had one of the cheesiest videos ever, the song remains a fave.<br /><br />\\"Rapid Fire\\"  A speed metal song before anyone ever heard of the term.  A pounding \\"rapid fire\\" pace of a song that always made for a great opening song and a head banging legend.<br /><br />\\"Grinder' a great opening guitar riff of a song that in many ways reflects the essence of heavy metal.  Fantastic solo!<br /><br />Those are my four favorites from the album.  \\"Steeler' and \\"The Rage are also good.  I was never much of a fan of \\"Metal Gods\\" though.  A powerful album that cemented Priest as the premiere and most revered Heavy Metal band of the early 1980's.
B00003CX8V|5.0|I've seen thousands of films, but have managed to miss some of the great ones.  This was the case with \\"The Apartment\\" until recently.  It won the 1960 Best Picture Oscar, and the reasons are evident even 45 years later. <br /> <br />Jack Lemmon stars as C.C. Baxter, recently arrived in NYC from Cincinnati, a faceless insurance company drone trying to make his mark.  He's got a hook; he loans his apartment to his superiors and their mistresses.  This leads to some very funny moments as he often regrets allowing himself to be used like this, and has good reason to look down his nose at these middle-aged adolescents and their Clintonesque hijinx. <br /> <br />Fred MacMurray costars as the head of personnel, who's become aware of Baxter thanks to the recommendations of promotion given him by said middle-aged adolescents.  He smells a rat, and calls Baxter on the carpet for a very enlightening and confidential conversation.  There's more than one rat, and more than a few middle-aged adolescents here, including those who won't spell it out. <br /> <br />Shirley MacLaine costars as Fran, a pretty, young elevator operator with no apparent social life.  The guys are all intrigued, especially Mr. Baxter.  But \\"no apparent social life\\" does not equal \\"NO social life.\\"  And thereby hangs the tale. <br /> <br />Writer/producer/director Billy Wilder had been successful in Hollywood for over two decades before this 1960 hit, having come to the US from Berlin when Hitler came to power in the early '30s when many European Jews wisely fled for freer pastures.  He's at his very best here, with the laughs in the early part of the film being delivered with a jaded but not totally jaundiced eye, and the drama and true romance later in the film being delivered first with a few literal hard slaps in the face but then with a light but never schmaltzy hand. <br /> <br />The film is over two hours, and not a wasted moment.  Every performance seems totally natural.  It's also a joy to see somany antique appliances functioning as they were created to; the ancient stoves and ovens, the record player, the '50s TV set, the telepones with dials instead of push buttons, the elevator operators and even their ground floor coordinator!  It isn't self-conscious or self-congratulatory about any of these things or the characters who use them, either, so in 2005 it plays more like a period piece and not an outdated relic. <br /> <br />\\"The Apartment\\" has my highest recommendation for anyone who hasn't seen it.  You owe it to yourself to see this classic, although the American Film Institute really slights it by ranking it only #93 on their top 100 American films of all time.  (\\"Giant\\" outranks this?  Puh-leeze.....)
B00005K9LK|5.0|While Priest would still put out some great songs in the years following \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\", this would really be their last GREAT record and featured them at the height of their power and reflected their personality in its purest form.<br /><br />\\"Another thing Coming\\" has gone on to become probably one of the top 10 heavy metal songs.  Halford is so potent on this song that his status as one of the all time great leads is full warranted.  The powerful guitar riffs and solos highlight a song that hooks you at the first few notes and never lets you go.  A legendary tune!<br /><br />\\"Electric Eye\\"  one of my all-time favorite Priest songs...starting out slow and then takes off on a break-neck pace with Rob at his most shrill.  A not only great song but one incredibly prophetic today.  This one takes me back to 1983 when a local band I used to work for opened thier shows with this one.  Brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Screaming for Vengeance' Wow, what an appropriate title as screaming in his distinctive style is exactly what Rob Halford does in this powerful, jolting song of vengeance.  Another certifiable classic.<br /><br />\\"pain and Pleasure\\" Powerful bass and a pounding drumbeat highlight this slower-paced yet catchy tune.  Even when Priest slowed it down they were still more powerful than any other band.<br /><br />This whole album really takes me back to Metals dawning era of 1983 when Priest was in their prime, and bands such as Motly Crue, Ratt, and Metallica were just starting to make a name for themselves.  It was a wonderful era for metal heads!
B00062ZE3U|5.0|I just have to make it clear that this album has some of the best production quality I have ever heard, and in no way is this force silent.  So, here we are, the band's third full-length album.  What's new to expect?  Quite a bit.   <br /> <br />First, I should mention the drastic line-up change.  I'm not sure if this in any way affected the songwriting, but David Martijn Westerholt, Ivar de Graaf and Michiel Papenhoeve have indeed been replaced by Ruud Jolie (not related to Angelina), Stephen van Haestregt and Martijn Spierenburg.  Also, the band are now on the BMG label, giving them access to a wider market (meaning better sales) throughout Europe.  Stylistically, the Silent Force is very different than previous outings.  It's hard to believe that this is the same band who released the gloomy Enter back in 1997, or even 2000's Mother Earth.  The band have traded in the more energetic sound for a laid-back, calmer feel - mainly indicative through Sharon den Adel's softer vocals, which resemble more Celine Dion than Kate Bush, and also the more rhythmic verses.   <br /> <br />Many critics have deemed this album a commercial attempt - and to some extent, this is true.  \\"Stand My Ground\\" is a very radio-friendly song, and is probably my least favorite by them, as it sounds way too much like an Evanescence single.  Also, \\"A Dangerous Mind\\" (found exclusively on the digipak edition) sounds very pop-inspired.  These are probably where this new direction impacts the album most - and 2 out of 13 isn't bad.  The strength of tracks like \\"Jillian\\" and \\"Memories\\" - by far two of Within Temptation's most beautiful and deep songs - make up for this tremendously, offering emotions not capable of being reached on Mother Earth.   <br /> <br />But, the main question I keep hearing, is WT still a metal band?  I would say yes and no.  If metal to you exclusively means Sepultura or In Flames, then it's a no.  However, if you appreciate heaviness integrated with the tender beauty of genres like new age - then this album is sure to please.  Don't expect an Enter or a Mother Earth - I think that's without mention.  Although I think those two as a whole are better than the Silent Force, I've learned that sometimes the parts are more significant than the whole itself.  <br /> <br />9.7/10
0064407667|4.0|This book is the beginning of what has become a very successful series of books for children and young adults.  I have read several of the books in the series and this is as good as it gets.  The story starts out with the three siblings being orphaned after their parents are killed in an ugly house fire.  The story continues with the siblings finding a new home and evading a villainous man who is after their fortune left to them by their late parents.<br /><br />The book is interesting and the fast moving plot leaves you on the edge of your seat.  I would suggest that you read this book, but then not read any of the other books in the series since the quality of the books content greatly declines after the first book.
B00079018K|5.0|This is a great album. Music is highly original and unlike anything i've ever heard. That is meant as a compliment! As far as the copy protection goes, I have an Apple iMac running iTunes. It ripped all the tracks just fine. The copy scheme is probably aimed at people using Windows computers. As far as I know, Apple computers are immune to it. Maybe another reason for people to buy Apple computers. Anyway, I sympathize with everyone on copy protecting CDs. If you buy the CD, you have a right to copy it and rip it to mp3, aac, etc. and transfer the music to your portable device. Blame the music industry for the high prices of the CDs and also the pirates who get the music illegally. Don't punish the artists for it; it's not their fault. Write to the music labels via email or regular mail and make yourselves be heard. Please rate the CD based on its music, not the copy protection. Thank you.

B000002MP2|5.0|I may be a new fan of Green Day but It doesn't take more than one song to get me hooked. After borrowing Green Day's soap oprea like rock ballad \\"American Idiot\\" from a friend, I found out that \\"Green Day\\" was not another fake rock band. I regret to admit that I could've listened to green Day long before now. Three days ago, at the local Walmart I bought Dookie, hoping for the same sound  and punk-rock genius that made American Idiot a winner. I got a pleasant surprise with Dookie. It did not have the same amount of hard rock as American Idiot. This album has a very high-school immature goof-off feeling. I just couldn't do anything but smile. Green Day has a feeling in their music that makes any depressing or sadistic situation into a time when you just want to smile or do the air-guitar. The one problem I did have with this album  is I found it a tad bit short. Heres a track by track description of the album. <br /> <br />1.)Burnout: a fast catchy song about a burnout after smoking, has a very cool guitar riff. 4.5 out of 5 <br />  <br />2.)Having A Blast: A song about a suicide bomber.Although it deals with a very seruious and violent topic, Green Day still makes this song awesome with its extremely catchy lyrics and punk-rock sound. 4.5 out of 5 <br /> <br />3.)Chump: one of my favorite songs on the album with an awesome two chord guitar riff at the end of the song. A very catchy song about hatng someone you don't know perfectly emphasizea on the feeling of defiance that is always present in \\"Green Day's\\" songs. 5 out of 5 <br /> <br />4.)Longview: A song about laziness and being bored. One of the singles for the album. It is very catchy and sometimes true for me. There is great bass in this song. This is one of my favorite songs on the album. 5 out of 5 <br />  <br />5.)Welcome to Paradise: A song about going to paradise. My favorite song on the album, I love the lyrics! You get a great Bass solo at the end. One of the singles. 500 out of 5 <br /> <br />6.)Pulling Teeth: A song about a girlfriend. This song really grew on me after a few listens. Another very catchy song. One of my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />7.)Basket Case: One of the singles. A song about a mental institute. Excellent guitar, great lyrics and easy to sing along with. Another one of my favorites 5 0ut of 5 <br /> <br />This review will be continued with Amatuer Punk or Mature masterpiece part 2
0553266306|4.0|This book was excellent because it was different. It was extremely directed and purposeful, it was written in the cold calculated style of an assassin's mind.<br /><br />However, portions of the book were too long and sprawling. Some of the details were approaching laborious. The book felt a bit bloated by unwanted information.<br /><br />This book is clearly excellent and worth recommending to friends. But talks of being 'the best ever' are overreaching
B00005JNTV|4.0|Frank Miller, the lord of graphic comic novels, has been given his just due in a sumptuously stylized film version of his Sin City.  Lovingly brought to the screen by Robert Rodriguez with an assist by buddy Quentin Tarantino, this tale of vengeance and lust in a dark metropolis is unlike any movie in recent years in terms of consistent technique and visuals serving a group of interconnected stories in which the outcasts of civilization engage in urban survival while attempting to maintain a sense of honor and love.  It is also an extremely violent film. <br />  <br />On a dark, rainy night, three major stories parallel each other.  The first story has Detective John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) search for a missing girl before a serial killer strikes again. With his unsavory partner, Bob (Michael Madsen), he finally tracks down the killer in a bang-up finish, or is it?    A separate story has a brutish exconvict, Marv (Mickey Rourke), who seeks revenge for the murder of a hooker.  He is befriended by a parole officer, Lucille (Carla Gugino), a waitress, Shellie (Britanny Murphy), a stripper, Nancy (Jessica Alba), and a hooker, Gail (Rosario Dawson).  His search for the killer pulls him into a grisly world of murder led by psychopaths, dirty cops, and corrupt, political leaders.  Another story has a loner, Dwight (Clive Owen), protect his waitress girlfriend from a gang led by Jack (Benicio Del Toro) and a mob boss, Manute (Michael Clark Duncan).  Things come full circle once events unfold, and surprises are unveiled with seemingly unrelated events and characters linked together. <br />  <br />To say more would spoil a smorgasbord of film noir and stylized action.  There are some clever plot twists and surprises along the way.  People's loyalties are constantly in question, and the three male leads are surrogate avengers for justice, redemption and salvation. The film's structure is reminiscent of Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction and even P. T. Anderson's Magnolia where various people meet in a series of vignettes and affect others who are seemingly unconnected.  There are moments that seem influenced by past films.  Certainly Sam Raimi's (Spiderman) earlier Darkman was a direct precursor to Sin City.  There is a scene with Clive Owen driving with a corpse that is a sort of homage to the 1945 horror classic The Body Snatchers.  Rutger Hauer plays a religious leader in a scene not unlike the scene in Blade Runner where ironically Hauer reversed roles as an assassin in that film.  A marvelous action piece with a female samurai warrior has all the earmarks of Tarantino who picks up where Kill Bill left off. <br />  <br />It is fascinating to watch what is essentially a pre-storyboarded film with the graphic novel serving as a blueprint for the film.  `Shot and cut' by Rodriguez himself, the film feels very consistent with a true auteur's vision.  Frank Miller imagined it, and Rodriguez made it happen.  This is Rodriguez' most assured film thus far, and it is a living, breathing comic book in the best sense.  Despite the wide commercial appeal of successful comic adaptations of Spiderman and X-Men, Sin City is perhaps the most authentic and uncompromising transfer of such material.  Much of what is depicted onscreen is predominantly a fabrication of computer generated special effects and trendsetting photography within which the actors interact.  The black and white photography is at times gorgeous and downright nightmarish with the strategically accented color schemes similar to the best shots in Pleasantville and Schindler's List.  There is no doubt that the visuals of this film have been achieved with painstaking detail and success.   <br />  <br />A dream cast features a wealth of actors and actresses, any two of whom could have front lined separate features on their own.  Willis and Owen are quite effective as heroic, yet flawed personas, but it is Mickey Rourke who is a standout in what amounts to a comeback film.  Even under his Frankenstein-like makeup, his humanity and toughness shine through.  He makes the most of a potentially ridiculous role.  In addition, while the males are mostly rugged, disheveled hulks, the females are beautiful and extremely sexy (sleazy?) to say the least.  Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, and Carla Gugino, (sorely missed from her brief Karen Sisko tv series) sizzle on the screen as they crossover different storylines.  The performances are all fairly convincing once you excuse the occasional, awkward voice over narration.   <br />   <br />Some things are left hanging plot wise.  Many characters are almost caricatures; we have to accept them at face value without much depth.  We never fully understand the psychopathic monster that is played by Elijah Wood.  Where did he come from and why is he purely evil?  Likewise, a partnership, betrayal, and reconciliation at the beginning of the film are never fully explored.  The dialogue is a bit Jekyll and Hyde with some hokey lines followed by a series of sharp, humorous ones.   <br />  <br />This is a film superficially filled with nudity, explicit language, taboo subject matter, and buckets of bloody violence.  This is going to be offensive to many people who are put off by intense scenes of mayhem, but to those who thrive on the film noir of adult comic books, it is a dream come true.   <br />  <br />If this adaptation is a one shot deal, the filmmakers gave it their best efforts.  It is entirely plausible to have a sequel with an entirely different cast (even though a number of the principles survive this entry.)  This movie is a splendid exercise in look and mood with emotional substance, no mean feat.  It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who are game, just hang on and enjoy the ride.  Ironically, although Sin City is a graphic film in every sense of the word, this tale of haunted characters in an amoral world is ultimately a moral film. <br />  <br /> <br />
B000002MP2|5.0|Green day are todays biggest sellouts, but back in the day, they were genius. Yes, this one was a huge hit, but the cd is so clever, and they had not changed there sound much since kerplunk that they were not sellouts. This nintys greenday was genius, and deserves unlimate respect. 94 was a great year for ninties revival. Rancid lets go!, nofx punk in drublic, offspring smash, and green day dookie all came out the same year. that is one kick ass year. This is what i think of the songs on dookie:<br /><br />burnout-10/10-this one is a classic, fast, and fun.<br /><br />having a blast-10/10-really funny, another classic.<br /><br />chump-8/10-this one has too many instrumentals. still rocks<br /><br />longview-10/10-yes, it got to famous, but a hilarious green day classic<br /><br />Welcome to paridise-10/10-a bit better that the kerplunk version. One of greenday's best ever.<br /><br />Pulling teeth-9.5/10-Hilarious. Friggin hilarious.<br /><br />Basketcase-10/10-the most classic of green day classics. one of the greatest songs ever written.<br /><br />she-10/10-Another classic. Great lyrics.<br /><br />sassfras roots-8/10-my least favorite on the cd, because lyrics are repetitive. But it is really funny.<br /><br />when i come aroun-10/10-this one got alot of attention too, but another classic.<br /><br />Coming clean-9/10-It would be a classic, but its too short. Short but sweet.<br /><br />Enemius Sleepus-10/10-mike dirnt wrote this song, and it totally rules.<br /><br />In the end-10/10-An awsome classic. The chorus kicks. One of my favorits.<br /><br />F.O.D.-10/10-Classic. Followed by a hilarious secret track.<br /><br />As you can see by the high marks on everythink, this record kicks ass.

B0007DAZW8|3.0|With Human After All, Daft Punk reveals an irony, that its music is now devoid of emotions and personality. Make no mistake, Human After All is still a fine piece of electronic goodness but don't think of Discovery.<br /><br />Human After All is a little cold, perhaps decidedly so. Some tracks like Robot Rock and Steam Machine seem to be one long extended track. Daft Punk borrows a bit more than usual from rock music this time round than in previous cases. The fusion of rock and dance works at times but falters in parts too.<br /><br />However, all is not lost. There's still the very stellar Prime Time Of Your Time, Make Love, Brainwasher and Technologic. The closer, Emotion, does finally evict the coldness to bring some humanity to the album. Six weeks might have been a case of laziness covering for a 4-year hiatus but the masters at work still manage to scrape through, just barely.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Okay i'm gonna get this out of the way right now, stop expecting another songs for the deaf. all you people are saying it's not as good as sftd because it's missing it's all star ensemble of musicians....f*** that concept. The queens of the stone age try to be different on each album and one way they do that is by constantly changing their line from album to album, check all the albums out each have similarities and differences. Now i was skeptic at first because of the departure of NIck oliveri, but when Nick left kyuss did josh stop rocking so hard, f*** no he rocked harder and that's what happened in the queens of the stone age. Lullabies to paralyze is a very good album i give it closer to 4 and 3/4 stars the highlight songs to me are probably, \\"medication\\" \\"tangled up in plain\\" \\"burn the witch\\" \\"blood is love\\" and \\"the long slow good bye\\" all the tracks though are far above par. Another point i'd like to set out is that Josh Homme is a control freak and has a big grasp on most things he works on, even when nick was in the band i'm sure most of the concept was josh homme. It's great music and probably the best rock music out there in todays world of crap, one of the few bands in todays world i like. Brilliant lyrics that cut like a sharp knife are on this album some are more like a butter knife like \\"everybody knows that you're insane\\" but for the most part great lyrics. It's an entertaining album. For all you haters out there you would most likely say it was garbage even if dave grohl, nick oliveri were still playing in it and mark lanegan did more vocals then just one song, essentially you'd bitch even if it was another songs for the deaf, because you just like to complain. I give it 4 and 3/4 out of 5 so it's close enough to 5 good music is good music period.

1400034779|5.0|This unique and lyrical book is about Mma Ramotswe's detective agency, which so happens to be \\"the number one ladies' detective agency\\". It's also the ONLY ladies' detective agency in Botswana, Africa, which is where the novel takes place. I loved the author's descriptions of Botswana: even though I've never been to Africa, I could picture everything he described perfectly. Normally I don't care for books in the \\"mystery\\" genre, but this book is just so much more. The main characters are heart warming, and I liked Mma Romotswe's attitude towards life in Africa--not always easy, but always beautiful. A wonderful book, and I highly recommend it.
B000093FLA|5.0|Fans of gangster movies, especially those with some comedy will love this one. I bought this based on the reviews here, and I'm glad I did. Being a fan of movies like \\"Weekend at Bernie's\\", \\"Get Shorty\\", \\"Formula 51\\", and \\"The Transporter\\", I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this movie. It has superb editing, great acting, and wonderful music. It was so seamlessly made I have to say I am surprised this was not a big hit. But at least apparently it is getting its second wind like \\"Get Shorty\\" did some time after it was released on DVD. Don't be surprised if we don't see a sequel to this one in a couple years. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie.<br /><br />It drew me along and familiarized me with the characters as we went down this winding path. The characters you thought would be killed somehow survive, and those you expected not to die are sometimes killed. The ways they are killed are often funny. There truly is genius that went into putting this all together. I didn't use the subtitles and I loved it in its raw in your face form. Most of the dialogue is easily discernable if you have watched Brit movies for awhile. If not it may take you a couple viewings to take it all in. Quite honestly I'm looking forward to watching this again very soon. It has great replayability and plenty of extras on the disc. The picture and sound quality were excellent.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Between U-571 and this, the U.S. is trying damn hard to one up the likes of China, Japan, Russia and most of the Middle East in attempts at overt, revisionist history. Justifying Japan's brutal and aggressive campaign throughout Asia and the attack on Pearl Harbor? FDR standing (standing-up???!!!) in front of his advisors to make a point? Japanese fighters strafing people on taramcs and survivors floating in the water? Bombing the hospital? Dory Miller shooting down planes? The script also contains some of the worst 'romantic' dialog since \\"Attack of the Clones.\\" Honestly, Ben-Lo should attempt another career path...seriously. I'm beginning to think the same about Beckinsale. She was terrific in \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" but this and \\"Underworld\\" are near career-killers. I advoided this film for nearly 4 years but my curiosity got the best of me and boy am I sorry for letting it happen. Cripes, what a pinched loaf.
0679731725|4.0|The remains of the day was aired on BBC radio, which is where I heard it for the second time, well parts of it at least. They also did an interview with the author which was quite interesting and which led me to get this book.  <br /> <br />The story is about an English butler who, after a lifetime of service, takes a short six-day vacation to see the English countryside and visit an old `professional' lady friend (a former housekeeper at Darlington Hall). <br /> <br />On the trip he thinks back to life in Darlington Hall and has an internal - almost Socratic - dialogue about the meaning of dignity. In the end, Mr Stevens (our butler) reasons that it comes down to `not taking off one's clothes in public.' Ishiguro creates out of a seemingly plain series of events a great introspective work.  <br /> <br />In his interview he mentioned that we; those not in positions of great power or influence, could be considered butlers because we serve others who have authority over us. Whether the analogy is accurate, the point is that most of us serve someone and our sense of fulfillment comes from having done a job well. An interesting issue that the book raises is whether an employee should let his or her conscience get in the way of doing a good job, which was the position that Stevens was placed in at Darlington Hall. <br /> <br />The strange thing about this book is that it feels sparse, Spartan almost. There is economy in the words, the descriptions and even the language itself. I don't know whether Ishiguro deliberately did this, but the book feels like a Japanese garden.  <br /> <br />This is one of those interesting short books that should be read by everyone, I would highly recommend it. <br />

This is the album that combined all the elements and the execution was a success.  <br /> <br />A lot of people say grunge killed this band off. Excuse me?? If grunge successfully got rid of BJ then why are they still here still with multiplatinum albums??  <br /> <br />This is by far their greatest album and proved to the world that BJ can reinvent themselves and do it well. Dry County is a brilliant song which gives a hint that they are tapping into Bruce Springsteen territory, whilst I'll sleep when I'm dead is more of a party song. <br /> <br />Keep The Faith went on to sell 10 million copies worldwide making another hit on the BJ list. Highly recomended, especially for those that thought 80s hair metal sucked
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!! I agree with everything the kid says, I have seen it every weekend for a month and am counting down the days until May 3rd! I have yet to see the stage version, but my mom saw it and says the movie is drastically better, that she missed half the play on stage and never really got it. I have the extended soundtrack, the script book, and the original novel by Gaston Leroux. I read the novel after I saw the movie, and I must say I love Andrew Lloyd Webber's production a whole lot more. The novel is good but it is too horror-y, I like the tragic-love side of the Phantom that Webber has captured. <br />  <br />No matter what the critics say, I think Schumacher did a wonderful job on this film. The journey to the lair is amazing (will always dream of having a sexy guy pull my down into the darkness, haha) and point of no return is one of the most electrically charged scenes I have every seen, by far my favorite. <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum was absolutly amazing!! I am a singer myself, in fact I sang Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again for a scholarship and got the scholarship! But that's not the point. Emmy is perfect in the role of the young beautiful singer, torn between two men. In the roles of Schumacher, \\"Christine's relationship with Raoul is really her romantic awakening as a teenager. But I think that her pull towards the Phantom is a very sexual, very deep, soulful union.\\" BRILLIANT. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler is, let me say, *cough*SEXY*cough*, but I'm not shallow. He is a brilliant Phantom with his voice that reaches to your soul from his raspy, dark low notes to his pure high A in music of the night, he is perfect. I haven't seen Crawford, and I am sure all you adoring fans of his will say I have a biased opinion, but I am sorry. Gerry is sexy, powerful, and tugs at my heart strings. <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson is a very good Raoul. While I don't like his character very much, I've always thought Christine should stay withthe Phantom, his scene with Emmy, All I Ask Of You is beautiful and very romantic. He has a great voice, though his hair seems a tad too long. <br /> <br />Minnie Driver was hilarious and though the operatic singing was dubbed in (which I completley understand, that stuff is hard!), her rendition of learn to be lonely is beautiful and tragic. I wish she had sung it at the Oscars instead of that stupid Beyonce.  <br /> <br />Miranda Richardson is great, she is one of my favorites, I love her accent! (she is set to play in the next Harry Potter film). Her daughter played by Jennifer Ellison is also good, although her dress at the masquerade ball was a little...um...well...lets just say she looked fake. The two Opera owners, Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds are hilarious, I love Hinds hair! (to hell with Gluck and Handel have a scandel and your sure to get a hit!) <br /> <br />All in all, this movie was amazing and I regret having the Oscars done by Hollywood because I think that at least one musical should win something to show people you don't have to have dopey sex scenes and violence to make a good movie. <br /> <br /> <br />Learn to be lonely <br /> <br />Life can be lived <br /> <br />Life can be loved... <br /> <br />alone.

B00005QIPH|5.0|On their debut, the Strokes have proven that simple, classic-style rock is best: just guitars, bass, drums, and vocals, no flashy overproduction. Contemporaries of the White Stripes, they helped bring back real rock music, and save it from groups like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park. <br /> <br />Nikolai Fraiture and Alfred Hammond Jr. have a brilliant chemistry when they play their guitars, and are a perfect match to Julian Casablancas' fuzzy, understated vocals and intelligent songwriting. Though the album didn't spawn any major hit singles--only the relatively successful \\"Someday\\" and \\"Last Nite\\"--all of the songs are quite catchy. The standout tracks of the album are \\"Barely Legal,\\" on which Casablancas puts forth a fantastic effort in his singing, and the toned-down \\"Trying Your Luck\\", which, despite being the most somber and depressed song on the album, isn't really that sad. <br /> <br />What's clear is this: catchy, guitar-centered rock music is back. This is the kind of music you listen to while driving on a nice summer day with the windows down. Tracks like \\"Soma\\" will have you singing along even if you can't understand a word Casablancas is saying.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Man, this movie is truly unique. I must admit that I didn't pay any attention to it until a friend told me to check it out, and I'm glad I did because my 24 piece set is flippin' sweet!!

B000002MY3|5.0|There's a reason why \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was named Best Rock Album and Album of the year at the 1996 Grammys. Though Alanis's music has been described as completely angry--which it is--the way she expresses such anger is intelligent and honest.    The first single, \\"You Oughta Know\\" (Grammy Winner for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance) is the best example of Alanis's rage. The lyrics are biting, and the sound is very edgy: buzzing guitars and harsh voicals. \\"See Right Through You\\" is another song with a hard-rock sound and incredibly bitter lyrics. Similarly, \\"All I Really Want\\" expresses deep frustration with a heavy emphasis on electric guitar    On the other hand, a number of the songs are more mellow, though for the most part they retain a rock feel. \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" and \\"You Learn\\" are much more toned-down in lyrical content, but fitting with the rest of the album. \\"Head Over Feet\\" would presumably be the most out of place song on the record; it's an utterly devotional love song. Even so, it's a great song and fits right in with everything else. Alanis makes frequent use of her excellent harmonica playing, and the songs where it is included are all the better for it.    The overall flow of the album is quite good--there's a nice mix of harder grunge tracks and the mellower songs. Alanis is a fantastic rock artist, and this is a fantastic rock album.
0767834739|1.0|THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE! <br /> <br /> I have never seen anything so insultingly lame! How can people actually LIKE this garbage?! If any proof is needed that our education system has went into the toilet, the popularity of this stupid crap is it. This is not a movie, it's a movie trailer with no story to advertise. If I could give it negative stars, I definitely would.  <br /> <br /> If you like wrestling and have more than two little Nascar numbers adhered to your car, you'll probably like this inbred junk, otherwise avoid it at all costs. Even that \\"Alien vs. Predator\\" crap was not this bad, and it reeked as well. The reason they make crappy movies like this is because morons keep paying to see and own them. You people are ruining the world for the rest of us.  <br /> <br /> If you want to see an actual HORROR movie, pick up The Exorcist, The Shining, Dawn of the Dead (the original, not that stupid remake piece of filth), or Session 9. Those films had a few advantages over this one. For starters, they had DIRECTORS, not Hollywood, pony-knub sporting cel-phone addicts whose parents bought them a career. Secondly, they had STORIES. Actual CHARACTERS with THOUGHTS, say it with me, THOUGHTS...that's right. Their brains were involved in what was happening in the film, they weren't merely posing with guns and puckering their lips at the camera. <br /> <br /> This movie is for fans. Do you know what a fan is? It's a person who has already decided that they like something before they have even seen it. that is a form of prejudice. Fans are not flattering to a true Artist, because they aren't evaluating the Artists performance objectively, they are merely \\"yes-men\\". Cheerleaders. The true Artist doesn't want cheers for bad work. And the hack actor secretly laughs at the fans when they accept garbage as quality.  <br />  <br /> I'm not trying to be spiteful, but we are being had. There is an elephant in the living room, and someone has to say it. <br /> <br /> If you can'tsee that ALL movies like this are nothing but commercial garbage to feed the great American cattle drive, then you are either hopelessly ignorant, or borderline retarded. There are lots of great movies to see and own, you are wasting your life watching this crap when you could be seeing movies that keep you thinking about them and their characters for days, weeks, months even. Sometimes YEARS. Life is too short for this level of stupidity. <br /> <br /> If you DO like it and buy it and even (gag) watch it AGAIN, remember that every time some moron is driving like an idiot and holding you up in traffic, it is because the entertainment industry is dumbing down the country, and they get away with it because people like you are helping them. Movies should involve your brain. They should not use flashy camera moves to try and hide the inadequacies of the writer and director. Stop helping Hollywood make people stupid for money, after all, they aren't giving you any of the money they make. <br /> <br /> Or consider this. The people who make movies in hollywood are the same people who nominate and award Oscars. They don't EVER, EVER nominate or award this kind of movie. That is because even THEY DON'T LIKE THEIR OWN FILMS!!! They pretend to in interviews and in commentary tracks, but obviously they aren't going to say \\"Well, actually, me and Herbert Bumble-dong only wrote, directed, and produced this film because of all the money we can make off of bovine America\\". They wont say that into the camera. They say that to their peers, though. otherwise, their peers would think they were fools. Because only a fool would like a movie this bad.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt is ever evolving, and always genre-defying. With this album, they have successully brought New Wave back to the forefront. Several songs here rely heavily on synthesizers, such as \\"Running,\\" \\"Making Out,\\" and the album's first single, \\"Hey Baby\\" (Grammy Award winner for Best Pop Performance by a Group, 2003). What's surprising about this is that they do a good job of combining this New Wave sound with their traditional instrumentals--Tom's guitar, Tony's bass, and Adrian's drums are as good as ever. \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\" is a solid rock song, and other tracks--second single \\"Hella Good\\", \\"Detective\\"--do a fine job of incorporating the rock instruments into the synth-pop sound. <br /> <br />Also present on this album is a reggae feel, on songs such as \\"Start The Fire\\" and the album's third single, \\"Underneath It All,\\" (Grammy Award winner for Best Pop Performance by a Group, 2004), which resembles the ska sound that made No Doubt famous. Also worth mentioning is Gwen's vocal work, which is amazing. This is especially evident on the closing track, \\"Rock Steady\\": the dubbing and overlay of her voice creates an amazing harmony. <br /> <br />With any other artist, an album that combined equal parts Rock, Reggae, and New Wave would likely sound horrible... but with No Doubt, it works perfectly. The fact that such an eclectic album was hailed by critics as the best of No Doubt's career thus far is a true testament to their genius.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|An absolute masterpiece!  A unique fusion of diverse musical influences made to coexist beautifully in this original work.  The musical creativity as well as quality of production have taken a big step forward from the band's previous releases.  Also, the album is not merely a collection of songs, but rather a coherent storyline spanning twelve songs.  While the individual songs are in themselves very unique, they seamlessly flow into each other both musically and lyrically (that is if you speak Hebrew, English, and Latin) to form this epic piece.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The movie starts out like the first two, with Mr. Potter (Radcliffe) being miserable at \\"home\\" with his mean relatives. But they are more aware of his powers now and they almost fear him. But after an unfortunate \\"baloon\\" incident, Potter decides to take his leave for good of the family, and after a bizarre/entertaining bus ride and a visit to the Ministry of Magic, Harry is back at his real home of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But, of course, there is much to fear at school, this time with the prison break of the supposedly-nefarious Sirius Black (Oldman), who, of course, is looking for our young Mr. Potter.<br /><br />I was very interested to see how this movie would turn out, mainly to see how the new director, Alfonso Cuaron and the new Headmaster Dumbledore, Michael Gambon would pan out. As it turns out, while Cuaron did an admirable job, although he made changes I disagreed with, Gambon just didn't work out as Dumbledore. For one, he had a totally different look than the late Richard Harris did as Dumbledore. They changed his wardrobe extensively, even though it had been nearly identical in the first two movies. They obviously couldn't make Gambon exactly like Harris, but the way he portrayed Dumbledore, it was like they wanted to create a totally different character. Gambon was more playful and curious, contrasting the stoic nature that Harris portrayed so nicely in the first two movies. The changes were just too drastic, especially this deep in the series, and especially given the immense popularity of the books and the movies. Harris' death was very unfortunate, and to Gambon's credit, he tried admirably to step up to the role. But it really didn't work at all for me.<br /><br />Almost everything about this series is high-profile, but the one possible exception to this would be the script and screenwriter. Steve Kloves has written the first three movies, and he will continue to write the others, and I don't think he gets enough credit for his work. Yeah, the books are probably better than the movies, but that is almost always the case with any adaptation. But I think Kloves, who wrote a favorite of mine, Wonder Boys, does a great job with the script, with some nice dialogue and a nice, cinematic adaptation of the plot. I've heard arguments about what they left out of the book, but honestly, you just can't have everything from the book in the movie. I would've liked to see some more Quidditch, but I guess there is not that much in this book. Oh well.<br /><br />Director Alfonso Cuaron creates probably the most beautiful Potter movie yet. His sets are quite lushly created and it is all shot nicely. What I didn't really understand was why they made such drastic changes to Hogwarts. In the first two movies, Hagrid's hut was right near the forrest, but in this movie it's in a totally different location, at the bottom of some hill. I don't really know why they changed it, because it's obviously different, and if there is some explanation as to why it's different, they don't give it. I didn't like his work with Gambon at all, but he does bring out a lot more in Radcliffe than we've seen before. Overall, he does a fine job, but there are some of his decisions that didn't really pan out for me.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban does work on many levels, but some of it just doesn't work at all. Potter looks older, Dumbledore looks younger...well, he is younger, technically, and while this is visually beautiful and a fairly entertaining movie, it doesn't quite conjur the same magic as the first two movies.his work.

B00004T8RK|5.0|This was the first Pearl Jam album I bought, and it easily stands up to the rest. What I think people don't like about it, is that Pearl Jam has matured over the years, leaving behind the angry visage they once had. If you see past that, and listen to the songs themselves, you will enjoy it very much.
0553381350|4.0|\\"The Right Stuff\\" by Thomas Wolf details the manned space race between Russia and the United States. It focuses on the United States' effort to put a man into space. The story of the first seven American astronauts is told, along with a description of test pilots, scientists, and others involved with space flight during this time. Tom Wolfe accurately depicts the personalities of the cocky test pilots and their change throughout the book, where in the end, the end of being the heroes of the Space Race. The Space Race was, in fact, a vital part of our history and is the reason for some of our major technological advances today. This book is a great read and will really give the reader a taste of the time and views from Americans about this Race at the time.
6302952573|3.0|This is a watchable and disturbing film, but it raises my hackles a bit. Leaving aside the whole &quot;Is the film racist?&quot; discussion that taking up so much space I think what bothers me about it is the way Billy Hayes is portrayed as some sort of tragic hero, a misguided youth victimized by a brutal system. For God's sake, he was a drug smuggler! I think the script should have played up on that angle a bit more and we would have had a much more thoughtprovoking film. On the plus side, though, there are some very good performances and the soundtrack is worth hearing.
0425179877|2.0|Gene Kranz's experience from inside mission control is one that not many Americans experience for themselves. This riveting book expresses the problems that he had to encounter and overcome. Kranz was a major contributor to the success of the space flight operations and all of his accomplishments are revealed right in this book. Kranz's competitive edge to segue America's \\"space world\\" into the number one position and his daringness in the Mercury to Apollo missions not only helped unite Americans, instigating a feeling of national pride, but it also wired the world together to work in one common effort. Kranz is able to provide behind the scene information, sharing the myths and stories of the media about the men in the mission control and thus providing the reader with the true untwisted story.          Through this novel, Kranz takes us back to the primitive age of technology when there were no books previously written on the actual methodology of space flight. This book is truly enthralling for everyone, not just space buffs interested in the detail of flight control. The network of trust and driven scientists motivates the readers to read hours on end. The emotional conflict and skepticism provided by Kranz illustrates the intense life of these men. This book takes us behind the scenes of Apollo 13 and lays out all of the problems and obstacles that the controllers on the ground had to solve and overcome. By the end of the novel one can truly say that failure is not an option, especially not for Gene Kranz.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|I, like many, gave up on Sabbath when Dio left. I even know fans that gave up right after Ozzy left! I loved the Ozzy years and I loved the Dio years even more [I'm a bigger fan of Dio, but that's just a personal taste :-)] After Dio left, I just lost interest in the band and didn't even give their ablums after the departure a try. Well, one day while scrounging through a CD store, my eyes fell upon TYR for a real cheap price. I decided what the hell and purchased it. After I put the disc on, my reaction was WOW! The whole disc was great from start to finish! Sabbath really did go on after Dio! And this Tony Martin fella...WOW does he have a set of pipes! I might be comitting blasphomy when I say this, but he could be better than dio :-O So if your a person like me and forgot about Sabbath after the Ozzy or Dio years, pick TYR. You will be glad you did!
B000002C25|4.0|I consider whats the story morning glory? to be one of the single greatest albums of the 90's perhaps of all time. After that album and oasis greatest hits compilation became simply unthinkable because you couldnt mention one of the songs without mentioning the other 9, and with and epic closing like champagne supernova, it left even them most casual fan thristing for more. That \\"more\\" was answered with the follow up \\"be here now\\" Oasis's third. D'you know what i mean is a perfect opener, not quite on par with the epic scope of champagne supernova, but still a stunning return. The next track, my big mouth, though not having quite that effect, is awesome also.  <br /> <br />Its with magic pies that it becomes evident that this album is flawed. Morning glory didnt have a single track that i would skip. Magic pies is the first track that you will skip. Maybe it wouldnt be so bad if it didnt ramble on for seven and a half minutes, but then, it doesn't sound like oasis enough anyway, and a cut in length couldnt rescue it. Thats the problem with this track, and also the problem with every oasis album after this point. Noel sings lead vocals. I'll give him props for his songwriting because its great (come on he wrote morning glory himself) but Liam is by far the better singer. Without liam at vocals the oasis sound isnt there. Noel's songwriting is equally important to the oasis equation. Neither can work well without the other, and even though they hate each others guts, thats how it is. As a result, magic pies is a complete throwaway. <br /> <br />Things get back on track with stand by me, the best track on the record, and in my opinion oasis at the top of their game. <br />The next few tracks are almost as good, being catchy rockers with no vocalist switching. <br /> <br />The only other real bump is fade in-out, which is just plain average. Once again the length problem remains and the track rambles on for 6 plus minutes without actually doing anything worth merit. Thetitle track is kind of a letdown as well, but it grows on you with each listen. <br /> <br />Luckily as ever, the album rescues itself in the end and pulls off an excellent closing. \\"Dont go away\\" really does sound like it could have come off morning glory, both the vocals, melody, and instrumentation recreate the exact feeling i have when listening to that record. The last two tracks however are the ones that really pulls this record up from just above average to very good. All around the world is an incredibly self assured nine and a half minute rock opus, half of it being vocals, the other half an incredible full band solo, with a guitar line almost as memorable as that of champagne supernova. The album closes with its getting better man, seven more minutes of pure rock and roll, and then of course the all around the world reprise, which although pointless, is nothing bad. <br /> <br />It may not be as memorable as morning glory or as down right rocking as definately maybe, but its another solid record from oasis, with a few gems included. <br /> <br />My track ranking is as follows <br /> <br />1.Stand By Me <br />2.D'you Know What I Mean? <br />3.All Around The World <br />4.Don't Go Away <br />5.Its Getting Better Man <br />6.My Big Mouth <br />7.I Hope, I Think, I Know <br />8.Be Here Now <br />9.The Girl In The Dirty Shirt <br />10.Fade In-Out <br />11.Magic Pies <br /> <br />At 72 minutes, be here now is oasis' longest. I recommend buying definately maybe and morning glory before this. It's flawed, but then again rock isnt about doing things perfectly. <br /> <br />8.5/10
B000002HMH|2.0|I have been a fan of Metallica for only about 7 months. I first heard \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" and was amazed. Since then I have gotten every album up to the Black Album and have been blown away by each one. I had heard that starting with \\"Load,\\" the quality of Metallica's albums had dropped, so I put off getting \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload,\\" while I vowed never to get \\"St. Anger.\\" Well, curiosity got the best of me and I bought \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" at the same time. The numerous bad reviews both on this site and by professional critics did not prepare me for what I heard. I have made three guesses as to what happened to Metallica, and here they are:  <br /> <br />1. (Putting the best construction on these albums) THEY DIDN'T WANT TO REPEAT THEMSELVES- If this is the case, you have to give Metallica credit, even though the experiment failed. They did not want to become an AC/DC, who has released nothing relevant since \\"Thunderstuck\\" about 20 years ago. AC/DC has stuck to pretty much the same formula that got them fans in the first place. Maybe Metallica wanted to keep their sound new, so if this is the case, fans should not be mad at Metallica for trying something new.  <br /> <br />2. THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE- At the time of these releases, Alterna-metal and country were huge, so Metallica decided, \\"why not combine the two for a new sound?\\" After all, they took the two kings of the early eighties, hardcore punk and heavy metal, and combined them to produce thrash. They continued to produce heavy metal while heavy metal was still insanely popular. Now that the two genres mentioned at the beginning are popular, Metallica decided that they wanted to remain a relevant force in the music business instead of \\"Fading to Black\\" like most of thrash and even heavy metal bands of the eighties.  <br /> <br />3. THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WERE MUSICAL GODS- They figured that no matter what they would spit out, they their fans would like it. In other words, their egos got too big. That would explain Hetfield actually singing here instead of his trademark growl. He decided that since he sounded great singing on \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" (and he really did, he wasn't wrong about that) that he could just sing all of his songs and have them sound great. He seems to have forgotten that the reason that he started using the growl in the first place was BECAUSE he couldn't sing. Metallica has also decided that what they have to say is more important than the actual songs themselves, which would explain the lack of heavy riffs or outstanding solos. With \\"Master\\" and \\"Ride\\" the lyrics were as much of an art as the music was. That was most of the reason that Metallica ruled, because they were the only ones with \\"intelligent thrash\\" while everyone else was singing about Satan and evil. The worst part of all this is that Metallica didn't have that much to say, some of the lyrics just plain suck. With nothing to sing about, it is hard to make a good album (the same problem that Ozzy's Ozzmosis had).  <br /> <br />As for the actual album, Load has no really good songs. \\"Until It Sleeps\\" received a lot of airplay, but is still only mediocre. Unfortunately, this is probably the best song on the album. Most of the songs on here are completely unlistenable. Metallica still fills most of their songs with their trademark hooks, but I can't get over the genre change. Maybe it's because I don't like alterna-metal or country. Perhaps when approached with an open mind, this album could be more enojyable. It's just hard for me to accept that the band that wrote so many good songs (\\"Battery,\\" \\"Sanitarium,\\" \\"...And Justice for All,\\" I could go on for about three more lines naming all of their great songs) could throw all of that away. To be truthful though, I still think that if they applied themselves, they could still put out excellent albums. I definitely recommend this for alterna-metal fans, and maybe even fans of southern rock, although maybe you should listen to sound clips first to know what you are getting into.
B0006B2A42|4.0|One of the better cold war dramas produced during the 60's, \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" isn't exactly an action adventure; it's more of an action drama. Most of the \\"action\\" is the dramatic conflict between Commander Ferraday (Rock Hudson) and his guests Boris Vaslov (Ernest Borgnine)a former Russian spy who now works for British Intelligence, MI-6 secret agent \\"David Jones\\" (the wonderful Patrick McGoohan) and Marine Captain Anders (Jim Brown). A nasty ice storm brews at the North Pole. When Ice Station Zebra calls for help the Tigerfish is sent north to break through the ice to save the men stationed there. That's the cover story. The reality is that a satellite has crashed in the arctic tundra and must be recovered before a Russian expeditition gets to it.<br /><br />The image quality is stellar on this first time release from Warner Brothers. There's hardly any analog or digital artifacts. While there's no commentary track we do get the original promotional featurette on the movie \\"The Man Who Makes a Difference\\" and it's actually pretty good at providing behind-the-scenes footage about the shooting of a real Navy submarine to be integrated with visual effects into the movie. The big attraction here is a wonderful 5.1 remix of the original soundtrack. While it's not as active as, say, a brand new movie, it sounds pretty darn good with better depth and expanded sound than any previous incarnation of the movie on home video.<br /><br />This was originally shot in SuperPanavision and, atlhough this is a widescreen presentation much like \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". It's a huge improvement on the previously cropped versions that have floated around. The original Overture from the roadshow edition of the movie has been restored to this version with Michel Legrand's marvelous score. The intermission is also included, hence the 2 hour and 30 minute running time.<br /><br />Patrick McGoohan took time away from shooting his series \\"The Prisoner\\" to make \\"Ice Station Zebra\\". Ironically he plays another secret agent. \\"David Jones\\" doesn't stray too far from John Drake the character he played in \\"Secret Agent Man\\" (aka \\"Danger Man in the UK)but McGoohan's clipped sarcastic delivery and unpredictabllity make him a stand out in the cast. Hudson's relaxed performance as the Commander provides a nice counter balance to McGoohan's intense one and provides a nice counter point to Borgnine's cagey Vaslov. The first half of the film is marvelous and, although it sags during the second half (for a lot of reasons) and the conclusion doesn't have the cinematic style of John Sturges' previous films (\\"The Great Escape\\" and \\"The Magnificent Seven\\")but, all in all, \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" still provides marvelous entertainment. The footage of the real submarine surfacing and going under the water looks marvelous.<br /><br />Nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects), \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" lost in both categories to \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". The visual effects that open the movie are still exceptionally good and wouldn't look out of place in Kubrick's film of the same year. That's ironic since MGM pulled \\"2001\\" from some theaters to premiere \\"Ice Station Zebra\\".Ironically he plays another secret agent. \\"David Jones\\" doesn't stray too far from John Drake the character he played in \\"Secret Agent Man\\" (aka \\"Danger Man in the UK)but McGoohan's clipped sarcastic delivery and unpredictabllity make him a stand out in the cast.

B0002YCVXI|5.0|I love the music of Ennio Morricone, but I usually am dissatisfied with the results when others arrange and play his music.  Mr. Morricone's music is quite idiosyncratic; thus, it is extremely difficult to capture the special elements that set his music apart.  Yo Yo Ma's playing is always stunning.  It is to his great credit that he actually chose to work with \\"the maestro\\" in creating this wonderful work.  The selection of these specific melodies is a stroke of genius.  While the result is very true to the original intent of the composer, the great cellist works wonders within that framework.  A purchase of this fine recording will immensely reward the listener.

B000001FG5|5.0|This CD brings back memories of the spring of 1979.  My mom and I were both fans of the Bee Gees and they had just had tremendous success with the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" soundtrack.  My mom bought this album for me, even though at the time the only hit from it was \\"Too Much Heaven\\".  I immediately loved every song on side 1 of the album.  Side 2 was good as well, but we played side 1 over and over.  As we all know, \\"Tragedy\\" and \\"Love You Inside Out\\" became the other hits.  But we also liked the other 2 songs from side 1, \\"Reaching Out\\" and \\"Spirits (Having Flown)\\".  My mom especially liked \\"Spirits (Having Flown)\\".  When it came out on CD, I had to have it.  I love these songs as much today as I did 26 years ago.   <br /> <br />Because of \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", the Bee Gees were unfairly labeled a disco group.  The only songs I would even remotely label as disco on this album are \\"Tragedy\\", \\"Search, Find\\" and \\"Living Together\\".  The other 7 songs are either trademark Bee Gee lush ballads or uptempo numbers (but not disco).  I consider \\"Love You Inside Out\\" an uptempo song, it does not have that driving disco beat to truly be a disco song.  They may have been guilty of riding the disco bandwagon for a while, but so did many other artists of the time such as Rod Stewart, Paul McCartney, Barbra Streisand, Cher, etc.  Even hard rockers like KISS put out a disco-esque song (\\"I Was Made for Loving You\\").  I think that the Bee Gees and Donna Summer are two examples of artists whose music transcended disco. <br /> <br />The Brothers Gibb have released some good music since then, but this was their absolute best. Highly recommended!
B00003CXBH|5.0|The Mission is a tremendous film about South America colonial politics in the 18th century.  Based on a true story, it shows how Catholic Missions and their priests on one level protected Indian tribes from greedy businessmen, while the Church hierarchy had to compromise with the Spanish and Portuguese governments in order to prevent the Church's complete expulsion from South America (Unfortunately, the Portuguese eventually did kick the Jesuit Missionaries out of their colonies, thus removing the most active protectors of the native peoples).   <br /> <br />The film also focuses on the power of faith to redeem even the most rotten of scoundrels (Deniro).  A touching, fantastic, and powerful film.  No wonder the Vatican (on their website) rates The Mission as one of the top 100 films of all time.
0786890754|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect upon purchasing PS I Love You; but once I started, I absolutely could not put it down until I read cover to cover!  I found myself laughing out loud at certain parts and holding back tears in others.  What strikes some critics as \\"shallow\\" or \\"immature\\" is what I interpreted as REAL.  The main character avoids the shallow cliche of falling in love with and ultimately living happily ever after with the good looking, willing, and most obvious available option.  What makes this book such a deep but fun read is the imperfections of ALL characters and the difficult truth that coping with the loss of a loved one isn't as simple as moving on with the first person who presents himself as willing... No matter how tempting!
B00005JNQ8|5.0|I'm an interpreter with 9 languages under my belt, and I think Nicole KIDMAN is an incredible actress, not to mention the fact that she is absolutely to die for BEAUTIFUL. I had to see this film...    it's quite entertaining, I would actually give it a 9 on the 1 - 10 scale. My favorite films with Nicole Kidman are BIRTHDAY GIRL and THE HUMAN STAIN
B0000X61UU|5.0|I'm a workout DVD junkie, which is the only reason I picked this one up when I'd read mixed reviews about the safety (or lack thereof) of Cindy's workouts. I found this one to be surprisingly good, though. I love the look of the workout and the music, and the exercises offered aren't at all like those on my other DVDs. Instead of typical flyes, she controls the weights in a circular motion over her head. They're really unique moves, and I've been sore after every workout -- even though I'm only using 7-pound weights and I usually use 10-15 pounds. She also doesn't do typical sets, which is a big plus to me. She'll present three or four exercises that work the same muscles, but the exercises will be slightly different so you don't THINK you're doing the same stuff over and over again. I love that, because something mentally happens to me when I think I'm stuck in sets. <br /> <br />I also like the water breaks that are built into the workout. It's nice to have a 15-to-20-second breather to catch your breath and drink some water. <br /> <br />Safety-wise, I have no issues with this workout, which is impressive since I have major low-back problems. I lay off what's clearly not good for my back, and Cindy even says to modify certain moves to protect your back. I don't do the full sit-ups, for example, and I modify the trunk circles. If you use common sense, you shouldn't have a problem. <br /> <br />As an instructor, Cindy really impressed me. Despite my huge workout DVD collection, I actually hate most of them because they feel so cheesy. I'll stop doing the routine if my husband walks in the room because I'm flat-out embarassed to be working out to a lady chirping, \\"You can do it!\\" Cindy doesn't do any of that, and I love it. She doesn't give a lot of chatter. The moves are still easy to follow because she does 10 per limb, then moves on. You're able to focus on what you're doing -- assuming you can count to 10, I suppose -- while listening to the great music. <br /><br />For people wondering how this one compares to Cindy's first, \\"Shape Your Body,\\" I have a little insight as I just bought that one this week. The criticisms over Cindy's form are totally justified in the first video. You can clearly see how she and Radu, her instructor, took the balking to heart and improved the second release. If you know form already, \\"Shape Your Body\\" is fine -- just don't do it the way Cindy does it. But \\"Next Challenge\\" is definitely superior.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|This story is so rich with life lessons, human emotions, mature love, dreams, laughter, and bonding.  I was truley surprised to find it so.  I watched the movie without really knowing much about it, thinking that it was going to be about a man falling in love with another woman and learning how to dance.  It wasn't that at all. Instead, I found it to be tender, dignified, and rife with committed love between a husband and wife.  It was refreshing to see this in a hollywood story today. Susan Sarandon and Richard Gear and beautiful together and I'd like to see them together in another project. Big thumbs up to the makers of this film.
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|Dated? YES! Slow? YES! Suspenseless with lots of failed attempts at intrigue? YES! Well filmed, but not remarkably so? YES! Humor so subtle that it ceases to be funny? YES!   - All told, i find it hard to understand why Critereon hasn't picked this one up, packaged it with a 2nd disc of useless \\"extras\\" and priced it at 35 bucks.  - Yes, there are some very thought-provoking aspects to this \\"story\\".  Yes, it asks some meaningfull questions about life and the human condition (at least the financially-sucsessfull white male humans) in a decadent postmodern world.  And yes, there is some pretty hot sexual tension evoked at one point; BUT IS IT  ENTERTAINING?  I, for one, didn't think so - but perhaps iv'e just been spoiled by all the hollywood spectacle and easy laughs of American movies (though, i have to wonder then: if that's the case, why do i so love Fellini and Jarmusch?).  I imagine this is how Pedro Almodovar's movies will appear when veiwed for the first time 40 years from now.  In any case, i suggest you ignore the canon-worshiping of all the critics and see it BEFORE you buy it on DVD, so you can decide for yourself.
B000060P79|1.0|I'd just like to start off this review by telling Simple Plan fans, you are ignorant to assume only fans should be here. If only fans were to write album reviews, every CD on Amazon would be rated five stars. I really won't care when you kids vote this review as not being \\"helpful\\" just because you don't like my opinion. Read the whole thing before you vote.        I'm going to make my point quick: don't buy this album. Actually, I don't recommend buying any album from \\"poser-punk\\" bands like Good Charlotte, Avril Lavigne, A New Found Glory, Yellowcard or Sum 41. Sure, maybe 2 or 3 of those bands may have been good with their debut album. Since then, MTV has made them popular, changed their audience into teenyboppers. Do you know how humiliating you feel when you say you like(d) Bowling For Soup now?        Sum 41 and A New Found Glory's first one or two albums were just fine. Every other band on that mini-list is phony. Pop and trying to be punk. Simple Plan and Good Charlotte may write their own lyrics, but they're simply younger versions of better bands that came before them.         If you really think about it, Simple Plan is just Blink-182 or MxPx at 25, just acting like they're 14. Still, Simple Plan's lyrics even sound like they're written by a thirteen-year-old (words/phrases like \\"worst ever\\" are used over and over; about the first 15 seconds of \\"The Worst Day Ever\\" and \\"Don't Mean Anything\\" sound identical). Speaking of age, I don't really trust any band that's fanbase is pushing high school.        Plan (and all bands like them) is just a boy band with a few instruments. *N Sync with a couple of guitars. Buy a Hot Topic shirt; instead of writing your own music, take the words from Backstreet Boys songs - remove words like \\"baby\\" and \\"girl\\"; save up enough to get a skateboard and call yourself punk. Yeah, very original. Simple is a joke to punk rock. The worst part of listening to their music is having to deal with the voice of a twenty-five-year-old who sounds like someone stole his testicles.       Only angst-ridden middle schoolers who do nothing but stay up all night and hang out in malls all day would buy this album. Wanna hear a grown man whine into a microphone over noise like a brat? Then buy this stupid album. Wanna hear real punk instead of listening to artists who just \\"dress\\" punk? See: The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, NOFX, The Vandals.
B000001EMW|5.0|Who knew cellos could rock? <br /> <br />Who knew there was this much depth to Metallica's music? <br /> <br />Not me, prior to listening to Apocalyptica.  This album gives a boost to both the cellists and the band.  Special kudos to the Finns who have arranged eight great songs with a precise and admiring hand.  Master of Puppets, Unforgiven, and Welcome Home (Sanitarium) sound at times like they were made for a string quartet.  Oddly, the most recognizable song, Enter Sandman, is probably the weakest of the lot.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|It is quite boring to read reviews speaking about \\"blasphemy\\", \\"insult to Homer\\" and so on. First of all, the movie is a (clever) retelling of the whole myth. It is based not only on the Iliad, but also on other ancient sources. Besides, very little of the plot is really invented by the screenwriter. In the contrary, Benioff knows very well that some versions of the myth spoke about a Trojan priestess raped by Agamemnon, about Andromache escaping with Astyanax (who became the ancestor of the French royal dynasty), and so on.  <br />And please: we accept suggestions, but please don't ORDER us which movies we have either to see or not to see. This is annoying. <br />I saw rhe movie at least six times and I think it is really good, a well balanced mix of culture and fun. But I think that people are free to decide on their own.
B00000331V|5.0|You will not be dissapointed in this great sounding 2 lp on 1 cd set from the band that fused blues,funk,soul,rock IN A HIGH ENERGY mix. A tight jumpin unity fronted by a guy as Lou Reed sings \\"I wanna Be Black\\"..even though he remains a nice boy from the Bronx..The rest of the band was great defining themselves as one of the greatest live bands this cd backs that claim.Like the earlier Live,Full House this one really rocks and catches the band well rehearsed and tight at their prime.I do not hear bands like these guys anymore that makes it that much more sweeter.

B0007YEKZU|3.0|Interesting movie. <br /> <br />You've got slaptstick Keystone cops like comedy, impressive serious kung fu fighting, some brutal violence, special effects -good and bad and a cute mute ice cream seller with a lollipop. It seems though that this movie doesnt know what type of movie it wants to be. I think this is what made me keep watching it as I wanted to see what film genre it would next try to be. <br /> <br />Quality of the DVD was good both sound and picture. As far as the story goes, it was a little loose but generally kung fu movies arent known for their quality plots and executions anyway so I wasnt expecting much anyway. <br /> <br />Overall entertaining, at least on the first watch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0007P3582|4.0|I'm sick and tired of people bashing 50's new cd.  Everybody who listen's to or buys this record is begging for it to be just as good as \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" The album is good plain and simple if you expect every track to be a banger you fooling yourself that's what makes an exceptional album like \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" there's no rapper in this industry living or dead who has made hit music or every album top to bottom.  Also, don't play this record one time through skipping to the next song when you get bored and then think your opinion on the album has any creditibility.  Your not em, dre, or jay-z so don't try to be, don't pick apart a song your heard 40 sec. of one time in your car.  This album is as good as any out there right now you'll be rapping along with 50 in no time if you listen to this cd a few times and yes you will have to skip a few tracks get over it if every cd a good rapper puts out was perfect top to bottom we'd all take it for granted.
1400032717|5.0|This story is told from the point of view of Christopher, a 15-year-old autistic boy. A brilliant left-brained thinker and problem solver, Christopher cannot read people's emotions, cannot detect sarcasm, does not understand metaphors (but does understand similes because they use \\"like\\" or \\"as\\"), thinks the concept of God is silly, doesn't not like to be touched, cannot bear crowded rooms, will wet his pants rather than use a dirty public toilet, and has trouble focusing in our over-stimulating modern world.<br /><br />Christopher loves to solve problems, so when he finds his neighbor's dog, Wellington, pinned to the ground with a pitchfork in the opening chapter, he decides this is a mystery he must solve. What he uncovers is much more than who killed the dog. And what we are treated to along the way is an insightful, convincing look into the mind of someone whose mind works in a completely unique way. What seems like the everyday to most of us, takes a lot of courage for Christopher. In fact, anything out of the ordinary is a heroic effort for a boy who feels comfortable only in routine. And although we may not be able to relate to his exact mindset, Hadden does a wonderful job of making us feel how Christopher feels, and we certainly have sympathy for him.<br /><br />Aside from the convincing voice with which Haddon tells the story, the brilliance of this novel is that Christopher's point of view allows the reader to see and understand things the narrator does not. It reminded me of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in that regard. We know more about what is happening around Christopher than Christopher does. This also adds to the potency of some of the situations. Because Christopher does not grasp the gravity of death or divorce, he does not sugar-coat them like a \\"normal\\" adult narrator would. The writing is engaging, the narrative voice captivating, and I felt at times like I cared more about Christopher than he did. A very quick, very good read.
B000084T18|4.0|With all the hype built up behind this guy from finally getting a major label deal, I have to say he lived up to it with hits like \\"Patiently Waiting\\", \\"Many Men\\", \\"In Da Club\\", \\"Back Down\\", \\"Wanksta\\", basically there just isnt a bad song on this cd I love every one of them, its often hard to prove yourself to so much buildup especially as much as he had but props to him for doin his thing. I guess he is here for a reason
B000002MFE|5.0|Eric Clapton is an amazing artist, muisician and lyricist. His vocals are not the best but he then again one can not be great at everything. At the time this album, it was a trend to play unplugged and many artists and bands should not have done this. Clapton manages to do this quite well and shows that he is an accomplished muisician and artists. The book-let is nice if a bit sparse and the photo on the cover looks grainy and not all that well done. This is a nice after work recording to relax and drink some gin and tonic.
0393316041|4.0|\\"Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman!\\" is a collection of short stories in the form of a sort of autobiography by renowned physicist Richard Feynman, a developer of quantum electrodynamics who had a huge impact on modern science. The stories recount, as the subtitle states, \\"adventures of a curious character.\\" Throughout the book, one is unsure whether to throw the book against the wall as punishment for Feynman being such a pompous chauvinist pig or to smile and appreciate the professor's ridiculousness. One thing is for sure, though, he certainly does have a lot to say. In that sense, the adventures themselves and the abundance of books written by Feynman about his own life reveal his subtly pretentious mindset. Richard Feynman was a genius, and he knew this, in spite of all his self-doubt.  <br /> All the account provides an interesting look at a famous figure in different ways that one would have expected. The reader follows Feynman from a small town in New York fixing radios, to fooling his frat brothers at MIT, to working on the Manhattan Project, to playing the frigideira in a Brazilian samba band, to partying in Las Vegas, to a position as a \\"dignified\\" professor at first Cornell and later Cal Tech, and finally to heading the investigation of the Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986. He comes across as an exceedingly intelligent individual, but also as a human being with weaknesses (often creating humorous situations) just like everyone else. Feynman attempts to bring warmth and feeling to what is stereotyped as a cold and indifferent profession, at the same time portraying himself in a positive light. Feynman's enchantment with the beauty and simplicity of nature and scientific understanding is overwhelmingly evident throughout the book. He discusses the influences of his father and mother and the \\"charmed life\\" he lead in Los Alamos during World War II. Feynman describes the \\"different box of tools,\\" including the diagrams and integral paths, that made him so famous.  <br />Feynman is a halfway decent writer for a math nerd, but it is the humor that keeps the reader interested. Although the book provides a window into the life of a very interesting and ingenious man, it is meant more for a good laugh than for scientific enlightenment.  <br />
6304708521|1.0|This is one of my favorite Beatles movies..but this DVD release is nothing short of sacrilage!  The picture is grainy and horrible, the audio is rotten...they even had the nerve to drop the speed on the reprise of the title song at the end of the movie (listen....the song SHOULD be in E...it's in Eb here!) This is terrible...I'm amazed someone as reputable as Amazon even carries it. Let's hope for an official release of the movie soon.
0671027387|4.0|I can't say I liked this book as much as the first one, Angels & Demons, but then they're vastly different.<br /><br />This book is a well-researched story of how a popular senator's daughter gets unwittingly wrapped up in a tremedous discovery that turns out to be a sham, a scheme to gain political glorification.<br /><br />The discovery is earth-shattering: NASA has finally found evidence for life on other planets in a meteor. But as the story unravels, it is clear that it has been expertly and artificially made, so seamlessly that several experts validate the meteor's authenticity. When it is clear that the president has been elected upon these false pretenses for heroism, his opponent's daughter, our heroine, is determined to knock him off his wrongfully gained seat of power.<br /><br />This book is, as usual, a clever mystery that has both obvious clues, as well as those only an expert in such fields can guess. Though not as rich and poetic as the first installment in the series, it's still a very unusually good read full of scandal and corruption.
B00018TI5E|5.0|I should first say that I am a HUGE fan of John Frusciante as both a musician and a human being. But even I was shocked upon first listening to this album at just how good it is. Many of the lush sounds of the Chili's BTW album are built on here, with John having singular artistic control.  Some of the production values are raw, which some reviewers count off for, but I for one see as an endearing thing. (As in the case of the Beatles White Album).  So much of the music here is simply beautiful, particularly the oddly titled \\"Slaughter\\" and \\"Omission\\".  \\"Wednesday Song\\" sounds like authentic 60's pop, while \\"Carvel\\" reminds me of 70's prog music. This album is not easy to classify, but suffice to say it is worth owning for any lover of adventerous and beautiful music.
B00005221L|5.0|Is it me, or has Arnold's acting skills gone down hill over the years? He did a fine acting job in predator, but his movies since then, you almost wonder if he ever had any experience acting at all. I know that we all say, hey it's arnold, he doesn't need to be an oscar winning actor to be popular and likeable. All his movies, and corny calling card lines like I'LL BE BACK, doesn't change the fact that his movies are mainly \\"action\\". Blowing things up, shooting bad guys, chopping arms off, and yes he has done some extremly odd movies, such as \\"junior\\" (Oh my i'm almost ashamed to mention that I've seen it. It was horrible.) He should have just stuck to what he is good at. And that is sci-fi/action-thrillers such as PREDATOR. You still can enjoy predator to this day. The most unforgettable scene is when the alien takes his mask off for arnold. The face looked so real. It was all like moist, and freckled, and his teeth were shiny and yellow, and his gums were pink with saliva and he had that disgusting triple opening type jaw. And teeth both inside and outside of his mouth. How did they pull off such genius make up effects, or even the face itself. That is one hell of an imagination. If you saw this film for the first time, without knowing the date of when it was made, you'd never believe the date was 1987. I don't even believe it. I also think that the action music added to the intensity. I miss these type of movies. How can anyone say the 80's sucked. Like 90 percent of all my favorite movies were made in the 80's, and they were so creative that writers copy the ideas to this day. Of course we can't forget the occasional corny 80's flicks, but you can't say no good movies were made in the 80's. This is by far the best alien movie ever. The writer obviously knew about predatorial behavior. IE. when the alien is eating his dinner, and he rips out the flesh of that guy, and screams into the darkness like a hungry wolf. The fact that his main advantage is he can camoflauge himself like many animals can do in the jungle (changing color when they feel thereatened to blend in with the jungle.) It's as if the alien was made for the jungle. Next, tracking the soldiers by their body heat. Like snakes do. Rapid movement and body heat. But then you know he is from outer space because of his heavily equipped body, weapons, aimers, controllers, lasers, knives. You almost stop believing that they can even kill it. And at the end when arnold discovers he too can be invisible with mudd, was GENIUS. Too bad he falls in the pond and it all washes off. The guy who played the alein was this big and tall black guy. I forget his name but he also had a small part in the movie i think, as himself. He must of been hella hot in that space outfit. This will always be one of my favorite movies. I saw it when i was a kid, and still love it. It's entertaining, funny, scary, intelligent, intense, and a classic. It is great.
0060989157|5.0|I've read like 6 books in my life and completed about 3 of them, but this is the first time I haven't been able to put the book down. It takes you into each band members life and tells about all their personal problems. Easily a 5 star book. Any Crue fan will love this book.
B00005JNTV|5.0|With the appearance of SIN CITY (I managed to see it at a preview the day before general release), we have what is easily the finest adaptation yet of any graphic novel.  Not merely that, this amazing film replicates the visual excitement, dynamic vitality, and dramatic stylization of the genre.  SIN CITY isn't merely based on Frank Miller's film noir graphic tales, but an astonishingly accurate translation into a new version.  For that reason alone the film would stand out as one of the more remarkable films of recent years.<br /><br />Thankfully, SIN CITY is much more than a mere screen equivalent of some superb graphic tales:  it is by any standard a film of the front rank.  The success can be traced primarily to two individuals:  director Robert Rodriguez and writer Frank Miller.  Most fans will know that Miller has long resisted having his works turned into film, until Rodriguez sent him a brief test piece that would have knocked the hesitation of even the most sceptical author.  Miller's stories pay homage to the entire film noir and hardboiled tradition that began with Dashiell Hammett and BLACK MASK magazine (and its imitators) and has continued all the way until today with contemporary masters like James Ellroy, but he also gives each story a remarkable twist, while embedding all in a mythological setting.  Rodriguez's genius is in finding effective means to reincarnate these stories digitally.  I have been a fan of Rodriguez ever since I saw EL MARIACHI when it first came out, a film that I still consider the best no-budget film ever made, and despite the cost of the film one that will stand comparison with most of the big budget films ever made.  I have followed his subsequent career with both delight and dismay, as he did a shockingly inferior Hollywood remake of EL MARIACHI in DESPERADO that was a pale imitation of the original, and then made a string of movies that were either good (the first two SPY KIDS films), interesting if uneven (FROM DUSK TIL DAWN), or perplexingly unsuccessful (DESPERADO and ONCE UPON A TIME N MEXICO).  None of these seemed to fulfill the enormous promise of EL MARIACHI.  This one does.  This is the kind of film that possibly signals the emergence of a very promising director to the level of a great one.  The movie truly is that good.<br /><br />The film features an impressive cast, but this is not an actor's movie and they add less than one might expect.  That is not to say that they are not used well.  Indeed, Rodriguez uses all of the superbly.  Some are almost unrecognizable under various prostheses, in particular Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro, neither of whom you would know was in the film unless made aware of it.  This film, in fact, represents something of a comeback for Rourke, who started off in the early 1980s as a hardboiled performer who seemed to have stepped off the pages of a Jim Thompson novel.  We've seen Bruce Willis do good things before (in addition to a lot of bad things), so his excellent job as a used up cop almost manically dedicated to preventing a young girl from being raped and murdered is no surprise.  Clive Owen, on the other hand, has been better in the past and will be better in the future.  One brilliant bit of casting was putting Jessica Alba in a key role (I'll skip the name because it would involve a spoiler).  I've always argued with friends that although Alba is without question one of the most stunningly attractive women in movies today, she is oddly not very good at being sexy.  Sure, she is sexy in that she has a face and body that are improbably perfect, but instead of radiating sex, she always manages to radiate sweetness and innocence.  You see her at length and you inevitably end up thinking, \\"You know, she seems like she has to be a really sweet soul.\\"  That quality comes out here as well, and it tremendously adds to the believability of the story line of which her character is a part.  One actor whose presence is memorable even though itinvolved little contribution on his part was Elijah Wood as Kevin, who looks like a blend between a nerd and a manikin, but fights like a super ninja while sharing some of Hannibal Lecter's less appealing dietary habits.<br /><br />Each of the three major stories that are intertwined in the film revolves around a primary character acting as knight-errants.  In his foundational series of detective novels and stories, Raymond Chandler conceived of Phillip Marlowe as the modern, cynical embodiment of the medieval knight dedicated to fighting for damsels in distress.  Miller embraces this ideal completely in the three stories found here.  In Bruce Willis's sequence, he sacrifices everything to protect the innocent young Nancy.  In Mickey Rourke's amazing Marv sequence, a thuggish, seemingly indestructible, hideous brute of a man expends everything in order to avenge the death of a woman who has shown him a tiny bit of affectionate attention.  Clive Owen plays a man who struggles not merely for one woman but for a whole group of women.  Who said that chivalry is dead?<br /><br />Notice that I have gotten this far without saying anything about the technical innovations of the film.  Most will know that SIN CITY was primarily filmed by actors in front of green screens, with all of the backgrounds added through CGI.  SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW did this, though Rodriguez went so far as even to use digital cameras for the actors.  Some reviewers without having seen the film (look at a couple of the earliest reviewers here on Amazon, reviewers who clearly haven't seen the film) are so bothered by this that they automatically dismiss the film.  In fact, Rodriguez uses the CGI with great virtuosity, always using it to enhance and devolve the story, never to call attention to itself.  The CGI does give the stories much of the feel that one gets reading a comic, such as when Marv attacks two would-be hit men, shoving one into a brick wall, causing an indentation in it.  Unlike SKY CAPTAIN, however, the focus was always on the story and the characters, and not on the CGI.  The distribution company (Rodriguez is essentially his own studio, he and his wife operating on their own in Austin, Texas) complained about the film being in black and white, but it was a perfect choice.  There is a considerable amount of colorization, most of it to great effect.  For instance, in the opening sequence, a man is talking to a woman and mentions her eyes, and at the word \\"eyes\\" they go from black and white to a subtle green.<br /><br />I honestly feel that this film represents a turning point in several ways.  First, it might represent the complete shift from Robert Rodriguez from promising director to a full-fledged master.  Second, it could be the film that provides the model for all that follow in the correct use of CGI.  Third, it could serve as the pattern for future adaptations for the filming of graphic novels.

B00006L90T|5.0|One of the best things about Carnival of Souls is the way the sound and music create the film's atmosphere.  The first organ chords that open the film with shots of the river's murky surface foreshadow a later diegetic appearance of the same music.  The magnified sound of the boards of the fateful wooden bridge ratchet up the eeriness of the mood, and echo the distorted sound of Mary Henry's footsteps when, toward the end, in her last terrified flight through the town, the clacking of her heels on the street takes on a strange and unreal rhythm.<br /><br />After the accident, we see Mary Henry from above, from the point of view of the crowd on the bridge.  She crawls out of the muddy water where the police have been dragging for the car, which had earlier plunged from the bridge.  This is the first of many times that she is viewed from an overhead angle.  The second time we see her from such a height is at the organ manufacturing warehouse, from the balcony where several of the workers, lured away from their various jobs as if hypnotized by her music, have gathered to see her practicing.  In this scene we learn that she is leaving for Salt Lake City to take a job as a church organist.  The installation supervisor wishes her luck, and tells her: Put your soul into it a little OK? (Spot the low-budget dialog, OK...?)<br /><br />An interesting sound device occurs next in the car, en route to Salt Lake City.  We discover that the music we hear is not coming from the radio as we had thought, because as she turns the dials, nothing happens.  The source of the music appears puzzling to her as well.  Hilligoss is stunning here - crazy-eyed, her face in ECU lit by otherworldly light.<br /><br /> The film was made in 1962, and so we never see a pack of Marlboros or a can of Pepsi.  But when Mary Henry arrives at the rooming house in Salt Lake City and we meet the landlady, Mrs. Thomas, she happens to be carrying a can of Ajax - quite amusing!<br /><br />Most of the scenes are tense as Mary is often in claustrophobic spaces: inside her car, or with the cloying Mr. Linden, the neighbor, who continually forces into her space with his hands, face, and body.  Later, the minister too crowds her in the blocked area behind the organ.  The first peaceful scene is the one where she first visits the abandoned fairground, which inexplicably draws her.  Again we see her from high above when she enters the pavilion.<br /><br />Probably the most important scene in the film occurs when Mary visits the empty church to practice.  She starts out with all the correct organ music, pauses to look at her hands as if they don't belong to her, and resumes.  But now the music changes.  It becomes the haunted carnivalesque score building on what we'd heard briefly in the opening scene.  Gene Moore is credited with the music, and it's superb!  Has anything been written anywhere about this?  (Did it influence the opening of Led Zeppelin's \\"Your Time is Gonna Come\\"?)  She's become one with the organ, and we see her bare feet floating over the pedals, rows of choir robes shiver disembodied on their hangers, we see images of clouds over the moon then reflected in the water, saints frozen in the stained glass, and dancers in the pavilion in compressed time.  I think this is really an amazing cinematic moment!  It ends when the minister bursts on this scene, horrified.  He's heard all this, and shrieks: Profane! Sacrilege! He blurts out that he pities her for her \\"lack of soul\\" and instantly banishes her from the church, firing her from her job as church organist forever.<br /><br />There is a particularly sublime shot in the film to watch for. It occurs in the scene of Mary Henry's final visit to the pavilion.  There is a long shot of the ballroom dancers in the dark pavilion, embracing and motionless, entangled with the long dangling streamers.  This is count one.  Counts two, three, and four occur like this: the strings of lights illuminate, the music starts, and thedancers begin.  The lights, the music, and the motion occur with a cadence so deliberate and careful as though counted out by metronome, and as if to suggest that everything will happen in order, as it should.  No need to hurry, no need to run.  This time we see Mary from a low angle, the sky behind her instead of the ground.ncers begin.

B0000C8AUO|3.0|Despite the relative blandness throughout the album, there are some memorable songs, worth adding to any Bowie enthusiast's list. At times there's over-production and songs going on cruise control, but there's also that typical Bowie unpredictability that any fan (or music enthusiast in general), would appreciate. <br /> <br />The Bonus Disc is worth it only for \\"Fly\\", which sounds like something that was left out of the \\"Heathen\\" sessions. Fantastic track, what I would consider one of his modern \\"classics\\". I've never been a huge fan of the song \\"Rebel Rebel\\", so I'm biased as far as that goes, suffice it to say that it's the studio version of the live version, heh. <br /> <br />Overall an interesting album. I really liked the general style and direction he was heading, and it worked best with Pablo Picasso, The Loneliest Guy, Try Some Buy Some, New Killer Star, Days, Bring Me the Disco King, and oddly enough Fly. That's pretty good for an album these days, where more than half of the tracks are worthwhile. Not a good album to introduce yourself (or someone else) to Bowie, but a good one after you've heard his more essential albums (i.e. Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, Space Oddity, Station to Station, Heroes, etc.).
B00005JNTV|5.0|Sin City is the first movie of 2005 to actually get excited about; it follows the source material 99.9%(which is astounding for it's extremely violent content).  I've heard comparisons  ranging from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars but really the film stands all on its own.  An amazing and altogether unique moviegoing experience that reawakens us to the incredible possibilities of film.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that we have Robert Rodriguez (and of course, Frank Miller) to thank for this.  The guy knows how to make movies like no other.  I was impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's fanboy fueled Hellboy last year and with Sin City we get an equally impressive and awe inspiring realization of an underground comic brought vividly, and brutally, to life.<br /><br />Sin City is comprised of three books, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard.  I could almost swear that for some minor deviances due to film constraints and the insecurities of Jessica Alba (really, it wouldn't have killed you to be topless as Nancy the stripper for cryin' outloud!) the movie is a frame for frame reenactment of the comics.  It helps to have read the books first, just to fully understand what is being done.<br /><br />In 1990 Warren Beatty did a superb job of bringing Dick Tracy to the screen and now, in 2005 we have Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wholly deserving of praise for their new noir masterpiece.  It's visceral, it's raw, and it's entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />The casting is top notch, Bruce Willis as Hartigan; the truly underappreciated Mickey Rourke as Marv; Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Nick Stahl, Brittany Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe-they all do fine jobs.  But it's Benicio Del Toro who has the standout part as Jackie Boy.  He's funny, vicious, and unsettling all at the same time.<br /><br />If you're looking for hard boiled, white knuckle action with insane violence (we're talking gleeful overkill here) look no further than Sin City.  The first must see movie of 2005 and a beacon of hope for the future of film.  I'm hoping this makes a killing at the ol' box office because there are more Sin City books ready and waiting for the big screen.e of 2005 and a beacon of hope for the future of film.

What In the name of Dog were you thinking George?...that after 20 years we not only got younger, but dumber too? Well apparently some of us did, I saw some 4 & 5 star reviews out there,Yeah & WWF Big-Time Wrestling is for real. <br />When Released on tape, I wasted a couple bucks renting it, with a glimmer of hope (knowing georgie is buddies with that other over-rated P.O.S. director Steven \\"The Terminal\\" Spielberg it was just barely a glimmer) after 15 min. I couldnt take any more, Jar Jar Binx done sent me running out of the room. <br />Couple weeks ago I found a copy for a $1 at a used cd store.

B000063JDE|5.0|The elusiveness and the mystery; the violence and the surrealist  nightmares; the loneliness and the cruelty; the curiosity and the poignancy will be the crossed elements of that dreamy puzzle.<br /><br />A human ear will be the first clue in the crime scene who will lead to a couple of youngsters to make a journey to a restricted land. The slow agony of lonely singer, the abominable presence of a kidnapper drug dealer, a bunch of human specters, a bit of amylic anhidride and a bitter portrait of an agonic world will make of this picture a real cult movie that grows and grows through the years.<br /><br />David Lynch confessed in a interview that four crucial sequences were inspired by his personal dreams. So, that' s why I respect so much  Lynch ' s aesthetics, he is one the genuine descendent of that so far German Expressionism Movement being Murnau, Fritz Lang, Robert Wiene, Paul Wengerer and King Vidor his more excel  ambassadors. So in my personal opinion I recommend you to take a ride by those important and decisive years to find the visual clues, the body language and the imagination force and then back to Lynch. Otherwise you may misunderstand or worst still underrate the underground labyrinths, fundamental trademark  of this original and innovative creator.
1400032717|5.0|Much has been written about this marvelous novel, written from the perspective of an autistic savant.  While I had difficulty understanding the novel's complex mathematics, I realized that I was not meant to solve these problems.  Rather, I was meant to comprehend the life of a boy who is unable to filter and resolve all of the information that the human mind routinely processes and who must come to terms with the harrowing ordeal of the outside world, and in particular, the stark realities of his dysfunctional parents.  From its beginning, this novel immediately engages the reader and it does not disappoint.
B0006213WG|4.0|Yah, they copied some stuff from other bands.  Which, doesn't particularly please me... I'll be honest it can kind of make you angry.  But look at it this way...  It just so happens that the majority of stuff on here thats the best is the stuff that they truely were original on.  It's not like their getting praise for their.... um.... \\"unoriginal moments\\".  And I like their new \\"more serious\\" side.  You can get lost in their music more... and admitedly this album beats the ass out of most of the songs on All Killer No Filler.  It's still a really good album.  I give it a 4 because of the unoriginality on the certain songs. <br /> <br />(and i dont think the unoriginality was intentional... things get stuck in your head sometimes... probly didnt even notice they were copying during the song creation process... but they're probly beating theirselves 4 it now.  Or maybe I'm wrong and they're all sitting there shuffling through modern music and deciding what to recreate for their next album.  Who knows.)
038572179X|4.0|Briony Tallis is a young English girl with a flair for the dramatic.  She writes a play which she plans to produce for the homecoming of her older brother Leon, with the help of her cousins as cast members.  Things go awry and the play is never put on, but a drama of a bigger sort takes place instead.  Briony is the witness of two events between adults at her home, and her young age and impressionable nature keep her from interpreting the events correctly.  She claims to have seen someone committing a crime, which causes him to be sent to jail, although he is completely innocent.  The book then switches to graphic scenes of wartime, as Briony searches for atonement for her crime.  Through beautiful prose and wonderful character development, the author spins a tale which explores the possibilities of forgiveness, and the terrific responsibilities of writers whose words will invariably influence the thoughts and attitudes of others.  This book is not for everyone.  Be advised that the narrative moves slowly and it's not until the very end that issues are resolved.  For me, the book was enjoyable and the brilliant ending justified the slow pace of the story.

B0001Z53AQ|3.0|Eminem took a (nearly) two year break from rapping in 2003-2004 to produce artists for the Shady/Aftermath label. The biggest success came from 50 Cent, of course, and his G-Unit group followed (as well as solo albums by Young Buck and Lloyd Banks). In between, he also found time to reunite with D12. Do you remember D12? they appeared in Summer 2001 with the \\"Devil's Night\\" LP and the single \\"Purple Pills\\". I did not much care for that album at all; everything about seemed to be shallow and unmemorable (especially when compared to Eminem's own \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\"). It basically seemed like filler to satisfy fans til \\"The Eminem Show\\". Three years later, they have released \\"D12 World\\"; a big improvement on their debut, but it still doesn't fully succeed. Despite a VERY good first single, most of the album is nothing more than \\"ear candy\\". It's fun to listen to while it last, but fades from memory right after. The good first single and it's lesser follow-up: <br />- \\"My Band\\" B+. I normally deplore D12, but this song is original, clever, fairly intelligent and, most of all, funny. It has a good flow, is biting with humor, and gives us a feeling that it is accuarate. All six members get their spots to shine on this track and keep it consistantly entertaining through out. <br />- \\"How Come\\" C+. Yes, it is far more relevant than most of the group's work, but it doesn't have the impact that it should. Much of the song seems to be mimicing Eminem's deeper works (i.e. \\"Stan\\" and \\"Sing For The Moment\\"). The needs more life and originality to stand out on it's own. <br />There are a few other enjoyable tracks: \\"Loyalty\\" (feat. Obie Trice) is a tough, street wise rap song that expresses D12's menacing side and flows fairly well. \\"Get My Gun\\" has no depth what so ever, but is very catchy and has some strange charms to make it work despite it's \\"envelope pushing\\" content. It is not alone in that category; \\"Just Like U\\" and \\"Bitch\\" push the envelope as well, but they seem to be made for that purpose only. Also worthy of mention are \\"American Psycho 2\\"; a Dr. Dre production that enters some Mobb Deep territory, and \\"D12 World\\"; produced by the overrated Kanye West, which seemes to be going against everything he \\"preaches\\" about. <br />Bottom Line: **1/2. The album is a fun little time killer, but just isn't worth our $15 to buy. With the exception of \\"My Band\\", the rest doesn't quite live up to the standards Eminem has set. There were MUCH better rap choices in 2004; including Jay-Z, the Black Eyed Peas, Nelly, Luadcris and Ciara. With those other options out there for your dollars, this is something you borrow from a friend.
0156027321|4.0|A friend insisted that I read this novel, and I was not disappointed.  In fact, I was spellbound by the plot and the writer's craft.  I willingly suspended disbelief and latched on to Pi's nightmarish journey as a testament to man's ability to hope, survive and prevail.  The writer's relentless and excruciating descriptions of this journey border on the surreal or the hyper-real, and that is my sole criticism.  The novel is sensational in all senses of the word, and perhaps gratuitous in its detailed depictions of such things as tiger turd and the agonizing deaths of animals aboard the life boat.  Nevertheless, the novel succeeds in capturing the reader's attention and more importantly, in making its statement of divine intervention in the presence of unspeakable horror.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Pretty much as good as it gets these days considering all the junk you here on the radio and MTV these days.  Haven't heard too many new bands that put out something this good.  All the songs are terribly good.  That's right sir, these fools crazy.  Hhhmmmmmmm!
B0007OCG4W|2.0|Out of several hundred movies that I've reviewed, I can count the unadulterated duds on one hand. \\"Closer\\" is the latest addition to this select group of utter cinematic failures. It's based on a Broadway play written by Patrick Marber, who also wrote the screenplay. And the writing is atrocious. This is a \\"relationship movie\\". It's about two couples: Alice and Dan, Anna and Larry. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a young American in London. She and Dan (Jude Law) meet when Alice looks the wrong way when crossing a street and is hit by a car. After he has been with Alice for a year, Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a portrait photographer who is also American. Anna rejects him. So Dan poses as Anna on an internet sex chat site and sets Anna up with Larry (Clive Owen), a sleazebag doctor, without her knowing it. But Anna and Larry hit it off and become a couple. A year later, Dan is still with Alice but preoccupied with Anna. So change your partners, dosey-doe. But that's not the end of it. Unfortunately.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed about \\"Closer\\" is that it's contrived to the point of being corny. The second thing I noticed is that I didn't know anyone's name. The characters have protracted conversations with strangers without introducing themselves. We get the first name 10 minutes into the film. By this point, it's a relief. I presume \\"Closer\\" is supposed to be about how and why people love one another, but it is a hypothetical exploration of that subject. Real people don't act or speak like these characters, and there is no indication of why the characters care for one another. In fact, they really don't seem to. The idea that any of the characters are in love is preposterous.<br /><br />The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. It feels like a play. A bad play. Characters constantly make nonsensical proclamations, like \\"I couldn't lie to you....because I love you.\\" Every conversation is ponderous. The writing is so bad that sometimes one character has to articulate what another is feeling. Larry is a thoroughly obnoxious person who lives for conquest. Dan is a romantic. Both men are uncommonly self-absorbed. Anna is guilt-ridden. Alice is supposed to be an enigma, but she's just childlike. Anna and Larry both seem emotionally ill, so I have to agree with Larry that they belong together. All four of them have a pathological desire to know everything about their partners, which they spend most of their time pursuing. At one point Dan says, \\"Please tell me the truth....because I'm addicted to it.\\" Yup. Their lives would be a lot easier if these people discovered the concept of discretion.<br /><br />I can't say \\"Closer\\" is all bad. It really depends upon your sense of humor. The dialogue is unintentionally funny from the start. If you last long enough, there is one interminable conversation between Larry and Alice in a strip club that is absolutely hilarious. You'll laugh out loud when Dan breaks down in tears. That's notable for being the nadir of Jude Law's career. Truthfully, Clive Owen's performance is good, but his character is nonsense. The other three performances are flat. They could scarcely be otherwise. So I don't recommend the film. But if you approach \\"Closer\\" with wry humor and lots of popcorn, you might find something in it.<br /><br />The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005 release): There is a music video for \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", performed by Damien Rice, which is the song that plays over the closing credits.

The dialogue is unintentionally funny from the start. If you last long enough, there is one interminable conversation between Larry and Alice in a strip club that is absolutely hilarious. You'll laugh out loud when Dan breaks down in tears. That's notable for being the nadir of Jude Law's career. Truthfully, Clive Owen's performance is good, but his character is nonsense. The other three performances are flat. They could scarcely be otherwise. So I don't recommend the film. But if you approach \\"Closer\\" with wry humor and lots of popcorn, you might find something in it. <br /> <br />The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005 release): There is a music video for \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", performed by Damien Rice, which is the song that plays over the closing credits.  Subtitles are available for the film in English and French. Dubbing is available in French.
0385513755|3.0|There is no doubt that this is a good read - fast paced with intrigue and lots of red herrings. However, I cannot understand why it has attained cult status and why so many people want to &quot;believe&quot;. Knowing even a little about history and a little critical thinking will put this novel where it belongs, strictly in the realm of fiction. Enjoy it for what it is. Don't read into it any more than a good story.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I have to admit I did not give this one enough listens when I first got it and initially rated it one star. Believe it or not I have actually felt compelled to edit my review and properly rate it 5 stars. This album kicks some major ass and I like the fact that it seems more unique to me than Brave New World (also excellent). The production takes some getting used too and it is a dirtier sound and possibly over compressed yet it doesn't hurt my ears and it sounds great on nice headphones. I really cannot even fathom why I would have rated this so low. I see complaints that you cannot hear Bruce, and that is a head scratcher!!!?? He comes through loud and clear. Guitars sound incredible too although they are a bit muddy in parts. Really no complaints at all on the production other than the fact that it obviously could have been mastered slightly better. It may not stand with the 80's classics but I am thankful Maiden was still releasing stuff like this at the time. Outstanding great effort! My favorite tracks are the title cut, No More Lies (classic Maiden), and the epic Paschendale. Really probably more like 4.5 stars compared to the all time masterpiece classics of the 80's but still necessary in your collection.
0452282152|3.0|This well-written novel is good historical fiction.  It places the reader in the time of Vermeer, and one believes that the speech, atmosphere and rituals of that time have been accurately rendered.  The characters are interesting, but they lack fire and resolve.  I had the gnawing feeling that I was reading a Dutch travelogue.  Not at all compelling.
B0002858YS|5.0|I've been waiting for a rock band that makes me want to listen to them over,and over. I mean I just can't stop listening to (The killers)it's so addicting! and listening to this music makes me think, (has Brandon ever had a girl friend?)he talks about us girls a lot, in most of his songs. <br /> <br />(I'm not saying he's desprate or any thing). <br /> <br />I love the killers. Well mostly BRANDON but he is known for best dressed and sexiest man.  <br /> <br />PLUS I think any body will like the killers. THEY ROCK MAN! JUST BUY THE CD. LIKE I SAID (THEY ROCK).   <br />                                         -ANAI S  It's pernounced on-a-e  <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|You have Julia Roberts here as a photographer.  Enter Jude Law (who is involved with Natalie Portman's character)who as he's being photographed and conversating with her forms an intense crush on her and is determined to have her.  His girlfriend (Portman) comes in, senses something is amiss, but cannot do anything about it.  Movie skips ahead (not confusingly) and we find a lot more about each of these characters, including Julia Roberts being together with Clive Owen.  That doesn't stop her from indulging in a relationship with Jude Law the whole time.  The two of them are no match for the ruthless and I mean ruthless vengence Clive Owen takes on them all.  Some of the vengence involves him seeking out Portman and the two of them had the sort of coldness in their personalities that made it work.  Strangely, I didn't feel sorry for any of these people at the end, personally I found each of them (even Roberts) to be resigned to their choices.  Incredibly selfish , beautiful people who screw with each others minds and rationalize it to fit their purposes.
0679428895|3.0|I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, but this book fell short of the expectations I had, having read a couple of Harris' other books. I can compare it to the movie \\"Titanic\\": the details of the disaster where gripping and very realistic. But to get there, the reader/viewer is asked to trudge through the development of a story and characters that doesn't live up to the end. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the information about the aqueducts and Pliny the Elder. That of the aqueducts is probably very accurate, based on the ruins we still have available for inspection and study. That of Pliny is probably a little less reliable, but interesting and genuine-looking enough for me. The rest of the characters I thought were predictable and perhaps too stereotypical. <br /> <br />The scenes of the disaster were rendered even more vividly for me as I thought of those scenes of 9/11 when we could see those terrible images of people walking around in a daze or running in panic in the dust that made it seem like nighttime at 10 o'clock in the morning. Having seen enough TV shows about the ruins of Pompeii and the figures of humans found in their death poses makes the book very interesting and helpful in understanding what happened. <br /> <br />It is a relatively short book (274 pages) and it does read very quickly. So if the reader is flustered with the story leading to the eruption, I recommend sticking it out till the worthy end.
B00000720W|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST AND LEGENDARY BLACK METAL ABLUM YOU CAN FIND. THIS IS NECRO BLACK METAL NOT DEATH METAL. ONLY FOR THE DEVOLTED FEW.
B00068IOWC|3.0|When I bought this and saw that it was produced by Steve Lillywhite I thought that it would have a rawer sound, like their first three albums did.  However, I think this album suffers because there's just too much going on in each track.  They really need to get back to just guitar/bass/drums.  The album just sounds too produced.  There are some good tracks.  \\"Vertigo\\" is okay, although the lyrics could be better.  \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" are highlights.  \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\" is good, but overproduced.  \\"All Because Of You\\" is another highlight and has the sound that this whole album should have had.  The other tracks just fall flat.  This album would have been better if Eno and Lanois would have produced it.
0553275569|5.0|This book accurately documents the Space Race between the U.S. and Russia. Im so happy Thomas Wolfe wrote this book because i never would have known that these events had happened this way. There is a lot to learn about the way space programs worked and the details and hardships these people endured. I was thoroughly intrigued by the way the sound barrier was broken and the skill it takes to fly airplanes at such high altitudes and velocities. The way the men trying to explore space believed in the programs was truly an inspiration to me. Up until this time, space travel seemed like such an impossible task, but after these accomplishments, the universe seemed just a tiny bit smaller. The way Wolfe displays the perserverence of the men inspires me everyday and I hope that it helps me to do something incredible one day as well.
B000002INR|3.0|I know why this album is the top glam metal album of the 80's, it rocks!! great debut album with a raw sound. Every song is worth listening to..if this record is not in your collection, I highly recommend it to be.
B000002KDO|5.0|While Black Sabbath's first two albums are incredible testaments of early heavy metal, I think \\"Master of Reality\\" is the album where they really showed what they had to offer.  This disc really is mandatory listening for anyone interested in metal.  I'm sure that most people start out with \\"Paranoid,\\" which is great (especially \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Hand of Doom\\"), but \\"Master of Reality\\" is full of so much great material, that anyone whose Black Sabbath collection is missing it is doing themselves a great disservice. <br /> <br />As a sidenote...looking at reviews for newer albums, I see a lot of reviewers making statements like \\"Well, half the album is good and these days that's saying a lot, so...4 stars.\\"  While I agree with that statement, it's sad.  I mean, you look at some albums from 20-30 years ago (like this one), and you can't find anything wrong with them.  Black Sabbath's first three albums are absolutely, completely flawless, but these days most fans are content with an overlong 15-track CD where half of the songs are at least decent.  Let's bring back the proper album, not just a collection of songs.
B00004XOWM|1.0|this band sux badly i can't believe that crap is still coming from them i would rather shoot my self then listen to that crap <br />too bad i had to give this crap one star
B0007OCG4W|4.0|i watched this movie with great anticipation questions whirling in my head from readings of recent reviews.will the language shock me?no.will the premise shock me?no.these things are what they are in a movie representing love in a brutal dark form.the story really is no story but a tale of two men and two women whose lives become intersected then intwined when in the most random of incidents it is a tale of dan(law)who is drawn to alice(portman)when she is hit by a car and he takes her to the hospital.She is a free spirited youth with cool one liners and deep insight,she is a breath of fresh air for dan,at least i thought.dan writes a book about alice and during his photo shoot for the book,he meets photographer anna(roberts) who is divorcing and is immediatly drawn to her.After a brief session where she also photgraphs alice she decides not to pursue dan and he in turn impersonates her on the internet chat room and there he meets larry(owen)who then meets the real anna and they marry.anna and dan cannot resist temptation how ever and continue a affair that comes to light when hey tell their respective partners.then it becomes a tale of hurt and redemption with things never tied in a neat package.the language though harsh was what i had expected in the heated arguements that where excahnged when you are hurt and enraged things happen and words happen.when people want details they want the \\"gore\\" so that to me was a very realistic protrayal.i was less then pleased with the end but over all enjoyed this movie it was very mature and thoughtfully acted even though i can see where it could be boring to some,and others like me intriguing
B00008OLIO|4.0|This is by far one of the best rock albums of all time, and one of the best debut albums of all time. From the great voice of Vince Neil to the outstanding guitar solos, nothing but classic. This is a classic album and after 24 years it's still on top. Mick Mars is one of the best and he's also underrated.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|stoner rock is great, although it is almost non-existent today, fine with me, i got all my kyuss and qotsa albums to feed my need for the desert blues!!! i heard the whole album, and must say that it will go down as another classic QOTSA albums. and its even better than songs for the dead, since it doesnt have those radio interruptions, which i sucessfully edited out with an mp3 editor.  <br />-i suggest getting your hands on; QOTSA self titles album, rated R, songs for the dead and to see where QOTSA came from, get yourself best of Kyuss album, where josh holmes was the lead guitars, and u will see that he pretty much keeps the same style on almost everything he lays his hands on.  <br />-desert sessions is also quite interesting glimpse of crazy rocknroll, since they record a whole album in less than a month, 9and10 were recorded in like a week or so.  <br />-what happened to nick? he was a craziest drug induced bassist -right next to nicky sixx
B000062YAZ|5.0|i got a lot of respect for slyer being the one of the only true <br />thrash metal bands around [unlike metallica,sellouts!] i hope <br />they release another album soon  lots of respect to the real guys
B0002IQJUK|5.0|ok so i just bought this 2 disc cd just a couple of weeks ago and it hasn't left my cd player yet!!! Gavin has an amazing raw talent that has lack in the recent up coming artist.  He had an soulful voice and deep lyrics.  I personally love the acoustic or stripped cd because i think it really shows his talent.  i definitely recommend this cd because it's very great!!!!
B00005JNSK|5.0|First of all, this isn't going to be a \\"remake\\", it's going to be Burton's take on Wonka, and it will stick closer to Roald Dahl's book, which I loved to death.  Johnny Depp has been my favorite actor for the past year or so, I only just got into him late last year.  I've seen 13 of his films, and he's about the most versatile actor out there!  This is going to be a winner!
B00006G8HX|3.0|Leonard Nemoy's Star Trek directorial debut succeeds in two vital areas:  A)It's extremely well-paced and B)There's quite a bit of good humor in it.  The story takes place right after Khan's wrath and involves Kirk's starship-jacking of the Enterprise to go look for Spock's body to unite with his mind which in imprinted in McCoy's cranium.  The problem is Spock's body landed on the newly created and recently doomed planet of Genesis.  As luck would have it, a group of ambitious Klingons, led by Christopher Lloyd, want the information to make their own Genesis and go after the research vessel, which is inhabited by Kirk's son and the newly made-over Lt. Saavik, orbiting the planet for the information.   <br /> <br />This is just good ol' fashioned Star Trek minus great space battles of the last installment.  Lloyd makes an admirable and funny adversary, surprisingly almost as good as Ricardo Montalban's Khan but not as memorable.  That's probably how you could sum up all of 'The Search for Spock': almost as good as Khan, but not as memorable.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|There is a difference to me between making a film with relationships connecting in different ways because it's logical and that's where it would most likely go, while others look like it was written just simply to see it happen. Closer is one of those films that halfway through you just ask \\"why am I watching this anyway?\\" <br /> <br />Dan and Alice catch each other's eyes walking on the street in London. But Alice's unknowing of England's traffic direction gets her hit by a taxi. And so a relationship blooms. Months later(or years it's never mentioned), he decides to write a book about Alice's escapades(she's a former stripper). While being photographed for the book jacket, he lusts after the photographer Anna but she rejects him. In a weird way to take revenge he impersonates her in an online sex room(probably the funniest but awkwardest scenes I've seen) and wants to meet. Imagine the shock that the real Anna actually shows up and they get married. <br /> <br />And basically the film is a big series of turnabouts. When the characters are with the one they love, they long for the one they really love. And so basically each man has sex with each woman and it's basically like a big orgy with none of the other characters participating. You just wonder \\"can't you 4 just move in together and sleep with whoever?\\" <br /> <br />To me the 2 better performances are Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. He comes across as a kind of cold-hearted man but just really direct and forward and emotional but in a more menacing way. She plays her character as someone who justs wants things to work out but things just get in the way. In the Professional(or Leon in some cases) she played a young almost Lolita type while here it's almost full blown but there's still this aura of innocence with Natalie that makes her character a bit tragic.  <br /> <br />Jude Law almost looks like he's sleepwalking through the film and Julia Roberts looks quite miscast. Her character calls for her to be a bitdetached about all the wrongdoings that she does, an almost who cares attitude but she doesn't come across that well. <br /> <br />If you're in a \\"that b****/***hole broke my heart\\" mood, this film's perfect but taken generally, it's kind of unneccesary, if only to watch Natalie in a stripper role(no guys, she does not show anything, sorry).
B00000IMTF|4.0|Ritchie Blackmore + Ronnie James Dio + Cozy Powell! I'm sure you already knew that would be a classic! Ritchie Blackmore had just left Deep Purple when he teamed up with Ronnie! Ronnie had yet to go on to join Black Sabbath and later form his own band. The addition of Cozy Powell on drums made this seem like one hell of an idea, and they sure did pull it off well! <br /> <br />Ritchie Blackmore changed up his guitar style a little bit from what he had going on Deep Purple's albums. His guitar work sound a little more smooth (if that makes any sense to you). With the Purples he had pretty much the simple sound, but here he opens it up a little and shows us that he can play a little different. This is Rainbow's second album and is certainly better than \\"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\\". Ronnie James Dio gives a stellar (as usual) performance on vocals, a performance that I only think he beat in his \\"Holy Diver\\" album. Hen has that sound wel all love, that Ronnie sound that we can't get enough of! Cozy Powell gives a good (but not his best ever) drum performance. I own the old vinyl copy of this album and on it you can't really hear Jimmy Bain's bass. I don't know what the CD version sounds like or if there is a remaster but the production value of this album is that great! I believe Tony Carey did the keyboard on this album and by god he did it well. Some of his intro riffs are so good, that they make the song seem awesome before it even gets going. This album has an overall mystical, almost spooky sound. Kind of like Black Sabbath with a little twist. <br /> <br />The songs on here are all gems. The highlights being \\"Stargazer\\" \\"Starstruck\\" and \\"Run with the Wolf\\". The weakest song, I found was \\"Do you Close Your Eyes\\". It wasn't bad, it just wasn't \\"Stargazer\\". This is my favourite Rainbow album. It is much better than their debut and a little better than \\"Long Live Rock N Roll\\". I highly reccomned this album to anyone into prog metal, metal in general or rock music ingeneral!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Inspired by Cameron Crowe's real-life journeys and writings of some of rock and roll's biggest names(at least during the 70's anyways), the film is a kind of autobiographical-but-sort of telling of a boy becoming a man in probably the most un-innocent way a boy can. <br /> <br />William Miller is an aspiring journalist who writes for some magazines, notably Creem. He meets Lester Bangs, a legendary critic/journalist who warns him of rock stars. He gives him an assignment to do a writing on a Black Sabbath concert and get an interview but he's not allowed backstage. Until up-and-coming band Stillwater decides to bring him in. He becomes so well-liked that Rolling Stone offers to send him on tour with the band and do a piece on them. And so the journey begins. <br /> <br />With a largely 60's-70's soundtrack and many classic scenes, it's kind of hard not to like the film. The director's cut fleshes things out even more with more development into the characters, in particular band aid(don't call her a groupie) Penny Lane. <br /> <br />While Kate Hudson is a nice find(not to mention cute), it's Billy Crudup to me who makes the better performance. Flawed, funny, and weirdly likable. Patrick Fugit is good in some scenes but other scenes it's almost like he didn't go further than he could've. Phillip Seymour Hoffman also gives a great performance as Lester Bangs, an actual journalist. <br /> <br />Personally on a given day, I still prefer Jerry Maguire but this is probably Cameron's 2nd best film, even though it's obviously his most personal.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I have bought 2 CDs in my life (quite an accomplishment for a starving university kid), and both CDs are by Theory of a Deadman. I bought this CD as soon as it came out, and I was a bit disappointed. Not to say this isn't good, it is a rocking and extremely awesome CD, but the first one was just too damn good.  <br /> <br />In contrast to the last CD, this one feels more personal. TOAD has broadened their music style and the music is definitely heavier than the last CD. The guitar is also better on this record.  <br /> <br />Here is a review of all the tracks, and I don't give out 10s, because I think nothing is perfect (maybe a bit cynical for a 18 year old). So 9.5 is the \\"perfect\\" score. <br /> <br />1. Hating Hollywood: A good start to the album and great rock riffs. The opening riff is addictive. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />2. No Way Out: A hard rocking song and has a fast pace. The song gets better as it goes along. 8/10 <br /> <br />3. No Surprises: The first single from the CD. When I first heard it, it was a pleasant surprise. It is a good song and gets even better after listening to it more. This is a song written before TOAD became famous (I remember hearing this on the CFOX), so it is nice to get a glimpse of the style before they got famous. Good lyrics too. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Quiver: A good rock song. Not much to say about it other than it is fast and some strong lyrics for TOAD. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. Santa Monica: A change of pace from the previous songs. The only song to contain the name of the album \\"gasoline\\". Very good chorus. Reminds me of \\"Make up Your Mind\\", with a melancholy tone that is prevalent through out the album. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. Better Off: Faster than the previous track. Reminds me of a mix of \\"Leg to Stand On\\" and \\"What You Deserve\\" from the last CD. <br /> <br />7. Say Goodbye: Excellent. Feels like a mix of \\"The Last Song\\" and \\"Say I'm Sorry\\", but it's a totally different song. Wonderful acoustic guitar at first and awesome lyrics. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />8. Hello Lonely: Not sure if it's a coincidence, but the best tracks in both TOAD albums are songs 7 and 8. A soft acoustic start to the song, and a smooth transition through out the song. The pre-chorus is the best part of this song. I also love the lyrics. The lyrics in the last and this song epitomizes the tone throughout the album. Another \\"perfect\\" score. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />9. Me and My Girl: Another awesome song. This one is faster than the last two songs. There is a nice twist in the lyrics. I also like the background guitar riffs, and the banjo-sounding part is great. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Since You've Been Gone: A mellow song, and has a popish feel to it. An easy song to play in that it is mostly chord strumming. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />11. Hell just Ain't the Same: The only song written by Tyler Connolly. Not a song in that it is only about a minute long. Has a southern feel to it. 8/10 <br /> <br />12. Save the Best for Last: Judging the title, it should be the last song of the album (same thing for \\"The Last Song\\"). A fast song and a lot of riffs. 8/10 <br /> <br />13. In the Middle: A soft and slower song with an acoustic start, similar to \\"Since You've Been Gone\\". 8.5/10 <br /> <br />There you go, my first review of any sort. I haven't wrote this  much since the last English 112 essay. Give yourself a hand for reading this much. Overall it is an awesome album, and that \\"disappointed\\" thing at the beginning of this review is just my initial personal view. I give \\"Gasoline\\" an outstanding 9/10, and it is an album definitely worth picking (plus it's cheaper than others).
0783219695|5.0|It's a question that probably enters a lot of director's minds when they film a movie based on a true story: how do you make it exciting and interesting even when we know the results of the real event? Yes the astronauts do survive, although one died several years later but still the movie manages to be thrilling.<br /><br />Late 1960's, everyone was in awe as NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, blowing people's minds that we could do that and also satisfied that America was there first before Russia. However, that awe is starting to wane so when the Apollo 13 mission is announced, it's almost not even worth a mention.<br /><br />Early 70's, Apollo 13 takes off and everything's fine until an explosion cripples the shuttle seriously and the crew have to fight to stay alive while the ground crew fight to figure out a way to bring them home with very little power. Helping out the ground crew is Ken Mattingly, the former pilot who was ousted for Jack Swigert days before launch for medical reasons.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes in the film and probably a good indicator of what the film can do, is when the crew fires it's engines in hopes to pick up some speed and return home quicker. They take a simple idea of keeping the Earth in a window and make it quite exciting. And it's what the film does best: it takes the simplest things or the most well-known event and makes it suspenseful, almost making you forget they'll be fine.<br /><br />The human drama scenes are nicely played but it's the suspense scenes and the neat-as-hell space shots of the shuttle that look the most impressive but still the film is a good watch.
0743454529|4.0|I am in high school and am taking a class on bioethics. This book deals with some of the biggest bioethical issues in our society today- is it moral to create a child for the sole purpose of saving another? The book is well-done in that it addresses the viewpoints of all involved parties- the sick child, the healthy child, the mother, the father, and even the lawyer and the guardian ad-litem. I liked that it wasn't strictly one person's opinion- it showed that the issue has many valid viewpoints and sides, and there are pros and cons to every choice. <br />While I loved this book, and it touched me emotionally (I did find myself crying- more than once!), I was extremely disappointed in the book's drastic ending. It was poorly done- like the author wrote this brilliant book and then just threw the ending in at 2:00 in the morning or something. It was a horrible ending, very abrupt, and completely non-related. The story is sad and thought-provoking enough- it did not need another tragedy to occur to make it better. In fact, it kind of ruined the book's effect. <br />But if you ignore the last 2 chapters, the book as a whole is an excellent one, and I'd definitely recommend it!
B00005JNTV|5.0|This is the most true to the source movie ever made. I'm sure it helped that one of the directors is a big fan of the comics and the other is the creator himself. I saw this movie at a screening last night and everyone there loved it. I didn't hear one person say anything bad about it. Even my manager, who is supposed to be staying by the phones in case anyone calls, came in to watch the movie. Normally he will watch a few minutes to see if everything is running smoothly, but he watched about half the movie. Every one should watch this movie and see what a real comic book movie should be like.

B00009L1TA|4.0|Basic was one the smartest movies written by Hollywood since a while ago. The plot was intriguing and it kept me thinking through out the movie but unfortunatly I believe that the movie was not well commercialed and released at a time when people only went to the cinema to waste their money and did not really care for the story within so for some people Basic was too complicated to understand. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes intriguing stories and wants to be kept guessing until the end.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This album is probably the most famous.  The songs are top-notch.  But for your sake, if you're not a die hard fan, I wouldn't get this.  The obscene and profanity is at an extreme.  But without this album, your mm collection would not be complete.  I highly recommend it.
0783219695|4.0|While this is \\"all new digitally remastered\\" I think most film buffs will find the picture quality a disappointment. The major change is an unnatural increase in color saturation; you could get the same effect (if you wanted to) with a minor adjustment to your TV. There do not appear to be any other \\"improvements.\\" Certainly the picture does not resemble what was seen in theaters. I find it distracting and unpleasant to look at. <br /> <br />Don't buy this release as a replacement for the older disk - In fact, you may want to specifically look for the older disk if you don't have it.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Overall, this is probably the best one of the collection.  It has hit songs such as The Beautiful People, Mean That You Fear, Tourniquet, Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Aintchrist Superstar, and last but not least, Reflecting God.  I'm not gonna write out and rate each and every song, but personally all the songs are great.  If you are new to manson, you should really start out with this one.  It will set you up for all the rest.
B0007TKH66|2.0|The Show had a great potential. The concept was bold - although not original - and it had a great time to be started at the turn of the 21st century - however - the show show lacked some basic elements.<br /><br />It lacked interesting characters. Even with a very talented performer like Scott Bakula - without a good script, it just doesn't happen. I feel sorry for Scott and have heard that he and Conner Trinneer both campaigned for a new direction for their characters.<br /><br />The first season tried its best to flesh out the intrigue but failed in the story arcs. Rick Berman and Brannon Braga killed the series by making it a REAL Soap Opera. (The only thing missing was the Sappy music!)<br /><br />The show didn't focus on characters or story at all. by the end of the second season - it was apaprent no one was watching and in fact - it was cancelled twice.<br /><br />Star Trek needs a rest from TV to gain new life and definately NEW blood onthe production side. I am said to see no new Trek, but Berman followed his legacy by killing the Movie franchise and creating \\"Nemesis\\" and \\"Insurrection\\" - thereby killing the movie Trek relm as well.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 2 at all was because of its technical achievements. It looks great and Herman Zimmerman did a great job.<br /><br />I wish it could have been better - but it was more writing and poor execution. 4-1-05
1400032717|5.0|A unique and interesting idea for a book - solving the \\"murder\\" of a neighborhood dog from the perspective of a 15-year-old autistic kid.  And what an amazing kid he is!!  You know kids like this are out there, calculating numbers with such speed and accuracy it's like they have computer in their heads.  But now I feel like I got to be inside his head and feel his fears and his child-like expectations of others.  In this day of parents pushing kids to the breaking point, it was a good reminder that we should be thankful to have \\"average\\" kids who can play with friends and can give and accept a hug from mom and dad.
B000002C25|5.0|I picked this up on the day it was released and I was not the least bit disappointed by it. I have listened to it often since then and still enjoy it.  Oasis is, of course, one of my favorite bands, and has been for over ten years. There isn't a thing wrong with Be Here Now, and it has been nit-picked alot, which it dosen't deserve.  If you enjoy the work of a particular artist, you have to let them take you where they want to go, not where you think they should go!  This album has a lot to enjoy.
B00008973Q|5.0|I remember first seeing Ran in High School back in 1986. I was enthralled by the massive battle scenes, the use of color, and of course the story. As the years have passed and massive battle scenes have come along since such as Braveheart, LOTR, Glory, and Last Samurai this still holds its own against any of those in its enormity, and there were no computer visuals used just to show how great this movie was and is at twenty years old.    When I bought the Masterworks edition a year ago I thought the movie had looked better years ago but figured with the new technology my memory had been tainted. I was able to secure a Fox Lorber DVD copy of Ran a few days ago and can now see the weakness' of the Masterworks edition.    The aspect ratio is not enough to be bothersome to me, but the color is atrocious, it almost looks animated. Complain if you will about tho older version, but the color looked much more realistic on the older Fox Lorber edition. The humid haze of Japan was removed, the colors to bright, and the overall original feel has been lost with the Masterworks edition.    This is an essential movie. If all that is available to purchase is the Masterworks edition then by all means buy it, but if you have the Fox Lorber original I would keep that. I am ditching the Masterworks now, and am enjoying the movie with the same appreciation I did twenty years ago with the alledged inferior version.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Wow. I didn't like this band at first, but after a few weeks of listening, they became one of my favorites (it seems this way with many other reviewers too). Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is one amazing cd. I heard their second cd first, maybe that makes a difference, but I don't think that they've sold out. I have their first as well, and the songs have the same style. If someone likes the first and doesn't like the second, chances are their tastes have changed, or they have only heard I'm Not Okay (I Promise), which is in my opinion, the worst song on the whole cd, (aside from Interlude which is just an interlude) because it's nothing like the other songs. If you like I'm Not Okay, get this cd now, because every song is better. If that's not reason enough to get this, check it out anyway. Just remember, it took me more than one listen to realize how much talent these guys have. The best songs are: You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison, Thank You for the Venom, The Ghost of You, Cemetary Drive, Hang 'Em High, ... Whatever, just go listen to all of it. You wont regret it. I can't wait for their next cd. Aside from this cd I also highly recommend their first one, I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Needless to say, I saw other people was obsessed with The Strokes way back when, and I poked fun at that, saying such things as \\"The Strokes are garbage! They suck! Last Night is such a crappy song! They're going to crash and burn and their not even going to get to a second album!\\" With the teasing came no actual listening to any of their songs, except of course the incredibly overplayed Last Night at random places. It was just the \\"cool thing to do\\" at the time. Hating The Strokes, that is. They were viewed as the Rock version of the degenerated Boy Band, and were hated for being \\"unoriginal\\", stupid, talentless, gimmicky, and all that stuff.    When Room on Fire came out, I heard some reviews and they said it was mediocre, so I started teasing again saying that they are losing whatever they once had and will be forgotten ina  few years time. The teasing wasn't an obsession or anything, but it was just included in the \\"bands I did not like\\". But fans such as my sister continued to play the songs ever-so-loud from her room, and little did I know that I had Soma and You Talk Way Too Much memorized by the time I got around to listening to them.     Then, months passed, and I listened to Reptilia. Over and over and over again. I still do. I didn't even like any rock songs at all back then, and yet this song was just fanatstic in every way!    A few months after, I was fantasically bored and saw a big list of The Strokes songs in the music folder. I listened to Reptilia again, but then decided \\"Well hell, why not Someday or something?\\" I listened to that to. I went through all their songs, just wondering what excellence the next song will sound like. My brother came in, said he wanted to go on, but I insisted that I listen to Under Control and Automatic Stop. By then I was just hooked! I regret not getting interested in them sooner, when people that lived around me actually liked them (now the only people I actually know that like them are my own brother and sister).So after a while, I got familiar with them and knew which song was on which album, after I listened to all of their songs. Though I loved NYC Cops, Soma, When It Started, Someday, and Trying Your Luck (not Last Night, it's pretty \\"meh\\"), I loved Room on Fire just so much more. Maybe you had to be there in the time Is This It came out, I don't know. But I just like RoF that much more.  >>>    >1  It starts out with What Ever Happened, a great song with stressed, exasperated vocals and straining guitars, and set into a slightly mellow atmosphere.    >2  Reptilia just blows you away with powerful, driving... everything. Raspy yet relieved and very memorable vocals (\\"The room is on fire, as she's fixing her hair!\\" send chills down your spine) and with chaotic yet constrained music. The drum is blunt and strong, the bridge sets up energy with a powerfully amped riff and then the great bassline settles in, and then the whole place explodes after the drums kills off the bridge. The chorus is just great, with the bass and guitar riffs still in place but now with the second guitarist wailing with a fuller and more fantastic version of the melody, unfortunately slightly in the background. And the vocals rasp even more during the chorus (\\"Our lives are changing lanes, yeah, you rammed me off the road!\\"). A work of musical genius.    >3  The next song (of course, I never listened to the songs in order, but to hell with that) is Automatic Stop. Brilliance. With a distinctive, odd (almost eerie) little guitar riff, and very nice vocals during the verse. The bridge has a memorable, simple guitar solo, which then the chorus comes into play after, with a great \\"synthy\\" guitar effect and just perfect vocals. Another one of my favourites.    >4  And then there's the 12:51 song. Surely the most \\"pop\\"ish song they came out with, this song sports the infamous super-compressed \\"keyboard\\" guitar melody that drives the song forward. But the guitar wouldn't do much if it wasn't for the highly rhythmic and melodic vocals that will most likely stick in your head, pushing you for just one more listen. The bridge in the middle is also very good, and the more heavier strumming of the other guitars in the background is a good addition. Nice short song that's an easy listen and still is very well made.     >5  And then there's You Talk Way Too Much. Sporting super lo-fi quality, memorable vocals, a highly odd guitar solo, and the main chorus, it's a good listen and surely worth it.    >6  Then there's Between Love & Hate. With good vocal work (\\"Don't worry about it, honey!\\") and a good solo, I don't really have much else to say about this one...    >7  Now onto Meet Me In The Bathroom. Sporting an excellent, simple bassline, good vocals (And we were just two ****s in lust/ Oh baby that just don't mean much), but the real focal point of the song is the two cooperative guitars, and together they create an impressive, catchy melody. Great song.    >8  And now on to that Under Control ballad you may have heard about! Starting with a few rythmic drum hits, the song continues with retro slow rock melody and vocals. The bass gets the job done, but the melody and the vocals are just fantastic. Sure enough this isn't exactly an energetic song, but that's not the point. The secondary verse is a main attraction, with still a very good melody and vocals. It ends off with \\"But I don't want to know...\\" which then everything stops with a powerful note from all instruments, which then the drum hits show up again, adn the song continues. The solo is something to keep the song going, too. Very, very good song, one of the highlights.    >9  Then here it comes with the hard-hitting The Way It Is. With an excellent drum effect reminiscent of Is This It, the guitars rock on with a simple riff. The vocals jump in a bit after with the riff finishing, and then afterwards the chorus wants to jump in too (\\"It's not your fault/ That's the way it is!\\"). A very energetic song, but not inthe way Reptilia is. Think of Hard To Explain, that should do it.    >10  Now with The End Has No End. Tricking you into thinking that it's going to be another The Way It Is in the intro, the song immediately relaxes with good guitar work and the vocals being the main centre of it all, as well as throughout the entire song. The verse ends with a very short break accompanied by drums, and then the chorus is introduced with the recognizable, great melody, and even more great, rythmic vocals, and then the chorus ends off with \\"The end has no end...\\". The solo is also nicely done, and the almost chaotic ending just makes an epic finish to the song.    >11  Then the album ends off with I Can't Win. Yet another one of my favourites, and becoming more and more so. With a good \\"Is This It\\" melody throughout the verses, and excellent, super-rhythmic vocals too that will keep you listening throughout the entire first verse. By the time it ends the seond verse comes in with more louder vocal work, and is still very good. The chorus then rolls in with a good guitar, good bass, and a little vocal effect at the end. This repeats again, but this time after the chorus ends off with one of the best sounding solo's they've ever done, right up there with NYC Cops.    >>>  And so it all wraps up in a neat little package called Room on Fire, and it certainly is. There is no real highlights ot the album because if I've listed them I would just list the enture album, as there is no real filler to be seen (if The Strokes thought a song they worked months on to be too meaningless, they would take it off immediately). But my current favourites has to be Reptilia, Under Control, and Automatic Stop.    The Strokes know how to make good music. Though many complain about Julian's raspy singing voice, it just comes with the band. You can't listen to Rammstein without the shrieking. The lyrics are a wonder to hear and most of the time impossible to fully decipher, yet still most of the time tella definite story that can be changing from person to person yet not manipulated. The actual instrumental work is mostly flawless, which comes from their perfectionist attitude. It just all comes together in a fantastic musical band.    So if you're still holding a grudge of some sort from years back, then stop being a stubborn ass.    -\\"Run Run Run! As fast as you can run while you can walk...\\"

0671027387|1.0|Most writers write about topics they know something about.  Tom Clancy writes about military weaponry and the CIA. John Grisham writes about the law and his home town of Memphis.<br /><br />Even those writers who don't know stuff know they have to sound like they do, so they hire researchers to help.  Dan Brown certainly seemed to have done the same with The Da Vinci Code. But he doesn't seem to have the slightest idea what goes on in the US Government, military, spy agencies, and NASA.  Nor does he seem to have hired that researcher.<br /><br />I'll give him this much: He certainly knows how to tell a good story. But the flow of this tale of science gone bad and political intrigue is flawed, I believe fatally, by the many jarring technical and political errors.<br /><br />Dan could claim pretty much anything he wanted in The Da Vinci Code, because most of us neither know nor care where Mary Magdeline landed on the coast of France.

B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors final album with Jim Morrison (they would go on to record two more albums as a trio), remains their masterpiece and belongs in every rock collection. From start to finish, the album is brilliant. It was the Doors at their absolute best. The Doors previous albums ranged from very good to classic, but their sixth album \\"L.A. Woman\\" was their crown jewel.<br /><br />It's common for most bands to start out playing the blues and then evolve into a musical style/idenity all their own. In this sense, the Doors sort of evolved backwards. They started out playing crazy, psychedelic music, and then ended their career playing the blues.<br /><br />\\"L.A. Woman\\" is a very bluesy album. It's not pure blues (B.B. King, Leadbelly), but it's rock tinged with blues. The band never sounded better. To be sure, the Doors albums were always terrific, but they sounded most at home with the blues. Playing blues rock brought out the best in all the Doors members. Ray Manzarek (organ) and Robby Krieger's (guitar) solos worked perfectly against a blues backdrop. Drummer John Densmore's jazzy style was also well suited for the blues.<br /><br />As for Jim Morrison...I think the Jim Morrison of 1967 was best suited to sing psychedelic acid rock. His ultra-cool swagger and showmanship was the ultimate voice for such music. But the Jim Morrison of 1971 was a much different person. In four years, Morrison aged a lifetime. In 1967, he sounded and looked 23. In 1971, he looked and sounded like an old man. It's hard to believe that the same voice that sang \\"Light My Fire\\" sang \\"Riders on the Storm\\" only four years later. On \\"L.A. Woman,\\" Morrison sounds worn and tired, but it matched the bluesy-jazzy downbeat music perfectly. Morrison's finest poetry was also in this swan song. Noting too obscure or bizarre to be found. It was his most honest, straightforward work.<br /><br />\\"L.A. Woman\\" is simply The Doors finest collection of songs. There is no filler to be found. Each song is a jewel on The Doors crown creation. From the opening \\"The Changeling,\\" to the closing \\"Riders on the Storm,\\" every song is great. Whether is be the hard rocking \\"Love Her Madly,\\" the downbeat \\"Cars His By My Window,\\" the bohemian \\"The Wasp\\" or the sublime \\"Riders on the Storm,\\" every song is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The general theme of the album seems to be the underbelly of L.A. in the early 70s. The album seems to function as a snapshot/soundtrack of that time and place. It's all about living day-to-day, strung-out, alone, not knowing when it will all end. In that sense, I take \\"LA Woman\\" to be sort of like a diary in the lives of Jim and (his wife) Pam. When you listen to this album, you can feel the longing, the desperation, the torment, the addictions, of that time and place. These songs sound lived in. When you listen to Morrison's screams in the title track, or soft-spoken baritone in \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" you get the sense that he knew it was going to end soon. \\"Riders on the Strom\\" seems to acknowledge and accept this fate.<br /><br />The Doors \\"L.A.

B000002NIW|5.0|This Album \\"Around The Fur\\" by the Deftones, i regard as their absolute best. I doubt they will ever top this truly classic CD. Classic mainly, in the genre it's in. But like the title of this review says, you really don't have to be a straight-forward fan of Nu-Metal or Alternative to get something out of this CD. It's a CD that does lean alot towards Nu-Metal and Alternative, but even so it's still a very enjoyable and pretty unique Album by all means. <br /> <br />The main thing about the Deftones, i feel, is the vocalist Chino Moreno. Many people have tried hard to sound like him, but failed. In that regard he's really very influential i think. And so is this band as a whole. But Chino Moreno totally adds so much to this music. If he left and they decided to bring in a new vocalist, i doubt it'd work. the Deftones would surely be over. Not that i think he's the greatest vocalist in the world, because i don't, i just feel he's the center of this band and i also feel he's one of the main reasons for their popularity.  <br /> <br />the Deftones are influenced by bands such as Helmet, The Cure, Killing Joke and Joy Division, just to name a few. You can almost get the Helmet influence, but as for the others it's hard to tell. That's how unique i believe the Deftones really are. I've even heard that guitarist Stephen Carpenter is a big fan of the technical, ultra-heavy death-metal band, Meshuggah..Although the Deftones sound NOTHING like them, obviously because they are in a totally different genre, it's interesting and pretty cool to see how open-minded the Deftones seem to be about music. (More so than most other Nu-Metal/Alternative bands i know of anyway..) <br /> <br />There really isn't any filler songs on this CD either. That's one of the main reasons, obviously, that i give this 5/5. The standout tracks from an Album of standout tracks (If that makes sense..) would be \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\", \\"lhabia\\", \\"Around The Fur\\", \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\", \\"Lotion\\", \\"Dai The Flu\\" and \\"Head Up (Feat. Max Cavalera)\\"..I think i left out 3 songs there. Which goes to show how great this Album really is, as \\"Mascara\\", \\"Rickets\\" and \\"MX\\" are still top-quality Deftones songs. <br /> <br />My two personal favourite songs are both \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" and \\"Head Up\\". \\"Head Up\\" features Max Cavalera of Soulfly/ex-Sepultura, and inevitably ends up sounding a lot like Soulfly (With the riff and then the long outro..) except for Chino Moreno's vocals. Max Cavalera actually doesn't seem to contribute much except for a few words here and there. All in all, those are the two most catchy songs i think. \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\" is also a very catchy song, that they also shot a Video for. \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" to me, is the Deftones most stunning song off this Album though. (They shot a Video for that as well..) <br /> <br />I think every metal fan in general has either heard, or heard about, the Deftones by now. And if you've thought about getting into them, but weren't sure and still not sure of which Album of theirs to start with, i'd start with this definitely. This is very highly recommended to fans of Alternative Metal, and to all fans of metal in general as well.  <br /> <br />Without question \\"Around the Fur\\" is 5/5
0345442970|3.0|My ongoing quest for knowledge of the force prompted me to purchase this novel.  The story explains some of the events that occurred in The Phantom Menace, but after completing the book I felt like I had been reading a homework assignment in a textbook.  In my opinion James Luceno does not adequately place the reader in the action.  Throughout the novel I felt like I was reading the story after the fact.  The writing did not grab and hold my attention, and I was unable to become part of the story.   <br /> <br />For the die-hard Star Wars fan, the information in this novel is vital to the events leading up to the Clone War.  There is a plot twist in the book that will surprise, but it seemed like it took forever to get to it.     <br /> <br />For the casual reader I do not recommend this book.  If you are not intrigued by the events of the Star Wars saga this book will only be marginally entertaining.  I do however recommend Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul) by Michael Reaves.  A very thrilling novel it is! <br />

I would recommend this novel to people that like math because Christopher uses math in figuring out certain mysteries.
B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax is one of my favorite bands. This is hands down their best album, and up to par with other thrash classics such as Reign In Blood, Rust In Peace, Ace Of Spades, and Master Of Puppets. There is some great vocalsdone by Joey Belladonna. Good news too: He rejoined the band! We also have great guitar solos from Dan Spitz (who also rejoined the band), some tight rhythm work from Scott Ian, great HEARABLE bass-lines by Frank Bello (who, IMHO, isn't as great as Danny Lilker, but is still good), and exellent drummingfrom Charlie Benante. The album kicks off with the title track, which has a cool intro, goes into the post-intro (for lack of a better word) and gets tp the main riff, which also has exellent drumming from Benante. The next song, Caught In A Mosh, is what many Anthrax fans, including myself, consider to be their best song. You gotta love that intro and the pre-chorus/chorus. The next song, I Am The Law, has a killer guitar intro, and is another heavy song. Another favorite is Indians. I love Benante's double-bass intro in the song. All the songs here kick ass, but the above mentioned songs are my favorites. A must for metalheads.<br /><br />Track ratings:<br /><br />1. Among the Living 5/5<br /><br />2.

0805076476|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, so I sort of knew what to expect.  Both are excellent, but the book isn't quite as choppy as the movie.  Readers aren't exactly told what's going on, but they certainly have more information to form their own opinions with.  The book (and movie, to a degree) is packed with one liners that are at the same time funny and profound.  They're all instantly quotable.  The story is constantly morphing into something new.  The strength of both the book and the movie is that neither is heavy-handed.  Their subtlety and humor are what make them great.  Both could easily suck, if they were didactic, but Palahniuk works his magic, taking readers to the edge without pushing them off.  Great social commentary and scolding.  It reads fast, so even if you don't like it, you won't be wasting your time.
B000002JNJ|5.0|When I first heard of Dimebag's death, I hit myself in the head thinking \\"Wake up! This isn't really happening! It's just a sick nightmare! Wake up, wake up!\\" You can only imagine how upset I was when I came to my senses and had to accept the fact that Dime is dead... In fact, I still cry to this day, and whenever I hear the song \\"Cemetary Gates\\", I cry! Dimebag was one of the men who inspired me to play guitar. I still can't believe something like this could ever happen. How can the security gaurds NOT detect that gun? What really makes me even more upset is that people seem to have forgotten that Dime is dead, yet after ten years Kurt Nobrain killed himself, he's sill loved and remembered, and at Gat Faggot (Hot Topic), there is a section of nothing but Kurt Cobain t-shirts. So sad that the best guitarists are dying, and people don't seem to care; but people still cry for Kurt Nobrain. Sad... As for chingy's #1 fan, I hope you feel mortified. Not only have you disrespected one of the bets guitarists ever, you said that Van Gaylen 3 (no offense to VH, but that album sucks) is good. Please, **** off.<br /><br />Now for the album:<br /><br />It is one of my favorite albums of all time. I mean REALLY high, like in the top 5. Songs like Cowboys From Hell, Primal Concrete Sledge, and Domination get my fancy. However the best song here is the seven-minute epic ballad: Cemetary Gates. I LOVE that song. It's hands down the best ballad ever known to man-kind! Whenever I hear that song nowadays, I cry. Dimebg, you were an amazing guitarist, may you shred in peace. :'(<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />1.

B00076ZZ9I|5.0|Musically, it's AC/DC - odds are, you already have an opinion. <br />Technically, the DVD-A side is indeed PCM stereo (not one of the lossy DVD-A options) and sounds better than the traditional CD audio.  I was also able to rip the CD side into iTunes, albiet slowly, probably due to the evil DRM stuff on the CD. <br />Not only did the DVD-A side sound better, but the DVD was actually mastered correctly!  You do NOT need a television to enjoy the improved audio quality.  Most DVD-A discs I've encountered require using the menu just to listen to music, and hitting track ahead doesn't alway take you to the next track as you'd expect.  This disc is perfect in that regard - insert disc, hit play!
0790729652|5.0|This is one of the best comic-movies ever made,and most certainly,the best Batman movie ever 'till now!!!<br /><br />With a genius director,this movie filed with an epic storyline,characters,and music.Joker is maybe the best villain ever appeared in a movie,and the action-scenes are cool ever for 16 years later.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Thank you, Mr D. \\"Artist/Designer/Kibitzer\\", for your review. <br />True DT fans would love TOT because they would have the same eclectic taste as DT itself has.  DT has gives itself a new trait to its music and it still sounds great.  That is the great thing about DT.  I have every CD, and not one is the same, and that is what I love about it.  However, TOT and Awake do come close.  I strongly recommend TOT to DT fans everywhere.  If they don't like it, then they can just bary their DT fan status along with all of their DT cd's.
0790730960|1.0|This was my question when I first saw this movie.Unbelievably boring plot(although a good direction by Tim Burton),stupid,stupid characters,and a Batman that is completely overshadowed by the villans. <br />Tim Burtons as a director does his best to save this potato,but unfortuently even he can't. <br />I loved ''BATMAN'' and ''BATMAN FOREVER'',but this horrible sequel makes ''BATMAN & ROBIN''(which sucks) seem like ''INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE''!
B000068G9X|5.0|There are many records that were made as an attempt to scare parents. There are many records that have tried to capture the imagery and sense of evil. The first Danzig record was released a very long time ago. I was very young upon it's release. I would listen to it in my room alone and get fruck out. It still freaks me out. It's a great album to spin as an adolescent and it's a great rock album. It has weird devilish hillbilly rock appeal. It has tough guy symbolism and Mother is still a great effew to those who would like to censor what the kids listen to. On later Danzig records he/they conjure up more of a sexy werewolf/demonlover/vampire vibe and that's cool, but they hit the nail on the head right through a map of hell. I can't wait to see what the kids keep trying to come up with in an empty effort to top this.
B0004FSD6Y|5.0|This is the perfect CD to describe what Sum 41 is all about... rock (hint, hint).  The best song on the album is 88, closely followed by Pieces and We're All to Blame.  88 is brilliant, flawless, perfectly made.  Pieces is one of the most incredible songs ever recorded.  And We're All To Blame, although overplayed, is a great song too.  This album is worth every penny.
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenima in my opinion edges out Undertow as the second best Tool album, and is slightly behind the masterpiece \\"Lateralus.\\"  Many people do not seem to understand Tool and what they are all about.....they do not, for the most part, construct a song that is built around a simple 2/4 with a drummer who simply bangs on a snare, then kick, then snare, etc...Tool's style has to be put into perspective...you cannot simply listen to the instruments, but must listen to what Keenan is talking about...there are powerful messages being stated here that clueless nu-metal fans will not understand.....My personal favorite tracks are \\"Stinkfist,\\" \\"Forty-Six and Two,\\" \\"Eulogy,\\" and my favorite track, \\"Aenima.\\"  The other tracks on here serve their purpose as well, and contribute to the entire experience that is Aenima.  This album should be listened to by all, especially metal fans who are sick of the new crap that is being played on the radio now.
B000099T2L|4.0|Ms. Bootylicious proves there's more to her than great packaging.  This is a good CD with great dance tunes.  Well worth the money.  My favorite cut is the unlisted song dedicated to her father. Overall, I think you won't be disappointed

This Aladdin DVD is a must-have!!!
B00005R2IS|5.0|Some of our film loves don't leave us and this is just as captivating as when I first saw it as a pup. That sparse, stunning cinematography and that beautiful, luminous outback light. I get homesick just watching it and I live on the same continent. Nah, you don't NEED to suck on the Hollywood nipple. This is a bloody great film.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I thought that \\"Green-Day: American Idiot\\" was a great CD. I loved it! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! They really showed what they were made of! ***** out of ***** stars for me! The only thing that I had a concern was about the Explicit Lyrics. You can get the edited version though. It was such a good CD!
B000002UAX|4.0|A: Double album<br /><br />It is almost impossible to keep up the quality level over the course of 80 minutes (something today's musicians are discovering thanks to consumer pressure to 'fill the CD capacity'..in essence making every CD the equivalent of 2 vinyl albums). The Beatles had the advantage going in that they essentially were all working as individuals with each person singing what they wrote (other than Ringo on \\"Good Night\\") and having the others act as backing singers/musicians, making for a bigger pool of material. Even so, this album flags often and George Martin is correct in saying it would have been improved by paring it to one disc.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />Best bits on here include a George song for the first time:\\"While my Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is a fantastic lyric with some tasty Eric Clapton soloing on it and an all-time rock classic. John's tender \\"Dear Prudence\\" stands out, along with 2 of the hardest rockers Paul ever did \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\". \\"Blackbird\\" has rightly been covered by countless others. \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" is the essence of singalong pop. \\"Revolution 1\\" is another classic, although better in the single rendition with the harder edged guitar.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />\\"Wild Honey Pie\\",\\"Revolution 9\\" and \\"Good Night\\" are the most immediate clunkers to point out. It also must be said that Paul's \\"Why Don't We Do it in the Road?\\", George's \\"Savoy Truffle\\", and John's \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide..\\" and \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" don't add much to the proceedings.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />While it's still one all Beatle fans will need to own because of the standout tracks which weren't singles, it's probably their weakest \\"late period\\" album ('Yellow Submarine' was more of a sop to Capitol than a proper album, so I'm not counting that one.)<br /><br />Were I to play George Martin now, I'd arrive at the lineup/playing order below:<br /><br />Birthday (Paul) 2:42<br />Piggies (George) 2:04<br />Dear Prudence (John) 3:56<br />Revolution (John)(single version) 3:30<br />Blackbird (Paul) 2:18<br />Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-da (Paul) 3:08<br />While my Guitar Gently Weeps (George) 4:45<br />Julia (John) 2:54<br />Don't Pass Me By (Ringo) 3:42<br />Helter Skelter (Paul) 4:29<br />I'm So Tired (John) 2:03<br />Martha My Dear (Paul) 2:28<br />Yer Blues (John) 4:01<br />I Will (Paul) 1:46<br />Cry Baby Cry (John) 3:10<br /><br />This gives you a nearly even distribution of John/Paul songs, George's best 2, and Ringo's best 1.8  Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-da (Paul) 3:08  While my Guitar Gently Weeps (George) 4:45  Julia (John) 2:54  Don't Pass Me By (Ringo) 3:42  Helter Skelter (Paul) 4:29  I'm So Tired (John) 2:03  Martha My Dear (Paul) 2:28  Yer Blues (John) 4:01  I Will (Paul) 1:46  Cry Baby Cry (John) 3:10    This gives you a nearly even distribution of John/Paul songs, George's best 2, and Ringo's best 1.

B000002UDB|5.0|If you want to be a purist about it, these songs were never really meant to be together. The first 6 tunes were featured in the bizarre film of the same name, the last 5 were 1967 singles for the Fabs. Despite the fact these weren't conceived as an album, it works together pretty well. In fact the two most jarring pieces on here come from the film (\\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"Flying\\").<br /><br />Highlights include \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", John's acid-drenched ode to a childhood play place, Paul's own schoolboy reminisce in \\"Penny Lane\\" with its stratospheric piccol trumpet line, wordplay tour de force \\"I am the Walrus\\" (Jeff Lynne says his career with E.L.O. was an attempt to further explore the orchestra-rock hybrid sound here in more detail..), Paul's attack on the band's onetime guru, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, (\\"Fool on the Hill\\"), and brotherhood anthem \\"All You Need is Love\\".<br /><br />While not in the league of the others, Paul's faux music hall number (\\"Your Mother Should Know\\") is also a great effort and the title track's a standout as well.<br /><br />Low points come on the odd instrumental \\"Flying\\" which isn't horrid but it's subpar for the band, John's \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\" would have to be considered one of his lesser lyrics, and \\"Blue Jay Way\\" is experimental in a bad way. The vocals sound offkey, the backwards pieces seem to be thrown in rather than a mere part of the arrangement...it doesn't work as well as John's similar explorations.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Because you can't get \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" on any compilations, you need to get this. But I'd wait on this one until you have \\"Sgt Pepper\\",\\"Revolver\\",\\"Rubber Soul\\",\\"Abbey Road\\", and \\"Let it Be\\".

Now, if you are still in question as to whether you have the ability to read such a book, no worries! Just pick this book up and READ it!! You won't be sorry!!
B000002UAU|5.0|The fact that the relative worth of this album is still being debated nearly 40 years after its release reveals its timelessness. While this is NOT my favourite Beatles album (Revolver holds that title), it's impossible to convincingly argue that any single album of theirs changed the landscape of rock music like this one.<br /><br />1) It shifted sales emphasis from 45RPM singles to full length albums. There were NO singles released from the album in 1967,U.S. or U.K. The Beatles also released it without 'bands' on the vinyl so you had to listen to the full side all together-as a suite, rather than playing it as separate tracks.<br /><br />2) It caused critical appreciation of rock music as a medium of art to increase. For the first time, rock musicians were treated as people with something to SAY to culture.<br /><br />3) It was the most ambitious undertaking to be released that year (I'd argue the lost album \\"SMiLe\\" from the Beach Boys would have had it beat had Brian Wilson had the support needed to complete that work THEN...rather than some 30 odd years later) in terms of stretching the technical capabilities of the recording studio. New methods of miking instruments...tape manipulation...extensive use of overdubbing...all these were used to make \\"Pepper\\" unlike any Beatles album that had come before.<br /><br />The fallout from this album is mixed:<br /><br />On one hand, it provided the inspiration to countless art-minded musicians who would follow after. Without this album, I can't imagine that there would be a U2, R.E.M, Queen, Pink Floyd, Todd Rundgren, Yes, Moody Blues (at least in their 'Nights in White Satin' sound), Prince, or XTC, just to name a few. So for this, I'm grateful for its influence.<br /><br />The flip side of that coin is we're now burdened with self-important releases from \\"artists\\" that would be better off admitting they didn't have much to say beyond boy gets girl/boy loses girl pop ditties. Any number of 60s bands released horrible \\"psych\\" albums in response to it (\\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" anyone?) and now the very idea of the 3 minute pop song is viewed as \\"low\\" art. Because of this, a band like Squeeze doesn't get the proper regard they should. It should be pointed out that songs aren't automatically better because they don't get \\"Top 40\\" airplay.<br /><br />As to the music itself, it's well-deserved of its reputation as a classic album in not only the Beatles canon but in all of rock. There are only 2 songs on it that I frequently skip (\\"Lovely Rita\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\") and \\"With a Little Help from my Friends\\",\\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\",\\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" and the transcendent \\"A Day in the Life\\" are among the finest tunes ever made in rock. Moments like the rooster's crow that blends into the guitar note in the \\"Sgt. Pepper (Reprise)\\" just seal the deal.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Forget whether this is the \\"best\\" album of all time. Forget if it's the first \\"concept\\" album (it's definitely not..Sinatra did those before them..it may not even be the first ROCK concept album. One could argue the \\"Beach Boys Party!\\" was that.) Forget if it's even the Beatles' best. Just give it a listen. And then listen some more. And more. And more.

B00005QIPH|4.0|Don't listen more than once or you'll catch it.  At first I thought, \\"OK, same sound, over and over, short, snappy, jaded\\" and had a hard time distinguishing say, Someday from When It Started.  But Is This It? insinuates itself into the ear, each song gradually claiming its own identity, and hangs on tenaciously.  Definitely New York and definitely from the bloodlines of the Velvet Underground, Stooges, Ramones and others, and now siring their own next generation, e.g. Stellastarr, the Strokes aren't out to remake the world, they're just out to play fun, snotty, pouty rock and roll.  And they do it very, very well.  Expect more and you'll be disappointed, but take them for what they are and this is a keeper. Best cuts -- the title song, early Lou Reed vocal imitations on The Modern Age, Barely Legal and Take It or Leave It.

B0002KVUKM|3.0|If you're looking for a film in the classic school of vampire horror, pass this one by - you won't like it. <br /> <br />If you're looking for lots of mindless action, great CGI, and witty banter - this is one flick you're going to like. <br /> <br />The characters are two-dimensional, the dialogue is witty and quick.  The monsters are basic and hackneyed - but fun, with great special effects and excellent casting.  The story is absurd, with nods to (or theft from, depending on your point of view) many of the classics - we've got Mr. Hyde as depicted by somone who read Hulk comics rather than the story, Van Helsing as an action hero with nifty gadgets rather than the traditional old and wise man who outthinks Dracula, and plenty of monsters from the classics of the 40s and 50s, remade to fit as many of them in as possible with great effects and little relevance to the story. <br /> <br />Mindless action fun - but sometimes, mindless action fun is just that - fun.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album explodes with an intensity which is to be heard to be believed. This is the finest debut any band can expect to have and I think Pearl Jam's later offerings could not reach the level of 'Ten'. It is really frustrating that this awesome band has always lurked behind Nirvana. Nirvana are good but nowhere near Pearl Jam both in musical arrangements and lyrics. Pearl Jam were the most happening band in the nineties and this album is testimony. 'Evenflow', Jeremy' and 'Black' are the most precious gems in this treasure trove.

It is as beautiful and exquisite as rock gets.   <br />\\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is the one of the most achingly real expressions of bad love as you will find in any genre from opera to blues and on... The rest of the songs on this album are excellent as well.

B000002J0B|5.0|If you don't like Led Zeppelin, you're just plain wrong.  You've listened to the wrong people -- perhaps hung out with the wrong crowd.  Maybe you knew a bunch of jerks in high school who did nothing but drink, beat up smaller kids, and listen to Zeppelin all day.  Get past that -- you're older and more mature now.<br /><br />Look in the mirror.  Ask yourself why you don't have a soul, and what may have happened to cause that.  Decide what kind of person you are and what kind of person you hope to become.  Re-evaluate the things that move you.  Then put on \\"Houses Of The Holy\\".  AND GET ON YOUR KNEES.<br /><br />No one can sit there, after listening to Houses Of The Holy, and say that Led Zeppelin is bad or even overrated.  In fact, Led Zeppelin can't be rated high enough.<br /><br />As with all things I love and cherish, I take Zeppelin albums for granted.  I may even put them away for a few months or sometimes years at a time.  That is, of course, until I hear ridiculous talk that Led Zeppelin should be lumped in with the Eagles and Pink Floyd in discussions of overrated bands.  Then I am moved to act -- and write.  And as I do so, I rediscover my love of Zeppelin.  I come back to great albums like \\"Houses Of The Holy\\", and my love is not only rediscovered, it's affirmed.  And I hear once again what Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham once were, as if it were the first time.<br /><br />Houses of the Holy isn't Led Zeppelin's best CD, but it's Top Three, and if I were introducing an alien to the greatness of Led Zeppelin, I would bring them to this CD first.  The album covers all strengths of Zeppelin appropriately.  Those strengths are too numerous to mention here, but you will hear the crunching, heavy guitars, the gentle hippie-type songs, gothic tunes of doom, the rock anthems, the soaring vocals, and the superior drumming of one of the all-time greats -- John Bonham.<br /><br />Plus, it ends with the greatest of all Zeppelin songs -- The Ocean.  On that song, all members of Zeppelin are playing in absolute peak form.  It's better than Kashmir, or Whole Lotta Love, or Dazed or Confused, or Heartbreaker, or The Rover (barely), or When The Levee Breaks.<br /><br />If you don't own this, you're missing out.  If you hate Zeppelin because of high school dances and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", forget about those memories.  It's time to put away your preconceived, misguided dislikes and come back to the music.t song, all members of Zeppelin are playing in absolute peak form.

B00003CXRM|2.0|I was amazed the good reviews this movie received, because I found it embarrassingly cheesey and contrived. Maybe that was supposed to be part of the charm, who knows...The movie felt like in a lot of scenes, they were trying to be quirky and offbeat just for the sake of being quirky and offbeat, and it just ended up not being very entertaining for me. George Clooney felt like he was acting...only the always excellent John Turturro was believable for me. The music was effective and really crucial to setting the mood of each scene.  ..in fact, that may have been the most entertaining part of the whole movie. I think I chuckled maybe once or twice thruout the whole movie and really lost interest in it part way through. Can't recommend it, but judge for yourselves.

B0000062Y2|3.0|The movie soundtrack of JCS is a mixed bag for the JCS fan. On one hand, it has essential gems not found on the original cast recording or many others. \\"Could We Start Again Please\\" and \\"Then We are Decided\\" were written for the film and are welcome additions to the story. Extended or alternate lyrics in Hosanna and the Temple are bonuses for the collector.  Yet this is a far cry in quality from the original, both in sound quality and voice talents (esp. Herod). Some of the problem no doubt is that the context of these songs in the film are lost in translation to cd. But it's also just not as good, and some aspects sound dated (ie. sound \\"70s\\") moreso than other renditions.  In sum, to non-fans, don't make this your one copy of JCS to own--get the original. To fans, this supplements the original with new material and alternate interpretations that I think are worthwhile.
B0002W4SWC|4.0|In this fast paced, modern age it seems, that society and especially the media have all these requirements and expectations of young single women. They should have a high profile professional job, supermodel looks, be suave, witty and sophisticated...oh and also be able to land that perfect husband and have the perfect 2.5 children by the time the old biological clock goes off. These ideals are all satirized and laid to waste in the hilarious British, romatic film comedy, \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\". In this film we meet Bridget Jones, who hardly meets society's  standards and ideals. She's somewhat overweight (at least by Hollywood standards) and drinks and smokes way to much! Bridget is terrible at her different jobs in the media profession and has got to be the world's worst public speaker, who often blurts out the most embarassing comments at the wrong time. Too make matters worst, she seems to have no luck in the romance department. Bridget Jones is the kind of gal constantly making memos on how she's going to take the world on and make her life right in the process. Unfortunatly for every giant leap she attempts, there is usually a bannana peel waiting to embarassingly be stepped on. The film's plotline is liberally (and proudly) swiped from Jane Austen's classic novel, \\"Pride & Prejudice\\". Two men keep coming and going into her love life. First is her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) a witty, handsome, but vile Cad, who over and over again wriggles his way into Bridget's bed, only to find a way to break her heart, whenever things get serious. Bridget's other would-be suiter is family friend, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). He's a bit wooden in personality and even a stuffshirt and somewhat rude. But he's also kind, honest and dependable. Well I bet you can figure out, which guy constantly has Bridget's affections for most of the film! (BIG Hint: Nice guys seem to always finish last!) In the end Bridget goes for the guy, who just loves her for being herself, not for what she's trying to pretend to be. The script by Helen Fielding (based on her book & newspaper columns) and Richard Curtis (the dean of British romantic film comedies) is both witty and enjoyable. All three of the film's lead actors seem to have loads of chemistry together. Texas born, Renee Zellweger pulls off the British accent and totally becomes this modern day every-women, who finds inventive ways to become embarassed at any moment. Hugh Grant, who seems to have made a career out of playing eye lash fluttering, nice guy roles, gleefully takes on the devilish cad of the film with great success. Finally, Colin Firth seems like the only actor, who could play the Mark Darcy role. The movie's writers freely admit that they wrote the part for him based ironically on his own performance in the movie \\"Pride & Prejudice\\". The DVD of the film is fine. The picture & sound are sevicable but nothing special. In this collector's addition you recieve a nice behind-the-scenes featurette, that is quite interesting. Also included are deleted scenes, which to be perfectly honest, are as funny as anything from the final film. (This includes a hilarious montage of Hugh Grant's slimey, Daniel being interviewed, while sitting in a bar with a wide variey of seamy looking dates) It's obvious in this DVD edition that some of the extras are being used to hype the film's sequal, \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\". Many of the extras are fine, but not necessary. This is a wonderful romantic comedy, that is most entertaining. Highly recommmended!at she's trying to pretend to be.

B00005A46T|5.0|With this fabulous release I can honestly say that slipknot, to me, is considered to be the heaviest band in the world no need for weak material from other less influential bands such as Extreme Noize Terror, Kreator, Gorgoroth, At the Gates, Dismember, Sodom, Nuclear Assault, or Deep Wound. Slipknot has it all from the best drumming to the most brutal vocals imaginable, giving Chris Barnes and Lord Worm a run for their money. Anyways this release is very intricate no pretty parts just straight forth to the subject matter and the grinding riffs <br />why need anything else? nu-metal has everything from rap drum beats (which by the way surpass jazz drumming by a long shot)and is pure genius by very talented artist. This band proves, with every release so far, that nine is better than three ::cough:: Nargaroth, Bathory, Destruction, Celtic Frost::cough:: We need more bands like this among others such as Korn and God Smack
0385510454|5.0|Fast-paced, intriguing thriller that is hard to put down!!  At the center of the tale is of course a wayward lawyer; in this case, it's Joel Backman--a Washington lobbyist whose greed for power, money and women is legendary.  Backman gets his hands on a computer software written by a few brilliant young men that is able to control spy satellites that are orbiting the earth--satellites whose existence to this point had been completely unknown.  When Backman decides to represent his clients in their scheme to sell the software to the highest bidder, the scheme falls apart; and his clients end up dead, and The Broker ends up in the federal pen.  With a couple decades of a prison sentence to serve, Joel Backman doesn't ever expect to taste or smell freedom again. Suddenly, however, from out of nowhere a presidential pardon is issued, and Backman finds himself a \\"free\\" man.  Amidst much secrecy, Backman is given a new identity, and a new country.  Deposited in the city of Bologna, Italy, he is instructed to learn Italian and to leave no trails.  But Backman is no dummy, and it doesn't take him long to realize that there is no one that he can trust, he is being constantly followed, and all of his movements and activities are tightly controlled.  Eventually, The Broker realizes that his pardon was done with an agenda in mind...with many agencies in many countries desiring to see him dead, the US has decided just to sit back and watch the fun...... <br /> <br />In a style reminiscent of his blockbuster success with The Firm, Grisham tells an awesome story that never stops, gathering momentum until the riproaring end. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|Proving themselves that they are a force to be reckoned with in the genre of Death Metal music comes  Krakow Poland's own \\"Behemoth\\".  The release of \\"Demigod\\" on Olympic Recordings (a subsidiary of Century Media Records) is a pummeling assault to all of the senses in the most brutal of fashions.  The difference between Behemoth and other purveyors of the genre is apparent right off the bat.  The band lays down the power as soon as the CD begins for the band holds a stark difference to many others in the technical precision.  What I heard on the CD has yet to be matched and clearly they are out to raise the bar on the Death style as much as Dimmu Borgir has raised the expectations of those who follow the Black Metal stuff.  Most impressive to me was the intense drumming by Inferno.  He holds the record in my book on faster double-bass drums recorded if you ask me.  I think he even is faster than the mighty Dave Lombardo of Slayer.  Nergal growls with the best of them about the Dark Gods they follow and it is definitely a bleak world they sing of.  One expects that in Death Metal after all.  The lineup on the CD is rounded out by Orion on bass, and Seth on guitar.<br /><br />To time it, the record will speed by you faster than you might expect, running a mere ten songs with the longest number being the last (which runs over 8 minutes while others are topped at 3.30).  I had some immediate favorites in the thunder and these were perhaps \\"Demigod\\", \\"Conquer All\\" and \\"The Reign\\" (I am a sucker for epics be they Death or anything else).<br /><br />The CD is a close amount to what you will see live in concert, and I advise fans of the music to check the band out live if they make a visit.  They really do the stuff as fast in concert if not faster.  You will quickly be taken by their presence and foreboding power.  Enjoy, if you dare.
0385508417|5.0|I haven't seen the movie based on this book entitled \\"Christmas with the Kranks\\" yet, but I hope it captures the simple, fun-filled magic John Grisham has created here. To me, the book harkens back to the kind of old-fashioned story telling from movies of the fifties, where there were no gimmicks, wild stunts, or any of the modern \\"tricks\\" today's movies and books often resort to in order to hold an audience's attention.<br /><br />The plot is straightforward. When the Kranks lone daughter goes away to the Peace Corp, with no plans to return for Christmas, Mr. Krank talks his wife into skipping the hectic, stressful holiday season altogether by going on a cruise. Despite harassment and interference from their entire neighborhood, who sees skipping Christmas as a betrayal to not only them, but to pretty much everything that's sane and decent in the world, Mr. Krank remains defiant, he and his wife finding themselves in all sorts of uncomfortable and downright hysterical moments. But as always happens, things change when their precious daughter calls at the last minute, reporting that's on her way home to introduce her parents to her new fianc&eacute;. This is when we all see to excruciating and hilarious effect just how horrible last minute shopping is during the Yuletide season.<br /><br />I loved this book, even though it waxes a bit sentimental at the end. It's the perfect Christmas book for those who truly appreciate the beauty of this particular time of year, as well as to all those who have found themselves a heartbeat away from going postal while caught in another long, boisterous, tired, angry line at the local department store.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks, author of \\"Phoenix Tales: Stories of Death & Life\\"
B00005JNTV|5.0|I doubt there's any movie you will see this year that will be as good as Sin City. it's visually stunning, sexy, full of great lines, unforgettable characters and suspenseful action. The cast is great too. Micky Rourke shows why he should be in more movies as Marv. Marv is a kickass character  who's out for revenge against the people who killed his love Goldie. Micky Rourke is just simply awesome as him and should be even nominated for best supporting actor.<br /><br />  The rest of cast are really good too but not as good. Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer) who I didn't even know existed until last year is also extremely cool as Dwight. He goes after  the dangerous Benicio Del Toro and winds up starting a war between hookers and cops. So he has to set to make things right. The heroes played by Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis all have  soft spots for women. Willis \\"who's also the best he's been in awhile\\" has to protect the sexy Jessica Alba from the Yellow Bastard.<br /><br />  The Yellow Bastard is a sleazy pedifile who tried to kill  her when she was little but was stopped by Willis. The cops are crooked though and put Willis in prison because he wouldn't take blame for raping the girl. The Yellow Bastard's father is the mayor and owns the cops so he can get them to do anything he wants. When Willis gets out of prison he finds that he put Alba's life in danger by finding her and leading the Yellow Bastard straight to her. So he has to protect her one more time.<br /><br />  This movie is just great and director Robert Rodriguez's crowning achievement. Since he gets some directing help from Quintin Tarantino and Frank Miller I don't know if he'll get the best director nomination he deserves. Anyway he does here what every director who adapts a book should do, get some insight from the writer to make sure it's done right. This movie isn't just right though...it's done perfect. After seeing this I think  Rodriguez is the only person that could bring Stephen King's Dark Tower books to life as well.Dark Tower books to life as well.
B000002NG7|5.0|This album is by far my favorite by Faith No More. I like every song a lot, with the exception of \\"Naked In Front Of The Computer\\" and \\"Pristina\\", which I just think are decent. The ones that stand out are \\"Stripsearch\\", \\"Helpless\\", and \\"Ashes To Ashes\\". My favorite on Album Of The Year is \\"Mouth To Mouth\\", it's just so strange and great. I don't know why so many people consider this to be FNM's weakest album, because I think it's brilliant. GO BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Unfortunately, their kick ass bassist Nick Oliveri left the band before they recorded this. Unfortunately, this cd doesn't kick as much ass as Songs For The Deaf. But fortunately... it still does kick ass. The tone of this album is more mellow and a little darker than previous releases, with a similar style to Rated R. If you are new to this band then I would suggest Songs For The Deaf or their self-titled cd first... and Lullabies To Paralyze too i guess. In my opinion this is one of the last great rock bands around, so if you are into real rock music then definitely check this out. Don't listen to my opinion though, hear how it rocks all by yourself. Actually, do take my opinion, take it and mix it up with some good pills and chill out with your new Queens Of The Stone Age disc, it's how they'd want it.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|Choosing which Costello album is his best is really hard to do. Every one of his albums is rated five stars by at least one person, so how the blazes are you supposed to decide which one is the best he's done? <br /> <br />Well, for me this is Costello's best. Not that he goes downhill from here (his best song \\"Oliver's Army\\" is on his next album) but the actual album has 13 great songs on it. The first four songs are perhaps the best on the album, and I have loved \\"Pump it Up\\" since I was about three years old!(I don't wanna go to) Chelsea and \\"Radio Radio\\" are the other hit songs on here, and wherever you are you can't help but sing along! <br /> <br />If for nothing else, buy it so you can decipher the lyrics to \\"Pump it up\\"! It's brilliant!
B000021YQV|5.0|Man I dont know why everyone has to write a really long review on every song on here cause it isnt nessecarry. to make it short and sweet every song is a 10/10 on this album this is by far the best album in a long time and i hope mezmorize is right up therew with it......./.......

B00005NVDF|5.0|Play It Again Sam somehow got a reputation of not being as good as Annie Hall.  Nearly everyone has bought into that assessment, and that's a shame.  While Annie Hall is a great comedy, Play It Again Sam is a true artistic masterpiece.  In many ways--the characters, the shtick--of Annie Hall derive from the earlier Play It Again Sam. <br /> <br />What makes PIAS an artistic masterpiece?  The completely innovative way in which the Bogart character and the Casablanca associations are woven in.  Comedy not for the sake of laughing, but in support of the deeper theme.  Everything ties together, each part supports the whole, and the whole is so much more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br />Hopefully, the movie will someday get the credit it deserves.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|If you woke up one morning and thought to yourself, \\"What would motivate me to listen to all those Priest records that have been sitting for months and months, collecting dust while I indulged in heavy doom and stoner rock bands?\\"  The answer, dear friends, would be this album.  \\"Angel\\" came as a surprise to me, namely because I'm used to \\"reunion\\" albums being hopelessly stiff retreads of the past.  I don't get excited about Maiden anymore, because only their earlier records still seem fresh and exciting: prog metal of the new wave, if you will.  In any event, \\"Angel\\" isn't as good as \\"British Steel\\" or \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" or even \\"Point of Entry.\\"  It's not as progressive as \\"Sin After Sin\\" or \\"Stained Class,\\" and it's certainly not as silly as \\"Turbo\\" (what is?...other than the video for \\"Locked In\\"?).   <br /> <br />\\"Angel\\" illustrates how well Priest have mastered the approach to all their eras of song-writing.  The title track, \\"Judas Rising,\\" recalls \\"Stained Class\\" or even \\"Sad Wings of Destiny.\\"  \\"Deal with the Devil\\" recalls \\"Breaking the Law\\" or \\"Riding on the Wind\\" or even \\"Devil's Child.\\"  \\"Worth Fighting For\\" recalls \\"United\\" or, perhaps, \\"Evening Star.\\"  And \\"Lochness,\\" for all its potential silliness, somehow pulls it off (despite what Classic Rock Magazine may say); loping and heavy, with acoustic passages matched by riffs that could have been written by Sabbath, \\"Lochness\\" recalls \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" or \\"Sinner.\\"  All this, and \\"Hellrider\\" and \\"Painkiller\\" are like twins: two speedy, power metal assaults.  Isn't that kind of what we were all looking for?  For Priest to give us their brand of metal? <br /> <br />When I say \\"recall,\\" that's exactly what I mean.  This album is like walking through the best parts of the Priest back catalogue.  In that way, I suppose it's not a wholly original album; but if Priest re-use the types of compositions that they, for all purposes, helped to invent, that's still more original than mere imitation, right?  I don't think that one song on this album -- other than \\"Judas Rising\\" -- matches the song(s) that it \\"recalls.\\"  But if you buy it, you'll want to listen to it; it won't be a \\"reunion\\" album that you buy because you feel obligated to do so.  It's energetic, it's heavy, it's fun, it's catchy, it's melodic, it's tight, and it's fast.  What else would you want in a Priest record?
B0007X6ST2|5.0|\\"Bring on the Night\\" is an exceptional recording by an artist who was searching for new ways to expand his creative musical boundaries.  Putting together this band was a gutsy move on Sting's part, especially when you consider how popular The Police were when they broke up.  Sting assembled some of the best Jazz musicians to expand and focus the intensity of his sound.  What he achieved here is magical.  Now, we finally get to enjoy this music as it was meant to be - Live and in living color!<br /><br />\\"Bring on the Night\\" captures all the elements of Sting's brilliant past and focuses them through an expanded Jazz lense that opens up the melodies to provide space for some great spontaneous interactions.  This music snaps, crackles and burns.  The Jazz musicians, especially Branford Marsalis & Kenny Kirkland get to stretch out and really explore the rich songs  that Sting creates.  Listen to how well they lock in and groove on  the title track, and again on \\"One World / Love is the Seventh Wave\\".  The beautiful and haunting \\"Moon Over Burbon Street\\" could not have been captured any better.  My favorite track is \\"Children's Crusade\\" - where Branford's Sax solo just hangs in the air.  This band has great chemistry & it shows in the way they interact with each other on stage.  Hearing this music is a great experience but seeing it performed is what makes this an exceptional experience.  There is not a weak moment captured here.<br /><br />In a day and age where computer generated music is becoming the norm, it is special to witness an artist put together a classic live performance like this.  Sting broke new ground with this music.  It has been a joy to watch his music evolve from this recording in 1986, through today.  He is a complete musician with exceptional talents.  This DVD/CD captures a true master at work with some of the best talent in the business - and it smokes.  I will enjoy \\"Bring on the Night\\" for many years to come - I hope you will also.  Peace!!!!!e!!!!!
0446677450|1.0|This book is a real eye opener for. How a book so poorly written, lack of substance and specific could be on the best seller list?! I bought the book after reading some pages on chapter one that seem to be a good introduction to more good advices to come. The problem is that the whole book IS the introduction! Mr. Kiyosaki is the true master of the art of talking-for-hours-without-telling-you-anything. I should have listened to those 1-star reviewers.  <br /> <br />For those of you who found this book useful please seek professional advice before spending more money on more books, seminor or games from this guy. It's a SCAM.
B0007P3582|1.0|Let me start off by saying, I hated the first album too. So if you like \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\", maybe you shouldn't read this review. But what you should know is, I took the hood poll, and the people who were feeling the first album, said this album is hot trash! Piggy Bank is the weakest battle rap I've ever heard from somebody who is supposed to be a Big Dog in the game. So what Jada is mostly New York, so what True Story didn't sell 11 million, so what Nas got his \\"WIFE\\", (Not some skeezer who dissed him) tattoo'd on his arm, is that the best he could come up with?!?!  THIS TRACK WAS WEAK!!! Takeover, Hova got personal, Ether Nas got personal!!! When I heard those songs, I was like \\"Damn somebody gonna mess around and get shot\\". When I heard Piggy Bank, I said \\"This was so weak, I would be suprised if ANY of these guys answer\\". He said nothing!!! To be honest, all the drama I heard about \\"Piggy bank\\" was the only reason I bought the album. I heard he got at cats hard... WRONG!!!! I should have bootlegged this disaster. If I had a dollar for everytime 50 said \\"Shake it girl\\" on this album, I'd be making more money than him. He has two songs in a row where he says \\"Shake it\\" in the hook!!!! (Disco Inferno and whatever garbage song is right after it, check if you don't believe me!!!). Production on this album is WEAK!!! I honestly skipped almost every song. The only tracks I listened to from start to finish are Piggy Bank (Only because I like the beat) and \\"I'm supposed to Die Tonight\\" (Which is straight fire, I'm not a hater, I can respect good music). Other than that, Jada called it, this album is just somthing to break up Buds on. How am I buying an album and I can't even listen to the whole thing?!?! I just can't take these corny lyrics! I did not listen to the entire album people, that should tell you about the quality of this \\"album\\" (And I use that term loosely)! After like track 15 or so, I had to wrap it short (And I only made it to 15 because I cut a lotof songs in the middle of the first verse!!!! Had I tried to listen to every song, I don't think I would have made it to track 8!!!!!). As much as I hated the first joint, there were at least about six or seven tracks I was feeling. This album, there is one. I just don't see what the hype about this dude is coming from? Maybe he is in the same boat as LL and 99% of his fans wear high heels? Judging by the reviews I saw on Amazon, I see I'm not the only one who is using this album as a coaster.....
0670033375|4.0|As failure often teaches those who fail more than they learned by succeeding at the same task, Diamond begins his book with cautionary tales of societies - as opposed to civilizations, as several have complained in apparent ignorance of the title's content - which have experienced severe decline.  Diamond outlines five main causes for societal collapse, including hostile neighbors and trade relations, but emphasizes environmental damage because [a] he's a professor of geography and [b] it was his original thesis, which he expanded after further consideration. <br /> <br />Diamond offers several case societies whose local consumption of resources led them to severe decline because the demand placed on those resources did not allow for sufficient regrowth to sustain the populations who depended on them.  While some have complained that these societies are not civilizations and lack the complexity and breadth for good analogy to us presently, Diamond states that the interconnection between countries is so strong in the present that in most regards we may consider ourselves one self-contained and isolated unit - the earth in total.  When a student asked him what the Easter Islander who felled the last tree must have thought as he did so, Diamond uses this as an example of clinging to values and solutions that may once have been wise and expedient in light of a population's need, but are futile and self-destroying in the end.  No one can honestly say what that act must have been like, but it did happen; Diamond asks us to see our forests for the people which they support, and to recognize what our equivalents are in the global economy for the woodlands of Easter Island. <br /> <br />It isn't all doom and foreboding, as Diamond does mention successful cases of managing ecology to ensure enough in perpetuity for populations depending on it.  The Tokugawa shoguns of Japan, as an interesting example, developed an entire code of law, magistrates and professional silviculturalists to support reafforestation.  They supported the needs of an economy entirely dependent on wood for fuel and almost entirely dependent on wood for all types of construction for a hundred and fifty years, by degrees reversing the trend with plantation forestry until Japan's timber production returned to its pre-shogunate levels in the 1800's.  In contrast to the centralized directives of Tokugawa Japan, the citizens of Montana have developed a series of land use agreements that ensure a balance between development and the uncluttered vistas that made their land valuable to out-of-state home buyers in the first place.  While populations and goverments can be greedy and kill their golden geese through overuse and overextraction, they can also be prudent and recognize that their daily golden egg of sufficiency lies in how they manage the sources of that sufficiency. <br /> <br />At the back is a reading list from which Diamond did his research, and I plan to do the same.  That you're reading a review of a nonfiction book about enviromental dependency is a good start.  Self-education takes you even farther, and that is what Diamond intends for his readership - to develop the resources available in the minds of people who will have an impact on this earth in the coming decades.
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin III is by far my favorite cd in my led zep collection.  It offers classic titles, such as tangerine and since i've been loving you, personally my favorite led zep song.  The tracks on this cd are all very good and presents a new sound from their previous releases, 1 and 2.  The album features more of the acoustic sound than in any other of their cd's.  If you just feel like chilling to classic Led, then this cd is for you and a must have for any Zeppelin fan.
B000062XKL|5.0|please do not get misled by the 3 stars given to this movie by some reviewers. I think this movie is a winner all the way. <br />It brings together the finest actors from 3 generations: Marlon Brando, Robert Di Niro and Edward Norton. <br /> This movie systematically analyzes the planning and implementation of a heist. The clash of interests of the participants is a highlight. <br />Amazing actors, great plot and good music makes this movie a winner all the way. <br />Go for it guys!!! Its the kind of stuff that sensible people will enjoy <br />
B0000931QA|1.0|This album doesn't make any sense at all!! The songwriting is crap and this Tate guy just can't sing. All this is is another co-called \\"classic\\" that is nothing more than throw-away junk. When was the last time you saw any of these songs played on the TV or radio?? For a real concept album get Usher's Confessions or The Streets - A Grand Don't Come For Free. Now those are GOOD concept albums that are more ground braking than this unknown tripe.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I do not own this album, but heard a few tracks. At first I did not like them. I concluded Slipknot was a band of 9 untalented members in which the singer screamed, and the entire sound was that of a 4 member band. That was not how this album (or Slipknot in general) was actually. I heard many other tracks and was stunned by the quality that was hidden from tracks like eyeless and spit it out. I paid more attention to the lyrics and they sounded more better to me than they did before.
B0000029DD|4.0|Sometimes music rolls across our speakers or earphones that we are convinced has something very important or deeply emotional to say, and we try to listen really hard. The harder we listen, the more we are convinced that there is something serious going on there, but can't quite decide what exactly it is, and so we either listen a bit more or quickly lose interest. <br /> <br />That's what this CD is like. Every single one of the tracks is a testament to arrangement that is virtually unparalleled in rock singer/guitarists of the 90's, except for perhaps Buckley's friend and contemporary, Chris Cornell. The chord choices are inventive, the melodies tying those rather unorthodox chord structures together wonderfully. Something so seemingly simple-sounding is often but a dream in many rock songs of today. <br /> <br />What some reviewers have unfairly pegged as over-sentimentality or \\"whiny\\" singing is really just impatience and immaturity manifested in someone with a computer and a \\"license to review\\". Anyone who sings--either for fun or professionally--will listen to Buckley's voice and understand that this man's voice knows no boundaries. Whether we're talking about the boundaries between his chest, head or falsetto voices, the depth of feeling he puts into every word he sings, or the range of styles he is able to encompass on this disc, Buckley's voice is a force to be reckoned with for even the slightly attentive listener. <br /> <br />The songwriting here is also impeccable--shame on those who look no further than his beautiful rendition of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah.\\" Listen to the creative and curiously catchy title track, the gorgeous and heart-wrenching \\"Last Goodbye,\\" the chilling \\"Lilac Wine,\\" and the rock-out \\"Eternal Life.\\" Not only can this man sing and play, but he can write. <br /> <br />All of this being said, the most noticeable aspect of this disc is an feature we see frequently in the most inventive discs that tend to be released into the mainstream these days--a marked lack of immediate accessibility. As many have observed in the past, genius is probably the ability to say something profound with simple language that everyone can understand, and on this CD, the listener can tell right off the bat that something profound is being said, but the language way too complex for a once-through understanding. Not that this is a bad thing, just that it takes an unnecessary amount of patience to get to like the CD. Impatient listeners beware. Patient listeners, obtain this disc as soon as you can.
B000002HMH|4.0|I am a Metallica fan through and through and I just cannot understand why many of their fans trash this album.  No one can say this isn't real Metallica unless you are James, Lars, Kirk or (in this case) Jason.  They are the ones who decide what kind of music Metallica makes.  This is a great album.  Bleeding Me and The Outlaw Torn are especially fantastic tracks.  They may not scream METAL but they are still provocative and inspiring.  Quit comparing it to other Metallica albums and just listen to it!  I only give it 4 stars because there are a couple of tracks that I don't get excited about, but as a whole the album is still great.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars!!!
B000295SH4|4.0|The tracklisting here is exactly the same as the UK & Mexican versions of this album. I checked the American CD before buying this and I certainly came into conclusion that this is the best choice. Why? First of all, it includes the long version of Love To Love You Baby, which, as far as I know it's only included in the album of the same name, as well as the Casablanca Story box (and recently the import title \\"The Ultimate Collection\\"). The thing is that the above mentioned are expensive and/or hard to find. So this would represent the most affordable and convenient choice. <br /> <br />You also the get the full version of \\"On the Radio\\" which is another hard to find. <br /> <br />And last, but not least, you get the Single Version of \\"Theme From the Deep (Down Deep Inside)\\" as well as \\"Dinner with Gershwin\\". <br /> <br />Get it now, you won't be disappointed! <br /> <br />Track listing: <br /> <br />   1. Love To Love You Baby (Single Version) <br />   2. Could It Be Magic (Single Version) <br />   3. I Feel Love (Edit) <br />   4. Theme From The Deep (Down Deep Inside) <br />   5.

B00005JNTV|5.0|I just got back from seeing Sin City in a sold out theater and everyone walking out was talking about the many memorable scenes and performances. Mickey Rourke absolutely stole the show as Marv. Not only was his character the best of an amazing bunch of interesting folk throughout the film, but his story was also the strongest of the three. Other major standouts would have to be Elijah Wood in a silent, yet creepy role as the serial cannibal named Kevin, Bruce Willis as one of the few characters in the movie that proves to be more on the good side of right and wrong, Benicio Del Toro (great casting choice here: 2nd Best Performance Behind Rourke's Marv), Nick Stahl as a less creepy, but still effective version of a Kevin like pyscho, and Devon Aoki as the silent killer for the prostitutes. Now those are just the many standouts to me in a cast with only one semi-weak performance turned in by Brittany Murphy (but by her standards this is a decent one). There are also plenty of lovely ladies for guys like me to drool over, especially Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino who shows off her immaculate body. The visual look of the film is stunning of course and the direction is perfect. The violence might seem a little excessive, but it is so over the top that you will not be able to turn away. Great dialogue that stays true to the source and mananged to get the crowd I saw it with to chuckle at least a dozen times (better than most comedies I have seen of late). All in all, if you are of the male gender and you have not made plans to see this film this weekend, please stop reading this review and get to your local theater pronto. Sin City is a place I will be visting a couple more times before it leaves the big screen.
B00067189O|3.0|This album will always be a classic and is worth owning. You will feel cheated if you buy the dualdisc believing it is the highest resolution possible.   <br /> <br />The CD layer is probably the same master from the 1997 columbia/Legacy release. Yes? The 5.1 and stereo mixes on the dvd side are only dolby digital pcm.  With all the money that the studios (Sony/Columbia) have put into marketing the new dualdisc format you would think they could include a MLP 24 bit/96 kHZ or even 24 bit/192 kHz master of such a great work.  <br /> <br />Why not?  Is it because Sony is trying to push the SACD format,  and SACD is competing against advanced resolution DVD-A? I would not buy this for the acoustic quality of the mix.  Get the SACD instead.
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge is down right great! It's nice to have Mark Tremonti back tearing up the guitar again. I loved Creed, I even loved Scot Stapp's Voice, So I really hated to see them break up. When I heard That Mark was forming a new band I went nuts, I knew that they couldn't be better than Creed...Or that's what I thought! Alter Bridge is better than Creed in every way! I think Myles Kennedy is one of the best(If not the best singer in rock!) singers in rock. You will never get tired of this CD buy it now!  <br />  <br />
B00067BBSC|4.0|Like J. Moore's review, I agree that the concert video and sound is first-rate. Picture is high-definition, clear, and everything is well-lit. The sound is exceptionally crisp and clear. A great show for people who appreciate good musicianship and rock & roll. Skip the DVD extras - which are simply bad video footage of grown men acting like mindless teens - they take away from the good feelings of watching the concert.
0156027321|5.0|I had read the book jacket many times but thought the story would be too contrived and popular to be worth the read. However, I was simply not prepared for the beauty of the author's writing, as well as the wonderful, riveting ending. In truth, the story of the Life of Pi is not about Pi, the intelligent, thoughtful school boy but about how one can survive through believing in something and focusing one's efforts on a being, in this case the tiger. This of course sounds like a cliche but I really missed Richard Parker when he left the narrative, as did Pi, and felt a void after finishing the book. In fact, I did not think the trick ending, which left you wondering about another story, really leant anything to the book. The reader had been set up all along for the religious imagery which caught you by surprise at the ending, and the image of the tiger leaving the boat took my breath away. This is all that literature should accomplish--it is the author's vision of how one person gets through life.
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is one of those albums that just speaks to you, if you know how to listen.  Instrumentally wonderful, diverse, and just plain weird, this in my opinion ranks second only to \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", another hit or miss album.  I usually don't do song by song reviews, but I figure I will try something different in this one.  So here we go.... <br /> <br />1. One of These Days- This song starts out with a bassline and synthesizer phase and quickly turns into a rockin' instrumental tune.  Great use of the pedal steel with overdrive to create a screaming lead sound.  Excellent intro song.  <br /> <br />2. A Pillow of Winds- Dreamy acoustic number sounds exactly like its title, soft and dreamy.  You can almost close your eyes and be taken off into another world where things don't suck as bad as they do here.  Love the drone of the vocals, intentionally monotonous. <br /> <br />3. Fearless- Good song, slow standard Pink Floyd beat, but with nice vocal harmonies.  Not as good as some others on this album, but good nonetheless. <br /> <br />4. San Tropez- I love this song, and I have no idea why.  I'm not a big jazz fan (not because I don't appreciate the skill of the musicians, I just like structured music), so I don't understand why this song appeals to me so much.  Definitely a big change from any other Pink Floyd material they have ever done.  Nice simple but effective slide solo in middle, jazzy piano at end of song. <br /> <br />5. Seamus- Not sure why this is on this album.  Just Pink Floyd being their weird, tripped out selves.  I usually skip this song, nothing impressive here.   <br /> <br />6. Echoes- Maybe Floyd was trying to make you think the album was over with 'Seamus'.  This is one of their most impressive songs in their entire library.  Great mood, great instrumentals, and the vocals are just haunting.  For a good idea of how they do the instruments in the middle part, check out \\"Live at Pompeii\\" and they give you somewhat of an idea.  This is the perfect ending to a great album.   <br /> <br />This album is not for the fan of the radio-friendly Pink Floyd, but more the experimental Floyd.  Highly recommended.
068987474X|5.0|I seen the book on Oprahs show and I thought it was great. I've read some of the reviews on here and I have to say.  Sometime women see what the want to see.  We believe he really is busy or he don't have time, when he really isn't that into you.  It saves time and hurt feelings.  I suggest reading it and I promise you will blurt out \\"Been there!\\"
B00000AFGM|1.0|'rock is dead.'  yeah, and guess who is helping to kill it?  that's right, marilyn manson and his brand of kindergarten, no-talent garbage that he apparently doesn't even try to pass off as music.  how people like this can make money off of the poor, moronic public is beyond me.  wow, how controversial, he has t*ts on the cover.  he swears!!  oh my GOD!!  the devil is coming!!  oh, wait, it's just this poser trying to act hardcore and sh*t.  music isn't how you LOOK, it's how you SOUND.  don't buy this talent-free crap, for once in all of your miserable lives lead, don't follow!!  progressive 4 ever.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|I get the critiques that this movie is outlandish and full of coincidences. But who cares-I don't want to rent a movie that mirrors a regular life of carpooling and grocery shopping and working and parenting. Give me the romantic equivalent of a 40 car pile-up!     Some of the motivations and actions of the characters didn't quite jive with me at times. But I thought the sheer nastiness to the nth degree that all the characters indulged in(some more effectively than others) was quite entertaining.     Clive Owens character steals the show because his character is the least squeamish and the most ruthless and clever of all of them. He also delivers the best lines that make you want to press the rewind button repeatedly. It isn't often my husband and I are BOTH impressed with a particular actor in a movie.    Part of the entertainment comes from watching these little weasels act up, and part of the entertainment comes from the fact that we've all done some pretty crappy, manipulative, and underhanded things to the ones we \\"love\\" to-because we could.     I don't find this movie profound or high art or some dramatic study on love really. I thought it had a very biting, dark humor-my husband and I were laughing much more than sitting silent and sadly. I mean, watching Jude Law cry like a little girl was hilarious after everything he had done to everyone else. I thought the most interesting thing was how in many ways these two men-Law as an equal parts dreamy, disloyal, and selfish charmer and Owen as the ultimate alpha-male-were motivated to do things for or in reaction to eachother and the women in some ways were just a means to an end...(I think the women, especially Roberts, were much more elusive in nature as to their motivations). Just a devilish little movie with knockout acting, oh-no-she-didn't-oh-yes-she-did setups, and some lines that really make you laugh out lough(ie-Owen meeting Law for the first time, sizing him up, and saying, \\"he's a stringy little f.......\\")....
B00008H2LB|1.0|man, these guys are the definition of suck.  i wasn't even going to waste my time bashing them except for the encouragement of another LP-basher on this site who encouraged me to go ahead, let em have it.  rap rock sux, nu-metal sux, so i guess combining the two is ultra suck?  i dont know, but when i hear their whining singer and lack of instrumental capabilities on the radio (if someone else has the radio on, because i won't) i dont know whether to laugh or cry.  long live michael romeo, death to these jokes.
B00005JNTV|4.0|Traditional Film Noir meets Robert Rodriguez in this epic dramatization of Frank Miller's Graphic Serial, \\"Sin City\\".  The resulting picture is visually astounding and hauntingly dramatic. <br /> <br />Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller take us on journey through three separate stories that ultimatley intersect through out the movie. The stories include a man-hunt for the killer of a \\"Perfect Woman\\", an aging cop about to retire who has to complete that one last bust, and a group of women who rule the area of Basin City called \\"Old Town\\". <br /> <br />The direction and editing of this movie are no less than we would expect from Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez reminds us that he is extremly good at what he does. The whole film is shown in Black and White and seems to take place in the 1930's, preserving the feel of Noir.  To give it a modern twist, colors and cell phones were added in.  We see a woman in a red dress standing at the edge of a balcony, a man who's so evil his skin has turned a putrid yellow, and other more subtle touches, such as Alexis Bledsole's eyes and the flashlight as it shines on Clive Owen's face. <br /> <br />The over-the-top acting deserves an A+. If it were any other cast, I'd think it was just bad acting.  However, the A-List stars have taken the film \\"to the next level\\" (Sorry, I had to throw a Spy Kids quote in). It adds a fantasy feel to what otherwise would just be another dramatic movie.  It is similar to the acting in Molholland Drive during the dream sequence. Probably the best perfomance is done by Mickey Rourke as Marv, I didn't even recognize him st first. Hopefully Marv can do for Mickey what Cap'n Jack Sparrow did for Johnny. Elijah Wood also shows us that he can be more than just a \\"Hobbit from the Shire\\". <br /> <br />This movie contains strong violence. A man is beaten to death, and another is fed to a dog. There are suggestions of Child Molestation, Prostitution, and a couple of characters use Religion to justify cannibalism. Though there are some bloody sequences, most use a bright white goop to signify blood, looking more like a bird pooped on them. Like Kill Bill, body parts are sliced off non-chalantly, but unlike Kill Bill, it's kept below 100.  There is also some tongue-in-cheek comic relief. Watch for the bow and arrow scene. <br /> <br />Viewers who enjoy this movie will also like both Kill Bill Movies and \\"Pulp Fiction\\", by \\"Guest Director\\" Quentin Tarantino and \\"Once Upon A Time In Mexico\\" or \\"Desperado\\", Robert Rodriguez.  You may also want to check out some other Modern Noir Films like \\"Molholland Drive\\" (David Lynch) and \\"Never Die Alone\\", as well as Tradtional Film Noir flix, \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", \\"Notorious\\", and \\"The Maltese Falcon\\". <br /> <br />All in all this movie is a must see for Film Noir and Rodriguez/Taratino Fans alike.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|this isn't just a rip on d-12, but ALL RAP ARTISTS.  how can someone call themselves an 'artist' when all they do is start sh*t with everybody and represent their 'hood?  that sounds like an episode of the sopranos to me, not 'music'.  it also sounds like they realize there is nothing to their 'music' and are trying to create a lot of drama so people will have SOME reason to buy their records.  Last, music is more than a beat, it is melody, which rap lacks greatly.  this is commercial crap that they put out for people who can't discern good music from bad-whatever-this-is, and the record companies that put this crap out love you all for buying it!!  progressive 4 ever-
B000000WA4|5.0|Armed with an amazing set of musical palletes, keen voice arrangements and tones, The Smashing Pumpkins created an outstanding double -album wihile still ridding high on their accomplished and very commercialy successful third album that was released in 1993. The Smashing Pumpkins understood that their fame was at its highest point in the early 90's and the only why to further their accomplishemnts was to create the most expansive album as possible. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness qualifies as the most deeply seeded, provincial album of the 90's. While other great bands were creating similar works with the same aspects of rock, SP was, in my opinion, the best out of all of them. Some people consider The Smashing Pumpkins as the second wave that came out of the massive aura that Nirvana created. I dissagree with that notion with great respect to Nirvana and all of their talents, but SP was far more musically and lyricly gifted. The entire atmosphere that is present through both albums is driven int the minds of its listeners instantly. If you were quite young, like I was during this era, a feeling of nostalgia takes over. I think this is one of the most represenative albums of American music ever made. The Smashing Pumpkins deserve to be held in some of the same regard as such great English bands ssuch as Led Zeppelin, Yes, and The Cure. I'm not suggestin that SP is as talented as these bands, but they aren't far off!  When one perchases this album, they won't fully understand its importance and fantastical arrangements until they play both discs in thier entirety and in the running order. Only then does it become obviouse that The Samiashing Pumpkins have created on of America's gratest musical artworks of all time. I can't stress how perfect this album is. I feel that The Pumpkins surpassed the standards that Nirvana set for American rock bands in the early 90's. You'll never tire of it even though you'll listen to it everyday!, or even better, AT NIGHT!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Man, I still can't believe everyone is praising Green Day as the best thing since sliced bread.  Someone even went so far as to call them and Blink 182 \\"virtuosos\\".  Does anyone else understand what a joke this is?!?!?!  Does anyone else even know the definition of virtuoso?!?!  Probably nobody reviewing this album.  Anyhow, more of their same power chord crap, empty, talentless, boring.  If you are looking for virtuosos, try progressive metal, progressive rock, or classical, but don't look here, for GOD'S SAKE, DON'T LOOK HERE......
B000003TAB|5.0|Most critics and fans alike consider \\"In Utero\\" to be the next best representation of Nirvana next to \\"Nevermind\\", but I must say that while \\"In Utero\\" is a very good album, this just has more depth to it. There are only a few tracks on \\"Incesticide\\" that aren't worth your time, but the majority of this album is an essential listen in order to understand the influence that Nirvana has cast upon the majority of current Rock and punk bands. It wasn't meant to be released as a proper album, however I find it to be more meaningful than \\"In Utero\\" and the three songs that seem a bit dull are nowere near making this album unimportant. Seeing as there are 15 tracks on this one, it's sure to bring a great feeling of knowing what the spirit of Nirvana was really about.
B000001Y2U|1.0|this guy is just a pompous bag of douche.  i don't give a f*ck what he says about religion, he can bash it all he wants and it makes no difference to me, he and his \\"band\\" are just so incredibly untalented, that is why i hate this crap!!  this guy has a FOLLOWING!!  HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?  WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE HIM?  i don't wear black with black makeup and black fingernail polish and scream anguish at the world, and i know actual musical TALENT when i hear it, so i guess i'll never get it.
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero was the last album proper Nirvana released. They were still one of the most talented and important musical acts in the world, but the lack of this band's creative force can be heard slightly in the fact that this is their grungiest, loudest, and seemingly structureless album since Bleach.This in no way harms the great reputation the band had, but it makes one wonder what became of the excellent musical direction that was introduced to the world with \\"Nevermind\\". The similarities between Nirvana and   The Smashing Pumpkins tend to favore Nirvana, however it must be said that The Pumpkins proved to further advance what Nirvana created into something bigger. Looking back on In Utero now, it's easy to understand why it is still held in such high regard with Nevermind. This was the only proper fallow-up to Nevermind and was treated with a slightly overrated appreciation, but tht needed to happen. People weren't ready to say good-bye to Nirvana. This album does give you a lovely shiver whe it comes to its close. It almost seems as if the band knew they were putting an end to Nirvana's life. I highly recommend this album for two reasons: It's Nirvana's last and possibly thier greatest album; it is the end of an empire that could have still gone on into the present day. Due to the fact that Nirvana came to a sudden close in the early 90's, other popular bands such as The Smashing Pumpkins had to compensate for the void that Nirvana left, but I'll get into that on my reviews for The Smashing Pumpkins!
B000002UA2|4.0|This is an overall enjoyable album from the Floydmeisters, with a very trippy sound and good songwriting.  However, was \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" necessary?  The song is apparently just filler, and serves no real purpose.  It definitely doesn't bring the album together.  Would have been a five star album with a better song to tie the album together.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is, of course,  the best collection of songs that Niravna released during thier short, but highly accomplished career. However, you must buy \\"Incesticide\\" after you perchase \\"Nevermind\\". The two albums contain songs that were written at the same recording sessions. \\"Incesticide\\" should be regarded as a continuation of \\"Nevermind\\". The two complament eatch other perfectly. Nevermind is the obviouse 1st place occupier when it comes to Nirvana albums. It was recorded in smooth production sessions, displays the spirit of the 90's in perfect fashion, although I was only 4 years old when the album came out,it remeinds me of the early 90's. Everything you've heard about this album is absolutely true. Not a single fault can be found on this album.A must have! If you own any works of Nirvana at the present time, don't be surprised when you discover that the musical structure of \\"Nevermind\\"as well as the lyric writting presents itself on a highe level than any of their other records. I've read some rviews giving negative remarks towards Nevermind, but they have absolutely no validity whatsoever!
B000006TRV|3.0|I know everyone is going to rip me for this, but I don't give a f--k.  I have been a Pink Floyd fan as long as I can remember, and actually started out listening to this album.  I've always like this album, I don't hate it, but I have just one big complaint about it.  There is TOO MUCH ROGER WATERS.  This guy must have had the biggest ego in the world, to basically strongarm anybody else out of the writing process for this album (except for some measly writing credits to Gilmour) and take over kingship of the band.  And the result is a downhill slide from their earlier work.   <br />Being a guitarist, I just happen to like earlier work where the entire band was involved in the writing of the material, especially Atom Heart Mother, which I think is their best album ever, period.  If you are going to listen to this album, at least try to get your hands on a very rare CD, Pink Floyd \\"The Film\\", which I believe was a pirated version of \\"The Wall\\", which has all of the song versions from the movie, including \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" and others \\"The Wall\\" doesn't include.
B000050HTO|5.0|This is the Essential Bob Dylan. Containing his best radio hits on two cd's, in pretty much chronological order.  This is a nice place to start if you only plan on buying one Bob album ever, or you are on a limited budget and want more bang for your buck. This album combines 3 greatest hits albums plus adds some songs that would be placed on \\"Greatest Hits Vol. 4\\" (if there was such an album). If you plan on exploring Dylan's entire catalogue you should probably skip this. I am a huge Dylan fan (you will probably be in the same boat with me if you have a large collection of Dylan's stuff) these songs are the ones you end up skipping when listening to the studio albums they are on (because you've heard them so many times). Studio B sides are all a bit darker and more mysterious then the commercial common denominator A sides (contained here). But all in all if you haven't checked Dylan out...you should very soon. This is a good place to start. But for someone who wants to dive deeper 3 or 4 more dollars will get you either Bootleg 4, 5, or 6 (live versions (along with a bit of history) of most of these). Then you can get these songs when you buy the studio albums.
B000002U82|3.0|I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and first off I will say it is NOT because of this album.  I could give a lot of reasons and descriptions why I am not a big fan of this album.  Instead, I will give songs.  'On the Run', 'The Great Gig in the Sky', 'Money', and 'Any Colour You Like' just do not do it for me.  And since this is about half of the album, I give it only three stars.  Even the greatness of 'Time' and 'Us and Them' can't save this one.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is a great album for two reasons: <br />1. The length of the songs.  I believe it was Pink Floyd's intention to make an album that they would not be able to get one song off of for the radio, and I think they succeeded with that here.  With two songs at under two minutes and three at over ten, the three minute single is thrown by the wayside here.  However, there is a version of Pigs on the Wing that connects both parts one and two with a nice tasteful guitar solo, but I am not sure what album it comes from, if any, because I happened to find it on a sharing site.   <br />2. The quality of the songs.  Some bands it would seem make songs long just for the sake of making them long, instead of making actual long compositions.  I do not consider a song that is three minutes normally with a ten minute jam session to be a thirteen minute song.  Well, the songs on here are not jam sessions, they are well-structured, excellent songs.  Dogs, Pigs (Three Different Ones), and Sheep might be the strongest three song lineup on any of their albums.  Dogs is my personal favorite from this album, but every song is well written and superbly performed.  A must buy for any Floyd fan.
B00000DHZJ|3.0|This guy is definitely one of the most highly overrated guitar players, if not the most highly overrated, of all time.  I love his songwriting, but his solos are simple blues with a lot of screaming manipulated overdrive, and he plays SO sloppy!!  I would probably like Hendrix a lot more if he wasn't constantly called the best guitarist ever.  I think Jimmy Page (and many others, see my reviews on Symphony X) is way ahead of this guy!!  I've never seen a guitarist get so much respect for setting his guitar on fire.  I know everyone is going to rip me and say, you haven't heard ALL of his stuff.  Well, I have, including his \\"Blues\\" album.  If you want to hear blues done better, check out Stevie Ray Vaughan.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|just because you play all the instruments doesn't mean you play them well.  i can play drums well enough to be in nirvana but that doesn't mean i can play them well.  when music and fashion are mentioned in the same sentence, you know you are talking about a poser, not a musician.  real musicians are too busy studying theory and writing music to worry about trivial things such as fashion.  someone went so far as to say that she would name her firstborn child avril.  hears hoping that the child is a boy....        oh, and what she does cannot be called playing 'guitar' based on my knowledge of the instrument.      and to the person titled 'avril lavigne's #1 fan, it is obvious you must be a girl of no more than 4 years old who has never picked up an instrument in your entire life if you think she is the best guitar player ever.  a blind LEPER with one arm could play her songs with about two hours of practice.  next time you feel like you have something important or groundbreaking to say, try to wait until you're not in diapers anymore, and at least have graduated to the new Huggies training pants.Next thing I guess we'll hear about is how she's better than Mozart or Chopin.  Geeeez........................
B000021XR5|4.0|This album is something you perhaps shouldn't buy if you're a fresh STP fan, you should start with 'Core' and 'Purple', after that you'll love the band, and you will, not only like this one, but also appreciate certain songs more, cause they're STP. I'm trying to say that for example 'Sour Girl', is an awesome song, but if this pop tune was by Robbie Williams, you wouldn't appreciate it as much, cause he's a all-radio popper. The point is, as a true fan, you start appreciating STP's newer style, cause if you expect Core and Purple-like sounds, there ain't many, and there ain't this big radio-like catchiness in any of the songs really, but they're still great in every way! they're just out of that catchy verse-chorus-verse type thing, you know? Lyrically, singer Scott Weiland is pretty much himself, nothing really knew when it comes to words, but his singing style and overall being has changed, he digs the high notes even more, and he brings his feminine side up a little more than before (well, Tiny Music pretty much equal), but that's only a good thing, the little mystique of the whole man is just great! he's not here to please the radio, he's being totally himself at all emotions! The rest of the band I guess are overall good, not showing anything spectacular though, I was more into Dean's guitars on 'Purple', now it's more a Scott's own show, just like 'Tiny Music', but that's not really a bad thing, I don't know, for some people the singing isn't even important, but personally I listen more to Scott Weiland's voice and words, and the music isn't AS important. Okay, 'Sour Girl', very poppy, but damn good! just so..stylish! 'Down', heavy but slow, never really liked this, but it's okay. 'No Way Out', a bit too nu-metal-like, and lyrically weak, but it's an entertaining and creepy song though. 'Glide', a feel good, dreamy kinda song, just so beautiful, makes you wanna get high perhaps when you listen to it, it reminds of 'Still Remains'. 'I Got You', and oldish typercok song, with folk and blues influence, works fine, it's so contageous, but again, a song you wouldn't START liking STP of. 'Church On Tuesday', a very average STP song, has that bit of stale feeling, but again, magically good! 'Atlanta', shows Weiland's magical singing talent, this is an AMAZING ballad!!! The rest of the songs all kinda neat too. This isn't probably STP's best album, but it's their most experimenting one, and unlike many bands who change their style, Stone Temple Pilots don't fail to still sound great!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is not about music, it's non existent. It's about what it represents. <br />A marketing product sold to the pre-pubescent youth of today. <br />Give them Mac Donald, Cheesy puffs, Pepsi...Buy, buy, buy for God's sake.  <br /> <br />Everyone is in for the loot : Music companies, radio, MTV, Music Stores. Some are surprised but it has been like this since the dinosaurs roamed the earth.  <br /> <br />It makes me slightly ill, especially since I am convinced they would make as much money developing real artists.
B0000584V3|3.0|i just had to hear this band after reading everyone's reviews about how they are musically the best band in the universe, etc.  strangely, i did not come to this same conclusion.  instrumentally, they are good, not great, and they do have an original sound.  but those vocals, how can anyone stand that?  it's hard to listen to the music with a distraction like that.  it sounds like the lead \\"singer\\" is choking on a dick while trying to sing.  recommended if you like death metal screams, because the band can play, but beware the vocals.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|truely his best recording every song is a hit, and there is a song for everyone.if you never listened to Ray before, do yourself a favor and listen to this one. It's a shame but to me his last was his best.
B00005AFMT|5.0|23 Years later this is still a stunning album.  The guitar work is incredible - if you can play this my hat is off to you.  Holds up well even after all these years.  Who knoew Steve (Adrian Belew)  could sing.   Very easy listening - Catch the boys on the old Friday's TV show and see RF Smile! <br /> <br />Discipline is the key to Joy
B000089RVX|5.0|this is the best album i own, the songs are just simply great and it seems that the band has put there heart and soul into making this album. I first got hooked to evanescence when daredevil came out and i herd Bring Me To Life, that was such a good song, i then got the album and noticed how good it was. the best song on the album is My Immortal without a differ, it is simply beautiful. i cannot wait for the next eavenscence album.
B00006FXB6|5.0|The best rock and roll album in recent memory.  No excuses, no appologies - its the real thing.  This stays in my CD player - turned up to 11...........
B000BCKFWK|5.0|\\"Frank Miller's Sin City\\" is a world where the heroes can take a whole series of punches as well as deliver them, where justice has nothing to do with either mercy or the cops, and the system is crooked from top down to pretty near the bottom of the barrel. The dames are still worth dying for and some of them might even be angels or goddesses, but others can defend themselves quite well without anyone's help.  Still, this is a world where protecting women is hard-wired into the psyches of guys like John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke), and Dwight (Clive Owen). If you fail to protect a dame, then somebody has to pay and in a way that will make the scum bucket think Hell is heaven when you finally let them go straight to there. This movie is rated R for \\"sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue,\\" but that is most assuredly an R that is a whole lot closer to NC-17 than it is to PG-13.<br /><br />I am not particularly happy that when I bought \\"Frank Miller's Sin City\\" on DVD as soon as it came out that it was the stripped down version and that a few months later, in time for Christmas no less, we finally get the \\"Recut, Extended, Unrated\\" DVD set.  But studios are making money off of this double-dipping and if I could hold off for years on \\"Titanic\\" I should have been able to do the same thing with this one, so shame on me.  But the good news is that (a) I did not have to pay for the upgrade and (b) the difference between the two DVDs, without the discount, is only ten bucks and you will more than get your money's worth here because to ease our collective pain Robert Rodriguez made sure that this 2-disc set goes the extra mile.  That is clear as soon as you open up the box and discover it includes a mini-version of Frank Miller's \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" (my \\"mini\\" I mean the book is slightly larger than the size of a paperback novel).  This is a good choice not only because it is the first \\"Sin City\\" graphic novel, but also because it is about Marv and as Marv Mickey Rourke steals this movie from Bruce Willis and the rest.  So already you have account for a good chuck of the extra ten dollars you are spending and then we get to the super-loaded two DVDs.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains the original theatrical release (uncut, unextended, rated).  Your other \\"Sin City\\" DVD is made superfluous because this has three commentary tracks: co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller talking primarily about working with the actors; Rodriguez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino (eventually) talking more about the technical aspects of the film; and an audio track of the reaction of an audience in Austin to a screening of the film.  The featurettes cover how Frank Miller was convinced to make the film, getting Tarantino to play with shooting a film digitally, and then separate looks at the cars, props, special effects and costumes of the film.  There is then a \\"Sin-Chroni-City\\" interactive game that looks at how the three novels that make up the first \\"Sin City\\" movie cross each other, and the teaser and theatrical trailers.  The two directors having a conversation while screening the film is the best of the extras on this disc, simply because I like the stories of the production a bit more than the details on how the film was made, but both are excellent commentary tracks.<br /><br />Disc 2 offers the recut and extended theatrical release and it is not the deleted scenes being worked back in for the \\"extended\\" part that matters here but rather the \\"recut\\" part.  That is because Rodriguez has recut the movie into the three graphic novels, \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" \\"The Big Fat Kill,\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard,\\" along with the short story \\"The Customer Is Always Right\\" from \\"Babe Wore Red\\" and the epilogue Rodriguez and Miller came up with for the end of the film.  With the movie broken up this way it is even easier for you to watch a \\"chapter\\" with Miller's graphic novel in front of you to seethe extent to which they actually did shoot the book on this film.  Of course the special features on this disc include new installments of Rodriguez's 15-Minute Film School and 10-Minute Cooking School (breakfast tacos).  There is also a performance by Bruce Willis with a band at the \\"'Sin City' Live\\" cast and crew party at Antones filmed by Rodriguez with the digital camera.  For cinema buffs the two treats are the movie in high-speed green screen, so you can see how they actually shot everything (tip of the hat to Rodriguez for protecting his cast on the brief nudity in this version), and a 14-minute uninterrupted take from Tarantino's segment (Dwight and Jackie Boy in the car on the way to the tar pits) that allows a great look at how actors and directors work when shooting digitally.<br /><br />I already thought \\"Frank Miller's Sin City\\" was a five-star movie that not only sets the standard for what film noir will be in the 21st century but also advances the cause of digital filmmaker.  That it brings Miller's characters and story to life while remaining faithful to his artistic style is a bonus for those whose introduction to \\"Sin City\\" was the graphic novels, but that was what Miller and wanted and what Rodriguez delivered with his little test run.  If you held out on getting this movie on DVD until the special features version was available it was well worth your wait, and if you have been duped into giving the studio even more of your money for this upgrade you will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that Rodriguez delivered for you as well.u to see the extent to which they actually did shoot the book on this film.

B000002G23|4.0|A great collection.  Goood musicianship and a great look into the functioning of a band - these guys were broken up by success, <br /> <br />This set covers the gamut of music that was the Police.   Pop, New Wave, Reggae.  It's a bit of everything.  Buy it if you are interested in the Police.
B0002KQNL8|3.0|I gave it three stars because I love the movie!!! The DVD however, was disappointing. <br /> <br />I watched ROTLD series several times when I was younger and I loved them.  I knew, now that I'm a little older, that I wouldn't appreciate this movie the same way I did then.  It's not the greatest or even great, but it's intelligently cheesy and quircky.  The third was good, but it wasn't fun like this one and the first one.  I have read the reviews left by others complaining about the soundtrack being different from the original.  I figured I could live with this, though, so I purchased this DVD.  I was very wrong.  I went to the french soundtrack and listened to the original, and YES, it really makes the movie.  This new soundtrack has parts of the old in it with a slap-back echo effect on it.  The effect was not even timed right.  Did they get a child to redo this?  And when the zombies are coming out of the ground, the music sounds like a midi file.  Nothing more.  It's worthless and it has really took something away from this movie that made it fun to watch.  I have no idea why they did this, but it was a mistake and if I could return this DVD, I would.  But if you really loved this movie go ahead and get it, but you've been warned.  Hopefully they will package these movies in a box set one day with all the original content.
B000002MT0|2.0|COME was released during a rough time in Prince's career, possibly the height of his quarrels with Warner Bros. (his long-time label). Listening to this, you get the feeling that Prince may have released it as a 'f*** you' to the WB. He really was writing and recording great material at the time, and performing great concerts, but you wouldn't know it from listening to COME. <br /> <br />Regardless, there's one epochal cut here, \\"Loose!\\" A thunderous stomp that's one part hard-funk, one part industrial, I've heard some compare it to a Nine Inch Nails production, but it's totally Prince. As much as I hate this album, I always come back to \\"Loose!\\" You can probably purchase it through online vendors like iTunes for roughly a dollar, otherwise, get one of the cheap, used copies here (as of this writing there are a few well under $2 before shipping). <br /> <br />Hopefully WB or Prince will make \\"Loose!\\" available on a compilation, rendering COME obsolete, but until that happens, the disc is worth listening for that one track alone.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is one of the best recordings to come a long in a long time (as shown by it winning the grammy and being one of itunes top 100 albums).  Any body who claimed that the show was bad, doesn't it make u feel stupid that the show has like 30 million dollars in presales?  I've seen it twice, both times with Idina, and i feel like this is one of the best shows on broadway and i have recommended it to everyone i know.  Anyone who doesn't like it, there's something wrong with you.
B00005OM4N|3.0|This self-titled album is a huge step away from her traditional bubble-gum pop music, and is the beginning of the process of britney growing up, and explanding her style of music. <br />While the album is still bubblegum pop it is definitely more mature, more sexier, and slightly more darker than her usual music. <br />Fans of Britney will be surprised by the raspiness of her voice, the sexiness in her music.  <br />Songs like \\"I'm not a girl, not yet a woman\\" is an indication of her own life, and how much she has changed in the years since she came to us with \\"hit me baby one more time\\". <br />It shows a wistfulness, an eagerness to grow up at the same time a slight reluctance. <br />The album has become less pop though, and more music that you can dance to. <br />Admittingly there are tracks that take a while to get used to, such as her cover of \\"I love rock n roll\\". It was a shock to hear her version of it, but eventually it grows on you. Although older fans of the song may disagree with that. It's not the best version in the world, but it is Britney well being Britney, and bringing the pop into the song. Younger fans of britney will probably love this song. <br />With songs such as Boys, I'm a slave for you, Bombastic love the album oozes of dancebeat numbers, sexiness, but there's the touch of innocence in \\"Not a girl, not yet a woman\\". <br />Britney seems to have taken a step in the right direction with her music though, as she and her record company know that she can not appeal to young girls forever, and needs to find her niche in the grown up market, and this album might just do that for her. <br />Some of the tracks are very clever, such as the cleverly written \\"Cinderella\\" which describes how a girl realises that she's not going to be used, or treated like a doll on a guy's chain for the rest of her life. <br />This album, as mentioned before, is a grown up album. The music is catchy, and take a step in the direction of R and B. A very clever move on behalf of britney and her team. <br /> <br />
0743490304|5.0|I'm a relatively slow reader, and finished this in 3 days.  Couldn't put it down....if you liked Brown's other works, you'll love this.  I promise!
B000002KDS|5.0|I love it, I am a slipknot fan, a Metallica fan, as well as a Led Zeppelin fan and a Guess Who fan...just to give you an idea.  My dad suggested this CD, since I picked up Alice's greatest hits...I LOVE IT.  Billion Dollar Babies is good too, but this one is defiantely Alice's best!  Pick it up for cheap!
0060575816|3.0|Sabriel is a classic case of an idea being strong enough to make up for rather poor writing and characterisation.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the concept behind the novel is strong and well-conceived. It is rare to find a fantasy novel that incorporates both the mechanical and the magical as this one does, or that has put as much thought into how the system of magic actually works. For me, the most interesting parts of the book were those that explained the necromancer's art, the use of the bells and the nine gates of Death.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the execution does not quite live up to the concept.<br /><br />Firstly, Sabriel is simply not a believable or a particularly interesting character. Her emotions do not feel genuine, nor does she show much real iniative at any point of the novel. She comes across as a wooden puppet who is jerked from place to place by Nix, and made to react in certain ways.<br /><br />Moreover, there have been rather too many similar girl protagonists of late, who are cool, collected and competent beyond what they logically should be. I think of Pratchett's Tiffany in Wee Free Men and A Hat Full of Sky among many others.<br /><br />That brings me onto my second criticism -- the deus ex machina nature of many of the events. It seems that, whenever Sabriel gets into any slightly difficult situation, she either uses her magic or is rescued by another person. She never has to use an ounce of initiative to save herself.<br /><br />Finally, the descriptive writing is pretty weak. Nix creates the impression of majestic, frightening or beautiful places, but doesn't make them live, doesn't make me feel as if I am standing in them with his characters.<br /><br />That said, Sabriel is fairly entertaining and worth reading on a rainy day. However, it is not the classic that it has been made out to be.
B00002Z88D|5.0|True, it's basically a greatest hits CD. And not a great representation of the greatest hits, at that - it leaves off most of the greatest hits! In fact, the CD takes too much from Re/Load and the Black album (I wish they replaced those songs with tracks like To Live is to Die, or Sanitarium). <br /> <br />Still, this CD is easily one of my favorites of all time (in any genre). The symphony adds a whole new dimension to the product we all know and love. In fact, it adds a new dimension to what we didn't really love. I wasn't a big fan of \\"Until it Sleeps\\", but with the symphony backing it, it becomes one of my favorite Metallica songs ever. The symphony only strengthens the concert favorite Battery, and somehow, it actually makes Master of Puppets and For Whom the Bell Tolls better than ever before. The symphony helps that much...going back to listen to these tracks after hearing them on S&M is like hearing them with the headphones half plugged in - something is missing, because the symphony blends in to the music so well. <br /> <br />This isn't an album for thrash folks, and so many true fans of Metallica feel betrayed by the band's willingness to work with a symphony. But they're wrong for doing so. Maybe they have legitimate beef with the band for \\"selling out\\" with the Loads, but this is much different. You don't have to like rock, metal, thrash or symphony orchestras to love this. The music packed onto this album, which was all recorded live, is fantastic (do yourself a favor and check out the live performance). This is the only Metallica album I'd recommend to my friends and family (they wouldn't like the rest). <br /> <br />It would be a perfect album, except for the fact that they (IMO) picked bad songs to begin with. Check out the number of selections by CD: <br /> <br />Kill 'em All: 0 <br />Ride the Lightning: 2 <br />Master of Puppets: 2 <br />...And Justice For All: 1 <br />Black album: 5 <br />Load: 4 <br />Reload: 3 <br />Other: 3 <br /> <br />Don'tlet that discourage you, though. S&M will make you appreciate the Loads, at least a little bit...
B000002KIT|5.0|This is a great live album - perhaps the best ever.  The band sounds at its tightest, as it should since the shows were from the band's peak period in late 77 and early 78.  The live versions of the songs outshine their studio originals and several are just perfect!  What really makes the band special is that all 4 were good musicians - particularly Brian Downey on drums.  Also for those who like wah in their guitars, Brian Robertson was one of the best in this regard.   <br /> <br />Now to address the dubbing issue - you need not worry about it lacking a true live feeling.  The audience sounds are all original, as are the drums and most of the guitars (a few touchups on the solos - exactly how much is disputed).  Really, only the vocals and bass were significantly redone.  I have several Lizzy live performances from this era and there is very little difference other than clarity in the sound (KBFH in Philly 77 is a good example).  You don't want to miss \\"Johnny The Fox\\", \\"Still in Love With You\\", \\"Don't Believe A Word\\", \\"Warrior\\" and the rest!!
B000002H6C|5.0|I listened to this thing quite a bit before I \\"got\\" it. I liked \\"One\\" after my first listen, but songs like Blackened and Frayed Ends of Sanity took some getting used to. Still, I'm glad I put in the effort. <br /> <br />This is Metallica at their absolute peak. People will tell you Master of Puppets was the band's zenith, but they're dead wrong. The band improved all the way up until this point, and although this album's tracks aren't all megahit Enter Sandmans and Sanitariums (although the title track should be considered such a megahit), this is the best material I've ever heard from them. <br /> <br />It's really incredible to see the progression of Metallica, from short and fun tracks like Motorbreath, to longer, more complex offerings like Fade to Black and Master of Puppets, until something like ...And Justice For All (title track). Makes you wonder how that could all lead into the Black album...
B0002858YS|3.0|First of all, to all who read my reviews on Franz Whatchamacallit and Modest Mouse and said they weren't helpful, FORGET YOU!!!!! Now as far as the Killers go, they are a terrific band. I mean sure they have bad voices but you can't fault em for that. And they have good, solid sounds that make them worthy of my respect. They are the next big thing because girls want them, and guys won't stop listening to Brandon complaine about girls. As long as there are problems, the Killers will be there to tell you.
B00005RRG9|5.0|This is a true classic from beginning to end.  I am 41 years old and have loved this movie all my life.  I would have given anything to have Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith as my parents.
B00006690G|3.0|I'm a guy that doesen't listen to rap that much and when I do I only like about 50% of it, so it has to be pretty good for a middle-class, white guy like me to like it, which just happens to be the case with me and the eminem show. <br /> <br /> So let's start with the tracks you need to know about. <br />1.Horrible, stupid and makes no sense 1/5 <br /> <br />2.White America is a good rap/rock/pop song and it proves that Eminem can rap and rock at the same time 5/5 <br /> <br />4.Em, once again goin' after Mama, just in a different style of music 3/5 <br /> <br />5.Bush under attack(automaticly a good song)5/5 <br /> <br />10.This funny song with a great beat from Dre  almost makes up for the lack of talent in6(skit), 7, 8, 9 5/5 <br /> <br />11.Funniest Skit ever done on any CD, in which Paul warns Em about guns 5/5 <br /> <br />12.This is a touching, breathtaking song in which Em samples \\"Dream on\\" 5/5 <br /> <br />13.every man can relate to this song 4/5 <br /> <br />17.Dre and Timbaland warn you in this song to not mess wit' them(it also has a very good beat) 5/5 <br /> <br />Now I know I left out 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, and20 but that's because they don't matter. I mean yeah they all had good beats but I'd give them all 1/5 <br /> <br />Overall 39/100 <br />But I would still suggest buying it because of the good songs on this CD, but it's not his best work
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I love the parallel relationships, and how they show the characters learning and growing through these experiences. The dialogue is fast, witty and amazing. We try and catch all of the references, but confess that many pass us by the first viewing or so. Fun to watch on so many levels, even when it makes me cry....and they always make me think.
B000001OAA|5.0|I'm 19 now, and I got this cd when I was about 15. I still love it! I've been listening to it more and more lately so why not come on here to tell you about how cool it is:      1. Supervixen -This is a sexy track. It starts fast, becomes sorta smooth and slow again once Shirley starts singing then all of a sudden BAM! The chorus breaks in and just rocks.     2. Queer -This song is quite mysterious, chilling, dark. Shirleys voice is guarented to grab your attention.     3. Only Happy When It Rains -For anyone who loves the rain, this is the song for you. Everything about it rocks: vocals, the beat, lyrics. Its about finding a comfort in pain.     4. As Heaven Is Wide -Whoa, this ones different. Its kind of dark also, but good. Has a spinning, almost techno dizzy dance vibe to it, but it's interesting.      5. Not My Idea -An angry track. Something you will love to sing along to. Lots of emotion in the music and the vocals of this song. \\"This is not my idea of a good time!\\"      6. A Stroke Of Luck -This ones one of the slower tracks. Its beautiful but quite sad, despite the title. Although it is very emotional and intense. A beautiful tune that should soothe your ears.     7. Vow -This ones sounds very cool on your headphones! The beat is very trippy though, so be careful. It's another angry kind of song, and it's also intense.    8. Stupid Girl -Wow! What is it about this song? The beat towards the beginning is just really intense and beautiful. The lyrics are about a girl who doesnt believe in anything. This is one of my all time favorite songs. I highly reccommend this one.      9. Dog New Tricks -This one simply rocks. It grew on me the more I listened to it though. The chorus is very cool, you'll want to sing along to it, Shirley sounds angry.    10. My Lover's Box -I love this track! Her voice is very soft and whispery towards the beginning, but as soon as the drums break in, she starts to get really emotional in the chorus. This is one song I can not get sickof.     11. Fix Me Now -The guitar in this one sounds really cool. The vocals are a bit quiet at first but get louder towards the chorus. This is an interesting mix of music though. Pop, yet rock. Give this one a chance though.    12. Milk -This ones a bit more downtempo. A very, cool, freshing, chilled back out song. \\"I am cool...cool as the deepest ocean.\\" Her voice during this song is just beautiful as well, she really sings her heart out. It's one of my favorite tracks.    In conclusion, I'm telling you, don't miss out on this great cd! Garbage is an original band, with rocking vocals, lyrics, beats, and they are intense as I have mentioned many times. Also check out \\"Version 2.0.\\" If you like this album, you'll you should love that one as well. Also, despite the pretty pink feather boa cover, this isnt just chick music. I know plenty of guys who love this band, and, as you can tell by the good reviews, you should really pick up this great cd.
B00004CWO8|5.0|As a hard-core classical ballet fan, I didn't know what to expect out of this \\"modernized-yet-it-isn-'t-quite-ballet\\" performance.  I got the first glimpse of Adam Cooper -- who danced the lead role of the male Odette/Odile in this performance -- in \\"Billy Elliott\\" (where Cooper made a cameo role as the adult Billy).  Naturally I was curious and wanted to see more, so I got this DVD. Wow -- I am very impressed.  Adam Cooper's performance is ASTOUNDING. He, and him alone, is reason enough for me to watch the performance.  I wish I could say the same for the rest of the cast -- they were pretty good, but none had the charm and stage presence of Cooper. But that's why he has the lead role, right?  This is one performance where I can watch over and over again.
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|... but strip the clothes off and this CD is just plain dull.    I bought this album on an impulse after hearing one of their songs on the radio, and thinking to myself \\"Hey... maybe pop music is getting better\\". On the first two listens, I couldn't help but enjoy the mix of songs on this album. They are catchy and seemed to offer far more than the standard radio fare... until about day two.    The songs very rapidly lose whatver edge they were produced (and marketed) to have, and once you see through the packaging there is very little left to enjoy. This music offers nothing new to be discovered on repeated listenings, and instead becomes progressively more and more unbearable (i.e. tedious and horribly boring). I can barely even listen to an entire song now. That's when you realize that this is nothing but the same old s*** being unloaded on us - it is derivative pop music, flashy but ultimately empty (and soon to be sold to the used CD store). I actually really wanted to like this album, and if I'd reviewed it the first day my conclusions would be very different. Reviewers who talk about this being fun and catchy (etc) are by no means wrong - but it has very little lasting appeal. Maybe this is the type of album you can put on once every couple months, but to me that is not what makes good music. I can hear \\"Outkast\\" in a store and think it is kind of catchy but it is still pretty useless. Bah.    All in all, this CD is just one more product of the current \\"indie\\" music trend which has very little to do with innovation or quality. I'm not a music snob, but my \\"fun\\" music even needs a little more than this.
B00005JNTV|4.0|...oh, DID SHE EVER. Truer words have never been spoken. It should be illegal to have curves like that. Someday I will make Jessica Alba mine. Ok, I had to get that off my chest. <br /> <br />I'll first say that I have never read a \\"Sin City\\" book. I've certainly heard of it, but it has never appealed to me (no disrespect to any long-time fans). But I heard enough about this movie to become interested, especially because of the visuals. After seeing it yesterday, I can safely say that one does NOT have to be familiar with the books in order to like this film. I found myself fascinated throughout the whole movie by the excellent visuals, as I was when watching \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" although it has to be said that \\"Sky Captain\\" was mainly for the kiddies in terms of the level of violence, whereas \\"Sin City\\" is a far cry from being kid-friendly.  <br /> <br />Which brings me to the violence in this film. Yes, it is brutal and graphic. However, there are two things which keep the violence level below the in-your-face, sick-to-your-stomach level that it was in movies like \\"Kill Bill.\\" For one, virtually all of \\"Sin City\\" is in black & white. So the blood isn't realistic-looking. In fact it looks like white CGI in most scenes. Even the most graphically violent scenes such as the quadruple amputation and the beheadings have a certain \\"cartoonish\\" look to them, which of course is the entire point of this movie. And the second reason why the violence isn't so shocking is because a lot of it is pure tongue-in-cheek. When you have people basically act as if nothing has happened after their hand gets sliced off or after an arrow goes through their torso, you know it isn't supposed to be taken seriously. But again, that's all part of the fun of \\"Sin City.\\"  <br /> <br />In terms of acting, I have no complaints. And I certainly have no complaints about the female eye-candy either, especially Rosario Dawson and (you guessed it) Jessica Alba. Although all women are either hookers and/or strippers, they're capable of kicking serious a$$ and using their blades to the serious misfortune of anyone who crosses them. <br /> <br />I had a lot of fun with this movie and would recommend it with no reservations. In terms of visuals alone, it is pure brilliance. It is stylish, well-paced, well-directed, and as cliche as it sounds, just plain *cool*. Don't wait for DVD-see this movie on the BIG SCREEN.

B00005V3Z4|3.0|a long list of teen movie & existential cliches.    Start with an update of Occurrence at Owl creek Bridge mixed with a 'Lathe of Heaven' twist living in a supended world beyond reality. Make Donnie a 'troubled kid' it gives him reason not to feel at home in the world. take from Rebel without a Cause, Blackboard Jungle, Breakfast Club, My So Called Life --- every  teen angst plot known to moviedom is dumped into this story, 'my parents don't understand me', over bearing teachers, bullies, hypocritical moralizers, the only 'cool' teacher fired by the school system, the girl fiend who has even more problems than you. Then some pseudo-science mumbo jumbo about worm holes and time travel, some pointless 'weirdness' to give it that arty profound aura and top it off with a 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' type ending that leaves the movie in limbo. Was it all a dream, was Donnie completely delusional, was it 'magic', did the director run out script and need a quick out? And why is Donnie so troubled, he seems to have a pretty good life on average, his bleak view is never explained or justified. This movie makes a great leap into the deep dark end of the pool of the human conscious, but run out air long before it returns to the surface.    Darko Shmarko - I agree anybody who thinks this movie is brilliant and original needs to expand their literary horizons
B000002GVO|5.0|The Eagles Hotel California was one of the first compact discs I ever bought. Being a young college student with little money, I reserved my CD purchases to only the most worthy of albums. This criteria was both quality of sound and artistry. Hotel California had it all: top rate musicianship, excellant songwriting, and great sonic production. That's why it gets 5 stars. The remastered sound quality on this 2004 release brings it right up to modern levels. What I don't have anything good to say about is the packaging! You cannot tell the remastered version from the 20 year old original that I owned! Everything is identical. You get NO new liner notes, No new pictures, and NO bonus tracks! Warner Brothers didn't even have to reprint new cd booklets, cause their the same! How CHEAP can you get. It's just another case of the music industry ripping off the consumer. If you want to see how remasters are supposed to be done, check out Rhino Records releases (such as Foreigner) and Legacy Recordings (Heart, Janis Joplin, etc.)
630521610X|2.0|Dimension/Miramax/Buena Vista is an interesting combination. Miramax as a DVD division of Buena Vista (aka- Disney), usually turn out excellent DVD's. However, Dimension distributed the film Scream, and they are usually called upon to produce the lackluster second-rate material that comes Miramax's way (Dolph Lundgren films, and endless sequels to the Hellraiser, Halloween, and Children of the Corn franchises). And Dimension films on DVD usually get the same treatment Buena Vista's Touchstone and Hollywood studios- crap. Yes, usually widescreen. But the transfers are nearly always lackluster and the discs contain absolutely no features whatsoever.<br /><br />So here comes Scream on DVD, and it is with almost no consideration whatsoever, that the version of this film we are left with is not very good at all. This is not the definitive version of Scream, not by a long shot. This studio, regardless of it's having been founded by Miramax and partly operated by the Weinsteins themselves, has taken it upon themselves to butcher this truly exceptional and excellent horror-thriller.<br /><br />Most VHS copies of the film were of the uncut, unrated version of the movie which contains 3 key scenes of extended gore. 1: Steve the footballer boyfriend's intestines spill out of his torso and flow over his lap while he squirms in the chair, whereas in the cut version we see his guts just sitting on his lap. 2: Kenny the cameraman's throat is slit in extreme-closeup and blood trickles all the way down to the collar of his shirt, whereas the cut version both removes a closeup shot of the shock in his eyes as the knife slices him, and shortens the trickle of blood by more than half of it's full-duration. 3: The killers slice each other up. The cut version removes about 3 shots of Billy cutting up Stu, and also a frame of Sidney's father next to a puddle of Stu's blood on the floor as it drips from his arm, that seems to also have tiny chunks of flesh in it.<br /><br />These cuts hurt the film a lot, since it's been argued by many hardcore horror fans that Scream doesn't appeal to the gorefans when it really has a lot going for it in that department. Plus, the psychological aspects of the film are hurt by alternating points of view away from what's happening to the killers and showing Sidney's reaction instead, also shortening that so we don't even see how Sidney is handling this. In both versions, we get that Sidney is upset and repulsed by what she sees. And no more in this cut version.<br /><br />Then, even in Dimension's re-release of Scream to DVD in the 2000 Scream DVD Trilogy boxset, they couldn't manage to make Scream's widescreen transfer anamorphic. Which itself has been enough of an error that Universal saw fit to re-release their The Thing: Collector's Edition on DVD. Dimension/Buena Vista saw fit though to give the fans a few nice little extra bonus features- like several trailers, over a half dozen TV spots, a special FX conceptual art photo gallery, cast/crew profiles, and a really dinky little trivia section that reads strongly on the NO DUH! register for fans of this series.<br /><br />The audio commentary with Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson is a carryover from the UNRATED laserdisc edition of the film, and is a gem. Because these participants don't know it, but what they end up adding is the ONLY SIGNIFICANT making-of/behind-the-scenes info Scream fans have ever received. Oh yeah, I forgot there are a few more features- 2 very brief behind-the-scenes footage clips set to really bad 'alternative' songs, and a Q&A with the cast and crew as they answer 2 questions (\\"What's your favorite scary movie?\\" and \\"Why do people like scary movies?\\").<br /><br />More needs to be said about the audio commentary. A lot of horror fans have said some really stupid things about Wes Craven, and it's really not fair since a lot of serious film fans (people who usually turn their noses up at horror films) don't regard him as a quality filmmaker either. This commentary proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Wes Craven is probably the greatest director horror has ever seen, and an accet to the creative community. Especially because his insights both as having over 25 years experience as a filmmaker and as a college-degree psychology teacher/professor, are some of the most home-hitting to why horror gets so little respect and why it is so important as a film genre.<br /><br />Also the audio commentary gives us Kevin Williamson at his most talkative regarding the conception of Scream, and is a very valuable note since it is without a doubt his only quality work as a screenwriter. Wes and Kevin together are a truly powerful couple of experts, Wes's experience makes up for what Kevin lacks. And this commentary no doubt gives us a lot of food for thought on why a good deal of the scenes in this film are some of the most daring and groundbreaking to be tried in a horror film in nearly 2 decades. But there are a couple disturbing gaps of silence (though they aren't nearly as long on repeat viewings), and it still manages to leave the viewer with a lot of questions.<br /><br />I was hoping that the popularity of the new Craven-Williamson film Cursed would give Dimension/Buena Vista reason enough to seriously considering releasing Scream again in an amamorphically-enhanced widescreen version- of the UNRATED video/laserdisc version. Then again, maybe not... But there are reasons to have hopes high either way: The Weinsteins recently finished splitting with Disney, and get to keep the Dimension films name & catalog of films. Maybe this alone is enough to get the definitive version of Scream out there...<br /><br />The Trilogy Boxset is a must-buy if you're a fan of this series. Since Dimension was more than stingy the first two times around with bonus features, there's a bonus disc with 4 and a half minutes of hilarious outtakes, a really fluffy 30-minute featurette on the making of the film that has the feel of a slightly more personal talking-head promotional companion that they used to show on HBO (and doesn't go into nearly enough detail into matters like, how many times the film was resubmitted to the MPAA for rating issues), and most importantly screen test auditions for Neve Campbell and Skeet Ulrich.<br /><br />I hope Cursed doesn't get the royal shaft like Scream did when it comes to DVD. I mean, Cursed was just that, cursed to a disastrous future of mangling to be a box office PG-13 hit and twisting of the original vision of it's creators. What hopes lies in the future for Cursed on DVD? Hopefully, Buena Vista will remember that they do have those disclaimers on DVD packaging: BONUS FEATURES AREN'T RATED(!), and we'll be able to see the copious deleted material for the movie.<br /><br />For Scream? Most likely, not another release. Though it certainly does need it, since it's still without a quality documentary on it's making. And it doesn't make sense, since Sony/Columbia-TriStar has released over a dozen different versions of Men in Black on DVD, and have also updated their release of The Craft and I Know What You Did Last Summer to include new bonus features. What keeps those heads at Dimension standing still?ilmmaker either.

I don't give a flying f*** what it was rated, I loved it! The DVD is incredible. The sound is great (like when Ash is in the cell looking) and it really gets you. The picture is great and its in widescreen. So PEOPLE NEED TO PLEASE STOP B****ING ABOUT THE DVD! IT WAS MEANT TO BE IN WIDESCREEN SO LEAVE IT ALONE!
B000683VI4|5.0|Ryan Gosling and Rachael McAdams star in this beautiful love story about summer romance.  <br /> <br />As an old man reads passages from an old notebook to his wife, he tries to help her remeber the years in which they were younger and more romantic with eachother.  <br /> <br />This movie is a heartbreaking movie to watch, so bring a box of klneex with you, and be ready to ball your eyes out.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Well after years of listening to metal, I have to say this is just a really awesome CD. One of the best thrash CDs ever, I will explain my reasoning though. In thrash most bands had gotten repetitve with their music so you can't listen to it for long (because each song wouldn't be too unique). Then in the other case thrash bands would make their songs too long and stretch them out until you got tired of them. Though with Megadeth they just put out short but sweet,catchy, and head-banging worthy songs on this CD. Hell, Metallica's Master of Puppets was stretched out and boring and Slayer's Reign In Blood (while really good) just got repetitve and wasn't as catchy or unique song to song. I'm sorry but this is a raw thrash masterpiece that is way overlooked in my book and deserves to be compared with anything else the 80's thrash scene had to offer...or 90's.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This movie is truly amazing, stunning, raw, risque, provoctive, and an overall wonderfully entertaining movie to watch.  <br /> <br />This movie analyzes the love lives of four strangers as each of them start to grow closer to each other through each expierence they have. Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts, and Clive Owen star in this dramatic/romantic movie. Jude Law plays, Dan. Clive Owen plays Larry, Julia Roberts plays Anna, and Natalie Portman plays Alice. Dan and Alice start off as a romantic duo, only does to come to an end when Dan finds romance within Anna, a photographer. Alice becomes aware of this, and leaves Dan, only to encounter Larry. However, as time progesses, Anna leaves Dan and by accident meets up with Larry, only to break Dan's heart, causing him to realize his mistake for letting go of Alice. In desperate measures he tracks down Alice in attempt to regain her trust and love, but his luck fails when he realizes he went to far - leaving him alone in the world with no-one to love him. <br /> <br />Overall this movie is a great romantic/dramatic movie that analyzes love, romance, drama, and adultry with incredible accuracy and is an \\"all out\\" movie, that truly makes you feel for each character, no matter how much you might hate what they have done.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I have been able to listen to this whole cd through another website. I had never heard of them before, but as soon as the cd started playing I instantly liked them. They also immediately reminded me of Nickelback (which was ok because I loved Nickelbacks last album, played the heck out of it). I don't listen to a lot of rock music, most of the stuff that is out today sounds too cookie-cutter. But these guys are really good. My favorite songs are Santa Monica and Say Goodbye.
0786714875|5.0|When will we ever get if right.  Hardly a day goes by in America that you don't hear about past atrocities, and yet, these holocausts continue to happen. Why?  Maybe if Five Million died it would have gotten recognition.  Or maybe, if there were valuable resources in the land, they may have gotten some help.  Or maybe, if their location was strategic in the world, or if America was sending endless billions to their country - they may have gotten help. But they were nothing more than God's children - not worthy of help from the all-knowing powerful people of the world. We hear everyday about other peoples atrocities, but theirs hardly gets a footnote.  Money will always come first, morality second...always
B0000027F8|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out.  I still do not ever get sick of hearing it.  Yes, the lyrics are a little depressing, as is the music.  But, if you're in the mood to just listen, and think, this is the cd for you.  George's voice is so effortless, and the music is so mellow and relaxing.  I will never be without this cd.  Very different from his days in WHAM! <br /> <br />I love it!
B000002IG4|4.0|ALthough Phil has this stereotype surrounding him that he just does formulaic pop, I was so pleasantly surprised to put this one on and hear cool prog songs. This album kind of makes up for the 1982 gap in the Genesis catalogue. 'I don't care anymore', 'Like China', 'Do you know, do you care' and 'West side story', which reminds me of 'Brazillian', are all solid, progressive songs. Okay, they're not 'Suppers Ready', but they're as progressive as say the material on 'And then there were three'. Not only that, I love this version of 'You can't hurry love' [a great pop song] and 'I can't believe it's you' is mature and interesting enough to not be dubbed 'formulaic pop' [I actually love that song]. I love side one of the album. Side two isn't as good, IMO. I've never liked 'Doesn't matter to me' and the ominous 'Thru these walls'. But there's a couple of fine ballads and the afforementioned West Side Story and it's solid enough to fill that gap in the Genesis catalogue from '82. I'll also be on the look out for 'Acting very strange' from the same year.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Powerful, sometimes lengthy bursts of emotive guitar, fused with Matthew Bellamy style vocals, amazing incorporation of latin/spanish style rhythm, and beautiful spanish lyrics.   <br />Half the album is in spanish, but the won't stop you from being sucked in and taken captive by this compelling piece of work from The Mars Volta.  The entire thing is absolutely beautiful.  They transition from droning soundscapes, to powerful in your face songs seasoned with the latin sound, and the vocals are mind blowing--and I thought Matthew Bellamy was the only one who could sing like that!
0140277447|5.0|Does it really matter if the number of Chinese civilians that are killed is 50,000 or 500,000? An atrocity is an atrocity, regardless of the number! Many innocent civilians are mass murdered and that is the fact! Smaller number doesn't automatically make the massacre a &quot;small thing&quot;. Smaller number doesn't mean Japanese government is not guilty about the massacre. The smaller number doesn't mean Japanese government don't need to apologize!!! The number of Jews that are killed in the concentration camps also varies, how come I don't see anyone arguing about the numbers? The Japanese government should stop trying to find excuses and face the true history! People's voice cannot be wrong! Where do you think those victims that accuses Japanese government come from? Victims cannot be fabricated. It doesn't really matter if China is under communism or not. Even if China is a democratic country, Chinese people will still remember the atrocities the Japanese had done to them!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Hands down - the funniest movie ever (like anyone could ever know that)! This is one of those movies that gets better each time you watch it! This movie is for someone who has a good sense of humor, and it helps to have grown up in the 80's! It's clean and doesn't have any cussing. In my opinion, it's a winner all around!
B0002858YS|2.0|the killers have a rad sound but this album does not live up to the hype. The songs seem to be teen punk power pop wrapped in a New Order sound. I've heard it many times over. Listen to Joy Division or The Strokes instead. Way better tunes, and original. Hopefully on the next Lp The Killers find their own sound.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Excellent sequel to a great story. There is lots of violence in this movie so be warned. But if you can somehow get over that you will be treated to an excellent movie. David Carridine does a wonderful job here too. And Uma is just a pleasure to watch.
B000062XGD|5.0|With CAST AWAY, I think Tom Hanks reached a pinnacle of perfection in his role as Chuck Noland, the FedEx exec who gets stranded on a remote Pacific island.  Although Hanks had won two Oscars previous to this film, it is this performance that articulates Mr. Hanks' remarkable talents.  The performance is a brave one; Hanks had to undergo a considerable physical transformation and took a whole year to do that.  Working again with his Gump director Robert Zemeckis, Hanks is required to work solo for about an hour of the movie, with very little dialogue.  It allows the viewer to share in the experiences that he does, and it gives new insight to our romantic images of tropical islands and such.  Wilson the Volleyball is a wonderful addition as Tom's only \\"companion\\" on the island and when Wilson is lost at sea, Hanks' remorse is nearly devastating to him and the viewer.  The movie's third section is a little depressing in that Hanks' life has changed so much and his loss once again of Kelly (a sturdy but underused Helen Hunt) is heartbreaking.  The movie has some stunning visual images and the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is great.  Hanks should have won the Oscar for Cast Away, losing it to an over-rated Russell Crowe.  But he sure doesn't have anything to be ashamed about.  He joins Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie) for the Oscar robberies of recent years.
0783219695|5.0|A movie gem by Ron Howard that us teaches the value of perseverance and ingenuity. The Apollo 13 movie makes you feel like you are right in the middle of it desperately trying to bring our astronauts home. I especially enjoyed Ed Harris as mission control chief Gene Kranz. Give yourself a present and watch this movie.
B00005JNTV|3.0|Nudity in the first 10 minutes.  Plenty of killing, blood, torture, and miscellaneous violence.  All the female actors are hot, buff and under 30 (and many naked).  The male actors range from Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Mickey Rourke, & Bruce Willis to youngster in the Charlie Brown sweater, Elijah Wood.   <br /> <br />Definitely one of those movies for the boys that they'll all run out and add to their little DVD collections right alongside  Star Wars, LOTR Trilogy, Constantine, Matrix, The Professional, Ronin, etc. <br /> <br />The \\"Marv\\" character and storyline was the only reason I gave the movie 3 stars.

0765301598|5.0|An excellent addition to the Herbert and Anderson Dune prequels.  The only fault that I felt was the rushed ending ... some how it does not make the final connection to the House Chronicles or the development of the Guild of Navigators.  Overall though, it is an excellent book.
0679731725|5.0|Ishiguro writes in a spare style, while crafting memorable characters.  In this book, the character of the butler Stevens is wonderfully drawn.  Stevens contrasts his current situation, as little more than an accessory to an American master, to his glory years as butler to Lord Darlington in the 1930's.  Stevens narrates about that time and the importance of his position, which, as the reader will see, takes precedence over his own happiness.  Lord Darlington's involvement with the appeasement movement in Britain is described by Stevens without judgement; service to his employer takes priority. <br /> <br />Stevens' relationship with the head housekeeper is a major part of this story, and the way in which he denies his own potential happiness, instead maintaining a stiff formality with this woman throughout.  When Stevens does speak of her, it is so well done by the author; the reflective feelings deep inside are shown, but Stevens' loyalty to his duty makes him blind. <br /> <br />The chapter involving Stevens' father, a retired butler now consigned to light duties, is chilling and tragic.  Again, Stevens has such a tight rein on his emotions that the narrative becomes even more powerful.  Ishiguro lets the reader imagine how Stevens must really feel. <br /> <br />Those who've seen the movie will get even more out of the book, although the film was extremely well done, and Anthony Hopkins just nailed the part.
0316172324|1.0|The title of this book, \\"Blink\\", and the back cover caught my eye.  I read most of this book but I got the feeling that there were too many examples of the same point.  The feeling I got was that the author was trying to make the book thicker with repetious examples.  Maybe Im wrong.  Maybe I just couldn't grasp the importance of the examples.  Any way, I wasn't able to finish.  The point I got was that a snap decision could be a good decision or it could be a wrong decison.
1592400876|4.0|\\"One of the most profound things ever said about punctuation came in an old style guide of the Oxford University Press in New York.  \\"If you take hyphens seriously,\\" it said, \\"you will surely go mad.\\"  And It's true.\\" (p. 168) <br /> <br />\\"It should come as no surprise that writers take punctuation seriously.  I have been told that the dying wordsof one famous 20th-century writer were, \\"I should have use fewer semicolons\\" - and although I have spent months fruitlessly trying to track down the chap responsible, I believe it none the less.  If it turns out that no one actually did say this on their death bed, I shall certainly save it up for my own.\\" (p. 127) <br /> <br />\\"Phrases abound that cry out for hyphens.  Those much-invoked examples of the little used car, the superfluous hair remover, the pickled herring merchant, the slow moving traffic and the two hundred odd members of the Conservative Party would all be lost without it.\\" (p. 169) <br /> <br />Lynne Truss set out to write a punctuation manual that would educate and entertain simultaneously.  The controversy breaking out in these pages concerns whether she succeeds at the second goal, since almost everyone agrees that she triumphs in the first.  Ms. Truss is very proper and British.  The Publisher's Note states that they rejected up front any attempt to Americanize her work; telling Truss not to be British would be like ordering Chris Rock not to be Black.  I find her funny.  If you opine that the English are the most humorous nationality, you'll likely agree.  In any case, I've provided some samples from \\"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves\\" above, so that you can get a taste of Truss humor before you buy. <br /> <br />Underneath her British barbs and eclectic quotes, Truss has a point.  I had a stellar education, or at least I once thought so.  And I thought I knew about punctuation, until roughly one week ago.  It turns out that there are rules for applying the apostrophe whose existence I was previously unawareof.  Our standards have fallen.  Oh, how they have fallen!  And what can we do to raise them back up? <br /> <br />Beneath her points about punctuation, Truss has a deeper point about sloppy writing and sloppy thinking.  In her final chapter, she discusses the future of punctuation, specifically as it involves the new forms of communication available on the internet.  Everyone who discusses the book, including the author herself, employs the term stickler.  To many this holds a negative connotation, since a stickler is one who obsesses over irrelevant details.  But are punctuation, and its relatives such as grammar, spelling, and capitalization, really irrelevant?  A quick glance at message boards frequented by the younger set will assure you it isn't trivial, and that in some areas standards have slipped so low that actually reading what a person wrote is becoming impossible.  The younger generation believes that communicating some of their ideas some of the time is good enough.  Will we stand by and let our literary society crumble, drowned in a tidal wave of preteen net speak?  Will we continue to pretend that sloppiness and laziness in writing are tightly correlated with sloppiness and laziness in other areas of life?  If Lynne Truss has anything to say about it, the answer will be a definite no.
B00005JLZN|4.0|This film reminds me of those mega-platters served at my favorite Mexican restaurant: gargantuan, and cluttered with little embellishments that distract from the main course, but somehow quite satisfying when I'm in the mood. I had barely heard of this film until now, and it took a critical drubbing when it was released in early 2003, probably limiting its exposure. <br /> <br />What we have here is a plot connecting recently-divorced college professor David Gale, (Kevin Spacey), four days before his execution for the death, seven years prior, of Constance, a co-worker at Deathwatch, an organization dedicated to abolishing the death penalty. She is found handcuffed, naked on her kitchen floor, asphyxiated in Romanian 'Securitate' fashion by a plastic bag over her head. She's got Gale's DNA inside her, and he becomes the prime suspect, especially in light of an earlier 'situation' he was set up for. Something's not quite right, and we're called in, along with journalist Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) to figure it out what's going on, ostensibly so that Gale's young son will grow up with the correct impression of what his dad is all about. Now wrap this in a Texas setting, and add plenty of political hot sauce over capital punishment, and you've got a vast jumble of elements that need juggling. In my opinion, it succeeds reasonably well. We see things unfold through Winslet's eyes in a manner reminiscent of Mia Farrow in 'Rosemary's Baby', and the effect is enchanting.  <br /> <br />Director Alan Parker is not the most subtle cinematographer, and this work is no exception: we're bombarded by a vast array of incidental details, lights flashing, drunken excess, and bad limericks. It's easy to see why he was attracted to the detailed, somewhat obsessive script. The saving grace is that the script and director make the details work for the narrative. Characterizations are handled deftly so that going over the plot line from beginning to end - assuming you can accept a coupleof basic premises whose revelation would amount to spoilers here- you can reflect on every character's motivation. Therein lies the film's greatest strength, even as it swims in its political gumbo. <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey gives us one of those smug, holier-than-thou Kaiser Soze-like interpretations here. He annoys me this way, but I'm not going to single out Alan Parker because the esteemed Professor Spacey dishes something he's apparently genetically programmed for - and face it, this script calls for that. For some reason, the entire cast dished out mega-helpings of overacting during the first half hour. As their collective adrenaline waned, things came closer back to earth and settled into something of an inspired groove. <br /> <br />If you're at all intrigued by this, you'll find this DVD excellent value, probably worth a purchase. There is a decent handful of extras: a good 'making of', some interviews, and commentary by Parker. Overall, I think Parker's high point is the 1986 film 'Angel Heart', where the element of fantasy was better suited to his visual montages, but this offering has plenty of personality, even if you have accept the whole 'David Gale' situation like a bunch of in-laws that you love in spite of a few vexing traits.

B00005Y7AW|4.0|honestly, i think this is rufus's best effort.  it's funny, it's morbid, it's deeply emotional and touching.  personally, i wasn't crazy about \\"one man guy\\" (originally by his father) or \\"evil angel\\" (i got this evanescence-esque feeling: not good).  but those lyrics!  that voice!  the arrangements!  wouldn't start out with this one if you're planning to get into rufus, because his other albums won't compare. <br /> <br />my favorite track: \\"in a graveyard\\".  probably the most beautiful song i've ever encountered.
0385513755|1.0|Here's columnist Joseph Sobran's take (The Vatican Cover-up, 17 March 2005) on this great and ridiculous book:<br /><br />+++++++++++++<br /><br />  Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, archbishop of Genoa, has<br /><br />called Dan Brown's bestselling novel THE DA VINCI CODE<br /><br />\\"rotten food\\" and evidence of \\"anti-Catholic\\" attitudes.<br /><br />He laments that even Catholic bookstores are carrying<br /><br />\\"stacks\\" of it. He wants to \\"unmask the lies\\" the book<br /><br />propagates.<br /><br />  Cardinal Bertone's words have gotten a lot of<br /><br />attention because, for one thing, he is regarded as a<br /><br />likely candidate to be the next Pope. He is being accused<br /><br />of trying to \\"censor\\" the book. Apparently arguing with<br /><br />Dan Brown's whoppers -- including slanders of the<br /><br />Catholic Church -- is a form of medieval persecution,<br /><br />proving Brown's point.<br /><br />  Which is? That the Catholic Church is evil. It's<br /><br />based on lies and superstitions, and it has known and<br /><br />covered up the truth for centuries, to this very day,<br /><br />using the most unscrupulous means. Brown's novel begins<br /><br />with a murder in the Louvre (yes, the one in Paris)<br /><br />instigated, the reader soon learns, by a priest of Opus<br /><br />Dei.<br /><br />  The plot is terrific. I spent a weekend unable to<br /><br />put the book down. The hero, an American Harvard<br /><br />professor, is suspected of the murder, so he must solve<br /><br />it while eluding the police. He is aided by a young<br /><br />Frenchwoman (a cryptologist) and a scholarly Englishman,<br /><br />Sir Leigh Teabing. (The real-life model for Teabing is<br /><br />suing Brown for plagiarism, but never mind.)<br /><br />  Brown is nothing if not audacious. Through these<br /><br />scholarly characters, he creates, in addition to a great<br /><br />suspense story, an elaborate fictional history as<br /><br />background, which he wants the reader to believe. This<br /><br />gives new meaning to the term \\"historical fiction.\\"<br /><br />Brown's history, which he boasts is based on thorough<br /><br />research, is about as credible as Robert Blake's alibi.<br /><br />  That \\"history\\" posits that Jesus wasn't divine and<br /><br />never claimed to be. (So why was he accused of blasphemy<br /><br />when he forgave sins? Never mind.) He married and had a<br /><br />child with Mary Magdalene, whom he wanted to lead his<br /><br />church after he was gone. (What did he need to create and<br /><br />leave a church for? Did he know he was going to die<br /><br />young? Never mind.) But misogynist males hated Mrs.<br /><br />Jesus, so she fled to France and had her baby (a girl!),<br /><br />whose secret line eventually became royalty. Meanwhile,<br /><br />the male church denigrated the memory of Mrs. Jesus, nee<br /><br />Magdalene, and denied her original role.<br /><br />  Okay. Follow me so far? Brown's world-famous expert<br /><br />on church history, Sir Leigh, informs us that Jesus was<br /><br />first proclaimed divine by the Emperor Constantine in<br /><br />A.D. 325, which suggests that the world-famous expert is<br /><br />unacquainted with the New Testament, let alone the<br /><br />Patristic writings and early controversies of the church.<br /><br />(Why did the church still exist in 325, if everyone had<br /><br />always assumed that Jesus was only a human? Didn't it<br /><br />worship him? Or was it just a Jesus Memorial Society? Oh,<br /><br />never mind.)<br /><br />  Tiny secret societies kept the truth alive through<br /><br />the ages, so Leonardo da Vinci found out about it and<br /><br />encoded it in his ostensibly Christian paintings, which<br /><br />Brown's hero decodes for the reader. Meanwhile, the<br /><br />Catholic Church continued its misogynistic tradition,<br /><br />oppressing them and blaming them for everything. During<br /><br />the Middle Ages, the reader is informed, the Church<br/><br />burned no fewer than five million women as witches! And<br /><br />not only did it burn much of Europe's female population<br /><br />at the stake (without protest from the men) -- it<br /><br />prevented historians from finding out about it!<br /><br />  Brown's suspense story is grippingly plausible, with<br /><br />some of the most stunning plot twists I've ever read.<br /><br />It's his \\"historical background\\" that's like a goofy<br /><br />dream. You want to argue with it until you pause to<br /><br />reflect that it doesn't make any sense. It's not just<br /><br />untrue; it couldn't possibly be true. It's like a story<br /><br />set in today's New York City in which the hero finds out<br /><br />that the discovery of America was all a huge hoax. If it<br /><br />was perpetrated by the Catholic Church, Brown could do a<br /><br />sequel about this. Brown has proved once more that any<br /><br />smear of the Church, no matter how absurd, will find a<br /><br />willing audience.<br /><br />  For inside the Vatican, it would seem, Church<br /><br />officials know all the secrets Brown has brought to<br /><br />light, from Mrs. Jesus on, and they're still trying to<br /><br />prevent the rest of us from finding out. That would<br /><br />explain why Cardinal Bertone has denounced THE DA VINCI<br /><br />CODE.

B000031XCR|1.0|Celine Dion is perhaps the most overrated female singer in the world! She's ugly, lacks any real talent, and worst of all, sings nothing but love songs! I hate love songs. There are millions & millions of songs out there that are about love, and when I constantly hear songs that are about the same subject every time, it gets annoying. There are better things to sing about besides love. I like Marilyn Manson and David Bowie. They sing about all kinds of cool stuff!
B000069HPL|4.0|LOL!  OK, yeah, this movies a little slow in parts, but that doesn't stop it from being hilrious.  I don't even think you have to work in an office to apperciate it.  I've never worked in an office because I'm only a teenager, but I could relate to alot of experanices even from school.  For instance, \\"We're gonna have to move your desk in the basement\\" comes to mind!  David Herman was hilrious as always.  I think we all know a small, surburban white guy who acts \\"ghetto,\\" and he got the charecter right on.  Although, he doesn't really do it that much in public, it's still funny to hear him randomly say things like \\"Sup G?\\"  And the scene in the feild with the fax machine is a great moment in film history.  I also liked the semi-inapporperate gangster rap in the background.   There was only 1 question that went unanswered at the end.  What IS he going to do with 40 subscritptions to a magazine he doesn't read?  ;)
0060920084|4.0|Bill Bryson is a popular travel writer and humorist who was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, and has lived in England for twenty years.  Upon the death of his father, Bryson became very nostalgic, especailly about the many road-trip vacations his dad would take the family on.  In order to commemorate his dad, recapture some of the happiness of his youth, and reaquaint himself with the land of his birth, Bryson takes two extensive road trips.<br /><br />One is a fall trip into the Deep South, up the Atlantic Coast, through New England, up Michigan, down Wisconsin, and home.  The second is a spring trip through Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, through New Mexico to Las Vegas, to the Pacific Coast, through Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota, and then back to Des Moines.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Bryson attempts to strike a humorous balance between the places themselves, the mind-numbing frustration of long-distance driving, and his own travel anecdotes.  I most enjoyed the parts when Bryson describes the places themselves and the people he encountered.  To Bryson, there must not have been much difference between the various places as he felt compelled to continually comment on the plethora of crappy souvenier merchandise and the fact that he finds most things boring or gaudy.  When he actually enjoys being at a place and takes to the time to give the reader a brief history lesson, describe some of the unique buildings or scenery, or talk about the way of life in this place, I most enjoy the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the book describes funny anectodes from his road trips--getting bored in Carbondale, Illinois; getting drunk in Santa Fe, New Mexico; being refused service at the only diner in a Wyoming town; searching for feminine hygene products in Bryson City; etc--and also describes his thoughts on traveling, searching for local radio stations, and other scenes from the highway.  While Bryson struck a good balance between the three, this reader would have preferred a greater focus to be put on the towns visited--but this is a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />In all, the book was a quick and fun read.  I laughed out loud at times, found myself wanting to take my own road trip, and was generally envious of and entertained by Bryson's trip across America.  I recommend it and look forward to reading his other travel narratives.his reader would have preferred a greater focus to be put on the towns visited--but this is a matter of personal preference. <br /> <br />In all, the book was a quick and fun read.

B000068QY7|4.0|After 1997, Oasis basically dissapeared, unless you were a fan that followed the band, and then out of knowhere in 2002, they launched their comeback album, Heathen Chemistry, and while not being as good or as massive as their first two albums, it does have some classic tunes, and is shows Oasis writing classic rock guitar tunes, which is great. <br /> <br />
B00030EIXW|5.0|I had the luck to see and record this concert being broadcast on PBS many years ago. For years I searched and hoped to find the DVD of this magnificent concert and my wish has finally been fulfilled. Oscar Levant unfairly described Bernstein's  conducting as:\\"He uses music as an accompaniment to his conducting\\".  Similarly while Kleiber's subtly coreographed movements, facial and body gestures keeps the Concergebow players at the edges of their seats, he makes Beethoven's music sound so fresh as if it was written for him to dance to. I have watched many of the greatest conductors on film or live in concert over the last three decades but this one is totally unique for the level of enjoyment, excitement and learning one could draw from watching and hearing it over and over. I wish there were more music videos like this but there aren't many.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|SOME KIND OF MONSTER's main appeal will be mostly to people who've known the band for the last 10 years or so, but it might also be an interesting documentary about how the music industry works. SKOM is a brutally honest portrayal of METALLICA's grueling recording of \\"ST.ANGER\\" and all the hell they went through to achieve this album. Only after seeing this movie will some of us understand WHY \\"ST.ANGER\\" sounded the way it did. It's utterly fascinating, yet baffling to see METALLICA at a creative all time low. These seasoned rock veterans started to write \\"ST.ANGER\\" in the studio, without having any solid song ideas to start with. As a result, the birth of the songs came out of pure chaos, improvisation and uncertainty. This lead up to some very tense creative moments mainly between Lars and James. At times, it seemed that they doing this album out of pure contractual obligation, rather than out of creative fertility. For a band to agree to showcase themselves in this rather \\"demystifying\\" manner is enough for applause and it shows that METALLICA still has the guts, albeit, in a very different way.  <br />The band go through a (as Jason Newsted would comment inthis film)\\"lame\\" therapy period. The band were scared out of their pants to confront themselves with unresolved issues, so they hire Phil Towle, a renowned therapist for rich people. But, as lame as Jason Newsted suggests this is, the therapist actually helps the band to sort their problems out, even if he's \\"kicked out\\" in the end.  <br />For METALLICA fans, this is probably their most personal and intimate documentary ever, to the point of where it could have backfired. Ex-METALLICA fans might want to take a look at what has thier ex-favorite band become: James picking up her daughter at dance school, Lars selling mega-expensive art at a New York auction, Kirk Hammett surfing and admitting that he CAN'T play one of James' guitar riffs!!! We also get to know Bob Rock a lot better. I had the impression that, as a producer, Bob Rock influenced in a wrong way METALLICA's sound on \\"ST.ANGER\\", but after watching SKOM, it's apparent that what you hear on that album is METALLICA's show ALL the way, and Bob just merely contributed to some ideas here and there. <br />Other very revelatory scenes involve managerial decisions, money issues and percentages, something that, as far as I'm concerned, has never been talked about in such a public way. This is classified stuff people, and we're getting the inside scoop! <br />The DVD includes tons of extra scenes, some of them would have been great if included, others are just more informational. The Extra scene that stands out is the infamous \\"Dave Mustaine\\" talk. The scene, to me anyway, was in no way disrepectful to Dave and actually shows him as a very sensitive and hurt man; someone who wasn't given the chance to go the \\"re-hab\\" as James did. It's understandable that such a private moment was captured AND released in a major film, but Dave himself could've asked for the cameras to be turned off in the first place. Dave is, and always will be to me, an integral part of the original METALLICA sound. <br />SOME KIND OF MONSTER ends on a highlight, of course; after choosing Robert Trujillo as, not only their new bass player, but as their new family member as well, METALLICA's future seems brighter than it was back in 2001 when Jason abruptly left. You just CAN'T miss SOME KIND OF MONSTER, METALLICA or non METALLICA fan alike!
B00005JNEW|5.0|Friday Night Lights may be the best book to movie translation that I've ever seen.  This is not an easy task given how many rich themes are explored in the book.  Nonetheless, with the standards set high, this movie manages to capture the essence of the book and Bissinger's riveting window into the world of Texas high school football.  The movie follows Permian high school through their 1988 season as they hope to \\"Win State,\\" but the story is really about:<br /><br />- The religion that is Texas high school football; the worshiping of star players<br /><br />- The relationship between players and their parents/fans hoping to relive their glory days<br /><br />- The sense of hope and identity that high school football gives to people<br /><br />- The lack of hope that most players have once their playing days are over<br /><br />- The lack of education that star football players get<br /><br />- The racial tensions in small town western Texas<br /><br />- The pressure on the players and the coaches to win<br /><br />The brilliance of this movie is that it manages to capture all of this in 118 minutes.
B000002WYT|4.0|This album is great to listen to in the evening, just as the sun is setting while being stoned and in love.
B00079018K|4.0|The first song that you hear is \\"Club Foot\\", their current US single. It's addicting to dance along and sing with all your might as in a live venue performance, but as we go on listening \\"Processed Beats\\" is what it is called- a formulated song with steady beats, the bass is the most noticed, and strikingly \\"processed\\" repetetive rhythm. Sometimes I hear some Nirvana, but just quaint. \\"Reason is Treason\\" gets your attention and once the album is over, you'll remember the verse quite well. As if it were Radiohead or Predo the Lion, but mostly Oasis. If you like some intrumental music it includes \\"I.D.\\" and \\"Ovary Stripe\\", which invokes a spacial far-out sound.<br /><br />This british band is another infamous 80's influenced dark-synth pop/rock. You can compare them to The Faint, who've been in music for a while and getting some air play in Underground stations, as well as some New York bands like Elefant and The Bravery, maybe even Houston's local band The Methods. I hear something different in Kasabian, their sound is the particular perpetual motion that some songs seem to connect with the other like a chapter book.<br /><br />Now that the media is giving some types of rock more air play this band can last a while. Let's wish them the best, shall we.
B000001IPL|5.0|!Heather's teenage son! <br /> <br />Well, seeing as The Offspring are my favorite band and I've only heard parts of this album, I bought it to add to my little Offspring collection.  This can't compare to Ixnay on the Hombre, but it's still REALLY enjoyable.  Dexter's vocals have a higher pitch on Ixnay for some odd reason (probably was recorded differently) but other than that this and Ixnay are similar, Ixnay is more enjoyable.  These are my personal favorite songs on the album: <br /> <br />Come Out And Play <br />Catchy lyrics and interesting guitar notes make this song the best one on the album.  I can listen to it over and over again without getting tired of it. <br /> <br />Bad Habit <br />A song about road rage.  It's got some pretty funny lyrics, and it kind of reminds me of my brother when he's on the road.  For fans of fast-paced punky songs.  Great! <br /> <br />What Happened To You <br />Catchy, short and poppy and it has a similar beat to Don't Pick It Up on Ixnay.  It's a very enjoyable song when you are in a good mood.  I suggest this one highly. <br /> <br />Self Esteem <br />This song is just...wow.  Great lyrics, great guitar...great everything. <br /> <br />So, this is an overall great album and it's very worth the money I paid for it.  GET IT IF YOU ARE AN OFFSPRING FAN!
1593072937|4.0|The world that Frank Miller creates here is truly original.<br /><br />This is a \\"stand-alone\\" story about Marv, about his violent trials and tribulations.  \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" is a very good book, but if ultra-violence isn't your bag, you could skip this one and move on to the other books.  If you can stomach the gore, by all means pick this one up.  The artwork is stunning.  The ending is genius, not your typical Hollywood ending.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"A Dame to Kill For\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" much more than this book.  \\"Dame\\" and \\"Bastard\\" are more involved stories, with more character development.  You care about what happens to the characters.  These books are told in a classic \\"noir\\" style, with Frank Miller's modern twist .  There's nothing else like this series in the world of graphic novels.<br /><br />There are a bunch of Sin City books out there that are collections of short stories.  I prefer the longer stories, so they feel more like a book than a comic.  If you feel the same way, order the titles I mentioned above, and also get \\"The Big Fat Kill.\\"<br /><br />In the movie, Marv is played by Mickey Rourke.  His story is covered in the first third of the film.  Rourke does a great job, but the makeup job makes him look like a villain from Dick Tracy.  Still a great movie.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is a movie you have to watch a couple of times to \\"get\\". I laughed harder the 2nd, 3rd, 4th,time watching than the first.  I totally disagree with the reviewers who said that those who like it do so because they like to look down on others.  I found Napoleon a very endearing character and the relationships developed in the film are moving.  Again and again people say there is no plot.  Do they say that because there were no explosions or sex scenes? The plot was the development of the friendships and there is a satisfying resolution at the end of the film. By the end, Napoleon, Pedro, and Deb find their place in the sun on their own terms.  They didn't have to change to get some respect.  I'm thinking of taking up tetherball.

B0002Z0EYK|2.0|The line between epic spectacle and overblown bore is often as unclear as it is easily crossed. So it's no surprise that Wolfgang Petersen's Troy navigates that demarcation like a drunk driver on a twisty two-lane highway. There are times when Troy is stirring and engaging. However, at least as often, it is flat. There's really too much story to cram into a l65-minute period, yet, paradoxically, the movie seems longer than its bloated running length. And all of the visual majesty that hundreds of millions of dollars can buy cannot obscure the perfunctory and unsatisfying development of the major characters.<br /><br /> Troy is loosely (and I emphasize loosely) based on Homer's epic poem \\"The Illiad,\\" which many educated viewers will have read once (probably in a high school literature class). David Benioff's screenplay keeps most of the places and names, but takes a lot of what could charitably call \\"artistic license.\\" One of the more interesting changes is to place the Olympians in the background. Troy is a story of men alone, not of men and gods. The filmmakers wanted this movie to follow in the footsteps of Braveheart and Gladiator rather than Clash of the Titans. For my money, it's the right decision.<br /><br />Most viewers will recognize at least part of the story, which takes place around the year 1250 B.C. (Homer's poem is believed to have been composed about 400 years later). Helen of Sparta, the daughter of Zeus and a mortal, is said to be the most beautiful woman alive. When Paris of Troy accompanies his older brother, Hector, on a peace mission to Sparta, Paris and Helen fall for each other. The lovers flee to Troy and sanctuary while Helen's scorned husband, Menelaus, encourages his brother, Agamemnon, to rouse all of Greece to go to war with Troy. Led by the hero Achilles, the Greeks attack the walled city.<br /><br /> With the possible exception of Hector, who is portrayed with depth and feeling by Eric Bana, the characters in Troy are paper-thin. The biggest disappointment is Brad Pitt's Achilles, whose miniscule personality is overwhelmed by his bronzed skin and bulging muscles. Despite having bulked up for the part, Pitt defines the term \\"miscast.\\" Achilles is as lifeless a central figure as one is likely to find. Orlando Bloom's Paris and Diane Kruger's Helen fall into the same pretty but personality-free zone. The sparks are left to the veterans - in particular, Peter O'Toole as Troy's King Priam, who employs his limited screen time to fashion a memorable character. In the end, one wishes the film had been focused on the king of Troy rather than the Greek hero.<br /><br />Troy is chock-full of majestic battle scenes, none of which generate a whiff of energy or suspense. Some might argue that it's hard to make a battle exciting when the end is already known (those familiar with mythology know what happens when the Trojan Horse makes its appearance), but I disagree. I had read Tolkien's books long before viewing Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, and was still riveted by the epic battle sequences. Likewise, my recognition of what happened at Gettysburg did not diminish my appreciation of Ronald Maxwell's historically accurate re-telling. What hurts Troy is that there's no imagination or energy to the battles. All we see is the clash between two largely faceless armies hacking at each other. The conflict, like many of the prominent characters, lacks a personality. Petersen's handling of the one-on-one fights (Paris vs. Menelaus, Hector vs. Ajax, Hector vs. Achilles) is more successful.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, there are things to appreciate about Troy, not the least of which is that it's aimed at adults, not children - a rarity amidst summer fare. And, since I'm inordinately fond of historically-based epics (even though little is known about the real Troy), I was entertained more often than not. But it seems to me that if a viewer is going to invest nearly three hours, he or she deserves more than what Troy delivers. The best epics work because they provide both visual spectacle and emotional resonance, and the second part of that equation is where Troy falls short. Tertiary love stories (such as the one between Achilles and a slave girl) and noble speeches aren't enough. Petersen understands the importance of believable characters, but, excepting Hector and Priam, he fails to bring these mythological figures to life on the screen. And that, more than anything else, proves to be this film's undoing.or she deserves more than what Troy delivers.

B00005JNTV|5.0|The movie is far beyond outstanding.  It truly opens your mind to the darkness in the world of Frank Miller.  The visuals are incrediable followed by an amazing cast.  The 3 stories presented definately flow smoothly together, I couldn't even guess the story that Tarintino directed.  The movie runs just over 2 hours and I never once felt the need to catch a glance at my watch.  Robert Rodriguez did an amazing job with bringing this one completely together.  The only downside to the movie was the cleche 50's dialogue.  But it fits the piece well and you become accustom to the language in no time.  This work of art is definately worth seeing.  But be warned!  The violence is intense even in its cinematic glory.  If you were a fan of kill bill volume 1, you'll truly enjoy this movie in its noir setting.  Go see it!
B0006PV5U8|5.0|These performances by Heifetz are amazing. Heifetz owned the Sibelius concerto all his life (and was the first to really standardize it as one of the great concertos beside Beethoven's Mendelssohn's Brahms's and Tchaikovsky's). The disc is worth the price simply for the Sibelius, yet you also get two outstanding performances of the Prokofiev and Glazunov as well. The sonics are spectacular; it sounds as if these masterpieces were recorded yesterday.  Heifetz was the undisputed master of the bow, and this disc proves it; it is a must for all lovers of music.
B000000WFZ|5.0|It is hard to image a more perfect score, and in my opinion, one which surely deserved an Oscar for Maestro Morricone.<br /><br />This is glorious music in full technicolor.  Most imaginative and creative, a perfect complement to the film's subject matter and time period--in fact, it elevates the beauty and importance of the film.  Yet, it more than holds its own apart from the film viewing as a listening experience.  And yes, one theme, Vita Nostra, was even used in a coffee commercial.<br /><br />Majestic and often breathtaking.  Belongs in every serious music collector/enjoyer's collection.

There were detailed descriptions of how the main character a 23 year old owner of the only newspaper in Clanton spent time with a couple of African Americans.While the main story only occupied a very small portion of the book. <br /> <br />However, as usual the Maestro Grisham has always save the twist for the last where he surprised readers towards the end. <br /> <br />Still a very good read but the pace is lacking as compared to previous John Grisham's novels.

078322687X|5.0|Don't let nostalgia fool you.  I was there and the 80s, though they might seem cool from a 2005 perspective, weren't, and they weren't fun either.  This movie is definitely one on the highlights of the decade though.  Funny, insightful, intelligent, poignant, with one liners that never get old.  This movie definitely stands up to repeated viewings.  My only complaint is Ally Sheedy.  Though this is her most remembered role of the 80s, and probably of all time, her acting is less than stellar (though the same can be said of the others, particularly Emilio Estevez).  Don't get me wrong, the others do a great job here.  But, when you think about all the roles of all these actors (the five leads, not Paul Gleason), the sum is meager when you substract this and 'Sixteen Candles'.  This was their collective (and arguably, individual) high point.  For better or for worse, this (and yes, 'Sixteen Candles' for Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall) is what they'll be remembered for--
0151008116|3.0|This book is the product of a 'creative writer' who has taken a few too many creative writing classes. <br /> <br />An interesting assignment for a class would be to have them read Adrift, by Steve Callahan, and then the Life of Pi. Martel mentions Callahan's 76 days at sea in the book so maybe he has read it.  One is reality-based and and the other fiction.  In the end, I'll take the reality-based story.  There were a few too many unlikelihoods in this creatively written story. <br /> <br />Two things I did not like.  I did not like the promise that this story would make one 'believe in God' and then no delivery.  I did not see where the divine interventtion came in. The algae island was a figment of someone's robust imagination.  The Japanese interview revealed a disturbed young man, which I suppose anyone would be after an interminable amount of time floating around in the sea, tiger or not. <br /> <br />The double ending is something of a gimmick that disappoints me.  Not nice to fool Gentle Reader.  Between the lacka delivery on the promise and the double ending, I'm not sure the author got to where he intended to go.  Or maybe he had no idea starting out where he intended to go.  This is, as we gather, pure fiction. <br /> <br />I skimmed over the gory parts and chalked them up to creative license and shock value.  Authors get a kick out of 'pushing the envelope' so they will push.  This is an engaging story although I'm sure many have put it down midway as it can tend to move slowly.   <br /> <br />Recommended is Adrift by Steve Callahan, 1986.  Your local library may still have a copy.
B000001EXR|1.0|This is what Paul Stanley said once when asked about this album.  He said: \\"We looked around us and heard a lot of guitars\\".  These guys were in their 40s trying to sound like a grunge band in their 20s-that's stupid.  Dark and depressing isn't KISS, certainly not at this stage of their career (mid 90s).  They were already super rich, what the hell would they have to be depressed or angry about???  I agree with those reviewers who said this was both an experiment that failed and done for the money.  I love 'Revenge', and I think it rocks and succeeded as a KISS album because they stuck to trademark KISS material and tweaked their sound enough without sounding like they were chasing a trend (plus, they hadn't had a good album in 10 years, so they had a backlog of songs to choose from, some of them written (ironically) with Vinnie Vincent).  Don't waste any money on this piece of sh#@.  Go buy 'SuperUnknown' or 'Dirt' if you want quality Seattle sounds.  Anyway, so I wanted to sell 'The Final Sessions' back, but no one would buy it...

B00005JNTV|5.0|Without being familiar with Frank Miller's graphic novels, I did not know what the essence or analysis of \\"Sin City\\" was, all I knew was it was apparently a film that 'embodied' what some people feel is the real vision of the comic book. Of course, this depends on who you are debating with but to a novice like me, it was an engaging, no holds barred, Maltese Falconesque detective story with great character-driven stories intertwined.   <br /> <br />So many famous faces in this film yet does celebrity ensure quality? Overall, the famous faces in \\"Sin City\\" pay off, for example: Mickey Rourke was brilliant as Marv -- a troubled actor but onscreen, he is at his best. Bruce Willis flexed some acting muscle here and I didnt even think of \\"Die Hard\\" once -- his performance showed that he has matured -- could a comeback be in his path? Some people think the famous faces are distracting but they add a menacing quality film (remember Woods as Frodo? think AGAIN. he was excellent as Kevin and not to mention Benicio del Toro who was so convincing that you might not even recognise him despite that makeup) <br /> <br />Some people may say that this film objectifies women as trophies, raging Amazons etc but I think it links with the themes of corruption, decadence and lost innocence. Jessica Alba has come a long way since 'Dark Angel' - she has a certain luminous quality to her that translates through film. Rosario Dawson is crazy in this film - the contrasting women (the brazen Brittany Murphy, innocent Alba, the silent but deadly Devon Aoki) in this film is what I think adds depth to the female presence.  <br /> <br />Last Thought I: visually stunning, fast-paced adventure yet with thought-provoking symbolism (a corrupt priest allies with a disturbed cannibal of a boy? Miller would make one hell of a sociologist if he pursued this point further).   <br />
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is a fun movie to watch. The action is nicely down and is a true representation of Steven Spielberg's directive abilities, and the plot is intriguing and touching.  <br /> <br />The world of Minority Report is of the year 2054, and it looks just like the world would look like then. There are electronic billboards, advanced retinal scanners to give you personal advertisements and to check for criminals, and autopiloted high-speed cars. Nine years earlier the Department of Justice came together to try and solve the problem of the dangerously-high homicide rate in the District of Columbia. Three years later a highly innovative system called Precrime was developed to test out its capabilities of stopping murder. It used Precogs, who turn out to be children of drug addicts that have brain problems as a result of their parent(s)'s drugs, and their dreams of future murders to stop the bloodshed before it actually happens. The captain of the Precrime division is John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a cop who lost his son to a kidnapping/murder just before the launch of Precrime.  <br /> <br />After six years, Precrime has effectively stopped murder in DC. As the movie opens up we are treated to an example of Anderton racing to stop a man from committing a double homicide on his cheating wife and the other man she's with. He stops the murder just in time. It's a fine example. Unfortunately, a former cop from the Justice Department, Danny Whitworth (Colin Farrel), has come to Precrime with a mission to uncover the flaws of the system. He's testing every possible weak point and instilling a bit of doubt in some of the system's technicians. It seems like he's willing to go to any lengths to find a flaw, even to the point of faking a Precog vision of a murder. Yep, John Anderton comes in to find that someone's premeditating a murder (planning one). Amazed at the person's stupidity, he starts checking things out, only to find that this idiot, this person committing the murder, is in fact himself. Astonished, he races against the clock to discover the truth behind what happened and the truth behind the system. Is someone setting him up? Can he fight successfully against his own destiny? What's really going on behind-the-scenes at Precrime? The plot moves relentlessly and with intelligence and drama. It explores the psychological aspects of humanity, and comes out with a touching, emotional experience to support the main story. One of the three Precogs, Agatha, when visiting Anderton's old house (just his former wife's now), experiences the love in the air for each other and especially for their believed-to-be-dead son. She gets a vision of the son's possible future if he was alive. It's very touching, and the way it ties into the main story is really neat. <br /> <br />The action, while satisfying, is probably not as good as you thought it would be from previews. That's not saying it's bad; as a matter of fact, they're done very well. But instead of action-packed sci-fi thriller the fights and stuff are watered down and used sparingly, with the movie instead relying on a very strong plot to keep it going. The action is built more of suspense than visuals too. Like in the beginning; can Anderton stop the double homicide in time? Can he escape his former teammates? When he is hiding in a factory, will he be found? Very nice. <br /> <br />The special effects are good, and are used mostly for the big-city sequences with the car-packed super-highways of the future. The audio is done nicely, especially the music. It's very orchestra-like, yet fits the action very well. The sounds of the wave-concussor guns the cops were using in the factory have very cool audio sounds, similar to the awesome effects used with the sonic charges in Attack of the Clones.  <br /> <br />The acting in this movie is surprisingly good. Tom Cruise does soem very fine work here, and Colin Farrel rarely gets better. The rest of the cast potrays their characters very well. <br /> <br />Overall, this is probably one of Spielberg's best films and definitely his best sci-fi I think. The best sci-fi movie of 2002. Highly recommended. Although one note: this is not a kid's movie definitely; it's pretty gritty at times and has a mature setting.
B00005JNTV|2.0|Sin City is a interesting failure in that it portrays a stunning grim and grimey metropolis, but populates it with supermen and women who are as out of place there as Clark Kent is in Batman's suit.  Even Hartigan (Bruce Willis), the most vulnerable character whose heart condition that acts up at the most inopportune times, can survive a myriad of bullets and still live to tell the tale.  I even might have looked away from these points if the stories made up for them.  Well, they don't.  There is no mystery in them; they just blame some sort of authority power whether it's government, police, religion, etc, for all the problems the characters are having at the time.   <br /> <br />Okey dokey, how about the characters; they have to be sympathetic and interesting, don't they?   Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan are the best and deserve better stories.  Dwight (Clive Owen) is a typical tough guy character who isn't given as much to chew on as the other two except for perhaps Rosario Dawson's lips.  Why, though, is he given the power to jump pretty high off the side of a building to chase after Jack (Benicio Del Toro)?  Because if he didn't, he wouldn't have missed the key bit of information that Shellie (Brittany Murphy) was going to tell him about Jack.  Did she say \\"stop\\" or something important I needed to know?  Oh well, off to whoretown!   That's just lazy storytelling and gives off the clue that there really isn't a very good story being told in the first place.   <br /> <br />The visuals though are completely brilliant, and it's probably worth the price of admission just to see them.  Even though I've only seen samples of his work online, I can see Miller is a wonderful artist, and his visual work translates wonderfully on the big screen.  There's tribute here to all the great film noirs of the 30's, 40's, and early 50's, and I'm sure Rodriguez and Miller screened several of them to the crew for inspiration.  It's a pity though that this one isn't that good.   <br /> <br />2.5/5
B000001A9P|5.0|1995's \\"Natural Wonder\\" captures the raw energy, unbrideled passion and undeniable excitement it feels to be at a Stevie Wonder concert. This is something few artists can do at their concerts. Stevie Wonder is one of those few. On this two disc collection (culled from his 1995 \\"Conversation Peace\\" tour), wonder performs 24 classic songs with all the skill and soul you'd expect from Stevie.<br /><br />Stevie truly pours his heart into his songs. Just listen to the passion he puts into songs like \\"Love's In Need Of Love Today\\", \\"Stay Gold\\", \\"If It's Magic\\" \\"Ms. And Mr. Little Ones\\" (a new song when it was released and a personal favorite) and \\"Overjoyed\\". And naturally, Stevie isn't afraid to have a little fun, funking it up on \\"Sign Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\\", \\"Sir Duke\\" and \\"I Wish\\", as well as transforming the tender ballad \\"Ribbon In The Sky\\" into an almost nine minute jazzy jam.<br /><br />I was also glad that Stevie decided to revive several lesser knowns gems such as \\"Pastime Paradise\\", \\"Another Star\\", \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" and \\"Rocket Love\\". These songs stand well against concert warhorses such as \\"Higher Ground\\" and \\"Superstition\\".<br /><br />My only gripe is basically the one another reviewer said, and that's that several songs (\\"Master Blaster (Jammin')\\", \\"Living For The City\\", \\"Another Star\\") were a lot shorter than the original versions. Usually when you go to a concert, you expect the songs to be longer than the studio versions. But I won't fault the entire album because of that. Also, I noticed the list of songs that reviewer would have liked seen on this album is the same as mine. But again, I won't fault the entire album for these minor complaints.<br /><br />This is an album that I think everyone should own. Also worth picking up is \\"At The Close Of The Century\\" and all of Stevie's studio albums, which are among the greatest albums of all time.
1592400876|4.0|This is a great read for anyone who has ever wanted to tear down a flier and cover in it proofreading marks. I'd also recommend this to teenagers everywhere- it's a great supplement to your preparations for the SAT writing portion! However, if you've always hated English class, don't waste your time. <br />Mrs. Truss manages to review the history and basic rules of puncutation in a rather entertaining manner. Some parts are a bit dull, but she does pretty well given the material. For all of the nay-sayers, I'd like to point out that probably isn't anyone who could have done as well as (or any better than) Mrs. Truss has with this topic. So BRAVO! for her and sticklers the world over. <br />
076790592X|3.0|All of the lessons presented here  for living a meaningful life have been done before in countless other works. Tuesdays is a loving recounting of the deep relationship formed by Mitch and Morrie as Morrie lay dying. It's a simple story, touching and I think honest. But there's not much new here, and sometimes Morrie seems so wonderful that he ought to be canonized!<br /><br />Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven covers the same ground but in a much more original and imaginative way.
B0000CFW87|2.0|1.) I liked Josh Groban better when... <br /> <br />It was done by Loreena McKennitt or Enya. <br /> <br />2.) I liked \\"You Raise Me Up\\" better when... <br /> <br />It was done by Selah. (It's too soon after Selah made it a hit for a remake to come out. Josh's version is exactly the same except with the third verse cut out.) <br /> <br />The only song I can actually recommend is \\"Remember When It Rained.\\" He has a good voice but the songs are boring and done before. In a few years, he'll be the Michael Bolton or Kenny G of this decade.
0385512058|5.0|I haven't finished the whole book but I have been so impressed thus far that I just had to write this review!  Ferrazzi weaves an excellent read which flows effortlessly.  His perspective of the way &quot;business &quot; happens is quite unique due to his upbringing.  Following his serendipitous journey through life, the true theme of the book rings through in every page; &quot;Don't Keep Score&quot;.  <BR>Do what is right to help your fellow man, be a friend with no strings attached and good things will happen to you.  He prefers to think of business as working connections not networking.  <BR>Some of Ferrazzi's ideas may fly in the face of traditional business but he is quick to point out that traditional business does not exist anymore.  Interdependency is now the buzzword with all employees becoming independent contract workers.  This view is driven home in Tom Peters latest book; &quot;Re-Imagine&quot;.<BR>If you enjoy this book you'll also enjoy, &quot;Love is the Killer App&quot;, by Tim Saunders.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|After hearing this \\"naked\\" version of the album, to be brief I will only say that Spector's work wasn't wrong. This version seemed to me too short and cold. The \\"bonus CD\\" adds nothing. At any rate, I prefer the orginal album.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|This album is a very, very, very, very good one. The opening song 'All Night Long' is more a 80's Scorpions song, but I love it!!! And my version of Tokyo Tapes has ' Polar Nights' as well. I don't know why it is disappeared, maybe it's Roth's voice..... Whatever, I love the live versions, except 'Fly To The Rainbow's live version, it takes to much time. And it's the best idea to put 'In Search Of The Peace Of Mind' on this album, I really like it. Such a shame this isn't recorded in The Netherlands', then it was called 'Amsterdam Album'. 'Hound Dog' and 'Long Tall Sally' are very good, and it's more Rock&Roll (back to the groove). 'Kojo No Tsuki' is nice too. And 'Robot Man' is THE best number of this album. The Others are very nice too.<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!
B0002X314C|5.0|Wow. That is the only word that even comes close to describing the phenomenally talented John Legend. He's old school updated for the 21st century- a throwback to Marvin Gaye, Al Green and all those cats our parents loved back in the day. The CD is really listenable from start to finish. But I do have some favorites: <br />\\"Let's Get Lifted\\"- Mid tempo. Soulful, almost jazzy kind of thing <br />\\"Alright\\"- Very funky sound, kind of a gritty song that makes you think of a smoky nightclub <br />\\"She Don't Have to Know\\"- <br />\\"Number One\\"- A fun and upbeat with a witty rap by Kanye West <br />\\"Ordinary People\\"- Absolutely heartbreaking. You'll be moved by the simplicity of hearing just John and his piano, no production <br />\\"Live It Up\\"- Feel good song with a beautiful violin part by Miri ben Ari
B000002UAU|5.0|this is the beatles at their best. their self titled release [THE WHITE ALBUM] and ABBEY ROAD are great! great! albums [as are most if not all beatles' albums], but this album is amazingly terse - especially when one considers how \\"out there\\" it is in spots.  <br /> <br />it would have been nice for them to find a way to fit 'strawberry fields forever' & 'penny lane' onto the album, but that's as far as i can criticize this album. besides, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is great in its own right - very underrated.  <br /> <br />discussing the songs on the album:  <br /> <br />the two semi-title tracks are brilliant for what they are, and no, brilliant is not an overstatement. \\"help from my friends\\" is my favorite ringo led song. \\"lsd\\" is perfect for a song abot lsd - the imagery is brilliant, and sonically well . . . talk about revolutionary. \\"getting better\\" is one of the beatles' better songs, period. \\"fixing a hole\\" is far too overlooked - \\"i'm taking the time for a number of things that weren't important yesterday\\". \\"she's leaving home\\" is as powerful emotionally as any song on the album save, maybe, \\"when i'm sixty-four\\" & \\"a day in the life\\". paul had an amazing ability to write from the perspective of people older than him. \\"being for the benefit of mr. kite!\\" is john putting a carnival to song - like only he could. \\"within you without you\\" is the lone george song on the album - very eastern. it's a bit similar to \\"love you to\\" [from REVOLVER], but it's far better. \\"when i'm sixty-four\\" is perhaps the sweetest song i've ever heard - it's also one of the most brilliant songs i've ever heard; it's my favorite paul song. \\"lovely rita\\" is hilarious and lovely and the last one hears of paul on this album [paul handled the majority of the songs from 4-10 (every one of those songs but \\"mr. kite\\" & \\"within you without you\\")]. \\"good morning good morning\\" has john coming back in, and he's in fine form - very interesting song structure. \\"a day in the life\\" is my favorite beatles'song . . . it's just one of the greatest songs ever recorded. i'd like to attempt to do it justice, but i don't know how i, or anyone else, could.  <br /> <br />so w/ john handling most of the beginning and end work and paul handling most of the middle work, this album isn't too bad. one of the 5 or so best albums ever recorded at any rate.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|First off, let me just say, I live in Japan and secondly I like animation. Having said that I was horribly disappointed with this dvd.Feeling like I had missed something, I asked a number of Anime loving Japanese \\"do you understand this movie\\"? Guess what answer they gave me! Its not surprising this film didnt do so well in Japan. Yes, Mamoru Oshi has in the past created some master works. Yes, we know he loves his dog (his dog in the movie and ominpresent) and that he desperately wants to let everyone know that by quoting Milton, the Bible and other notable figures in Western Literature in your movie, you can appear to be sophisticated in Western Culture.ENOUGH WITH THE QUOTATIONS!    In the end, when no one from ANY culture can understand your story, its time to rewrite the whole thing.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|totaly worth buying. my sis bought during the summer of 04'  when i saw the first three videos on cartoon network i was like damn! this is good! i am a daft punk fan. the videos were so detailed  and amazing. good plot and very very good music. good for any daft punk and anime fan out there. this is a must buy for anime and music fans every were!
1402545355|5.0|When reviewing an audio book, there are two things to consider. First is the story itself, and second is the quality of the reader.  <br /> <br />This book is engrossing in its detail of life in Africa. I normally avoid mysteries, but I wouldn't classify this book as a \\"mystery\\" per se in the \\"whodunnit\\" tradition. The characters, places, and situations are the real stars, with a view of Africa that is hard to find in the west, when most of what you hear about Africa is about poverty, corruption and AIDS. The author doesn't shy away from the first, and alludes to the second and third, particularly in comparing Botswana (the location of the novel) to its neighbors, who seem to fare far worse.  <br /> <br />To address the second point, normally, audiobooks bore me to tears. I far prefer to plow through on the printed page, but the narrator is SO good! According to the biography, she is from South Africa, and she draws on her knowledge of local accents to give each character a distinctive voice, without making the recording sound like a children's book or a Robin Williams interview. It is just enough to enhance the story rather than distract from it. In addition, knowing the correct pronunciations of all the names is very nice. <br /> <br />I am neither a mystery fan nor an audiobook fan, but this recording captivated me. You won't want to turn it off, and when it ends, you will want to get the next one as soon as you can!
B0001MDQ2G|4.0|I have guilt giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, even though to me at least, it is a solid 4 1/2 star production.   Most of the tracks are excellent, with a couple of exceptions that are weaker.   The concept is great, and as many have discussed it here, I need not. <br /> <br />The thing that hurts it for me is the vocals.   As is often the case with \\"progressive metal\\" bands, the vocals are the hardest thing to get right.   The music on this album is immaculate.  Wish I could say the same for the singing, which makes me cringe from time to time.   Not all of it actually, but the male lead vocals are off key from time to time, and weak other times, to my ear at least.  The female soloists are actually pretty good though. <br /> <br />This is one of the things that ruined Transatlantic's albums in my opinion.  They had great music, but the vocals were so inconsistent, that just when a great passage was coming, off key vocals started and killed it. <br /> <br />But Orphaned Land certainly rocks, for sure.  Their music is tight, original, and melodic.   No noise.   There is some growl here and there, presumably in the right places to tell the story, but outside of Soilwork and After Forever, I can't take much growling.  But thats just me. <br /> <br />I personally love the middle eastern instruments mixed in, especially the acoustic instruments.  Its a rich and full sound, that never gets dull.   And the chorus presentations on some of the songs, like Kiss of Babylon is sweeping and melodic. <br /> <br />I will definitely buy their next album, and will try to see them at ProgPower.  Next time out, maybe a great vocalist will collaborate with them, and they'll hit it out of the park completely for me at least
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Finding Neverland tells a story about how playwright James M. Barrie got his inspiration for writing his most famous play, Peter Pan. But this moving film is not only about that, but also about the ways in which we deal with difficult times in our lives, and sadness, and most of all the power of imagination. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp plays J.M. Barrie, who has reached a point in his life where he is struggling to write in a meaningful way that will connect with audiences. His latest play was a huge bomb, but promoter Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) is willing to sink money into Barrie's productions regardless. Barrie spends his days in the park, where one day he meets the Davies family: mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet), and boys Jack (Joe Prospero), George (Nick Roud), Michael (Luke Spill), and the aloof Peter (Freddie Highmore), in whom James sees a lot of himself. <br /> <br />James takes an instant shine to the boys and their mother, and when he learns that they have recently lost their father, and that Sylvia's health is also deteriorating, he begins spending more time with them. Their time together is spent pretending they are pirates and indians, and director Marc Forster uses an inventive approach here mixing shots of reality and the imaginary world within scenes. <br /> <br />All this time they are spending together, however, creates a rift between James and his wife Mary (Radha Mitchell), who wishes he would spend more time with her, and is suspicious that he is carrying on an affair with Sylvia. Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie) is also jealous of the time James is spending with her grandchildren, and is suspicious of his motives. James contends that he just wants to be their friend, and we sense a mutual need from both the boys and Barrie. All this time, James is putting together his latest play, which is based on his experiences with the boys. <br /> <br />As I said before, Finding Neverland is deeply moving in its depiction of the relationships between James, the boys, and Sylvia, and their respective needs to escape to a place James likes to call Neverland in order to cope with the sadness and emptiness in their lives. The film is not manipulative in evoking emotions from its viewers; it simply allows us to become familiar with these characters, and when sadness strikes, we truly feel for them. <br /> <br />It would be great if none of these people ever had to find Neverland, but sometimes it's necessary to spend some time in a land of make believe in order to cope with the harshness of the real world. Unfortunately for all of us, we can't stay in Neverland too long, because eventually the ticking clock inside the crocodile catches up to us.
B0001IPBUK|5.0|I heard Sick and Tired which is on this CD, I thought she was singing just what I was feeling that day--I had to have this CD! Her music is uplifting,finds your heart and then grabs you from behind and makes you dance! On this CD is Heavy on my Heart and you can feel the emotion she is feeling while singing and agree with every word. I was amazed at her voice, its range and out and out sassiness. She is not your usual pop artist and beats most hands down! I don't think she is well known in the States, I might be wrong on that fact no matter, I had never enjoyed more of what could only be called orginal sound. I'm not up on the latest pop artists but man I can't wait for a new CD to come out! Check out other 2 that I  know of, Freak of Nature and Not that Kind of Girl&lt;--both I recommend as well. Now go more your body to the beat!!
B00005JNDZ|2.0|Unfortunately, Bridget Jones's Edge of Reason is just one more example of a sequel that falls short of the magical perfection of the original film.  Actors Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant, reprise their roles with the usual charm and gusto of the first movie but their efforts can't sustain a weak storyline that has poor Bridget spiraling downwards into a seemingly endless series of mishaps which seem to become increasingly discomforting to watch.  The final (low) blow occurs when Bridget is arrested and detained at the Thai prison among women whom she finds out have been abused, drugged, and pimped by their \\"boyfriends\\".  The \\"humor\\" in this wears even thinner (if that's possible) when Bridget teaches her fellow inmates the proper words for singing Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin\\".  (Perhaps the writers should have been incarcerated instead of poor Bridget.) <br /> <br />The film sequel picks up where Bridget Jones's Diary ends, with Bridget and Mark Darcy well into the start of their relationship, wrapped up in the excitement, joy, and self-absorbed warmth of being a couple.  However, the relationship is tested as Bridget's insecurities coupled with Mark's self-conflict in trying to reconcile loving someone who doesn't quite fit in among his work colleagues and friends, forms the storyline for the movie.  Matters get further complicated with the reappearance of Daniel Cleaver with whom Bridget is paired for a work assignment.  While Edge of Reason has some wonderful moments reminiscent of the first film such as the exchanges (albeit short ones) between Bridget's parents, her friends, and of course the obligatory \\"giant panties\\" and disarmingly funny fight scene between Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver, in total it just isn't enough to match the near perfection of Bridget Jones's Diary.    <br /> <br />It was also a bit surprising to see some character shifts, particularly with Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who in the first film was a seductive yet charming predator who seemed to have some (if little) conscience.  In Edge of Reason, his seductive charm has now taken on a darker quality which makes it clear he is not to be trusted.  Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) exudes moments of warmth (\\"I have a high regard for your wobbly bits\\") mixed with cool aloofness but underneath it all, he does love Bridget and we root for him as he struggles to define the context of that love.  As for Bridget, she continues to battle her own demons, but finally realizes that Mark does love her, \\"just as she is.\\"  (Note:  Bridget's coloring has inexplicably changed from the engaging babyish colors of cream and pink from the first film to a somewhat ruddy tan in the sequel - which seems odd as the sequel is supposed to pickup just a few weeks (or 70+ shags-worth) from the end of the first movie.) <br /> <br />The DVD bonus segments, particularly Bridget's interview of Colin Firth was very funny, and the segment on the \\"Lonely London\\" CGI effects was quite interesting.  However overall it would have been nice to have had more material included on the DVD such as: a featurette on making the movie, trailers, movie premiere and press interviews, out-takes, information about the music selections used for the movie, and perhaps even more deleted scenes (only 3 deleted scenes were included on the DVD).  At  $20.99  this is a pricey DVD (more than The Incredibles, and just a few dollars short of Lord of the Rings and many other better made films) with few additional materials to justify the cost.   <br />
B0007DAZW8|5.0|This is actually my favorite Daft Punk album to date.  I have always been a fan of the type of electronic music that this album provides, and while I still love Discovery for its unique sound, I have to say I favor this one a little bit more.  Yes, call me crazy, call me stupid, but the pure, emotionless, robotic sound ever so similar to their earlier work appeals to me.  Not to dis the great song variety of Discovery (I will always love that album) it's just that I can get that sound from, say, The Prodigy.  The songs are great, almost every one.  \\"Human After All,\\" \\"Robot Rock,\\" \\"The Brainwasher,\\" and \\"Television Rules the Nation\\" are my favorites.  \\"Make Love,\\" despite being the same exact figgin' thing for 4 minutes, had a very '50s feel to it.  Despite the fact I am a young listener, I have a lot of appreciation for classic sound (50s, 60s, etc.) unlike many of my peers.  \\"Emotion\\" is the biggest dissapointment.  It's too slow and trudegs along for six minutes.  Now to address the negatives.  The biggest letdown of the entire album is the length.  10 tracks (one being an interlude) at just over 45 minutes in less than two months?  I seriously hope they buckle down next time and put out a good 14 or more tracks on the album.  Also, I hear a lot of complaints of repetiveness.  News flash:  It's Electronic music.  Repetiveness is standard.  Besides, each song constantly builds on itself.  If a certain part is repeated, it's only 8-16 measures untill something else is introduced. <br />Bottom line:  If you loved Discovery, this might not be your thing.  For the rest of us it's a fantastic album that I've listend to over and over again.  Good job, Daft Punk.  Keep up the good work.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb of God is the best metal band out there right now. Ashes of the Wake is absolutely the best work they have done hands down. I can't even take it out of my cd player it's so good. The guitars, the drums and the vocals are perfect and the writing couldn't be better. I saw them live last weekend with Shadows Fall and Slipknot and they killed. They are the best live band i've seen in a long time. This album is a must for any metal fan, and don't forget to pick up the other albums including the stuff from Burn the Priest.
B000008GHW|5.0|A must have for any Hendrix fan. Don't end up on a desert island without it.
0312954468|4.0|Okay, so the narrator -- Taita -- is a bit too good to be true, but since he was supposedly telling the story, wouldn't it be expected that he would make himself a bit larger than life? That's part of the enjoyment of this book, which never takes itself too seriously but still packs a wallop.<br /><br />All the characters, in fact, are idealized as they would be through the eyes of someone like Taita. But I came to care about them and grieved over them when they died.<br /><br />There is a great deal of humor in the book as well, which is needed to balance out the epic drama and violence. Smith did a masterful job of story telling.<br /><br />I don't know enough of Egyptian history to know if the story is \\"accurate\\" (although who really can tell?. If you're looking for history, try the non-fiction section. But if you're looking for a \\"good read\\" with the feel of historic authenticity, then give this a try.
B000009RC2|5.0|A stunning debut album from these chopmonsters.  John McLaughlin and Billy Cobham run away with the show while Jerry Goodman and Jan Hammer do their best to keep up and Rick Laird keeps everything together with his nimble bass playing.  Perhaps Inner Mounting Flame is not the most balanced album Mahavishnu would do but certainly their most exciting, the beautiful ballad \\"A Lotus On Irish Streams\\" notwithstanding.  An ecstatic, emotionally moving note feast (how do people play that fast?) of an album; quite simply one of the best fusion recordings ever released.  Just for the stunning electric power and ecstatic joy of the the first track alone, \\"Meeting Of The Spirits,\\" this album would warrant 5 stars.  I can't imagine what this sounded like to people back in '71 when it was first released.  There were few precedents, Zappa's Hot Rats comes to mind, but this album just smokes all the competition.  Mind blowing and beautiful.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This cd is classic from track 1 to track 10. Wheels of fire is a <br />definate first single release, classic Priest. Double bass on Demonizer and Hellrider rocks!. Lochness is a masterpiece, sounds similar to old Sabbath.Slow songs Angel and Eulogy are a nice mix. This really is a fine piece of work and Rob still has the screams a must for all Priest die hards. I just can't stop playing it!, If you don't agree, you can head out on the highway!
B00005JGAB|5.0|The 1976 first Ramones album is my favorite punk album, and the Rhino Remasters are great. The album starts with Blitzkrieg Bop, the most exploited song. If this is all you know by the Ramones, you might also like songs such as Loudmouth and Beat on the Brat. The Ramones made songs about things they really felt. They didn't get too trendy or faked anything. Their honesty and humbleness were great additions to the speed and high volume heard in the intense songs. My favorite songs are Havana Affair, which is an honest political satire song, and Chainsaw, an example of their enthusiasm for horror movies. Many fans of punk rock acknowledge the ramones without really getting into their albums. I believe that many people ignore the ramones because they stayed away from following punk scenes and stuck with their simple formula up until the final concert in 1996. I highly recommend the first album from one of the toughest bands, The Ramones.
0062502182|5.0|I recieved this book from a girl I met on a subway in Barcelona and it has changed my life forever! I in turn have giving it to friends family and strangers that were at cross roads in their lives. It gives you a perspective on life that is invaluable.  <br /> <br />Those that have read this book and based their reading on writting a review or finding a spelling mistake have missed the point of the entire book.  <br /> <br />It is more then a story, and if you are open to suggestions and need a little more insight in life, I strongly suggest this book. I am not lying about giving it away either, i have bought it probably 8 times! And the books that I have given away have made their own circulations and hopfully have touched and helped other people discover their Personal Legends!  <br /> <br />Live life to the fullest, it is such a great time!
B00005JNTV|5.0|I had been waiting to see this movie for months now, and I was afraid that it would disappoint me like some other movies that I have really looked forward to lately (namely The Phantom Menace and Matrix: Reloaded).  So myself and three friends went to see it earlier, and when it ended, I thought one thing: WOW!  This was such an amazing movie, with amazing visual effects, a perfect cast, and tons and tons of testosterone-induced action. <br />WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS! <br />Robert Rodriguez co-directs (along with Sin City creator Frank Miller, and with Quentin Tarantino as a \\"Special Guest Director\\") what is, without a doubt, the most faithful comic book adaptation ever.  In fact, Rodriguez sees this film as a translation rather than an adaptation. <br />There really isn't a central plot; rather, the movie is about 3 seperate stories that share certain characters and all take place in Basin City, the most morally bankrupt town ever, which rightfully earns the nickname Sin City.  To call this an all-star cast would be an understatement.  Some of the many actors included in this film are: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benecio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Britanny Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Jamie King, Marley Shelton, and Rosario Dawson (yeah, I know that's a lot), and while some of them have very small roles (Wood and Aoki have no dialogue, although neither of them have a small part), all of them are pitch-perfect in their roles. <br />The movie begins with a short segment entitled \\"The Customer is Always Right\\", with Harnett as The Salesman and Shelton as The Customer.  Up next, is the set-up for \\"That Yellow Bastard\\", a story about Jim Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a bad heart who is trying to bust the son (Stahl) of a powerful Senator (Boothe) who likes to rape little girls.  Next is \\"A Hard Goodbye\\", a tale about a huge brute named Marv (Rourke) who falls hard for a beauty named Goldie (King).  They share a passionate night together, but Marv awakes to find Goldie dead in their bed.  A search for \\"justice\\" ensues, with Marv beating the life out of anyone who has information on the hit.  The story also has Gugino as Lucille, Marv's parole officer, Wood as Kevin, an amazingly gifted killer, Hauer as Cardinal Roarke (the brother of the Senator from \\"Yellow Bastard\\"), and Sin City creator Frank Miller as a priest.  The second story is called \\"The Big Fat Kill\\".  It deals with Dwight (Owen), an ex-photographer (this isn't explained in the film, but there is a graphic novel that sets up the Dwight character prior to the events of this story) and now a sort of mercenary who goes to Olde Towne to help defend Gail (Dawson) and her fellow prostitutes from Jackie Boy (del Toro), a deranged maniac with a penchant for violence against women.  This segment also has Murphy as Dwight's girlfriend Shellie, Bledel and Aoki as fellow hookers Becky and Miho (deadly little Miho), and Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, a hired goon for an unnamed mobster.  Finally, \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" is the last major story.  It picks up after the events of the previous part of the segment.  Hartigan has been sent to prison, because Senator Roarke spun things to make it appear as if he raped little Nancy (played by Alba in her adult incarnation).  Believing Nancy to be caught by Roarke's men, Hartigan gets out and seeks her out to protect her again from people who want revenge upon him for killing (?) Roarke's son. <br />These stories are extremely gritty, violent, and even a little depressing.  (SPOILER)The only one with an ending that could be considered happy is \\"The Big Fat Kill\\".  There are scenes involving shootings, stabbings, decapitation (or almost so), even cannibalism.  One guy even gets his genitals ripped off.  Also, there is a lot of full frontal nudity (although, from what I understand, nowhere near as much as there was in the books).  So if you feel in any way uncomfortable with any of the above-mentioned things, avoid this movie.  If not, then I highly suggest seeing this film. <br />As I said, the choice of actors for this film was perfect.  I can hardly think of anyone else who could fill the roles of any characters in this movie.  Although, I must say that Willis, Wood, Aoki, Dawson, and Rourke were the big standouts in my mind (even though, as I stated earlier, Wood and Aoki have no dialogue).  Speaking of dialogue, under any other circumstances, the dialogue in this film would be terrible.  However, the actors and situations make it awesome.  Even though many lines are extremely cliched, and I hate cliches, the delivery is amazing. <br />The visuals are stunning.  The film is shot almost completely in black and white.  Although, every now and then, there are splashes of color (certain cars, Dwight's shoes, women's eyes and hair, one of the villains).  Also, many of the shots mirror the panels from the comics. <br />With all that going for this movie, it all adds up to a great 2-hour thrill ride.  Once again, if you don't mind excessive violence, I would highly suggest seeing this movie.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The cd in my opinion was amazing...Unlike alot of new bands coming out right now(crossrfade,shinedown,etc) this band has its own feel and originality to every song put out there...original riffs and its own emotion put audioslave amongst the elite...I think it comes with the experience the audioslave roster has with not a single musician being anything less than a veteran to the game...Not to mention i saw them at 'Lollapalooza' 2004 twice and they were one of the best live bands i'd ever witnessed..Not to mention the best rock showing ever assembled(Rooney,Donnas,Jurassic 5,Perfect Circle,Incubus,audioslave and janes addiction) <br /> <br />    The band also does what many fail to do wich is be convincing on both ends of the spectrum of hard and soft...they can make harder more rugged riffs and vocals and make it convincing(Gasoline,Cochise,exploder) then go and make some of the best slower jams(like a stone, getaway car, i am the highway) and be convincing in that aspect also wich is rare in the industry today... <br /> <br />    Some oif my personal Favorites were Getaway Car,What you Are, I Am The Highway and Shadow of the Sun....this album is definately worth the $13.50 so check it out... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007ZFXNW|5.0|A must see.  Should have won every Oscar available.  Beautiful, endearing Stupendous!!!!!!   <br />
B0007OCG4W|1.0|Does Natlaie Portman have to be in everything these days?  And Julia Roberts- I though we were going to get a break from her too...  let alone Jude Law. Hollywood attempts to do something artistic and intelligent in the line of French or independent films and again falls short.  There are some moments of sexual tension and near excitement but unfortunately Natalie Portman does not get naked despite what some of the other reviews say.  Julia Roberts plays the same chick she plays in every other movie except maybe Pretty Woman.  Although this film attempts to be directly sexual it is not that imaginative and never hardly profound. It's ok but don't get too upset if your local video store is out of it- you can wait to see it- trust me.
0440180295|4.0|This was the second novel I've read by Vonnegut. The first was Hocus Pocus. I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as Hocus Pocus, but it was still good. I really enjoy Vonnegut's writing style. He seems to scrap together bits and pieces of a story into a seamless and enjoyable read. <br /> <br />For a novel about war, it was quite comical even though I would still rank it up there with All Quiet on the Western Front and Hiroshima. Vonnegut shows the ugly side of war and how it effects those that survive. If you enjoy war novels, this one is a little off the beaten path but still worth the time.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx both act superbly.  However the movie is simply a series of murders linked together with a very weak and unsatisfying plot .  A waste of time and money.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I dig the blues as I can often relate to the emotion expressed in this particular idiom.  Womyn do me wrong all the time and I am never to blame.  I also like the drinky and think it's pretty cool when a guitar talks (a lot better then some frippy witch yappy yappy yapping).  Clapton can be downright terrific when in a blue mood and this ranks with \\"From the Cradle\\" as his best album outside of \\"Layla\\".  The \\"Sessions for Robert J\\" disc is also very very nice and boy was I relieved when I realized this particular cd was a blues masterpiece and not some silly tribute to onanism.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I knew from the preview that \\"Sin City\\" was worth looking into, as I am a huge fan of noir. Yet, there was something about the preview that suggested that the noirish atmosphere might be gimmickery. Maybe just the preview was noirish. Heck, parts of it suggested that it might be an animated feature. There's nothing wrong with that, I would just feel as though my expectations were messed with. My fears grew larger when the television preview made the \\"Frank Miller\\" at the top more obvious. \\"Who's he?\\" I asked myself. \\"Oh no! could this guy be the director, are they trying to fool us into believing this is a Robert Rodriguez film when he's actually just producing?\\" I'd almost fallen for that publicity trick before, and if that was what \\"they\\" were doing I wasn't going to be happy. If any of you had those doubts as well you can relax. It IS a Rodriguez film along with several \\"guest directors\\" including Quentin Tarantino. I wasn't able to ascertain who did what as the interlocking stories are not clearly deleneated \\"episodes\\". The atmosphere is wonderful, and I am a harsh judge when it comes to neo-noir. It was MUCH more violent than I was initially prepared for but that's my own fault. I QUICKLY got into Rodriguez/Tarantino mode. It just caught me off guard. Go see it NOW. I've never seen anything like it. The use of color is spare, expressive and stylish. I'm glad I went with my gut reaction and gave it the chance I knew it deserved.
B0006J28BO|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's so cute.  I even got my sister to watch it and she hates anime style movies.  I consider it to be more of a Disney movie than an anime though it doesn't have as strong of a story as say Nausicaa, or Princess Monoke, but the director shows promise. <br /> <br />This is the story of Haru, a drama queen who lives with her mother.  It starts with Haru saving a cat from being hit by a truck, the cat turns out to be the cat prince.  His father the King is so grateful that the whole kingdom decides to give Haru gifts, the trouble is that they are gifts that only cats would like (like catnip), then they ask Haru to come to the cat kingdom and marry the prince.  She then seeks help from the Baron and Muta.  It's a great story about believing in yourself. <br /> <br />Anne Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) as Haru.  Cary Elwes (Robin Hood: Men in Tights, The Princess Bride) as the Baron.  Peter Boyle (Everybody Loves Raymond) as Muta.  Tim Curry does a great job as the Cat King. <br /> <br />This is a great movie for older kids, younger kids might be scared because cats talk and because of some violence.  <br /> <br />I really like this movie and I highly recommend it along with the other Studio Ghibli films I am so glad that Disney has finally taken notice and released these films. <br /> <br />Oh BTW, I did watch these dubbed and in Japanese and I didn't notice that any real dialogue had been changed other than a word here and there.
B000001FFR|5.0|Even though \\"Among the Living\\" may be their finest hour, \\"Spreading the Disease\\" comes pretty close to being the best material to come from Anthrax.  Featuring classic tracks \\"A.I.R.\\", \\"Madhouse\\", \\"Armed and Dangerous\\", and \\"Gung Ho\\", this is thrash at it's best with Scott Ian's precision rhythm guitars backing up Dan Spitz' blazing leads: arguably some of the best guitar work to come from the 80's.  The epic \\"Medusa\\" remains one of the band's finest songs with a catchy and epic chorus and a perfect display of Charlie Benante's insane drum work.  Joey Belladonna's voice never sounded better than it did on \\"Spreading the Disease\\", and his voice alone makes \\"Madhouse\\" an amzing track.  All in all, this is an absolute thrash classic, and if you're a fan new to the band, this is a perfect place to start.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I saw this yesterday and I was not disappointed.  I loved every minute; my favorite of the three stories was The Hard Goodbye.  I read the comics and Mickey Rourke did an excellent job as Marv.  It was like I was reading the comics all over again it was amazing the way that they put the books on screen.  The cast in this was amazing Jessica Alba as Nancy, Elijah Wood as the sick and twisted killer Kevin, Bruce Willis as the troubled cop Hartigan, Benicio del Toro, Jamie King as Goldie, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy as Bencio's ex girlfriend, Clive Owen as her new boyfriend, Josh Hartnett as the assassin, Devin Aoki as Miho, Alexis Bledel as Becky (I loved her eyes), Frank Miller did appear in this as a priest, all in all I loved the cast.  Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller did an excellent job I have never seen anything truer to a book before. <br /> <br />This is NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN.  There is some nudity, cannibalism, a lot of violence, and swearing. <br />
1593072937|5.0|In the first few pages of Frank Miller's first Sin City story, The Hard Goodbye, we are introduced to Marv; an ugly, brutish, and somewhat deranged individual.  He meets a girl named Goldie, and after their first, and only, night of passion, she is murdered.  Soon enough, Marv is on the run from corrupt cops out to get him, and punching and kicking his way through a plot involving a high standing political/religious figure while getting closer and closer to the killer.  As if you can't tell by now, The Hard Goodbye is not for the faint of heart, and it's definitely not for every taste.  However, this is Miller at his near best, and this is comic crime-noir at it's best, and it would only be surpassed by the later Sin City story, That Yellow Bastard.  Miller's black and white art is pitch perfect giving it the noir look that Sin City has been reknowned for for years.  Who knows what makes Frank Miller tick that makes him write stories like this, but whatever it is, let's hope it keeps ticking.
B000777J2S|4.0|Antony writes good songs. So the only thing that could distract the listener is either his voice, or the topic that dominates the lyrics and artwork. Many people don't like Antony's voice... and I can understand that. Something about it reminds me a lot of Aaron Neville. It has a simular flute-like quality, although their pitch is different. <br /> <br />The specific thread of thought running through the album is that of gender identity... a boy who wants to be a girl. Antony skillfully paints it though so that it's not the way America would like to view gender identity crisis'. It's not the pervy male drag queen fetish, but an actual knowledge that the body doesn't match the insides. <br /> <br />So while most people may not identify with the specific longings presented, the general theme of longing for change is something everybody goes through. This longing adds a sorrow weight to the music, exempified by Antony's voice... which warbles, but not in an out of control way.  <br /> <br />While it is unclear to me how far the gender identity issues run with him... does he really want to be a woman? far enough to take the hormones and become transsexual? or does he not care about that as long as he can dress in drag? Or is the whole thing a farce... a gimmick to stand out from the crowd? If the latter, then I'd have to rate this album with two stars. The whole appeal of \\"I Am A Bird Now\\" is the emotional pull... finding out it's a gimmick would cut that off completely.
0393035158|4.0|I became interested in this book after listening to the author speak on BookTV, finding in his remarks and demeanor an important antidote to the jingoistic proselytizing that apparently passes for religious thought in America these days.  Harris is a natural writer and an important thinker, there's no mistaking that.  There is no fumbling in the pages of this book, no cheap shots, a mesmerizing intellectual sincerity and a passel of original ideas the author fuses into an engaging whole in clean, clear prose.  His thoroughgoing dissection of the violent fundament inherent in the creeds of Islam and Christianity, in particular, never wavers from his central theme - these religions' requirement of belief based on insufficient evidence.  So far, so good, I would say, though it is interesting that Harris' forte being philosophy, not science strictly speaking, would seem to indicate a possibility that the idea of 'evidence' might be made more pliant and less exclusive than the author allows in this book.   <br /> <br />Harris' arguments from a socio-political perspective are well reasoned and welcomed. No right thinking person wants a Tom Delay account of things passing for either religion or politics.  An unfortunate aspect of Harris' assertions is an unrelenting insistence on defining faith strictly as faith IN - creed, gospel, scripture, tradition - and ignoring the more fluid and indeed more exacting meaning of faith; its accepted meaning, yes, but also what it might be, what it can be.  This seems to me a more important idea to examine, in contradistinction to merely assuming a kind of atheism - an idea with no escape since it instantly takes up arms against the very thing it claims not to exist.  The book's title and subtitle would still serve well even if one were to find a larger canvas inside its pages.   <br /> <br />My other criticism of the book is its inescapable negligence in providing a comparable dissection of Zionism.  Harris himself makes the apt pointthat most if not all of the isms in the world are but religion substitutes - communism, consumerism, environmentalism, etc.  Zionism, with its history of racism and violence, does not occasion an extensive inclusion in his cogent analyses of the need for an end of faith?  Despite a few sprinkled sentences devoted to castigating the God of Israel in relation to his main theses, I ended the book feeling as if a chapter had been overtly left out.   <br /> <br />These criticisms notwithstanding, I recommend the book without hesitation.  Sam Harris has opened important new ways of looking at the interaction of religion and societies.  One must be grateful for this, especially in a society virtually uprooted at present by nefarious politics of intimidation and by an ever-morphing array of cultic religious sects the standards of which make mediaeval machinations seem mere closeted fantasies, not to mention the flagrant fusing of the two at the highest reaches of civil government - a state we are precariously living through even as I write this.
B00000613T|3.0|I once heard a lot of Mahler at the CSO conducted by Solti, Giulini, Tennstedt and others. While Boulez is a fine technician he lacks the \\"soul\\" in Mahler. The music is clean and well played. The CSO could hardly play it poorly. But the music lacks the depth that is written into the notes. I feel that Chailly, Giulini and the 1938 Walter recordings come closer to realizing how Mahler meant this music to be played. There is, of corse, the three Bernstein readings. I grew up with the NYP recording. I have to dismiss the DG recording...too indulgent. Yet, the Berlin recording he did is quite good. If you can tolerate the poor sound the old Walter reading is my first choice followed by Chailly's wonderful new recording.
0723284075|5.0|These stories are beautifully illustrated and do not 'talk down' to their listeners.  They truly are tales and are just about the right length for sleepytime.  We have received other anthology-type gifts and the books are always very cumbersome.  These are the perfect size for reading at bedtime with your little ones because they fit in your hands and don't weigh ten pounds.  (to disagree with a couple of the reviewers) <br /> <br />  Our daughter is receiving this for her third birthday, even though we have a couple of the stories already.  She has enjoyed Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock (the scary ones) and Jemima Puddle Duck since she was one and I believe that the stories will continue to grow with her.  And someday, hopefully, she will have these books to hand down to her children!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I love this CD. The songs are great and none of them sound the same like other emo/punk/ bands do, The songs on the Cd are just great. <br />Smart good songs that everyone can enjoy, I'm a teen and when I let my dad hear this CD (He likes AC/DC, Zeppelin, Black Sabbath) <br />He said surpirsingly he liked it, he told me all the songs were good and that they kind of sound like the 80's band Lover boy! <br />I dont know about that but I know one thing It's a great CD but it!
0312954468|1.0|This was the first book I attempted to read by Wilbur Smith, I heard he wrote great exciting historical novels. Since I had just finished Gates of Fire by Pressfield and Shooting the Sun by Max Byrd, (both historical fiction novels that I recommend) I thought I would see why Mr Smith deserved such acclaim. But River God is absurd. The hero is a eunuch slave who apparently is smarter than anyone who ever existed. In the first chapter, he describes his invention of the composite bow, and then of battering rams for galleys. In subsequent chapters, he demonstrates skills as surgeon (autopsies and brain surgery 2000 years before Christ!), artist, metallurgist, architect, theater director, and on and on and on. It would be impossible for one person to accomplish so much, it is too implausible. Also, at one point, our heroes confer in a field of corn(!), though corn is a New World crop, and next page the Egyptian soldier assemble into a phalanx, even though Greece hasn't been founded yet. The good guys are perfect, beautiful and sickeningly good, and the bad guys are vile, corrupt - it all completely predictable. Maybe if you are 13 years old, this level of subtlety is appropriate, but for any adult, River God is absurd. Quite a disappointment.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Glengarry Glen Ross is a movie that pretty much case studies the effects of extreme pressure put upon workers to perform. In this particular case, it's real estate salesmen however the results certainly could've been similar for workers in a restaurant, a hospital, etc... The pressure placed upon them to close sales leads by a 'motivator' from the head office is extreme and could be considered cruel. The leads in their possession are old. New leads will be given only to those who close the old leads (and if they don't close, they get fired). Their reactions range from anger on through to the resolution to act immediately. One of the salesmen cracks and decides to steal the new leads. Who stole the leads and did he do it by himself or did he have inside help?     Glengarry Glen Ross pretty much occurs throughout one 24 hour period. As a result, the pace is deliberate but it serves the story well. The dialog is scintillating (and not just because of the foul language). All actors involved (even those given small parts) give the performances of their lives. All these elements combine to make Glengarry Glen Ross a movie for which there's no equal.    For those who want to discuss the movie further, visit groups.yahoo.com/group/glengarry_glenross.

0312995423|3.0|Susan Fletcher is the head cryptographer of an ultrasecret and very powerful American government organisation, the National Security Agency, that screens all the e-mail that is being sent all over the world. For this they have a very powerful decryption machine, TRANSLTR. But one Saturday Susan is called by her boss that TRANSLTR has hit an undecypherable code. And then her life becomes a nightmare, because she does not know who to believe or to trust. When she finds out that the love of her life, a language professor, is also involved and that an assassin is trying to kill him in Spain her life becomes a positive nightmare. Luckily all is well that ends well. <br /> <br />This was Dan Brown's first book and the last one that I am reading: this is not the proper order as an author will develop his style and become better over time and this is probably the reason why I find this book less exciting than the previous ones. It is rather disappointing that I can solve a riddle on page 79 that takes the two main cryptographers of NSA 300 additional pages to solve and the same happens again at the end of the book.

6305212112|5.0|\\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" has been my favorite movie ever since it came out over thirteen years ago.  I was a child at the time, and fell in love with the film.  It is such an enjoyable film that it is more than likely to watch it over and over and never get sick of it, as I have.  The film was a much-needed change from the normal romantic comedies, dramas and action films of the late '80s and early '90s.  It bridges the gap between many borders, including age, race, sex, and even sexual orientation, a fact more so apparent in the book than in the movie, but even still visible.  Many people may remember the writer of the book \\"Fried Green Tomatoes At the Whistle Stop Cafe\\" from such shows as \\"Harper Valley, P.T.A.\\" and \\"Match Game.\\"  She is none other than the irresistably funny, and unjustifiably southern, Fannie Flagg (she even has a cameo role as a relationship expert trying to help the main character, Evelyn put that \\"spark\\" back into her marriage).  The filmization is one such example of Hollywood bringing more justice to the book than the book brings to itself (this is highly subjective, of course).<br /><br />Let's take a tour of the movie.  Lonely, overweight housewife, Evelyn Couch (pleasantly played by Oscar-winner Kathy Bates) arrives at a nursing home with her sports-loving and equally overweight husband Ed Couch (played by veteran TV comic Gailard Sartain), where he is going to see his aunt Vesta.  This is where Evelyn runs into a spritely octogenarian named Ninny Threadgoode (played beautifully as always by Oscar-winning actress Jessica Tandy), who opens up a can of worms by asking Mrs. Couch, \\"Does the name Idgie Threadgoode ring a bell?\\"  From there, Ninny proceeds to relate a sweeping tale centering around two friends in the 1920s and 1930s.  Supposedly, she had been the widow of one of the character's brothers.  The story is about the tomboy Imogene Louise Threadgoode, nicknamed \\"Idgie\\" (played by a young Mary Stuart Masterson, giving, to me the best performance in the film), and her friend and former love interest of her elder brother, Ruth Jamison (played equally well by Mary-Louise Parker).  Every holiday, Evelyn Couch would reappear in the nursing home to hear more about Idgie and Ruth's life sixty years earlier, while her life is transformed as a result.  She had been taking a marriage counseling class, but had abandoned that due mainly to Ninny's tales.  Soon, she finds herself visiting Mrs. Threadgoode (who, by the way is only there to look after the Threadgoode's old maid's baby sister, but is going home as soon as she gets better), more and more just to hear about the trials and tribulations of the south of the 1930s.  Ninny tells her everything beginning in 1920, and ending in 1939.  It includes death, love, marriage, death, birth, entrepreneurship, death, scandal, a courtroom battle, and death, all in that order!  In the end, Evelyn has learned many things thanks to Mrs. Threadgoode, and wishes to care for her in her final years.  The movie ends with the viewer wondering one thing only.  If you watch it you will see what I am talking about!<br /><br />The cast of the film is wonderful.  As I've said previously, you will see Kathy Bates as Evelyn Couch, Jessica Tandy as Ninny Threadgoode, Mary Stuart Masterson as Idgie Threadgoode, Mary-Louise Parker as Ruth Jamison (later Bennett), and Gailard Sartain as Ed Couch.  Other members of the cast were equally as good as the prime actors:  Chris O'Donnell as Buddy Threadgoode, and Lois Smith as the matriarch of the Treadgoode household, Stan Shaw as Big George, Gary Basaraba as the town sheriff, Grady Kilgour, and Grace Zabriskie as the saloon proprietor.  Perhaps the most underrated performance of the movie would have to go to the one given by the immensely talented Cicely Tyson, playing Sipsey, the Threadgoode's lifelong maid.  Her actions, are both humorous as well as emotionally charged.<br /><br />All in all, this film is a classic and is just beautifulin every sense of the word.  If you are still curious, just rent it and see for yourself, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.  And, what I said in the beginning is true, \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" really is my VERY VERY favorite film of all-time.  There is not one single film better to me.  Enjoy!se of the word.  If you are still curious, just rent it and see for yourself, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

B0006399FS|1.0|U2 are agonizing, in coma, and don't even show any sign of wanting to be back to life. In these moments they are performing a serie pathetic nostalgia concerts in the United States for their crappy Vertigo Tour, which has been the poorest and weakest Tour of all their career. It don't even should be called Vertigo Tour, because it's the Elevation Revisited Tour. Setlist is almost the same, stage is almost the same, the band looks exactly the same, etc. EVERY SINGLE S*** HAS BEEN THE SAME SINCE 2000.   <br /> <br />It's the same stuff as the last album ATYCLB. It seems that 5 stars snobs don't remember why U2 was the greatest band in the 80's and 90's... because they were the only one band  could be reinvent completely their musical direction with every new album.   <br /> <br />It's apparent those days are gone. Now U2 are no more than another nostalgia act. It's over, let's face it. Their last glimpse of creativity was at an end with the overrated ATYCLB.  <br /> <br />With this sellout comeback ( with a lame album that just after few months of being released sounds more obsolete, old, outdated, tiring, monotonous, boring, unoriginal, weak and repetitive that any another U2 album of the 80's and the 90's ) U2 have shown that a band just need to make a good musical legacy in the past to continue selling albums in the present, nevermind how pointless they are. <br /> <br />All the songs sound like ATYCLB, Bono is such a pity as a singer, with his annoying raspy dimished range, and the rest of the band is completely numb, only limited to repeat what they have played for decades. Songs are horrid, songwriting has no direction or concept. U2 yet want to make another 2 albums and another \\"Best Of\\" just because of their unlimited greed in the music industry with record labels trying to sell \\"U2\\" name alone, but their sellout ATYCLB style lacks the originality, commitment, uprightness, sincerity and excitement they had in the 80's and 90's. <br /> <br />U2 are dead.
068987474X|3.0|I'm not a female in denial. I would probably recommend that 1) borrow the book from a friend. 2) a lot of generalizations. I know that men and women are different but not all men are the way the book is describes and not all women are that naive. So when you read the book, be open minded that some of the things can be factual as to the reasonings.<br /><br />That being said I did take away a few pointers...if anything just the mental thought of keep telling yourself that \\"he's just not that into you\\" to be able to move on. Afterall, how long should you waste your time on someone who is not giving you what you want?
0441003257|4.0|I read all of the original ten Sandman volumes. Also \\"Angels and Visitation\\", and \\"American Gods.\\" The quality of the writing in this book is as good as the ones I mentioned. But it scores much better on the sense of humour side. <br /> <br />I will not write much about the plot as others have. But I have to mention that the only reason I rated this book with 4 stars, is that there is chapter or two where one gets lost. If you have patience enough to bear with the story, then the rest is a fun ride.
0920668364|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. The message that a parent will love their child no matter how frustrated they get was so touching, yet completely derailed by the mother's later unhealthy, obsessive exhibits of her love. Sneaking across town and into your grown child's house is not a healthy way to show love. Metaphor or not the author could have shown the steadfastness of parental love throughout time in a much better way. I'd recommend Lisa McCourt's \\"The Most Thankful Thing\\" instead of this book.
B000062YAY|4.0|Slayer..Live..Two Disc Album..Playing 21 Classic songs..What more could you want? <br /> <br />If you are a die-hard fan of Slayer, and do not have this in your collection.. You must own this as soon as possible. This was recorded in 1990/1991, in 3 different places. Disc One is recorded Live at the Lakeland Coliseum, Lakeland, Florida in 1991. Disc Two (Not as great as Disc One in my opinion..) was recorded Live at Wembley Arena, London, England in 1990..and at Orange Pavilion, San Bernardino, California in 1991. <br /> <br />Disc One, to me, is totally flawless. It also has the most famous songs by Slayer, such as \\"Hell Awaits\\", \\"War Ensemble\\", \\"South of Heaven\\", \\"Raining Blood\\", \\"Dead Skin Mask\\", \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", \\"Mandatory Suicide\\" and \\"Angel of Death\\". Some people write some of the songs off as being pretty average, but i believe thats only because it's Live really. Songs don't sound AS good Live, as they do on studio Albums obviously. But in my opinion, Slayer Live..just on CD alone..is a memorable experience. Disc One is just amazing, worth the money on it's own and can be listened to over and over and you always enjoy it. <br /> <br />Disc Two is not as good as Disc One, but still a worthy inclusion on this Double Live Album. It has great songs such as \\"Hallowed Point\\", \\"Blood Red\\", \\"Die by the Sword\\", \\"Postmortem\\", \\"Expendable Youth\\" and \\"Chemical Warfare\\", but most of the songs just don't have the same power as the songs on Disc One definitely do. Disc One goes for around 50 minutes, whereas Disc Two goes for around 38 minutes too. <br /> <br />Another thing is that, songs \\"Hallowed Point\\", \\"Blood Red\\" and \\"Postmortem\\" were recorded at Wembley Arena in London, England. And every other song is recorded in San Bernardino, California. Although they do melt into eachother well, and you can hardly notice..I just think it would have been better in some ways to have it as one whole concert like Disc One. \\"Blood Red\\" leads into \\"Die by the Sword\\" perfectly..and Slayer was obviously going to play \\"Die by the Sword\\" after \\"Blood Red\\" in England, so why not just have the whole concert in England? Have it so Disc One was recorded in Florida, and Disc Two recorded in England. It might sound stupid complaining about that, but i just think it would have been easier.. <br /> <br />Other than that.. Disc Two has obviously the faster songs on it which makes it even harder to listen to Live, as it's always hard to play fast Live and make it sound as clear as they do on their studio Albums. But overall they do a pretty good job. It's Slayer, and they are the best at what they do.  <br /> <br />So really, going back to what i said at the start of this review, if you are a die-hard fan you must own this. ..And if you are new, i'd save your money for a while until you hear some of their other Albums. That way it'd be easier to accept some of the mistakes they make playing Live i guess, while knowing what they sound like on their studio releases.  <br /> <br />Overall, i give this Double Live Album 4/5. Mainly because of Disc One being so outstanding and awesome, while Disc Two is pretty average. If they left it as just Disc One, without Disc Two, i would easily give this 5/5. ..Also try their DvD's, \\"War at the Warfield\\" and \\"Still Reigning\\". They are both excellent.
B000002MFQ|5.0|This is no plain old follow up to a big hit as was TB I. It is a work on its own to be enjoyed over and over. Its one for the stranded island collection for sure. If you like Oldfield's music you will not fail to like, love TB II.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I seriousely think that this is the most hilarious film of the year. One good thing about this movie, is that you do not have to watch the real \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" in order to actually enjoy the spoof, \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\"  <br /> <br />Storyline- The storyline of Shaun of the Dead is basically about a guy named Shaun and his friend who are practically fed up with life. He cant really be bothered to do anything along with his friend Ed. The only real fun they can entertain themselves with is either by playing video games or annoying the living daylights out of their roomate Pete.  <br /> <br />When they find out that they're are zombies on the loose and everytime someone is bit by a zombie, h@ll breaks out for them. They cant think of a plan to get out of the situation and they end up like wild chickens with their heads popped off, mentally not literally. It is up to them to stop the Zombies and get out of town, fast.  <br /> <br />What i liked about the storyline is that it is so simple and yet hilarious. Director Edgar Wright does a wonderful job of sticking to the story as well as every so often resorting to the real version \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\"  <br /> <br />Great job guys in terms of storyline!  <br /> <br />Acting/script- The acting/script, i thought, was actually better then the real storyline. The words and phrases that each character comes out with are just priceless and another good thing about the characters is that each one has the same personality. This usually isn't good for movie, but when your talking about a spoof like this, its hilarious and great. The actors do a really great job on letting the world know that they are living a dull life and are just fed up with it. I really don't think that they could have chosen better actors to be honest for the role of Shaun, Ed and Pete once again because of their great emotions and acting skills! (Well at least in this movie their acting skills are great, i have to admit, i had never even heard of any of thembefore this movie came out:)  <br /> <br />Once again, great job!  <br /> <br />Other/conclusion- There really isn't that much more to the movie besides the hilarious lines, acting and the storyline. There isn't much action, nore special effects and it isn't really suspensful. I know your probobly thinking, then why go see it? But its the comedy that make this movie great and definetely worth seeing. If your one of those people who don't like characters cursing their heads off (which is one of the reasons why this movie is rated \\"R\\" besides SOME gruesome scenes), then you might want to stay away from it and not watch it, but now a days no one cares HOW much characters swear/curse in movies which is why i think the director added quite a few of those words in the movie, to show emotion and knowing that the audience won't really care.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, if your up for a great killer comedy, this is definetely worth renting or even buying from your local movie retailer!  <br />
B00000342V|5.0|Everyone knows the shaft theme, and no disrespect to Hayes, but it don't have a thing on Superfly. The title track is fantastic, no one can deny the power of Pusherman.  Freddies Dead, No thing on me. I can't pick out a favorite there all so good. If you want some classic 70s R&B/soul then check this. Fantastic. Best soundtrack of the 70s and arguably ever. Only others that come close as far as I can tell are the Soundtracks to The Harder they Come and the Rockers Soundtrack, both of those also being from the 70s and featuring some killer Reggae.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Closer is a very emotional film that will move your heart.  I really like how the story folds and how the 4 main characters are linked together.  And the 4 starts all have amazing performances in the film.  It is definately worth watching if you have missed it in the theaters.   <br /> <br />Then why only 3 stars and not 5? <br /> <br />That is because upon reviewing the specs on this DVD release, I am a bit disappointed.  Got to say I am a little spoiled by the standards nowadays, that I am expecting some extra behind the scenes stuff, or cast and crew interviews.  But this disc provides literally nothing.  No bonus features at all!  Therefore, if you are looking for a good drama, Close is the one movie you should watch.  However, is this DVD worth the bucks?  That will depend on what you are expecting on a DVD nowadays.  To me, I am going to wait and see if they would come up with another edition before purchasing.
B00000373U|5.0|This is my favorite as it was my first exposure to Elliott. Notice I did not say it was his best, lord, I don't really think I could name a best album. I love all his LPs and all the heatmiser stuff as well. I Started listening to Elliott before XO came out and since first listen have been devoted since. I'm not going to say this is his best, just that there is something about this LP that tugs at me more than his other stuff. Maybe it's the fact that the title is the same as a Kierkegarrde piece, Ida know. I do think its better to start with either this or Roman Candle or his S/t lp over XO, figure8 or Basement as your first exposure. Build up the latter day lushness. So many great songs here with a beautiful minimalism, Strong beginning with a strong ending.  A few great slow numbers like Between the Bars and 2:45am, a few almost out of place uptempos like Pictures of Me, and Cupid's Trick(But OH do I love both so much, especially Pictures). I've always loved Music, but Elliott was probably one of the first artists whose songs spoke to me fairly directly. His death really shook me up, more so than any other musician I can recall, I was too young to comprehend who Lennon was when he passed, and when Cobain passed, well at that time let's just say I was in rejection of the Majors(allthough now I recognize his talent). Don't get me wrong I'm not necessarily comparing, just stating. Sad songs buck me up, as kind of sick as that sounds. Check out Either/or, it's a beautiful testament rom a beautifull writer.

B0000C8AVX|5.0|Seriously, it'll only give it back in exchange for more Dylan. The scary thing is my turntable is the same way, it wont let me take Blood on the Tracks off the spindle,unless also in exchange for Desire.  Anyway, great early to mid era transitionary record. Half acoustic, half..blahblah you've heard that part before, all of it's great. I'll admit, I used to despise Subterranean Homesick Blues, but it took this album as a whole to convert me. For me, it's really the middle to the end where this album really begins to shine. Outlaw Blues, On the road Again and Bob Dylans 115th dream is my takeoff point, culminating with It's allright Ma(I'm only bleeding), and one of my favorites, It's all Over now, Baby Blue.  I'd always heard people talk about this album, but it really wasn't until I saw the documentary 'Don't Look Back' that I really wanted to listen to this. By the way, this rerelease also happens to contain my favorite image of Bob, Its right behind the CD underneath the clear plastic that Houses the disc. It's the pic of him in his Shades, Harmonica in his hands w/ the electric guitar strapped on, whether you are a Die Hard folkie or not, I don't care, that pic screams out rock.

Cartoonish, but filled with dread.  <br /> <br />An excellent character study as well as restraint on profanity and racist slurs which made this film much more entertaining. <br /> <br />The actors completely dissappeared into their characters except for Bruce Willis who has more of a type casting.  <br /> <br />Mickey Rourke should get an Oscar nod for Marv. What an ape! <br /> <br />I will own this movie!!
B00008438V|4.0|2 guys named Gary and Wyatt aren't popular with chicks. They can only have dreams.....but do they really need dreams? They got a computer to create a woman. Her name is Lisa and she is the whole world to these guys. They believe it will solve all their problems, too....they will only find out.
B000001FS3|5.0|If you don't get it, don't bother.  Seriously, either you listen to this album and just recognize how great it is and fall in love with it, or it doesn't do anything for you and you're bored.  And weird.<br /><br />I too have listened to this album a bazillion times, expecting to get sick of it but never have.  Also have listened to it after a year or two of not hearing it, and it still sounds completely fresh, relevant, and interesting.  I feel a special bond with this album and the cheesy photos inside.  It has come to symbolize U2 and a whole lot of other things: the mid/late 80s, anthemic rock music, and rockstars who are respectable humans.  Sure, you're sick of hearing the first three tracks on the radio (honestly, it's like being surprised by 'Thriller' at the wrong moment--you love it but you don't want it forced on you by some lame disc jockey).<br /><br />I might proclaim this the ultimate road trip album, particularly if you're stuck on 70 or 80 west but haven't gotten through the midwest yet.  You're about to slip into a coma somewhere in Nebraska (or is it Kansas) and they're right there with you, getting you pumped up about Utah/Arizona/Nevada/Calif deserts.<br /><br />Yes, I realize that none of the songs are about those states!  As I said, you either get it or you don't.<br /><br />I actually try to avoid this album nowadays because I was listening to it throughout my adolescence and now it's a potent nostalgia-bomb.  Best experienced in the company of like-minded friends who won't freak out if I burst into tears for no apparent reason.
B0000639FE|5.0|Jerry McGuire is one of the few films that I'd give my five star rating, with great performances, and a well- written and intelligent thought provoking script I find myself stunned that this movie didn't win best picture or best actor at the Oscars.<br /><br />Tom Cruise in this film is a over-worked sports manager who has lost sight of what is important... after one of the players he is representing winds up the hospital the players kid asks him\\"Don't you think you should ask him to stop it's his forth concution.\\" Jerry quickly blows off the kid by saying \\"no one can stop your dad\\" and gets back to talking on his cell-phone. The kid then, gives him the finger and walks off. This a life changing event for Jerry for he realizes he has turned into someone he no longer wants to be. He then writes \\"The Things We Were Afraid To Say Aloud\\" memo to his co-workers about how they should be representing there players. Jerry then gets sacked from his job and loses all of his players except the loyal Cuba Gooding Jr.- Rod Tillwell who stays with him through and through. Jerry then leaves his job with Renee Zwelleger a single-mom, who was inspired by Jerry's memo. They form there own branch of representation and secretly Renee gets attracted to Jerry especially since Jerry loves her son so much. Only problem Jerry can't commit despite the fact he married(just so he could be dad to her son). I won't give away the ending, but this is what a romantic comedy should be not over the top and funny.<br /><br />Finally a romantic comedy that really is a comedy-<br /><br />One of my favorite lines is \\"After two bottles of wine and a bad pizza I suddely grew a conscience.\\"<br /><br />Or the hilliarous \\"Show me the money!\\" scene<br /><br />Or Jerry's major blow-up as he leaves the office. Those scenes still make me laugh each time I watch them.<br /><br />The actors are what made this movie deserve high stars. Cuba got a well-deserved Oscar for his hilliarous yet thoughtful character. And Tom Cruise as most times is fabulous as Jerry McGuire he really made this whole movie.I find myself falling in love with him each time I see this movie... and in this one girls you see that wonderful cocky sweetness he brings to the screen.

B000001DTM|5.0|Hard to find the right superlative for this album.<br /><br />It works as an ALBUM, by the way; less so as a bunch of singles, and please don't think of playing it on shuffle!  There's a story in there that unfolds chronologically.<br /><br />I really respect the fact that U2 stuck it out and reinvented themselves in 90/91, though I realize it's a trite cliche at this point.  You have to credit a band that handles the up and down.  Joshua Tree: up.  Achtung Baby: down.  The Joshua Tree feels really good, but there's something deeper in this album.  It's less idealistic and more honest.  Maybe that's why some find it too dark or depressing.  It reminds me of the psalmists.  You can read them moaning and groaning at God in one chapter and praising him the next, and it doesn't feel one bit inconsistent.  Honest and totally refreshing.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Troy surprised me based on some of the reviews being portrayed online and the newspaper. Mind you-it's not the best way to spend almost three hours of your life but, it's not the worst either. Rarely is a movie done that guys and girls might both enjoy the guys will love the action fight scenes while the gals will swoon over Brad Pitt.<br /><br />This movie must have cost millions to make with the all-star cast, stunning costumes, the music, and thrilling fight scenes this movie did not fail to impress me and in my opinon it deserved some nodds from the oscars particulary concerning the accuracy and detail in the costumes.<br /><br />I can't believe how many people were critcising the fact that the movie strayed from the \\"Illiad\\" personally I thought this was a good thing considering I had to suffer reading that book in high-school. The movie is actually in my opinon better than the book which strains the borriness and pettiness of the Gods who decide the fate of the doomed city. It also was not just based on the Illiad but I saw refrences from the Aenid as well(The Roman version of the Illiad). And yes the Trojan war lasted twelve years I believe and in this it lasts a period of a couple of months.<br /><br />The cast does a very good job particularly from Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. Peter O'Toole also did great as King Priam an actually honorable king. I however was not impressed by Orlando and can find the only reason why he has made it into acting is his pretty face. Sorry Girls- he's a model not an actor! But, you will not notice him when you have such performances from cuties Brad and Bana!<br /><br />This movie is all about, love, honor, and immortality. With great action squences and wonderful love scenes- this is a movie to rent on movie night. The only thing I have to critcize about this movie and the only reason this flick didn't recieve four stars from me would have to be the melodramatic screenplay which in my opinon ruined what would have been a great film.<br /><br />This is one of those movies I would rent for movie night, but not buy.reat film. <br /> <br />This is one of those movies I would rent for movie night, but not buy.   <br /> <br />
B000001FA4|4.0|This album was definitely sandwiched by two better ones (War in 1983 and Joshua Tree in 86/87) but it's a great album in its own right.  The major weakness are a few tracks that I can only describe as murky and pointless.  I think some B-sides would have been better in their place, but I realize U2 was going through a very EXPERIMENTAL phase here.<br /><br />Anyway, what boosts this up to a 4-star rating are a handful of excellent songs that I'll never get tired of hearing and belong to the canon of amazing U2 and 80s tracks.  Pride and Bad are probably the two best.  The album as a whole is representative of the new U2 sound that for me is like a time warp to the mid 80s (in a good way).  Also, though you might not like the production on this album as much as their newer (or older) stuff, you can still feel the band's energy and investment in their music with a hint of Bono's egomania just around the corner.  They were definitely striving for something, and at moments they were dead on.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First off: I've never been a fan of Slipknot. I can't call myself a \\"maggot\\" and I think anyone who desires to be a maggot may have a serious self-esteem problem and may also want to seek proffesional help. Oh yeah, and this album is amazing! When I first heard the single \\"Duality\\" I loved it but didn't think too much of it, because I didn't like their self titled cd or Iowa, and they both had singles that I really enjoyed (Wait and Bleed) and (My Plague). Then when I heard Vol. 3's 2nd single Vermillion, I needed to hear more. I was very suprised with what I heard on the rest of the album; they seem to have taken themselves much more seriously this time around and are establishing themselves as the great musicians that they are instead of trendy rapping clowns. <br /> <br />The music on Vol. 3 has less of a nu-metal vibe and is much more complex and unpredictable, as well as much more melodic. The heavier tracks such as \\"The Blister Exists\\", \\"Three Nil\\" and \\"Opium Of the People\\" destroy more than Slipknot have ever destroyed before. \\"Vermillion\\", \\"Before I Forget\\" and \\"The Nameless\\" seamlessly weave together crushing riffs and also incredible melodies. There's even some great acoustic tracks here, my favorite being \\"Vermillion Pt. 2\\", but \\"Circle\\", and \\"Danger\\" are also great. <br /> <br />To describe Vol. 3 in one word: focused. Slipknot have really put together a solid album here. If you consider yourself a fan of heavy music/metal and have never liked Slipknot before, check this out... you might be suprised with what you find here. Fans of earlier Slipknot should definitely check this out also, even though a lot of the die-hard fans seem to be slightly dissapointed with this release.
6305388458|5.0|In short: you NEED this movie! It is a hard-hitting revelation on what really happened 2,000 years ago or so.<br /><br />This movie is perhaps Monty Python at their comic best, slaughtering this sacred cow with gusto and with style. Python's eye for comedic opportunity is in top form with this movie, as they deal blow after blow to the issue of Messiah-hood.<br /><br />Keep a box of tissues handy for the tears of pain. The laughter is really going to hurt. You have been warned. :-)
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Now this is what I'm talking about. I do have one of the original classic versions of Disney's: Alice In Wonderland on DVD. This; however, is what I've been looking for all along!  <br /> <br />The film is still a beautiful little story that Disney animation brought to life of Lewis Carroll's classic tale of a little curious girl with a wide imagination called Alice. Who one day enters a world called Wonderland. And upon entering she finds herself growing up, growing small, meeting unforgettable characters such as: The Mad Hatter, The Caterpillar, The Cheshire Cat, Tweedledee/Tweedledum, The White Rabbit, and everyone's favorite mean queen The Queen of Hearts. Not to mention the talking and singing flowers & the loveable story of The Walrus & The Carpenter. <br /> <br />It's all about the beautiful extra's in this DVD. Generally if I'm happy with the old version of the DVD I don't buy another similar version. This was one of those exceptions - not too mention it's Disney. Mainly because it has: Thru the Mirror (my all time favorite short original Mickey Mouse feature), all sorts of games with songs & more, trivia, a new additional song, An Alice Comedy, Operation Wonderland (which is featured on the original VHS/DVD version I believe), & just tons more! If your a fan of Alice in Wonderland this is the DVD to buy!!!
0679411585|5.0|First, let's look at what this book is not: It is not beautifully written, it is not the story of one person's experience and it is not dedicated to character building. If you are looking for those things, then look elsewhere.  <br /> <br />Now if you are looking for the smell, the horror, the courage and the sacrifice of the battlefield, then you will find it in this work. Moore and Galloway have written a book that will serve as a textbook for generations of people who want to know what war is really like in a very objective manner - the heroism, the great leadership, poor leadership, mistakes, and occasional cowardice. It pulls no punches and takes people and organizations to task where appropriate. It is truly an amazing work and one that should be read by anyone when a debate on going to war is raging.  <br /> <br />The book is in three distinctive parts: The fight on Landing Zone X-Ray; The Fight on Landing Zone Albany; and the aftermath of the battles, for both the US involvement in Viet Nam and some of the families affected by it. Moore was the Battalion Commander at X-Ray and gives a very good view of the decisions he made and why he made them. He is able to walk us through the battle and describe the critical actions by both the North Vietnamese and the US forces that turned the tide of this battle and allowed Moore's force to win a victory. There are many first person accounts of different aspects of the battle given by the US soldiers that fought there and also by some of the key North Vietnam leaders.  <br /> <br />The second part of the book was about the relief battalion's retrograde back from LZ X-Ray to LZ Albany. Moore was not here so all of the reporting was done thru interviews after the fact. He is pretty scathing in some of his assesments of the decisions being made - although if you do not have military experience you might not find the writing scathing enough for what happened. He describes the complecency by some of the leadership on the movement back, the failure to set out decent security and the indecisiveness in the early moments of the battle. He also points out the slow flow of information from Albany to the higher levels of the US Forces. Albany was fought to a draw with horrendous losses on both sides after a North Vietnamese battalion and the 2/7 Cav had a meeting engagement (which means they ran into eachother in the woods). One lead company was almost completely slaughtered, save a few people that had to do an E&E (Escape and Evasion) in order to get to safety. The book contains three accounts of men that did that.  <br /> <br />The final part of the book looked at the political decisions made in the aftermath of the war using declassified top secret memos written by Sec McNamara to illustrate that he knew very early in the war that it could prove to be unwinnable, putting the odds at a US victory at no better than 1 in 2. Also, there are personal accounts from the widows and the children of some of the men that died in the battles. Since I am in Iraq right now with the Army, and I have a two year old daughter, I found these passages particularily moving.  <br /> <br />My only gripe with this book, is that your understaning of it is assisted greatly if you have been in the military. Since I am, it is no problem, but for someone walking in with no experience, a lot of the terminology used and the prose itself will make following the story a little more difficult. It reads almost exactly like an After Action Review, which probably is the proper voice for this piece, but some readers will have problems with it - as evidenced by some of the earlier reviews.  <br /> <br />The bottom line - very honest, interesting, work. It will help the reader understand battle, and perhaps understand it a little more than they would like to. Highly recommend.
0596007124|5.0|Since design patterns are about ways of organizing code in order to make it easier to understand and to manage, it should not be all that strange that the authors are also intersted in how to organize a book along the same principles.<br /><br />Still I was a bit skeptical.  This is the first book that I have seen in the Head First series. I have seen other books with cute graphics and came away disappointed because I felt I was being talked down to or because I thought the authors were not very knowledgeable.<br /><br />I am happy to report that my fears were not realized.  As the authors make clear in the introduction, they put a lot of work into making this book accessible.  They succeeded immensely.  It is also clear that they know whereof they speak with regard to the material covered.  I have had trouble getting through the dry material on design patterns in other books.  This book was a real eye opener.  I higly recommend it to others who are having trouble understanding patterns.  I can now see what all the fuss has been about and why it is so important for programmers to understand this material.<br /><br />One criticism that I have is the code presented for the composite design pattern.

B00004BZ0V|4.0|Being a beginner to The Clash and punk music in general, I was keen to listen to the CD after my Dad bought it.  I suppose I was hoping to blast some of the stereotypes I had about punk being a three-chord, one-dimensional genre.   <br /> <br />Well, listening to this CD did just that.  The musical depth and lyrical intensity of this band seriously exceeded any preconceived ideas I had about what punk music should sound like.  I'm very happy to say that, now, I'm a fan. <br /> <br />My favourite songs from this CD are 'London Calling', 'Clash City Rockers', 'English Civil War' and 'Tommy Gun'. <br /> <br />I think this is a good representation of the band's overall sound and this would be a good place for beginners to start.  It worked for me!
B000286S8S|5.0|I was lucky enough to see VH twice this last year( events center at mandalay bay in Vegas and Key arena in seatle) they rocked the house! it was truley amazing. this c-d has been remixed so it is brighter crisper, than the albums they came from. the tracks are so much more powerful than the original recordings! as far as some of the reviewers saying that there was something wrong with the ending of \\"Finish what you started; Glen  Ballard who remixed this, along with Eddie and Alex says on the official VH website,; the original track mix ends exactly as presented on the new best of both worlds. the first matering was faded manually, and that is how it appears on ou812. this is without a doubt the better greatest hits c-d by far! more songs, better mix. the three new songs are awesome!. i listen to them more than anything else! hard rocking, crunchy, new Van Halen! would recomend this c-d highly!
6305603847|5.0|When I saw this movie when I was like 8 I was scared to death. But now that I'm 19 I love it. I rented this movie like 2 years ago I love it. If you love Pink Floyd you'll love this movie. The whole movie goes to the tune of the wall. Excluding a couple of songs this is one of the best movies you'll ever see. It's about a burnt out rock star. Songs you'll hear in this movie are Another brick in the wall pts 1-3, Comfertly Numb, Is there anybody out there, and many more. Buy this movie it's great.
B0006J28KU|5.0|When I first saw Heat I liked it, but I thought it was too long and I didn't really like the ending. I thought it dragged at times and I wanted the other guy to win the duel. When I saw it again I had the same feeling. But now after watching it for maybe the fifth or sixth time, it hit me in a different way. Now that I am more familiar with Michael Mann's style, I have a better appreciation for Heat. The acting is superb and the writing is tight. And Mann's signature detached, surreal style is perfectly done. Heat is a bold and dramatic epic of right versus wrong, ideology versus ideology and man versus man.

0761119752|5.0|My 2-year-old (in may) niece loves this. She recognizes it by name, pulls it out to request it, everything.  <br /> <br />I don't find it hard to read at all. I agree, it probably *should* be sung, but I find it simple to just chant the book.  <br /> <br />The only caveat I'd put here is that you should read this book *first* in your bedtime routine. It's a bit active, and you're likely to end up with a bouncy baby if this is the only book you read. So read Pajama Time, and then follow it up with a more calming book - Goodnight Moon, The Going to Bed Book, The Napping House, whatever you read to your kid.

And then you could drag out J Lo to play Squeaky Fromme, and keep the \\"reality\\" in high gear, eh?
0805047905|4.0|For a long time, she wasn't very interested in the book. However, I persisted, reading it to her at naptime (under the theory that it was a simple repetitive book and should put her right to sleep) and making the appropriate animal sounds at each page (rarrr for the bear, whinney for the horse, etc.)<br /><br />Now she's nearing two, and she'll read the book with us, making the sounds herself. Not all children are interested in this sort of book, and I understand that it can be hard for some children to relate to it, since the pictures aren't that realistic, but it doesn't take much creativity to make the repetitive book more interesting - similar to \\"finding the mouse\\" in Goodnight, Moon.
B000003TA4|1.0|Something tells me that Nirvana could have acheived as much musicality if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical instruments.  Everybody thinks it was Korn, but it was really Nirvana who were the true founders of this \\"nu metal\\" teenage angst garbage.  You can blame Nirvana for all those annoying \\"mallcore\\" bands like Korn, Nickelback, and Linkin Park that have dominated the rock charts since the 1990s.  Almost everything bad about today's music started with Nirvana--monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, walls of distorted guitar noise, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is. <br /> <br />Do you Nirvana fans really believe all the hype about Nirvana \\"killing off hair metal\\" and \\"saving rock n roll\\"?  Nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things.  Nirvana were not about music.  They were about conformity, and nothing more.  Just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a fad, and separate a bunch of naive, whiney, immature, suburban teenagers from their money.  They were the Backstreet Boys with guitars.  The Linkin Park of 1988-1994.  I hold Nirvana fully responsible for everything bad that has happened to popular music in the 90s and the 21st century.  Their influence on the pop punk, emo, and nu metal genres is undeniable.  They ruined music. <br /> <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I purchased both the CD and the DVD and they are both fantastic.  I would recommend both to anyone who enjoys this type of music.  I find it very relaxing after a long day.  Everytime I watch or listen to the wonderfull songs I am still amazed at how they match each other styles and hamony.  And even to this day this music still relaxes me.
B00005JNTV|4.0|This is a love-it or hate-it movie if ever there was one.  Most of the audience that I saw it with loved it, but my friend thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen.  Of course, he's not into comic books.  The real significance of this film is that (with the possible exception of the Hulk) this is the movie that most captures the feel of a comic book.  Not only does it feel like \\"a comic book\\" - it feels like THE comic book, Sin City. <br /> <br />Sin City is a series of black and white graphic novels in the \\"noir\\" style by Frank Miller.  Miller shares directing credit on this film, along with Roberto Rodriguez.  Not only was Miller on set every day but the film IS ALMOST A SHOT-FOR-SHOT TRANSLATION OF THE GRAPHIC NOVELS.  I've only read the first in the series, but I don't really feel the need to read the other two that this film is based on because I believe they will be exactly the same.  Rodriguez has used the panels from the comics as storyboards and re-created them as faithfully as possible.   <br /> <br />The film of Sin City is also the first film to capture the modern conception of comic book violence.  Remember the good old days when the term \\"comic book violence\\" referred to superheroes like Captain America duking it out and never suffering greater injury than a black eye?  Not any more.  In the adult, gritty comics, the emphasis is on pain, torture, sadism, and especially dismemberment - I lost track of how many characters get dismembered.  This is possibly the most violent and goriest movie I have ever seen.  Because it is mostly in black and white, blood shows up white.  Characters take and dish out more punishment than could ever be possible in real life. <br /> <br />Possibly, the people who do not like this film are put off by its gruesomeness.  I don't know if the audience is meant to take pleasure in the torturing of the bad guys simply because they are villains.  Certainly, there are no \\"good guys\\" in this movie - just anti-heroes (with the possible exception of the Bruce Willis character).   <br /> <br />Also, people who are not into comic books may have a hard time with the film.  Most of talking in the movie comes from voice-over narration because 1) it is a nod to film noir and 2) it is an almost direct transcription of the comic book.  However, I've never seen voice-over used this extensively, and - as the movie Adaptation tells us - voice-over is a cinematic no-no.  Some people may be put off by it. <br /> <br />Regardless, I've never seen a movie ANYTHING like this before.  If you're into graphic novels, film noir, or over-the-top comic-book violence - or just movies with an original voice - check it out. <br /> <br />SPECIAL NOTE: This is NOT a movie for little kids and I was horrified to see parents taking their toddlers into the theater.   <br /> <br />  <br />
0671891634|3.0|I have not read Peter Lynch's first book but read this one.  It's a great story of how Lynch turned Magellan into the largest mutual fund of that time.  Some of the stories of now great companies are also very interesting.  The problem is that I bought this book so I could \\"beat the street\\".  Well if I do it like Peter I will pick up the phone tommorrow on my lunch break and call the CFO of Intel to see how cash flow has been this quarter...or perhaps fly out to California next week to visit the Controller of some company to see if they are complying with SOX.  These things are great for the fund managers but not a small investor like myself.  Essentially the summary of what I got from this book is:  Buy stocks of good companies that analysts are not looking at or that everybody else is selling.  A good company will always come back around.  It was a great story though !!  Always remember: get this book at the library like I did and save your money for a share of Home Depot.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|To read all of this review or many more like it check out my music review blog @ [...]    \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" (which by the way is a wicked name for an album) hits stores tomorrow and don't be surprised if you see it high on the Billboard charts this week. The success of their previous effort \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" catipulted Queens of the Stone Age into the mainstream, and listening to this album I am quite sure they aren't looking back. In fact, this album has a sound that will likely be even more popular than the last album.    In between the last album Q.O.T.S.A lost a key member in Nick Oliveri and so that raises a warning flag right away. Nick Oliveri often was on vocals, and usually was responsible for the the more aggressive metal sounding songs. Josh Homme on the other hand, was usually at the forefront on the more playful, or catchy sounding songs. One listen to this album and it is apparent that the band is taking a few large steps away from the really loud songs, and moving closer to the infectious playful dance-rock sound that Josh Homme was a part of with the Eagles of Death Metal. The record label likely loves this move by the band, but personally I am a bit on the fence about it.    \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" has 13 songs, an intro and a secret track. Unlike the last album it doesn't play through flawlessly, and unlike the last album some songs are distinctly better than others. However, the only reason I would label this album as a touch of a disappointment is because this was a band that had a chance to move into my top elite group of bands with an album on the same level as \\"Songs For The Deaf\\". Instead, they seemingly regressed a bit. However, the guitar is still awesome and most of the songs still manage to get stuck in your head every time you listen. If this album was a cake, it would leave you wondering what ingredient it is missing. I'm still trying to figure that out.    .....      I've heard this album like five or six times now in the spanof maybe a week, so I don't really see it growing on me much more than it has. I guess the best way to sum up my feelings is that I considred this album an automatic purchase, but now I am not so sure I will buy it. It is decent for sure, but with all the music I hear decent sometimes doesn't cut it. That money might be better spent elsewhere. The album lacks the vision of the last album, and the cohesion of the last album as well. I woulda let this by if this was a debut album, but it isn't. When a band digresses it always raises a big warning sign for me. It isn't even that the album has a bunch of bad songs, all the songs are at least decent. But of the 13 only 5 or so really stand out and when I hear the other ones I just wanna skip to the ones I prefer. This album leaves Josh Homme with a big decision to make. His band is now right on the cusp of moving away from stoner rock (which is what made them popular in the first place), and moving into mainstream rock territory. Once you make that move, it is nearly impossible to go back. What's it gonna be Josh?    Songs you should download: \\"Burn The Witch\\", \\"Little Sister\\", \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\", \\"You've Got A Killer Scene There Man\\", \\"The Blood Is Love\\"    SCORE: 7.8 (I can't give the album anything but a quality score as it is a quality album. However, I woulda scored \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" likely a 9. So draw from that what you will, I still predict this is by far the biggest record of Q.O.T.S.A's career so far.)
B00005K3LU|5.0|\\"Die Hard\\" very well may be. Released in 1988, it was a groundbreaking success, spawning far too many imitations to count. Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop caught up in the wrong place and the worst time: he's alone in a skyscraper, up against a dozen well-armed terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman playing one of cinema's greatest villains). What follows are some of the most exhilarating action sequences I've ever seen in a movie: the rooftop shootout, the famous \\"elevator shaft\\" scene, the helicopter explosion, and the final death of the bad guy. <br />Make no mistake: this movie rocks. The acting is pretty good for an action movie. Willis is fantastic as the protagonist, Rickman is slightly unsettling as the ruthless villain. All of the smaller roles are memorable as well. \\"Die Hard\\" is the best of its kind.

B000002L68|5.0|\\"Purple Rain\\" is widely considered Prince's crowning achievement (I personally believe he peaked with \\"Sign 'O' The Times\\"). It was arguably the biggest album of 1984; Prince truly ruled the charts that year. The album gave him three Number Ones and superstar status. <br />The biggest question is: does it hold up? Yes, it does. To a point. Most of the songs sound like they were recorded in 1984, but they also have a nice, retro feel to them. Prince is an extraordinary talent. His music is unique, weird, bizarre--and yet they're cool at the same time. With this album, Prince gets to show off his amazing talents as a guitarist. Listen to the killer solo at the end of \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" or the entire length of \\"Purple Rain.\\" You'll understand what I mean. <br />Don't let the 80's sound scare you away. This is an outstanding album.
0140386335|5.0|This is one of the few books I have choosen to read mord than once (at least 3 times).   <br /> <br />I was introduced to this book by a friend.  I was in High School, I had seen the movie in my younger days, but was unimpressed, I also had no idea that there was a book.  I read the book on my friend's recommendation, I was very impressed.  The movie did not do the story justice and took way too much artistic license. <br /> <br />The story began and I wished that it would never end.  I felt the same way Bastian does when he reaches the end of a story and doesn't want to leave the characters.  This is one of the few books that I have gotten completely into.  I was so involved in the story that I even found myself holding my breath as Falkor dove into the water to retrieve the Auryn. <br /> <br />I love that there are 26 chapters and each begins with a letter of the alphabet, which are illustrated (I did not notice this until the 2nd or 3rd time).  There is one infuriating thing:  'That is a story to be told at another time..\\".  Which of course never were, I looked for another book by the Author in which he did tell them at another time, but no such luck.  I may just have to write them myself. *sigh* <br /> <br />Any way I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes fantasy or just a good story.
B0000060NF|5.0|Any barebones Marvin Gaye collection should include a good compilation of his 60's hits as well as Let's Get It On and this one.  What's Going On found Gaye breaking free from the Motown hit-making apparatus to produce an artistic statement that has since become a cornerstone of R&B and one of the all time great records.  It's instructive that only an artist of Gaye's stature was allowed to get away with something like this at the time on Motown.<br /><br />The title track is one of his greatest and has rightfully become an R&B standard.  Gaye's gritty, streetwise lyrics set the tone for what's to come.  \\"What's Happening Brother\\" concerns a dazed and confused returning Vietnam War vet while \\"Flyin' High (In The Friendly Sky)\\" is about the dangers of drugs.  Considering his own habit and circumstances of his sad demise, it's eerie to hear him sing lines like \\"I go crazy when I can't get it...the pain, oh the pain.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" is another of Gaye's best songs and for me is the high point of the album as Gaye welds a classic and hypnotic beat to ecology-minded lyrics.  Another classic hit, \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\" closes out the set.  Despite it's fair share of hits, this record was sequenced so that each song flows into each other, with a singular purpose of music and lyrics that makes it best heard from beginning to end in one sitting.<br /><br />What's Going On not only pushed the boundries wide open on R&B subject matter, but experimented musically as well.  Starting with background \\"party\\" sounds and adding bongos, congas and other percussion, full horn and string sections and lush backing vocals make this an almost symphonic form of R&B.<br /><br />A truly remarkable recording, and quite possibly the best R&B album ever.  A must for any comprehensive collection.
B000089RVX|5.0|If you're looking for REAL heavy metal and if you are sick of that old fake crap (Megadeth, Dream Theater, 80s Metallica, Iron Maiden, Opeth, Queensryche, Borknagar etc - basically any of the clowns that only posers with no taste praise) then look no further. They show other talentless poser \\"metal\\" bands that solos suck and when they actually do solo - they do it better than any of those losers in the 80s. They show unknown posers with guitars like Malmsteen, Satriani, McLaughlin, Michael Romeo etc how to REALLY play an instrument. When I listen to this I feel soooooo deep. Like Amy lee, I am a tortured artist and too complicated and intelligent for the world to understand. That's why I'm anti-authority and anti-mainstream. Thankfully MTV caters to rebels such as myself.      LONG LIVE METAL!!!!1
B0006M4SO6|1.0|This sounds like what the band \\"Journey\\" would do if they had an all instrumental album.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Bottom line this is his best album out rated towards his others except Soundtracks.  <br />Slim Shady LP - 4.3 The Marshall Mathers LP - 4.895  <br />Eminem Show - 4.5  <br />Encore - 2.3  <br />These ratings are not from just my liking, but from production entirely.  <br />1. Public Service Announcement 2000 - 4.5 Creative, but he already did it.  <br />2. Kill You - 4.8 The beat is hot and his lyrics are not all over the place, on opic and good.  <br />3. Stan - (featuring Dido)- 4.4 His way of telling you not to take him that serious.  <br />4. Paul - (skit) - 3.6 His way of trying to say he worked hard. <br /> 5. Who Knew - 5.0 I made it they shouldn't hate on me.  <br />6. Steve Berman - (with Steve Berman) - 4.4 These expectations of me are to high.  <br />7. Way I Am, The - 4.99 A Very creative beat with the static and all. A true expressing of himself to the fullest.  <br />8. Real Slim Shady, The 4.0 - Let's just have fun with this hit single.  <br />9. Remember Me? - (featuring RBX/Sticky Fingaz) - 4.2 Another creative beat.

Marshall Mathers - 4.9 Good beat between rap and rock. I made it now you know me. Bye before I go crazy.  <br />12. Ken Kaniff - (skit) - 4.8 Very funy, making fun of people. 13. Drug Ballad - 3.5 A song to all the groopies.  <br />14. Amityville - (featuring Bizarre)- 3.0 How crazy I am.  <br />15. Bitch Please II - 4.3 Sweet track with all the homeboys.  <br />16. Kim - 4.8 The most emotion song of rap out. Just try to listen to the lirics.  <br />17. Under The Influence - (featuring D-12) - 5.0 If you don't like it, to bad.  <br />18. Criminal - 4.78 I'm treated like a criminal, so I must be. While he robs a bank.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Forget all I said about Incubus, SOAD, Korn, etc. This blows them all out of the water. It is pure genious. I don't know how they could've come to Emotive, that piece of crap, after building this masterpiece. APC has to be the only decent band, along with Incubus, that's still making decent albums in the millenium. MTV and radio's just full of this emo crap and black metal(COF, Shadows fall). APC is like the present day Pink Floyd. They truly are. <br /> <br />The Package(10/10) - Longest song on the album, and a great thing. It sound a little industrial/alternative based. <br /> <br />Weak and Powerless(9/10) - Filling my own grave to keep me level. Jam another dragon down the hole. W&P is full of trippy lyrics and great bass and drums. <br /> <br />The Noose(11/10) - With you haaaaaaaalooo slipping down. This song is just great. I could listen to it all day. Great vocals by Maynard. <br /> <br />Blue(9/10) - Cool lyrics. Trippy stuff here. Very Pink Floydish. <br /> <br />Vanishing(6/10) - I don't particually like it, but it's pretty good. <br /> <br />A Stranger(11/10) - I crave your...sweet insanity. It's great. It's more than great. Reminds me of the Noose. I love it when bands include relaxing violins in their songs. <br /> <br />The Outsider(10/10) - Wow, an anti-suicide song, noting the redundance of being \\"depressed\\" and \\"angry\\". Making fun of goths, perhaps? I hope.... <br /> <br />Crimes(8/10) - VERY eerie.That's all I can really say about this song. <br /> <br />Nurse Who loved me(10/10) what the hell is this song about? It's still cool and trippy. Say hello...to the rug's topography. <br /> <br />Pet(7/10) - I don't really like this song. This is my best friends favorite song on the album, I have no idea why. <br /> <br />Lullaby(3/10) - ummmm....no comment. I gave it a three because it's short. <br /> <br />Gravity(8/10) - It's a good song, but it's very forgettable. <br /> <br />So there you go. The near perfect circle.
0792163710|5.0|I read this book in the seventh grade and finally saw the movie yesterday.  It is the classic story of good versus evil with the saintly adorned in tan, rather than white, duds.  Shane is the quintessential hero who does not want to fight but is forced to.  He only desires peace but was not created to stand down like ordinary men.<br /><br />There are many things unusual about this western as Shane's relationship with the son, Joey, is the most ideal relationship possible between an older man and a boy.  There are no finer role models for youth than Alan Ladd's character.  Shane's interactions with the wife are noble without a hint of sexual tension.<br /><br />I know there are those who would say that the film is not believable due to its Manichean presentation of Good vs. Evil.  It is true that in Shane's dedication to protecting women and children (along with strangers who are kind to him) Ladd seems closer to angel than human being.  Yet isn't showing viewers something that we don't find in everyday life exactly what cinema is for?  Shane is not \\"realism\\", it is the regal and the flawless.  Unlike many contemporary movies, it avoids the unseemly elements of our existence which, if you ask me, are exactly the type of artistic ventures that we could use more of nowadays.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|It is rare that I'm captivated by a romantic movie. But this one truly hit home and left me in an emotional wreck after laeving the theaters. Jude Law, Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, and Natalie Portman are grade A in this movie. In this provoctive and risque movie about love and adultry, four people's lives are analyzed in depth as they explore the meaning of love and romance.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD completely astonished me when I first listened to it. It's now my favorite CD. Christina has undoubtedly matured immensely on this CD. Thre are no teeny-bopper songs featured and this CD is aimed at a more mature audience compared to her previous albums. However, kids and teens of all ages may be able to relate to some of the more personal songs, and everyone will enjoy the inspirational and uplifting songs. This isn't much of a club CD or even a dance CD either. Don't let the \\"Dirty\\" single fool you. There are probably around 3 club/dance joints on this CD. Everything else is either deep and personal or romantic and caring. You'll hear her lovely voice but with the lyrics it'll sound raw and uncensored; that isn't a bad thing either. If you wanted a more mature Christina, you'll find it in this CD.
B000002572|5.0|A few years ago, I started getting really into classic rock.  So I broke out my parent's old albums, and what was one of the first albums I listened to?  Boston's debut album.  I remember being just completely blown away by how a band could be this good.  So I quickly ran out to the store and bought this and their second album, Don't Look Back.  I remember listening to those two albums all day, everyday.  They're just that good, and this one is the better of the two. <br /> <br />Boston really just has a little bit of everything for everybody.  People who like bands like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin would be atracted to the heavy, distorted guitars that Boston uses in their music.  And fans of bands like Yes and Styx will be attracted to the great musicianship and talent that is in this band.  Also, Boston produces some of the most easily listenable, catchy songs, so even fans of pop music can get into this band. <br /> <br />There is some great talent in this band.  Their music in general is pretty sophisticated, with intricate guitar parts written throughout the songs.  They have three guitarists, one of which will sometimes switch over to the keyboards.  This gives them a very full sound and allows them to harmonize guitar melodies, producing a very nice sound.  Their singer is amazing, he's got a pretty high tenor voice with an excelent tone to it.  Its really pretty hard to find a better singer than him in rock and roll.  Also, their keyboard player is great, the solo in \\"Smokin\\" is one of the coolest things I've ever heard, its a real joy to listen to. <br /> <br />The production in the band is very good, they are quite commercial sounding and do not sound raw at all.  Some people complain about that, saying that rock and roll is supposed to sound dirty, but personally, I think that it sounds great.  And really, this is not much of an argument anymore, since most current bands are this produced.  But back then, to have this level of production was really pretty different.  They were quite ahead of their time. <br /> <br />Every single song on this album is just a joy.  They all have great musicianship, a perfect balance between the hard elements of bands like Black Sabbath and the progressive elements of bands like Styx, and their songs are so much fun.  Seriously, this is one of the most fun albums you'll ever listen to.  I believe that that is what's missing in today's music.  Everybody's so serious and dark.  Well, if you would rather listen to fun, happy music that still has lots of hard rock elements, then pick this album up.  Trust me, it won't dissapoint.
B0000648WZ|5.0|I'd like to comment on Roy Jaruk's post about this film.  First off, Starship Troopers is a brilliant science fiction film and a scathing satire of America's often misguided all conquering attititude. <br /> <br />Jaruk claims that this is a bastardization of Heinlein's book, but I completely disagree.  Heinlein wrote the book in the late fifties...  Before the Vietnam War, before the Cold War, before Iraq...  If Heinlein had written this book today, he would have told a story much closer to Verhoeven's, who has lived through those disillusioning years since the 50s and whose family was killed in the concentration camps during the Holocaust. <br /> <br />I applaud Verhoeven for updating this story for our time.  History can't be ignored.  The book worked in 1960 because the Kennedy's had not been killed yet, thousands of our children hadn't been slain in Vietnam yet...  Heinlein wrote a book that was true to his time.  Verhoeven took Heinlein's book and made a book that was true to his. <br /> <br />End of story.  This is a brilliant film.  The book is great as well.  Explore both.  The differences based on when they were made is tremendous.
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|Whew.  Like a lot of people here, I got into this band from the Songs for the Deaf album.  I thought they were a fresh, promising band.  Great songs, catchy as hell, diverse, intelligent, recorded INSANELY well.  Totally dry, in your face, and energetic.  The recording alone would have made that album great.  I bought the new album blindly, thinking \\"it can't be that bad\\"...well, one word:  BORING.  BORING AS HELL.  Sounds like the Eagles of Death Metal with overdubbed bass.  G'dddambit.  I wanted this to be good.  I REALLY did.  Horrible recording quality.  Sounds like a cheap cassette demo.  Good bass sound however, but sounds eerily trying to replicate the bass sound from the last album.  A couple songs, most notable, \\"Burn the Witch\\" are catchy, but that's it.  After I listened to it once, I saw them perform this song on Conan, and I thought maybe to try it again.  The first song is great!  Gotta admit that.  Then that damb lame-azz second song begins, with the basic power chords, no feeling, terrible recording quality, totally cheezy and overdone \\"ooh I have distorted vocals\\" effects, complete musical incompetence...and I just go \\"yuk\\".  Every song is recorded the same, with the same vibe, same tones, same keys, same EVERYTHING.  To listen this this whole album will bore you to death.  Sadly.  This guy, the \\"Craig Kilbourne\\" of rock, just can't do it alone, and he's a typical \\"I'm cool, I smoke, I do drugs, I'm a punk\\" loser who just can't cut it; he still even thinks that mentality is \\"cool\\".  Probably thinks Matt Damon was a \\"cool\\" actor as well in \\"My Bodyguard\\".  This guy is just so readable and typically generic that it boggles the mind.  Reviewers are creaming over themselves trying to say \\"rock is alive\\" with this album; that's just wishful thinking.  Their last great album, SFTD, was a fluke.  I won't be buying into this band again.  One good fluke album does not a good band make.
6301966562|5.0|I TOTALLY agree with others who have requested that this movie be made available in DVD format.  I have been checking for this option every month for YEARS!!!!!!!
B0002OERI0|2.0|If I have to hear one more song from this album I'm going to lose my mind.  Armstrong woke up one day and thought he was Roger Waters.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have the writing ability or the talent.  Oddly enough I love Green Day (usually), but a Rock Opera? C'mon!  Peter Townshend is crying somewhere.  Oh well.    Oh, by the way.  When your one of the biggest bands in America, and you blatantly steal riffs and beats from other bands, you should probably credit them.      P.S.  Man these guys have lost their credibility. Next time you release an album and claim it has nothing to do with politics, please don't come back a year later and claim it has  a strong political message. Wake Me Up is and was never about 9/11 so why is it all of a sudden about just that?  How much more money/respect/acknowledgment do you need?
B0007OCG4W|2.0|There are facets to admire, in \\"Closer\\" including the acting and themes, but the film is undermined by artificial, stilted dialogue and situations that just do not feel real. Mike Nichols has a brilliant history of bringing complex plays to dazzling life on the screen (notably \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" and \\"Angels in America\\"), but here, I beleive, he falters. Some plays just do not translate well to film, and \\"Closer\\" unfortunately, is one of them. <br /> <br />I wanted so much to like this film. We need films that deal in a serious and penetrating way with the complexities of relationships and loving another human being. \\"Closer\\" aspires to this goal, but fails to reach it. I did not believe one scene in this film, and I found the many of the exchnges between the characters heavy-handed and all too theatrical. The whole film felt like artifice, like it was playing tricks with the audience comparable to the way the characters deceived each other on screen. And that is a shame, because it's ultimate themes- that we really cannot know another human being fully, and that there are limits to truth and love in a relationship- are potent and thought provoking. <br /> <br />This is truly a situation where fascinating parts do not form a cohesive whole. Milke Nichols interesting direction, Clive Owen's sly, stunning performance, and its complex themes do not, unfortunately, save \\"Closer\\". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000021YQV|1.0|thank god this ridicolous genre of \\"rock\\" (!) is dying because never in history music has been so poor. <br />but the most otrageus thing is that this bunch of wannabe \\"musicians\\" have said that the immortal and great led zeppelin was a source of inspiration for them...hahahahah <br />led zeppelin wrote masterpieces and they were all real musicians and robert plant a marvelous real singer. <br />the only band with a zeppelin sound today are the darkness. <br />I really hope that america will redescover real rock music,and a good way to do is listen to soul sirkus a wonderful real rock band with the grea neal schon and jeff scott soto into it.
B00070DK5K|1.0|I am stunned that this album receives ANY favorable reviews.  I am a Bowie fanatic, having taken in a dozen of his shows stretching back to 1978, and have owned every album of his.  This is not just his worst album....it is THE worst live album EVER by ANY performer.  The arrangements are sloppily played/plastic soul cum art rock and I am sure his whole band is embarassed at how they sounded on record.  As bootleg aficionados know, there ARE good shows from the 1974 tour.  This album somehow manages to give them a complete miss.  As for David himself, he is in the nadir of his cocaine addiction and simply can NOT sing here.  His voice is Awful throughout, making even this hardcore Bowie fan cringe!!  Buy \\"Stage\\" instead--when he was not coked to the gills croaking out plastic soul in front of a band that could not care less--what a difference a few years makes.
B000001F3C|5.0|Passionate, angry, political and lyrical, this is U2 at their youthful best. Before they became overly wrapped up in their image as &quot;pop&quot; stars, U2 was a great, great rock band that truly believed it could change the world through music. The early, hungry U2 remains my favorite, and &quot;War&quot; is that band at its absolute peak. With heart-rending love songs like &quot;New Year's Day,&quot; &quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot; and the haunting &quot;Drowning Man,&quot; along with the politically charged and equally passionate &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday,&quot; &quot;War&quot; remains arguably the best album U2 has ever produced.
6305922756|5.0|I just watched the induction ceremony for this year's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (2005) and, by far, the best speech came from The Edge, the guitarist from U2.<br /><br />He appeared grateful to be inducted but mentioned that, in all honesty, every band in rock fears becoming Spinal Tap.  There were a few laughs, but mostly there seemed to be an eerie dread from the famous audience (and that made his comment that much funnier!).<br /><br />The truth is that there is a lot of truth in THIS IS SPINAL TAP.  It really isn't that far off the mark from being an actual documentary!  About ten minutes of either MTV or VH1 should convince you of that.  At least with SPINAL TAP, you're aware of an intelligence behind the lunacy--and that's completely missing with those music channels.<br /><br />I actually saw Spinal Tap on tour in the early 1990's and it was easily the funniest rock concert I've ever seen (and they really played!).<br /><br />I remember telling co-workers I was going to see Spinal Tap and one of them, in complete seriousness, said, \\"Those guys suck!  I don't know why they play them on the radio!\\"<br /><br />The joke goes on....
B000063DFN|5.0|This is Maidens best album(to me anyways) it was their peak,now some people might dissagre, but after powerslave maiden started going downhill.Now almost every single song on here is great,it is packed with Dickinson's energy,Smith and Murrays epic riffs,Harris's unmatched talent and Mcbrain's powerful drumming.  This album contains most of maidens commercial singles,epic and powerfull tunes,and some fillers.Now when i say filler im talking about iron maidens standards,if these filler songs would be writen by anyone else they would be considered great.You defenietly get your moneys worth-the album cover is powerful,the songs are timeless and All the band members are at their peak,what else could you want from  a cd.So buy this masterpiece and worship IRON MAIDEN.
B000002LRX|5.0|So I bought this album based on it actually getting better reviews than The Real Thing, which is a fantastic album. <br /> <br />They were right. It is dark--I mean depressingly dark, not just romantically dark (like The Real Thing was), but it is absolutely astounding. For other imbellishments, read the other 174 before this one.
B000002H33|5.0|These is what music should sound like,It is my favourtie metallica album and to me its probably their best.Now this band has transformed into something else nowdays but this album paintes the ultimate metallica picture.Every thing about this album is worth getting-great cover,no filler songs,intelligent lyrics,complex and heavy riffs,nice bass lines and great drumming.But dont take my word for it, buy it for yourself,and i know i sound like a salesman but this album is really that good.It is up there with dark side of the moon,back in black,paranoid,rocks,led zeppelin IV and other classics. <br />Now about the album <br />1.Battery-The perfect opening track,mandotory thrash <br />2.Master of Puppets-Probably the best song on the album,has everything you could want in one song-Fast guitars,Great mellow breakdown. <br />Now the rest you'll have to find out by your self,so buy this album and support the god that is metallica. <br />
B00003CWRX|5.0|a standing-o for russell crowe, al picino and the rest of the cast for some really good acting, not to mention the plot which seemingly has a new twist around every corner. you know, i consider a good movie one which you can watch over and over and still find something new about it, something you missed the first few times; the insider is one of these movies. its a shame it didn't win any academy awards with all the nominations.
B000002UUX|5.0|Most people will remember Magadeth not for the great band they are, but for the band that has a former metallica band member in it.And saddly this is true but people who can get past that will find some of the best songs ever.Now this album is the definte megadeth album,everything here sounds just perfect.Some listeners might refuse to give it a chance because of the vocals, but like another reviwers said hes voice is like coffe it gets better every time you give it a listen.And most of megadeth best song our find here and let me say this,megadeth will drop a greatist hits in june and if they dont at least include 4 songs from this album then its not worth getting.So what are you waitng for drop the mtv  and hear some real music.
B00008ADPF|1.0|What more can you say about Nickelback that hasn't been said already, everyone in the know about rock music knows this band is a joke. Chad Kroeger WISHES he had half the talent of those whose music he makes a poor imitation of (Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden etc.) why on earth would anyone WANT to listen to this band, when they could listen to bands who's music Nickelback is deriving from, such as the bands  mentioned above, bands that actually PROGRESSED CHAD!, and didn't keep reusing the same f'ing tired chord progressions and riffs over and over...and over again to cash in on their lame formula(their CD's somehow sell millions). One reviewer put it perfectley, \\"Layne Staley= dead, Chad Kroeger= alive and healthy, life isn't fair\\" amen. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Throw this album out and go listen to Jar Of Flies instead, Nickelback have ZERO artistic integrity and are a disgrace to rock music
B0007P3582|1.0|God what crap!how do people call this music?Im tired of seeing so much rap everywhere,this is one of the worst trends ever.What do people see in this ,the lyrics  basicly are all bragging about how tough he is or sex.Maybe I dont understant something but how can someone turn down a pink floyd cd for this crap.He cant even playing an instrument but people call this music and somehow the recording industry keeps signing these no-talent rappers instead of talented musicains who actually make their own music.Please never get a rap album in your life and stick to good music that's thoughtful and talented like pink floyd,led zeppelin,iron maiden,judas priest,jimmy hendrix,van halen,etc.
B0000028M7|5.0|This album literally can send shivers up my spine with Layne Staley's tortured lyrics, this album often makes me wonder about Layne's addictions and how he spent his final days(and years) alone in his Seattle condo, losing his teeth(his gums turned black at the end), gang green in his arms, that Layne refused to have treated, to finally rotting away dead for 2 weeks after overdosing, Dirt was most definatley a tragic sign of things to come.  Layne knew heroin was killing him but simply couldn't kick his habit.  Heroin would also go on to claim the life of Layne's fiancee in 1996, which further pushed Staley over the edge into even deeper use.  Layne's use of the drug was becoming apparent around 1992, the year this album was released with songs like \\"Junkhead\\" \\"Godsmack\\" and \\"Down In A Hole\\" it was obvious what Staley was trying to convey a message that he was losing his battle with his near tear jerking vocals. Make no mistake, this was definatley one of the best albums of the 1990's period. Not one song that needs to be skipped, but be warned, this album is extremely heavy and i believe should be pulled out most at a time where you can just sit and absorb it all. Best songs on the album, \\"Rain When I Die, \\"Sickman\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Angry Chair\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\", and \\"Would\\". RIP Layne Staley (1967-2002)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If anyone hasn't got the picture now that I LOVE STEPHEN SCHWARTZ!!! I love very thing he has done, Godspell, Pippin, The Magic Show, Children of Eden and now Wicked. It took me a while to get this album because I was tired of it before I heard of it. All of my friends love it. Kids in the school choir sings songs from it. Show choirs of all across the country use the songs as part of their program. I couldn't get away from it. Now that I have it, I am glad I did. Like most of Schwartz shows it is lighthearted, songs like Popular, One Short Day, Defying Gravity and No One Mourns the Wicked are harmonal gems, like all Schwartz songs, so full of life and spirt that you can't help but listen. Wicked is sung everywhere, I just might find myself singing with them.
B000001F66|5.0|Many rock groups have been described as \\"progressive\\" during various times in their careers. To truly understand the definition of progressive rock, put yourself in 1968 listening to this album for the first time. The Moody Blues surpassed the Beatles with exquisitely complex orchestrations, using instruments that often were (and are) played only in obscure classical presentations. The lyrics are often incredibly spiritual without being denominational and without offending any specific denomination, a difficult feat in any era.<br /><br />This album was a follow up to the ground-breaking \\"Days of Future Passed\\" album, and set the expectations for all future Moodies albums. So many groups get into a groove, and keep playing that groove endlessly and monotonously. The Moodies made seven concept albums in a row, none of which was identical. Most were only similar in that they had elements of fantasy, science fiction, and hope for a better world and a better life. The expectations for each Moodies album was (and continues to be): what unusual thing are they going to try to do this time?<br /><br />In this album they played with using instruments to achieve various effects, such as the doors opening on the \\"House of Four Doors\\", and the combination of instruments on \\"Om\\" that evokes a feel of India without being Indian. The use of the sitar on this album is one of the best in a rock album.<br /><br />This album ranks as one of my all time favorites. There is no need to evaluate individual songs because they are all very good. This album deserves to be ranked with albums such as \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and Led Zeppelin's Runes or ZOSO album.<br /><br />In some ways you may consider this album as a peak for the Moodies; their subsequent albums are continually compared to \\"Days\\" and to \\"The Lost Chord.\\" Fortunately the Moodies have never been disheartened by the unexpected success of their first two albums, and have kept on making more music.<br /><br />If you are new to the Moodies, you will find this album to be one of their best. However, you will find that even an \\"average\\" Moodies album is better than the \\"best\\" of many other groups. Typical criticism of a Moodies' album comes from comparison to other Moodies' albums, because it is difficult to compare the Moodies to other groups.<br /><br />If you like this album, you may also enjoy \\"To All Our Children's Children's Children,\\" \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" and \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.\\" Each of these is similarly experimental, with varying degrees of success.<br /><br />Regardless of your feelings toward this album, it helped defined progressive rock as a genre with the few other progressive rock groups of the late 60s and early 70s, and will always hold a special place for those who looked for the next evolution of rock music beyond the Beatles.<br />If you are new to the Moodies, you will find this album to be one of their best.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|Okay, so first off I didn't know it was 99% CGI going in.  That might have colored my impressions some.  I liked the movie.  It definitely evoked an older feel, although I was often more reminded of Noir than adventure serials - it sort of bounced between the two, especially in the opening moments. <br /> <br />Overall I found it very watchable.  I like Jude Law, but I thought this movie could have used a more traditional hero, someone who would naturally make us think \\"hero\\". I'd like to have seen it made with Brendan Fraser.  That's kind of what the movie reminded me of more than anything else - it kept bringing in archetypes from the movies to evoke familiar feelings.  I found the ending a trifle anticlimactic, but it didn't ruin the whole movie for me.
0975991477|5.0|New Science Urges R&D/Pharma to Adopt a New Paradigm Based on Quantum Theory~ <br /> <br />Dr. Bruce Lipton has left no loopholes in describing what we now know about the brain and the mind/body connection as a result of both Quantum physics and the unexpected outcomes of the human genome project...which has set the pharmaceutical industry back at least ten years. He delivers the facts and hard science which create a strategic imperative for a shift from old paradigm Newtonian based research to an entirely new paradigm based on quantum mechanics and epigenetics.  <br /> <br />This book is a courageous and eloquent dissertation on what is soon to be recognized as classic leading indicator on the future of Research & Development in the pharmaceutical industry...in order to survive and thrive in the years to come but most importantly deliver the highest value to their patients. This is a 'must read' for anyone working in the Pharmaceutical Industry in order to understand what the future calls for given the new science of epigenetics. <br /> <br />This is also a must read for anyone who desires to be in control of their own life experience. Genes do not dictate biology...it is our response to environmental events or signals based upon our programmed belief system that create our life experiences. We now have a proven scientific and quantifiably measurable modality to change limiting, self sabotaging subconscious 'programs' into empowering and affirming subconscious programs in order to achieve our goals and visions for our ideal life experience.  <br /> <br />Like the human cell which responds to the environmental signals, we too respond to environmental signals in our world in accordance to our already established belief system. By changing our subconscious beliefs we have the power and the responsibility to create our desired experience in life. The ramifications for personal and professional development are so pervasive and scientifically validated that we cannot ignore this new information. Nor can the Pharmaceutical Industry ignore the strategic imperative to create a new paradigm~ leveraging this new information in order to provide the best health care with the fewest side effects, and highest profitability for all stakeholders.  <br /> <br />It remains to be seen which of the pharmaceutical giants will step up to the plate and lead the way as a trailblazer embracing and putting into practice the 'new science' and the increased viability and value that will flow through to all stakeholders...most importantly the patients or end users of their products/ prescriptions. I invite questions and comments and I challenge one of the big Pharma companies to step up to the plate and lead the pack into the future creating greater health and healthcare!  <br /> <br />I applaud Dr. Bruce Lipton for his courageous publication, proclamation of truth, which we all 'know' but has not yet been fully acknowledged or embraced. I also thank Dr. Lipton for his acknowledgment of PSYCH-K and PER-K as cutting edge modalities/ professional development programs for both individual and corporate peak performance, self actualization, and bottom line profitability (Return on investment of human capital).  <br /> <br />Most sincerely, <br />Dr. Allison Ashley <br />C.E.O. and President ~ Veracity International, Inc. <br /> <br />Also recommended: The Missing Piece/Peace in Your Life by Rob Williams; Dare to Be Yourself by Alan Cohen, As a Man Thinketh by James Allen; Molecules of Emotion; Leadership and the New Science by Margaret Wheatley; Superbeings by John Randolph Price <br />
0446677450|4.0|This book gets a lot of criticism that I think is undeserved.  The author does not claim to be the Peter Drucker of wealth or have all the answers.  Its a well done, somewhat anecdotal but useful book that can benefit most people.  I run an investment company and have observed first hand the types of things that the book speaks about.
B00005JNEW|4.0|Kickoff your Friday night at the movies with this action packed, emotional replay of the 1988 Odessa Texas high school football season.

Many high school scenes will bring you back to your glory days- the days of your memories. Remembering being 17 again is almost as good as being 17!
0140277447|3.0|This is a well written book. With data, photos, documents etc etc....  Even I, who doubt the existence of the massacre was almost made to believe the atrocity. I admit that Ms.Chang did quite a good job if it is considered to be a fiction. As Japanese, I would like to tell you something. <br /> <br /> There are many foreigners who believe that Japanese have never been sorry for what \\"happened\\". It is opposite. We have been sorry for what are believed to happen during WWII because we were taught so through many years of education in Japan. There are many soap operas, comics and documentaries which tell us \\"how brutal Japanese army was\\". I assume there are a lot of Japanese who dislike Japan for the past and they usually are very diffident about Japanese culture. Ask Japanese on the street about the Nanking Massacre. I am sure that more than half will say \\"It definitely happened. I am sorry.\\"  <br />  <br /> It is recent we started reconsidering our history, and it happened because solid evidences were found. Yet, many of us are still careful about speaking out against massacre because we well know how stupid and animal-like to deny if it really happened.  <br />  <br /> But once again, are we not allowed to speak out for our own justice? Do any of us try to fabricate anything? No. We just presented the evidence and some of you just play them down because, there is a premise that \\"Nanking Massacre Happened\\". It's a bit shame to admit that Japanese are not good at debate, but we are trying so hard to make sense. Here, many Japanese have presented evidences, so please take a look. People can never be convicted without any solid evidence, can they? <br />     <br /> Nanking Massacre is a huge issue, so we would like to ask you to be neutral once. We have been \\"it happened\\" side for couple decades and now, we've just started re-thinking. We will not be insanely stubborn. If the massacre is proven to be fact, we of course have to shame on us, and must do something about it.   <br /> <br />What Japanese are trying to do is not to fabricate history; we are only pursuing what really happened in Nanking.  <br /> <br />Please do not stick only this book. Go furhter to find out more, and please do either riddle or support Japanese ( I sound bit a masochist...).  <br />
B00002MZ4W|5.0|When the Pawn is a beautiful album.  Beautiful in the sense that it reveals its creators' psyche in an artful and expressive way and seems to legitimize creative expression in the pop music format.  The songs are challenging, and frequently dischordant, but strip back each layer and one finds sweetness, harmony, melodiousness that is rewarding because of the listening effort it takes to attain it.   The lyrics concern romantic relationships gone awry and yet transcend the immediate subject matter and achieve a kind of universal truth about the struggle for human connection.  The songs possess a striking authority and confidence, revealing the evolution from her debut, Tidal, a brilliant album in its own right.  Given the context of her wonderful third album, Extraordinary Machine, it is clear that Fiona's progression as an artist continues to be a consistent and spellbinding experiment.   There are few albums more important to me than this one.
B0002858YS|1.0|\\"Secondly, at least give these boys a chance. Obviously somebody likes them if they are getting airplay on the radio.\\" is what a previous reviewer said. <br />That is WHY people like them, because they're on the radio. It's more mainstream crap made for the radio just so that they can get fans. Note that the good bands who aren't mainstream crap aren't on the radio....NOFX Rancid Pennywise bet you've never heard of them because you're too busy listening to Green Day and that crap. <br />According to one of the spotlight reviews, this is a knockoff of Blur and The Cars and such. So WHY would you listen to a knockoff instead of the real thing??? Go buy Blur's self titled album and The Cars \\"Panorama\\" if you want REAL music of this style. <br />Have fun giving these guys your money and giving them fame you don't deserve. Or take my advice and listen to bands who need your help and are deserving of it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne is one of my favorite female singers because like a few others she is comfortable with her own self and does not care what others think. Avil Lavigne speaks out to everyone and I am glad she is around because I love her music mixed with that attitude. She rocks in my opinion and on her second c.d. I think she has really grown and is more open with her feelings even though it is hard to do that. Her second c.d. is even better than her first and I hope she continues to rock out. <br /> <br />Take Me Away- C- The only song I skip on her c.d. It is not a bad song but I just don't connect to it.  <br /> <br />Together- A- Great song. Period. <br /> <br />Don't Tell Me- A- Really speaks out, love it. <br /> <br />He Wasn't- A- This is where Avril shows her fun side again like Sk8er Boi style again and I'm glad she still has that fun side. <br /> <br />How Does It Feel- B+- Wow talk about going from fun to serious within a few minutes. This song is a lot like I'm With You off her first album, showing that softer side to her that is nice to hear once and awhile but I enjoy her when she's tough a lot more. <br /> <br />My Happy Ending- A- Avril Lavigne never stays soft for long and this next song she is kicking butt again. Love the song. <br /> <br />Nobody's Home- A+- Probably my most fav song by Avril ever I've always loved the song and this was the song that made me at last buy the song. It's just that good. <br /> <br />Forgotten- B- Not one of her strongest songs but I still like it. <br /> <br />Who Knows- A+- Another uplifting song that totally gets me ready to face a new day. <br /> <br />Fall To Pieces- B+- Nice song, kind of an awww kind of feeling song.  <br /> <br />Freak Out- A+- This song is awesome and speaks out so strongly to me. <br /> <br />Slipped Away- A+- One of her best songs made and very moving.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I became a fan of Frank Miller's work the day I opened the pages of \\"The Dark Knight Returns.\\"  Miller took the comic world by storm with his writing style.  His characters narrated panels instead of using thought bubbles. They were old, tired adults, not perky superheroes.  In Miller's hands, Batman became a weary war veteran desperately looking for a way to end his career without killing himself, Commissioner Gordon worried about his wife, and bad guys were Neo-Nazi naked monstrosities, all teeth and fangs.  It was a turning point for comics, transforming them into entertainment for adults, and the medium has never looked back since.  It was a turning point for my own writing as well; my stories from that point on took on a completely different feel, all inspired by Miller.<br /><br />Sin City is what happens when Miller is free to do what he wants.  He's a film noir fan at heart and Sin City is every bit an anachronistic blend of comic book action and pulpy dialogue. Fan of film noir will find all the iconic characters in Sin City: the weary integrity of a private eye, the pathos of a gangster past his prime, the desperation of a man wrongly accused of murder, the rage of a psychopath, and of course the femme fatale.<br /><br />Film noir is also about narration.  We hear the characters' thoughts and understand just how desperate and lonely they are.  By knowing our protagonists' minds, we can appreciate their paranoia and hopelessness.  And in film noir, the world is out to get everybody.  There are no good guys; indeed, often the authority figures that would be considered \\"good\\" (police officers, priests) are evil and the people deemed least ethical (prostitutes, murderers) are the heroes. Ultimately, whatever innocence any of the characters has is lost.  Sin City (short for Basin City, the very bottom of civilization) covers the entire spectrum.<br /><br />Sin City is actually three mini-movies combined, all taking place at approximately the same time.  The plots are from the graphic novels: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and The Big Fat Kill, with the short story threads The Customer is Always Right and Babe Wore Red thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The first and last scenes of the movie perfectly capture the tone of film noir: a beautiful girl and a mysterious dark-haired man meet somewhere.  We don't know the circumstances that brought them together but can feel the tension between them.  They act like lovers even though they've only just met.  But it can only end in blood.<br /><br />In The Hard Goodbye thread, Marv (Mickey Rourke), a giant monster of a man sleeps with the woman of his dreams, Goldie (Jaime King).  He awakens only to find her dead.  Marv's not good for much, but he's good at killing, so he gets revenge the only way he knows how: by punching people until they squeal. Eventually, Marv discovers a serial killer who has a taste for ladies of the night.  When the two finally meet, we learn that Marv can be just as depraved when he's out for revenge.<br /><br />No, seriously, it's probably one of the grossest things I've seen in movies in awhile.<br /><br />In The Big Fat Kill, Dwight (Clive Owen) is the new boyfriend of strip club waitress Shelley (Brittany Murphy).  Unfortunately, Shelley has an old boyfriend named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro), a bad guy who likes to beat up women.  Dwight is determined to stop Jackie Boy from killing anyone else, only to trail him to Dwight's own ex-girlfriend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Towne Girls.  The Old Towne Girls are prostitutes who run their own part of town.  There are no pimps, no dirty cops, and no mob.  Indeed, their part of town almost seems like some kind of nirvana for ladies of the night.  And of course, they all dress in extremely kinky outfits when they're not brandishing katanas, wicked-looking knives, throwing stars shaped like swastikas, or Uzis.  But Jackie Boy isn't who he seems and it's up to Dwight, Gail, and Miho (Devon Aoki) to keep a head (yes, I said HEAD) safe before a turf war explodes onto the streets.<br /><br />In That Yellow Bastard, another serial rapist (Rourk Jr., played by Nick Stahl) and son of a senator (Powers Boothe) is the one remaining loose end that good cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) can't put behind him.  On his last day of retirement, Hartigan decides to go after the untouchable Rourk Jr. and save Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), only to end up in prison for eight years for a crime he didn't commit.  We catch up with Hartigan later in the movie when he gets out of prison and discovers that the more things change, the more they remain the same.<br /><br />Except for Nancy, who in eight years grows up to be a major hottie, an attribute not unnoticed by poor, tortured Hartigan.<br /><br />There are too many villains to list here, but they are all memorable even in their few moments of screen time.  Three notable examples are the hilarious muttering of a lackey with an arrow sticking out of his chest, the elucidating thug who pronounces his every thought out loud Chandler Bing-style, and the hired mercenary who moved from bullets to explosives because, \\"you just can't go back to shooting people when you've seen a pub blow up and all the parts fly out.\\"<br /><br />By staying true to the original characters, the director (Robert Rodriguez) creates an entirely new film genre.  It makes better use of digital effects first showcased in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, and yet never forgets its comic roots.  The action pedigree is most evident in Marv, an unstoppable juggernaut who smashes through doors, bounces off of speeding cars, and rips people apart with his bare hands...a few bandages and pills later and he's fine.  Good guys and bad guys alike get shot so full of lead that they should be pencils, only to recover in the next scene. The men are all really nasty lugs and the women are all gorgeous and toned.<br /><br />The movie is filmed in all black and white, with splashes of color for good measure.  This achieves two amazing effects: it nails the feel of film noir and draws the viewer's eyes to important things about characters that might otherwise be missed.  For example, Dwight wears red sneakers, symbolic of having at least one foot dipped in blood from his murderous past.  The use of color, especially Yellow Bastard's...well, yellowishness, makes the character all the more disgusting. Color, when it appears, is as much a character as any actor on screen.<br /><br />The actors are suitably restrained.  If Sin City has a flaw, it's that it's too true to its roots at times, which might alienate modern audiences. Some of the characters have eye-rolling dialogue, but then, that's part of the mood of Sin City.  It's not meant to be realistic or even hip.  Sin City is true to itself, and it's up to the audience if they want to go along for the ride.<br /><br />This is the same kind of uncompromising vision that Peter Jackson brought to the screen with Lord of the Rings.  By deeply respecting the original creator's work, he shattered the preconceived notions of what a movie should be and conjures something we've never seen before.  I was skeptical about a comic book, even Miller's books, being turned into a new format, but Rodriguez did it and he did it with style.<br /><br />Sin City is dark, violent, and even sadistic at times.

B0007O38F8|3.0|I give this album 3 stars. I have to agree with most of the reviews in saying this album is not as good as get rich or die trying was.

B00005JNTV|5.0|Flexing its muscles in every explosive scene, Sin City is comprised of three stories, all centered on similar motif of the hero saving the damsel, in this hyper-realistic, other-worldly film, which I promise, with its intense imagery and in-your-face assured direction, will be unlike any movie journey you've ever taken. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owen all do terrific jobs as embattled heroes living in a nihilistic, sex-obsessed metropolis where violence rules the day the way it did back in the cowboy era. Indeed, the film has many qualities of a good western. Similar to the western genre, Sin City takes a look, often sardonic, of masculinity, the way it becomes exaggerated in such a world of chaos and danger. Mickey Rourke, with made-up commando chin and hawk nose, is the greatest send-up of hyper-masculinity I've ever seen. The plots, which center on evil officials, sociopathic killers, and damsels in distress, are familiar, but the film miracuously creates a world you've never stepped into before, succeeding grandly in recreating the seedy, imaginary dream-fest of the graphic comic novels written by Frank Miller.<br /><br />There is concern for some viewers about the violence and I am no fan of graphic brutality. While I'll concede that the blood flows freely in this film, the violence is so stylized that even someone like myself could handle it. Finally, let me add that the film has an ironic, campy feel that mitigates the violent impact somewhat.<br /><br />Is the film about anything other than the director's assured style as he captures the gritty world of a graphic comic novel? I say a resounding yes. The film does stand for a certain kind of courage and integrity that survives in a world of corruption, lies, and nihilism. The heroes and victims are at their core tender, soulful archetypes and not just stick figures.<br /><br />I think though that what stand out in the end is the original style, so assured and consistent throughout. This is a landmark film and I would bet that it will pave the way for a new age of graphic novels adapted to film.a landmark film and I would bet that it will pave the way for a new age of graphic novels adapted to film.

B00005KARC|5.0|You cannot go wrong with John Cusack.... <br /> <br />These are two of my favorite movies of the last ten years... <br /> <br />It isn't the writing which was excellent in both cases, but the casting.  You cannot go wrong with John Cusack.  The rest of the cast in both movies are just sublime.  Jerry Piven and Joan Cusack are wonderful, Jack Black blew up in his role in \\"High Fidelity\\".  However, the cream of the crop has got to be Dan Ackroyd.  I think his role in \\"Grosse Pointe Blank may have been the highlight of an excellent career. <br /> <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've heard in the past year or so. I heard Neighbourhood #2 the second song on the album on a radio show and immediately took a liking to the song and the bands sound. They don't sound like some other new bands that seem to be just a tweaked carbon copy of older bands. For example the reviewer who said its a crime to have arcade fire in the same sentence as Interpol. Don't get me wrong I think Interpol are a decent enough band but if your a fan of Joy divisision which I am, its hard not to see the similarities. Might aswell just throw on some Joy division. Whereas Arcade fire don't really sound like anyone else. The singer at times sounds a bit like the singer of Talking Heads, but don't let that put you off, I don't really like Talking Heads. If you like bands like the Strokes and the Killers you'll probably like this album. I got the Killers album at christmas and liked it alot but I've gotten a bit bored of it now to be honest. I think this album is better, it's a little less commercial and a little more heartwarming. Half of the album grabs you in the first few listens and the other half, (the less catchy songs) grow on you more after every listen. <br />I'm not going to go on about what songs are the best cause theres a lot. The only bad thing I can say about this album is that I think some of the songs could have been recorded and mixed a bit better. The vocals are quite queit in parts and the lyrics can be hard to make out especially if your listening to it at a low volume. Apart from that though this is a very good album.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers, a hot new band that has made its mark in the world of music, debuts with the ever catchy Hot Fuss. This is a supposed \\"rock\\" band, but that's a smidge to vague for what The Killers are. They are more of an alterna-pop, so to speak, so don't expect any head banging here. \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" the bands first single, had us jamming to their catchy synthesizer beats. This was a little misleading, at least to me. Gospels, (\\"All These Things That I've Done\\") porno soundiing music, (\\"Everything Will Be Alright\\") even some very questionable lyrics run through all the tracks, making this album a little racier than I expected. It's not bad, it's just that you really weren't expecting it. All the songs are original in their own respect, but it seems like they ran out of ideas toward the end of the CD. Still, this a great album for those who like alternative rock, indie rock, or even pop, Hot Fuss has something to offer to everyone. So buy this CD, it's definitely worth the money, and you're sure to enjoy it.
0743243315|4.0|This book came highly recommended to me by a friend, and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, \\"Brick Lane\\" tells the story of a Bangladeshi woman named Nanzeen who moves to London in an arranged marriage. After 10+ years of living life fairly uneventfully and raising her 2 young daughters, Nanzeen ultimately becomes involved romantically with another man, Karim, also of Bangladeshi descent. When Nanzeen's husband decides that the family should relocate back to Bangladesh, Nanzeen is forced to make a decision: follow her husband back to Bangladesh, or staying in London with Karim. Or is there a third option?<br /><br />Monica Ali takes her time developing the characters, which works well actually. Nevertheless somewhat distracting in my opinion is the side-story involving Nanzeen's sister who has remained in Bangladesh. It takes up quite a bit of the book but ultimately has really nothing to do with the resolution of Nanzeen's life choices.<br /><br />The book's inside cover points out that Ms. Ali herself is from Bangladesh and now lives in London. Obviously she knows what she is writing about, even though the circumstances of her move to London are presumably quite different from the fictional characters in the book. But it does beg the question what Ms. Ali will write about next, I mean, how many times can you approach the Bangladesh-to-London story? Meanwhile, \\"Brick Lane\\" is a very engaging book, and as highly recommended it came to me, I can now recommend it on to the next person.

078322608X|4.0|This is a very good film, but what made me enjoy it more was Brad Pitt's performance.  At the time I still wasn't sure how good an actor he is.  The acting from Ms. Stowe and Willis was also very good.  This movie is about going into the past to fix a horrible act of terrorism that makes it impossible to live on the surface of the earth because of a virus set loose by an environmentalist wacko.  There is a lot of action as Willis must go back and forth to the past to get to the right time.  A good film but Brad Pitt playing the crazy son of a billionaire who owns the company that made the virus makes this a more enjoyable movie.
B0007GAEGC|1.0|I was a Celtic Woman until July 2002. Unfortunately, I had to move upstate to Albany and they gave me the boot. My name is Sheena McDoogie, and be sure to look for my new record coming out in 2006  tenatively titled \\"Burning Bush - South of the Border.\\"
B00008YJH5|5.0|\\"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\\" and \\"Songs the Lord Taught Us\\" are close calls, but this may well be the best album of the 80s, and is certainly the best album of the 80s / 90s indie / alt rock scene. The Pixies work so well mainly due to the fact that their lyrics were often about nothing, but they are done in a style that they make you beleive they are much deeper than they actually are (a quality that makes most Dada art work so good). \\"Surfer Rosa\\" may not be the band's most accesable work (that is \\"Doolittle\\"), but it is by far their best, if only shown by repeated listenings. \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" is the best song of the 80s. Nirvana fans need apply.
B00006879E|1.0|This record is ok, but check out their debut record (\\"Magical Mystery Sexbus), it's the bomb!!!!!
B000003TAL|5.0|This is the masterpeice of the 80s alternative / indie rock scene right after the Pixies' \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and \\"Zen Arcade\\" by Husker Du. Sonically, it is an incredibly raw and distorted album, sort of like Velvet Underground and the Stooges combined. The most impressive thing about this album is, despite its massive length of seventy minutes, it all works incredibly well, and is never, ever boring. Stunning masterpeice, the pinnicle of Sonic Youth's career.
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|I can't believe Led Zeppelin was omitted. They did not sound up to their standards but it was better than nothing !!!
B000002LVB|5.0|After \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"The Chirping Crickets\\", this is the pop masterpeice to own. It works so well because Lou Reed realized he had to do a pop album, so he worked as hard as he could to still make it great - and he sure did a damn well good job at it. It's interesting to listen to the Velvet's first album, and hear how it signaled off what was to come. The garage rock of \\"I'm Waiting for the Man\\" and \\"Run Run Run\\" showed what was to come on \\"White Light / White Heat\\", the more melodic and soothing sounds of Nico's songs showed the compositions Lou Reed would format on the self-titled, and the more poppy and slightly psychadelic songs like \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"There She Goes Again\\" forshadowed what was to come on this album. If you liked those two songs, you'll like this album. Also, it always helps that the greatest song in the history of rock 'n' roll, \\"Sweet Jane\\" is on this album.
B000000W5N|5.0|Beggars, Let It Bleed, Sticky F and Exile establishes the Stones - regardless of any of their other output - as the Greatest Rock n Roll Band ever - so far. Beatles, Stones, Dylan - all are so sublime and groundbreaking that when I meet a true music fan if they select any of those three as the best ever, I can roll with it because it really is a matter of personal taste when r n r reaches this level. But, in the end, this 4-record run by the Stones is my favorite ever. Blues meets rock meets country meets attitude that only Mick and Keith have, and the absolute blind confidence that characterizes these records is astounding. It shows us all that when untethered by the business of music, and allowed to just express, r n r is really a defining artistic expression of it's time. And the Stones expressed sex, decadence, indulgence and mixed it with an intelligence and a wink and swagger that may never be matched.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|this album is brilliant, dark, sexy, rockin', melodic, broodin' and groovin'.  great cohesion of songs that make up the disc.  killer songwriting with excellent and varied production. \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" is incredible.

1573223085|5.0|Think about it.  We have nowhere else to go.<br /><br />Dan Pink is a visionary with the gift of being able to lay out his ideas in terms that everyone else can understand.  While this book will be scary for many, it serves as fair warning for those who are otherwise headed for a very unpleasant collision with reality.<br /><br />When I say \\"we have nowhere else to go,\\" I mean, as Americans, it is only by using our unique but highly undervalued (by most people, until now) innovation skills that we can even hope to maintain a high standard of living in the future.<br /><br />According to the writings of the man after whom the Pareto Principle was named, approximately 80% of any group that sees or hears about this book will abhor it, and the remaining 20% will embrace and exploit what they learn from it -- and profit along the way.<br /><br />Your future is up to you, far more than you may have realized up until now.

B000005HCM|5.0|This album is a must for anyone who likes jazz and good music in general. Lee Morgan gives the personality of his trumpet to the tracks and the sound of the album is so exciting. The track of the title is impressive, but the pearl of the album is Totem Pole.  <br /> <br />If you want to hit the mark buying a jazz album, this is your purchase. It won't dissapoint you, rather on the contrary, you'll think you should've never missed this.
B0000AQS6R|1.0|Well I am a big fan of the movie and I got it of christmas on VHS a long time ago.This christmas,I got the SE DVD along with CV2 and, The movie deserves 10 stars out of 5, but the SE DVD deserves NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The commentary is AWFUL, because not only is Chevy chase not in it, but Beverly will not shut the f--k up about her hair and boobs, Quaid has a LOT to say, Miriam Flynn keeps on bragging about how big she is and everyone keeps on interrupting each other- VERY RUDE.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed is that the ornament that comes with the DVD-It's GARBAGE. It's made of styrofoam- easy to break and we threw it away. Oh, and also that on both DVD's on the back there is a shot of the Griswalds with their tree by there owner. In the movie, it dosent include that.<br /><br />So I will write a positive review when something SPECIAL of the movie will come out.

B0000026UV|5.0|One of the problems which frequently occurs when guitar virtuosos get together is that they get too interested in demonstrating their virtuosity and forget about the music. That doesn't happen here.  Atkins and Knopfler are both masters of understated guitar licks.  Listen to this CD with only one ear and you might not realize you're hearing two of the best guitar players in the world.<br /><br />Well, when you hear \\"Neck and Neck\\" you won't jump and shout and play air guitar. But \\"There'll be Some Changes Made\\" will get your toes tapping as Chet contemplates becoming a rock star and Mark discourages him. (\\"The groupie girls aren't that good...or at least some of them aren't\\")  \\"The Next Time I'm in Town\\" is another toe-tapper that features Vince Gill's clear tenor voice in harmony with Knopfler and superb steel guitar played by Paul Franklin.  I also like the instrumental version of Patsy Cline's \\"Sweet Dreams.\\" \\"Poor Boy Blues\\" if I recall correctly won a Grammy for Atkins/Knopfler.<br /><br />If you're seeking a flamboyant rock album this is not for you, but for back-porch finger-picking and singing it can't be beat.<br /><br />Smallchief
0790749815|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock is the director just that alone is enough to see this movie. Not to mention Cary Grant and Eva Marie St. are the stars of this film. The plot is suspensful and you will sure to be on the edge of your seat within the first 15 minutes of this movie. Cary Grant plays a man who is mistaken for someone else that some people want dead. And you can't really tell what Eva Marie St. is. Anyone who sees this movie will sure to fall in love with it. Even though I think they miscast Cary's mother in this movie (she should be older!). A little trivia due to censors during that time Eva had to dub her own voice during one line. On the train while having lunch (or dinner) when they first meet Eva says, \\"I never discuss love on an empty stomach.\\" When the line was actually, \\"I never make love on an empty stomach.\\" Watch her lips and you can see it.
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is one of my all-time favorite writers and I always rejoice when the latest New Yorker includes one of his articles.  Tipping Point focused on the way critical mass influences everything from crime statistics to footwear choices.  Blink directs our attention (paradoxically) to unconscious thought processes.<br /><br />As always, Gladwell relies on findings from mainstream research to make his points. He cites psychologists whose work belongs on syllabuses of graduate seminars.  Unfortunately, that's where most of their work ends up, when in fact there are enormous implications for all parts of our lives.<br /><br />Blink begins by noting that often we need only small \\"thin slices\\" of information to make predictions about behavior and events. For instance, psychologist Gottman can predict whether a couple will divorce after listening to only a few minutes of dialogue.  Researchers Levinson and Ambady found that they could predict a doctor's likelihood of being sued not from his technical skills, but from an analysis of his personality - based on a \\"thin slice\\" of videotape.<br /><br />Gladwell also addresses the \\"dark side\\" of thin slicing, namely stereotyping.  Because President Warren G. Harding was elected because he looked handsomely presidential, Gladwell refers to the \\"Harding effect,\\" bad judgment associated with thin slices.<br /><br />On the other hand, sometimes a thin slice can be more accurate than a larger picture: judges of jam became less accurate when asked to describe why they favored one brand over another.<br /><br />And conversely, sometimes thin slices are inadequate to make judgments. Police officers, for instance, perform more responsibly if they're forced to slow down, so a one-officer car actually becomes safer: the officer has to wait for backup.  A new music sound fails the market research test, but listeners love the sound when they hear a whole concert.<br /><br />Some reviews have been critical because Gladwell seems to be saying, \\"Sometimes snap judgments work...and sometimes they don't. So what?\\"<br /><br />However, what Gladwell does is identify specific situations when think slices predict behavior - although the behavior predicted may not be reasoned or even desirable.  It's a little scary to think that students who observe ten minutes of a class will make predictions that correlate with student evaluations for an entire term or that ten minutes of observing a doctor will predict his liability for lawsuits.<br /><br />The real problem seems to be that the more thorough, reason-based evaluations may also derive from single cues  - not thoughtful integration of multiple insights. In fact, we may not be capable to moving beyond thin slices.<br /><br />We read thin slices accurately when we have expertise. Thus Thomas Hoving and other art experts detected a fraud from the \\"feel\\" of a piece.  A firefighter knows when it's time to clear out a building. As a career coach I find that clients with lots of corporate experience can read a job interview easily - but they can't trust their insights as they consider a new career field or a business.<br /><br />In fact, recent televised reports of trials show how jurors rely on cues that they interpret through the lens of \\"common sense,\\" not realizing that common sense often conflicts with scientific findings.  One juror claimed, \\"Scott Peterson didn't look sorrowful enough,\\" yet in fact researchers find a wide variety of \\"normal\\" ways of expressing grief.  In a trial of a doctor accused of poisoning his wife, a juror dismissed an expert's theory that the victim died of a heart attack because \\"there was no history.\\" Yet for many heart attack victims, the first symptom is a fatal heart attack.  I can't help wondering if jurors interpret \\"different\\" as \\"bad,\\" just as ordinary people reject unfamiliar music.<br /><br />This book reads as entertainingly as any novel. Many of us will have \\"aha\\" moments, as we learn, for instance, why more women have been accepted into classical orchestras. But ultimately, it is easy to feel frustrated by the gap between scientific knowledge and the realms of marketing, justice, education and other systems.<br /><br />We know why Mary Tyler Moore and All in the Family came close to being denied an audience - yet a promising young musician faces the same system with a less happy outcome.  We realize that people cannot predict how their own minds will function - yet judges routinely ask prospective jurors about bias.<br /><br />These beliefs are no different than those of orchestra conductors who say, \\"Women don't have powerful lungs,\\" yet we continue to confuse common sense - the Harding fallacy - with real knowledge.<br /><br />Blink is the kind of book that should be read, talked about, analyzed, and discussed widely. I wish I could be more hopeful about the ability of scientific findings to change the way we live and conduct the business of society.earn, for instance, why more women have been accepted into classical orchestras.

B000002HPV|5.0|This is my favourite Bjork album, in fact my favourite album. After 1993's \\"Debut\\" album, which was shy, and not to weird, and quite accesible, and 1995's \\"Post\\", which too, could be considered as mainstream music, hence her \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" song, and two years later, Bjork released a very abstract and original album, without a dull track!<br />Hunter starts the album off. This song REALLY needs to grow on you. It's military beats haven't been heard on a \\"normal\\" CD before. It's very icelandic. 9/10. Following, is the maginficent \\"Joga\\" - a ballad, which is also very icelandic, it uses Icelandic volcanoes and loopes them, in the last and very complex verse, and the violins are very good also. 10/10 Unravel is my least favourite on Homogenic - it is too simplistic and quite boring, it may grow on me though. 7.5/10 Next, is a song called \\"Bachelorette\\" - it has all the elements that make it a good song which I live, but for some reason, I just don't find it as captivating as Joga, or the later tracks, it is till good although Bjork didn't write it, as she did to all of her other songs on this CD. 9/10. \\"All Neon Like\\" is next. It is my favourite. It starts out as boring and balladic as Unravel, but when it gets up to around 1:20, a fantastic loop comes in, which gives the album some bass, and originality. All of the rythms after this 1:20 mark are very synocopated, and give the song a weird feel. 10/10. Track 6 is \\"5 Years\\" -- this again uses volcanoes, but I can't really explain this song right now. 9/10. \\"Immature\\" is a very underrated song in my opinion. I live it's gradual build-up, and Bjork's swing-like vocals. It is my second favourite track on the album. \\"Alarm Call\\", is also very good. I thought the  video / radio version was rather 9/10ish, but the album version is far better. This song, similarly to Immature, uses a gradual build up to. This is my third favourite Bjork song. 10/10. \\"Pluto\\" followes, and it very outerspace-like (hence the name), and is extremel fast. 8.5/10. The final track won 2 MTV VMA's (you must see the video - it is fantasic!) and although I like the video version over this, one it is still very good. 10/10<br />This album.....<br />Peaked at #4 in the UK (4-13-24-40-60-73 RE: 40-67 RE: 74 RE: 67 RE: 72 RE: 69-68)<br /><br />Peaked at #28 in the USA (28-49-60-71-77-117-145-164-196)<br /><br />Peaked at #6 in Australia<br />And went Gold in the US!!!<br /><br />And therefore, if for some odd reason, you only want to purchase 1 Bjork CD in your lifetime, get this one. I have madew a chart below, stating how many Bjork CDs you wish to purchase, and the order you shoud get them in::<br />1 - Homogenic<br />2 - Post, Homogenic<br />3 - Post, Homogenic, Vespertine<br />4 - Post, Homogenic, Vespertine, Medulla<br />5 - Debut, Post, Homogenic, Vespertine, Medulla<br /><br />Note:: I accidently write another review for this album 2 months later. Here it is.....<br /><br />Let me start by just saying that this album has just missed out on being my favourite CD ever. To me, Tori Amos' Boys For Pele is the ultimate, it is the only CD (including singles) that I own witout a dull track, which is very ironic, because it is the longest CD I own track-wise. Well anyway, you will have an incredible experience with this album, whether you like it or not .<br />Homogenic begins with Hunter. It's soft military beats open the song and tell you without words that the following hour will like nothing you have ever experienced, ever. Track II, Joga can be my favourite song only if I am in the right mood. It is a ballad with violins so I have to be in a relaxed, positive, balladic mood, and like in every other Bjork song anti-social - for odvious reasons. The third song's simplicity lets it down. Unravel is far from the best song here, but stll very very good. Bachelorette is quite accessible compared to the other tracks, athough the song isn't my favourite from Bjork, an outstanding video accompany's it, which makes upfor my disapointments in ths song. This song is often the fans favoutite but for some odd reason, I just don't feel very 'moved' by this song like I do with her others, although it is her highest selling single from this album, peaking at #24 in the UK and selling well around Europe.<br />'All Neon Like' is great, one of my favourites from this album. I like how it starts out so boring and simplistic (in a good way), and than gets so bassey, although note that it is very inaccessible, which is also meant in a good way. 5 Years continues Homgenic in a very good style and is followed by another of my three favourites Immature. I cannot understand why people do not like this song. It creates a mood similar to the one All Neon Like creates, athough I think I like this song better - it is more relazed and calm. I never really took much interest to the radio/video version of Alarm Call - it was way to accessible compared to practically everything else she has released. This album version is far better. It doesn't peak at the beginning and more media are are added throughout the song, so it peaks close to the end. This song is another of my favourites. Pluto is also very good, but follwed by an even better track - it is the fifth single and is titled All Is Full Of Love. It is the most laid-back and creative song Bjork has made, which makes it one of the fans favourites.<br />So to conclude, I can't recommend this album strongly enough to anyone who is looking for something different., original and unique. It went Gold i the UK and US and sold over 1 million copies worldwide.some odd reason, I just don't feel very 'moved' by this song like I do with her others, although it is her highest selling single from this album, peaking at #24 in the UK and selling well around Europe.

6304936303|3.0|I normally like Bruce Willis, but he's hot on the cover of this movie. Despite not being too keen on watching the movie, it was funny, and packed with one-liners. It also has a very young Danielle Harris, also known for getting killed off in Urban Legend. Personally I can't tell the difference between the Wayan brothers.<br /><br />There's nothing special about this movie. Bruce Willis plays a cynical wise-ass 'private detective', who smokes, drinks, and has a daughter and a wife who don't really like him. There's a young rookie, who's an ex-basketball player. A very unrecognisable Halle Berry doesn't do much for the film, and ends up getting shot.<br /><br />The film has dated surprisingly well, considering it was released in 1991, although Brucie has aged considerably! Danielle Harris is surprisingly good, having to throw insults & swear lots at Brucie's character, and later in the movie, gets a gun to her head.<br /><br />There's not a great deal of extras on this, as you can imagine, there's five other trailers though.<br /><br />This is a good movie, although it would be nice if Brucie cracked a smile once in a while. I'm still not keen on the Bruce/Damon Wayans pairing. It just didn't seem right.

B00008EY65|3.0|Something told me this movie could have been better. I enjoyed the movie, but I found most of it instantly forgettable, and I could barely follow what little plot there was, thinking that Hellboy ATE cats, instead of just being partial to them. And why didn't Liz want to come back to where everyone else was? And the Spear Of Destiny, most recently seen in Constantine, and subject of a lot of discussion as to whether it did kill Christ or not, appears, although briefly.<br /><br />However, I did love Ron Perlman - who shares the same birthday as me. I hadn't previously heard of him, but his dry sarcasm puts him in the same league as Bill Murray in my opinion. He was definitely cute as Hellboy, and the sarcasm was spot on. However, having seen him a photo of him without the Hellboy makeup on (which took four hours to apply), OMG, is it the same guy?! To prepare for his role, Ron read all the Hellboy comics and worked out three hours a day, five to seven days a week (varies). He also worked out while shooting, every day he had off from filming, he would workout. He also broke a rib while filming, after jumping onto a train that was coming towards him at about 45 mph. Very early on in the film's preproduction, the filmmakers considered putting Hellboy's giant stone hand on his left arm rather than the right, so as to grant the actor playing Hellboy the full use of his right hand. Ron Perlman turned out to be left-handed, so the filmmakers were able to preserve the Right Hand of Doom.<br /><br />There are no opening credits save the 3-D title, which is flown over several times by the camera before it pulls back to reveal the full title. During the closing credits there's a brief shot of Dr. Manning still trying to contact someone on his team and getting nothing in response. A shadow of a Sammael passes in the background as the scene fades back to credits.<br /><br />Both Mike Mignola and Guillermo del Toro have cameos in this. Mike, Hellboy's creator appears dressed as a knight in a crowd of costumed people menaced by Sammael.

B000002AZ8|5.0|I'm torn between 4.5 and 5 stars on this album.  It has one of the weirdest songs I've ever heard(\\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\") which also happens to be one of my favorites on the album.  Of course, the song that comes before it(\\"Immortality\\") is the best on the album, and one of the best songs ever, and \\"Cordoroy\\" is also up there.  The album opens up with a little jazzy intro that leads into \\"Last Exit\\" and 3 more great rockers before the beautiful \\"Nothingman\\".  After this, we hear \\"Whipping\\", a semi-pro-choice anthem(not a cause I believe in, but it's a great song anyway), and then the albums first more out-there track, \\"Pry, To\\".  \\"P-R-I-V-A-C-Y it's privacy\\".  I think that's how it goes.  Then we hear the aforementioned sing-along \\"Cordoroy\\"(although the words are somewhat hard to understand, it just makes you wanna sing along).  After this, we get the band's quirkiest song, \\"Bugs\\", and accordion laden song about, you guessed it, bugs.  Now you'll hear a great rocker, \\"Satan's Bed\\" and then a song you all know, \\"Betterman\\".  Next you'll hear \\"Aye Davinita\\", a song in the vein of \\"Pry, To\\", and \\"Immortality\\", a beautiful ballad with an awesome guitar solo that's only made better in concert.  Some people consider \\"Immortality\\" the album's final song because it seems like one more than the real closer(plus they like it a lot more), \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\\".  That song, in my opinion, kicks goddamn ass.  Just creepy awesomeness in song form.  The bands most experimental song fittingly ends the band's most experimental album. <br /> <br />Rating: 4.5/5
B00005JNEW|3.0|I have difficulty in understanding why they made this true melodrama into a movie.  I was greatly disappointed.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|Cruchy. Thats all you can really say to describe this album, all the songs are driving and crunchy. The good kind of crunch, the kind of crunch that reminds me of classic ZZ Top. So, i say take ZZ Top, take out the 80's ness, throw in some 90's alternative ness, and riase the vocals an octive or two on about half the songs.  <br /> <br />This is a fantastic collection of straigh up rock songs. If you liked oldschool queens, then yeah, this is a bit more mellow and creapy, but still just as good. Josh Homme has refined both his guitfiddle and pipes so well that he just dominates this album. Joey Castillio also destroys these songs with monsterous drum parts that fit the song perfectly.  <br /> <br /> <br />Its a badass album, thats all ya need to know
0800177363|5.0|A moving masterpiece that shows that Miracles still exist.  A <br />wonderful true story with giant stars (Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro) filling giant shoes.  Both who deserved oscars for their powerful roles.  Load up on the kleenex.  I certainly could watch this film over and over again.
B00005LMBK|5.0|yo this album is kick ass though i don't know why they put a parental advisory thing on it they only cuss on two songs and theres nothing nasty on the case or booklet or enhanced bonus they it really only cuts sales cause \\"the man\\" dosen't think you should listen ((god that line sucks)) the thing is that the album was really good and i really liked \\"5/4\\" \\"re-hash\\" \\"left handed suzuki method\\" who wouldn't like them (even though the band isn't real) they are cool so why not buy the c.d. plus for you kiddies don't get your parents intemidated by the parental sign just blast the c.d. on and all you hear first song only says f*** two times then on the last it only says a** two times as well so don't be afraid ^_^ ^_^
B0007CNXUU|5.0|Only a week ago, I watched HOOK, and although it was a well done film, I've never been a real PETER PAN fan, so it was with some hesitance that I decided to view FINDING NEVERLAND.  But this wonderful and brilliant film is not so much about how J. M. Barrie came to create Peter Pan, but the story of relationships touched by love, admiration and most importantly imagination.  Barrie was Peter Pan, a grown man who still wanted to be a little boy.  As embodied by the amazingly versatile Johnny Depp, J.M. Barrie becomes a symbol of that youthful innocence we all would love to maintain.  It is a deeply realized, thoughtful and outstanding addition to the amazing repertoire of characters Depp has given us in the past few years.  For once, Depp doesn't look like the eternal teenager, using his dark good looks more as an adult than any film he's done, ironic in that his character still wants to be a boy. Depp never allows his character to sink into predictable maudlin behavior with the Davises; he maintains an honest, forthright position with them and his social climbing wife as well.  In finally taking Sylvia to Neverland, in a heart-rending finale, Depp shows us the depth of his performance.  Kate Winslet continues her chameleonic talents in the role of Sylvia; her every movement, gesture and dialogue carries the weight of a woman who has lost her husband and is facing her own imminent death.  Never self-effacing, or mawkish, Winslet's performance is a glowing one, and when she goes to neverland, it is a three hanky moment.  Freddie Highmore as the young Peter, a little boy who seems to be growing up too fast, is devastatingly brilliant.  A cute Haley Joel Osment clone, Highmore brings such depth and believability to this role, he is amazing, and should have garnered a Best Supporting Actor nomination and win, for this beautifully performed role.  The scene in which he asks Depp why his Mommy had to die is heartbreaking and beautiful.  Director Mark Forster rounds out his cast with marvelous performances from the rest of the little boys; Julie Christie brings a depth to a cliche role as the rather diabolical mother of Winslet, but as we get to know her better, we can see where her motherly love is taking her.  Christie hasn't had a role this good in years; and of course, the superb Dustin Hoffman gives us a remarkably understated performance as the producer who funds Barrie's plays, and his moment of amazement when he realizes Peter Pan is going to be successful is typical Hoffman brilliance.  Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, Open Water) gives a marvelously restrained performance as Barrie's wife, whose reverence for social climbing ultimately results in the destruction of their marriage; it isn't really Barrie's spending time with the Davises, but the fact that the two were mismatched from the beginning that separates them.<br /><br />FINDING NEVERLAND is one of my favorite films I've viewed in the past year, and its Oscar nominations were richly deserved.  Johnny Depp would have stood a good chance of winning Best Actor had it not been the same year as Jamie Foxx's brilliant Ray Charles.  But Depp has range and endurance and I know one day he's going to be up at the podium, and deservedly so.  Don't let the movie's \\"quietness\\" keep you from viewing it.  It is vastly entertaining and really what moviemaking is all about.cast with marvelous performances from the rest of the little boys; Julie Christie brings a depth to a cliche role as the rather diabolical mother of Winslet, but as we get to know her better, we can see where her motherly love is taking her.

0440180295|2.0|This was the most anti-human book that I've read since Gulliver's Travels. Vonnegut's cynicism and apathy are understandable considering the atrocities that he witnessed during the war, and I imagine writing the book was a cathartic experience for him, but other than that, there's not much to be gained from this novel.  <br /> <br />Vonnegut's shell-shocked brain appears incapable of distinguishing between the Germans who were injecting dye into women's and children's eyes and rendering them into soap and candles and the Allied soldiers that sacrificed their lives trying to stop them.  <br /> <br />His main points seem to be: <br />1. War is stupid. <br />2. People are stupid. <br />3. Life is meaningless. <br />4. There's nothing any of us can do about it. <br />5. So, try not to think about the bad things in your life and just think happy thoughts. <br /> <br />If this is your life's philosophy, you will also consider this a \\"brilliant\\" work.
B000005RFQ|5.0|\\"Born Again\\" was released during the summer of 1983.  This album features Ian Gillan on vocals, as he replaces the recently departed Ronnie James Dio (who left to front his own band). Sabbath is once again competing with former frontmen. How do they do? Here are my reviews of the songs based out of 5 *****:<br /><br />\\"Trashed\\" - Should have been named \\"Thrashed\\" because this song does just that! Might be the hardest/fastest tune Sabbath ever did! Some SUPER HEAVY bass from Gzr and uber rifing from Iommi open the song. Ian then bursts in with a piercing screech and off we go at warp speed! A song about driving drunk at night and at high speed (rock-n-roll tales!) Iommi lays down a BLISTERING solo! DAMN this song F'n KILLS! Ends with some more gutteral Gillan howls and another scorching Iommi solo. A metal masterpiece! Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Stonehenge\\" - Opens with moody, spacey synth effects (ala \\"5150\\" from \\"Mob Rules\\")leading directly into:<br />\\"Disturbing The Priest\\" - a wicked \\"laugh\\" from Ian and awesome melody from Iommi opens this metal gem. Very heavy bass (as usual from Gzr) and drumming from Ward. A song that changes tempo from a \\"Heaven & Hell\\" groove into a midtempo sludge fest. Ian sings his heart out! Gillan sounds GREAT! Intelligent and thought provoking lyrics really help to make the song a metal classic. Ends with some of the most evil screams/laughs from Ian you will EVER hear!  F'N A this song RULES!  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"The Dark\\" - Wierd synth sound effects begin this tune as a hypnotic guitar and  synthesizer work their way directly into:<br />\\"Zero The Hero\\" - The G-N-R song \\"Paradise City\\" ripped off the melody from this tune. A repeating guitar riff sounds throughout the whole song.  The tempo is slow and chunky.  Guitar solo is amazing (would sound right at home in any of the Dio Sabbath albums). Cool, deep \\"bell\\" gonging help to color the tune. The lyrics are intelligent and thoughtful.  The whole tone of this song is very heavy and eerie. A very underrated Sabbath song.  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Digital Bitch\\" - Song opens with Iommi riffing and laying down a BLAZING solo.  The tempo is very fast and furious.  Great bass playing from Gzr.  Iommi throws in quick solos at every opportunity.  The lyrics are sort of sophomoric, BUT WHO CARES!  This song also destroys!  Another underrated Sabbath tune from Gillan and Sabbath! Great howls from Ian and killer solos from Iommi.  What more do you need? NOTHING!  Awesome!  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Born Again\\" - Some heavily distorted sounding bass work from Gzr opens this \\"ballad\\" from the Sabb.  Ian sings with alot of emotion and heart.  He sings his heart out! The tempo and \\"heaviness\\" pick up for the chorus.  Ian puts down some HIGH pitched screams! Some thought producing lyrics \\"At the hearts of mutant gods who think we're all the same.  They're controlling our minds. And they use us for fame and fortune.\\"  Can't argue with that!  Great solo by Iommi ends this magnificent piece.  Rating - ****<br /><br />\\"Hot Line\\" - Heavy bass and guitar open the song. Sammy Hagarish guitar riff ala \\"There's Only One Way To Rock\\" stamps the melody of this tune.  Ian sings tremendously and Iommi AGAIN puts down on wax some fantastic/burning solos!  I really like this song (even with the inane lyrics).  Rating - ****<br /><br />\\"Keep It Warm\\" -  Thick/chunky bass from Gzr and heavy riffs from Iommi opens this piece which turns kind of \\"popish\\" during the chorus. This song souds like it was made for radio.  Geezer sounds great and Iommi (I KNOW I'm repeating myself here, but he AGAIN has a balls out solo that kills!)  The tempo picks up during Iommi's solo but returns to the original melody/tempo for the end.  I like this one 2 (doofy lyrics make it lose a star)! Rating - ****<br /><br />Bill Ward left after the recording of this album for health reasons.  He was replaced by Bev Bevans of ELO fame for the tour (who would have thunk it?). Iommi and Sabbath released one of the best albums of 1983. Unfortunately, Ian Gillan left after the tour to regroup with Deep Purple, and Iommi was once again without a frontman. Ian would never record again with Sabbath, which is a real shame because this is without a doubt, one of the BEST records Ian has ever done. This album is a metal classic and should be proudly remembered and recognized as a masterpiece by Sabbath.  GET THIS ONE NOW!fter the tour to regroup with Deep Purple, and Iommi was once again without a frontman.

B000002HRE|4.0|Ok, sure, it's not typical Metallica. I understand that. Like everyone I know, I hated Load. But the problem I see with a lot of people is that they bunch Reload in with Load just because they were recorded at the same time. The fact is, Reload is a lot more typical of Metallica than Load was. People think it's not because it's connected to Load but dig deeper.    1. Fuel - ***** - This song really is great. It's their best song of the post-Black Album era. It has all of Metallica's early heavy metal guitar riffs and Hetfield's trademark growl is back for this song, something that was lost in Load. There's no slowing down in it. It's an adrenaline filled thriller of a song. Since they made it, Metallica has always used to open shows. Why? It gets the fan pumped up. It gets me pumped up as I'm listening to it writing this review. Awesome song. However, the lyrics and and even the riffs are sort of taken from \\"Motorbreath\\" from Kill 'Em All.    2. The Memory Remains - **** - This song is pretty good. It's nothing ground breaking and spectacular like Fuel but it is good. The lyrics are pretty inspired actually. Think about it, adding Marianne Faithful, as bad as her parts were, really was inspired because this song really speaks volumes about where she's gone. Big star, dating Mick Jagger, to a washed up has-been whose biggest work in years was on a Metallica album of all places. The problem with this song that earns it just three stars is what I like about it. Marianne Faithful, as I said, was an inspired idea to add because she's the living epitomy of who they're singing about. But that doesn't make her parts any better. Frankly, she sounds like a cat in heat. That's not a good thing. Then, I have to admit, the song is a little slow. It does have some good heavy metal riffs but it's slowness and Marianne Faithful bog this song down to three stars.    3. Devil's Dance - ** - This song is heavier than what they did on Load. What turns me off about it is that it's a little slow and the production is just awful. When James says \\"Let's dance\\" you can barely hear him. The lyrics are also pretty uninspired. The guitar riffs are the best thing about this song. This is also pretty much a rip-off of \\"Jump In The Fire\\" from Kill 'Em All as far as the lyrics.    4. The Unforgiven II - **** - This song is just too heavily country influenced. The first Unforgiven was a heavy metal ballad with an awesome improvised solo. This one is still good but, like I said, has too much of a country influence. I have to say though, the lyrics are pretty good. Just like the first Unforgiven, it tells a pretty powerful story. This man, the same one from The Unforgiven, meets a woman that's similar to him but in the end, she's unforgiven II. Bad pun, I know, but hey, it's in the song and the song is pretty good.    5. Better Than You - ***** - Another five star song! This one is just plain awesome. This is the only song, along with Fuel, of the post-Black Album era that can compare to their early work. The chorus slows a bit but it's still pretty powerful. The whole song is filled with heavy metal riffs. I love the solos in it. It's two awesome solos and the chorus is great. As I said, the chorus slows down but I love how the lyrics reach that point and James hits the chorus and just strides into crying out the words \\"Better than you!\\". The lyrics are also pretty good. If you've ever felt held back in your life, if you've ever felt a little like Dilbert, then this is the song for you. Whenever I feel held back at anything, this song is just awesome to listen to. I can really connect to the lyrics. Also, at the beginning of this song, Lars isn't too bad on the drums. The whole song is really great and underrated.    6. Slither - *** - I've listened to this song a lot more. The lyrics still suck but the riffs are good enough to warrant it a three star rating.    7. Carpe Diem Baby - *** - This song is a little slow but the beat and riffs are really cool. By nomeans, is this anywhere near 80's Metallica. However, the lyrics are pretty good. It also speaks volumes for how James has lived his life. He literally jumped in the fire, the reason for the tattoo that inspired this song. Overall, it's not above average, but it's still worth listening to and it's better than half the stuff on Load.    8. Bad Seed - ** - This song has another cool beat. The lyrics are a bit like Slither in that they seem uninspired and filler but this song is actually good filler. It has a good chorus. Definitely worth listening to occasionally.    9. Where The Wild Things Are - * - Awful. What was Metallica thinking? Should've been on Load instead. Really uninspired    10. Prince Charming - ***** - This song is AWESOME. I love this song. It's at least 5 stars. My favorite song on the album.    11. Low Man's Lyric - *** - I know what you're thinking. How could this be any good? It's an Irish folk song! What was Metallica thinking? I admit, this isn't metal and has little place on an album by a band called METALlica. But this is actually pretty good if you get past that. The beat is good, the melody is awesome, and James isn't bad at all on the vocals. This isn't a metal song per se but it is a good song despite that. It's got good lyrics and it's a nice song. It's nothing to thrash to but do we really want to thrash and headbang constantly? I like nice intervels of sweet melodies such as this. If I didn't appreciate slow, melodic, ballads too, my head would probably have fallen off by now.    12. Attitude - **** - A good headbanging song. Not as good as Better Than You or Fuel but it's almost as good. Awesome riffs and beat.    13. Fixxxer - **** - A nice ender with powerful lyrics and good guitar riffs.    Overall:    1. *****  2. ****  3. **  4. ****  5. *****  6. ***  7. ***  8. **  9. *  10. *****  11. ***  12. ****  13. ****    Three 5 star songs, four 4 star songs, three 3 star songs, two 2 star song, one 1 star song. Overall, that's not really that bad. 5 out of 13 songs that are worth listening to and 7 that are required listening for Metallica fans. That's pretty good compared to the abysmal results of Load. Reload is not, I repeat, NOT, Master of Puppets or Ride The Lightning. But it gets too bad a rap. This album is pretty good overall and if you like old Metallica, I definitely suggest picking it up for Fuel, The Memory Remains, The Unforgiven II, Better Than You, Prince Charming, Attitude, and Fixxxer or at least buying them on your I-Pod. I can't say as much for Load but Reload is definitely worth putting on your shopping list if your a Metallica fan. It's not your typical Metallica but it's a lot better than any of their other post-Black Album studio offerings that were originally written and produced by them. In the end, I'd say buy it. If you don't like it, you can always sell it to a used CD store or somewhere else. Or, if you really hate it, you can use it as a coaster. But if you liked the old Metallica like me, I really do think you'll be able to see merit in this CD.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This film is not so much based-on Robert Heinlein's novel of the same name as it is a scathing satire of the book. Writer Ed Neumeier and director Paul Verhoeven suggest, not too subtly, that military societies are inevitably fascist in nature. Little time is overtly devoted to politics and philosophy, though, in a fast paced war movie pitting our young, good looking heros against nasty CG bugs.<br /><br />Stylistically, the film is based on Hollywood war propaganda films of the early 1940s, like Frank Capra's Why We Fight and of every gung-ho war film John Wayne ever made, but in the same over-the-top style Neumeier and Verhoeven brought to RoboCop. In one scene, a dying infantrywoman says \\"I'm dying, Johnny! Dying!\\" with all the melodrama of a scene out of Back to Bataan. The short, military PR clip of soldiers showing their weapons to a class of fourth-graders, letting the kids handle their machine guns, and handing out shells to the kids is laugh-out-loud funny, in an uneasy kind of way. In fact, if this film has a flaw it is that many viewers will be uneasy with its unapologetic, take-no-prisoners satire in what is otherwise a sci-fi action-adventure movie. The squeamish should also be warned that in true Verhoeven style, the film is often gratuitously violent and gross. But if you're willing to take a healthy dose of social and political satire along with a war against giant digital bugs, Starship Troopers is a brilliant movie.<br /><br />Oh, and if you were hoping for a faithful adaptation of Heinlein's work -- forget it. Neumeier clearly does think much of Heinlein's vision of a military run society and in the DVD commentary, Verhoeven reveals that the bounce suits were left out because he didn't know if the digital effects were sophisticated enough to pull them off and he admits that he never read the book.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album amazes me and Green Day seem to keep getting better. I have been a fan of theirs for years and I have to say this is by far their best album and I love them all. It has such musicianship and diversity which sets it apart from many other albums that have been released this year. The fact that every song sounds good and that none of the songs have a repiticious sound to them makes this albuma must buy. I, for one hate when every song on an album sounds the same, but with this album does not fall into that trap. As long as Green Day is around, they will be a great band because they are doing everything right! All the songs are great but pay special attention to Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Holiday, Jesus of Surburbia, Wake Me Up When September Ends, and Whatshername. These are just a few of the brilliant songs on this album. No song should be overlooked because they are all good enough to be released as singles.  <br /> <br />P.S Whats all this talk saying that they copied Simple Plan songs? Green Day have been around much longer than Simple Plan and thus cannot be compared to them. Also, Simple Plan loves Green Day (Haven't you ever noticed the American idiot sticker on the guitarists guitar?)

He is a true example of a man who was born to write. In his \\"Memoir of the Craft\\", King takes us inside his childhood and shows us how his style was formed. There are a few stories from when he was young that have nothing to do with writing at all. They seem to be there as an entertaining setup of his personality and for that, they function well. (Readers susceptible to queasiness might hiccup a breakfast bubble at the long-needle/inner ear story.)<br /><br />Most precious of memories is when his mother praised him for his first short story and encouraged him along. I'm sure many writers will relate to the heartfelt scene.<br /><br />As he gets older and finds that he truly loves to write, King begins to submit his stories to magazines and takes great pleasure in the personalized rejection letters he receives. There are many great descriptions of his successes and failures as he works his way up to his premiere novel, Carrie.<br /><br />The second part of the book is the actual meat where King brings what he really came here to discuss: how to write. He uses a toolbox metaphor to help explain what every writer needs. He is very direct about his personal writing peeves and shows a genuine interest in helping new and seasoned writers alike.<br /><br />In the third and final part of On Writing, King revisits his own horror of being hit by a runaway van in 1999--an event that interrupted his work on this very book! He describes the time of his suffering in a way that puts the reader there at the scene of the accident as well as putting the reader beside him during his physical recovery.<br /><br />King repeatedly hammers the point home that a real writer must constantly be reading and (duh) writing. We hear this all the time from writers and teachers alike, and King makes no bones about it here.<br /><br />As a writer myself, and as a rabid Stephen King fan, I thoroughly enjoyed his many anectdotes and advices. All my life, I've been riding shotgun in Mr. King's wild ride. I've always considered him as a kind of mysterious and phantom-like entity behind the words. Here, he shows his humanity in his love for his wife Tabitha (his Ideal Reader) and his kids. He speaks of writing as something that he cannot fully explain, though he explains it rather well. He offers the viewpoint that all great and humble writers share: that he is used as a vessel for some unknown and beautiful force of the universe.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is when King describes the intense connection between writer and reader. The way in which he describes how writing transcends time and place in order to reach any and all readers is piercing in its raw truthfulness. His honest and un-flinching approach to the teaching of the craft is as wonderful and meaningful as his stories.<br /><br />Long live the master.kes no bones about it here.

6305181810|5.0|I wasn't expecting much when I dropped this 1998 movie into the DVD player...<br /><br />There is a lot to commend itself. Matt Damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam! Danny Devito is slimy, shady, sarcastic, and sleazy (in other words, perfect Devito) as Damon's partner.<br /><br />The main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia. The sleazy Big Insurance Company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter. They bet wrong! Our hero, guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge (Dixon from Alias), come to the rescue.<br /><br />The pieces fit together quite nicely. Justice is served, bad guys are taken down, and Matt Damon establishes himself as an unlikely, unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with this story or this film. Very delightful and satisfying in every respect.
0312263120|3.0|I like Dan Brown's books,but I disagree about the image of Spain that is shown in the book. <br />On the other hand there are a lot of mistakes. For instance, Burgos is not near of Valencia. I supose that Dan Brown meant Palencia. <br />He told that David Becker dashed down leaping four or five stairs at a time, but, as long as I remember, in La Giralda there are not stairs, there are ramps. <br />The book is not translated to spanish. Anyway we don't like read that Spain is a \\"less refined country \\" . <br />And I think that is not true that getting an international connection from Spain is like roulette.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I love this album! This is my favorite of all of them. I picked this up after falling in love with The Eminem Show back in '02.     1. PSA 2000 - funnier than the announcement on the first album; this is a split-second long without any message on the edited album.   2. Kill You - talks about killing you if you (...) with him. 9/10  3. Stan - you have all heard this song. 9/10  4. Paul (Skit) - Paul sends a message to Em about how bad this album is; (I don't rate skits)  5. Who Knew - talks about how he writes music for everybody, not just for Blacks for just for Whites and talks about how he never knew he would be this successful. 10/10  6. Steve Berman (Skit) - tells Eminem how vulgar this album is and that they can't sell it.  7. The Way I Am - ya'll heard this song before. 10/10  8. The Real Slim Shady - ya'll heard this one too. 10/10  9. Remember Me (feat. RBX and Sticky Fingaz) - hot collabo with two rappers I have not heard from in the longest time. 10/10  10. I'm Back - tells everybody that he's back. 10/10  11. Marshall Mathers - talks about how he feels about certain things; and if you wonder what he says in that censored line, he says \\"Your attorney Fred Gibson's a f---ot\\"; best song on the album. 500/10  12. Ken Kaniff (Skit)  13. Drug Ballad - a party song about gettin' high. 9.5/10  14. Amityville (feat. Bizarre from D-12) - an extremely funny song; should have included the whole group. 10/10  15. Bitch Please 2 (feat. Dr. Dre, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Snoop Dogg) - sequel to Snoop Dogg's highly succesful single \\"Bitch Please\\", but not as great a song. 9/10  16. Kim - song about threatening to kill his ex-wife; this is NOT on the edited album, which is replaced by a South Park-humored song called \\"The Kids\\". 10/10  17. Under the Influence (feat. D-12) - the group is really funny on this song and Eminem tells people if they don't like him, they can suck his you-know-what. 10/10  18. Criminal - talks about how he is a criminal and that he hates the world. 10/10
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Actually my friends watched the movie, & told me that I won't like the movie, but since I'm CRAZY about Johny Depp, I bought the DVD. I just watched it last night & it kept me awake until 04:00 AM.  <br /> <br />This movie is AMAZING, one thing I felt sorry for (actually a couple!) is that it should have got the best picture award in the Oscars, & Depp definitely should have got the award for actor in leading role. <br /> <br />It's been a long time since I've been touched by a movie the way this one did, It kept me crying till I fell asleep. & believe it or not, I just wished that I could have some of the young innocence back. <br /> <br />As usual Johny Depp outdid himself, you have to love him in any role he does, Kate Winslet (although one of my least favorite) just was outstanding. & the best is the young boy playing Peter, he's just great. <br /> <br />This movie is a must see & must have in any movie Library.
B00005JNTV|5.0|\\"Sin City\\" is brilliant and beautiful looking! The all-star cast headlined by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, and Jessica Alba, are impressive. The directing by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino is brilliant. The visuals are astounding and brilliant. The music by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell, is impressive. This is a film that is different and unique from all other movies. It has a sight \\"Pulp Fiction\\" feel to it. This is one of the best pictures of the year!
B00003CXDB|5.0|Few movies capture the mind and heart as this movie. It is basically about Bud Fox, a sales manager in Wall Street. He deals mostly low-key shares and he is aiming for the big time. He seeks the opportunity to work with Gordon Gecko, a multi-billionaire investor who is smart as he is ruthless. Meanwhile, Bud Fox is also facing his father's criticism about what he does for a living...\\"Create, instead of living off the buying and selling of other people's money\\", his father says. I admit, I am addicted to this movie. Every few months, I have to slot in the DVD and watch it. It is a delight to watch every single time. This movie deals with many important and all too real issues. Everybody wants to be rich, but how far would you go to achieve that goal? Is it worth betraying the people you love? Changing your morals and values in life? And when you do make it big, who can you trust? How sure are you? These are just some of the elements Oliver Stone delved into in this movie. Using Wall Street and the share market as his backdrop, he has created a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />The first thing that immediately grabs you is the acting. Superb performances from some of the most talented but often misused actors in Hollywood. Michael Douglas has always been one of my favourite actors and in this movie, he IS Gordon Gecko. He is the epitome of corporate power. The way he speaks, and acts....classic stuff. One of my favourite scenes, is when he gives the speech during the shareholder meeting of Teldar Paper. Unbelievably good! He won a truly deserving Oscar for his portrayal of Gecko. Because of Douglas' fantastic acting, it tends to overshadow another actor who is as deserving of praise, Charlie Sheen. To be honest, I am not a fan of Charlie Sheen and found his acting mediocre in many movies, which was why I was pleasantly surprised with his acting here. He was really very good as Bud Fox, looking up to Gecko as his mentor, never overacting and having the coolness to pull off lines like \\"You get out that door, I'm changing the locks\\". He plays the part of a young man not knowing exactly what he wants in life once he achieved his idea of success perfectly. And the supporting cast, Martin Sheen (playing Bud Fox's dad with pure emotion, it seems like he's saying what he really means to his son) and Darryl Hannah (as Bud Fox's love interest) does not disappoint.  <br /> <br />Kudos to Oliver Stone for writing such a powerful script. This is not the usual garbage Hollywood likes to dump us with...this is a brilliant screenplay with great dialogue. \\"Greed will not only save Teldar Papers, but that other malfunctioning corporation known as the United States\\", Gecko says. Heck, even at home, I felt like giving a standing ovation to that. And the camera angles were also something I found fascinating in this movie. For example, when we're first shown Gecko, we don't get to see him immediately. Oliver Stone teases us with a Fortune magazine cover, and then by a shot of his office, when someone enters his office, the door opens and closes just enough time so that we get a glimpse of Gecko and hear his voice but never really getting a good look of him, right until Bud Fox meets with him. And towards the end, when things go wrong, a dark shadow falls upon the office. Beautiful!  <br /> <br />Honestly, everything about this movie seems to work perfectly, which is why the 5-star rating. This is one of my all-time favourites and I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you're involved in the share market or not, because the scope of this movie extends to so much more than that, that I'm sure different people would appreciate it on different levels. A definite must-see!
B000003B6J|5.0|I bought this cd when i was about 11 without my moms consent, of course she knew what it was im 18 now, and i still have it and still listen to it, this is one of the breakthrough albums for true gangsta rap along with Public Enemy which was alot more political than NWA but pretty much all rap was in those days..but anyway if you havent already heard this cd then you're way behind on times without a doubt go pick this up.
0385336810|5.0|Another fun series with the \\"Shopaholic\\" taste.  Emma is just a \\"ordinary, nothing special girl\\" until her life turns upside down from one plane ride.  Emma has a horrible fear of flying, and a bad batch of turbulence forces Emma to confess all of her secrets to the man sitting next to her.  As it turns it, this man happens to be her boss...her big boss that owns the company she works for!  Not only does he know her secrets around the office, love, and life, but he teases her about them!  This is a wonderfully sweet love story with ups and downs and a happy ending.  I LOVE this book and I hope there will be a sequel!
B0007P3582|3.0|<br />This album aint great, there are not enough good songs on a cd with as many songs as this! <br /> <br />First off: i never really liked 'Get Rich or Die Tryin' at first, but it did grow on me after a while although there weren't many great tracks again. This album is not growing on me at all, and there are only a few trax that i can listen to. <br /> <br />\\"Piggy Bank\\" - was a good song even though i prefer Jadakiss' music (& Fat Joe is involved in a lot of quality at the moment). The 'attacks' on artists weren't strong but there were a lot of people dissed. The overall thug feel of the song was good. <br /> <br />\\"So Amazing\\" - is very listenable and although very clichd and obvious, it will make a good single. Its just a decent rap-love song! <br /> <br />\\"Build You Up (Feat. Jamie Foxx)\\" - is a good song but it feels like it could be better  while listnin to it. Just lacks that bit of quality (probably 50's rappin). It starts real well and is still very likeable. <br /> <br />\\"God Gave Me Style\\" - is a song i dont listen to enough for some reason although my mind tells me i like it - cant say much more about it. <br /> <br />\\"Candy Shop\\" - aint great, but can be listenable at time but only due to the Scott Storch effect. <br /> <br />\\"Hate It Or Love It\\" - This is Game's song. Nuff said! <br /> <br />The other songs are 50 being/(tryin to be) gangsta but his rap voice sounds really weak. His rhymes are lacking a confidence, which is a sign of an artist not feeling great over the actual lyrics. He just aint audible enough sometimes. The songs aint total garbage but nothing is special here at all. \\"Disco Inferno\\" is a joke. Why it made the album, or even a single, or even went gold is laughable. Thats people livin of \\"In da Club\\". If I made that record, id be lucky if a radio station played it - and thats being serious!! <br /> <br />50 needs to add more to his lyrics and be confident with his flow. That shows a regression from \\"Get Rich...\\"! <br /> <br />Idont wanna point it out, but the songs i appreciate on this album are kinda love songs - like Jada said in his response to Piggy Bank. I didnt realise that till doing this review. <br /> <br />Its not the end of the world for 50 -  he still made 3stars!!!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|This is all of season 2 on dvd, which is very interesting, might I add!  From marrying Max to brekaing up with Max, Sookie marrying Jackson, and then the whole \\"Jess\\" thing, this season is full of excitement!  There are a few good special features, like International Success.  This is a great boxed set which I truly enjoy!
0792846443|5.0|Misery is one of those rare horror films where we get every component that makes a movie perfect. The acting is sensational, the plot line comes from the greatest Horror writer of all time and works very well, the production is good in general, and the suspense is mind boggling and terrifying.<br /><br />To briefly describe the plot, a famous author named Paul Sheldon (James Caan) gets into a car accident, suffering severe injuries to his legs. He is discovered and saved by a fan of his, named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). Sheldon is quick to learn that Annie is a huge fan of his work with a book series called Misery. What he doesn't know is that her love for his work goes even beyond extreme obsession, and she holds an unbreakable bond to the lead character in the series, Misery Chastain. This causes a devastating conflict for Sheldon, since he has decided to kill off the Misery Chastain and the series. We first notice her psychoticism at the point where she is urging Paul to burn his latest book, as she was given the rare opportunity to read his latest piece of work which is yet to be published.<br /><br />This film is put together with perfection, incorporating the small, necessary details from the novel into the film, while wisely leaving out the unnecessary ones. Kathy Bates gives a remarkable performance as Annie Wilkes, and was rightfully so honoured winning Best Actress at the Academy Awards in 1990. James Caan also delivers his character role exceptionally well, playing the suttle, shy and quick thinking Paul Sheldon. The minor characters, most notably the Sheriff do a great job adding to the plotline and making the film a thrill to watch.<br /><br />Misery surpasses a number of horror movies in its sensational quality, as it magnificently incorporates the suspense amongst numerous happenings. The story flows along very nicely, and there lies not a dull moment. The climax is truly stunning and captivating and will leave you in complete surprise. Another interesting quality this film offers is to intentionally have the viewer become frustrated with Mr. Sheldon's struggle to overcome his anxiety and pain.<br /><br />I would definitely have to recommend this film to all who love horror films, readers of Stephen King, or anyone who wants to see a true film of suspense and terror. Only the slowest of minds couldn't appreciate this work of genius. I also highly recommend reading the novel, as it does carry some significant differences to the film, and is just as suspenseful and exciting as the film.ilm offers is to intentionally have the viewer become frustrated with Mr. Sheldon's struggle to overcome his anxiety and pain.

B000002JS0|5.0|The New Remasters that came with the \\"Phase\\" 1,2 and 3 releases of the remasters showed just how in touch with the fans the band was and is. The packaging is superb, and the booklet is great. The reproduction of the original artwork is totally  fabulous.  On a regular stereo, as well as a 5.1  system, this disc is amazing. The work of George Marino ( as credited) is brilliant.  Absolutely none of this is dated. And to show just how good this album/cd  is, the album still has fan faves that work in concert.  My only complaint on re-hearing this album in remaster form after more than 15 years, is that the JACK has lyrics that are very different to the current ( last ten years or so) version of the song, and it is really Bon Scotts lyrics that are so very superior in form to what Brian  sings. Bon is the better singer, but since he has passed on in flesh, and lives on in album, we will not know just how good the current band would be with Bon.  Buy and enjoy.
0385510454|4.0|I have always adored Grisham's novels and films based upon them. The Broker has an excellent storyline but it dragged in places when the author gave intricate details about Italy and the language lessons.  They somehow detracted from the book from me so I am holding back that fifth star. With that said however, I would suggest this book for anyone intrigued by different countries and who is a lover of his previous works.
044024157X|4.0|This book I thought, was a slow starter, but as you got into it, it became better and better. I liked it more myself after about 150 pages. <br /> <br />Willie Traynor moves to Clanton back in 1970 as a newly graduated reporter. It just happened that within the time-frame of a year, he became the owner of Ford County's only newspaper. The paper was always famous for its well-crafted obituaries. The readership was very small until Willie takes over making it a 'new paper.'   <br /> <br />When the brutal murder of a young mom takes place, her children that she has left alone with no parent, are deeply scarred from having witnessed the crime. It was David Padgitt who committed this crime, and Willie does a VERY detailed story on the crime in the paper, and it's progress as David gets arrested. <br /> <br />The Padgitt's are a well-known wealthy family, who manage to get David out on parole after only 10 years in prison. When David is let out, the whole town is in a state of uproar, especially Willie, who speaks his mind at David's trial. Men and women who served on the jury 10 years ago, are suddenly being murdered, one by one. The killer, whom everyone knows is David himself, wants revenge and is going to get it.

B000002B1M|4.0|The second release from Queens Bridge proved not to be not much of a difference from his Illmatic debut.  Getting help from a more commercial type production from the Trackmasters, went well with the street tales of Nas.  The first song, or track 2, \\"The Message\\" has a sample of Sting's \\"Shape Of My Heart\\" where on this he continues to gain position as hip-hop/rap's elite.  The more captive, which became singles for the album, \\"Street Dreams\\" and \\"If I Ruled The World (Imagine That)\\" featuring Lauren Hill, contains a more commercial appeal with the samples and memorable hooks.  With Nas you could always expect some type of uplifting slash positive song as the \\"Black Girl Lost\\".  One of It Was Written's highlights, \\"I Gave You Power\\" produced by DJ Premier, similar to the concept of \\"Me And My Girlfriend\\" by 2pac, is one of the most deepest penned by Nas.  Nas kept his features on this release close to home with his Queensbridge mates Mobb Deep on \\"Live Nigga Rap\\" and his crew, The Firm, on \\"Affirmative Action\\".  Since Illmatic he's a lot sharper, more clever, and just plain better lyrically.  As the title and the hook goes on the Dr. Dre produced track, I'll end it with these three words, \\"Nas Is Coming\\".
B000002JS6|1.0|If you are looking for an album with songs that sound different from one another, this is not for you.  Every song starts with a similar guitar riff using the same 3 chords as the other songs.  Then the vocals come in, and this is even worse.  Brian Johnson has possibly the worst singing voice in history.  In the middle of every song is a guitar solo, and Angus Young isn't really that good at soloing so this is nothing special.   <br /> <br />The song that proves this theory the best is probably the title track.  It starts with a 3-chord riff that any guitarist in history could play.  The vocals come in sounding the same as always, and when the song gets to the chorus, Brian Johnson just sings the words \\"Back in Black\\" over and over again.  In the middle is a guitar solo that really isn't that good.  The best part of this song is when it is over and you don't have to listen any more. <br /> <br />When one song ends and a new one begins, you can hardly tell because they all have the same guitar with the same distortion, and the same irritating vocals \\"singing\\" the name of the song over and over again.  So once again if you are looking for a good album where each song sounds different from the last, this is not the album for you.
B000002L61|4.0|Originally released in 1984, this was Dio's second solo outing. Probably NOW being tagged as 'classic metal'. Who hates labeling music? I sure don't. Tracks that make this CD a true keeper are \\"We Rock\\" (VH1 Classic often plays the video), the title cut \\"The Last In Line\\", \\"One Night In The City\\", \\"Mystery\\" (remember plenty of Dio fans not liking this tune, I've always enjoyed hearing it) and the seven-minute \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\\". 'The Last In Line' was when keyboardist Claude Schnell had joined up with the band. I went and saw this tour the same summer Michael Jackson and his brothers had their 'Victory' tour. I kept telling people that FOR the money, you got a MUCH better show at Dio's extravaganza. Plus even though he's usually playing clubs now, looks like Dio's career had out lived Jackson's. Top of the line '80's metal release. Highly recommended. Long live DIO!!
B0007GAEW6|4.0|With 2003's De-Loused in the Comatorium, the Mars Volta explored the spacier side of rock without losing too much of the sound of At the Drive-In's \\"Relationship of Command.\\" Sure there were unpredictable prog freakouts, but with Rick Rubin behind the helm, they were mostly able to keep the jamming to a minimum and let the strengths of individual songs sell the album.    Not so with Frances the Mute. With Rodriguez Lopez in the Producer's seat, the Volta are free to do whatever they feel like, and it's quite clear to anyone who has heard this album that it is not a commercial venture. The songs are often extremely long (the longest is over 32 minutes and was broken into 8 tracks due to complaints from the label) and each includes some ambient noise that novice Volta listeners aren't likely to appreciate.     And in a sense, it's an absolute shame that these eccentricities are likely to alienate fans and first time listeners alike, because Frances the Mute is a remarkable album. \\"Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus\\" begins with an acoustic guitar movement, and switches from zero to sixty in under 30 seconds. Breakneck basslines and some remarkable guitar wankery from Omar make this track a gem, even though the ambience at the end could definitely be cut down. \\"The Widow\\" showcases the the band's ability to make a radio friendly single and not betray their own weird sense of style. It's slow moving acoustic buildup is reminiscent of \\"Televators,\\" and that's definitely a good thing. \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" is easily the best track on the album, a 14 plus minute spanglish powerhouse. Once again, however, the band is going to alienate listeners with the massive amount of ambience that stretches from the end of L'via through the first five minutes of the next song, \\"Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore.\\" The latter, like \\"the Widow,\\" showcases the band's ability to work with standard song structures when they need to. It's a gorgeous melody, it could probably be the album's secondsingle, if they cut out the ambience from the beginning and the noise from the end.    And of course, the 32 minute sprawling 8 track opus known as \\"Cassandra Gemini\\" tends to be the dealmaker or the dealbreaker. It's either everything you love about this group, or everything you hate about this group. You either have the patience to sit this one out multiple times and start to discover the beauty of it, and love the band even more, or you're going to hate it right away and that will be that. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you have patience, an open mind, and a sense of adventure, Frances the Mute might be the album for you. It was definitely the album for me.
B00028HBKM|3.0|\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is unlike any other film most of us have seen. I think that's something on which we can agree.<br /><br />The message Mel Gibson intends to convey here is summed up by the first image the viewer sees (after the production company logo): The text of Isaiah 53:5 - which, in the New International Version, says: \\"He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. (NIV)\\"<br /><br />If you will not, under any circumstances, allow yourself or your family to see graphic violence, take the Isaiah verse as Gibson's \\"don't say I didn't warn you\\" message. The Bible tells us Jesus suffered much on what we now call Good Friday, and if Gibson is to illustrate the wounds by which \\"we are healed,\\" dear movie viewer, things are going to get ugly. By making this movie, I think Gibson wanted to show the audience that he clearly believes his sin (and yours, mine and that of every mortal man and woman who ever lived) caused Jesus, who was without sin, to endure mocking, scorn, a long, brutal whipping, followed by more mocking and scorn, followed by another beating, followed by a long walk up Golgotha with the heavy wooden cross to which his stretched-out limbs were nailed - the cross on which He endured still more mocking and scorn, and eventually died. I think Gibson succeeds in illustrating the sacrifice Jesus made, and in illustrating the depths of brutality he believes a person is capable of inflicting - literally as well as figuratively - out of selfish pride. I think that's all he really intended to portray.<br /><br />The violence shown in the movie is graphic, but the press had carried so many stories that discussed the violent scenes that I failed to be shocked once I actually saw the movie.<br /><br />I think \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is an important movie because it got a lot of people talking about Jesus outside of church, but if you're looking for something that offers comprehensive coverage of Jesus' life and teachings, you won't find that here. I also caution against substituting this, or any movie, for scripture if you're looking for a way to share the Gospel - as some people seem to have done (I could elaborate on this, but the review is already getting a bit long). But if you're looking for a powerful story and a well-made movie, you will find that in \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\"<br /><br />Mel Gibson's decision to use Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin rather than English was a great one. The multi-lingual scripting more effectively shows the cultural divisions that existed between the Romans and Judeans. We've already seen Jesus movies where everyone speaks English. It's about time for something different. The actors do a good job of putting feeling into their lines even though they aren't speaking their native languages.<br /><br />Also on the movie's choice of languages - a response to another review. The statement about the language of Jesus' day being Greek, not Aramaic or Hebrew, is incorrect. The original New Testament language was Greek, but the NT was written down years after Christ's life on Earth. Just because the Bible is written in Greek or Hebrew doesn't mean those are the only languages the people spoke in those days in those places. Re-read your Bible intro, do a little more research on the Bible and Middle Eastern history, or find someone who has done the research before presenting your biases as \\"facts.\\" Mel Gibson did his homework on the languages (so did the actors). Other aspects of the movie that are being debated (appearance of the devil, the demon kids haunting Judas,etc.) are a matter of theological viewpoint and artistic license (things we haven't seen, such as demons that must have haunted Judas during and after the betrayal, have to be expressed visually because this is a movie!) Please remember that \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" was not meant to be a documentary, nor was it meant to be \\"The Bible on Film.\\"<br /><br />I only give 3 stars here because I haven't wanted to buy this DVD and watch this movie for a third, fourth or fifth time while sitting in my jammies munching on popcorn and pizza.

0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is an amazing book.  It is a fast paced page turner, with an interesting story within a story and great characters (especially Fermin).  The book combines the genres of mystery, thriller and love story within the story of a young boy's coming of age.  This is the best book I have read in a long time!
630471193X|4.0|I came to this film with low expectations, seeing as how it only has a 53% positive RottenTomatoes.com rating and a lot of critics panned it as being corny and sentimental.<br /><br />Actually this is a very good film, largely carried by the strong cast of John Travolta, Kyra Sedgewick, Forest Whitaker and Robert Duvall.  Yes there are a few corny moments especially towards the end but they were forgivably brief not tediously drawn out, compared to your typical Hollywood tearjerker which this is not.  I won't give away the ending except to say that it is not one of your dime a dozen and-they-lived-happily-ever-after things.<br /><br />\\"Phenomenon\\" actually has a lot of Eastern philosophy behind it---the idea that we are all connected at a deep cosmic and psychical level which most of us never imagine nor dare to access, as well as the New Ageish belief that we only use about 10% of our brains' full capabilities.<br /><br />Travolta is known to be a Scientologist, which made me wonder a little how much that might have influenced this film which is nowhere near as kooky as your standard Scientology doctrine which you can get from L. Ron Hubbard's infamous (science fiction) book, \\"Dianetics.\\"
0060005424|4.0|\\"Lirael\\" is a truly excellent book, melding an exciting plot, excellent characterization and an interesting world.  Lirael is a well-written character with whom I can truly empathize; she's extremely believable, even in a fantasy world. <br /> <br />Sam is, again, very believable; he's not all-powerful, he has his flaws.  His conflicts and fears give so much room for character development, but he's fun to read about. <br /> <br />One thing which did I did not like about the book, however, was that it didn't truly seem to go anywhere.  There was a lot of foreshadowing and buildup... and then it ended.  The plots are all finished and the loose ends tied up in Abhorsen, but I think that it was a bit of a let-down. <br /> <br />However, the book is truly excellent and absorbing.  The world is vivid and real, and you'll never get bored with it or the book.

0066620996|4.0|This isn't a great book.  It's just a good book.  I think that's funny.<br /><br />You can learn a lot from this book, but it is fundamentally flawed.  The flaw is that this book is written to CEO's.  This book is not written to you and me.  That means that if you and I read this book, there isn't a d*mn thing that we can do to apply anything we learn from it.<br /><br />There is another gaping flaw in this book, and that is that this book is written in \\"Bible\\" format.  Much like \\"The Goal,\\" \\"Reengineering the Corporation,\\" and the actual Bible, this book gives enough information to make you feel empowered and important, but is loose enough so that you can make any interpretation you want out of it.<br /><br />I've seen so many misinterpretations of this book.  One company interprets \\"The Brutal Facts\\" as an excuse for firing people.  One company forces all of their employees to read this book, hoping that morale will improve.  One company's management reads this book and pats themselves on the back, even though they resemble the comparison companies more than the G2G companies.<br /><br />So, my only hope is that if you're an owner of a company, that you personally apply this book, and don't force a loose interpretation of this book on your employees.  This book is written to you--it's not written to them.<br /><br />Also, all of the people who say that the survey methodology of only doing a dozen companies is bogus--those people are full of crap.  Also, the exhaustive justification given by G2G of how the dozen companies is statistically sound--that's also full of crap.<br /><br />This book isn't a statistics book.  This book is a compilation of observations by a small team about a dozen companies.  No more, no less.  It is neither statistically sound nor statistically unsound.  It's simply observations.<br /><br />This is the ultimate feel good book, if you are a manager.  It's also a good way to claim that you've read a 300+ page management book by only reading 200 pages, since the appendix is 100+ pages long.

1400076943|5.0|Adichie's novel is a wonderful read. It is poetic and sparing and yet deals with important issues and fascinating ideas. It discusses religion and concepts of good and evil. Though Kambili's father is violent and brutal, he is also loving and generous towards his community. It explores ideas of colonialism and how the Western world views Africa and their other colonies. One of the most memorable statements made by Kambili was when the sister/ mother in school failed to understand why they did up their houses in the suburbs like palaces when they only spent a week or 2 in it a year. Kambili's response was that there is no need to find the reason for everything, to seek to understand, as that's just the way things are done. Oftentimes when cultures come together there is always a desire to unravel to seek to explain when really, there should just be mutual acceptance. The book was also very well written when exploring the growth of Kambili into a young woman as well as how she starts to speak, smile and even laugh. Jaja is also a fascinating character in the way he progresses and changes through the influence of his aunt Ifeoma and the exposure to a world outside of his father's rules. Other well developed characters are Father Amadi and aunt Ifeoma, so that it feels like you're watching real people on a screen rather than just reading about them in a book. A wonderful, moving study of beliefs, world views, religion, love, relationships and good evil, Adichie's novel paints a colourful Africa full of life, pride and passion as well as a gift of renewing itself.

B00009L1OB|4.0|Many of us from the 80's first bought \\"Rio\\" and thought man this is good. Then, we bought the first record and thought, man, this one is better. Then, 20 years later, we go back and listen to all of the records and think they all sound dated but when we listen to the 3rd effort \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger,\\" we think, man, this one is good, more listenable in the year 2005 then its 2 predecessors. I think many of the new revival bands today have taken much from this collection of Duran Duran. The tracks are uneven and not classics, but there is something that says, man this was an important record.Just listen to the Killers or Franz Ferdinand. \\"Seven\\" is an important record. The songs are good but not great.  The instrumental \\"Tiger Tiger\\" beckons Roxy Music---dreamy, exotic, Romantic, ethereal....This is probably the best song on the record--a backdrop for any occasion. \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" is probably the second best song on the record--an extension of \\"Tiger Tiger\\" but with lyrics--dreamy, weaving synthesizers around Simon's voice. The Reflex and Union of the Snake are excellent songs--good choices for the Ipod when it comes to choosing Duran Duran hits easily holding their own against any of the good 80's tunes. Overall, it was Duran's last voice of the early 80's ---a disappointment at the time, but a hit now.
1593072937|5.0|This paperback edition is perfectly good. I thought I might need the hardcover for extra durability, but it was sort of out of my price range. The paperback turned out being more than adequate-and easy on my eyes. Once I got used to the comic format, I thought the story and artwork were fantastic. The pictures required my concentration though at times like for action sequences.. I can't wait to read the other 6 books-or to see the movie.
0790731509|5.0|Cool Hand Luke is a great movie from the 60s that features one of Paul Newman's best performances.  After slicing the heads off of parking meters, Lucas Jackson is sent to work on a chain gang for two years.  At first, Luke is disliked by many of his fellow inmates, but with time he comes to earn their respect.  However, Luke is the rebellious type and refuses to be broken down by authority.  This is a great movie about a rebel who refuses to give in to authority no matter what the consequences.  Luke is somewhat of an outcast who has never fit in with the \\"norm\\" of society.  Cool Hand Luke is full of famous scenes/lines like the \\"What we have here is a failure to communicate\\" line or the eating 50 eggs in an hour scene, but overall the movie is about one's man refusal to live the norm.  Highly recommended if you have not seen it.      Paul Newman gives one of his best performances as Lucas Jackson, a rebellious prisoner on a chain gang who refuses to give up or be beaten down by authority.  Newman's Luke is a man who struggles with the hand he has been dealt in life, and tries to overcome those problems.  George Kennedy won a Best Supporting Oscar for his role as Dragline, a fellow member of the chain gang who becomes Luke's friend.  Strother Martin is excellent as the Captain, the warden of the facility who delivers the \\"communication\\" line.  In a brief, one-scene part, Jo Van Fleet is perfect as Arletta, Luke's dying mother.  The chain gang is a huge list of character actors including JD Cannon, Lou Antonio, Robert Drivas, Harry Dean Stanton, Wayne Rogers, and a young Dennis Hopper.  The movie also stars Morgan Woodward as Boss Godfrey, \\"No Eyes,\\" Luke Askew, Anthony Zerbe, and Clifton James.      This is a movie that deserves a 2-disc special edition DVD, not the lousy cardboard Warner Brothers version with no extras other than a trailer and widescreen presentation.  Moviegoers obviously love this movie so why isn't there a Special Edition DVD out there?  Still, this is a classic movie and a must-have overall, so don't let this DVD scare you away.
B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater isn't your average metal band, they're something above and beyond the rest, and this album is no exception. <br /> <br />A little weird lyric-wise, but in terms of its musicality, it is an excellent album. Starts off with a weird but involving track, 6:00, and progresses to Erotomania, an instrumental that is easily one of the best tracks on the album. Space-Dye Vest is the final track and is one of their slower songs but is very moving musically. <br /> <br />A must-have for any Dream Theater fan, and if you're not a fan yet, this is a good place to start!

0618526412|3.0|While beautifully written by McCullers at the young age of 23, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, unlike the vast preponderance of classics I have encountered, left me with little enduring excitement or profundity.  John Singer makes for hardly a compelling protagonist and McCullers' characterization is lacking at best.  We never really get to know the real John Singer as we encounter a bevy of vapidly shallow supporting characters clinging to his very being.<br /><br />I kept waiting for the book to build plot development and come through with some profound theme or happening...but to no avail.  Many other classics of this genre far outweigh this effort -- including, but not limited to, Black Boy, Invisible Man, & To Kill a Mockingbird just to name a few.

0671027387|4.0|The book is essentially a fast-paced thriller, like many other books by Dan Brown. The whole plot is wrapped around the structures of power in Washington D.C. - the White House, presidential candidates, various TLAs (Three Letter Agencies), etc. NASA is some sort of collective character and not exactly one of the happiest, i'd say.<br /><br />The central point of the scenario is the discovery of a certain object buried into the ice somewhere in the Arctic zone. Typical to Brown, the discovery begins in a certain way, only to quickly reveal itself as something else entirely, which is exactly the fuel needed for the twisted plot to take off.<br /><br />For the fans of the genre, the book proves to be an entertaining read. The author is a confident master of the typical tools required to build a thriller, and the plot has more tight turns than the digestive tube of a giant herbivore. The pace of the action is extremely fast; the book is not very big, yet a lot of things happen from page one to the end. Jamesbond-ish hi-tech gadgeds are peppered all over and the author goes on and on describing self-assuredly all kinds of technologies supposedly used by the US military and special forces. A notice at the beginning of the book claims that \\"all technologies described in this novel exist.\\" It could be, even though the book certainly seems to dip its toes into sci-fi waters at times.<br /><br />Then there's the typical (for Dan Brown) ultra-super-twist of the plot when the reader is led to believe that the driving force behind some events is a certain character, only to find in amazement that it's actually someone else. Well, \\"in amazement\\" only when i read the other book; now it was kinda artificial and rather annoying.<br /><br />Also, the characters are rather sketchy, but then this is a thriller, so character development is at the very bottom of the list of priorities. It's still irritating that mature and intelligent characters use rather infantile and crude mannerisms and ways of speaking (a senior glaciologist from the U. of New Hampshire says \\"bite me\\" among her very first sentences in the book). Making the characters lively and dynamic is one thing, making them into caricatures is another matter entirely.<br /><br />Overall it's likable, for those who enjoy thrillers. But probably not the kind of book to return to after a while.nnerisms and ways of speaking (a senior glaciologist from the U. of New Hampshire says \\"bite me\\" among her very first sentences in the book).

1400032717|5.0|I didn't much care for the protagonist of this terrific novel--and that's a compliment to the author! I felt sorry for Christopher and I now understand the overwhelming world that autistic children must deal with if they are survive with any chance of success. But Christopher's screaming--he's 15!--at the littlest provocations really provoked a strong reaction in me. For an author to create a character whom I knew I would personally struggle to like, and yet to keep me very involved in his story, is a true accomplishment. I know I would not be a good parent for an autistic child, more like Christopher's mother than his ever-patient father. Christopher is at times likeable, at times irritating (for me, mostly the latter), but I did enjoy the book, I learned a lot from reading it, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who might come into contact with autistic people.
B00005JA2B|4.0|This is without a doubt the best album ever produced by Kansas, and possibly one of my favorites of all time. Killer lead vocals, great guitar solos, and a unique musicality that no other band can capture make this album a classic that no classic rock fan should be without. <br /> <br />Carry On Wayward Son is a classic that none of up will ever get tired of. What's on My Mind shows more of their straight rock-out nature (as opposed to their progressive nature) and has a great riff. Opus Insert is another great progressive and Magnum Opus is possibly their most progressive piece ever. It starts off with timpani solo, to give you an idea. <br /> <br />Overall, a killer album and a must-buy. Unfortuntately, to those wondering why I gave it the 4-star rating, I am not particularly pleased with the remastering job here. The mixing is not very good at all in some places, and while you do acheive a completely new level of fidelity, the overall effect is somewhat subdued due to the way it is mixed. To those with fresh ears, the old version probably sounds worse, so don't let this discourage you.
B00005JNTV|4.0|Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and QT (his 2 cents worth) have made a stunningly singular film that makes for a quite a memorable moviegoing experience.  While it may be too violent for the soccer moms of our world and not politically correct for the more anal among us...who cares??? It's a free country and if you don't condone violent movies, then simply don't go - period.  Jamie King is drop dead gorgeous, as is Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy.<br /><br />Benecio Del Toro proves to be the best among the male cast as the mercurial Jackie Boy, although Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis (and surprisingly Elijah Wood) more than hold their own as well.

For anyone who listens to qotsa, you know all the albums take a few times to catch your attention. This one is no different. And for those critical of josh for using songs off of Desert Sessions, youre dumb. Hangin tree, Millionaire, If Only, and Monsters in the parasol were all used off prior cds. Nicks bass and voice did add more depth to the cds, but his departure doesnt make anything worse for the band. Everybody Knows that youre insane and Tangled up in plaid are my favorites. The only song that is not awesome is Skin on skin, which is still a decent song.    I highly recommend buying this cd and keep listening to the Queens
0345357116|5.0|I found Unfinished Tales to be a pretty good book. It is more piecemeal than the completed novels, The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, which was in progress when J.R.R. Tolkien died. The Silmarillion was pulled together and edited by his son Christopher.<br /><br />The book is separated into four sections. The first section is the First Age and contains stories on the coming of Tuor to Gondolin and the tale of Hurin's Children. The Tale of Hurin's children in touched on in the Silmarillion but this story is much more in-depth and while fans of the Tolkien mythologies know is a tragic tale this version is most complete.<br /><br />The second section of the book is the Second Age and focuses much on the Numenor. There is a description of the island of Numenor. This section contains the tale of the Mariner's Wife, which is another great and tragic story among the tales of Middle-Earth. There is a section on various kings of Numenor and a History of Galadriel and Celeborn. I found the history of Galadriel very interesting, and full of information that made events in later tales more meaningful<br /><br />The third section of Unfinished Tales is the Third Age. This portion of the book contains: The Disaster on the Gladden Fields, a history on the relationship between Gondor and Rohan, The Quest for Erebor, a portion on the hunt for the One Ring, And the Battles of the Rods of Isen, which ultimately lead to the death of Theodred, the son of King Thoden. This section of the book had lots of additional information for fans of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbits to consume and make their enjoyment of the stories that much fuller.<br /><br />The fourth and final section of the book contains sections on the Druedain (or Wild Men), the Istari (or Wizards) and the palantiri (or seeing stones). This section was also very valuable in adding information to the Lord of the Rings. I was very fond of the story The Faithful Stone and found the history of the Wild Men more colorful than expected. My suspicions about the origin of the Istari were validated in this section of the book as well. And my understanding of the palantiri went up substantially from near zero.<br /><br />Overall I would suggest this book to any Tolkien fan after reading at least the Lord of the Rings but better to have read the Hobbit and Silmarillion to get the most out of the tales and told in Unfinished Tales. Unfortunately, the stories are unfinished and in a few cases I found myself really wanting more but that's just the way it goes.he Wild Men more colorful than expected.

B000003S09|5.0|It is sad that some trolling imbeciles actually get attention for scrawling out unsubstantiated opinions the way a twelve year old might make quip remarks on US foreign policy or the media. Every plumber is entitled to their opinion on how to judge a beauty contest but knowing their expertise is in lead pipes and not the subtle curves of the female form one might think this person's \\"judgement\\" should be better spent dealing with something they're more familiar with such as raw sewage.     King Crimson is probably not where progressive music fans start out and that's understandable. There is no point in tossing a meaty meal to a young and inexperienced pup who wouldn't know what to do with it. Better someone cut their teeth on something easier after weaning their baby nubbins on artists like Nico and The Velvet Underground who personally I find thin and more than a little lame. Typical NY style noise and not really anything worthy of notice let alone comment.     KC on the other hand has always been made up of established studio musicians and songwriters who have gained the highest accolades from fellow musicians/artists and fans alike. Even if you aren't a fan of progressive music any informed opinion would still have to take into account the complexity of the works penned by Fripp and company before passing it off as \\"self indulgent crap posing as rock music\\". Anyone who would mistake anything on this title as belonging to the same musical category as TVU or SLADE or CCR or GFR or any other basic group should realize \\"rock\\" is a meaningless term frequently coined by self righteous clods when bashing something they can't possibly comprehend (usually meaning anything consisting of more than three chords) or an inexplicable change in cadence that might cause their droolpan to come unhinged.     If someone wants to listen to \\"crap\\" (self indulgent or otherwise... incidentally most people in the know would consider Van Gough's and Michelangelo's works to be self-indulgent. Virtually all real art is!) then that's their prerogative as music is an entirely subjective experience. There is no bad music as long as it makes someone feel good. In that respect I'm sure that The Velvet Underground and NICO are at least as good as Michael Jackson, Snoop Dog or Britanny Spears and anyone who enjoys that kind of stuff should certainly defend their right to feed at the trough of their choice. Personally I prefer a finer sort of dining (cutlery mandatory) and music that doesn't require a very hot shower and lots of soap afterward.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This is the best and most emotional movie ever made.  It will never be surpassed! <br /> <br />Titanic RULES!!!
B00005JNQS|4.0|ROBOTS opens with an overly excited robot father, Herb Copperbottom (Stanley Tucci), racing down the streets of Riveton (a place that looks like a mechanical version of a Norman Rockwell-small town) telling everyone he is going to be a father. Upon his arrival at home, he and the wife get to work putting together their baby boy. The baby &#34;grows&#34; up by replacing his parts every year. Rodney grows up watching a Mr. Bigweld show on television with his father. Mr. Copperbottom looks up to Mr. Bigweld as the greatest robot in the world. Bigweld is responsible for a huge production company in Robot City that produces replacement parts for Robots around the world. He also has an open-door policy encouraging any robot with an idea to come see him.<br /><br />After causing havoc in the kitchen where Rodney's father works, Rodney boards a train and sets forth to Robot City to meet Bigweld. He meets up with a group of outcasted robots--Piper, Crank, and Fender--who help him find a place to stay and get a start on his own after learning that Bigweld is no longer running his company and that an evil executive named Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) is now in charge. Ratchet has plans to get rid of outmoded robots and turn them into scrap metal. It eventually ends up leading to a battle between differing values, the old-school, common 'bots fighting against Ratchet and his army of sweepers and hatcheteers.<br /><br />Visually, ROBOTS is unbelievable. The robots in the movie appear more life-like than any animated robots seen on screen before. Vivid colors brilliantly fill the screen filling one with wonderful optic sensations. Younger children especially will be attracted to the film because of the bold use of color.<br /><br />The movie is also filled with all kinds of humor and cultural references. There's the occasional juvenile toilet gag thrown in, but many of the jokes go beyond that.<br /><br />In a movie that is largely about color, it also uses sound throughout. In a world filled with robots, it would only seem appropriate that things are more noisy than they are in the real world. With all the metal clunking around, noise is bound to be made. In addition, there the movie boasts a fairly decent soundtrack that set the mood for many of the movie's scenes.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching ROBOTS. However, as much as I liked it, I felt that the general plot and pacing of the movie suffered. Though the movie's general plot might not be all that original, it seemed that the filmmakers initially set out to give their own original take on the story. The movie moved along at a nice pace and didn't feel forced. But that changed during the last half of the movie. Right around the time that Rodney and Cappy go to Bigweld's mansion, things domino downhill. Up to that point the movie was fine, but from that point on it felt as if the filmmakers wanted to rush to the movie's conclusion to get it over. The last 1/3rd of the film doesn't fit or flow with everything previous to it. Cliches are overused and everything is just too pat-pat. For instance, a &#34;romance&#34; between Cappy & Rodney is forced, but the movie would have been more interesting if Piper and Rodney got together.

In addition to that, because ROBOTS is from FOX animation, the long trailer for REVENGE OF THE SITH is supposed to be shown before every ROBOTS showing.

With all the metal clunking around, noise is bound to be made. In addition, there the movie boasts a fairly decent soundtrack that set the mood for many of the movie's scenes.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching ROBOTS. However, as much as I liked it, I felt that the general plot and pacing of the movie suffered. Though the movie's general plot might not be all that original, it seemed that the filmmakers initially set out to give their own original take on the story. The movie moved along at a nice pace and didn't feel forced. But that changed during the last half of the movie. Right around the time that Rodney and Cappy go to Bigweld's mansion, things domino downhill.

068983571X|5.0|Published in the beginning of the XX Century, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" was a huge hit. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was virtually pressed to write it, because there was so much demand for the character. And even `under pressure' he managed to write a very interesting novel, that has became timely and has entertained readers for over a hundred years.<br /><br />Narrated by Sherlock Holmes's best friend, Mr Watson, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is pretty much what its title says. For years a curse frightened the Baskerville family with a huge and deadly hound. Most believe this is a supernatural event, related to the forces of evil. Holmes, on the other hand, who is a very scientific and logic man, refuses to believe in this explanation. At least, until all the logical possibilities are ruled out.<br /><br />The device of picking Dr Watson -- who is an everyman -- as narrator serves to makes us feel closer to the brilliant Holmes. Not only are the readers connected with Watson by his narration, but, mostly because we tend to have the same common sense analyzes of the situation. Therefore, the detective has the advantage of bringing a different light to a problem. Doyle always provides him with more information than we have. It is a kind of cheat, because sometimes Holmes is not really cleverer -- just more informed. But, the book is so much fun that readers don't really mind being deceived. Moreover, Holmes has a huge ego and it makes him even more fun.<br /><br />One major conflict guides the novel: the battle between `Natural x Supernatural'. Dr Mortimer, the person who tells Holmes and Watson the hound curse, believe that this is a supernatural affair. However, to the detective the story points to the logical.

B0007O38F8|1.0|Anybody that ever thought that 50 cent was good rapper was wrong. Listen to this album and you will know what I mean. It sucks. His mono-tone rapping style is enough to put me to sleep. He has no style.
B000006Z1X|4.0|Five stars if the lyrics weren't in need of improvement; but this disc rocks.  Malmsteen had the chops but the songwriting and musicianship seems more all of a piece here.  Some of the songs from [[ASIN:B00006BGXQ No Parole from Rock 'n' Roll]], like \\"Island in the Sun\\" just seem a total mismatch once this neo-Classical Malmsteen virtuoso guitar solo  seemingly drops in from nowhere. Not to denigrate Malmsteen's obvious talent. On this one, it just sounds like things were better coordinated.<br /><br />Rumor has it Vai has his own mix of the masters.  THIS I want to hear.
B000002L7Y|5.0|It is true, that Ah-Ha never quite reproduced that atmospherically up-lifting sond of \\"Hunting High and Low\\", but that by no means suggests this band should be written off as a one-hit wonder. This album contains some of the greatest synth arrangements of the 80's. While the two singles that this album produced are both excellent in their own right, there is far more to discover throught the remaining 8 songs. \\"The Blue Sky\\", \\"Here I Stand and Face the Rain\\", and the album's title track are just three examples of this record's fantastic playlist . I hadn't even been born at the time of A-Ha's but it isn't difficult to understand why it was so popular, or why it's also consisdered to be the band's only true album. If your a fan of the European invasion that completely ruled the decade of the 80's, Hunting hight and Low is a must have for your album collection. So, forget about the label of Ah-Ha being a one hit wonder and pick this album up today. You won't regret it, trust me!
B000001GS0|5.0|I've been dissatisfied with many recordings of these symphonies. Von Karajan muffles the tympani immediately into the 1st, Klemperer confirms his reputation for sleeping at the podium, and Haitink makes them sound like Tchaikovsky. Toscanini was at his best with Brahms, but the sound quality was not. Same for Furtwangler.<br /><br />With Jochum, highly regarded for his Haydn and Bruckner, one has a choice between DG in mono and EMI in stereo. Only DG offers all 4 symphonies on 2 CDs, and there need be no worries over this late-mono recording - its the best of its time, very clean and dynamic in this excellent DG Originals remaster.<br /><br />Best of all, the performances are really dramatic and exciting. Jochum & the BPO deliver a full-scale orchestral sound with just the right balance of agility and weight for all occasions, managing the pace so that Brahms' melodic and harmonic structures are beautifully shaped with neo-classical precision, recalling Bach as much as Beethoven, while gathering power for spine-tingling climaxes that leave the listener spellbound.<br /><br />I've enjoyed this set for years and I always feel exhilarated whenever I hear it. Though Jochum seems to draw more attention for his Bruckner, I find this set to be his most impressive achievement on record. And his London Symphonies, for those who appreciate the old performance style with Haydn's music, also hold up well over time.

0452284392|5.0|\\"Linked\\" by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi should be read by all who would know how intricate systems like the World Wide Web are interconnected for several reasons. First, he writes well, developing in narrative form the emergence of his interest in the subject. This is unusual for a scientist. Second, he thoroughly understands his subject, as is often not the case for science writers. Finally, the author presents several quantitative ideas which the general reader will find useful.<br /><br />The most important of the ideas he presents is the prevalence of \\"power-law distributions\\" of the interconnections in many linked systems that have grown naturally, including movies (by their actors), members of an audience (through auditory cues), social systems (family ties, school ties, friendships, etc.), biological organisms (biochemical signals), the brain (neural interconnections), the WWW (URL links), and so on.<br /><br />A fascinating fact, which has been determined by those programs that crawl through the internet gathering data on linkage, is that the probability of a site (yours?) having k links is proportional to k raised to the minus 2.1 power. Thus if there are N links to your site, a bit of math shows that you are among the highest M sites, where M equals one over N raised to the 1.1 power. You can estimate N for your home page by picking a key phrase from it and looking on Google. Try it!<br /><br />Alwyn Scott<br /><br />[...]
B000002J09|5.0|First things first: The person who comapared Jimmy Page to Avril Lavigne...there are no words to describe you. Jimmy Page compared to Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton, alright, you got yourself an arguement, but Avril Lavigine? C'mon now.  <br /> <br />Anyways, I love this album with the exception of Battle of Evermore. Not a big fan of that song. There's a lot of Zeppelin haters out there, and that's fine. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, whatever.  <br /> <br />As for those comparing Zeppelin to stuff like Celine Dion, Good Charolette, and Avril Lavigne, you people should be kept out of the gene pool.
B000002I6T|5.0|See the one thing about David Crosby is that he carries so much negative press an album like this can be dismissed by a casual music listener very easy.  The thing about Cros is he has been conected to so many different artists in the last 40+ years its insane. David Crosby is the \\"Kevin Bacon\\" of music.  (He can be conected to just about any artist in a matter of moves (albums, groups, tours, etc). From playing with the Byrds to singing backround vocals on the debut Hootie and Blowfish album, this man had been everywhere.    This 1971 album is the wild card. Just look at the personel. From Joni Mitchell, NY of CSNY, Grateful Dead all but Weir and PigPen, and the Jefferson Airplane. Plus there is a nod to David Geffen cited for album direction.    Still not convinced? Well thats ok.  The songs are the proof.  \\"Music is love\\" which may be a statement to Cros's career.  You can pick out Neil Young singing in there too. \\"What are their names\\" One with plenty of Dead noodling and some awesome lyrics about politics. Written by Young, Lesh, Garcia, and Shrieve. The best part of the album is \\"Cowboy Movie\\" which I have heard is actually a song about the break up of CSNY. Just look at these lyrics and decide for yourself...Now, Eli (Stills), he's our fastest gunner/He's kind of mean and young from the South/he said, \\"Fat Albert (Crosby), you're getting kind of old and weird now.\\"/\\"You'd better get your twelve gauge shot gun right out(play solo?).\\"/Now Eli and the Duke (Young)they got down to it/they each wanted the Indian girl (Rita Coolidge)for their own/but when they finally got around to asking her/you know she said she'd come to take young Billy (Nash)home/Eli said he'd kill young Billy/he'd kill the Duke, and probably me too.    So there you have it. The song is awesome 8 minute epic with some obvious help from the Dead on it.      If you are a fan of CSN(Y), Jefferson Airplane (you wont get \\"white rabbit\\" or \\"someone to love\\") , Grateful Dead you will not be dissapointed with album at all.  It is a nice piece of history before ego's exploded and an album like this would be nearly impossible to make without label and contract red tape. Well what are you waiting for!? Go buy it now!
B00005O7RE|5.0|Mariah Carey has the most beautiful, powerful, soaringly 7 octave range voice I've ever heard!!! This Christmas CD has been in my CD collection since 1994 when it came out and I listen to it every year. Mariah makes all the traditional songs like Joy To The World, O Holy Night (my all time fav from this album and Mariah's version tops every other version out there ever!!!), Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town and others so beautiful and danceable especially her own song she wrote, All I Want For Christmas Is You (a song that I always find myself dancing to!). Another favorite is one she wrote called Miss You Most At Christmas Time, Mariah's voice soars!!! I also love Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child, such a wonderful gospel song!! I actually love Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child so much that if I was to sing just one song at my church, it would be Jesus, O What A Wonderful Child!! It's an incredible Gospel song and I love the choir and makes me feel so energized and makes me feel like I'm in church!! It has become my all time favorite Gospel song because I feel and hear so much energy throughout the song and Mariah is so amazing!!!<br /><br />Mariah's version of Joy To The World is incredible, Mariah really knows how to turn this classic into a dance hit!! I totally love how Mariah made a Club Mix and Celebration Mix to Joy To The World and the music video is awesome too! I love that part in the Celebration Mix when Mariah goes \\"Gonna Have A Good Time, There's A Party Over Here\\" and then you hear the Choir singing \\"Joy To The World, Joy To The World!\\" I like how she incorporated that one part from Three Dog Night's Joy To The World in \\"Joy To The World, All The Boys And Girls\\" and I just love how she is so upbeat and everything!!! If you don't have the CD single of All I Want For Christmas Is You with the Club Mix and Celebration Mix of Joy To The World, I highly recommend you get it because it is well worth it!!<br /><br />I once let a guy friend I have who is also a Christian like I am, hear Mariah's Joy To The World and his words exactly were \\"This is a drinking song\\" and I was like, this is NOT a drinking song!! I don't take things like that seriously because I know Mariah meant no harm to include those few lyrics which also has all three real Joy To The World verses in it, it just made the song more unique and I love it!! Besides, the part \\"Joy To The World, All The Boys And Girls\\" fits Christmas perfectly, there's nothing wrong with putting that one part in the classic Joy To The World. Now, if she included the verses from Three Dog Night's song, there would be a problem! Yes, I am a Christian and I honestly see nothing wrong with just incorporating that one little part into the song that just makes it more unique! O Holy Night is by far the best song ever and Mariah's version could never be topped!! Mariah truly has the voice of an angel!!! I also like the remix of All I Want For Christmas that has a mix of hip-hop and R&B. This CD is definitely something I will be listening to forever! The bonus track, that was included on the import of Merry Christmas, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is awesome, I love Mariah's version!<br /><br />I love this whole CD from beginning to end, all 10 or 11 tracks, depending on which CD it is, over and over again and never get bored!! I love how on O Holy Night, she uses all her octaves and hits that really high note at the very end of the song, it really makes Mariah the best of all time!!! I love Mariah and always will!!!am, hear Mariah's Joy To The World and his words exactly were \\"This is a drinking song\\" and I was like, this is NOT a drinking song!!

B000683VI4|4.0|I rented this movie and then purchased it used from Amazon.  Overall, I loved it.  Ryan and Rachel were EXCELLENT and the story really moved me (have watched it 3 times total, including once with Nick Cassavettes commentary).  Also, the many \\"special features\\" make it a price bargain.  However, the movie has one serious drawback for me.  I don't think James Garner was the right choice for the older Noah.  Don't get me wrong, he is a fabulous actor and did a very good job--but I never believed he was the same character as Ryan Gosling.  They look nothing alike and if we are supposed to believe in a movie, it has to at least seem feasible.  Another problem I had with Garner is that he is so well known to me, that I kept thinking of Maverick and Jim Rockford and that made it impossible to believe he was Noah.  I thought Nick Cassavettes had another wonderful actor and a much better choice for this part right under his nose in Sam Shepard.  Instead of giving this also great actor the tiny role of Noah's father, he should have been the one to play the older Noah.  On the contrary, I did think that Gena was believable as the older Ali and she did a fabulous job, too.  Another problem for me was that the photos in the album at the end should have been of Ryan and Rachel since the audience just spend 2 hours seeing THEM as the young Noah and Ali. <br /> <br />I don't want to seem too critical, because I did love much of the movie and overall, I would recommend it. However, I feel it was almost perfect when it could have been completely perfect.  Sorry, Jim, sorry Nick.
B0006399FS|5.0|Album: How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb<br /><br />Artist: U2<br /><br />Simple: Don't build one. That's the best way to dismantle an atomic bomb. I didn't come up with that (I read it in another review). Yes, I know this album came out a long time ago (in the music buiness last Thanksgiving may as well be forever ago) but it's taken me a really long time to ponder HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB (HTDAB). First, let me say that while I love it when band's experiment....thank God U2's mid-life crisis is over and they've returned to their roots. Both this album and their previous effort, ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND find U2 leaving behind the dark, noisy Euro-Disco scene and returning to arena rock (where they belong). HTDAB is fab...and U2 lets you know right off the bat with \\"Vertigo\\" a gee-whizzbang homerun/grandslam of a song. Yeah, so what if Apple and Clear Channel have run it into the ground? They were able to do so because it kicks so much ass! Bono and company wisely slow things down with the second (artier) track \\"Miracle Drug.\\" I personally found it to be my least favorite track, but this could be caused by an acute adrenaline overdose left over from \\"Vertigo.\\" The third track, \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" is the soul brother of ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND's \\"Kite.\\" Both songs sprang from Bono's adult relationship with his dead. Whereas \\"Kite\\" was about  moving out, \\"Sometimes...\\" is about moving on (after the death of a loved one). The song is truthful and moving. Bono's gift for laying his feelings all out for everyone to see in this song will silence critics who accuse him of pandering and being a sell-out. No one sells out by writing a song like \\"Sometimes...\\" Next, \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is a noisy, post-Pop manifesto for peace (by making threats). This song seems like a statement to those super activists who end up becoming the very thing they are fighting. Peace, should be born of love-not frustration and anger. If \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" were a road, \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" would be the destination. This song is classic U2, and is one of the stongest tracks. I love Edge's guitar work (his songs are always so fresh and unique). The song also has my favorite lyrics on the album \\"the more see the less you know/ the less you find out as you go\\" only a mature, world-weary Bono could write a universal truth like that (and sing it with such conviction...so much that my 21 year old ears automatically take the statement as fact rather than opinion). \\"All Because of You\\" another great single, is well...a great single. Not as fast as or furious as \\"Vertigo\\" but it's not meant to be-it's a great U2 love song. Speaking of love songs, \\"Man and a Woman\\" the next track is probably the best 'I don't understand love' song written. Totally encapsulating the whole 'what the hell is going on here' feeling of man and woman's relationships, the song features some great guitar work and brilliant chorus.\\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" sounds like vintage U2, again the chorus is strong (the 'cool down mama' will stick inside your head for days). The album's weakest track is stuck down there at the bottom (where an album's weakest track belongs). The song, \\"One Step Closer\\" isn't really bad, just not very memorable and seems like a U2 song we've already heard. \\"Origin of the Species\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" close HTDAB, on a uplifting-hopefull note.  The spiritual side we've all come to expect from U2 rears it head, and unlike many political bands, keeps from being preachy (while still making it's point).  \\"Yahweh\\" alone is worth the purchase price of the CD (I think). A love letter to God...the song will break your heart with it's 'always pain before a child is born' chorus and humble before-the-universe lyrics.  I love this album, and the band who made it. Many might dismiss U2 as a Dinosaur of the '80s, a relic still trying to cash in on their essential rock classic THE JOSHUA TREE-but HTDAB is proof positive that U2 tough (butwilling to wear their hearts on their sleeves). I was, however, a bit dissapointed that the album didn't really seem to touch 9/11 or the War on Terror (I desperately wanted U2 to tell me everything was going to be okay). Upon further consideration, I realized that any attempt to do so would be an act of futility-also songs of healing and hope (like \\"Yahweh\\") are more in line with what this world needs right now (not \\"The Angry American\\").(but willing to wear their hearts on their sleeves).

B00005JKC3|4.0|Even as a kid, BEFORE I started reading comics, I understood that the old Bixby/Ferrigno show was very different from the comic.  Isn't it obvious that the Ferrigno Hulk was the way he was because CBS couldn't afford to have him fighting the army during the late 70's?  This movie was based on the original source material and is a more accurate protrayal of the character. <br /> <br />Not that I didn't enjoy the old T. V. show (it's still one of my favorites) but as another reviewer pointed out, this movie is NOT a remake of the T. V. show!  Stop it!  I think you should all read a few of the comic books (from the early 1980s by Mantlo and Buscema) and watch this movie again. <br /> <br />As a major Hulk fan, I was very pleased with this film.  I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it would've been improved by adding more Hulk scenes (he's the very reason that I paid my money to see it, after all) and making the ending battle less abstract.

I also like the remix of All I Want For Christmas that has a mix of hip-hop and R&B. This CD is definitely something I will be listening to forever! The bonus track, that was included on the import of Merry Christmas, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is awesome, I love Mariah's version!<br /><br />I love this whole CD from beginning to end, all 10 or 11 tracks, depending on which CD it is, over and over again and never get bored!! I love how on O Holy Night, she uses all her octaves and hits that really high note at the very end of the song, it really makes Mariah the best of all time!!! I love Mariah and always will!!!am, hear Mariah's Joy To The World and his words exactly were \\"This is a drinking song\\" and I was like, this is NOT a drinking song!! I don't take things like that seriously because I know Mariah meant no harm to include those few lyrics which also has all three real Joy To The World verses in it, it just made the song more unique and I love it!! Besides, the part \\"Joy To The World, All The Boys And Girls\\" fits Christmas perfectly, there's nothing wrong with putting that one part in the classic Joy To The World. Now, if she included the verses from Three Dog Night's song, there would be a problem! Yes, I am a Christian and I honestly see nothing wrong with just incorporating that one little part into the song that just makes it more unique! O Holy Night is by far the best song ever and Mariah's version could never be topped!! Mariah truly has the voice of an angel!!!

B00005QIPH|3.0|it's tough to listen to this album straight-through, because there's not enough variety between the tracks.  i suppose that's why the album isn't any longer than it is.  i think the album would be a lot better if it were shorter <br /> <br />most of the tracks on this album are mediocre, having one or two great, catchy guitar parts and/or really awesome singing parts.  the big exceptions, though, are the first two songs \\"is this it?\\" and \\"the modern age\\", which are entirely excellent and offer more than most modern bands which don't even have one entirely excellent song <br /> <br />\\"someday\\" and \\"last nite\\" are pretty darn good, too.   <br /> <br />other highlights of this album: <br /> <br />\\"ah!  hehe, i meant AH!  hehe, no i didn't mean that at all.\\"  lmao; wow, pure genius <br /> <br />stupid, obvious, yet entirely catchy choruses such as \\"new york city clubs!  new york city clubs!..\\" <br /> <br />and parts where he goes entirely energetically crazy

6305308659|5.0|I remember watching the commercials for \\"Pleasantville\\" when it first came out in theaters, and thinking it might be good, but that it looked kind of gimmicky.  I don't usually like movies where the special effects take over the whole story.  But, when a very dear friend of mine recommended \\"Pleasantville\\" to me, I decided to rent it.  I was totally blown away!!!!  I understood the need to make the town of Pleasantville black and white and why the people and surroundings turned into color.  The aspect of kids changing into color after having sex didn't really bother me (even though I am very conservative when it comes to my views on premarital sex) because I feel the writer used sex as a metaphor for experiencing life.  I really dug it when the main characters (David/Bud and Jennifer/Mary Sue) did not change color when they had sex.  For them, the change had to be about something even more profound. All of the actors did a spectacular job, but since I am a big Tobey Maguire fan, I felt his performance stood out.  William H. Macy was also excellent as the dad.  In short, \\"Pleasantville\\" was a life-changing movie that reinforced my belief in being true to yourself, the importance of individuality, and the truth that not all of life's experiences are black and white (forgive me for using an idiom that has been overused in regards to this movie!).
B00079ZACM|5.0|Back in 1939 aged 13 on holiday in Wales my parents took me to the cinema to see 'Four Feathers'. I was enthralled by the location and the acting and from that day the film became and still is my favourite. By 1945 I was serving my National Service and in December we embarked on the troop ship 'Strathmore' destination unknown. Off we sailed across The Bay of Biscay into the Med, a brief stop at Malta, on to Port Said through the Suez Canal where they announced our destination.....Khartoum.<br /><br />And so I visited the scenes of my favourite film where I stayed until November 1947. In those days the Sudan and its people was a very friendly place so it saddens me to read of the long and bitter struggles that have existed there to this day.<br /><br />Naturally whenevr 'Four Feathers ' is shown on TV it is a must for me and always will be. Wonderful colour,scenery,acting and a real 'Boys Own' adventure story. No swearing, no sex and no special effects.<br /><br />Ken Vellam  71 Palm Court Westgate on Sea kent England
B00006GFAB|5.0|To many, they were 1970s' hard rock legends who wore lots of makeups and made loud music to make your parents go beserk. But remove the eyeshadow and other nonessential elements, Kiss were serious musicians who never failed to deliver. Now, 30 years after they first burst onto the scene, their music still speaks to a generation of kids who just want to rock and roll all nite and party everyday.<br /><br />That being said, \\"The Very Best Of Kiss\\" features all of the major Kiss classics from 1974 to 1992, including big hits as well as popular album tracks.<br /><br />Kiss made their first assault in 1974 with their self titled debut album. Though it didn't sell very well, it developed a massive following for the band and yielding the album rock smashes \\"Strutter\\", which to me has one of the all time greatest riffs ever, and \\"Deuce\\".<br /><br />They steadily built up their fan base with their next two albums, \\"Got To Choose\\" and \\"Hotter Than Hell\\", represented here by \\"Got To Choose\\", \\"Hotter...'s\\" title track and \\"C'Mon And Love Me\\".<br /><br />By 1975, they were big enough to release their first of about five live albums. The album, \\"Alive\\", shot into the top ten and yileded their breakthrough hit (and signature song) in the top twenty single \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\". Kiss were officially on the map.<br /><br />1976's \\"Destroyer\\" became their biggest selling album yet and gave them their first top ten hit in the ballad \\"Beth\\", a sweet ballad that was a major departure for the band: instead of a loud, guitar driven rocker, it was a tender, soft piano ballad. Also from that album is \\"Detroit Rock City\\" (which lent its name to a really crappy movie) and \\"Shout It Out Loud\\".<br /><br />1976's second Kiss album, \\"Rock And Roll Over\\" was another success, yielding two top twenty hits in the tender acoustic ballad \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" and the raucous \\"Calling Dr. Love\\". Also from that album is the raunchy \\"I Want You\\", which starts off as tender song than explodes in your face as an all out rocker.<br /><br />1977's \\"Love Gun\\" sold well, but failed to yield a major hit. However, the album's biggest hit, the 1950s' - style pedophilic ode \\"Christine Sixteen\\" (a personal favorite) is included, as well as the title track (which I was never really a fan of).<br /><br />1978 found Kiss at the height of their popularity. That was the year when all four members (Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons, Peter Criss and Paul Stanley) released their own solo albums. Simmons' did the best on the album charts, but only Frehley's was the only one that yielded a hit single. \\"New York Groove\\" was a top twenty hit that is a truue classic, and it enjoyed a rightful resurgance of popularity when it was used those post - 9/11 \\"I Love New York\\" ads.<br /><br />1979's \\"Dynasty\\" continued their platinum streak, yielding the top twenty foray into disco, \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\", which had the traditional disco beat but stayed true to the band's rock roots. The album may have been panned, but this song is awesome.<br /><br />Three years are skipped when we get to \\"I Love It Loud\\", an awesome heavy metal song with a great false fade out. \\"Lick It Up\\" is a very underrated number that I tend to like.<br /><br />1989's \\"Hot In The Shade\\" yielded the top ten, Michael Bolton - penned smash power ballad \\"Forever\\", a beautiful song and their biggest hit since \\"Beth\\". Closing this album is the fantastic \\"God Gave Rock & Roll To You II\\".<br /><br />This is truly a great album. Definitely a must for any music fan. Buy it as soon as possible.well, but failed to yield a major hit.

B0002OERI0|5.0|When I heard the Grammy nominations for last year, I had not heard American idiot and thought, \\"Surely none of these other albums can top (Kanye West's) College Dropout.\\" I was wrong. Whereas Ray Charles' Genius Loves Company is a GOOD album, Diary of Alicia Keys is a better one with that tops its genre, and Usher's Confessions is a few notches below Alicia Keys as a little bit better than average R&B album that should not have been nominated, Green Day's American Idiot is the crowning achievement of Green Day's career and one of the best albums I have ever heard. I have always enjoyed Green Day, but they have never been one of my favorite bands. Most of my favorite artists are classic rock bands and Hip Hop legends. However, this album echoes many of those classic rock bands I love with its storytelling, harmonies, melodies, and flat-out great songs. And while each song packs its own punch and has its own specialty to it, it is the album as a whole that lifts the listener to an intoxicated experience. But since it's fun, I'll break down each song: <br /> <br />American Idiot - 4/5 - This song has grown on me with each listen. While I at first thought it was a standard Green Day punk song, I have since discovered its rich melody and well-stated message of rebellion. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia - 5/5 - This 5-part epic track is simply genius. Who can't relate to the disillusionment in the lyrics and appreciate the beautiful last part of the cycle, \\"Tales From Another Broken Home?\\" <br /> <br />Holiday - 5/5 - An aggressive, scathing attack on our president and his administration that reflects and improves on the best of the Clash. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams - 5/5 - When I first heard this song on the radio before I bought the album I thought, \\"That sounds like Billy Joe Armstrong, but surely this isn't Green Day...but it's damn good!\\" I was wrong, and it is better than damn good. A classic track. <br /> <br />Are We The Waiting - 5/5 - The anthemic chorus, the deep sense of loneliness and isolation, the awesome lyrics - what's not to love? <br /> <br />St. Jimmy - 4/5 - One of the lesser songs on the album, but still cool as Hell. He is an intriguing character that speaks for many of his American peers. <br /> <br />Novacaine - 4.5/5 - This song is powerfully personal to me, since I am a recovering addict/alcoholic, and the song's focal point is escape from the pain of life and our personal demons. <br /> <br />She's A Rebel - 3.5/5 - The worst song on the album, and still better than 90% of modern rock and pop/punk. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl - 5/5 - A heartbreaking appreciation of a crushed girl who deserves more than she's gotten. The eastern-tinged melody haunts me not just during, but also after each listen. <br /> <br />Letterbomb - 4.5/5 - Once again, awesome melody, awesome song concept. <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends - 5/5 - If I could give this songs more than 5 stars I would. It tears my heart out every time I hear it, but I still can't help but listen to it anyway. My far and away favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />Homecoming - 5/5 - The 2nd 5-part, 9 minute song cycle on the album, this one I consider the superior one. And, once again, it's depressing and sad, but moves me and gives me hope at the same time. <br /> <br />Whatsername - 5/5 - 4 minutes of sheer beauty. An amazing melody that is only surpassed by the combination of itself with the song's lyrics. <br /> <br />I can't say much more. Listen to the album. If it doesn't move you, either check your pulse or stick to Jessica Simpson music.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Tom Waits is a musical genius hands down. He keeps working beyond what so many expect and it pays off. I have been a big fan of his since I picked up \\"Blue Valentine\\" and the immensely loved \\"Rain Dogs\\". His music is straight, laid down, laid back, beat poetry, and it should be enjoyed by everyone. Some cannot get over his voice and how it seems to get grittier with each recording but on this one people should not complain. \\"Get Behind The Mule\\" has one of the greatest first lines ever. \\"Chocolate Jesus\\" is catchy in a way that cannot be explained. And, of course, my personal favorite is the beat bumping, harmonica toned \\"Filipino Box Spring Hog\\". Even if it wasn't on this I would have still enjoyed it nonetheless. (I now wonder, is he really big in japan?)
6300182150|4.0|To me this movie was more than just a comedy, it was my life. A virtual biography about me, and for me. My college dorm was similar in fact to the Delta's, but enough about me. John Belushi made me gag because I was laughing so hard at his faces and his poor hygene. The humor is so utterly tasteless that it actually works very tastefully. This movie is definately not for everyone, but if you're in college and you still have a little space for humor in your life, then there's no reason not to see this.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Rod Stewart has been a consistently amazing live performer since the 1970s', but this concert at the Royal Albert Hall may be the single greatest performance of his career. Never have I seen such a consistently entertaining live dvd, with great sound and camera work to boot.<br /><br />Featuring 17 breathtaking Rod classics, this dvd never fails to deliver. Whether he's wailing his way through to \\"Stay With Me\\", pouring his heart into \\"You're In My Heart\\", crooning out the timeless \\"American Songbook\\" tracks or showing his tender side on \\"I Don't Wanna Talk About It\\" (sung with a brand new singing talent discocvered by Rod, Amy Belle).<br /><br />The whole dvd is a highlight as a whole, but forced to pick one performance as the dvd's high point, I would have to go for \\"Hot Legs\\". Rod just rocks the hell out of this one, proving that even at 60 he still hasn't lost his youthful energy. My only wish is that he performed \\"Some Guys Have All The Luck\\" and \\"Addicted To Love\\" separately. They're great as a medley, but I feel they'd work even better on their own.<br /><br />Overall, a stunning live performance that only a performer like Rod can provide. My advice is to go out and buy this amazing dvd.
B00005JNTV|4.0|No one, it would seem, has worked as hard or received more satisfaction and dedication out of his work within the movie industry then Robert Rodriguez. Starting off with a seven thousand dollar budget and a camera in hand, El Mariachi sparked the career of one of the most imaginative and sought after directors of our generation. He has not only taken up the responsibility of directing and writing the script for each of his films, but he has also acted as the composer, visual supervisor, editor, producer, production designer, and sound editor for several of them as well. Furthermore, not a single one of his films, including the visually complex and celebrity laden Sin City, was made for more then forty-million dollars, virtually unheard of in the modern Hollywood environment of one-hundred million dollars being the average price for a tent-pole project. Truly, Robert Rodriguez is a rogue of the film industry and his audience would not have it any other way. <br /> <br />The story for Sin City not only meticulously blends seemingly individual plotlines together into a single cohesive feature film, but it also resonates the very characteristics that have made the film-noir genre so enticing and appealing to movie-goers over the years. More importantly, the script emphasizes a sad truth of life, which is that certain circumstances require morally corrupt individuals to put a stop to even more morally corrupt individuals from doing harm onto others. Sadly, unlike Superman and Spider-Man, not all comic-book heroes are as ethically heroic as would be believed. The only visible complexities within the script were the transition of one story arch to the next, which should have transferred more smoothly then it did, and the lack of connection in terms of intertwining characters and subplots between the three stories. It could have been more compelling and interesting had Rodriguez and Miller found a way to better blend the three separate storylines together, integrating several of the characters into blended scenes, more then the mere glimpse we receive of Marv in the bar that Hartigan steps into to search for Nancy, but it works fine enough as it stands. <br /> <br />In spite of his appearance in numerous television productions since 1989, only in the last few years has British performer Clive Owen received recognition in Hollywood having been offered the leading role in the Jerry Bruckheimer production, King Arthur, and his Academy Award-nominated performance in Closer. Owen truly accentuates the role of Dwight, a rogue out to stop Jack Rafferty, performed by Benicio Del Toro, from harming the hookers of Old Towne, and his somber voice-over narration of the events depicted, typical of the film-noir genre, adds to the entertainment value. Del Toro's Jack Rafferty is the type of character which the audience would care to have a little more background information on in order to firmly grasp the concept of what is taking place in several scenes, but perhaps that is too much involvement then is required for some people. <br /> <br />Mickey Rourke, a name of whom few within the current generation of young adult movie-goers would recall hearing before, has been long overdue for a comeback performance, appearing in The Rainmaker and The Thin Red Line, and he more then makes up for the string of commercial failures on his resume in the role of Marv. Observing his magnetic performance onscreen, it was as if Frank Miller, creator of the Sin City graphic comic series, created the figure of Marv specifically for Mickey Rourke, it is that comprehensive and enthralling. Though not the fault of the scriptwriting team, Jaimie King receives the short end of the performance stick in the role of Goldie given as how she dies within the first few minutes we see of her and even when she returns as Wendy, Goldie's twin sister, she doesn't do much beyond a few scenes with Rourke. And who better to fill the role of the silent and deadly cannibalistic assassin,Kevin, a young psychopath enlisted by the corrupt governmental structure of Sin City to kill off Goldie and pin the crime on Marv, then Elijah Wood? Was there honestly no one else within the same height structure as Wood that would have served as effectively in this role as he did? This is not meant to discredit his performance by any means. On the contrary, Wood turns what could have easily been an unintentionally derisive character into one of the most enigmatical and haunting figures in the film. The problem lies in the fact that when the audience sees Wood they automatically recall his performance as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Ring trilogy and the effect his character is suppose to have on them goes down a slight notch or two because of this. <br /> <br />Jessica Alba, better known for her involvement in the short-lived James Cameron television series, Dark Angel, on Fox, is stunning to say the least about her in the role of Nancy Callahan, the young potential rape victim who grows up to be a strong-willed exotic dancer. And while it is still a little early to make a judgment call as to whether she will have a longstanding career in the film industry seeing as how her role is limited to the `damsel in distress' caricature familiar to the film-noir genre, her performance holds up quite well opposite veteran actor Bruce Willis. Willis plays up the role of John Hartigan, quite possibly the only honest cop in the Sin City police force, with gusto, as he had done in such other gritty dramas as Pulp Fiction and Twelve Monkeys. It was fascinating to see the relationship which existed between Nancy Callahan and John Hartigan develop into a chivalrous `knight on a white horse riding to the rescue of his fair maiden in distress' love affair onscreen. And though this will certainly receive some negative feed back from some audience members, this in a way represents a double-standard in our society. Headlined prominently in such risqu comedies as Sex in the City aswell as in those insufferable tabloid newsmagazines, Mr. Willis being one of their more recent targets, is the belief that older women chasing after young men for sexual pleasure is perfectly acceptable while relationships which exist between older men and younger women is repulsive and depraved. Though this type of behavior may not exactly be everyone's cup of tea, there is certainly nothing morally objectionable to it given that it is for a loving relationship and not merely sexual intimacy alone and our society must comes to terms with this fact. Sure, it would have been nice for Rodriguez or Miller to have provided the audience with a bit more information concerning the previous sexual attacks made by Junior against young little girls in order to receive a better idea on the type of character that is being dealt with, but it is understandable enough that it is not required. In any event, Nick Stahl gives a decent, if not limited, performance in the role of the senator's son, eventually evolving into the monster known as the Yellow Bastard. Unfortunately, this thus mentioned character leaves several questions unanswered. Why did he become yellow? What is the cause of this horrible smell emulating from the bastard which is repeatedly mentioned by either Hartigan or others? Yes, these are minor, if not trivial, matters but when it comes to a feature this imaginative, nitpicking is going to be a result. <br /> <br />Overall, in spite of its failure to emphasize a canonical point within its script, Sin City is nonetheless nothing short of visually arresting entertainment in the best sense of the word and serves as one of the more innovative feature film projects to crawl out of the works in recent years. Truly stunning in terms of its scope, direction, and graphic style, which is balanced out thanks to the exceptionally amplified performances of its cast members and the pertinent dialogue throughout the two-hour movie. As marveling as this presentation turned out tobe, it should be noted that there were some, albeit trivial in respects, minor complaints to be made. Rodriguez and Miller had a captivating concept going when Marv discussed through narration how he was confused within his mind as to whether the actions he was taking were that of a justifiable avenger of his lover's death or merely the aspirations of a psychopathic killer everyone said he would be come to life, but instead is only focused on briefly before being lost in the shuffle. It would have been interesting to see what may have developed had this been expanded on in the script. And though the violence featured in Sin City is meant to be comical in nature, visualize it alone the lines as the fight sequences seen in Kill Bill Vol. 1, and not to be taken seriously, there were particular scenes in which it was too over the top to be taken seriously. For example, the scene in which Benicio Del Toro's Jack Rafferty had not only his hand cut off but also has his gun backfire into his forehead and has his head cut `like a Pez dispenser', went a little too far it seems and should have been cut down more cleanly. There is no problem with violence being featured prominently in live-action adult movies, but should it merely be violence for the sake of being violence, it doesn't make sense for the film to bite off more then it can chew. Still, the black and white visual quality of the film spliced with hints of iridescence, the scintillating reverberation of rain in the dark night of the back alleys, passionate and harrowing tales of chivalrous love affairs, and plenty of vital fluids and savagery to satisfy even the most hardcore of Taratino fanatics, are reasons enough to resurrect the hopes of movie-goers disillusioned over the years by the stale and unoriginal presentations and hoard them back to the local Cineplex in droves.
B00008YJH5|5.0|Surfer Rosa is the first Pixies cd that I bought and I was not disappointed. People suggested that I buy Come On Pilgrim but I opted to buy this because of hearing a sample of Cactus. The following is a review of the songs themselves individually.---- <br /> <br />1.Bone Machine-A great opener, establishing surfer rock while still alerting the listener of an oncoming onslaught of grunge in the future. <br />2.Break My Body-Great vocals between Kim and Frank. He's a belly dancer. That's just great. <br />3.Something Against You-Very surfer-like with a punk edge. <br />4.Broken Face-My fave song off this cd. Pure fast grunge. Lovely. <br />5.Gigantic-A song by Kim Deal that is so Breeders-like that it's creepy. Still great though. <br />6.River Euphrates-This song is why some people call them art/experimental. <br />7.Where Is My Mind?-By far one of the two most popular songs off this recording. If you listen to it you can tell how much they have influenced bands over the years. <br />8.Cactus-So f-ed up it's amazing. <br />9.Tony's Theme-This is a song about a superhero named Tony and it's called Tony's theme. <br />10.Oh My Golly!-That's what I said. <br />11.Vamos-The other most popular song here. Kurt Cobain was so into this and you can tell. <br />12.I'm Amazed-\\"It was like so hush-hush...\\" <br />13.Brick Is Red-Amazing guitar intro. Great way to sign out. Great hooks.
B00005221L|4.0|This film delivers. I enjoyed almost every minute of it, and of course enjoyed Arnie and his smashing one-liners. The film starts out with a platoon in the South American jungle tracking down a group of ruthless guerillas. They find a few fellow soldiers brutally skinned and murdered, but what human could have done this? They soon find that their answer is none, but a virtually invisible alien with some heat thermos for eyes and a red laser that blows people up. The finale is as exciting as it is brutal, we get to see the ugly alien up close and personal, and there is a thrilling final showdown between Arnie and the Predator. This movie was fun for me, although it takes a little while to get to the alien stuff, its still fun and gruesome. It is a land version of Alien all the way, and in fact its so similar that I thought at first it was a remake of Alien in some way. Its a good thing that this movie is alot better than any remake...
B000059QYB|5.0|Given that today's punk music comes in the form of non taleneted bands such as Green Day and Good Charlotte, many people will forget that back in the 1980s' and early 1990s', punk music actually meant something. It was used as music you could play to get stuff of your chest and have a good time, and not to rant and rave about the president (Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\", which they truly are) or the paparazzi (\\"I Just Wanna Live\\").<br /><br />That being said, no original punk rocker rocked harder than Billy Idol. Sure, his songs were loud, raunchy and full of rage, not to mention completely different from anything elese on the radio at the time, but they also carried a pop sensibility that made Idol's music accessible and enabled him to fire off a huge string of hit singles between 1983 and 1990.<br /><br />\\"Greatest Hits\\" has all of Idol's best known songs - \\"Dancing With Myself\\", \\"Mony Mony\\", \\"White Wedding\\", the creepy \\"Eyes Without A Face\\", \\"To Be A Lover\\" and my all time favorite, \\"Cradle Of Love\\" (which had a great video), to name a few. Added to this stunning list of 1980s' classics are lesser known tracks such as \\"Catch My Fall\\", \\"Don't Need A Gun\\", \\"Shock To The System\\" (the only track from 1993's debacle \\"Cybepunk\\"), \\"Flesh For Fantasy\\", the cover of \\"L.A. Woman\\" and the forgotten top 20 hit \\"Sweet Sixteen\\".<br /><br />Also included is a new recording from Idol (whose last album was 1993's \\"Cyberpunk\\"). Ironically, it's a cover of \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\". The reason this song is so ironic for Billy to record is becasue most of the world has forgotten about Billy.<br /><br />This is one of the rare perfect best of's ever. Also, pick up Billy's new studio album, \\"Devil's Playground\\". I haven't heard it but it's suppoed to be really good.
B00005A46T|5.0|This is awesome. Heavier than S/T and Volume 3. its probably the best album
B000002AP1|5.0|Raw Power is one of the Stooges craziest albums, and Iggy Pop did a good job updating David Bowie's version. Search and Destroy, the opener song, is my favorite. The closing Death Trip is a good song that lasts for a long time. The Stooges had a big influence on punk bands like the Damned and Dead Boys who covered their songs.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is a movie that confused me a bit as a child, but upon viewing it another time, I couldn't get enough of it. If you're an action fan, then this movie has everting. Great one-liners, car chases, fights, and murder and futuristic mayhem. In 1984, two men[Michael Biehn and Schwarzennegar] appear out of nowhere, both are from the future, and both have one goal, find Sarah Connor. This is Arnie's best role still to date, although he doesn't talk much. He starts out the movie with a bang, naked in kicking some street punk's asses, and stealing their clothes in the process. He proceeds to find as much ammo as possible, and track down Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton. Hamilton delivers a good performance as a young woman frightened out of her wits. Director James Cameron does an excellent job putting the film together, and I found it hard to believe that this was only his second Hollywood film. Its a fun, suspenseful movie to watch!
B00005JNTV|4.0|This movie is too incredible to describe, to vivid to even detail, the feel of a graphic novel come to life. Robbie Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarrantino have created another \\"Pulp Fiction\\", and broke the mold with some actors. <br /> <br />For how is one to take a loving sweet hobbit, who is.... cannibalistic ninja. Elijah Woods is super twisted in this movie.  <br /> <br />The women were as strong as the men, and the men as evil as cold black hell. There were no heroes, there were no villains, it was a group of people who had their agendas.  <br /> <br />Why not five stars? Because Michael Madsen, and Bruce Willis were dialing in their performances. Mikey Rourke? Rutger Hauer? WELL DONE!  <br /> <br />As to the femme fatales? Oh My!  <br /> <br />
B00007BHOE|5.0|This DVD is truly insane. great for any Slipknot fan and even if you arent get it cause its so amazing. Great heavy music as well. AWESOME
B000667FN8|1.0|It's amazing how music like this can be so credited and popular even though sp have a large fan base. While on the topic of there fan base, it is worthy to note that this music cannot appeal to ne one ecxcept ppl who are between 13 to 15 yer old. The lyrics are really plain and even an 8 year old could write such stuff which is inspired by small teenage problems such as bad relationships and controlling parents. To be homest i bleve that sp has a decent sound and could really have done much more with there music if they were able to dig deeper and write good inspired songs. I dont think they wud even know some of the more serious problems that most teenagers go thru. Having heard a good amount of this album on my 15 year old sisters cd player i cant say much that wud make sp seem like a good band in general let alone a good punk rock band.
B000067IZ3|4.0|I must commend Steven Soderbergh for making Traffic as it depicts the drug war in all of its truly gray dimensions.  No where is this more true than when drug Czar, Michael Douglas, calls for some original \\"out of the box\\" ideas on his government plane and none of his staff can offer up a thing.  It really was a very ambitious project and I believe that the director pulled it off admirably. The movie is quite stylish and it was a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Everything involving Mexico was absolutely fascinating.  I thought the shots of Mexico City and Tijuana were highly authentic.  Frankly, I think that Benicio Del Toro is far and away the best part of the movie.  His character outshines everyone else although Don Cheadle had an inspired performance. The intrigue between the cartels was the best part.<br /><br />Sadly, there was considerable racism in the film which is to be expected from Hollywood nowadays.  The Hispanic and black cops are shown saying they want to catch the big guys, \\"the white guys,\\" even though both of the big shots in the movie are \\"Hispanic guys.\\"  No matter, they'll blame the white man.  Then, through the speech of a drug addicted spoiled private school kid, we find out that whites are to blame for blacks selling drugs.  One wonders who is to blame for whites selling drugs then.  It is the familiar, and mindless, politically correct view that whites are the cause of all evil, whereas, non-whites are always innocent victims.  By proffering this the filmmaker, just as the case is with every trendy PC acolyte, reveals his own racism, as he condescends to minorities instead of treating them as real people.  The racist element lowered my overall rating but the movie was still worthwhile.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|I LIKE THIUS MOVIE ALOT. I HANVE  NOT SEEN THE IMAX VERSION. IF YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE GET IT
B00005UK1F|4.0|I bought this album after reading all the rave reviews about it at amazon.com and progreviews.com. After listening to it for about a half-a-dozen times, I can say that I am satisfied overall, but I do have some minor quibbles. Let's take a look at the positives first.<br /><br />First of all, I am an ardent fan of (old) Metallica, Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, and (the softer side of) Opeth, and I was delighted to see influences of all these bands (and then some) on this album. In fact, this album sucessfully fuses crunchy riffs typical of Metallica and Iron Maiden, the epic grandeur typical of Dream Theater, the melodic yet heavy sadness of Opeth, and the plain weirdness of Pink Floyd in their heyday, into something that flows transparently from one part into another. (Actually, I felt a little bit disturbed about a riff around 16:20 that sounded like it was lifted right off some Metallica song - I could be wrong, so pardon me if I am mistaken). There are also a few \\"deathy\\" vocals but they are very well executed and blend very well with the background.<br /><br />The only negative aspect that I came across on this album (track ?) are a few *brief* sections in the middle that I could only classify as \\"cliched metal riffage\\". Also, I had mixed feelings about the female vocal section in the middle (there is something about it that feels a little \\"forced\\"). Anyways, most of my opinions are subjective (last time I heard, musical taste is subjective) and hence you might like this album more or less than I did. But when it comes to musicianship and songwriting alone, any open-minded music fan will feel satisfied with this ambitious effort. And Oh, I did get a kick out of seeing my CD track timer cross the 60:00 mark for the first time ever :-)
0156012197|5.0|One of the fondest memories of my life was reading The Little Prince in the 5th grade. This book was the best description i had ever read of what was truly important in life. It answerd all of my questions as to why adults sooner or later stop \\"believing\\"... i love the little prince with all of my heart.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I was skeptical about this film before renting it. I was hoping it wouldn't be one of those \\"wow so many big names starring in such a small film that everybody has to see. Bloaded with critics reviews of adoration\\". I was wrong as Closer was a beautiful representation of the selfish and greedy aspects of humaity. <br />     When i was finished watching it i felt utter contempt for Owen but also utter admiration for him and Portman. Jude Law and Julia Roberts were both quite good in this film but the other two made this film even better.  <br />     From the opening scene paved way by Damien Rice's beautiful song to well.... the closing scene featuring the afformentioned Blower's Daughter, I was captivated.  <br />     I was content without any sex scenes, as the way sex was described by the characters would surpass any sex scene if in the film. This was the brilliance of the dialogue, there were moments where it is gentle and loving and in a split second it turns to harsh and coarse. <br />     Yes, in a movie where there is a pivitol plot point about Portman's character's name it is kind of ridiculous that you don't find out their names until a ways into the movie. But I believe it shows how in love they were and how much they know nothing of love(a reference to the affairs in the movie). <br />     I realize that these characters are an exaggeration of any real person, but thats what makes this film so brilliant. These characters celebrate the worst in people, and really show the consequences of cheating. It is hard to believe that these characters care for each other after sleeping with others. They cheat and cheat, but yet they still love each other? To understand these characters is to understand love and it's affects on people. The movie left it up to you to draw your final conclusions about why they did what they did.  <br />     The dialogue in Closer will probaly seem contrived and ridiculous to some people. But if you understood the film then you willunderstand just how great the script really is. They say all these things, they proclaim love but yet don't understand what they are saying. This is the beauty of the dialogue. Many people believe this film is about why and how people love one another but to me it was about what is love and why people want it. <br />     I wouldn't call this film a romance as after viewing it, you would not like to link Closer to any aspects of your relationship.  <br />     It was great to see Ms. Romantic Comedy, Julia Roberts playing someone who was the complete opposite of the archetype she was crowned queen of. These characters are horrible and miserable people who deserve eachother. I think they should stay together to keep their lies and schemes focused on each other, and not spread to everyone else.  <br />     This movie definately is not for everyone. I could understand people being put off by some aspects of the fim technical or not. I suggest couples watch this movie who suspect their loved ones of cheating on them as a deterent. Great from start to finish, definately worth seeing.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Team America is, absolutely, one of the funniest things I have ever witnessed in my entire life. After approximately a third of the way through the movie, I started worrying that my throat would swell from laughter, my spleen would rupture and urine would begin to spill. The first time anyway. The second time was just a regular funny movie. I'll probably wait a little while before I watch it again, but I definitely will be a Team America watching old nostalgia seeking fart past the quarter of this millenium.
B000002JAX|5.0|Before I purchased this album I read a review that criciticized some of the instrument choices and orchestration of some of the tunes, particularly \\"Walking After Midnight\\", but after having listened to the album for a couple of months, I've found that it has grown on me and I am partcicularly impressed by the singer's nuances in her performance.  I agree that the instrumentation is unconventional almost throughout, but that's the type of creativity I've come to appreciate.  I look forward to Madeleine's next album.  I think this one has demonstrated a truly rare talent that will only get better with maturity.  In terms of talent and musically, she reminds me of Ella Fitzgerald.
B0007Y08I8|5.0|Trey Paker & Matt Stone are the most talented people when it comes to the animated satire. They are the Monty Python of the animation world. Love them :-)
B00008S2VG|1.0|What is she from the planet steriod??? Terrible singer. This album sucks waaay bad!
B0007P3582|3.0|50 cent's albums have sold no matter how good the actual album is in terms of lyrical ability in which he actually doesn't have. However, the songs do sound very good, making him one of the most popular rappers alive.  <br /> <br />With songs like \\"Candy Shop,\\" 50 cent delivers to the audience an extremely high beat catchy song which is sure to force the audience to keep listening. However, listen to it closely and you will realize how horrible/repetitive his lyrics are.  <br /> <br />However, songs like \\"Position of Power\\" and \\"Hate it or Love it\\" have excellent lyrics/creativity and they both sound really good. 50 cent should have reduced the amount of songs on his album until every one of them were like that.  <br /> <br />Once again, songs like \\"This is 50,\\" \\"Piggy bank,\\" and \\"Gatman and Robin\\" have horrible, HORRIBLE lyrics, but sound cool/funny. Especially \\"Gatman and Robin.\\" *Chuckles.*  <br /> <br />Of course \\"Disco Inferno\\" being a hit single, sounds superb but once again, 50's pointless lyrics strike again.  <br /> <br />One good thing though is that he features a lot of other famous rappers in his album such as Olivia/Eminem/The Game. The Game as everyone should know is an excellent rapper and actually puts thought into his songs lyrics. To bad he was kicked out of G-Unit.  <br /> <br />To wrap things up, if you care about lyrics, this album should definetely be left back on the shelf, but if you don't give a f#@$ what the lyrics are, and just care about how the songs sound, this album is worth buying.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Okay, even though I am 17, I have been stuck in the 60's and 70's music wise. I am a big fan of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, some Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd, etc. Recently I have been listening to newer music, (Franz Ferdinand, the Killers, etc) and while browsing my local library I picked up the strokes. When I first listened to it, I hate it. The songs all sounded the same and Casablancas' voice sounded strange. However after listening to the CD several more times, I could distinguish between the tracks and now I love this album. My favorites are Last Nite, Someday, and Soma, but all of the tracks are great. Yes, they are no Beatles, nor are they revolutionary, but look past the prep school image and you can find some really fun music. Enjoy it and don't worry about whether they deserved their hype or not.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I don't think I have ever seen a film that captures and delivers the essence of the depression era as well as this.<br /><br /> The cinematography and set design is outstanding, so much so that the film could be from the era it depicts and not the 1970's when it was actually made. Quite apart from the aesthetic beauty and historical accuracy, the central performances are stunning, the O'Neil partnership is electric and thoroughly hypnotic. Tatum O'Neil shines with irridescence as the wise, astute, tough little cookie; Addy. While Ryan O'Neil is beguiling as the lovable rogue. Khan is also impeccably comedic and vilely acidic at once.<br /><br /> A deserved classic and one of the most amazing child actor performances in cinema history!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|A Billiant movie that is much deeper then many people give it credit for.  There are a lot of small stories being told if a person takes the time to think about the movie and what it portrays. <br /> <br />To like or dislike any movie is subjective.  To like or dislike this movie soley that it is \\"stupid\\" is doing the movie little justice.  There is actually a high level of intellect required to fully grasp all asspects of the movie, believe it or not.  It would make a wonderful discussion for a modern American lit/film class. <br /> <br />If you don't like this movie you may be a frickin idiot!  :)
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a great movie if you're alone one night and are in the need for a good cry! Get cuddled up on the couch, get out some popcorn, and have a box of tissues by your side. This is a classic movie about finding out who you are and listening to your heart. Although decisions in life may be hard, there are just some things you have to do and risks you must be willing to take. I also loved how \\"real\\" their romance was. They fought all the time, but always made up!  <br /> <br />I was a little disappointed when the movie started coming to an end. I didn't want it to end the way I thought it was going to, and I was starting to get frustrated. When the movie finally ended, I sobbed it was so good! It was perfect and was one of those images that really stays in your mind and carries you throughout the night and into the next day.  <br /> <br />One time I sent out a survey to some of my friends via e-mail. One question was \\"When was your last good cry?\\" I had 5 come back to me and they all said the exact same thing (including mine): \\"When I watched the 'Notebook' it was such a grat movie!\\"  <br /> <br />I recommend the movie to anyone, but I suggest watching it alone or with your girlfriends. Please don't make your boyfriends/husbands sit through it (I am sure it will be pure agony for them!). ;)
0064409422|4.0|Narnia, a magical world, beckons four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, into it's realm through the back of a wardrobe.  Through this wardrobe the children find adventure and magic like nothing they could have ever imagined.  It is in Narnia that they come into contact with Aslan the Lion who bestows upon them the tools and confidence they need to become the rulers of the country.    The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fantastic children's tale, but one that holds special meaning for adults as well.  I read this as a child, re-read it in my early twenties, and now have enjoyed it during yet another decade.  Each time I read it I pick up on new symbolism and meaning and get even more out of it.  The parallels to Christianinty are more apparent with each reading and yet one can easily get swept up in the story.    This classic is to be cherished by young and old alike and a great story for parents to enjoy with their children not once, but over and over.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|As a previous reviewer said, \\"Closer is basically the ickiest, grossest, most dysfunctional parts of all your past relationships strung together into one movie.\\"  Dysfunctional is the key word here, no one trusts each other, and temptations abound.  What a mess!  Clive Owens and Jude Law are good at playing manipulative jerks and showing us how they attempt to lie themselves out of various sticky situations.  The women in the film, appear to be more of the innocent victims, caught in this web of determinism.  For a look at Julia Roberts in a little bit different of a role, a more serious role, this may be worth it. I'm afraid guys will be gawking at Ms. Portman not for her brilliance, but her body in this one.  <br /> <br />
6301966988|5.0|\\"Ghost\\" is not a classic film in the manner of \\"Gone With The Wind\\" or \\"Casablanca\\".  However, this little film caught the heart of the public with the hopeful promise of its premise and ending and fifteen years after its first release, it is still being watched.  Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze and Tony Goldwyn were all very young when they made this film, but young people were needed for their roles.  Whoopi Goldberg does a wonderful job as the medium with a questionable past who is trying hard not to let her better side get the best of her.  The Academy cited her work by awarding her an Oscar that year.  Also, featured is the wonderful character actor, Vincent Schavelli, as a schizaphrenic ghost who lives in the subway and shows Swayze's character how to \\"survive\\" in the world of the living. <br /> <br />The story is simple.  Swayze is about to discover that his best friend, Goldwyn, is acting as a go-between in a money laundering scheme.  Unknowingly, he has come into possession of the little black book which will bring down the whole scheme.  Goldwyn's hired thug kills Swayze during the attempt to get back the book.  Moore, as Swayze's fiancee, is devastated and continues  her life in deep grief.  If her performance lacks depth, it may be that someone in this state is really only going through the motions of living.  Swayze is caught in the world of the living, perhaps because of the unfinished business his sudden death has left.  As he moves through this world, he discovers what really happened, and why he was attacked.  Because Moore is now in possession of the incriminating book, Goldwyn and his henchman must get the book back.  The book is also needed because the account numbers where the money is parked are in it.  Swayze, needing to warn Moore that she is in danger, uses Goldberg's skills as a medium, to contact her.  Information, which only Moore and Swayze knew, is used to convince Moore that Swayze's ghost is still on earth, and Goldberg is acting on his behalf.  Swayze discovers that Goldman is going to transfer the money into an offshore account, and, in a very funny sequence, Goldberg dressed up in a bright pink suit and armed with fake identification, withdraws the money and, after some soul searching and pressure, signs the four million dollar check over to a group of nuns collecting money for the homeless.  Goldwyn, discovering that the money is gone, goes after Goldberg, and, not able to find her, move on to Moore's apartment.  Goldwyn, in his desperation, attacks both Goldberg and Moore and is killed. <br /> <br />As you can see, this is a very straightforward, simple story.  The reason it has held its own over the years is that it shows Swayze protecting Moore and bringing the guilty to punishment.  Many of us believe in guardian angels.  There are also two scenes where Moore, first through Goldberg, and then on her own (because of the pureness of the love she shared with Swayze?) is able to see and touch Swayze.  Which of us, having lost someone dear to us, hasn't wished for one more chance to speak to or touch that person, if only for a short while.  Finally, Swayze must go because as Goldberg tells him \\"they are waiting for you\\".  In the distance, we see a bright light and shiny figures.  Again, this fulfills the hope of many of that this isn't the end, and there really will be love ones waiting to meet us as we leave this world for the next.
B000002P5R|4.0|Once you get past the truly awful Photoshopped CD cover, \\"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\\" is an interesting anthology of Hendrix material various record labels released after his death. The majority of the best tracks are taken from \\"Cry of Love,\\" which was Warner Brothers' attempt to take the unfinished Hendrix songs closest to completion and release them as a 'farewell' album of sorts. The very best of them, such as \\"Dolly Dagger\\" and \\"Angel\\" still get substantial airplay on classic rock radio stations. <br /> <br />Jimi Hendrix was a titan of psychedelic rock guitar, but much of the material on this CD suggests he was moving towards a more funk and fusion-based style of music. As a result, there aren't any riff rockers here to rival \\"Purple Haze\\" or \\"Voodoo Child\\" but that isn't the point. This CD collects the very best attempts Hendrix made during this transitional period to try and recast himself into a style of music he hadn't yet mastered. Had he lived, I imagine many of the songs on this CD would have been remixed slightly differently. Would Hendrix had become a jazzman? I've no idea, but some of his phrasing on this CD suggest he was considering it. <br /> <br />I recommend this CD to anyone who loves Hendrix' music enough to move beyond his flamboyant rock image and into the more personal side he didn't seem to share very often. Unlike both \\"Cry of Love\\" and the hideous reissue entitled \\"Voodoo Soup,\\" \\"First Rays\\" is a very fitting goodbye to a gifted musical genius.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is a sick band to say the least.  They may not be the \\"best\\" metal band out there, by some opinions, but I fell in love with them the second I first heard them on the radio.  They only made my passion for metal stronger with their mind-blowing lyrics and beats.  I'd recommend this cd to anyone...it's pure emotion in action.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|ok i watched this once and was somewhat distracted but this is a good somewhat intelligent thriller that was inspired by how \\"dark\\" it was by \\"seven\\" (but does not really copy it), it could have been directed great but missed the mark because some of the acting was bad, had bad flow in certain spots, too much gore was shown, and a couple unanswered questions (don't tell me saw 2 is coming soon?? :P)..  where the movie wins is the overall suspense, but again it could have been done much better..
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|\\"Workin day n night\\" , \\"Heal The world\\" , \\"Speed Demon\\" , \\"Gone too soon\\" , \\"In the closet\\"..are some of many other MJ's fantastic tracks missing in this Ultimate Collection.  It should have been renamed as \\" Oops...this really isn't really the ULTIMATE HIT COLLECTION\\". <br /> <br />The album makes up for a great artwork and indepth discography and a look at Michael's career graph..the songs selected are some of his finest. But the real treat are some of his unreleased tracks..a great treasure for all MJ fans. I was so hooked on his solo demo version of \\"We are the world\\" i wish it were the single version.  <br /> <br />Over all if you love MJ and dont mind having some of his hits again added with bonus unrleased songs , plus an awesome DVD of his live performance. Then go ahead and buy it. Its a treat. <br /> <br />Wish there was a 6th disc to add the rest of the lost songs which were very much essential for thei ULTIMATE HIT COLLECTION. <br />

B00007KWHN|5.0|I really believe that this is the genesis of Prog Rock as a movement (i also believe that prog rock started with Sgt Pepper)..but as a movement, as a wave, this is the album that started all (for me). This is the first SUPER album of the genre. It has everything : great performances great melodies, long songs, short songs....magic. Explore it.... <br /> <br />Pienso de verdad que este es la gnesis del Rock Progresivo como movimiento (tambin creo que el primer disco progresivo fue Sgt Pepper), pero como movimiento, como ola, como \\"moda\\" , este es el album que comenz todo.

B00005QG9J|5.0|First off what I would like to say is that whoever put incubus in the catagory of metal or rap or rap-metal or whatever is quite possibly the dumbest person alive. In none of their albums do they even resemble this genre. Morning View is an excelent example of this. <br /> <br />One of the more brilliant aspects of this CD, and why I feel this could be the best album ever, is the balance of it. Every song on the album is ethereal and ballad like, without becoming too mellow, and heavy and rock like without being blasty and harsh. Not only did they control the extremes in every song, but every song has aspects of the extent to which they take the extremes. One thing that makes Brandon Boyd such a brilliant vocalist and singer is how he manages to make his voice almost another instrument. Unlike other rock bands whose vocalists tend to dominate songs, Incubus' instrumentals and vocals work together and play off each other to make a listening experience that is very unique. <br /> <br />The album's genious comes from the brilliant use of transitions, both within songs and between songs. Songs change freqently between heavy and calm, giving each song definate balance. At the same time, each song has its own feel if heavy or soft when it is finished and the arrangement of songs alternates them with fantastic transitions as well as giving the album overall balance. The balance motife continues within the writing of each song. Everything that is incorporated into each song is treated as an equally important instrument. The vocals, the guitar, the drums, the DJ, the bass, and all of the background instruments (piano, violin, sitar, etc.) take turns being the lead, focus, or drive of the song.
B000000OSE|5.0|Use Your Illusion, Part I (1991.), Guns n' Roses' second studio album<br /><br />'Use Your Illusion, Part I' was at the time, with part II, a unique album feat. Never before had a band put together two epic albums and released them at the same time. The band's debut effort, 'Appetite For Destruction' was a massive success and was itself one of the greatest albums of all time. Therefore, the LA based metal quintet had an awful lot to live up to with their follow up effort. Fans of the band had waited a long time for the follow up to Appetite and so when it was released, were they disappointed? Not in the slightest!<br /><br />In fairness, the Use Your Illusion albums are not as good as 'Appetite For Destruction', in my opinion but then, how can you top one of the greatest classic rock masterpieces of all time? 'Use Your Illusion, Part I' is in my opinion, the better of the two parts - it's much more consistent, has no bad tracks and also has some real stand out tracks in there too. I also think this is the heavier of the two albums. GN'R still have their classic sound too - Axl Rose still fronting the line up with his familiar protesting vocals and Slash's guitar playing on the album is first rate, with plenty of excellent solos on most of the tracks. The only real change to the line up was the addition of Matt Sorum, who replaced Stephen Adler on the drums, who was chucked out the band after acquiring a real excessive drug addiction. The songwriting on the album is very good, with all members of the band contributing. Certainly, Izzy Stradlin' is underrated as a songwriter and many of the best tracks were penned/copenned by him, such as 'Dust n' Bones', 'Dont Cry' and 'Double Talkin' Jive'.<br /><br />Guns n' Roses have attracted no end of controversy over the years which have caused them to be loved or hated by loads of people. However, whether you like them or not, you have to give them credit for the risks they took with their music. Releasing two epic albums at the same time was very ambitious but it paid off and gave the band the unique feat of holding the top two spots in the Billboard 200 album chart at once. This is proof though, of how good their music was when they were at their peak. If there was one criticism though, it would be centered around having the 'Use Your Illusion' in two parts. If the best material from part I and the uneven part II was taken and put into a single album, it would have made a phenominal CD, something to definitely rival their debut effort and plenty of other classic albums.<br /><br />Well you cant have it all.... So what are the highlights of the 'Use Your Illusion' Part I. The opening tracks are excellent. 'Right Next Door To Hell' is a blistering 3 minute opener with Axl Rose screaming out the vocals. 'Dust n' Bones' is one of the best, slower, with a piano part integrated into the tune - Izzy Stradlin sings this one with a real arrogant style but it works very well. The GNR version of 'Live n' Let Die' knocks the stuffing out of Paul McCartney's Wings version, with plenty of vigour and some killer guitar playing from Slash. 'Dont Cry' is a GNR signature tune but its an excellent, more heartfelt song with an interesting finish were Rose's last word sustains for AGES - this original version is BETTER than the version on Part II. 'You Aint the First' shows GNR were also no slouches at acoustic stuff and 'Bad Obsession' is an upbeat rocker with a mouthorgan part over the top (reminds me a bit of the Led Zep classic 'When the Levee Breaks'). 'November Rain' is another highlight - has an orchestral style backing, a bit of a grand scheme idea from Axl Rose but it works well on here, the track being an excellent epic with more good stuff on the guitar. For a bashed out real heavy metal style track, look no further than 'Garden of Eden'. The closing tracks, 'Dead Horse' and 'Coma', are both brilliant, the latter being a 10 minute epic with plenty of effects.<br /><br />Use Your Illusion Part Iis an excellent effort which saw Guns n' Roses still producing hard rock at its best. It's no Appetite For Destruction but its still well worth buying, probably advisably with Part II, although I think this part is more consistent and better overall. Guns n' Roses were a great rock act, producing great music at their height with plenty of showmanship. This album will not disappoint you.ns n' Roses still producing hard rock at its best.

B0000027I6|5.0|Perhaps it would be sacrilege to say that I enjoyed this masterpiece than any of the Pink Floyd works, but I have to say that I did. From start to finish, every song is captivating, and although it's hard to pinpoint any hard evidence, this is a concept album. It may be the way the tracks flow so well together; it may be because of the lyrical content, but either way, this is an album that has to be heard from start to finish. <br /> <br />My favorite part has to be the final three tracks, 'Three Wishes,' 'It's a Miracle,' and the title track, 'Amused to Death.' Not many songs move me the way the finale to this amazing album does, and the only ones that can make me feel the same would probably be other tracks on the album. <br /> <br />When you give this album your full attention, it takes you to another place. With the sound effects and the strength of the music, you're blocked off from the rest of the world and all you can hear is Roger singing. <br /> <br />For those looking for stuff that sounds like Floyd, I'd suggest getting 'The Division Bell,' even though it isn't nearly as hard-hitting as 'Amused to Death.' This is all I've been listening to for the past month, and I urge you to get it right now.
B000000OSG|4.0|Use Your Illusion, Part II (1991.), Guns n' Roses' third studio album<br /><br />'Use Your Illusion, Part II' was at the time a unique album feat. Never before had a band put together two epic albums and released them at the same time. The band's debut effort, 'Appetite For Destruction' was a massive success and was itself one of the greatest albums of all time. Therefore, the LA based metal quintet had an awful lot to live up to with their follow up effort. Fans of the band had waited a long time for the follow up to Appetite and so when it was released, were they disappointed? Not in the slightest!<br /><br />'Use Your Illusion, Part II' for me is the weaker of the two albums; it is much more uneven and inconsistent with both some excellent, unsurpassable tracks but also some really, really bad tracks too which brings down the work's overall standing. This part, for me is also not quite as heavy as its partner, still however, we still have the classic GN'R sound and the music is on the whole very good with lots of firepower. Axl Rose still fronts the line up with his familiar protesting vocals and Slash's guitar playing on the album is first rate, with plenty of excellent solos on most of the tracks. The only real change to the line up was the addition of Matt Sorum, who replaced Stephen Adler on the drums, who was chucked out the band after acquiring a real excessive drug addiction. The songswriting goes from the sublime (i.e. Estranged) to the plain ridiculous (i.e. My World - more about that later).<br /><br />Guns n' Roses have attracted no end of controversy over the years which have caused them to be loved or hated by loads of people. However, whether you like them or not, you have to give them credit for the risks they took with their music. Releasing two epic albums at the same time was very ambitious but it paid off and gave the band the unique feat of holding the top two spots in the Billboard 200 album chart at once. This is proof though, of how good their music was when they were at their peak. If there was one criticism though, it would be centered around having the 'Use Your Illusion' in two parts. If the best material from part I and the uneven part II was taken and put into a single album, it would have made a phenominal CD, something to definitely rival their debut effort and plenty of other classic albums.<br /><br />Nevermind, the music is still great on the whole for this album. The opener for Part II is one of GN'R's best, 'Civil War'. This is 7 minutes of pure brilliance, with plenty of heartfelt lyrics. The whole thing leaves you with a great line - 'What's so civil about war anyway?' '14 Years' follows this, an underrated song by Izzy Stradlin, who sings on this one. 'Knockin on Heavens Door' is one of the more famous GN'R tracks, a cover of Bob Dylan's original - its a great track, with a brilliant solo from Slash midway through. This track for some reason gets more attention than better GN'R tracks which is a bit unfair but I suppose it has more of a commercial feel to it. Then we have a dip in quality.... 'Get in the Ring' is more of an arrogant ramble than anything, the language doesn't bother me but it spoils a pretty good track rhythmically. Similarly, 'Shotgun Blues' is just a mess, with no direction and just a songwriters hash with guitar riffs thown over the top of bad lyrics. However, we see the light with the excellent 'Breakdown', a long track with plenty of drive and a great piano part underlying the music. 'Locomotive' has plenty of great moments to keep the 8 minute epic worth the listen and 'So Fine' is a slower, more passionate track with great lyrics (now are you seeing how up and down the album is!)...<br /><br />Then we come to Estranged. This is, for me the greatest track that GN'R ever made. It is 9+ minutes of sheer ecstacy ... I've not heard a track quite like it. From the whispering opening from Axl Rose through plenty of great sections on the guitar from Slash through to thefinal drumroll, this track will captivate your imagination, thats how good it is! 'You Could Be Mine' is an excellent track too - the heaviest, most classic metal sounding on the album. However, the album should have ended there but we have two unnecessary tracks. The first is an alternative version of 'Dont Cry'. Its still pretty good, but I dont think its necessary a 2nd time round, or is as good as the original. Then we have 'My World', a 1 minute piece of s**t. Dont let this short piece of crap put you off the whole album. You wonder what the hell Axl had in mind when he penned this rock-rap failure - I thought it was another band when I first listened to it. When you listen to 'Use Your Illusion Part II' turn off after 'You Could Be Mine' and you will feel satisfied with a great album, listening on to 'My World' just leaves a bad taste in the mouth!<br /><br />Overall, the 3 'bad' tracks aside, 'Use Your Illusion, Part II' is a thoroughly excellent album. Guns n' Roses are doing hard rock at its best for most of this album. This is no Appetite For Destruction but it is still definitely worth buying if you like Guns n' Roses's music. Get it with Part I (the better half of the pair in my opinion) and enjoy 2 1/2 hours of great music. This is the last great work from the great rock act, Guns n' Roses before they lost their way, in most part due to Axl's grand schemes and the coming of grunge metal bands.

B00004Z459|4.0|Yes, Linkin Park sound like a \\"Johnny Come Lately to an already over-saturated musical genre\\" and no, this band isn't really heavy metal. With that said, Linkin Park are a great new band who do what they do as good or better than anybody else.<br /><br />This album's \\"hybrid\\" is that of hard rock, hip-hop vocals/rhythms and electronic and industrial beats. Some bands couldn't make it work--they couldn't blend all of these elements. And some bands' song writing strucure (soft verse, hard chorus) would stick out like a sore thumb. But Linkin Park do it correctly. The verses (often with hip-hop vocals) flow so smoothly into the hard rock parts. The key ingredient here is a great DJ, who does more than the random scratch. He is what makes it so fluid, so you can barely tell when the verse ends and the chorus begins.<br /><br />Surely you've heard this a million times by now, but no \\"Hybrid Theory\\" review is complete without a discussion of the vocals. Mike Shinoda handles the rapping while Chester Bennington does the singing/crooning and yelling over the hard choruses. That's another reason why this album is so good; the two singers share the vocals, alternating back and forth without canceling one another out.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Papercut\\" begins with an almost danceable, \\"chug-chug\\" electronic beat (but only for a few seconds), before the guitars hit the scene. This song has the album's biggest guitar riffs, with some nice crooning during the bridge.<br /><br />\\"Points of Authority\\" has the guitarist playing crucny riffs over a catchy, DJ driven beat. My favorite part of this song is the end, when the DJ mixes things up and changes the beat three times.<br /><br />\\"By Myself\\" mixes throbbing guitars and a spacey beat. The song eventually gains momentum off itself and has big choruses.<br /><br />\\"In the End\\" begins with what sounds like a piano (making a \\"ding dong\\" sound) and swift rap. By the end, however, it's the same old Linkin Park: it morphs into a rock song with normal, elongated singing.<br /><br />\\"Forgotten\\" includes throbbing, \\"boom-boom\\" riffs with catchy DJ scratching thrown in between. Chester begins by almost whispering and ends by almost yelling.<br /><br />\\"Cure for the Itch\\" is an instrumental which shows how talented Mr. Hahn (the DJ) is, if you didn't already know. He makes all kinds of different and very catchy beats.<br /><br />This C.D. is not without it's flaws, however. The big gripe I have with this album is the lyrics. Teenagers will relate to many of these lyrics, but that's just because it seems like they were written by fellow teenagers (i.e.: \\"Shut up! Shut up when I'm talking to you!\\" and \\"One step closer to the edge, and I'm about to break\\".) But the songs are catchy enough to make up for the fairly immature and typical words. Lyrics are a timely thing, bands get better as they age, but for now, I've learned to just focus on the sound.<br /><br />The other problem with \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is, at a mere 38 minutes, it's too dang short! \\"Pushing Me Away\\" is rather anti-climatic, it builds to a midpoint then fades out and the C.D. is over, leaving the listener longing for more songs.<br /><br />All in all though, it's a very solid C.D. Don't listen to this C.D. expecting to hear Tupac-esque rapping or Pantera style metal. And if you hate nu-metal, this won't change your mind; it may even worsen your hate for it. No, Linkin Park aren't innovators, but that doesn't mean they can't do their type of music better than some of their peers.

0800141326|5.0|I have been a big fan of Godzilla ever since I was 4 and this was the best Godzilla film. Eventually it would've been better if the old Godzilla was thrashing through NY. Right now I'm trying to see Godzilla Vs. Megaguirus, but I'm also looking for ones that have Mechagodzilla in it. He's my favorite. Megaguirus is my 2nd favorite.
B000021YQV|5.0|Unless you have a grudge against political rock, I don't see how anyone can trash this C.D. or say it's overrated. This C.D. is one of my favorites and, in my opinion, was the second best C.D. of 2001 (second only to Tool's \\"Lateralus\\".) I wouldn't call it nu-metal-- sure, there are typically heavy riffs and drum beats, but the soulful vocals (sometimes soulful, granted they sometimes yell) and meaningful/thought-provoking lyrics make this more than nu-metal. I'd call it intelligent metal. The lyrics aren't entirely political (although they often are) also deal drugs and groupies, and other issues (over population, and science failing \\"mother earth\\").<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Prison Song\\" opens with a hard hitting riff which startled me at first. It then turns to chugging, machine gun riffs and drums, in between which singer Serj Tankien whispers \\"they're trying to build a prison.\\" The song's \\"boom-boom\\" riffs remain throughout the song while Serj's angry voice sings Rage Against the Machine-esque paranoid lyrics about the government, prisons, and drug money.<br />\\"Needles\\" is as heavy as \\"Prison Song\\", but it has a dark theme and when guitarist Daron Malankian sings two minutes into the song (and Serj later joins him), it turns melodic. It then turns to turns back to hard, chugging guitars while Serj alternates between almost soulful and yelling.<br />\\"Deer Dance\\" is a personal favorite. The guitars are slower, but equally as heavy. Lyrically, it's about crooked cops shooting little kids. My favorite part of this song is when Serj's voice comes down after the chorus, he sings the following verse slowly (whispering at some points) until the build up of the next chorus. Here, you'd think there'd be a heavy break down, but Serj and Daron sing a capella for about two seconds. Then, the bone crunching riffs and yelling return to end the song.<br />\\"Jet Pilot\\" is really fast with some good guitar work, but Serj's nonsense lyrics (which I think are about war) drag this song down a bit. It sounds good, though.<br />Surely, most of us know how good the hit single \\"Chop Suey\\" is. It's brilliantly combines metal, melody, soulful vocals and thought provoking lyrics. You can put your own meaning to this song; since it's lyrics deal with religion (Jesus, angels and spirits) and suicide.<br />I think \\"Bounce\\" is thrown in purely for mosh pit purposes. It's not political, it's just a fun song to listen to. The guitar chugs fast, and Serj sings a head banging chorus (\\"Bounce! Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo!\\")<br />\\"ATWA\\" goes from slow verses to fast choruses, with great riffs. Serj shows his vocal range, here.<br />\\"Toxicity\\" has great drum work (the best on the C.D.) with more irresistable riffs and deep, soulful vocals.<br />\\"Psycho\\" builds slowly to another irresistable chorus that you'll have in your head for days. The guitars and drums hit equally as heavy and simultaneously.<br />\\"Arials\\" is, again, beautiful and heavy. Serj does some more real singing, in between the choruses (where his voice raises.) The lyrics, which compare life to a waterfall, are almost poetic. My favoirte part of this song, though, is at the very end of the song (when you think it's over). Here, an instrument that sounds like an Indian flute plays a solo for a few seconds, then is joined by soft drumming and chanting. Brilliant.<br /><br />So, this album is a masterpiece.

B000092Q4U|4.0|Lamb of God are a very promising young band. Probably the fastest rising band to come out of the \\"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\\" heap, and they've got my vote for the best new metal band to be born in the new millennium. Their second album, \\"As the Palaces Burn\\", is a brutal barrage that pulls no punches and pummels the listener's ear drums. With its impenetrable wall of sound, killer double bass drumming, fiery guitar work and an occasional guitar solo, this album should be any and every metalhead's dream.<br /><br />The band didn't make this album on a major record label, so there isn't a big production job. Thus, singer Randy Blythe's voice and Chris Adler's drums are more raw than on their next release, \\"Ashes of the Wake.\\" It's up for debate whether that's a good thing or not, but there's no denying that Blythe's yell/growl goes great with the background music.<br /><br />Due to the production, Blythe's vocals take a back seat to the guitars and drums. Drummer Chris Adler is at the root of Lamb of God's attack. He makes the beat a big, relentless wave which gets shoved down the listener's throat. But he sometimes creates breakdowns that change the beat (to a usually slower and heavier one). Sometimes, when listening to this album, I could have sworn Adler wasn't beating his drums, but beating the outside of my headphones. Adler's persistent double bass drumming (which is usually a death metal blast beat or machine gun attack) and Blythe's Cookie Monster vocals make Lamb of God stand out from other \\"New Wave of Metal\\" bands.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Ruin\\" is a good representation of Lamb of God: super aggressive, hard hitting and raw. It has a \\"ba boom boom\\" beat with pounding drums and Blythe shrieks like he's being stabbed. There's a breakdown in the middle of the song (following the guitar solo), making a bobbing beat with bobbing guitars. It ends with another mini solo and a small explosion sound.<br /><br />\\"Purified\\" features guest guitar work by ex-Megadeth axeman Chris Poland. The solo he lays down here is good, but I would have definitely liked it more if it were longer.<br /><br />\\"11th Hour\\" is the lead single and a personal favorite. The whole song is catchy, but I like it when Blythe bellows over just the double bass (no other instruments). Also, this song has GREAT give-and-take between the guitars and drums. After this part, it turns to Pantera-style riffing.<br /><br />\\"Boot Scraper\\" begins with cascading (almost machine gun) riffs and drums, but my favorite part of this song is pounding double bass solo. Adler must have had bricks attached to his feet when he was playing this part.<br /><br />\\"A Devil in God's Country\\" is almost mind boggling (with rapid, back-and-forth guitar and drum work).<br /><br />\\"Blood Junkie\\" is my second favorite song on the album. It begins with an almost inaudible spoken word, but the vocals gain volume as the song progresses. This track is a highlight because it has (1,2,3,) 4 beat changes and heavy breakdowns. Part of this song has bobbing riffs.<br /><br />I gave this C.D. four stars--even though technically speaking it should be rated 4.5--because it could stand to have a tad bit more texture. I don't think they should add any melody, like Shadows Fall or Killswitch Engage, because if they did, there would be nothing to distinguish Lamb of God from those bands. When I say they should add a tad bit more texture, I'm not saying they should make anything like a pop ballad, but the constant double bass drumming makes some parts of some of the songs blend together. Plus, I DO think the vocals became more diverse and interesting when the band signed with Sony (a year after this album was released).<br /><br />But those two small things didn't stop \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" from becoming the second most contagious album of the year. Plus, there should be nothing to deter you from checking this album out if you love metal or thrash or the \\"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\\" scene. Or, if you are just tired of hearing such bands as Nickelback or other wimpy modern rock bands that control the radio's airwaves, Lamb of God should be your dream come true.Or, if you are just tired of hearing such bands as Nickelback or other wimpy modern rock bands that control the radio's airwaves, Lamb of God should be your dream come true.

B0002XDODU|4.0|Rammstein change their formula a bit for their fifth album. Some would say \\"If it ain't broken, why fix it?\\", but Rammstein decided they needed to make more of a straight forward metal album. They have all but deleted the industrial/dance parts of their music (except for the keyboards). The band also churned out riffs that are different than what we've heard on their last two albums. The \\"chugga chugga\\" riffs are out, and wall shaking riffs are in. Add a singer who growls and almost snarls at times, and you have Rammstein's new sound. Dark, loud and brooding; similar to Coal Chamber, circa 2002.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />The title track's verses has vocals and a slow, almost spacey drum beat. The chorus, however, has a couple of riffs and the song ends with what sounds like a violin.<br /><br />\\"Mein Tell\\" is the lead single, and rightfully so. A good headbanger, it explodes with stereo rattling guitar noise. The singer's (Till Lindemann's) growling/snarling voice goes well with the music and the verses are good lead-ins to the heavy choruses.<br /><br />\\"Dalai Lama\\" begins with soft notes, as the guitarist slowly picks at the guitar's fret board. Keyboards are included in the verses, but the chorus has choppy, chunky riffs.<br /><br />\\"Amerika\\" is the other single. The beginning and chorus have more strong riffs, but this song is a standout because the choruses are sung (not snarled) in English. Towards the end of the song, new wave keyboards make an entrance (against a background of churning guitar riffs).<br /><br />\\"Morgenstern\\" begins with what sounds like a female church choir. Then the guitars come aboard and make \\"boom boom\\" riffs, with the singer snarling in between them.<br /><br />If I could recommend any changes to this album, I'd say make some more industrial (Skinny Puppy-ish) dance numbers (\\"Los\\" is the only song I found myself tapping my foot to.) I wouldn't delete any of the songs in favor of the industrial dance numbers, I'd just add to what's already on this C.D.<br /><br />But the bottom line is, this is good metal. It's dark enough if you're looking for gothic metal, but the keyboards should appeal to industrial metal fans. I can't see why anybody (*cough* Entertainment Weekly *cough*) would say this C.D. is monotonous. There are songs that rock hard (i.e. \\"Mein Tell\\"), but there are also songs that are a lot quieter and more restrained (i.e. \\"Dalai Lama\\").<br /><br />Many people can't get past the language barrier, which is too bad. It's funny why Americans can't get past the language barrier, when Europeans can! Bands like Slipknot and Metallica are just as popular as Rammstein in Germany. \\"Reise, \\"Reise\\" is already a hit in Germany, but to succeed in America, they need a hit single (like \\"Du Hast\\"). \\"Mein Tell\\" and \\"Amerika\\" come close, but they haven't quite gotten the radio play they deserve. Support small time, underrated music, check this album out-Rammstein deserve it. If nothing else, call your local radio station and request they play some Rammstein.

B00004XMS0|4.0|(Batman) - Michael Keaton - does not physically look like Batman but gives a superb performance. <br />Jack Nicholson - no one could play the Joker any better IMO <br />Kim Basinger - so so performance(kind of bland) <br />Tim Burton - awesome director did Batman justice <br />overall I did not buy the relationship between Keaton and Basinger - to me they seemed mismatched - but overall one of the best superhero movies made to date.  <br /> <br /> <br />(Batman Returns) <br />Michael Keaton and Tim Burton same as above <br />Michelle Pfeiffer - best Catwoman to date <br />Danny Devito - an unbelievably great Penguin <br />also one of the best superhero movies to date also better pairing Keaton with Pfeiffer than with Basinger IMO. <br /> <br />(Batman Forever) mediocre at best  <br />Val Kilmer - even though he looks more like Batman than Clooney or Keaton- he gave a horrific performance. It seemed to me that everyone else in the movie was of a more upbeat tempo and pace and he was moving at a slow dark  pace. It was obvious to me how bad his performance was when minutes into the film I was wishing he was Keaton. <br />Nichole Kidman - not bad so so not much to say <br />Jim Carrey - good job in doing riddler - it was a little over the top - but still a good job <br />Tommy Lee Jones - a great job - although he played two face a little too dumb and easily manipulated for my taste <br />Chris O'Donnell - so so also not much to say - a little annoying <br />overall a completely different film than the first two and nowhere in the same league. <br /> <br /> <br />(Batman and Robin) <br />George Clooney - not Batman at all - he is a bad actor and does not look the part - nothing else to say <br />Chris O'Donnell - same as for Batman Forever except maybe even more annoying <br />Uma Thurman - not bad so so <br />The Terminator - not his best work (not that he has a best work he is not necessarily known for his acting) <br />May be the worst superhero film of all time upthere with Hulk and Daredevil. <br /> <br />I think the last two movies in an attempt to seperate themselves from the first two went more with the cheese and less with the meat. <br /> <br />Personally, I would like to see someone cast in the roll who can give a Keaton like performance and actually look the part. So far Adam West has most looked the part and Michael Keaton has most acted the part.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Even if I gave only a select few C.D.s five stars, \\"Rust in Peace\\" is one of those albums that would still get five. It is the creme of the crop when it comes to thrash/metal. It is, in my opinion, Megadeth's best album and it also rivals Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" (another five star album). Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman are among metal's best guitarists, and here they are on top of their game, making nearly every song (minus \\"Down Control\\") a hit and essential metalhead listening. The vocals can be a tad bit whiney at times, but the music definitely takes up that slack.<br /><br />Most Megadeth fans think of this album as their first non-thrash album. Why?! Even if it isn't as thrash-y compared to their first three albums, it's just as aggressive, and it has all the characteristics of a thrash album (fast riffs, great solos, etc.) There's a fine line between thrash and speed metal; so, even if you don't think of this album as thrash, atleast think of it as wonderful speed metal.<br /><br />Now, I'm confused. Amazon customers gave the original C.D. five stars, but the remastered version is only averaging four. Again...why?! The sound quality of the remastered version is so much better, plus it comes with a previously unreleased song (\\"My Creation\\")!<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Holy Wars\\" is speedy and full of good riffs and leads. This song has two parts to it: the first two and a half minutes are \\"Holy Wars\\", then there's an acoustic interlude, and the last four minutes of the song are \\"The Punishment Due\\". Two guitar solos within the first five minutes. The whole song is very catchy, but my favorite part of it is when it turns to a galloping riff/beat near the end, with another great (and plenty long) solo.<br />\\"Hangar 18\\" is the single. It's a fan favorite and definitely a personal favorite. There are 1,2,3...11 guitar solos in this song! Mustaine and Friedman face off in a \\"who can shred better\\" duel. The first half of the song is singing with solos, but the second half is instrumental (solos with solos). Every few seconds there is great, wailing solo, but I'd say the sixth is my favorite. Megadeth are the only band in history to attempt as many solos as they did in one song. And yes, I think Mustaine is better than Kirk Hammett.<br />\\"Take No Prisoners\\" has a more audible bass, especially in the beginning and choruses. My favorite part of this song, though, is the end: Mustaine yelling \\"Take no prisoners, take no sh*t\\" over Friedman's solos.<br />\\"Five Magics\\" is another great, catchy listen. After a slow, two-minute intro, it kick starts and becomes another thrash classic. Friedman tosses in a guitar solo in between every line Mustaine sings in the opening verse. Six guitar solos (aw, only six?) in this song.<br />\\"Lucretia\\" begins with what sounds like a baby laughing, then turns to \\"chug chug\\" riffing. This song is worth mentioning, however, for the guitar solo in the middle. It lasts over a minute and fifteen seconds!<br />\\"Tornado of Souls\\" has great, mighty catchy, riffs peppered througout the whole song, and a very catchy chorus. Another great, scorching guitar solo highlights this track, too.<br /><br />The extra tracks are all pre-Marty Friedman (with Chris Poland handling the guitar duties). \\"My Creation\\" is decent, but much too short and the demos aren't anything too special either. So, it's not really worth buying the remaster just for these tracks (unless you're a Megadeth completist). But no matter what kind of Megadeth fan you are, it definitely IS worth buying the remaster for the much improved sound quality.<br /><br />The bottom line is, this is thrash at it's best and essential listening for metalheads. You're just not metal if you don't own this C.D. (and know the song \\"Hangar 18\\"). If you enjoyed the original version of \\"Rust in Peace\\", you will enjoy this remaster as much, but probably much more.is instrumental (solos with solos).

B000002U82|5.0|I bought this album having no idea what to expect other than the fact that it was made in 1973 and the artist Pink Floyd was a progressive rock group.<br />42 minutes and 10 seconds later I was left speechless, blown away, and in utter amazement.  This album left me almost with a whole new outlook on life.  The lyrics, vocals, instruments, performances......mindblowing.  Track 3 &quot;Time&quot; in my opinion may just be the absolute single greatest recording I have ever heard.  7:06 of musical brilliance and genius.  <br />Upon first listen for me, this CD blew away Black Sabbath, Metallica, AC/DC, Van Halen, Guns N Roses, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and every other &quot;rock&quot; group I'd ever heard other then Led Zeppelin and thats.  And if I had to choose between Floyd or Zeppelin upon their careers the edge undoubtedly goes to Floyd.  Zeppelin could never match this CD. &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; is vastly overrated and cant match up with &quot;Time&quot;. <br />&quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is not just a rock CD.  Name a musical genre other than pop, rap and the hard core punk/metal which should not even be considered music when you have people lipsinking and the amazingly awful American Idol.  DSOTM is rock, blues, and jazz depending on which song you are playing.  And did I mention the sound production??? Outstanding.<br />In conclusion, &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is to music what &quot;The Godfather&quot; is to movies. An epic, timeless, must-have CD.
B0000009UG|3.0|There's a few highlights of this album, but I certainly wouldn't rate it up among Bowie's best. People tend to group this one in with Bowie's underrated albums, I don't really see the point of that. It's not a great album, nor is it a terrible one. <br /> <br />It's No Game (both parts) are great openers and closers, and the idea of having one part that is in English and the other in Japanese is pretty cool. <br /> <br />Ashes to Ashes is of course fantastic and the best song on the album. Fashion for me, is his best song of the '80s (though this was 1979, heh). Scream Like a Baby is equally well done, with the '80s timeline clearly stamped on its production.  <br /> <br />As far as bonus tracks go, the re-recording of Space Oddity (on piano), is great. The re-recording of Panic in Detroit is very lackluster and just badly done overall (though I love the original). Unless you're a Bowie completist, the bonus tracks aren't worth it. <br /> <br />But the album itself has about 4 or 5 really good songs (read: Bowie staples), which is still pretty good for an album of 10 tracks. There's a nice sound throughout the album, but the songwriting itself just runs out of steam. I'd put this in the \\"average Bowie album\\" category.
B000092T6M|5.0|Although I never have had a concrete interpretation of the Robin Hood legend stories 1991's \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" is without a doubt one of my childhood favorite movies and could very well be my favorite movie starring Kevin Costner.
B00005JMJG|5.0|From the mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a stunningly original film that features possibly career best performances from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet as doomed couple Joel and Clementine.  When Joel learns that Clementine that undergone a proceedure to erase her memories of him, Joel strikes back by undertaking the same treatment.  However, as the proceedure gets underway, Joel realizes that throughout their tumultuous relationship, he has and will always love her, and he fights to save his memories.  As you can tell by the plot synopsis and previous reviews, Eternal Sunshine is not a film for everyone and it's not something that is instantly likeable.  What Eternal Sunshine is however, is a brilliant and original love story for a new age, excellently handled by visionary director Michel Gondry.  The rest of the cast, including Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and David Cross, do great work.  There should be more films like this; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a surprising emotional tour de force that bombards all your senses at once, and once you take it all in the first time, you'll be longing for another trip.

B000000H66|5.0|There isn't much you can say about Death that hasn't already been said.  One of the most influential and beloved bands in the death metal genre, \\"Symbolic\\" is Chuck Schuldiner and co. at their very best.  The guitar work is the most medlodic guitar work you will ever hear on an album with the term \\"death metal\\" associated with it, and this is apparent on the title track, \\"Zero Tolerance\\", \\"1,000 Eyes\\", and \\"Perennial Quest\\".  \\"Symbolic\\" shows the maturation of Chuck's songwriting, seperating Death even farther apart from the rest of the death metal pack, making them something truly unique.  As a previous reviewer stated, Death didn't have cookie monster-esque vocals all the time or deal with lyrics about brutality and killing; Death provided thought provoking lyrics combined with an incredibly melodic death metal roar that many have immitated but never duplicated.  \\"Symbolic\\" remains possibly the best album from Death, and it is the crowning achievement of the late Chuck Schuldiner.  If you're a new fan to the band, this is as good a place to start as any.
B0001XWV12|1.0|After being dumped by his girlfriend Fiona (Kristen Kreuk (Tv's Smallville)and loses to a punked up bald Matt Damon (Dogma), Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) goes with his buddy Cooper (Jacob Pitts) to find a girl named Mieke who he thought was a guy but found out he was a girl and goes to correct his mistake. Along the way they meet their friends who are twins,played by Michelle Trachtenberg (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) and Travis Wester. They get sidetracked going from Paris to Berlin, going to a all dude nude beach, getting dumped in a slum Slovakian neighborhood, eatting brownies that have no drugs in them, getting a dominatrix like meeting and going to Rome and recking havoc in The Vatican. Not much fun here with a lot of stuff that isnt funny, is totally boring, though the young stars are appealing, they get floundered into a stupid script. Though The Vatican scene with the whole \\"The Pope Is Dead\\" thing was a chuckle, though even yesterday he passed away...thought it was funny when the actor playing The Pope was like \\"What the hell\\". Not much here. The cast includes Diedrich Bader (Office Space), Vinnie Jones (Snatch), Patrick Malahide, Rade Sherbedgia (Eyes Wide Shut), Phil Kilbane (Tv's MADTV), Steve Hytner (The Prophecy Trilogy), J.P. Manoux (Tv's Angel) and an unbilled Jeffrey Tambor (Hellboy).
B00008S2VG|2.0|Has Madonna ever sung w/the beautiful Cyndi Lauper? I think they should do a duet. Or maybe not. I think they both have different voices, but would blend well together. Her first album, her self-titled one, is still her best one. My opinion.
B000001GRE|4.0|I have not always been a fan of Boulez' Mahler. For the most part I find him too \\"cool.\\" However, the 7th is probably the most abstract and least emotional of the Mahler works. I am suprised at his tempi in the first movement (somehat slow but not as slow as the lumbering Klemperer.) Yet, overall its a good performance and the Cleveland players perform well. My favorite in this work has always been the first Bernstein recording. He really makes the work sound exciting and the NY Philharmonic plays their hearts out for him. His second recording on DG is good but the New York Philharmonic recording is better.
B0002858YS|4.0|Here's what happened with this album: I saw the Mr. Brightside video and I was a little insulted becuase whoever decided it would be a great idea to totally knock off Moulin Rouge was a little behind the beat.  But I liked the song.  I went to the Island Records website and I totally boned up on The Killers, I watched all the online interviews, the videos, I read all the reviews, and I bought the cd.  From the moment I put the thing in my player I was totally convinced that I liked this stuff, but it wore off fast.  The lyrics are, admittedly, a bit juvenile--most of the songs are about overly passionate, hormonally imbalanced, high school relationships.  And, I'll be honest, that stuff just doesn't stand the test of time. <br /> <br />Now, about a month after first hearing the entire album, I still like Hot Fuss and I think The Killers are doing something really innovative (as far as their sound and the way they present themselves) but I have the same feeling for this album that I have for an old crush... it was hot and heavy while it lasted and I still have some fondness for it, but the \\"newness\\" wore off and what's left is a nice piece of nostalgia.  In the end, I don't want to discourage anyone from buying this album because I certainly enjoy it (even now), but be cautioned.  And, I also have to say that the song, \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" is completely worth the entire album--every penny--it's such an uplifting, positive, makes the world look better kind of song.

B0007ZAL66|5.0|Below is the review I wrote concerning this movie a year ago. The only DVD version was a full screen Hong Kong boot. The reason I am plugging this movie again is the new 1492 Definitive Edition release out of Brazil. It is region 0 (1&4). It is to my knowledge the first widescreen release available in the U.S. <br />I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for a Paramount release. It was originally due 11/16/04, and now has been postponed indefinately. This Defintive Edition is highly recommended. Below is the original review of the movie itself. <br /> <br />**************************************************************** <br /> <br />The main reason I purchased this DVD was the character of Don Adrian de Moxica so skillfully portrayed by Michael Wincott. It was in my opinion the strongest performance in the entire movie, but unfortunately lasted a mere 35 minutes before....well I won't say in case you have not seen the movie yet.  <br /> <br />Aside from Wincott's stunning performance was that of Armande Assante who did an excellent job portraying Sanchez, council to Queen Isabel (Sigouney Weaver). Sadly the only reason I gave this movie four stars instead of five was the character of Columbus. I like Gerard Depardieu quite a bit but could not get past the French accent on the Italian explorer. Perhaps a better choice could have been made.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack in strong and moving. Vangelis' music fits perfecly with the gorgeous scenery through out the entire film. Lots of atmosphere.  <br /> <br />For reasons unknown, Paramount has opted to hold back the release of this film on DVD. Maybe because Christopher Columbus is deemed so 'Politically Incorrect' these days. Lesser films than this have gotten Paramount's royal treatment. I ended up purchasing a fairly decent release from Hong Kong. Unfortunatley it is full screen and I am unable to veiw the movie in all it's intended splendor, but it will have to do for now. <br />
B00008PC2O|5.0|If you buy this movie, you will put it in your most treasured DVD collection area, because it is the most incredible DVD made.  This is a man's movie.  It is loaded with action, awesome special effects, sould, story, plot, and originality.  Watch it as soon as you can.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|Do you like characters, interesting dialogue, and a solid plot? Keep looking. This was the cinematic equivalent to a hard punch in the stones. <br /> <br />I won't give the plot away, since a movie this gimmicky is (even more) worthless without its trifle \\"surprises,\\" but I'm disappointed director James Wan let the only two Asian characters face such trite fates. <br /> <br />Bah. The whole thing was trite. I hated this movie.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|It seems like people either hate this movie or really like, so it would probably good to rent it first.   <br />Michael Mann, I think, did a very good job with this movie.  The plot is very organized, the story is excellent, the action and speaking is very crispy, and the characters in the movie are very interesting.  Basically, I was blown away by this movie. <br />This movie has both equal elements of drama and action, but it is a perfect blend and flows very well.  The movie comes with two DVDs and the second DVD has some of the best behind the scenes footage that I have seen.  <br />A GOOD BUY
0393317552|5.0|It's been 2 years since I read this book but I find myself still recommending it to people who don't understand Prof. Diamond's premise.  I realize that much of this work has previously been covered in detail by other writers but Prof. Diamond does an excellent job of synthesizing the whole thesis of environmental advantage based on flora & fauna. <br /> <br />Critics of Prof. Diamond tend to focus on the lack of the human element but that only reinforces Diamond's thesis: that the human element would not have developed but for the prerequisite environmental advantages.  These critics' arguments may be more well founded with regard to Diamond's newest work \\"Collapse\\" with its focus smaller, less generalizable, civilizations.  Nevertheless, \\"Guns, Germs, & Steel\\" was a wonderfully thought-provoking book and I would highly recommend it to anyone with a strong interst in history and anthropology.
0141301155|4.0|As the title implies, this is the story of Charlie. Charlie Bucket is the only son of a very poor family. He lives in a very small cottage just outside of town, with his Mom and Dad, his two Grandmas and his two Grandpas.<br /><br />Charlie absolutely loves chocolate. Alas, his parents are so poor they can only afford to buy him a bar once a year, for his birthday, which is awaited eagerly. Needless to say that passing by Willy Wonka's enormous chocolate factory, the most famous in the world, on his way to school every day is close to torture for poor little Charlie.<br /><br />Until the day Charlie finds one in only five golden tickets in the whole world that entitles him to a visit of the reknown factory.<br /><br />I decided to read this book before Tim Burton's adaptation comes out. What a wonderful children story, full of adventures and twists and turns! The factory's a fantastic place, the characters are great, especially Grandpa Joe, and I'm looking forward to seeing the talented (among other qualities) Johnny Depp as Mr. Willy Wonka. And Quentin Blake's illustrations are excellent. Definitely something I'm going to read to my kids (when I have some). I ran to the shop right after I finished it to buy its sequel: Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator.
B000068CNX|5.0|The second season of Friends is arguably one of the best.  The Ross/Rachel storyline receives the most attention throughout the season, however, there are many other story arcs which help make the season extremely memorable (ex: Monica and Richard, Joey getting a job on Days of our Lives, Joey moving out of the apartment, etc.).  Every show makes me laugh out loud, which of course is the sign of a great comedy.  My favorite episodes in the second season are: <br />The One with Ross's New Girlfriend <br />The One with Phoebe's Husband <br />The One where Ross Finds Out <br />The One with the List <br />The One After the Super Bowl <br />The One with the Prom Video <br />The One where Ross and Rachel...You Know <br />The One where Eddie Won't Go <br />The One where Old Yeller Dies <br /> <br />Now I am anxiously awaiting the delivery of the third season!  :)
B00005JLYW|1.0|Can movies get any worse than this?  With Very Little actual plot line, the only thing left is a feminine butt kicking movie in which 3 strong women, who wear(it seems) Bikini's for half of the movie, are just going scene to scene kicking butt and blowing up stuff(sound familar people?). Its a movie that has been done before a 1000 times over in the past 10 years, and it is getting extremely old. Lets move on to something better.
6305313687|5.0|I know that this wasn't Norton's first work but this was my first E.N. film,and i have been tracked him ever since.Of course,Edward Norton is not the only thing that appeals to you in this movie:Edward Furlong is fine too;but the story is great,rough and makes you think while you make your way home in silence.A story about hate,partnership,death,regret and redemption.  But Edward Norton is the light that guides everything here,with a powerful acting (as usual),helped by those continuous flashbacks that help you understand the reasons why ,and changing wonderfully from full-colour to black and white and vice versa all the time.This is why you see the characters with a different look depending on the time the story is talking about.  After this one i have seen every film Norton has shown up in but Frida,and he is great.He deserves those 2 oscar- nominations and even more.He can play everything.  So if you want to enjoy a very good \\"old school\\" movie with great acting and a delicate subject get this one.You will not regret it.  Thank you all.
B0002B15WE|4.0|Die Hard is about a NY cop who goes to Los Angeles to meet with his wife only to find that highjackers have taken over the building that his wife is working at.  I find that this concept is simplistic but nevertheless a great way to make a movie.  Bruce Willis does a great job as the hero in action.  The script is well done and all supporting acting was a plus for the whole movie.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I have just seen this one for the second time,and i think that i've enjoyed it even more than when i went to the theatre almost a year and a half ago.I loved it then so much but now that i've read the novel too i understand it better and i can appreciate more  the features of the characters;you can even \\"dive\\" inside them,knowing how they feel at every moment,and that is something to be grateful. <br />I have always loved Penn's acting (one of my 5 favourites actors ever!)and the other 5 actors and actresses are brilliant too (i have to say that Laura Linney is a wonderful,talented as well as pretty actress too;she doesn't even appear but the time she stands in front of the camera worths every minute of it!),but what is almost new for me,unfortunately,of course,is the amazing talent of Clint Eastwood behind and in front of the camera (above all, taking into account that i still remember the marvellous \\"Million dollar baby\\" and all that it involves).The first half an hour is unbereable,talking in terms of strain and excitement,and the last one you can't even stay sitted on your couch! Everything in between is fine too. <br />I have missed Clint's work for very long time,so it's time now to recover his movies.The worst thing of it is that here in Spain we can't enjoy the 3 disc edition (you know,that encoding thing),so you americans enjoy it,lucky ones! <br />Thank you all for reading me and see \\"Million dollar baby\\" if you haven't yet! <br />Greetings from Spain.
B000002MP2|5.0|What more can be said about this CD? Along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" and Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" this is THE defining alternative rock disc of the 1990s.  One track after another of classic green day: buzzing guitars, tight bass, fast drums, and self-loathing lyrics of the boredom and confusion of growing up, delievered with the snotty angst of a young man trying to make sense of his suburban life.  Who among us can't relate to this? <br /> <br />Aside from the smash hits \\"Basket Case\\", \\"Longview\\" and \\"When I Come Around\\", there is \\"Burnout\\", the anthem for the bored teenager, \\"Coming Clean\\" an invitation for everyone to just come out of the closet, and the destructive edge of \\"Having A Blast\\" and \\"F.O.D\\".  Any snot-nosed, smart-mouth would love to deliever the classic line from \\"Chump\\" which goes \\"I dont know you, but I think I hate you.  You're the reason for my misery\\".  It just goes on and on.   <br /> <br />13 million people already own this CD, but if you dont, check it out.  Then go check out the very underrated \\"Insomniac\\" and of course, Green Day's most recent hit \\"American Idiot\\".
B00005JLO2|2.0|Watched this one, FOUR FEATHERS (2002), in anticipation of the re-release of the highly acclaimed 1939 version.  This one is ponderous, slow, and undercooked.  It contains one good battle scene, plunked in the middle, which is surrounded on both sides by an extremely plodding story of redemption.  Even the exciting battle scene is undermined by the film's insistence on casting its slow-mo eye on the superfluous.<br /><br />  1939's FOUR FEATHERS comes highly recommended and this one hasn't scared me off of it, but it certainly caused me to lower my expectations.
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you're sick of fake metal bands with no talent (Megadeth, 80s Metallica, Opeth, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Borknagar, Queensryche, etc - basically any of the crap that only posers praise) then you need to get this. They show so-called \\"metal\\" bands how to play REAL metal, and also that solos suck. This is MUCH better than anything those losers in the 80s could do. Once again unknown posers with guitars such as Malmsteen, Satriani, McLaughlin, Michael Romeo and Allan Holdsworth are shown how to actually play. This band is like sooooooo deep. Like Chester Bennington, I am a tortured artist; one too complex and intelligent to be understood by people who don't watch MTV or TRL. That's why I like MTV, because it caters to head-strong anti-mainstream rebels such as myself. So, if you are sick of fake \\"metal\\" from posers with long hair who don't know how to hold their instruments, then get this. If you want something just as deep that still rocks then get Good Charlotte.
B00025ETIW|4.0|I instantly fell in love with \\"Helena\\" after watching the video. It had a VERY catchy tune and the beginning is so ....\\"chilling\\" its hard to resist! I went to the Taste Of Chaos Tour concert about a week ago. My Chemical Romance played among The Used, Senses Fail, Killswitch Engage, and more. I was very happy to see the emotion the singer has when I saw him live. The very next day i bought the CD! I was sooooooo  happy to hear the same emotion I had heard live! I found out that there are also more great songs aside from \\"Helena\\" and \\"Im Not Okay (I promise)\\". \\"You know what they do to guys like us in prison\\" is also a favorite of mine. Overall, This CD is great, this BAND is awesome and it would be a great purchase. In fact, buy more than one! muahahahha......
B0006SSOHC|2.0|At first I really enjoyed this movie but the last half was okay and the ending was so excrucitaingly awful I fealt like I wasted an hour and a half just for a stupid ending like that.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I heard the song \\"American Idiot\\" and was HOOKED by its catchy tune! After buying the C.D. however, I have found thats not even the best song on the C.D.! I give this C.D. 5 stars because after hearing the whole album i instantly became a fan and went out and bought Green Day's \\"International Superhits\\". In my opinion, Any CD that can make you buy an earlier one, is a great one. Although I feel there music style changed a little from \\"Dookie\\" to \\"American Idiot\\", I feel the change was good. However i prefer thier older stuff. Anyway, Most of the songs on this CD will just stick in your head and you will find yourself singing them all over the place. The CD contains two, over 7 minute songs that almost give it a Bohemian Rapsody (didnt spell that right)feel. All of the songs are great on this cd, but my favorites are definately Holiday and Homecoming!!! BUY THIS!!!
B00005JNPZ|5.0|This is one of the few movies I had to see in the theatre twice. I  laughed at every joke and everything about this movie was real good.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is simply a beautifully done remake of Peter Pan, as the story is supposed to be told. A return to the original stage classic. I never really liked the Disney Peter Pan. I remember the old stage version put on television for years as a child...with Mary Martin in it, and though I loved that, when I read the original story, it was not supposed to be a musical.  <br /> <br />I've taken a real shine to the characters Jason Issacs play's. He seems to like to be the scoundrel in so many parts. His take on Darling and Captain Hook are exactly on cue...I laughed my head off through much of the tangles between Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and Hook, because Pan was the smart aleck kid who got the best of an arrogant Hook. The look on Hook's face when the croc comes around is great. He loses all sense of time, freezes, and there is a comic pathos there because he feels so sorry for himself! This part made me realize that Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies is played by this same man...what a change, from dark and hairy, to golden blonde. And what's fun is you despise Malfoy, but kind of feel sorry for Hook! <br /> <br />The original story was about growing up, and that in-between stage we all reach as pre-teens. The story was written in the early 1900's, and played on stage continually after that. It's amazing that 12 year old boys and girls in some ways remain constant...unfortunately, we allow them to lose their innocence too fast.  <br /> <br />My granddaughter adored this on cable...so I bought it for all of us to enjoy over and over again. This was a gem of a movie that got lost in the year it was released. But it obviously becoming a parental favorite, and for good reason.  <br /> <br />Karen Sadler
B000002UAX|5.0|Confession of an ex-heretic. I used to hate the beatles. <br />It was this album that made me fall in love with the beatles. I was going through an odd phase in life, that post high-school/pre-college search. Punk rock still held some sway for me, but I knew it was time to grow up a bit.  I began to buy tons of cheap used records from thriftstores, yknow the scratched up poor quality ones. One of the LPs i had bought was the white album and I fell in love with it. <br /> <br />I can't tell you a track on disc one that I don't like, but I can definitly tell you some of the ones I love. Dear Prudence is quite endearing to me. I love the sing-along-ability of The cont. story of Bungalow bill, and Happiness is a warm gun. Who doesnt enjoy While my guitar gently weeps?. I'm so Tired, Why don't we do it in the road?, Julia... Such a great slab of material. Nice and mostly downtempo with several upbeat(USSR, Don't pass me by) tracks and the bit of occaisonal absurdity(piggies). <br /> <br />Disc 2, well, there are a few tracks that I'm not absolutely ga-ga over, but that's not to say I dislike them. I'm not the biggest fan of Birthday(Dunno why) and Revolution9(Just never did much for me, and I like Ambiance quite a bit). Great, standout rock tracks here[Everybody's got something to hide, Helter Skelter(Spawned so many flaccid covers, though), and Savoy Truffle]. Some fantastic, fantastic slower tracks. Pauls\\"Mother Natures son\\", Johns\\"Cry baby cry\\", and Georges\\"Long long long\\"(which is heartwrenching) make up some of the must-listen songs. <br /> <br />Now, with the Beatles, is there any One album to own? No, I don't think so, they have so much great early, mid, and late material. I'm not even saying this is my favoite, as I don't know if I could honestly pick. But this was my first Beatles album to thouroughly be listened to and enjoyed by myself, so it will always have a spot in my heart and several smiles on my face.Great soundtrack for soulsearching from 4 gentlemen that where still trying to find themselves as they grew apart.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This was absolutely the worst movie from all aspects.  Cannot believe Julie Roberts would be in a movie of this type, class and poor 'story'.  It's sexual content is meaningless and in poor moral taste.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND ABOVE ALL DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B000002TP7|5.0|Favorite B-boys by far.  I hear or read where so many people say that they feel there are too many directions on this album, but honestly, that's why I like it. B-boys used to be a bunch of skate-punks back in the day so i'm glad they stuck w/ some of the heaviness like in Check Your head, and I also love that they shifted gears w/ the hip-hop getting a bit more serious.  The Album is almost layed out like how I would make a Mix-tape or comp for a friend. Having different types of songs next to each other as opposed to hears the Hardcore section, now heres the instrumentals, now here are the Hip-hop cuts.  The first 7 tracks are sheer genius.     Some of my favorites would have to be 'B-boys making w/ the freak-freak,''Root Down,''Sabotage(of course, it's a great song damnit),''Get it together(awesome awesome track w/ q-tip and the Biz),''Flute Loop(Nice short and powerful),''Do it(love the growls),' and 'Shambala/Bodhisatva Vow(these two really take the cake for me, can't get enough of the Funky/soul guitar,drum and bass in shambala that mixes in w/ the chanting thats in both tracks).'     Anyway, I think its the multiple styles that helped to win over alot of the B-boys current fanbase. Still the oldschool NYHC sensibilities, mixed with the jazzy snippets(Yauch using an Upright bass on alot of the tracks is sheer genius, amazing), and their new approach at rap/hip-hop. The common sense to keep these styles seperate also helps, as oppose to trying to make individul songs with elements from all of these help.  This album definitly helped to broaden my musical soundscapes.  I could listen to more hip-hop after this and more metered, instrumentation as well. Thank you B-boys for opening my eyes.
B000003TA4|5.0|There isn't all that much new that you can say about Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" that hasn't already been said. So this review is more like a review/essay.<br /><br />The hype and mystique surrounding this album is all true. It did change the face of rock, and along with Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" was the songbook that most popular 90s bands borrowed from.<br /><br />So much has been written about Kurt Cobain, his life, his suicide, Courtney, Courtney/Grohl feud, etc., that's it's easy to forget what all started the hype in the first place. Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" is undoubtedly one of the greatest rock albums of-all-time. From the classic intro of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" to the subdued closing \\"Something In the Way,\\" every song is both instantly memorable and brilliant. There isn't a single bad song on this disc. \\"Nevermind\\" is like a greatest hits in of itself.<br /><br />What made this album so great was that the music was punk, but also had a pop-sensibility with infectious hooks and killer riffs. In this sense, you kind of get the best of both worlds--the raw anger and energy of Black Flag, and The Dead Kennedy's, but also the melody and harmony of The Beatles.<br /><br />If you were born shortly before or after the death of Kurt Cobain, it's hard to imagine how revolutionary this CD was. When \\"Nevermind\\" exploded, it drew the line in rock. Bands that were otherwise obscure (Mudhoney, L7, Screaming Trees) were signed to major labels and enjoyed radio-play. Alternative bands that had been around for a few years that were already signed (Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Alice In Chains) became huge overnight. The early 90s was a really exciting time in rock. Radio had been infested with the likes of Slaughter and Trixter, and, for a while, everything was new and fresh.<br /><br />The only real drawback for me is that the revolution of \\"Nevermind\\" made people close minded about bands they had only just recently loved. Although it is a blessing that some of these bands were shown the door, i.e., Slaughter, a lot of good bands were discarded and trashed rightfully or not. \\"Nevermind\\" was certainly the death nail to all old-school rock. Most of these bands were killed overnight.<br /><br />In conclusion, fourteen years after its release, \\"Nevermind\\" often emulated, never duplicated, is still one of the best albums of all-time and belongs in every rock collection.ands were shown the door, i.e., Slaughter, a lot of good bands were discarded and trashed rightfully or not. \\"Nevermind\\" was certainly the death nail to all old-school rock.

B00004U2GH|5.0|This album is Amazing, This and Cash's Folsom prison album rank up there as 2/3 of the best live albums ever, the other slot belonging to James Browns original Live at the Apollo. <br /> <br />Geez, where to start, the original of this was great, just the energy put into the banter alone was great, but this new expanded, uncut edition, w/ ALL the songs is fantastic. Frantic energy, slower, calm down tracks, and jabs at the powers that be. Johnny was amazing. The greats like (a very energetic) Folsom prison Blues, Ring of Fire, and I walk the line, mixed with the not so common to obscure tracks.  <br /> <br />Some of the tracks I am most fond of are the two takes on the San Quentin song( took gusto to do this song or at least attempt it twice), the Starkville City Jail, Wanted Man(Co-penned w/ Bob Dylan), Boy named Sue( written by Shel Silverstein, yea, The Giving Tree and Where the Sidewalk Ends, childrens author) and Daddy Sang Bass( w/ the vocal help of the Statler brothers). <br /> <br />Check this out for the great live performance. Johnny at one of his heights.  I especially like how The Live at Folsom Prison album, which was not released that much earlier than this has an almost completely track list with it's one unique batch of songs.  Check out Live at San Quentin and Live at Folsom prison for two of the best Live albums you'll ever hear. Buy them seperate, dont buy that disc w/ both original recordings, buy the new ones that are uncut for the full effect. <br /> <br />Don't like Country you say?  <br />Guess what, I don't either, but these are truly some of the best albums ever produced and recorded live.
B00003CXCT|2.0|All right, here we go.  Yet another rant, I'm afraid, that will fall on deaf ears.  I'm 34 years old, and was 6 when the original \\"Star Wars\\" movie came out.  They say that \\"you like best what you see first\\", and I'm sure that there's some truth in that.  Personally, I don't like what Lucas has done to one of my favorite films.  But let's take a bigger-picture view of this, and let's put aside what he's done to \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Return Of The Jedi\\".  They were, after all, just sequels.  Relax... I know \\"Empire\\" is an extraordinarily good sequel, but it IS still just a sequel. <br />   <br />The original \\"Star Wars\\" is a bona-fide film classic.  Forget my personal opinion.  There're 30 trillion \\"personal opinions\\" available on the Web; who the hell is going to care about mine?  I'm talking HISTORY here: \\"Gone With The Wind\\", \\"King Kong\\", \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"... you don't go back and mess with these classic films just because you CAN.  Does the stop-motion \\"King Kong\\" truly represent what the filmmakers had intended, or would they have PREFERRED to make Kong look more real and menacing, but simply lacked the technology?  When George Lucas says his new edition of \\"Star Wars\\" more closely represents what he WOULD have done in 1977 if he'd had the resources, I have to say \\"WHO CARES?!\\"  The fact is, the original \\"Star Wars\\" doesn't belong to George Lucas anymore.  Or it shouldn't, anyway.  As of May 25, 1977, when he put it out into the world, it became the property of the fans.  And Lucas has stolen it away from us.   What would George Lucas himself say, I wonder, if the estate of Willis O'Brien had been given instructions (before his death in 1962) for the old special effects in \\"King Kong\\" to be destroyed and replaced with new, more convincing effects when the technology improved?  What if we were never again able to view \\"King Kong\\" as it had played in its original release?  It would be a cinematic tragedy.  And I'm willing to bet money that George Lucas himself would object to that, even if it had been the intention of the original filmmakers! <br /> <br />But enough about all that.  Let's pretend that this version of the \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" actually deserves a place on your DVD shelf.  To add insult to injury, the quality control on these DVDs is TERRIBLE.  I'm a professional feature-film Director of Photography, and I've been through the process of transferring and mastering films for DVD release many times.  I know when a sub-standard job has been done on the transfer.  For one thing, the black levels are often WAY too low.  A significant amount of shadow detail has disappeared entirely!  For example, you can barely see the TIE fighters in the asteroid chase in \\"Empire\\"!  Now, I like dark.  I was the DP on \\"Groove\\", and we made that sucker DARK in its DVD release, but these black levels are ridiculous, and do NOT accurately re-create the original cinematic experience.  And it's not as if it's ALL too dark, so that you can compensate by turning up the BRIGHTNESS setting on your TV.  The X-Wings flown by Luke and Wedge are glowing too brightly as Luke declares he's going in \\"full throttle\\" over the Death Star; the snow on Hoth is blowing out the highlight detail during the AT-AT attack; Han, Leia, Chewy, and 3-PO are completely \\"blooming\\" with over-exposure as Han declares \\"never tell me the odds\\" in the asteroid chase.  It's all over the proverbial map.  (And don't worry--I know how to set up my monitor; there's no problem there!)  The work is so shoddy and uneven, my normally idealistic brain (I really DO like to give people the benefit of the doubt) can't help but wander into cynical territory: Lucasfilm MUST be making this DVD release intentionally sub-standard so that we'll want to buy the next re-release of the trilogy (probably on the upcoming HD-DVD format), which will undoubtedly have even MORE changes to our beloved films! <br /> <br />In my opinion, the \\"powers that be\\" did NOT troubleshoot this release thoroughly enough.  In the first film alone, the opening \\"Star Wars\\" title recedes MUCH too quickly into the distance (compared to all previous incarnations, and all sequels); the Star Destroyer in the opening shot is firing WHITE lasers instead of green (because someone involved with the film restoration forgot to complete this particular effects element); the dialogue quality is all over the map (witness the conversation between Leia and Han after escaping the Death Star: the sound levels and hiss are incredibly uneven) despite the fact that we have amazing amounts of \\"sweetening\\" technology at our fingertips. <br /> <br />Why does the public accept such a shoddy release?  What choice do we have?  It's not as if George Lucas is EVER going to admit an error.  He's the \\"George Bush\\" of film directors.  It's a shame that the fate of one of the most beloved films of all time is in the hands of someone like him. <br /> <br />But, go ahead and buy it anyway.  The original trilogy WAS truly great, and this is all we're ever going to get... unless Lucas finally listens to the OVERWHELMING public opinion in favor of releasing the original, and that simply ain't gonna happen.
B000002HMH|4.0|I feel inclined to review this album, because the truth of the matter is, Load really is a great album as it stands. But I have to say I was disappointed at the time of it's release, because I remember coming home with this album...with the bloody semen on the cover and the word \\"Metallica\\" on it I thought it would sound pretty ferocious, but it just turns out to be just a decent bluesy alternative rock album. I admit that it's endearing to hear an aging metal band that actually sounds their age. Consider this: Would you rather hear solid bluesy alternative metal (Load) or a bunch of old farts trying unsuccessfully to \\"rock\\" like they used to (see St. Anger). What exactly does it take to please you people anyway? You don't like Load cause it's mature and softer? Listen to the songs, dammit! There's a lot of great melodies all over this album. It's not pefect, of course, and it's too bluesy for my tastes, but any day I'll take this album over AC/DC's Ballbreaker (which is TRUELY terrible watered down blues rock album). Just in case you haven't noticed, James Hetfeild, for some reason, sometimes feels the need to add an extra syllable to every word. \\"Until it Sleeps-ah\\"! Yeah, he does that on the earlier stuff a little bit, but on this album it's like an overdose of unnecesary syllables. It's pretty annoying but I've gotten used it somehow. Load is very very underrated. Load was *much* better than both Re-Load and St. Anger. There are definatly some lame songs on here though. \\"Poor Twisted Me\\" is one of the worst songs they've ever written. \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" is boring, and surely a blueprint for the flatland of awkward riffs that Re-Load would be. \\"Ronnie\\", and \\"The Cure\\" are both mediocre bluesy rock songs that don't really go anywhere. Those 4 are the only bad songs on here. The production is really great. Everything's loud and clear, and the band is remarkably flexible throughout most of the album. \\"Mama Said\\", the sole calssic folk song that can found on this album, is beautiful. If you don't have a soft spot for folksy ballads, you might want to skip that one though. I still think it's really pretty. \\"Hero Of the Day\\" is really pretty too. My favorite songs here are stuff like, \\"The House Jack Built\\" and \\"Bleeding Me\\". Those are some very powerful, dark, and blistering atmospheric blues metal songs. Listen to it, turn it up. It's no Ride the Lightning, but it sure does rock.
B00005JNEW|5.0|I saw this right after prom ended last night. it was midnight and I was tired. It woke me up the moment I saw Tim MCgraw on the screen. I think I spelled his name wrong. Oh well. His performace was great and stood right next to Billy Bob Thornton's. To be honest, I think everyone gave a good performance. This movie is up there with remember the titans.
B0007TKH66|4.0|Enterprise admittedly got off to a slow start and, yes it spent far too long in the \\"expanse\\".  The cast and acting on the show were always excellent.  By the 4th, and unfortunately last, year the writing finally caught up.  Then, in an obvious move to kill the show, UPN moved it to the 8:00 Friday time slot against Star Gate.  Even though the show struggled to find itself, it was still very, very good.  Given the chance to continue, future years could have been excellent.  I will definely purchase the Season 1 DVDs and pray that they will issue the other 3 years.  Try it you'll like it. <br />Oh!, note to Sci-Fi channel, why don't you pick it up for a 5th season?  It would be a heck of a lot better than that horrible Battlestar Galactia.
B00005JMJG|2.0|The people who liked this probably liked it because of its suffocating sense of its own artiness, while completely overlooking the fact that there is not one likeable character in the movie. Just because a film is arty does not mean it is good (more often the reverse). <br /> <br />This movie is pap. Unpleasant and unlikeable.
B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath's third album was released in the summer of 1971, which was right in the middle of an era of great classic hard rock. This record pulverised the competiton, no other band this early was this heavy! Where could they go from 'Paranoid'? Well let's just say the ante was upped to leave no doubts who were the kings of heavy metal. Purple and Zeppelin were never this lethal, case in point, Zep III's acousticness and Purple's 'Fireball' including the folksy \\"Anyone's Daughter\\". Sabbath applied the boot to your head and crushed you with Iommi's most monsterous riffs to date. The lp is all killer and no filler, five monoliths to death and destruction (and smoking bones), plus two brief instrumentals and one mellow dirge. \\"Sweet Leaf\\" kicks off the proceedings in fine fashion, the riff of all riffs and a tribute to getting high, not exactly a say no to drugs anthem. \\"Children of the Grave\\" is another insane classic with its rumbling beat and malevolent inevitablity, the future is not bright. \\"Lord of this World\\" is probably one of Sabbath's very few actual satanic songs considering their reputation but you can't help banging your head to it. \\"After Forever\\" is a great song about Catholicism of all things, so these two songs are polar opposites in subject matter. You can't brand Sabbath as anti or pro God, that's too simple for a band that isn't as simple as their detractors point out. One last bit of praise for the mightiest of all Tony Iommi's compositions, \\"Into the Void\\". If this song doesn't define heavy metal for all time then I guess I don't know what metal is. All members give flawless efforts, has Ozzy ever sounded better or loonier? He does sing \\"Solitude\\" by the way but I don't why several Amazon reviews claim it is Bill Ward (kinda dumb when you think about it). Notch number three for a band that after Zeppelin is the greatest in the history of heavy rock. Could someone please tell me why these guys are not in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Shame.... er Fame??? That is a travesty!
B000002H2H|4.0|FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE- a great opener, suberb riffs from james 9.5/10<BR>RIDE THE LIGHTNING- all around awesome song, drags on a little long 9.3/10<BR>FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS- a great track, awesome lyrics and riffs 9.9/10<BR>FADE TO BLACK- the best track on the cd by far. 10/10<BR>TRAPPED UNDER ICE- a good song, just not their best 8.8/10<BR>ESCAPE- another well done song, not a great hit with me 7.9/10<BR>CREEPING DEATH- awesome song, lyrics/riffs all good 9.1/10<BR>THE CALL OF KTULU- very well done, nice closer 9.4/10
B00005JMFQ|1.0|This film is awful.  It's every wretched tic that writer/director Richard Curtis has picked up over the years rolled humorlessly and artlessly into one package.  The film looks and feels like a department store advertisement.  And note how almost every character has the same voice, and that that voice is in fact that of Hugh Grant's character Charlie from _4 weddings_ (Compare Curtis here with David Kelley who wrote every character on _Ally McBeal_ with the same Ally-voice).  Horrible.  Seriously, often film-makers with considerable gifts eventually make the franken-film in which they confirm every critical doubt about their talent- this is Curtis's, \\"Shadows and Fog\\" is Woody Allen's, \\"Storytelling\\" is Solondz's, and so on.  Romantic Comedy is a genre that is dear to many of us, for excellent reasons.  LA, however, marks the arrival of self-important bombast to the genre - it's the _Pearl Harbor_ or _Armageddon_ (\\"the ultimate\\") of rom coms - and is cause for despair (both about the people who made it and the people who profess to like it).    So... here's a movie that a lot of people are going to watch as a \\"date\\" movie.  One of you is almost certainly going to react allergically to the thing, whereas the other might be able to stand it (don't ask me how), and they're going to be ticked off at the allergically reacting one's carping (e.g., anyone with experience of Curtis's earlier works will find themselves involuntarily slipping into _Black Adder_ hyperbole: \\"I would rather eat a pile of pig manure with a caviar spoon than watch another second.....\\").  Oh yes, love will be all around that night.  Do yourself a favor and watch instead any of the many Jane Austen flicks out there if you need a \\"giddy round of couples\\" fix.

1592400876|5.0|Who would believe that a book on the dry subject of punctuation good be written with so much style and so humorously?  Although quite \\"British\\" in style, this book will appeal to anyone who enjoys the English langauge.
1577311523|1.0|I bought this book after reading the beginning in which Mr. Tolle relates his sublime spiritual experience, only to discover later that he never writes personally again.  I wish I'd bought a book by a Native American mystic that now looks so much more honest. <br /> <br />Now -- I know, my exasperation, my discomfort with the moment is my summons for an unveiling of the unconscious, and I'm probably no better an artist at this unveiling than Mr. Tolle, for afterall, it's a crucifixion, and I'm not saying this as a Christian (I'm not a Christian but rather a Deist), I speak only as one who recognizes the Way that's been modeled for us in the West is one of ultimate sacrifice, \\"public crucifixion followed by private resurrection.\\"  And to deny this and to seek to go back to the Way and forms of the East and of indigenous cultures is a regression. <br /> <br />Of course it's not that simple -- or is it?  I have been very moved by Krishnamurti's story and his struggles, and by Thomas Merton, but even they stop revealing the personal after a time, it simply becomes too much of a struggle.  Perhaps one feels one must hold something back for the last years. <br /> <br />The whole issue of becoming a spokesman for God (Being in Mr. Tolle's definition), a world saviour, is a fascinating one.  Obviously, most fail. Yet these failures should tell us great stories, and I haven't found that in \\"The Power of Now.\\"  I'd rather meet a Jim Jones any day, at least he's not boring.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Not getting a chance to listen to De-loused I picked this up on a whim (and many positive reviews). I gotta say, it was staggering at first. The energy and intensity that goes into each and every one of these pieces (yes, even \\"The Widow\\", which is actually one of my favorites on \\"the Mute\\") is awe inspiring. Whether it's the sporadic guitar and drum work in \\"Cygnus\\" or the latin kick in \\"L'Via\\" every song (if you can call them songs) has it's own personality and, as I said, degree of intensity. <br /> <br />However, there are a few things on this CD that make it less than perfect, and I'm sad to say that I have to agree with many of the negative reviews, but not to the point of hating the album. <br /> <br />In actuality the ONLY thing I had a problem with was the extended use of sound effects. However, don't let the other reviews throw you off. It by no means ruins the album: there's plenty here to listen to even if you don't want to sit through the sound effects. What I do think, is that they DO go on too long on many of the songs. For instance, on \\"The Widow\\" almost the entire second half is sound effects. Normally, sound effects don't bother me...but then again, sound effects in songs don't usually go on for more than 30 seconds. When a song has over a minute of sound effects, something should change. It becomes...for lack of a better word, \\"not\\" music. What's even worse with the Mars Volta's sound effects is that they really don't fit with the mood of their songs. \\"Cygnus\\" for instance, is a high energy piece, but the end (and by end, i mean the last three minutes) is laid back sound effects. It has absolutely no bering on the actual song. <br /> <br />I hate to bring up Pink Floyd, but the comparison seems almost inevitable. If the Mars Volta could figure out a way to incorporate the sound effects into the song, such as Floyd, and actually keep a beat around it (or anything music oriented for that matter) a greater portion of each of their songs would not bethrow away. They sometimes just seem like they're too bombastically trying to reinevent music. If they could just realize that they ARE reinventing music with their actual music, things would turn out a lot better. <br /> <br />Again, if my negatives seemed a little too harsh for my grade, I didn't mean for it to. This is a wonderful album, and I can't wait for their next project. Long live the AFRO!
B00005JNDZ|1.0|I rather enjoyed the first movie and had no qualms about renting its sequel...that was my first mistake. When will I learn that all sequels are generally crap? I get my self all exited only to be let down.  There's nothing new in this movie. No character growth, no original ideas, and no humour. Okay maybe a little humour if you can call it that. Being British myself, I can only describe this as Americas view on British people in general. We're not all dithering idiots that use the word shag in every other sentence.  Bridget has transcended into a paranoid, annoying and embarrassing individual and not in the cute way so much as you want to slap her for being so ignorant. The witty dialogue in the first film has been replaced with rather pathetic physical comedy that induces nausea. Its so unrealistic. And the whole Thai jail thing? Well that plot was lifted from a film called Broke down palace, with Clair Danes. That was crap as well. You'd think they'd take a hint. Colin Firth plays Fitzwilliam Darcy in the 21st century yet again. Personally I'm tired of seeing him play the same character in every film. Kind of like Sandra Bullock (you know its true). I didn't mind Hugh Grant, but that was probably because he had the most amusing lines. I just hope he expands to more then his two I'm a total sex rogue\clueless dopey English guy from Notting Hill roles. As for comparisons from the first movie <br /> <br />1. Jones lands bottom first on camera. Check <br />2. Cleaver remarks on how urr..appropriate her mini skirt is. Check <br />3. Darcy's in a stupid Jumper. Check <br />4. Darcy and Cleaver have another fight, only this time its totally unfunny because we've seen it all before. Check. Playing horrific music from The Darkness doesn't help <br />5. The big knickers have there come back. Check <br />6. Jones makes total fool of herself in front of a crowd of haughty tautys. Check except this time its not endearing because she's become a total twit <br /> <br />There'smore but I need to wrap things up. Basically Jones has gone from a rather amusing character into a paranoid, stupid git that doesn't think before she starts spouting total tosh and revealing herself to be no good for anyone really. Being a woman myself, I think she gives us a bad name. Perhaps men like blond, ditsy, insecure, jealous woman because it makes them feel intelligent and in control. I don't know. I have one more gripe: the making fun and stereotyping of the Thai woman in jail was totally wrong. And Bridget giving the `men are from Mars, woman are from Venus' books was stupid. Plus if the title was in English I'm assuming the books were as well so how the hell are they supposed to read it anyway. Perhaps I'm just too picky. If you're looking for some good English humour, try Fry & Laurie, French & Saunders, Absolutely Fabulous and The Vicar of Dibly. I enjoyed the lesbian scene though. It was the only plot point that I didn't see coming from a mile off. Cute!  <br />
B00005V9IL|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, as Im not big on sci-fi. The movie for the first 2 hours is good, but the last 45 minutes is intense and emotional and just very good, and I truly enjoyed it. Someone stated over dramatic, but its not, its a true interpetation of life and the way people are. This movie was not boring , it was interesting and not once did I doubt this flick. Its a solid movie everything blends well together. This isnt a horror type science fiction but more of a drama-action type. If you like dramas,actions and sci-fi, check this flick out and for only $10 in your local video store or here on amazon its well worth the $$$$ and a movie i will without a doubt watch from time to time. If you dont want to buy it rent it its worth a viewing. As I said im not big on sci-fi but do beleive in  other life somewhere in the galaxy be it space, or even water. We cant go down 25,000 feet so you never know what is down there it gets you thinking whcih is very cool. You have to have an open mind when viewing this.
B000069HJL|4.0|Paris is a great live disc but one of Supertramp's most rocking songs (Goodbye stranger) is missing although sure it was performed in the concert. Instead of this cool song we've got average material like A Soapbox Opera or the non stellar You Started Laughing. Other than that, I have no complaints about this cd. The group plays tight, the quality sound is very good and the songs have more power and life to them than in the generally inferior studio renditions.    Too bad that the footage of this gig is not available (We are teased with some of it on the Story So Far video and dvd). It must be great.    This is Supertramp at the height of their power and popularity. After this recording, nothing would be the same and they'd fall in the downhill slide with the Famous Last Words cd and from which they would never recover.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie was a creeper.  From just lookin at the box I expected another nerd movie.  I was so pleasantly surprised when I watched this film.  It is just clean humor.  FYI---There is another scene after the credits roll....that is a must SEE.<br /><br />I think this movie is enjoyable for everyone in the family, young and old :-)
B000007492|4.0|Supertramp was another one of those bands that I had no idea how many good and recognizable songs they had until I got this collection. I mean half of these songs could be on the radio at any given time. Songs you've heard your whole life, and might know the words to, but didn't know it was Supertramp. They may be hard to catagorize, but they were everywhere in the late 70's and early 80's. Included here are numerous hits, but my favorites are \\"The Logical Song\\", \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Give A Little Bit\\", and \\"It's Raining Again\\". \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" is another great one also. If you know any of these songs, you should like them all.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|I watched the film and didn't believe a bit of it. Three wildly-beautiful people in a film about the Old South in the Civil War? Nonsense.<br /><br />The actors are too winning to be real- we need ugly ones or at least no-so-good loking ones to be character actors. People like Robert Duvall; not so good looking, but he can act.<br /><br />Mingella loves glamor, loves scope- but this was the wrong subject, wrong time, and definitly the wrong place in history. Stick to the 1950's Jazz scene, Tony.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|Possibly Van Halen's best record, and definitely their best with David Lee Roth. \\"1984\\" was another highlight of the Dave years, but this 1978 album is incredible. As much as it unleashed the band on the world, it also sent Eddie Van Halen to the top of the guitar god list. You can hear half of this on the radio on any given day. Hits included are \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\", \\"You Really Got Me\\", \\"Aint Talkin' 'Bout Love\\", \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\", and the still amazing \\"Eruption\\". And the rest is nearly as sweet. This debut was simply Dave's best, as Sammy's best with them was \\"5150\\". Overall an essential rock record.
B000003TA4|1.0|<br />Nirvana was a load of bullsh*t. So was Grunge: It was just an excuse to sound like crap. Nirvana, along with their other so-called \\"Alternative\\" brethren were Arena Rockers; the only difference between them and Bon Jovi was that Nirvana never washed their hair. Kurt Cobain was in such denial about everything. He refused to admit he was an unfit junkie parent, and he also refused to admit he was mainstream. Cobain never had any message; he just randomly mumbled words slurred together. Fans just wish the lyrics could pertained to their own lives. <br /> <br />Here are some better, equally-polished albums from bands that just as good live as they are in the studio (unlike Nirvana)... <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins: Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness <br />The Offspring: Smash  <br />Green Day Nimrod <br />
0743454529|3.0|I am not surprised to see that many of the five star reviews are written by women, this story is estrogen rich.  Definitely designed to tug the heart strings, the story is engrossing. However, a good story is not the sum total of writing.    I found much of the language overwrought; a package of Oreo cookies makes its \\"suicide plunge\\" down a vending machine chute (oh, come on!).  The teen-age characters talk like thirty-year olds, and the male and female voices are interchangeable.  Although each character has a section set aside to him or her, the voices are close to identical.    The ending is a cheap, theatrical, made for t.v. movie ending as is popular with a certain type of fiction today.  It it remniscent of the headlines on the tabloids at the check out counter.    When I read the reviews it occurs to me that no one dared objectively review a book that dealt with a very tough subject.
B00005JNTV|5.0|Sin City is an excellent movie with a great cast and a great story, actually 3 stories combined that makes one of the best movies of the year so far. Props to everyone.
B0000009TJ|5.0|I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Man, do I miss Frank (I guess it is a one shot deal). But this is the next best thing to having him back amongst us. It is simply the best live music Frank ever set down. It is amazing, and gets more impressive each time I listen to it. Buy now. Don't wait.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I made my friends go INSANE because all I could sing was I'm Not Okay!  If you are having thoughts about this CD, I say BUY IT!!!  These songs are really good and so much emotion is in the lyrics.  Gerard's voice really brings out these songs to where you want to put it on Repeat.   <br /> <br />My favorite songs have to be You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison, I'm Not Okay (I promise), Helena, Ghost of You, and I Never Told You What I Do For A Living.  These songs are VERY well written and really sung well. <br /> <br />So I tell you, listen to the samples of these songs.  You will see what i'm talking about.  These guys are very talented and will be making it BIG in no time.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|There's been a lot of confusion over the tracks and how they map to the CD indexes.  The correct track listing is as follows:    1.  Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus (13:02)  2.  The Widow (5:50)  3.  L'Via L'Viaquez (12:21)  4.  Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore (13:09)  5-12.  Cassandra Gemini (32:31)    In other words, the only track broken into separate CD tracks is \\"Cassandra Gemini.\\"  To increase confusion, it's broken into 8 track (5-12), yet the booklet lists 5 sub-sections of the song.  These obviously do not map appropriately.  The CD artwork also incorrectly lists the song as \\"Geminni\\" instead of \\"Gemini.\\"  This was corrected on the vinyl 2LP release.    Adding yet more confusion, the CD DataBase (CDDB) and Gracenote (used by RealPlayer, Winamp, Windows Media Player, etc. to identify tracks on your computer) has the CD tracks listed wrong, e.g. using the sub-sections of \\"Miranda\\" as separate CD tracks.  This is incorrect.  \\"Miranda\\" in only track 4.  The lyrics in the CD booklet confirm this.
B0000025KI|4.0|I agree with a previous review that said The River contains some of the best and worst Springsteen songs released. For the most part, this album has some solid songs. <br /> <br />The Best (IMO): <br />1. Hungry Heart <br />2. Point Blank <br />3. Fade Away <br />4. The River <br />5. The Ties that Bind <br />6. Out in the Street <br /> <br />The Worst (IMO): <br />1. Crush on You <br />2. Sherry Darling <br />3. I Wanna Marry You <br />4. I'm a Rocker <br /> <br />Despite the filler songs on this album, I'd still recommend The River.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|If you enjoy watching talking heads and a lot of self-inflicted sturm et drang, then this movie is for you.  Unfortunately, sometimes even the talented stumble - and this abysmal attempt at movie-making is a big stumble by Mike Nichols et al.  It's a high-brow attempt at low-brow \\"real life\\" perambulations, and it comes off as artificial as that sounds. <br /> <br />The dialogue is stilted - sometimes because of the script, but also sometimes because of the direction.  Even simple lines sound artificial.  Natalie Portman is terribly miscast.  Never for a moment do you believe she is really a stripper.  I can almost see how that character would be in real life -- tough, tender, jaded, wounded.  Not a young girl wearing a lot of wigs. <br /> <br />Good movies let you see the inner workings of the characters' minds.  You see them think, strategize, and ultimately change, for better or worse.  Not in this movie.  You don't know why so-and-so falls for another, or why so-and-so can't be faithful.  There is no -- I repeat -- NO passion, except for anger, despite all the couplings.  The only character that seems to come to life is Clive Owen's, who at least seems to have a character with a story arc.  As one reviewer noted, it's fun to watch him yell.  He, at least, shows passion. <br /> <br />Otherwise, the actions of the characters are inscrutible, based on secrets we are not privy to.  I suppose all the frank sex talk was shocking at one time to theatre goers (this was first a play), but someone forgot that in movies, frank sexual confrontations are the norm.  Yawn.  You never understand the characters' motives, and you finish the movie understanding no more than when you started.  What's the point? <br />
B000002BFL|2.0|I've been a Bruce Springsteen fan for most of my life, but I really can't get into this album. Folks, it's not his best album (that would be either Born in the USA or Darkness on the Edge of Town) nor is it a classic. Youngstown is a great song, but the rest of this album isn't that great. One review said that this album was \\"the best driving music ever made\\". Trust me, if you listened to this album while driving, you'd fall asleep at the wheel.  <br /> <br />If you want a great acoustic album by The Boss, check out Nebraska, one of the best ever made. The Ghost of Tom Joad pales in comparison. <br /> <br />I've heard a lot of comparisons between The Ghost of Tom Joad and The Boss's latest album, Devils and Dust. For the sake of Bruce fans everywhere, let's hope those comparisons are false.
B000065U1N|4.0|We'll never fully understand what it means to serve in the armed forces unless we've actually done it. But if you want some insight, or if you're a 17-year-old high school kid thinking about joining as a way to make a living, check out \\"Black Hawk Down.\\" I've talked about this with my dad (who watched the movie with me), an Army chaplain who just finished a tour in Iraq. Sure, you get training, benefits and help paying for college - but when you hold up your right hand and take the soldier's oath, you join the Army we have, not the Army you might want to be part of or that we hope to have at a later time (apologies to Rumsfeld), and you put your individual needs aside for the sake of the mission and the soldiers with whom you serve.<br /><br />The movie is a gritty portrayal of a \\"home-in-an-hour\\" mission that unraveled into the chaos of a 15-hour urban gun battle. Like another reviewer noted, the soldiers in \\"Black Hawk Down\\" didn't choose where they went, nor were they asked about their opinion of our involvement in Somalia before being sent there. Then when they got there, they acted with courage. Why? I'll sum it up in one line from the movie: \\"It's about the guy next to you.\\" Our political leaders acted like bean-counting cowards, and 18 soldiers paid with their lives just so they could \\"leave no man behind.\\"<br /><br />I haven't read Mark Bowden's book, but the film version is extremely worth as a work of art. I had to take off one star because there's a newer edition of the DVD with more documentaries and other extras.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I'm not a big Green Day fan, but I really like this album. The songs on American Idiot are in-your-face rock. The top songs on this album (IMO) are American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Give Me Novacaine.
B00005JNTV|5.0|As you have probably heard, Sin City is based off of Frank Miller's \\"Graphic\\" novels, and yes, graphic is a very good word to describe this movie.  The movie takes place in a fictional city, maybe nieghboring Gotham City or Metropolis.  However this city does not have any real heros, per se, there are a few good-doers, but they are also crooks (with the exception of Bruce Willis' character, John Hartigan).  This city has been overrun by corruption and director Robert Rodriguez does a great job of creating a digital atmosphere of the City. <br /> <br />For the most part, this movie plays out like a Quentin Tarentino film.  The movie consists of three stories, which are not in chronological order, that eventually intertwine with eachother.  The first of those stories is about aging cop John Hartigan trying to save young Nancy Callahan from a serial rapist.  Hartigan gets betrayed by his partner (Michael Madsen) and is set-up for the kidnapping and an alleged rape.  This story concludes at the end of the movie.  <br /> <br />The second story revolves around Marv (Mickey Rourke).  Marv is a big, ugly guy that has a beautiful girl come into his life one day and he can't figure out why.  Well, she is murdered and Marv is set-up for the crime.  This eventually spirals into Marv going on a hunt for the person who killed his \\"angel\\".  The hunt leads him to the home of a Senator and the most powerful priest in town.  With the help of some of the town's female escorts, Marv eventually gets face to face with the killer of his \\"angel\\" for a showdown. <br /> <br />The female escorts also help out Dwight (Clive Owen) in the thrid story.  Dwight becomes involved with a waitress (Brittany Murphy) and has to deal with her one-time companion Jack (Benicio Del Toro), who is the type of guy that always has a posse follow him around for protection purposes.  Now a chase that leads into the Escort's side of town endangers a truce that was made with the Mob and the police.  Its Dwight's job to try to prevent this truce from ending and to prevent a sort of \\"mob war\\". <br /> <br />All of the actors do a pretty good job with the roles they are given and seem to be comfortable playing those characters.  Marv is the character with the most depth of any of the many characters.  As mentioned earlier, Rodriguez has done a great job with this movie.  The city and the atmosphere of the movie are great.  Also the colorization of the film is also something that has never been done before.  Some characters or particular item have color, while the majority of the film is in a black comic book looking color.  The visuals of this film are the most impressive aspect. <br /> <br />My suggestion would be to see this film.  It is one of the most original films that I have seen in a while.  Also, the film may have changed the comic book genre forever.  If you have a weak heart, this may be too violent.  Otherwise, if you enjoy action movies with a good storyline and great visuals, then you should definately check out this movie.
B00009UW0N|5.0|The reason I say Grandpa here is because this is the grandaddy of all slasher films. Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, wake up from your trance and watch the master, Michael Meyers at work. Today sadly, this film has become average, even a little predictable because of its clones. I had a friend who I lent this to who didn't even think this was a good movie at all, not to mention some classic horror. Michael Meyers is the demonic killer who won't die. Pure evil as Donald Pleasance profoundly states. Ah, Pleasance. I'm amazed that this man didn't recieve the Best Actor award for 1978. He is truly amazing here. Don't bother with the later films in the series, such as Parts 3-6. This one is the papa of them all. The camera angles, the stalking scenes, the innovative 'killer's point of view', and last but not least that infamously scary music, that Carpenter composed all by himself one day in his garage. This is a horror classic, always will be, no matter how many wannabes are out there.
B00000JNNY|5.0|Etta James occupies a special place in music history, one that may have been overshadowed by rock and roll or other soul/blues singers who may well have catered to the \\"pop\\" culture of the time.  If you've only heard a bit of \\"At Last\\" on a Fancy Feast catfood commercial, you can appreciate this lady's work.  This is a steal at the price for some great songs!
B00003CXA2|5.0|For everything this film lacks, Tom Hanks more than makes up for with a brilliant performance that only he could pull off. Forrest Gump is a simply Alabama mamma's boy, with a 75 IQ. He befriends Jenny, who he soon sees as the love of his life, becomes a football star, and so on and so frth through history. In fact, it turns out that Gump has been involved in just about everything from American history from 1950-1980. Its a fun movie, with help from a great performance by Sally Field as Gump's mother, and another one from Gary Sinise as the disabled Lt. Dan. There's some great visual effects, and its a fun movie with a little bit for everybody.
1565847032|1.0|Simply read \\"Understanding Power\\" if you have any doubt that Chomsky is fake opposition.  In this book he exhaustively examines the wide variety of corporate, political, and media power centers in America yet somehow never mentions the banking industry.  There is no mention of the most profitable company in the world, Citigroup. This MIT genius has to at least have some idea that \\"money is power\\" and therefore in his book examining all the major power centers it is absolutely impossible that he would not mention the industry that has a monopoly on creating every single dollar in the world. <br /> <br />My guess is that he serves a very useful role to the financial elites by exposing just enough real political and corporate corruption to keep the public satisfied that our media is sufficiently vigilant while keeping us distracted from the core source of power and corruption which is the creation of fiat money. <br />
0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock delivers possibly the best directing job ever on a horror movie[Carpenter's Halloween and Romero's NOTL considered], with the infamous Norman Bates and his mother. <br /> <br /> Its Arizona and Janet Leigh is in trouble, having stolen 40k from her boss, she's at a loss driving down a dark, rainy stretch of lonely highway late one night. But low and behold, the Bates Motel, with the 12 and 12 is available. She arrives at the motel, and nothing but terror ensues. Hitchcock finds all the right nerves and tingles them here, with some infamous murder scenes and that huanting score which captivates you. The last 25 or so minutes of this film work perfectly, and this movie just keeps on getting better from start to finish. There's no reason not to see why this is arguably the most influential movie in history.
B000089CJI|1.0|Hello there: <br /> <br />So I heard this album when it was initially released a couple of years ago and I thought that it was ok. Certainly nothing to write home about. I noticed that a bunch of 15 year old girls really liked it, but then again, their taste was pretty questionable considering that the latest Peaches and Tori Amos records were also in heavy rotation.  <br /> <br />For a much better new release, check out the latest Cam'ron LP, \\"Purple Haze\\"
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Ok so this album is pretty frickin good. Although I've only givin it a few listens it is obviously mind-blowing, at times confusing(Cassandra Geminni) at other times radio-friendly(The Widow) But every \\"song\\" is very good, and the insane drumming and crazy guitar work keeps you on edge... <br />so why 4 stars and not 5? as mentioned in other reviews, the sound effects(yes, they are enough to make em lose a star) As I listend I thought...wow, ok..hmmm, this isn't music anymore and why am I listening to a bunch of weird sounds over n over...for like, 4 or 5 minutes strait. Don't get me wrong, some sound effects are good, but not ones that pointlessly drag on and on and force you to fast forward on your CD player. They can be incorparated into the music and Mars Volta could easily do a good job of that if they realized their music is amazing, they don't need those 5 minute sound effects to create atmosphere and ambience. So all in all, sound effects woulden't have cost them a star..but they just dragged on to long for me and were a flaw rather than a perk to the album. Either way, I'm fast forwarding so I can hear some mind blowing music which is what this album is. Wicked stuff, worth the money, buy it.
B000002INR|4.0|Back in my early high school years (before I discovered alternative music), I was a big fan of hair metal. Some of the music was good but a lot of it was terribly cheesy. One of the few bands around this forgettable era that I thought was far from derivative was Skid Row. While their music was extremely catchy, the band's music was far from glossy and overproduced like Poison and Warrant's music was. Next to GNR's \\"Appetite For Destruction\\", Skid Row's self-titled album was one of my favorite metal albums. Yeah, I bought this cd because of the singles, especially \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" and \\"18 and Life\\" (my two personal favorite Skid Row songs). What I liked about this Skid Row album was that the music was heavy yet melodic at the same time. This was an album even guys could like. What I liked about the band's ballads \\"18 and Life\\" and \\"I Remember You\\" so much is that they were not syrupy like Warrant's \\"Heaven\\" and Poison's \\"Every Rose Has its Thorn\\". I just love cranking up my stereo to \\"Youth Gone Wild\\". That song has to be listened to at top volume. It is a headbanging classic. The non-single tracks on the album are good. I especially dug \\"Pieces of Me\\" and \\"Here I Am\\". The only issue I have to take with the album is that production wise. Today the production sounds pretty dated and could use a remastering treatment. \\"Skid Row\\" may not be high art but it certainly was one of the biggest albums of the late '80s era and one of the few that I still listen to.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|I saw this when it first aired in 1983. 22 years later, I saw it in BestBuy for $10 and had to have it. I honestly don't recall my reactions from the first time, but I do remember that this was quite controversial in its day.     Perhaps today, over a decade since the end of the Cold War, it would be considered bland. But for those of us who grew up in the Cold War and knew the terrible possibilities which were only moments away, this was our reality. Don't forget that this particular time period spawned such Cold War classics like \\"Red Dawn\\". And who could forget \\"Wargames\\"?    The movie is from the vantage of \\"normal\\" people. Only in the background do we get an idea of the rising global tensions. The news comes from radios in the cars, or from televisions which the characters are watching, as they make their way thru their everyday lives.    The first half of the movie builds the major characters, and tries to show you the \\"innocence\\" of the time. These are the people who will ultimately suffer if They press The Button.     We get a glimpse of what would have to be the most horrible thing you'd ever imagine - Minuteman missiles are being launched, from silos which are literally in their backyards.     Once the war is over, the rest of the movie focuses on \\"what next\\". You see the families huddled in their cellars, waiting for a safe time to emerge, but they don't know when that will be. Farmers are trying to figure out how to reclaim their land. Lawlessness ensues as looters and rioters are shot on sight. And as one of the final blows, we see the slow death of radiation disease...    There is never any indication as to who was at fault - who started the war? One scene shows a character getting mad over the lack of this information. But the point is moot, and what's done is done.    Unfortunately, the movie moves slow, simply because of the way the story is told. There is also a disclaimer at the end of the movie which states that the events portrayed are probablynot as bad as the reality would be. Quite the opposite, in my opinion. The events would be worse than any movie could depict. For these two last points, I only gave it three stars.
B000002G6J|5.0|As a consumer, I appreciate Jobim's genius as a creator of wonderful music and great albums. In fact, this is the most romantic instrumental album I know of, great for setting a mood, heck, some of it just plain sounds like languid sex (\\"Dialogo\\"). As a musician, I am simply in awe of Jobim's unique blend of earthiness and sophistication--the melodies, the connection to nature, the \\"primitive\\" rhythms--combined with chords and chord progressions of the highest complexity. The chords to his songs are absolutely jazz to the extreme, and yet it is all grounded by the Brazilian natural world. Jobim was a musical genius, and the main thing he brings to the world of music was....beauty. I had the pleasure of hearing a band play that consisted of Jobim's son and grandson and his cello player from when he played gigs, along with an exquisite female vocalist. They did his songs justice. The music world is a better place because of Jobim.
B0007P3582|1.0|All rap sucks especially 50 cents. Go listen to real music this is a joke.  If I could give negative stars I would.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I don't understand how people can say this is such a great movie.  Maybe I am a traditional vampire fan but when have guns been used to kill them.  I was so upset when I say the first five minutes of the movie and continued to grow even angrier.  This movie should be at dead last.  How dare people put this movie before Bram Stoker's Dracula!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's intrigating and smart and it has such a surprising end. If you like suspense you are going to love it. Just make sure you understood the end, many people I have talk to about this movie have not understood and thats probably why many people didn't like it.
B00005NGZX|1.0|This album sounds like nothing more than a few guys who turned up the over-drive on their amps, and then slowly moved their guitars back and forth from the speaker...all to the \\"beat\\" of a guy who clearly hates his drums and has sadistic feelings for things made of brass, in particular, cymbals. As for the vocals...all I can say is \\"Wow...\\" . If you've ever seen the Simpsons episode where they say Mr. Burns lives next to the \\"Shrieking Shiek\\", and you hear said person's shrieking...you'll have an idea as to how this guy sounds. If not, basically picture any of the banshee-like villains on Scooby-doo, and add ten years of smoking and a complete lack of anything remotely close to musical talent to the banshee-wails...and now you're starting to understand. <br /> <br />Upon first hearing the album, I thought \\"Ahh...I get it, It's a big joke.\\" It seriously made me laugh...possibly more than Mitch Headburg's (r.i.p.) CD, and definately more than American Pie 3. But, it seems they're quite serious. On that note...I don't get it. For an album that sounds like there was heavy short-wave radio interferance with the recording equipment, and a man asleep at the studio-controls...they sure have a whole hell of a lot of fans. It's really hard for me to fathom how anyone was able to put up with these guys in their studio. I guess maybe the attraction is that this is music in it's \\"rawist\\" form. It truely gives the impression that \\"Hey, any jerk can do this\\"...and the need for people to live vicariously through the deeds of others shines brilliantly through the popularity of this \\"work\\". In short, if you're the type of person who longs to hear what a band would sound like if it's members were all locked in a closet since the age of 2, and then finally shown the light of day and handed some instruments...then this is absolutely for you. It's truely \\"art\\". <br /> <br />One positive note of this CD is the deep lyrics. Track 2 really got me going with the thoughtfull \\"Rar rar raraaa raaaaah\\" and I was thuroughly moved by the ending \\"Rah rah rahhhahaha\\" of the closing track. Really deep stuff. <br />-Brian
B0007OCG56|4.0|A whacky, yet amazing story. I really enjoyed Adam Sandler in this film, But still think he should stick to comedy...LOL <br />All in all, it was a great movie, even made me shed a few tears!
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Closer is worth seeing just to watch Clive Owen yell at people. If only he would have punched Jude Law's face in, this movie would have been a classic. I mean, Jude Law is a good actor and what not, but the guy is so cheeky, he just needs a good beating, even if it's a theatrical one.  <br />Another good thing about Closer is seeing Natalie Portman's ass. Who knew? I always thought she'd be totally flat back there, but there's actually something going on. It's no badonkadonk, but it's nice. <br />As for the movie itself, meh. A bunch of beautiful people cheat on each other then get what they deserve. I guess it's a decent commentary on relationships blah blah blah but you never really care what happens to anyone in the movie. Some good angry dialogue though.
B000002LRX|4.0|If one more person tells me Korn are the \\"pioneers of rap-metal\\" I'm afraid some bad things are gonna happen.  Baaaad things. <br />Not only do I consider Korn to be just-plain-bad, but even worse they are the most derivative thing I've heard since Creed (see Pearl-Jam-wannabes), <br /> <br />Faith No More had a very under-the-radar begining with their first couple of albums, and although they weren't bad, it was the arrival of the gleefully disturbed Mike Patton as lead vocalist and lyricist that made The Real Thing such a milestone in 90s alternative rock music. <br /> <br />So they'd hit the big time with a joyously different kinda music that was like Red Hot Chili Peppers meets Sabbath with a touch of Devo. <br /> <br />The follow up?  One of the most beautiful descents into dementia ever recorded.  No \\"Epic\\" here.  The albums most radio-friendly cut, \\"MidLife Crisis\\", is a snarling, spittle-soaked and cynical sneer at just about anything that needs sneered at.  Then you get the speed-ticket-inducing \\"Be Aggressive\\", complete with cheer squad, sinister organs (both church, and B3), and venomously rap-yelled verses about hitting rock bottom and loving it.   <br /> <br />Listening to a lot of the tracks here, it is no surprise to find that Patton was a big fan of Frank Zappa.  Check out the diversity on this sucker!  Everything from psycho-metal to funk to classical is represented.  (Complete with a straight-faced cover of the theme from the film \\"Midnight Cowboy\\".) <br /> <br />The most memorable tracks for me though were three just-plain-evil \\"Caffeine\\", \\"Malpractice\\", and the almost-scary \\"Jizzlobber\\", which still gives me chills. <br /> <br />So, t'hell with Korn and Linkin Park and all these other flakes that try to convey false feelings though melodically-devoid music, all the while actually taking themselves seriously. <br /> <br />Faith No More can laugh at themselves, but after Angel Dust they don't have to.
B000069AUI|4.0|Indeed Coldplay pulled it off following their succesfull debut 'Parachutes' only with some more britpop spice in it. Musically more advanced and more faster than their first, making them the biggest band in England, Europe and prolly in the USA for alternative fans when this one hit the record stores and radio stations.  <br /> <br />
B00004Z459|1.0|I can't believe these boring, redundant, whiny little dweebs actually sell CDs?  Proof positive that the music industry is becoming its own big corporation. <br /> <br />The songs all sound pretty much alike, they're all about hate, pain, self-loathing, and other negative stuff, which would be fine if it wasn't all on such a simplistic level.  There's nothing to relate to here unless your a thirteen year-old skater rat who's pissed at his stepdad for grounding him because of his haircut. <br /> <br />And let's discuss this whole vocal thing.  We've got four choices of vocal styles: <br /> <br />a)  pansy 98 Degrees reject crooning <br />b)  half-assed Axl Rose impression from Karaoke night <br />c)  a disgruntled video-store clerk trying to rap because that's what the girl he works with likes and maybe she'll like him now. <br /> <br />or <br /> <br />d)  None of the above, go buy some real music (Tool, Alice In Chains, Faith No More, or any of the other forgotten greats that are getting shamelessly aped left and right these days). <br /> <br />Hmmm... <br /> <br />In short, I think I'd rather spend five minutes mashing my testes in a car door than listen to Linkin Park ever again.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Now i was never a really big fan of Green Day until a friend gave me this cd for a birthday present. Now i admit i never even opened it until one day on the radio when i heard \\"Bolevard of Broken Dreams\\" It was really good so i decided to play the cd. It was amazing! Ive never heard rock blended like that to make a perfect rock opera. My personal favorites on the cd are: Wake Me Up When September Ends, Holiday, Bolevard of Broken Dreams, and Jesus of Suburbia. <br /> <br /> <br />Top 5 Songs <br /> <br /> <br />1) American Idiot 9/10--Great song. Has that good blend of rock with alot of good beats. <br /> <br />2) Jesus of Suburbia 10-10--An epic! Awesome song <br /> <br />3) Holiday-- 10/10--Also great song. Every political and has a catchy beat. <br /> <br />4) Bolevard of Broken Dreams-- 9/10--First song i heard and it was awesome. Good mix of sorrow with that energetic rock in it. <br /> <br />5) Wake Me Up When September Ends 10+/10--By far the best song on the alubm and best song ive heard in a long time. Every time i hear this song it touches my heart and i love it!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I picked up this CD based on it's ranking here at Amazon for the past few months.  Looking at her picture on the front I didn't expect such a rich and tender voice from such a beautiful woman!  People have said her first CD came out 8 years ago and I'm glad I found out about her now and not then because 8 years would have been a LONG time to wait for such a great musical talen.
0156027321|5.0|This is an extremely interesting work of the writer I did not know before.  A combination of the great concept and an outstanding execution made this book very valuable and well deserving applouds.  I enjoyed it very much and, therefore, with a clear mind, I can recommend it to all of you.
B00004RF9B|5.0|WONDER FILM OF THE CENTURY!  This exclamation was uttered to describe the 1956 interstellar classic, \\"Forbidden Planet\\", by  Forry Ackerman, sci-fi icon and coiner of the term \\"sci-fi\\".  \\"Forbidden Planet\\", loosely based on Shakespeare's play, \\"The  Tempest\\", is sci-fi pulp-art at its cinematic finest: cool spacepeople, robots, spaceships and rayguns; scary telekinetic  monsters, a strange, colorful alien planet, space-trippy electronic music, remnants of a super-advanced civilization, and  a moral message that says if one can't control potentially destructive elements within oneself, one  most likely will not be able to control one's technology either.  \\"Forbidden Planet\\" is a Super Nova in the sci-fi film constellation.  A must see and have for sci-fi fans of all ages.
B00005JNTV|4.0|A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" graphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants.  It takes a visual cue from last year's \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" by green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white \\"Schindler's List\\"). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as \\"Special Guest Director\\" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' \\"Death Becomes Her\\" (which coincidentally also starred Bruce Willis).<br /><br />The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esque Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\", Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall,  a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona)  and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character. The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before \\"Traffic\\". Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch.<br /><br />Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer. All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over itstwo-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow.  But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride.unning time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements.

B00005JNEI|5.0|The facts presented in the movies are hard to ignore. Being a developed nation, USA gov headed by Bush is playing dirty politics with own people. Normally this kind of dirty politics are observed in third world nation. Is America moving backward?  Moore has rightly pointed out why America didn't attack Saudi Arabia when 15 members of Al-quida group belong to that country. WMD was farce and by attcking Iraq, america has created more enemies to counter. Are we really safe? We need to think of it seriously. Who is gaining out of this war? Not common people like us.    -- Adding my comments: 06/24/2005  I am sorry for those guys criticizing this movie. I would advice them to be realistic and try to understand real picture. Try to analyze the situation from your own perspective. Sometimes we don't like to see the dark side but I am telling you it help us to be much smarter in choosing our next step. Moore has done excellent job in exposing the real picture. If you read all the review comments listed here, you will find couple of them from people serving army. You can't ignore them. They are real people and sacrificing their lives for you.  -- Adding on..  Look at the video posted in Google. You will understand real truth. We have voted people to destroy ourselves.
B0000931QA|5.0|while Tommy and The Wall suffer from being too hard to follow, this album is fairly clear and doesn't suffer from any pretensions.  Queensryche have never kicked this much butt, and never did again (though there are good moments on Empire).  The story is basically about a guy named Niki who is disillusioned with politics of the era, and joins a sort of terrorist organization that has him kill people.  He meets a nun named Mary, and falls in love with her, but she is killed.  He goes through a lot of pain, and ends up lonely and confused.  The music gives the story a great amount of power, and keeps interest throughout.  If you are new to the band you should get this and Empire, they are both terrific albums.  You will not be dissappointed, because Queensryche is way better than almost any metal band from the time in terms of intelligent music
0743454529|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is one of the greatest stories I've even had the pleasure of diving myself into.  I found myself struggling to make lunch, go out and meet friends, go to bed on time for work the next day because I was so eager for that next page. <br /> <br />The character development was very well done and the subplots seemed to tie into the main story extremely well and were very creative and interesting.  You fall in love with the characters and feel the pain where they do, you see the outcome and your stomach tightens as theirs tightens when realizing the future and possibilities. <br /> <br />A few of my friends have read the book and some did not approve the ending, while others see the light in it.  I was satisfied after finishing that last page and send my kudos to the author on a job well done.  I spent any free time I had in the last four days on the edge of a couch, bed, bench, coffee shop floor...reading this wonderful addition to my library.  I highly recommend it!   <br />
B000002NFM|4.0|I'm one of the few people in the world who really views a review of five out of five stars to be a work of perfection.  Well, let me break the news to you this way: The Fat of the Land is not perfect.  However, nonperfection means that the record can still be very very good: it is. <br /> <br />I won't bother rehashing the familiar reviews, critiques, and prises of an album nearly eight years old.  I will, however, add my take on a song that VERY few people have mentioned: Narayan.  Narayan is an opus that delivers what I believe to be the perfect touch to one of my favorite albums of all time.  On a CD immersed in dance-heavy beats and power chords, Narayan is a breath of fresh air.  The Prodigy incorporated aspects of musical taste completely unlike anything else on the album while lacing it with a Hindu theme in the chanting.  Yes, it is a Hindu prayer at the end of the song. <br /> <br />I feel as though this song really makes the difference between an above-average CD to one that still makes a frequent visit to my rotation after years of use.  Do yourself a favor and pick up The Fat of the Land.
B0002IU988|5.0|I hoped and prayed to the gods of rock that Stapp would move on down the line.  I recognized and loved Mark's talent back in My Own Prison, and I was just a kid.  Creed had it's run and it was good.  I liked them well enough, but I knew that Stapp would always hold Tremonti back from realizing his true potentiial.  Now that Mark has the reins, he is doing exactly what I knew he was capable of.  Simply in my opinion the best new rock around.  And as for Kennedy, he is a great addition to the crew.  While I did like Stapp's growl, Kennedy is a better all around singer.  And for his ooh and aahs, I like them.  It shows he doesnt take himself too seriously and is willing to be part of the band rather than try to be the main attraction.
B000002B5L|5.0|is the word that sums it all up.  <br /> <br />without a bunch of editorial circumlocution and fan-biased hyperbole i will say this: <br /> <br />go buy this album right now. it's perfect.
B000002AZ8|5.0|The album kicks off with \\"Last Exit\\" and I'm left behind trying to re-analyse what's just hit me. There are tracks , the kind which I wouldn't have expected to hear from this legendary band. \\"Not For You\\" is an outcry for the weak and crumbling lives. With lyrics like \\" All that's sacred comes from youth. If You hate something don't you do it too? \\" it manages to ensure I'm ultra charmed with energy.<br /><br />\\"Tremor Christ\\" is my favourite track off this album. It came as surprise to me. Initially when I heard this track,I would simply keep repeating it. It's easily the darkest song that Pearl Jam has done. I'm reminded of the ocean on a dark night testifying its arrogance with a tide. It brings out the philosophical side in me. You'd think its a very rebellious song. That's true for most of the album.<br /><br />There are many songs in the album that make me re-think my own piece of mind. \\"Nothingman\\" is a soft hearted puncher that holds an authority of its own. \\"Bugs\\" is funny even though it would irritate me to listen to it on red lights with the strong sun steaming down on me. It displays Eddie Vedder's wild chaotic side. \\"Immortality\\" and \\"Better Man\\" are other stand outs from this album. Better Man is a ground breaking Pearl Jam song which sounds awesome when heard live.<br /><br />I can safely say this is an album with a lot of ambition and intrigue involved.At times it has tunes to make it seem like Pearl Jam's best record. What I like about the album cover is its simplicity since simplicity is one thing I disassociate with this band. An enjoyable record which has this crazy atmospheric ambience. I love Pearl Jam and feel strongly about it.I will love them till the day that I die. This might not be there best record. But that's what I say for all the albums.
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|Some of you hate Avenged Sevenfold, some of you love Avenged Sevenfold. I personally dislike them and think that they lick ass. They're album is not good, theres only 2 songs on the entire album i do like (not including the intro) anyway, their album isn't the best i have, i only really give 2 stars to albums that are outstanding e.g Aaron Carter the Party, Papa Roach-Infest etc. I would have preferred the album if it incorporated a bit more country music, so maybe in their next album they'll go a bit country twang! (and not go way over the top like simple plan are heading for :S) my last criticism is that in concert they do Busted jumps...but i guess that can't be helped..... <br /> <br />Ok, where to start.Avenged Sevenfold  are an amazing technical band in a way that appeals to us 74 year olds. Some people may just think that they're tryin to follow in Frank Sinatra's footsteps, but they're not. As it shows in Avenged Sevenfold latest album \\"Waking the Fallen\\" They've changed. their previous albums, where good, and alot of the songs where quite heavy, which is great, but i think they're new album is just as good but in a different way. They've got softer songs on the album. e.g Radiant Eclipse , which is So fortunate because I like my singers soft. Although these songs aren't particuarley heavy, they are still really rude. Promises in my opinion is one of the best songs on the album, and even if you don't like it you've got to appreciate what the songs about.(which is something a 74 year old man like can identify with). I mean Im sick of my parents not giving me enough respect and Im glad for one that avenging sevenfold can give me strength to live on with my life in the face of the oppression regime that my mother forces me to submit to. <br /> I noticed one person that obviously can't spell said that Avenged Sevenfold writes like a 2 year old, this isn't true, just because the lyrics are simple doesn't automatically make the song crap and I agree with them. Lyrics have to be complex in order for a song to be good E.g \\"Chapter Four \\" and \\"Clairvoyant Disease \\" aren't that complex, but they're silly songs and really annoy Mrs Wolrab (my mother).If you're a fan of Avenged Sevenfold, or lookin for a new band to listen to, definately buy Gary Barlow's Open Road. However if your 98 year old mother is really upsetting you, then this is the perfect album for you. When my steak wasnt cooked to medium rare as I like it, I threw a magnificent tantrum. Before my mother had a chance to assault me with her broom I leaped into my room, barricaded the door and played this at full volume.  <br />Result? Medium rare at the next dinner. <br />Thank you avenged sevenfold, for that you earn your one star <br /> <br />
076790592X|5.0|This is a great book that tells a great story and has a great lesson. Well worth reading and owning.
0140277447|3.0|I have Japanese friends and Chinese friends and they are all very nice people until you start talking about the Rape of Nanking. <br /> <br />Basically, the Chinese go ballistic, the Japanese get miserable. The Chinese utterly insist that EVERY Japanese is a \\"war atrocity denier\\" and God help the guy who says otherwise. The Japanese basically regret Nanking as a big mistake, but tend to think they are being ostracized for something they are not responsible for.  <br /> <br />Neither side is entirely right. On one hand, there are plenty of Japanese who are indignant that other Japanese people are trying to forget the Rape of Nanking. In fact, I have met more such Japanese than otherwise. On the other hand, Japanese people were not informed about the Rape of Nanking until well after the war, but they have to be accountable for the government they supported, even if it is about an event that happened long before they were born. (In the same way that our grandchildren will be held accountable for the actions of George W. Bush later on in history when the truth finally comes to light.) <br /> <br />Iris Chiang's book is not the best on the subject. It is just too sensationalistic and indignant. For an even-handed tretise on wartime Japan, I suggest you read \\"The Japanese Wartime Empire, 1931-1945\\" by Peter Duus.
0062515675|2.0|As many books of this kind, the writer thinks that because he made something and he has some advantage of what he did, everybody has to do the same to have a better life. I think that only a very few people would change everything they have to find the spiritual peace. Albeit what is written in the book could be written with some wisdom I don't think that anybody will do exactly as the book says.
B0006399FS|5.0|i got this album around xmas time and i think it is fantastic. some of the songs really are top quality, like 'Sometimes you can't make it on your own', 'vertigo', 'miracle drug' and 'city of blinding lights'. you definitley will not regret buying this album! its trully amazing.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|This movie made me remember every gut wrenching break-up that I have ever had.  It brought to mind the desperate angst that followed the loss of silly, shallow relationships that, in retrospect, can barely be recognized as relationships.  It reminded me that it was so much about the tears, the drama, and pervasive immaturity.       Despite this resonance, I did not like the movie.  The main characters are shallow, painfully self-centered and mean.  No one seemed to grow during the course of the story.  I don't think that the characters had the ability to progress beyond the limits of their self absorption.      If you still want to see this movie, be advised that it probably had a hard time holding on to its \\"R\\" rating because of scenes in a strip club and the detailed discussions about sex that seemed to go on endlessly.  Parents should DEFINITELY view this before they allow their teenaged children to see it.      It also seemed to me that Julia Roberts had a hard time being her character.  It was not a natural fit for her.  She is better when she can flash her gorgeous smile, and there was very little need for smiling in this flick.  Furthermore, it is puzzling how two megastars, Julia and Jude Law, were convinced that this was a good career choice.    Overall, I would characterize this as 4 talking heads agonizing about their sexual entanglements and pseudo relationships. While they are all drawn into the melodrama, none of them seem to be mature or nice enough to even try to enter into a caring relationship.      This movie held my interest, but I would not say that I found it to be entertaining.

B0006GAOCW|5.0|I thought \\"First Daughter\\" was beautifully acted; the wonderful soundtrack also did much to enhance the movie.  I totally fell in love with Katie Holmes and Michael Keaton's characters; both acted their roles so convincingly.  Holmes is adorable and sweet as the First Daughter; Keaton is a mix of the cool and adoring (and funny!) father who's also fiercely protective of his only child.  Their scenes together are very charming - I loved when they shared midnight chocolate cake and when they danced at the Inaugural Ball in one of the last scenes.  Keaton's President character makes you wish that he actually was the President.  The soundtrack is fantastic too and leaves me wondering why it was never released as an audio CD.  I especially loved the songs they played when Sam and her parents were being driven to her school and when Sam, Mia, and the group were frolicking on the water slide.  Also, if you are a fan of Sinatra's \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", there are two dancing scenes set to two different arrangements of the song - magical!  I didn't want this movie to end and kept re-playing my favorite scenes, with the volume turned all the way up of course!

B000008M54|5.0|This album is a whole lot different from THIS IS THE SEA frinstance. I like both of them but the style of this one seems to turn it's back on the angry rock n'roll bit for something more traditional and too often forgotten about.     I picked this up on cassette when it 1st came out and most of my friends said things like \\"this sounds like sumpthin my dad and the boys would make in the basement... ha ha ha\\". Sixteen yrs later a few of us (and a couple bottles of Glenlivet) made some unplugged sounds in my basement that sounded a lot like sumpthin our dad's would've liked. Thing is we all liked it too and so did the wifeys and the brats.    This is a good album, a good influence and a good feelin too!

B00005JNTV|4.0|Sin City (Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, 2005)<br /><br />A lot of people are going to hate Sin City. A lot of people already do, actually, judging by the reactions of the crowd coming out of the theater where I saw it Friday. Yet only three days after its release, it sits (as of this writing) at #112 on IMDB's Top 250, and at least a smattering of critics have praised it. So there are at least a few people getting it.<br /><br />Sin City is old-school film noir. If you're not a big fan of sitting in arthouses watching revivals of old Joseph Cotten films that were just discovered in vaults after being undisturbed for sixty years, you're probably not going to get terribly much out of it. Much of what the critics have criticized in the film, especially the shallowness of the characters, is very much in the style of traditional noir, and as such seemed to me to be strengths, and not weaknesses, of the film. Think of Sin City as an homage to Billy Wilder as much as graphic novel adaptations, and it'll make more sense.<br /><br />All that aside, the one thing the critics have agreed on is the style. And what style it has. Sin City is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in the past decade-- certainly since Begotten, back in 1991. Unlike Begotten, which struck the viewer with its continuing unwillingness to give you a complete picture of what was going on, Sin City revels in clarity. While much of the film's violence is rendered in cut-away drawn shots, as opposed to the live-action carnage one expects from Rodriguez, the sketched-out scenes paradoxically heighten, rather than mask, the brutality. (Don't worry, boys, the nudity is all real, even if it doesn't include Jessica Alba.)<br /><br />From the standpoint of the plot, your best bet is probably to think of Sin City as Pulp Fiction on steroids. Rodriguez juggles the plots in roughly the same way Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction, but without as much parallelism. There's really not much to say about the plots; this is noir. Plot is secondary to style. There are plots, however, rest assured.<br /><br />To try and cover all the actors in this film worth mentioning would take a thousand words in itself. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Nick Stahl head the list for the macho component, and Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, James King, Carla Gugino, Brittany Murphy, and Alexis Bledel get the top billing for the ladies. And I've just scratched the surface. There is a huge amount of starpower in this movie. (When Josh Hartnett and Nicky Katt are that far down in the credits, you know most of the film's budget was spent on the actors, right?) For the most part, the actors do their thing with liveliness, though there are a few stumbling blocks in the road. The biggest of these is Michael Madsen, which came as quite a shock given that only a few months ago I was praising him to the heavens for making Kill Bill vol. II such a pleasurable experience. A number of parts are overacted, but once again, it's expected in noir. Mickey Rourke, especially, chews scenery in a way that hasn't been seen much since Charlton Heston stopped being a rugged male lead.<br /><br />Simply put, you'll either love it or hate it. How did you feel about the original version of The Desperate Hours? If, like me, you thought it was both William Wyler and Humphrey Bogart's best work, you're probably going to get a real kick out of Sin City. If you thought it was boring and overacted, well, you get the idea. Me, I'd sit through it again right now, if I weren't sitting here writing reviews. ****ondary to style.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Mary Poppins has blessed everyone who has ever seen it, and for others who have said they have seen bits and pieces of it...are you living under a rock? Now that there is a double disc 40th anniversary set which is complete with every documentary and enough special features to be a Mary Poppins expert. The \\"Supercalifradgilisticespialidocius: The Making of Mary Poppins\\" is probably a great documentary that is impossible to stop watching, and realizing that yes, this is one of the greatest Walt Disney movies ever made. It is only fitting to thank My Fair Lady for coming in the home stretch beside Mary Poppins, or Julie Andrews wouldn't be as great of an actress or as much as a legend that she is today. Sure, some parts of the movie seems like nothing like a green screen in the back, the pure and simple charming (Dick van Dyke, whose middle name was dubbed charming after this movie), with \\"how they heck did they come up with\\" songs and of course, can we repeat Julie Andrews how many times? Mary Poppins is a classic and every little kid should have this movie, even in this day and age to go back to a time of pure simplicity.
0141301074|3.0|Roald Dahl, The Twits (Puffin, 1980)<br /><br />I have long been a huge fan of Roald Dahl's work, both the kids' books and the adult stuff. Some few pieces of his oeuvre have escaped me over the years, and so I figure it's time to track them down.<br /><br />The Twits is an amusing little tale of a husband-and-wife team who are ugly, mean, and stupid (perhaps presaging the parents in Matilda?). They train monkeys and eat bird pie for supper once a week. The monkeys and birds get fed up, and decide to give the Twits a taste of their own medicine.<br /><br />It's amusing, for what it is, but it doesn't seem to have quite as much heart in it as do Dahl's great efforts. The Twits themselves don't really have the depth to make them the memorable characters one normally finds in Dahl's best books (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Danny the Champion of the World, etc.), and the plot of the thing feels more as if it's been stuck on with Hugtight Sticky Glue than it does an integral part of the story.<br /><br />Fun, but if you want to become a true Dahl fanatic, start somewhere else. I'd suggest Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was what made me a lifelong devotee when i first read it as a six- or seven-year-old. ***
B0007CNXUK|4.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is a tale of imagination, and how it can help shield us from the difficult times that real life can hang on us.  For the Llewen-Davies boys, times have been very tough, with the death of their father, and the pitiful financial state that has left the family in.  Times are tough, indeed, and they are about to get tougher, with the degenerating health of their mother, beautifully played by Kate Winslet.   <br />But the Davies boys are about to get some relief from their hard-knock lives in the form of J.M. Barrie, a playwright who is having hard times of his own.  Johnny Depp plays Barrie as a champion of youthfull spirit, but also with the realism of an adult fully aware of the problems he has been ignoring for some time.  Barrie's marriage is on the rocks.  He and his wife (Radha Mitchell) do not share the same bed, nor do they share much about their own lives with one another.  There are a few key moments that expose that these two people were in love once, though that has long since passed, and the loss of that love is in some way a tragedy.  A scene where they say their final goodbye at the premier of \\"Peter Pan\\" is touching and tragic, and the audience finally gets the view of the marriage that could have been if... <br />Barrie spends all of his time with the Davies boys and their mother (though in a platonic relationship) and teaches them to pretend.  IN the meantime, they give him the inspiration he needs for his masterwork.  He never uses the boys for inspiration, though.  His relationship with them is one of love (fatherly love, as is his relationship with their mother.  When he communicates to Sylvia (Winslet) about love it is both vague, and far too late for any romantic attachment.  Reality once again sets in, and Barrie must teach the boys and their mother that they must not pretend all of the time.  They must deal with what is at hand, but with the powers of their collective imagination, their family can last a lifetime.   <br />Thefinal scene involves Barrie and Peter talking on a bench.  Peter is one of the middle children in the Davies family, and is played with such maturity and emotion by Freddie Highmore that you wonder how much depth someone that young could really have.  \\"Finding Neverland\\" is about just that, finding the place you can escape reality and deal with it all at once.  It is a beatiful film that may be a little sweet, and it certainly skirts the issues surrounding Barrie's relationship with both the boys and their mother.  Barrie is depicted as near saintly here, but the result is something wonderful nonetheless.  A very entertaining family picture.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I'm going to be blunt with you: <br />I don't think \\"American Idiot\\" is Green Day's best record. But I think it is their best album. Confused? <br />All right, let me explain. I waited four patient years for this record being one of the six fans of their previous record, the drastically underrated \\"Warning\\" and purchased this record the day it came out and immediatly put it in the C.D. player housed in my car. Once it finished I immediatly started it again. Now this is a great record, a rock record for the ages I thought to myself. <br />But I didn't love it as much as I did \\"dookie\\" back in '95 when I was thirteen or \\"Warning\\" back in the double zero. I can, and strongly do, believe that this is a great album and the best one that Green Day has ever recorded, even if I don't believe it tops said records. <br />So what do you get from \\"American Idiot\\"? Well as most people probably know this record is a rock opera in the Who sense, a record that tells a story over an hour, and like ost rock operas at times I have problems following the storyline, which seems to be about a kid living in a hyper political time who runs away from his suburban home into the city. But the story isn't important if the music isn't good, and Green Day make sure that this won't be up for argument. <br />\\"American Idiot\\" pretty much sounds like \\"Warning\\" with better production. The songs continue to stray from the power pop/ punk styling of their earlier records to bring in soundscapes that are reminscent of the Who and, most notably, the Kinks. Listening to this record its easy (and FUN!!!) to play spot the influence, whether it be the Kinks, the Who(most on the excellent song \\"Are We The Waiting\\") or the Ramones and the Pistols(the title songs is one of the best punk songs Green Day has written thus far) to more interesting influence (whoa, that sounds like Mott the Hoople!!! Holy crap, that sounds like \\"Ziigy\\"!). <br />It's to Green Day's credit that never once do they sound like a cover band or that they're ripping off said artists. Green Day are, and have always been, a smarter band then people give them credit for. When you recognize a song or a sound its a passing interest since Green Day do not rip off as adapt these sounds into their sound adding more dimensions and flavours to it overall. Case in point is the two nine minutes song \\"suites\\" that appear at the beginning and end of the record: where when most bands do this and sound pretensious, Green Day sound energized, as if they're extending a middle finger to everyone who said they sold out back in the day and to everyone who thought they were has beens. <br />The only real problem I have with this record is the same one that I have with every rap opera, and that's that at times to arc of the record seems more important then the musicianship on the record, where \\"Give Me Novicaine\\" and \\"She's A Rebel\\" are both kind of bland and \\"St. Jimmy\\" is a song that Green Day have performed much better in the past. But by the time Tre Cool sings the Dolls-esque(that's the New York Dolls for you kiddies) \\"Rock 'n' Roll Girlfriend\\", I could care less if there are a few less than stellar songs. <br />I think \\"American Idiot\\" will probably go down as one of the best records of the last twenty years and it deserves it. It is a great record. It's the last one of a dying breed(to iPod this record is a crime since it needs and should be heard in its full context) and show that Green Day are only getting better with age, even if I still think \\"Warning\\" (which if you dig this record and haven't picked up, you should really do so) and \\"dookie\\" are better records.
1593072937|5.0|I hate to admit it but I was never a huge Frank Miller fan.  I enjoyed his work quite a bit, especiall the \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" but I was never ready to confer God status on him like many.  That said, Sin City is one of the most unique worlds ever created in comics.  Starkly real and intimidating and yet over-the-top in nearly every facet,  It's a winning combination to be sure.  Miller's use of shading and his art style are perfectly suited to this film noir type of material.  You can almost see the shadow of a slow moving fan in the background.<br /><br />The Hard Goodbye Introduces us to Basin City AKA Sin City and Marv, a lug of a guy whose just met the girl of his dreams....but not for long.  He awakes to find her dead and himself as the suspect.  Marv finds himself now battling dirty cops and whomever else dares get in his way in a true symphony of violence.  As gritty, dirty and evocative a comic story as you will ever read.  The Hard Goodbye makes \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" look like a Sesame Street story by comparison.  Wow!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I wrote reviews for the seperate Alien DVDs describing the new footage.  Now, here is my review for all the Alien films.    ALIEN: This film is one of the greatest sci-fi films since 2001: A Space Odyssey and horror films since the Exorcist and the orginial Psycho. And this is Ridley Scott's best film to date (Gladiator was excellent too, don't get me wrong) this film started a legacy that will continue for centuries to come. The story is about seven space miners who find a mysterious planet (which is later named LV-426) and later go off to investigate. Then, one of the crewmembers (Kane) goes down a tunnel and ends up with a facehugger on his face. Little do they know that this facehugger has planted an Alien embryo inside of Kane. Then, after the chestburster erupts from Kane's chest, the merciless Alien kills five other crew members (well actually four, one was an android protecting the Alien so the crewmembers killed the android) and changed the life of the seventh forever. This outstanding, groundbreaking film made millons at the box office and earned itself an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. The new DVD has two versions of the film: The orginial theatrical version, and a new \\"Director's Cut\\". Personally, like all other people, I don't mind this new Director's Cut. Ridley Scott reedited this version with exceptional skill, and the 4 1/2 minutes of new footage is easy to spot, but the 5 minutes of footage he edited out from the theatrical version is tough to spot. Still, the Theatrical Version is slightly better. It is 47 seconds longer than the Director's Cut.    Theatrical Version Rating: 9/10  Director's Cut Rating: 9/10    ALIENS: James Cameron's Alien vision is super intense, suspenceful, and matches everything ALIEN matched in the sci-fi genre. 57 years have passed since the destruction of the Nostromo, and Ripley now joins Colonial Marines to destroy the Alien species for good. This film earned 7 Oscar Nomnations inculding Best Actress (Sigourney Weaver),an incredible feat for a sci-fi film.  This film is the film in which Sigourney Weaver gave her best performance by far in any of her films she starred in. This DVD is the DVD debut for the theatrical version of this film, and it also contains the Special Edition, with 17 minutes of extra footage, making the film flawless in all ways.  The Special Edition of ALIENS is the best posible version of the film- because it has more action, suspense, story, and most importantly- character development. But that doesn't mean the theatrical version isn't worth watching. The theatrical version is outstanding- the special edition is classic. A must for sci-fi buffs.    Theatrical Version Rating: 9/10  Special Edition Rating: 10/10    ALIEN 3: The third film the the ALIEN QUADRILOGY is far worse than the last two- but still good. This film does not have the one-two punch of ALIEN and ALIENS, but has good performances by most of the characters, but a definite feeling of deja-vu hangs over the proceedings. The mediocre FX, the fact that director David Fincher shamelessly ignored the orginial Alien design (well at least they said it was different- but never gave a reason why in the film) and a nearly endless chase down a seemingly endless amount of tunnels. Still, a few scares are in this film, and other good things too. This film is the goriest, most violent, and most profane ALIEN film. The DVD of this film has two versions of the film: the theatrical version and the never before seen special edition (formerly known as the Assembly Cut or Workprint Version) this version adds 40 minutes of deleted, extended and alternate scenes to the film, extending its orginial run time from 114 minutes to 144 minutes. The Special Edition is better than the theatrical version because it makes more sense than the theatrical. If you watch both versions, and compae them, you'll see why. ALIEN 3 takes place in a prison facility that Ripley, Hicks, Newt and the destroyed android Bishop land in after two Alien eggs were laid, once attached itself to Ripley's face, and the other (to a dog in the theatrical version, and an ox in the special edition). This prison facility is a maximum security prison full of male inmates, a company man, a medical officer, and the warden. Ripley survives, and Newt and Hicks get killed. Then, the Alien bursts from an animal's chest and runs amok.    Theatrical Version Rating: 6/10  Special Edition Rating: 7/10    ALIEN RESURRECTION: The fourth and final ALIEN film is the worst of the four, but it's not that bad, since the monster effects are superb, but the film itself, has far too many plot holes, wisecracks and a script written by Joss Whedon- the worst script writer ever. The acting is OK- and the story stinks. Overall- it's OK- but is still the worst of the four ALIEN films. This film was directed by Jean-Pierre Jenuet- and he has little skill in the sci-fi genre. This DVD has two versions: The theatrical version and the improved uncut special edition, with 12 minutes (I think) inculding an alternate opening and ending and extensions of other scenes, making the films orginial running time 109 minutes to 116 minutes. This version is a little better, and I like the orginial opening much more than the theatrical opening. Jean-Pierre Jeunet only cared about the film critic's reviews from France, not the United States.     Theatrical Version Rating: 5/10  Special Edition Rating: 6/10    Overall Rating for all 8 Versions of all 4 films: 7.5/10    Extras: There are SO MANY extras in this set, i will just put it this way: each film gets it's own three-hour documentary. On the movie discs, you will get commentaries for all four films for both versions of each film. Ridley Scott, Sigourney Weaver and others provide the commentary for ALIEN. (Unfortunately, this was the only ALIEN film Weaver did a commentary for.) for ALIENS, James Cameron and others do a commentary. For ALIEN 3, David Fincher didn't participate in doing the commentary (I don't blame him). Editor Terry Rawlings (he was also was the editor for ALIEN) and others inculding Lance Henriksen do a commentary for ALIEN 3. For ALIEN RESURRECTION, Jean-Pierre Jenuet and others do a commentary.     Extras Rating: 12/10    Overall Rating For Entire Set: 10/10    Anyone who's anybody has to get this extradinary set. YOU WILL LOVE IT.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Ok, so I'm not the greatest Metallica fan out there - the only album (cd) I had before watching this dvd was Metallica (or what they call The Black Album). I was very curiuous when this dvd came out and efter a while I decided to rent it. Wow, was I surprised! Superb documentary. I absolutely loved the therapy sessions. This showed the guys in Metallica in a whole different light. I enjoyed watching James Hetfield with his kid. No matter how tough they look on stage, I think they are real soft at heart. I admire that. But I must agree with one other reviewer, that Lars Ulrich is quite immature. Hey, Lars, it's time to separate the men from the boys!<br /><br />One thing that had me a bit unsettled was the visit to the prison. I do understand that having James talking (and them making their video) there made a \\"cool\\" impression on the prisoners, and I liked what James said (\\"we are all born good\\"), but by looking at what happens afterwards - them walking off the stage and hugging each other - says to me that it must have been quite difficult to be there.<br /><br />I was very impressed with it all though. Wow, if you haven't seen this, you have to!! Someone compared this one with This is Spinal Tap. I can see a bit of resemblance in it. I became even more of a fan after watching this movie. They rock!

B000002IAZ|5.0|The group recorded three albums during their three years together, but one  (Stampede) was never officially released. A fourth album (Last time around) was assembled from leftover tracks after the group disbanded. Their second original album (Again) is easily the best of the three officially released and several of its tracks are included here. Within a general acoustic rock style, there is plenty of diversity including folk, pop and country influences and this eclectic mix illustrates the clash of styles within the group.<br /><br />Stephen Stills and Neil Young provided most of the group's song although they never wrote together. Of Stephen's songs, the highlights include For what it's worth (their only major hit - it made the American top ten), Bluebird (about Judy Collins), Rock and roll woman (about Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane) and Go and say goodbye. Of Neil's songs, my favorites are Mr Soul, Broken arrow and Expecting to fly. The other songs are all great including one by Richie Furay, Kind woman.<br /><br />Neil Young and Stephen Stills went on to form Crosby Stills Nash and Young with ex-Byrd David Crosby and ex-Hollies Graham Nash. Richie Furay and Jim Messina went on to form Poco, an important country-rock group that survived many line-up changes of its own.<br /><br />Ultimately, Buffalo Springfield are more famous as the launching pad for the careers of its members than for the music they made together, but their best music, included in this set, is certainly worth a listen.
B00005JNTV|5.0|Marv could not describe this film any better.  Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have officially indocrinated 21st Century Film Noir with \\"Sin City.\\"  Color blind, brutal, and simply brilliant.  The biggest, nastiest, and most faithful comic-book film brought to stark, gritty life might also happen to be one of this year's best films.    The most soulful story goes to \\"The Hard Goodbye\\", with Mickey Rourke giving a career-defining performance as Marv.  One magical night with a goddess that ends in death sends him on a relentless quest for revenge on a nimble cannibal (Elijah Wood) and his puppet master (Rutger Hauer).  Every answer, every clue comes to Marv the hard way, and he behaves accordingly.  But even though an angel will run him down with her car three times and pistol-whip him into a near concussion, he still doesn't hurt girls.  The best noirs feature evil protagonists not afraid to die; but Marv will kill, die, AND go to Hell for Goldie on his warpath.  Amen.    In \\"Sin City\\" men are animals, and women the fodder for them.  Benicio del Toro's malevolent turn as bad-cop Jackie Boy owns the story of Dwight (Clive Owen) and his rekindled romance with a merciless whore, when a truce between them and the cops gets violently broken.  The only way to keep the secret (Jackie Boy's severed head) is to invoke massacre upon Irish terrorists in love with explosives and a cyclops kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) who wish to expose the betrayal to the whole city.  But The Girls of Old Town can't let that happen.    \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" is the bookending story: introducing the film and closing it.  An aging detective (Bruce Willis) with angina rescues a potential rape victim, gets double-crossed by his partner, then framed for the crime.  The culprit is the son of a Senator (Powers Boothe) with an unholy fondness for little girls put under duress.  As the framed cop sits in prison for years, the slimy sex-maniac gets treated with experimental regeneration medicine to replace the right hand, left ear, and package that was so violently taken from him.  The result is a pear-shaped, remorphed yellow monster hellbent on exacting revenge.  An inside-out physical likeness of the kid's twisted soul.  Jessica Alba (as Nancy Callahan) is delicious but not intense enough to respectfully enunciate the horror I myself had tasted upon first reading that scene in the comic.  Obviously, Bruce Willis takes the reigns in this tale.    I've heard people say the film is too gratuitous, and I'm prone not to argue.  It is.  But the only reason it is, is because the graphic novels are, too.  \\"Sin City\\" is basically a madmen's cinematic experiment gone horribly right.  It's flat-out mean, sadistic, and misogynist -- just like all the best film noirs.  If you asked this film to apologize for being what it was, it would respond with a bullet.  However, it is beautifully realized.  Who knew that a premier artist and a superior technician could create a \\"City\\" that... breathes its own denizens.      You can taste this film between your teeth.
B000031WI8|5.0|Wham were, possibly, Britain's most commercially successful pop group of the eighties. The duo began recording funky dance manic but their biggest successes came when their music mellowed.<br /><br />Wham's funky period yielded the UK top ten hits Young guns go for it, Wham rap, Bad boys and Club Tropicana. Their last really funky song, Wake me up before you go go, gave them their first UK number one. After that, most of their hits were ballads beginning with Careless whisper, which was credited as a George Michael solo although Andrew Ridgeley co-wrote the song. It made the top spot in the UK and was followed to the top spot by Freedom, credited to Wham.<br /><br />Next came the double-sided UK hit combining Last Christmas with Everything she wants. Only a charity record (Do they know it's Christmas, on which George joined other celebrities as Band Aid) prevented this single being yet another UK number one for Wham, but Last Christmas remains my favorite Wham song. It is a superb love song although it has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas except that George chose to use Christmas as the date in which to set the song. It returned to the UK top ten a year later.<br /><br />Three more UK number one hits followed - I'm your man, A different corner (credited as a George solo) and the double-sided coupling of Edge of heaven with Where did your heart go?<br /><br />Although nominally a duo, Andrew Ridgeley was very much the junior partner and it came as no surprise when the duo split up and George pursued a solo career. Some of that music is not very different in style from the ballads that he recorded with Wham.<br /><br />This compilation contains all the important tracks recorded while George and Andrew were together as Wham, including those credited as George solos.
0761536434|5.0|this book was good. it was a good book. Ultimately, if you want to know the history of videogames this is good, book.  kent takes interviews from actual dudes who worked on these systems and has their words all in the book.

B00005JNTV|4.0|Sin City isn't a perfect film; in fact it isn't even close.  It's hard to say inclusively that it's bad or good, because there are a lot of different aspects to the flick.<br /><br />As far as translation from book to screen, the movie is near flawless.  Rodriguez and Miller have managed to recreate Miller's heavily stylized comics on the big screen without losing an iota of the heavy black or stark white.  They also manage to keep the dialogue and internal monologue intact which are both a merit and a major problem with the film.  Most people who've read Miller's Sin City work don't make the connection to Mickey Spillane and Sam Spade, to Humphrey Bogart and the lingo of the Hard Boiled detective pulp novels.  So when they hear the dialogue in the movie delivered in such a manner it'll probably come off as comic or exaggerated.  People today just don't remember or care for the older genres that so many of today's writers and directors fell in love with as children.  People expect an update not a faithful homage.  Yet they complain when they feel a book to film translation isn't faithful.  Simply put, people don't know what they want.<br /><br />That being said, I think the film also suffers a little in it's editing.  Being so faithful to its graphic novel roots, I feel that Rodriguez failed to treat the three novels as individual stories.  The three chapters blur into one another in a slightly uncomfortable manner with only a change in narrator to tip the viewer that we are switching gears.  I think the film would benefit from titled chapters, ala Kill Bill, which would be in keeping with the source material.<br /><br />The film is also heavily CG'd, but I think that helps to define baSin city as it's own world just outside of our reality.  It also makes it easier to swallow the use of bright highlights of color and the exaggerated cartoon violence.<br /><br />I also feel the film was superbly cast with Mickey Rourke as a standout and Elijah Wood as a surprisingly creepy Kevin.<br /><br />All in all I think a lot of people are going to have a problem with aspects of the film that are actually quite faithful to Miller's graphic novels.  The \\"corny\\" dialogue, over the top unrealistic violence and action, the slightly cartoonish or simple characterization, all of these are in the Sin City books, and I think a lot of fans forgive this in the comics but won't in the film.  To me this points to unrealistic expectations of the adaptation to the silver screen, or more commonly, be careful for what you wish for, you might just get it.isingly creepy Kevin. <br /> <br />All in all I think a lot of people are going to have a problem with aspects of the film that are actually quite faithful to Miller's graphic novels.

B00005JNTV|1.0|I just saw this movie.  It's intended to be over-the-top, but it goes so far over that it becomes a self-parody.  The writing is cheesy and cliched, and the actors can't help but overact to match.      It's also interesting that the only jobs available to women in this movie's world are scantily clad waitresses, strippers, naked lesbian parole officers, and whores.  I'm all for T&A, but this was ludicrous.      If you want to see excellent film noir that's sexy, violent, and amoral, check out Romeo Is Bleeding.  Only see Sin City if you want to laugh yourself sick.
B000068IEU|4.0|I think this film has at its essence the true spirit of the horror film. To me this film is not entertaining, and it is one of only a handful of films that truly disturbed me, one that follows through on it's intent to horrify. Most modern horror films tend to glamorize violence and gore, and tend to herald killers as anti-heroes to a point where the audience is no longer horrified or scared. What I found interesting is where this film sits on the timeline of horror, right after Night of the Living Dead, and right before Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween. It surprises me because it exhibits characteristics that are out of place for the time. The level of gore and outright brutality are much higher than in the films that immediately surround it, and the fact that it predates Texas Chainsaw Massacre by two years astounds me. For me three of the most important aspects of the film are: its \\"fairy tale\\" plot, it's documentary feel, and it's early use of the \\"Rules of Horror\\". I believe this is one of the first films that uses punishment as a repercussion of immoral behavior, i.e. \\"If you are going to go into a strange apartment in hopes of buying drugs, you will be (insert punishment here). I also believe that this is one of the most exploitative films that came out of the 70's. It's not a comfortable film and it isn't entertaining, it's purely disturbing and horrific.
B000069KE0|4.0|CHICAGO II undoubtedly contains some of the best work the band has ever done. That it is only their second recorded set makes it even more astounding.  The Rhino remaster is thus very welcome. <br /> <br />Like the debut effort before it (CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY), CHICAGO II could benefit from some editing (is there a double set that couldn't?), but, on the whole, it's more unified, and features some of their most famous tunes--this is where you'll find \\"Make Me Smile,\\" \\"Colour My World,\\" \\"25 or 6 to 4,\\" and \\"Wake Up, Sunshine.\\" <br /> <br />Strangely, however--though the performances are top-notch--the production is spotty. James William Guercio's modern, clean sound is featured on the first five tunes (the rousing \\"Movin' In,\\" the punchy \\"The Road,\\" the thoughtful \\"Poem for the People,\\" the rambling \\"In the Country,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Wake Up, Sunshine\\"), but for some reason, Jimmy Pankow's famous \\"Make Me Smile\\" is muddy and muted, making it--and the next eight songs or so--sound AM-Radio dated. <br /> <br />However, things perk up with Robert Lamm's classic \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" (about a tired songwriter), which features Terry Kath's best recorded guitar solo. <br /> <br />Much of what follows is expendable (the \\"It Better End Soon\\" series has some interesting things in it, but overall, it's a waste), although Pete Cetera weighs in with his first written tune--a pleasing little ditty called \\"Where Do We Go From Here?\\" (supposedly written after he'd gotten his face smashed in during a fight at a baseball game). <br /> <br />In spite of the flaws, the remastered CD is worth purchasing; though the 'extras' are somewhat lame (singles edits), it features a young, enthusiastic band at the height of its power. <br />
B0006SSOHC|3.0|Audiences are jaded, especially horror fans, so it's extremely hard in this day and age to make a truly disturbing film on either the visual or plot levels without coming across as trying to hard. This film skates the edge of \\"trying to hard\\", and in my opinion falls on the side of genuine. What I like is that this film is stepping in the right direction, away from teen horror flicks and the \\"I'm a ghost and didn't know it\\" flicks that seem to dominate the genre. One of this films strengths is that most of it plays out in a minimal environment, much like Reservoir Dogs, which places the focus of the suspense and horror on the character's actions, and helps keep the jump scares to a minimum. Like in Se7en, what is disturbing in this film is the choices the characters make and why, not just the environment they are in like in the Dawn of the Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes. I also think that most of the devices and situations are believable if not original. What I don't like is the reliance on the \\"who dun it/surprise ending\\" which I feel is five years past overdone and boring. The film could have cut the last three minutes of revelation and been much stronger and might have earned the accolades it's been airing in it's TV and radio ads about the killer being placed next to many of the horror icons of the past thirty years. At the end of the day this film feels a lot like Se7en, but then that's not such a bad thing.
B000069KGM|4.0|Seven talented guys in their twenties, a smart producer, and a stack of great tunes: the first Chicago album is arguably still the best, even after all these years.  The Rhino remaster is thus very much welcome. <br /> <br />CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY showcases the band at its chunkiest, highlighting the elements that would make it great: Robert Lamm's songwriting, Jimmy Pankow's ripping brass arrangements, and (especially) Terry Kath's innovative guitar.  Chicago should probably make it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on the strength of this set alone. <br /> <br />As is the case with most double-sets, there's enough good stuff here for one great album; expendable are long-winded indulgences such as \\"Liberation,\\" \\"Someday,\\" and \\"Free-Form Guitar\\" (sure it's interesting, but does anybody actually sit through it a second time?). <br /> <br />But everything else is perfect, from the rousing \\"Introduction,\\" to the catchy \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\".  \\"Beginnings\\" is perhaps the best song Lamm ever wrote, and Kath rips through solid rockers like \\"Listen\\" and \\"Poem 58\\" with astounding style--nobody picks like him. The bluesy \\"South California Purples\\" is the perfect blend of early Chicago strengths, and the cover of Steve Winwood's \\"I'm A Man\\" is excellent...I dare say that Chicago's version is better than Traffic's. <br /> <br />Another plus is James William Guercio's thoroughly modern production. Aside from \\"Questions 67 & 68,\\" it's impossible to guess that he also produced BS&T (a great but dated band). Here, Guercio has the drums slam, the arrangements tight, Kath's love for the wah-peddle reigned in, and the voices of Pete Cetera, Kath, and Lamm sounding gorgeous. And let's not forget the horns: they race, dart, power up, and slash through what has to be one of the most impressive recorded debuts in rock history. <br /> <br />While the Rhino remaster contains no bonus tracks, the liner notes and the CD reproduction of the original packaging are sure to please fans.
B00005JLKN|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. In my opinion Brett Ratner and Ted Tally did a second rate job of bringing the story from print to screen. Everything in this movie is muffin top, with no actual muffin. The duo did a wonderful job of including practically every scene from book to film, but along the way lost everything that made these scenes make sense. Nothing is explained, no motivations are explored, and characters are so thin that they are barely recognizable beyond the basic Killer, FBI agent, scummy reporter icons. This is a common danger of transferring a book to screen (too much info, not enough time to convey it); there is an art to it, and this time Ratner and Tally are merely drawing stick figures. To compound the problem, both have chosen to beef up Hannibal Lector's on screen time, which not only does not mirror the book, it takes away from the suspense of the actual plot. The best example I can give is that Ratner and Tally have chosen to include lengthy scenes including Reba, a blind woman, touching a tiger as it's under anesthesia, going so far as to include her cupping the tiger's genitals, yet they give no reason for why the characters are in this situation in the first place. In the movie it comes off as merely aesthetic and pointless to the plot (in the book it is very important to the plot). Most everything in the movie comes off this way. Another example is the motivation behind the main killer, who suffers from a cleft palate, which is not pointed to in the movie, though the character in the movie has the scar, e.g. all muffin top, no muffin.
B00013F38K|5.0|Hard to imagine someone giving this ONE star because they cropped the screen in favor of a more modern widescreen \\"look\\". What about the quality and direction of the entire season? What about the fact that there is NO OTHER WAY to have this series on DVD expect like this? Yeah, what about it?  <br /> <br />The transfer here is retina searing. It is hard to believe this was filmed 30+ years ago, looks more like yesterday's dailies. The sound is rather disappointing in light of the extreme care that went in to the video transfer; it is still lagging back in the 70's even though we all have 5.1 sound systems and the fact that if a series as old as the original Star Trek can be upgraded to 5.1dd, what about this? I should mention that the packaging is well constructed and... is beautiful. <br /> <br />I think the most valuable aspect of this series is what all great series have/had; the ability to cast GREAT guest stars EVERY week. We all know Carradine is great, just as we know Peter Falk as Columbo is great, what sets this show and shows like Columbo apart from typical and forgettable 70's TV drek is the entire SHOW is good not just the leads. That to me is crucial, and Kung Fu excels in spades. The only small niggle I have is the fact that the child that played Caine in the flashbacks really looks NOTHING like him and they should have strived for at least someone who looked moderately HALF Chinese, hell I would settled for a quarter. <br /> <br />I found this show by checking it out through \\"Netflix\\" as I LOVE old TV but was only 4 when this hit the TV screen. Not wanting to BUY it only to feel as though it wasn't that great I highly recommend that venue. Having \\"rented\\" DISC ONE SEASON ONE I knew I had struck gold, this and Starsky and Hutch are my two new finds for 2005, does anyone watch NEW TV any more? With a Sea of Raymonds and a plethera of overblown new Medical shows it's nice to know I can experience TV back when characters mattered.
B00006FDCD|1.0|Ok the movie is great... I know this I mean growing up in this era you'd have to be pretty nonexistent if you don't know about \\"It\\" anyways... I didn't buy this DVD for a couple reasons... one, the special features... there really aren't any what's with that? this movie I would believe should have tons of extra features... and the second what's with Dolby Digital 2.0... isn't that just stereo... come on we could get that on VHS... give us a reason to buy this and I'll pick it right away... but get on the ball... at least make it worth it.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|Carla Bruni's album has the beautiful sensualism that comes through use of the French language.  Her guitar and voice send chills through the simplicity and universality for people of any background, regardless of knowledge of the French language.  Although I am not 100% fluent yet, Bruni's album inspires me to develop my skills.  Favorite tune right now is Le Toi De Moi.  I am out to the record store today to pick up a copy, hopefully with the lyrics on insert (sorry Amazon - but I cannot wait for you to mail me a copy!!).  Even if she wasn't gorgeous, I would say her music would lead you to that conclusion.  To listen to Bruni is to feel sexy and beautiful, she shares herself.
B0000027FQ|3.0|When I bought Staying a Life, I was expecting a 2 CD set, since this CD was released in Europe and Japan as a 2 CD set.<br /><br />All and all I'am very impressed with the U.S. version but I think it should be rereleased as a double live CD.<br /><br />(not refering to The Final Chapter 2-CD)<br /><br />I saw Accept live in Chicago at the Oak Theater in October of<br /><br />1993 and they put on one heck of a live show.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|Whichever reviewer said Gwyneth Paltrow mailed in her worst acting on this one, had it nailed.  I actually MADE myself watch to the point where Angelina Jolie came in, HOPING she would add some flavor to this bland movie.  No good.  I ended up turning it off and calling it a day before the thing even ended.<br /><br />On the positive side, I could only stomach ONE bad movie that weekend, so decided not to go see Constantine, just in case.  Whew!  Thanks Sky Captain for saving me from that one!!
B00028HBKC|1.0|To start this movie is totally wrong.  Unlike others may believe this movie did not follow the way it was supposed to.  Not to mention we were never supposed to know the physical burden Christ went through.  It is just Inhumane.  and on top of that Aramaic is not the language they spoke.  It was Greek.  That is exactly the original language of the Bible.  Read any introduction to any Bible and IT WILL say that.  I made the mistake of watching this travesty.  For those of you who haven't don't.  It will break your heart.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I'm a casual Yes fan but I have watched this DVD many times since getting it.  It's better than I thought it would be and the die hard Yesfans out there certainly should get it.
B00025ETIW|5.0|First of all, I'm almost 18 years old and mostly into Hardcore/thrash/heavy and death metal. So if any arrogant person is going to judge my taste in music, BACK OFF! <br />I did grow up listening and experimenting to all kinds of music and to be honest, most so called 'emo' bands are bunch of melodramatic trendie posers. Guys and girls, My Chemical Romance is a band that's truly making original and real music rarely produced by bands forming like mushrooms these days. <br /> <br />I consider My Chemical Romance to be more like a screamo, yet melodic band with beautiful emotional screaming vocals and instrumentals. I don't wana go much into scrutinising their genre as it only seems to cause conflicts. It's the music that important. If you like it, buy it, listen to it! If you don't like this kind of music, go and review what you do listen to. <br /> <br />After getting this album back in November 2004, I had to keep listening to it over and over again. This is one of those albums you can't bored of. There is not a single track (except 'Interlude') that you can really skip. The best songs without doubt are Helena, You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison, I'm Not Okay (I promise), To The End, and Cemetery Drive.  <br /> <br />Helena is an 'awesome' opening track. The lyrics are meaningful and vocals are so melodious and has a gothic influence. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison sounds like a classic is my personal favourite and sounds like a classic emo which many would agree derive from the punk genre (no, not the anti-flag punk. urgh). I'm Not Okay (I Promise) is an awesome screamo song with rythms and slight punk lyrical influence. To The End is another great song in the album similarly to 'You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison' and has a classic emo influence. Cemetary Drive is a truly emotional song and the lyrics give me chills. In total, the whole album is packed with  lyrically and vociferously emotional, melodic, original and meaningful songs. <br /> <br />If you like 'music', this CD is a MUST BUY.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|IF: <br />You've ever lost a close family member; been plagued by the absence of your creative muse or at times totally consumed by it; or you still can recall what it was like to be an imaginative child, then I believe you will enjoy Finding Neverland.   <br /> <br />This is a quiet movie.  It begins slowly and you need to let it envelop you in the Edwardian time period and pace. It has moments of humor, joy and pathos, but I never found it to be manipulative in its moments of sadness.  Instead I felt genuine emotion and connected strongly with the movie and its characters. Even though I usually avoid movies that make me cry in public, I saw this one three times at the cinema. <br /> <br />The casting of actors for this movie was excellent!  There was not a single weak link in the lot. Especially good were Depp, Winslet, and Highmore. As well the actress who played Peter Pan was wonderful. Depp is one of the rare actors of our time that can say so much just through the expression in his eyes and face.  He also does a soft Scottish accent very well. As usual with his performances, within seconds I forget that it Depp on the screen and see only the character he portrays.  I also found Dustin Hoffman to be very droll in his minor role adding just the right touch to his part. Be sure to watch for two of the actors from POTC in minor roles in this movie.   <br /> <br />The outtakes of the DVD were quite funny, especially the one involving Peter Pan, and the one with Depp and the dog.  It would have been nice to have some of the actors involved in the feature commentary. The only major criticism I have of the DVD is the fact that it starts off with a commercial for a vehicle which you cannot seem to bypass and which is so out of character with the period movie you are about to watch.  <br /> <br />Finding Neverland is a worthy addition to my collection of movies.  I feel sorry for those who have not the ability to enjoy this kind of movie or who cannot relate to the themes of dealing with loss, dealing with growing up and the importance of maintaining one's imagination.  They are surely in need of discovering their own Neverland, and I hope someday they do. <br />
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Simple, basic, and LOUD.  This album, put simply, works as a great, turn it up loud piece of 70s music.  DLR can sing, and ICE CREAM MAN proves that in spades, as does the rest of the album.  The key to what this is about is simple and loud. I recall a pre-Christmas Music  mag at the time as saying that All VAN HALEN wanted for Christmas was the loudest PA  in the world. I think they did get  it, but they are probably not as loud as some current bands. But the testament to this disc is that it still sells over 25 years later.  People like it now, and they liked it then. Simply put, you either get it, or you don't. Gene Simmons picked this band because , I suspect, maybe he saw a little bit of KISS in VAN HALEN. The difference is that whilst almost anyone can play the essence of the songs ( as Gene Said that any Garage band can play KISS songs, but no-one else can do their  shows), the key Difference is that the backing band to the singer is probably one of the best Three-somes ever set up... a Major-League  combo that unlike some other bands who had similar skill-sets, could not keep egos and other Issues under control. VAN HALEN were precedent  setters, but they were not Stayers, or even survivors, but sure as hell their albums were, at least the early ones.    This album, if not the general approach of VAN HALEN worked because of a formula that was pretty well known to those who read the music  rags  of the time. Simple tune, simple rhythm, and basic main solo. This disc was innovative, and hit its demographic in the same way that KISS hit theirs. The group that KISS hit in an absolutely  phenomenal way probably grew into VAN HALEN when they thought that the music of KISS was passe, and they wanted more then just a fabulous show. VAN HALEN provided a great show, and quite deliberately played so very loud that you could not think... they stated this in the interviews. Especially  so in an interview they gave one year when they said \\"All we want for Christmas is theloudest PA  in the World\\". Do you really think that a band \\"discovered\\" by the Gene Jeanie would have a non-Corporate plan ?  Well, despite this, the album is a killer, it works, and it works at volume ( turn it to 11 :-). And Rock the Night Away !!!!!!!!    Some  covers have really silly, and sometimes interesting stories associated with them. Not this one: The band was short on jewellry during the photo shoot, so they used bandaids .    ENJOY
B0006IF92U|5.0|Delta's debut sold more than 1 000 000 copies in Australia alone - I personally think it was rather average - I gave it a low 4 stars on my previous review. It's lyrics were sometimes rather childish and immature, and commonly corny.<br /><br />Contrarily, on her follow-up, her lyrics are rather poetic, and actually are about something, hence the lyrics: \\"I know July the 8th [the day she was diagnosed with cancer] will be never the same\\" -- Extraordinary Day, and \\"Out of the blue, there I met you [Mark P]), and other lines, including a lot of metaphors, and 3rd person talking (hense: \\"Loves an electric storm\\", and \\"She's [I'm] always the analyst!\\"<br /><br /> It has so-far sold 350 000 copies and Australia and 100 000 in the UK (note: Innocent Eyes sold 600 000 copies in the UK; 2.3 million copies worldwide).<br /><br />I strongly recommend this CD for everyone. I, personally think the lead single 'Out of The Blue', is the worst song on this album, it is far simplistic, and is no progress from her previous work, and 'Almost Here' is just a simple pop-ballad that Delta didn't even write.<br /><br />The standouts are the second (third in the UK) single 'Mistaken Identity', which is poetic, and original -- it sounds Tori Amos influenced, 'THE ANALYST' is another of my two favourites. The background vocalists are outstanding, and even though at the intro it starts of a bit slow, it turns out outstanding. Another standout is 'ELECTRIC STORM' it is very smooth and fast-paced, and would do a platinum single! Miscommunication and Fragile are also very good.<br /><br />The only dull tracks are the first, last and 'Be Strong' -- which all are far too simplistic and acoustic.<br /><br />To conclude, this album showcases a great range of songs, from the simplistic 'Out of The Blue', to the poetic 'Mistaken Identity, and to the complex original genius (a bit of an overstatement, but anyway.....), 'ELECTRICAL STORM' I very strongly recommend that anyone should purchase this release.

B0000YEEGM|5.0|Dustin Hoffman as Raymond, an idiot savant who has been living in an institution, and Tom Cruise as his long lost brother Charlie. When Hoffman inherits all their father's money, Cruise feels slighted and kidnaps Hoffman for ransom and drives across country with him. Most of the movie takes place on this trip west, with Hoffman stealing all the scenes using idiosyncracies of the idiot savant - the quirks, habits, routines, and great memory. (Hoffman wins them big bucks in Las Vegas as a card counter.)<br /><br />Hoffman, who has played everything from a bum in MIDNIGHT COWBOY to a woman in TOOTSIE to Lennie Bruce, has another \\"role of a lifetime\\" to bite into. He does a magnificent job, too. It's wonderful to see him work, and Cruise, who grows to love Raymond (though he loses him back to the institution again), is excellent too as a self-centered hustler. Definitely worth a watch.
630542828X|5.0|This is a movie starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall, Tony Shalhoub, William H. Macy if that is not enough reason to see this movie then I don't know what is. A must see.
B0000584V3|5.0|First off, I'm not a death metal fan. I find stuff like Cannibal Corpse unlistenable, and wouldn't touch one of their albums with a ten foot pole. So naturally, I was very hesistant when a friend of mine reccomended Opeth to me. I decided it couldn't hurt to download the album and give it a chance. After all, this friend had very good taste in music, and I trusted him with this. I was very surprised by what I heard. \\"The Leper Affinity\\" features the kind of crushing guitar riffs and \\"cookie monster\\" style vocals that I was expecting, but unlike with most death metal, they actaully sounded good. Buried under these raging riffs was a great melody, and evidence of great songwriting and composing. By about three minutes into the song, I could tell I was going to enjoy this. But then the song got even better, as the time signature changes started coming into play, and it showed some complexity. Around the 5 minute mark, the cookie monster vocals stopped and were replaced by a crystal clear, starightforward vocal style. It hardly sounded like the same band. By the time the high-powered \\"Leper Affinity\\" was over, I couldn't wait to hear the rest of it. And sure enough, it didn't let me down a bit. \\"Bleak\\" is a relatively simple song, with a melody catchy enough to be enjoyable, but loud enough to get you fired up. When the vocals shift to normal style overtop of the electric riff, it really shows just how amazing a band Opeth is. After two amazing songs in a row, \\"Harvest\\" falls a little short, but is still a good song. It gives a glimpse of what would come on 2003's Damnation, as it is all acoustic guitar and clear vocals, making for a very beautiful piece. \\"The Drapery Falls\\" returns to the brilliant style of the first two songs, opening with a short acoustic intro before more of Opeth's soaring guitar riffs kick in. The melody here is great once again, and the structure makes the song an incredible ride, constantly shifting from quiet acoustic bits to explosive rock outs. \\"Dirge For November\\" opens as another simple acoustic piece, before the ususal wall of electric guitars comes from nowhere. This is the most sinister sounding song on the album, and one that fans of the usual type of death metal will appreciate. That said, the intensity it reaches is incredible, and it certainly ranks among the finest songs in Opeth's repetoire. \\"The Funeral Portait\\" has one of the most high energy riffs on the album, and the guitar solo shows that these guys have a pretty good idea of how to play their instruments. That said, it's also the least addictive track on here, and the weakest (though on an album of this strength that means very little) \\"Patters In The Ivy\\" is a brief but beautiful acoustic guitar and piano instrumental, serving as more of an interlude than anything. \\"Blackwater Park\\" closes the album out the same way it started. Crushing riffs, screamy vocals and a weird but cool song structure. This song is a true epic, and will be appreciated by anyone who likes loud music.  <br /> <br />As a whole, this is the only time \\"cookie monster\\" style vocals have not bothered me. Opeth takes the attitude of death metal, but gives it a rythm and melody, as well as great lyrics. If some death metal bands would only learn from them, the genre could maybe become tolerable. In fact, several months after first discovering and loving this album, it has not only held up over time, but I've grown to love it even more. I can honestly say this record deserves 5 stars, and any music listeners should hear it. Liking metal isn't important, they are so easy to appreciate that it shouldn't matter. One of the best albums of all time.
B00005JMX6|5.0|The ultimate teenage boy fantasy film. Elisha-Cuthbert is mesmerizing in it. The kid in me loved this movie.
B000002JNJ|4.0|Some people don't know this, but this was Pantera's fifth album, I believe. Their previous four were in the glam-metal genre and are a 99% waste of time. The band doesn't even admit to them having been made. \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" marks a half-way point between the glam-metal and the thrash/alterna-metal of their later albums. This is still very heavy, but Phil Anselmo actually sings much of the time (he has an excellent voice). \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" is basically the band's constitution, and while it is a great song, it also states pretty much everything the band was about. \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\" is excellent thrash, but too short. \\"Heresy\\" is somewhat of a mixed bag. It attempts to condemn Religious fanatics, but they come off as sounding kind of dumb (as evidenced by lines such as \\"lick my sack\\"). Still there is a breath-taking guitar solo in the middle with many different layers. It sounds like something Tom Scholz of Boston would do if he played metal. \\"Cemetary Gates\\" is the ballad as well as the best song on the album. A sad song about some guy who lost his wife or girlfriend, this is very emotional and doesn't come off as lame. The chorus seems weird at first (How does Dimebag [or Diamond, as he was known at the time] get those squeals?), but as you get used to it it becomes much better. Excellent singing as well as a spectacular guitar solo, make this arguably Pantera's best ever, although \\"Hollow\\" gives it a run for its money. There are some good heavy metal songs after this, but as the album goes on, they sound more and more similar. Some may not mind this, but for me it was why it didn't get a five. Still, this is essential for all heavy metal fans to own.
B00005JNTV|4.0|With apologies to Rob Reiner for paraphrasing the immortal SPINAL TAP line about \\"Smell the glove\\" album cover which could not get any blacker lol. <br />This movie is neo-classic noir, not simply for its bold shooting in black and white against green screens. Frank Miller the comic genuis that attracted me to Daredevil back in the late eighties, then went on to renew my interest in Batman authored a series of graphic novels in the early nineties called SIN CITY. I have not read the graphic novels but remember skimming them back when they originally came out. <br /> <br />Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller then adapted said comics into a live action motion picture, with a small cameo directing appearance from Quinten Tarantino. Is the end product as dark as it could be, it surely is pitch black with characters like Bruce Willis's aging detective, Brittany Murphy's waitress and Jessica Alba's kidnap victim turned stripper to name a few lost souls populating Sin City. <br /> <br />The actors including Benecio (can't currently spell last name sorry) turn out excellent performances, but it is Mickey Roarke's Marv and Clive Owen's Dwight that steal the show. <br /> <br />Miller's dialogue is crisp and edgy with dark humour counterbalancing the sheer splashes of blood red colour onscreen. <br /> <br />Like Pulp Fiction the narrative of the movie is split into three vignettes, which led some reviewers I believe to critique the repetiveness. I forgive this however with the knowledge that the movie is maybe the closest adaptation of a comic ever lifting shot for shot and almost word for word from the source. Therefore if one views movie as three interconnected stories as opposed to one long one the repetitiveness may not be such a factor. <br /> <br />This movie appeals to the comic collecting young crowd, but also to a crowd of older moviegoers that like innovative directing, searing action, ambigous morals and plenty of action in their movies.
B000002N2N|2.0|Although the track list is nearly identical to the NYC 1978 CD by King Biscuit, I had to crank up the bass ALL THE WAY to get an adequate sound out of this CD.  It is easier to hear Joey's vocals and lyrics on this one, but overall, better sound and energy from NYC 1978.  Ramones RAW is a, \\"must have,\\" BTW.  : ) <br /> <br />
B00005JKHP|5.0|Like the last review, I was also excited to find out that a trek movie was being made. I was 9 years old and had seen many reruns of the series. The movie was disappointing to me at that time because I didn't understand it, and wanted to see lasers and dog fights with ships and stuff. When trek II came out, which does have dog-fighting in it, I ased my old man to take me to it, but he didn't. Probably cuz II had no naked bald chic. lol. Anyway I see that trekI was sort of like 2001:a space odyssey.
B00000DCHI|5.0|I was just noticing the tracklisting Amazon put out.  I could've sworn \\"She's Always A Woman\\" was on this Greatest Hits Package. <br /> <br />Am I correct? <br /> <br />
B000053GTK|5.0|I just ordered my CD so I can't tell you anything about this remastered version.  But I can tell you that this is a superb album, and that this band had a level of invention and musicality that absolutely amazed listeners back in an era when invention was not uncommon.  I DID hear Gentle Giant live, and were even better than their basically perfect studio records.  I have bought every Gentle Giant CD I have found and I had no clue why this one wasn't out there, since it is among the best albums they have made.  I'm SO glad to see it reissued, this one is a real treat.
B000068FXX|4.0|If you have the stomach to stand the super-ultra-sugary (and sometimes annoying) vocals of this group, you will enjoy this album. The band is immensely gifted and talented British rock musicians, but this album is all about melody in the right places, not \\"rock\\". It's a superb collection of seven songs, finishing with the majestic ten minutes FOOL'S OVERTURE.<br /><br />I think this album is slightly inferior to CRIME OF THE CENTURY, but anyway is a very good album, from a time when there were REAL bands out there, not the marketed talentless acts that appears nowadays...
0931838401|5.0|This is the best all in one camera identification and price guide, bar none.  It has been expanded each new edition and this one is no exception.  It has many new photos and a ton of improved ones as well.  Well worth the money if you have a collection to sell or you want to start one.  It will pay for itself for sure.
B000002NAK|2.0|There is no argument that the soundtrack that this album is from is a well crafted and artistic film but unfortunately the songs have been so overproduced since the original 1976 much rawer concept album that it loses much of the \\"edge\\" and message. <br /> <br />I hope it wasn't star ego that led to Madonna (playing Evita) singing \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\".  The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece. <br /> <br />Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio.
B00005R2M3|3.0|I love Shakira,but her music sounds much better in spanish.This CD wasn't doing much for her voice and the songs aren't that great either,especially Eyes like yours(Ojos Asi).This song sounds much,much better in spanish.I would recommend you buy one of her spanish albums than this CD.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This is a surprisingly good movie, but it's very, very depressing. If you're looking for funny, lovable Ashton, this is not your movie. Ashton Kutcher turned in an unexpectedly good performance but this part is quite a change from anything we've ever seen him in.  I can't emphasize enough that there are sensitive topics like child molestation and suicidal ideations. The premise is really interesting, and there's a lot going on - you have to pay attention. No happy endings here.
B000002E5J|5.0|This CD is great.Every song on here is well written, as well sung. I love every song,especially:Pies Descalzos,Suenos Blancos,Te Espero Sentada,and Vuelve.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Christian Bale is at his absolute best in this movie. The premise of a post-apocalyptic society is not new, but it's done very well here. It has the feel of 1984, the action of any good martial arts film, but gorgeous cinematography that puts it in another category altogether. Put this one at the top of your list. You don't want to miss it.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|As a Neil Young fan, I was surprised to see that Neil had relesaed a \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD.  Neil is not a \\"Greatest Hits\\"-type of artist.  I was even more surprised to see two CSNY tracks on this disc.  I would have thought that those were slated for an evetual CSNY compilation.  Finally, while this does include material from Neil's solo career, Crazy Horse albums, and CSNY, where is the Buffalo Springfield?  Neil's \\"Mr. Soul\\" and \\"I Am A Child\\" deserve to be here too.  I guess that's what you get when you rely on \\"downloads, airplay, and sales\\" to determine your greatest hits. <br /> <br />Still this is a good introduction for new Neil fans.
6305313687|5.0|I have to say, there is a lot of negativity towards this movie.  In fact, I think some of it is unfounded.  I saw on Amazon that someone said it didn't examine racism.  Where we watching the same movie?  The issue was fully addressed and picked apart, mainly by Edward Norton.  How so you ask?  Well, in one of the flashbacks, Derek offers some interesting (and very logical depending on your perspective *Please note if you did agree with his arguement, that does not make you racist) points to why things are the way they are.  Because of that logic, it lands Derek in jail.  Naturally, he is afraid he will be killed in jail for his views.  He does find others like him.  But this is where the magic happenes.  Derek discovers that the people that say the things he says, do not believe in the same thing.  Derek's anger cleary defined when he finds one of his own dealing with a hispanic man in jail.  Under the logic of Derek, this is not allowed.  However, they accept it as business.  Now Derek has changed and realizes what he has been believing all along is fake, phony, and hollow.   <br /> <br />My point is this, the movie examines both sides of the issue, with a great deal of irony.  Although Derek sees the issues as black/white (note that the flashbacks are very symbolic of this), but when he gets out, things are very grey.  American History X is a brilliant film that should not be overlooked.  It even applies to modern day America, and offers reasons for why we hate, and what we can do to change it.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|There haven't been a lot of good, scary movies recently except I thought this one was very scary and intriguing.  I liked the plotline even though the actors could use a few more classes.  The concept of this film was incredible - it's a different kind of murder movie - it's psychologically and physiologically thrilling - I would recommend it!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Clever and insightful, \\"Closer\\" is a romance for adults. It is serious fare. There is nothing cute or cloying about it. If you are searching for happy endings, search elsewhere.  <br /> <br />When I say that this is a romance for adults, I mean that you have to be at least 25-years old to appreciate this story of ill-fated, star-crossed and double-crossed lovers. It's far too complicated for the teenage crowd. <br /> <br />In London Dan [Jude Law] meets Alice [Natalie Portman] literally by accident. A year or so later, Dan meets Anna [Julia Roberts]. He is attracted to her, but when the relationship doesn't work out, he spitefully arranges a meeting between her and Larry [Clive Owen]. Larry and Anna click. The story then gets complicated. <br /> <br />The four stars give awesome performances. Except for two walk on roles, they are the only actors in the movie. Natalie Portman makes excellent use of a role that should propel her career enormously.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended for adults.   <br />
B0000047D5|3.0|While this is a good album from my favorite OP trio - with Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen - there is less than 40 minutes of music, and there really are no memorable tunes.  It certainly does not compare favorably with Night Train, Jazz Soul/Affinity, Peterson Plays Basie, and several other Oscar Peterson Trio CD's.  I would buy this, but not until adding some of the others to an Oscar Peterson collection.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This is absolutely the best Goth movie ever made. Everything in it  - the acting, the sets, the costumes - is as good as it gets. Kate Beckinsale kicks ass, and Scott Speedman is just glorious. Best film since The Crow, light years ahead of Van Helsing (ugh).<br /><br />I don't know how I'm going to be able to wait until December for the sequel.
B000023VR6|5.0|I have never been into rap, or the idea behind it, but this album is something extraordinary. Dr. Dre has the best rap beats I've ever heard in my life, and upon listening to this album, I now have much larger appreciation for rap. The rhymes and lyrics are strong, but the most impressive and astounding part of this album has to be the flow of each song, the production work, and each and every beat. Dre finds all the best rappers to have a part in his song. Only one track on the album is only Dre, that track being The Watcher.<br /><br />The most impressive achievements on this album have to be Still Dre, Forgot About Dre, What's The Difference, and Xplosive. Each of these tracks displays the true essence of what rap is really all about. Each of those tracks features unbelievable lyrical deliveries and impressive rhymes, outstanding, catchy beats, and a great pace to the song. Dre is quite possibly the most influential rap artist of all time, and it definitely shows on this album. There are a few ridiculous songs, just silly and pointless, but those songs are still very much worth listening to. Then there are the furious lyrics of Education, and the slow paced but absolutely essential track, B-tch Niggaz. Two of the best songs also would have to be the laid back, soothing beat of Let's get high, and the low key bouncing of Next Episode.<br /><br />Honestly, I couldn't see how a fan of rap wouldn't love this album. It has it all. It got me interested in rap and I'm now a huge fan of Dre. Therefore, I highly recommend this album to all fans of rap, or someone interested in rap like me.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This is possibly one of the best live Rock concert DVDs I have ever seen.  <br /> <br />Dream Theater...Live at Budokan in Tokyo Japan on April 26, 2004.  <br /> <br />This is a band that never ceases to amaze me. I got into DT around 2002, right after they released 6DOIT. I thought that was an amazing album not only because of the concept behind it, but the songs were amazing, too. It was unlike anything that was being played on MTV (sic) at the time. Train of Thought is more of them exploring their Metallic side, to me. DT has their own brand of heaviness. Their melodic songs are great, too. After hearing Disappear on 6DOIT, I felt...well, shocked. You know, in a very good way.  <br /> <br />Anyway, back to this DVD. I have not been to a DT concert yet, but from what I hear, this DVD comes as close as you can possibly get. Their live show is intense and very visual. It looks a lot like a movie, at points. If you watch the videoscreens behind Mike Portnoy at times, you will see visual representations of the lyrics James LaBrie is singing. It#s most shocking during the last song of their set, In The Name Of God. (Keep your eye on the center screen during the eerie melodic break.) The bonus features on the second disc are pretty cool, too. Guitarist John Petrucci explains in detail his guitars, setup, why he wears his guitar so high, and how he stays awake during the performance. Also Keyboardist Jordan Rudess explains his keyboard setup. Ana a VERY interesting setup it is.  <br /> <br />Buy this DVD. You'll be glad you did.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNTV|5.0|With any luck Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" will inspire a new genre of filmmaking - a literal union between filmmaking and the world of comic books/graphic novels.  I know, I know, there have been countless films inspired by the world of comic books which have attempted to recreate the chills and thrills.  Not one of them - even the best (e,g,, Spiderman series, Tales from the Crypt, etc.) has been remotely as successful as the creative team that gives us this brilliant, jarring, vision.   <br /> <br />Rodriguez, Miller and company obviously put themselves (and the cast) through painstaking paces to assure every frame, every emotion emoted by an astonishing array of live talent is instilled with the gritty, graphic hyperrealism of the world of Frank Miller.  It is a breathtaking achievement which, alas, will go unnoticed and be underappreciated by many who don't \\"get\\" this world.   <br /> <br />The cast is nothing short of remarkable:  Mickey Rourke gives his finest performance since Barfly - maybe ever.  Bruce Willis has never given a better performance than the retiring cop, Hartigan.  Everyone involved is obviously relishing having the time of their lives.  Outside of Shakespeare I can't imagine anything currently more theatrically over-the-top and satisfying than being associated with Sin City. <br /> <br />For many the violence will be of too gory and graphic in nature (gorygraphic?).  Others will enjoy the rough ride but also be appreciative of the often stunning beauty of so many of this film's images.   The final tale in the trilogy of stories that make up the movie is shot with the cool and chill of winter bathed in a snow storm of such exquisite beauty that I don't find it difficult to say it is among the most beautiful images I've seen in any film.  Ever. <br />
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Who says this is their \\"mature\\" album? I detect no estrogen in the air whatsoever who listening to Lullabies to Paralyze.  From track #2 on, Lullabies brings nothing but pure, unbridled intensity to the table.  Even upon the first listen (which is truly rare for me), I knew this was a keeper.  Burn the Witch with Billy Gibbons going off on guitar was the pinnacle of the CD for me.  Josh Homme has a unique vision for this band - one that works.  After kicking out bassist Nick Oliveri and Dave Grohl done with his moonlighting gig as drummer of the minute, Josh Homme amazingly still managed to put together one of the most intense and provocative records of the year.<br /><br />If in doubt, just put on the epic \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" and bear witness to what makes this album one that you won't be coming out of your CD player for some time to come.  BTW, you gotta love the grisly wolf pics in the artwork.  Almost worth getting the CD alone for.
B00004U8H4|5.0|First, it's gory. Really, really gory. It's also brilliantly funny and sarcastic. It skewers the whole 80's culture of greed and ego. Christian Bale deserves some kind of award for his performance - very few actors could have pulled this off. If you can handle the violence, see the movie for the social commentary as well as Bale himself. If you're old enough to have voted against Reagan, you'll love it.
0385486804|5.0|Wow.  This book is intense.  If you work with teens or you are a teen, read this book now.  Krakauer explains the logic (& lack thereof) of the adventurer and his plans.  It taught me about camping, hiking, nature, wilderness, and my own life as well.  This would be a great book club book for teachers and parents of teens as well.  You'll need at least one person to talk with about the book for sure.  Don't read this before you fall asleep, but definitely read it!
0553565915|3.0|I've given this book three stars because it is not badly written and it's sheer popularity probably makes it a \\"must read\\" for those who are interested in the topic of near-death-experiences. But I do have a few problems with the content, which I'll share as briefly as possible.<br /><br />First, please know that I am not a scoffer. I believe in life-after-death and I'm open to the possibility that near-death-experiences can occur.<br /><br />But Eadie's story, on all too many points, seems terribly contrived. For example, she fails to mention that she is, or at least was, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) at the time that this book was written. I believe it is no coincidence that the most interesting doctrines found in her book: pre-mortal existence, the universal nature of the laws of God, eternal intelligence and more, are drawn from the teachings of the LDS church. Yet no where in the book does she mention the remarkable resemblance between what \\"the Light\\" told her and what the LDS church teaches. Wouldn't her readers like to know about this connection?<br /><br />Eadie also mingles a liberal amount of New Age philosophy into her visions, so much so, that her books are listed in the New Age category in most book stores, which probably explains why Eadie seems apologetic when she appeals directly to scripture to back up her visions, \\"I quote from the Bible from time to time, because, although some people dismiss it, in my opinion it contains most of the answer we desperately seek from God.\\" (Quoted from Eadie's book: \\"The Ripple Effect: Our Harvest\\") Unfortunately, many New Age doctrines conflict, not only with the teachings of the LDS faith, but also with broader Christian beliefs -- mixing the two philosophies together makes for a rather muddy mess of contradictions which weakens her overall story.<br /><br />Equally problematic is the fact that Eadie continues to peddle stories of her near-death-experience on the open market -- bringing out book sequels, prayer manuals, audio cassettes and more in several different languages. And she conveniently let's her readers know that there is a bottomless well of more experiences to share in the future, \\"Much of what I learned on the other side was removed from memory when I returned to earth. God let me keep what knowledge I needed, and he restores a little more as time goes by.\\"  (\\"The Ripple Effect: Our Harvest\\")<br /><br />The science-fiction writer, Orson Scott Card, predicted this marketing blitz back in 1994, \\"It is an oft-told tale, and it would be remarkable indeed if it had not grown in the retelling. And it will continue to grow -- in this book Eadie talks of portions of her experience that have been hidden from her memory. No doubt as the demand for sequels grows, she will find that the Lord has allowed her to remember these \\"forgotten\\" sights.\\" (Quoted from: [...])<br /><br />It's a shame that Card's predictions came true., prayer manuals, audio cassettes and more in several different languages.

B00006LLNV|5.0|This is truly a wonderful masterpiece of contemporary Mexican music! As a lover of the Spanish language and culture, i find it refreshing that there are so many wonderful CD's that reflect the robust spirit and life of Spanish speaking people through their music, and that the Frida Soundtrack is one of those, and probably one of the best that accentuates the many sides to the culture, the people, and the music. And what's a huge bonus is that this CD has the translation of the songs! I thought that i would have to get my Spanish dictionary and translate myself...but of course that would have been unnecessary. Even if you don't understand the lyrics to the songs (or just too lazy to read the translations of it), you can still get something so much out of it. Beautiful soundtrack for an exceptionally done film and tribute to Frida herself.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out. First of all, it only cost me $7, and second it is positively amazing. Talking technique, these guys seriously are ahead of the pack of many of today's bands. The songs are very energetic, lengthy, and... uh... well, they're good as well. Being a drummer, I am once again floored by Jon Theodore's talent. He is, to me, perhaps the most underrated new drummer of our time. He needs to be recognized, so buy this album.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan is not a success when she is presented to the local Matchmaker (a terrifying woman) as a prospective bride, and the meeting ends in chaos.  Feeling that she will never be a credit to her family, Mulan gets her chance when an envoy arrives from the Emperor, China is being attacked by the Huns, and one man from every family must go to serve in the army.  Mulan doesn't want her frail father to have to go, so she steals his sword and armour and gallops off on her horse Khan in his place.The spirits of her ancestors send a somewhat undersized dragon (the voice of Eddie Murphy)to guard her. She bluffs her way into the army, struggles through the training process, and eventually succeeds in becoming a real soldier, winning the respect of her comrades and doing her bit to save the Empire. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful film, with gorgeous animation, a thrilling plot,lots of humour, great characters and a superb score.  Mulan herself is an attractive and heartwarming heroine who keeps your interest and sympathy throughout.You feel like cheering when she manages to climb to the top of the pole and throw down the arrow, and there is a breathtakingly exciting scene where the Huns come sweeping down the snow-covered hill and she defeats them with a brilliant piece of strategy  The supporting characters are good too, Mulan's parents (unusually for a Disney film, she has a father as well as a mother)are very sympathetically portrayed, and she also has a feisty grandmother who has one of the best lines in the film, when she sets eyes on gorgeous Captain Shang and says \\"Sign me up for the next war!\\"  Eddie Murphy is very funny as Mushu, and Mulan's army colleagues are amusing too. Everything about this film is an absolute delight.  <br /> <br />
B00068IOWC|5.0|If you liked any of their previous albums, HTDAAB is a bit of everything, much like the band itself. I'll be honest, when Vertigo came out, i deemed it as a \\"stadium\\" song, but it was enough to get your appetite wet for the rest of the album.  <br />     Miracle Drug is one of their best ever. Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own will bring you to tears if you listen to it at the right time in your life. Love and Peace is a great ballad, they'll probably be playing it with Sunday Bloody Sunday or Please on the tour. City Of Blinding Lights has an opening that is better than \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" (i know you joshua tree fans will get mad at me for that last comment). One Step Closer is the type of song you'll want to listen to to cool down, and gather your own life together. \\"Origin of the Species\\" is very good, but i think it's overrated compared to the other songs on the album. \\"A Man And Woman\\" is probably the worst song, but for a U2 album this means you will still enjoy it and listen to it close to a million times. \\"Crumbs from the Table\\" is the song you will listen to and think is stupid, and about 5 minutes later have to hear over and over again! PS the DVD version is better than the album version. Yahweh, was the first song i ever heard of the album, and one of their best closers ever.  <br />     The album is made by a band that knows music better than any other band out there. If you like U2, you have no excuse on why not to get this. If you don't like U2, this is your first excuse on why to love them.
0393324818|4.0|Moneyball refers to the growing practice in the MLB, spearheaded by Billy Beane and the Oakland A's front office, to exploit market inefficiences which undervalue over-performing players by paying them less than what they're otherwise worth until the market catches up, at which point, those players will be traded and new undervalued players acquired.  It is a fascinating subject, partly because it is unbelievable that no baseball insider before the late '90s blew the whistle on the ineffective and expensive manner in which baseball was (is) recruiting players.    Secondarily, the book focuses on the rise of Bill James and other amateur statisticians and the use of their work by Moneyball GMs like Beane.  I thought the book was a page turner because these subjects were so interesting.  However, the author rolled out his best attempts to make these subjects boring and dense with his overly verbose writing style.  Is he writing for meatheads because he hits the reader over the head with a baseball bat (no pun intended) over-explaining every obvious concept.  Likewise, even though the reader can predict where the plot is turning, he has to tell you before it turns, just in case you might miss it.  Furthermore, the book is disorganized and several grammatical errors led me to believe his editor was out to lunch.      The writer's most notable offense, however, is his repeat babbling explanations of concepts that he had explained ad nauseum in prior pages.  At points, I wanted to scream, I GET IT ALREADY!  Simply put, it's been a long time since I've read a book where the author does his best to bore you.    One substantive flaw in the book occurs towards the end, when the author essentially concludes that it is the continued thick-headedness of non-moneyball General Managers which allow Moneyball GMs like Beane, Paul DePodesta and Theo Epstein to continue to exploit the market inefficiencies.  But the logical corollary to this theory is that if the other GMs \\"smarten up\\"and operate in a moneyball fashion, will the lower-budget teams like the A's stop winning as bigger-budget teams more effectively compete for the (previously)undervalued players?  It's clear that the author disagrees with Bud Selig's conclusions about the ability of low-budget teams to compete fairly with high-budget teams.  But the writer doesn't explain whether Selig will \\"become\\" right if big budget teams begin playing moneyball and valuing players in the same fashion as Beane and his cohorts do.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I own many albums. Around 400 just on CD. This is one I'm proud to say is timeless. I can not say anything about this album that hasn't been said before. It changes just about anyones life who listens to it. It has perfect range and songwriting. This is Tom at his peak. Well I suppose all the 80's albums were his peak. Swordfishtrombones and Franks Wild Years are dynamic, but not as eclectic as this peice of work. This is an album that can appeal to everyone. The gothic fans, the beatnik fans, the ballad fans, the country fans, the jazz/blues enthusiasts. Tom even dabbles in straight up pop (Downtown Train). I can't stress the need to buy this album. Own it. Hold it. Kiss it and cuddle it while you sleep. Tom is twice the lyricist that Dylan was and twice the songwriter of anyone he's ever influenced. He's without a doubt one of the great american poets and singers. He has a place made and ready for him in Rock and Roll Heaven. Thank you, Tom, for everything this album has meant to anyone who's ever been gripped in its infinite power.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This dark and somber picture deals with a sensitive and awful sexual abuse. A tragic chronicle that sealed three different existences. Add the physical wounds the unforgettable traces left in the mind and the soul. Three friends who just are in his teenages, one of them will be designed by the destiny's finger as the innocent victim of that crime.<br />The silence will be the common denominator, but the damage is too big to heal these emotional wounds. And so slowly, the destiny will assume the form of a long cloud that literally will gather them again, thirty years later.<br />Eastwood reached the peak as hard to beat director; with a simple story but rich in details and edition. Between you and me this film and 21 grams were the most pyramidal american films in 2003 but you know, the logic usually doesn 't apply as a mathematic equation, and this outstanding picture was simply nominated and nothing else happened. The cast is simply terrific. And the absorbing photography is another invisible actor.<br />A film that will shock your senses for a long, long time!
B0007XT7V8|4.0|This is a awesome CD, better than there last. The only problem that I have is that somehow i seem to have gotten an edited version of the CD but there is only one version to buy in the store and it did not say edited on it. Has this happened to anyone else? I don't need to here bad lanuage to make the music good, but it just makes me mad that if you are going to say it than say it and if you don't want to say it than don't but it is very poor to put out an album with blank spaced in it!
0151008787|5.0|True to its title, this is a no holds barred personal masterpiece. Perhaps, this is the book that one should read before any of his other works because you can see so much of his fiction coming from his personal life. <br /> <br />As a long time fan of Amos Oz, I was not prepared for this extremely personal non linier biography of his early life. While jumping from his granparents to his parents history to the present time, he manages to weave a lucid memory of his childhood, the relationship of his parents, grandparents, and the amount of secrecy that many of us, contemporaries of his, though not Israelis were raised to not question. <br /> <br />Mr. Oz, on the other hand has discarded the family covertness of that time. Learning so much about his life, I will have to become a re-reader of some of his novels and will look at the ones I have not read with new enlightenment.
0800177177|4.0|I rather liked this adaption of my favorite noval by Bram Stoker. Honestly, the movie wasn't bad at all (though the garden scene to this day kinda freaks me out) though I will honestly say: the movie can have points/moments where it becomes rather boring, as it is a rather long movie. <br />I also didn't like the portrail of Mina Harker.  Don't get me wrong, Winona Ryder is a wonderful actress and played the part beautifully: but as I continued to watch the movie, I couldn't help but keep calling the character this one...word.  And here's a hint: it stars with an 'S'. (This was probably because I looked at it from a realistic point of view: your husband has gone missing, you get from his letters that something might be wrong, yet here you are, going out to dinner with this guy and you're engaged to another man...) <br /> <br />But seriously: it really is a great movie and so far, my favorite adaption of Bram Stoker's infamous novel.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Hans Zimmer is a composer who's best known for his big, loud synth-flavored film scores.  As good as wroks like \\"Crimson Tide\\" and \\"Gladitor\\" are, some of his best work has been on more intimate scores such as \\"The Thin Red Line\\", and \\"As Good as it Gets\\".  Here, he combines his gentle, underappreciated stylings with his more popular action fare.  The action music is certainly excellent, with pounding taiko drums and very memorable themes.  At a first listen, this music will catch your attention and impress you from the start.  But, as with the best scores, repeat listenings reap great benefits.  After you are able to hear all the little things Hans is doing in the quiet music, you're really able to fully enjoy and appreciate this score.  It's also pleasant to finally hear Zimmer write an entire score by himself.  By all means, I'm in favor of his \\"Composer-support-group\\" methods, but it's a rarity to hear Mr. Z write a score all on his own these days, so that's a nice surprise.  Despite the popularity of his \\"Gladiator\\" score, Zimmer takes that style of mixing the epic and intimate and improves on it here.  One of Hans Zimmer's best scores.
B00000099Y|5.0|now they r one of my favorites. Tool has awesome lyrics, great songwriting, one of a hell of a cover lol. and the songs just rock.
1563898586|5.0|Extremely fun to read. Alan Moore's build up of characters and storytelling is rarely seen in comics, with so much attention to detail. The artwork is simple but very effective, with excellent panel construction. I especially liked the positioning of the \\"surprise\\" panels, being placed as the first panel of the odd pages. Haven't seen the movie, but after reading the comic, I certanly will.
B0002X314C|5.0|I bought this cd with no much intersting but i need to say JL is amazing! <br />His beat and his voice is unique and way better then other singers actually out with their works <br />Stay with me is my fav! <br /> <br />buy it and u will no regret!
B00005JNEI|1.0|I saw this film and thought \\"well it is clearly one sided but in some points it seemed true and the interviews seemed genuine\\". But some things sounded fishy and down right propaganda. Then to be fair I saw the other view \\"FahrenHYPE 9/11\\",and my eyes were opened wide. the same people interviewed in Fahrenheit 9/11 were also in FahrenHYPE 9/11 saying how what they said was edited and manipulated, and all the Bush footage was shown uncut so you could see what was really said and manipulated in  Michael Moore's film. I have to tell you I have never seen a film so manipulating and full of lies like Moore's film. I felt insulted and mislead. I then decided to check all the facts myself and after a deep and long finding of facts it was clear. Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11 was full of lies and manipulated facts wile \\"FahrenHYPE 9/11\\" was 100% true. Look I am a left wing tree hugger but the truth is the truth and Moore's film is a lie. If you want the truth I suggest you watch \\"FahrenHYPE 9/11\\", and then check for your self. You will see the same as me, Fahrenheit 9/11 is the furthest from the truth you will ever see and \\"FahrenHYPE 9/11\\" is the closest to the truth.
B000000OQF|5.0|but im hoping to get it today, ive only heard a few songs and i think its freakin awesome so im pretty sure the rest will kickazz too
B0007OCG4W|2.0|If you watch movies for the quality of the acting than this is a good one cause all the actors play atypical roles and do a great job.  But if you watch movies to be taken away from the reality of life and feel good, this is NOT the movie for you.   <br /> <br />The characters screw each other over and you have trouble buying that any of them with the possible exception of the Natalie Portman character really care about the people they are supposedly in love with.  What's more you will have a hard time really caring about any of them.  The Julia Roberts - Clive Owens story is one of the single most depressing couplings I've ever seen on film.  This is not a feel good movie by any stretch of the imagination.  The only way it might make you feel good is if you think you're own relationship is dysfunctional, it might seem better by comparision.  But if that's not the kind of feel good you are looking for don't waste your time or your money.

B0007TKNKG|5.0|I have always thought that this was Stallones best movie.  All of his other movies he plays a tough macho guy. In this movie he displays emotions that cause this to be one of his best movies.  My father never liked him, but when he saw this movie he said that Stallone really impressed him.  Stallone plays a down to earth trucker who had married into wealth.  Him and his wife got a divorce and his son was sent to a military school.  His wife is in the hospital about to die and she wants Stallone and her son to get to know each other.  Of course the boy starts off being a smart a** brat who hates his father due to the brain washing of his grandfather.  But by the end of the movie the son (as well as other fans of Stallone) come to love him.  Stallone shows the caring side that he don't display in other movies.  Awesome movie and I am glad that it is finally coming out on DVD.  Well worth the watch and adding to your collections
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Jason Bourne, his memory haunted by only shadowy, fleeting glimpses of his murky past, is now living with his girlfriend in what he thinks is an incognito existence somewhere in India.   This tranquil setting is shattered suddenly when yet another assassin appears one day to kill him.  The tragic events that follow prompt him to come out of hiding to seek revenge and perhaps finally to resolve the enduring questions about his identity.  So begins a new odyssey called the Bourne Supremacy.    In took me two viewings to appreciate the full value of the first movie in this series.  I finally discovered that, despite the seemingly incomprehensible secret-agent-speak and the multiple movements of bodies and objects, there was a complex and interesting story just beneath the surface.  Filled with many of the same compelling elements- pathos, action, suspense, intrigue- The Bourne Supremacy is a worthy sequel to the original, but it is also an entertaining thriller in its own right.    A strong screenplay from Tony Gilroy (who also wrote the one for Identity) maintains the quality of the story line, explaining even more of the riddles surrounding Jason Bourne's past and his attempts at redemption.   Shot once again on location in major European cities, further continuity is provided by the appearance of almost all of the original cast members who reprise their roles. The addition of academy award-winning Joan Allen who is effective as Pamela Landy, the ambitious but ethical CIA Supervisor of Operations, only bolsters that line-up.    Unfortunately, however, this does not measure up to its predecessor, and what flaws there are can be traced to the man at the helm.  Doug Liman, Director on Bourne Identity, was the real force behind that project.  Indeed, he not only crafted an excellent movie but was also the one who had initially obtained the movie rights to the Robert Ludlam novel by making a personal visit to the author's home and then shopping it painstakingly to the studios.  Although new director Paul Greengrass is faithful to the spirit and winning formula of that film, his approach forces us to be infrequently, but nonetheless noticeably distracted.  While Identity was undeniably an action picture, it was substantially character-driven. Supremacy, on the other hand, tips the balance in the other direction.  Greengrass gives us a little too much gratuitous violence and a few too many scenes that stretch the bounds of believability, including an agonizingly long final car chase. Other problems flow simply from his technique. We are informed that he went to great ends in order to achieve a sense of realism such as eschewing the use of computerized or other \\"special\\" effects in the stunt scenes.  That he is one of a group of new directors who are once again employing these kinds of methods perhaps signals a welcome return to authentic film making, and I praise him for his effort. Yet, it appears he has taken this principle too far.  For example, his desire to obtain a \\"gritty texture\\" from many of his camera shots, so common in documentary films, the genre from which he draws his experience, often results in an image which is dull and even worse, not visible.  His extensive use of hand-held cameras in his action sequences likewise can be too much of a good thing. With the repeated, shaking frames during that car chase to which I referred, for instance, we may indeed feel as if we're in a speeding, careening vehicle, but it's at the cost of being able to see what's actually happening.     Despite these imperfections, this is still a very enjoyable movie yet not as much as the Bourne Identity.  Too bad; had the director limited his love affair with style, the substance would have been enhanced and Supremacy could have been a much better film.
1932100385|5.0|I purchased this book based on the following review.  I'm posting it here because it was helpful to me and I figured it would be helpful to someone else...enjoy! <br /> <br />The China Study  <br /> <br />Oprah has a book club, and now, so do I! Each week, I manage  <br />to read two or three books, and from time to time, I'll  <br />be sharing my favorites with you. This past week, I  <br />made the exception to my own rule, and read one book from  <br />comer to cover--twice! This must-read book is \\"The China  <br />Study,\\" by T. Colin Campbell and his son, Thomas. T. Colin  <br />Campbell (the dad) is a great writer in his own right, but  <br />this new father and son team have synergized their energies  <br />to create a classic in the genre of nutritional texts.  <br /> <br />Early on in their brilliantly written book (page 21),  <br />the Campbells tell their readers:  <br /> <br />\\"So, what is the prescription for good health? In short, it  <br />is about the multiple health benefits of consuming plant-  <br />based foods, and the largely unappreciated health dangers  <br />of consuming animal-based foods, including all types of  <br />meat, dairy, and eggs.\\"  <br /> <br />That's a pretty good start, and it gets even better.  <br /> <br />T. Colin Campbell's perspectives are simply amazing. On page  <br />21, he expresses a contrarian philosophy to most modern-day  <br />health gurus:  <br /> <br />\\"One of the more exciting benefits of good nutrition  <br />is the prevention of diseases that are thought to be  <br />due to genetic predisposition.\\"  <br /> <br />Campbell has learned throughout his esteemed career that  <br />disease can easily be reversed and cured by adopting  <br />a plant-based diet.  <br /> <br />By quoting Goethe on page 27, Campbell exposes America's  <br />great protein myth, as promoted by the all-powerful milk  <br />and meat industries. He writes:  <br /> <br />\\"We are best at hiding those things which are in plain site.\\"  <br /> <br/>Campbell's sense of humor is at its best in this upscale  <br />well-documented book. His chapter on protein consumption  <br />should be read by every American. Healthy people should  <br />reinforce good physiology by Campbell's advice, and ill people  <br />should be inspired to take the cure by eating a plant-based  <br />diet. On page 30, Campbell asks:  <br /> <br />\\"Can you guess what food we might eat to most efficiently  <br />provide the building blocks for our replacement proteins?  <br />The answer is human flesh.\\"  <br /> <br />Very funny! Of course, most are not willing to live on Mrs.  <br />Lovett's human meat pies. Or are we? The trouble is, with  <br />human and animal flesh, there are many dangerous byproducts  <br />to consider. The urea, ammonia, and dirty residues of animal  <br />proteins and saturated fats compromise carnivores.  <br /> <br />Campbell is at his best when writing about \\"Broken Hearts\\"  <br />on page 111. You will learn that during the Korean War, 77.3  <br />percent of healthy hearts autopsied from American casualties  <br />revealed advanced heart disease. These diseased hearts were  <br />taken from the bodies of so-called healthy males who had  <br />eaten the standard American diet. Campbell offers the hows  <br />and whys of heart disease...and the cure-all.  <br /> <br />On page 255, Campbell walks you through the American  <br />government's relationship with milk and meat producers.  <br />Conspiracy? Absolutely, and Campbell's detailed evidence  <br />and research reads like a detective story. One smoking gun  <br />after another overwhelms the reader into recognizing  <br />that things could have been different for our children  <br />had only those men in power possessed ethics. If only they  <br />had respected real science and not the almighty dollar.  <br />We have been betrayed, and T. Colin Campbell has survived  <br />in an academic environment despite those pressures exerted by  <br />bureaucrats with enormous financial conflicts of interest.  <br /> <br />Campbell's commentary on nutritional training, or the lack  <br />thereof for doctors is magnificent. On page 327, Campbell writes:  <br /> <br />\\"The situation is dangerous. Nutrition training of doctors  <br />is not merely inadequate; it is practically nonexistent...The  <br />bulk of these nutrition hours are taught in the first year of  <br />medical school, as part of other basic science courses...When  <br />nutrition education is provided in relation to public health  <br />problems, guess who is supplying the 'educational' material?  <br />The Dannon Institute, Egg Nutrition Board, National Cattlemen's  <br />Beef Association, National Dairy Council, Nestle Clinical  <br />Nutrition, Wyeth-Ayerst Labortories, Briston-Myers Squibb  <br />Company...\\"  <br /> <br />Campbell then asks:  <br /> <br />\\"Do you think that this all-star team of animal foods and drug  <br />industries representatives is going to objectively judge and  <br />promote optimal nutrition, which science has shown to be a  <br />whole foods, plant-based diet that minimizes the need for drugs?\\"  <br /> <br />The book is a must read for those who know a thing or two, and  <br />those who have not a clue. I've read no better book on nutrition  <br />than this one, which will arm you in nutritional arguments  <br />presented by meat-eating doubting Thomases.  <br /> <br />The China Study, by T. Colin Campbell, PhD, with Thomas  <br />Campbell is available on Amazon.com:  <br /> <br />[...]  <br /> <br />Robert Cohen  <br />[...]  <br /> <br />
B00000272N|5.0|i love this cd it was the 1st Alice in chains  cd i ever bought   i love it because of the grunge guitar and layne voice just   absolutly amazing can say this is their best album that they put   out so if you're looking for true alice in chains get this cd
B0006VIE4C|4.0|Too much of a Star Wars geek, methinks... In the original Star Wars, right after Obiwan's death, Darth Vader can be seen wandering around with his lightsaber...except it wasn't coloured red, because they'd forgotten to colour it in. In the Special Edition, back in 1997, I had expected this fixed, but they somehow had time to add in all sorts of special things, but not to fix this bug. Well, finally, on the new Star Wars DVD, its finally fixed.
B0002IU988|5.0|Composition, lyrics, etc. are all great here but the real point is that finally (after years)a band has come along and realizes that more can be done with a guitar than merely churning out power chords.  Praise the Lord and let lead guitar return to its rightful place in the rock music genre.  Thank you, Alter Bridge.  Hopefully you have started a trend. <br /> <br />
B0007CNXUK|5.0|A superb film.That is what it is.Johnny Depp plays it with incredible ease.Kate Winslet is wonderful for him to play off of. And the boys...who had me believeing the parts they played.While I enjoyed \\"HOOK\\",this is a more satisfying film,to watch the story come to life.Any other year, and this would have cleaned up on the Oscars.
B00005JNPZ|5.0|Hitch is side-splitting comedy and surprisingly not completely devoid of useful relationship information! There are definitely some quotable quotes in this movie! Will Smith is charming as Alex Hitchens who helps relationship-challenged men find happiness by showing them what to do and what not to do to sweep women off their feet. He may be a candidate for weirdest last name on film, made to fit the movie but it doesn't matter and if you think having a name like Hitchens is weird, think about the girl named Cressida! The idea of Will Smith failing to impress a woman seemed almost alien, but Will made me a believer with his portrayal of young Hitch getting dumped on by his first love. <br />This movie makes you think the idea of a person like Hitch might be a good thing! He may be a little extreme sometimes, and maybe even irrelevant at other times, but men do need someone like him to help them, and though the movie did not acknowledge this directly, Hitch was helpful in the most important way and that was in inspiring men with the confidence they needed to go after the women they wanted! You will enjoy Hitch's charm as much as his crazy exploits in trying to capture a woman of his own. This film is original, and that alone recommends it, but if that's not enough, you have an entertaining storyline and stellar performances by the entire cast. It is pure entertainment at its best and relatively cleanest! I think there was 1 \\"green verb,\\" which is why I say \\"relatively cleanest\\"! <br />I also enjoyed the music on this film, but I think it could have been made unforgettable with a special theme song. Titanic had Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On,' Pretty Woman had Roxette's 'Must Have Been Love' and also the Roy Orbison title song, Nottinghill had Al Green's 'How Can You Mend A Broken Heart', Shrek had 'All Star,' The Sound of Music had the title song by Julie Andrews and Mary Poppins had Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! I could go on but you get the point, it justseemed like Hitch needed that one signature song to accentuate an important moment in the movement of the plot. I did enjoy the opening song and the other tracks however and the movie is fantastic so I will be ordering it on DVD.
079284131X|5.0|Eventually a special edition will have to come up it has to the region 1 NTSC version of Child's Play is in fullscreen (4*3 1:33:1) which is'nt its original ratio its also quite grainy the region 2 PAL is in un-anamorphic widecsreen (16*9 1:85:1) and they are both in terrible stereo now if MGM did a special edition of Species they can do one of this and if we're lucky anchor bay might buy the rights like they bought Bubba ho-tep off MGM hopefully one or the other will evenyually happen I have given 5 stars for the film for now best bet is to buy the region 2 PAL version
0792165020|5.0|Great movie!  A thinking man's thriller, yes, featuring a talented cast and no clunky performances.  Mid-century Italy is lensed so beautifully here you'll be calling a travel agent.  Bikes on narrow streets.  A flock of birds rising in a roomy town square.  Heaped fruit.  Boats leaning in the wind on the sun-kissed coast. <br /> <br />Matt Damon plays the lead character, Tom Ripley, a closeted gay man whose self-hatred has fueled a talent to mimic others, to become them even, to find the place where admiration crosses into imitation and then into immolation.  In short he destroys those he draws creepily close to. <br /> <br />Jude Law's Dickie barely tolerates Ripley-the-tagalong after Dickie's worried dad sends Tom to retrieve him from the coast of Italy where he's living on his looks and charisma, enjoying jazz and sailing on the family dole.  Tom quickly envies Dickie's life, which seems to pass with dreamlike ease and includes a blonde beautiful woman (Gwenyth Paltrow in a flawless performance).  Dickie does tolerate Tom despite his seeming mundanity, however, because he senses a powerful and flattering obsession directed at him. <br /> <br />The movie, suffused in Italian sunlight, eventually reveals frightening darkness in the psyches of BOTH its male leads.  If Tom is a Borderline Personality, then Dickie is at least Histrionic, incapable of maintaining interest in anyone or anything for very long; neither character, then, has a secure core identity.  Sex and death are always interesting, so the erotic scene of Tom and Dickie playing chess with the latter nude in a bathtub and the violent scene of confrontation on a rowboat give two fine actors a chance to plumb intense emotions, which they do with great skill and sensitivity. <br /> <br />Damon's Ripley mimicks speaking voices, signatures, identities, and in one chilling scene the soft expressive singing voice of jazz great Chet Baker.  By this sunny film's end, the darkness of a closing door incrementallyfills the screen as we realize the full depths of the sociopathic nature of Tom Ripley, now on the run from the police. <br /> <br />Viewers will encounter great acting from the principals (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Matt Damon, Jude Law, & Gwenyth Paltrow) and great direction from Anthony Minghella--who inserts a darkening character study and an effective thriller about shifting identities into a sunny sensual Mediterranean setting and a swirl of golden age jazz.   <br /> <br />At once disconcerting and stylish, \\"Ripley\\" isn't just a good movie but a masterwork.

B00005MP58|5.0|I've never seen a better book adaptation in my life. The costumes, sets and scenery are a visual feast. The screenplay and direction are just superb and the background music, what can I say, just fabulous but most of all the whole cast is perfectly put together and even the supporting characters acted very well indeed. Some of them may not look like the characters we have in mind but they acted their characters to parfection especially Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. I have seen other adaptation of PnP and they failed to capture the true character of Mr Darcy. Colin Firth showed every single emotions that Mr Darcy felt from the time he met Lizzy.No other Mr Darcy managed to convey the many different subtle emotional struggles of Mr Darcy that Jane Austen mentioned in her book. Colin Firth is the definitive Mr Darcy.This latest production of PnP is a must see. I was inspired to read the book after watching this excellent production. Now everytime I read the book the characters just come alive in my mind. The 1940 PnP movie is not close to the book at all but as a movie it is very entertaining. The 1980 adaptation is just plain awful, it bored me to tears. It is good as a stage play but as a movie Im not impressed.I would never be encouraged to read the book if I had seen the earlier version first. I recommend the 1995 production, it is a masterpiece.
0810945797|5.0|The eyes, ears and hearts of many people have been profoundly affected by the film THE DARK CRYSTAL - and this exquisite tome reveals some of the answers as to why. <br /> <br />Froud and Henson did not simply think up a story based on old tales, although that was one of their sources.  No--they created a new WORLD, based on ancient human sources of mysticism and cosmic law.  Every facet of their art was influenced by the spiritual truths and aspirations of our planet, and by extension, these alien races as well, strange as they may appear. <br /> <br />To fully appreciate the brilliance of what Froud, Henson and Oz achieved, this book is vital.  In loving detail, it explains the origins of the creatures of the DARK CRYSTAL world, their customs, their beliefs, the way their world's structure influences their anatomy, behavior and culture.   <br /> <br />It becomes clear why this film, though never a box-office success, has been deemed a classic by those who appreciate high-quality fantasy, and moreover, mythology--which represents the inner truths of all sentient beings. <br /> <br />In short, it is of a piece with its cinematic counterpart--something truly soul-nourishing.  If you appreciated the movie, I can unhesitatingly say that a copy of this should be yours, and at this (in-print) price, it is undervalued.
0553382179|5.0|This book, and the FlyLady website, have literally changed how I feel about myself. After reading this book, hearing Marla speak in person, and visiting the website, I learned that I was not alone in struggling to keep a home presentable. I used to think something was wrong with me for living in CHAOS. Marla gave me hope, and a new found feeling that I can do this a little at a time. Her methods are unique, but her constant boosts of \\"you are not alone', and 'you are not behind', have helped me tremendously. She is the best cheerleader any woman who is struggling with making a house a peaceful home can have.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book and the website highly. Thank you, Marla!!!

B0000AFQS0|5.0|\\"The Kids Are Alright\\" was my most proper introduction to the Who, and I watched it obsessively.   <br /> <br />Jeff Stein's rocumentary has set the standard for all to follow, in terms of research, documentation, interviews and the technical aspects.  The DVD's bonus material, commentaries and the like fill out just how it all really came together. <br /> <br />I especially was glad to see the restored footage, though there wasn't as much as I thought there'd be.  In any case, nice to see all of the Who's performance of \\"A Quick One\\" during the Rolling Stones \\"Rock n' Roll Circus.\\" <br /> <br />The film showed the band in its various stages, including the show stopping performance at Woodstock, plus the London performance of \\"Young Man Blues.\\" <br /> <br />Keith Moon of course became very much the star of the film, especially as he died during the final production work.  Moon the Loon was shown both as the brilliant drummer he was, and as the inane practical joker (witness the strip tease on the \\"Russell Harty Plus\\" show). <br /> <br />This remains one of my favorite films of all time, from the entertainment value, but also a great document of the Who at the height of their power.

B00005AREQ|5.0|Simply put, this is a superb CD! I got this CD when it first came out and it remains a favorite. Beck and the band were firing on all cylinders on this release. From the funkiness of the opening track to the great ensemble jamming on 'Scatterbrain' the band simply cooks! 'Cause We've Ended As Lovers' is an absolutely beautiful display of sweet, emotion-filled guitar playing. Jeff plays as if someone just broke his heart and the emotion is pouring out. I get chills every time I hear this track, just beautifully played. And kudos to a very fine drummer, the ever funky and tight Richard Bailey. He has a knack for knowing what to play and when to play it and gets a chance to showcase his tasteful drumming without overplaying and showing off. I haven't heard all of Beck's albums so I don't know if this ranks as his best but man, it's gotta be right there! This is what I call a must-have CD. Brilliant!
B000002U82|5.0|Greatest album of mankind, essential to any collection. Do not wait to get it, GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!
B0007DAZW8|3.0|I had a lot of songs off Discovery downloaded before I ever got the album.  My friend bought it for me for my birthday and it seriously is one of the best albums I have.  Combine that with the amazingness of Interstella 5555 and you just can't compete. <br /> <br />When Human After All was released, I didn't know it was coming out.  I hadn't been paying attention.  I bought it though, hoping for some of the same things I absolutely loved about Discovery.  But maybe the joy of discoveries is over, and now it's time to settle down. <br /> <br />The main problem I keep hearing about this album is it's droning repetetiveness.  I mostly agree.  Some of these songs just go on a bit too long.  I shouldn't have to change the track just to hear a slight variation.  Specially with Daft Punk.  So as I'm flipping through the tracks, Im getting more and more upset.  What IS this?  Someone told me that, while it took years for them to release a new album, they only spent a few weeks in the studio on it.  Can you rush art?  Destiny's Child's latest says NO! <br /> <br />There is one acceptable track off the album, which is why I gave the CD three starts.  \\"Technologic\\".  That little voice and the music behind just captivate me every time.  I'm stuck, until the track is over.  I wish the rest of the album had been even remotely like this one track.  I really do.

B00003CXCT|2.0|For certain Amazonians who don't carefully read what others have posted... the position stated in the \\"Gotta Get This Off My Chest\\" posting does not dispute the fact that Lucas does, of course, have EVERY RIGHT to do whatever he wants with the vast universe he's created. However, the ORIGINAL \\"Star Wars\\" should not be lost from existence in the process, since it is a genuine piece of film history. No matter what Lucas calls it, it is much more than a \\"work in progress\\"! I don't care how many \\"Special Extendo Director's Deluxe Definitive\\" editions of the movies become available in the years to come. The more the merrier.  Clearly, no one has ANY right to demand that Lucas stops changing his own movies. Just ALSO give us the original 1977 film that changed cinema (for better AND for worse), NOT to satisfy our 70s nostalgia, but to represent an extremely important turning point in film history. <br /> <br />The \\"two stars\\" rating I've given this boxed set is for the uneven quality of the DVD presentation (which was outlined thoroughly in the earlier \\"Gotta Get This Off My Chest\\" posting), and not for any personal opinions about the merit of \\"Greedo shooting first\\" or \\"Hayden at the end of Return Of The Jedi\\". <br />
B00005JNTV|5.0|Sin City takes place within a corrupt and criminal environment where evil and suspicious characters seem to rule the city.  Daylight never seems to reach this place where human transgressions seem to be the norm, as shadows and darkness enhance the gloomy milieu in which the characters exist.  This film is the very archetype of film noir as no one can trust anyone and death lurks around every corner.  The film's heroes are less than perfect with either a dark past or they suffer from some terminal condition.  Everything is perfect in regards to film noir, yet the world is as far as possible from an utopia as life is easily expendable and everyone is guilty of something.<br /><br />In three of Frank Miller's graphic novels Sin City has generated the foundation for the films, as the audience get the opportunity to follow three disconnected adventures.  These three adventures lead the audience into a dark place, an unwanted domain if it was real, but the black and white cinematography make it look and feel like the graphic novel that Miller created.  This makes the film tolerable, as the violence is extreme, detailed, and intense.  If Sin City was shot in the spirit of Spider-Man (2002) the film would be extremely gory, grotesque, and probably would not be allowed in theater throughout the United States.  Thus, as mentioned, the black and white cinematography makes the film tolerable and viewable, but it also surpasses the cinematography from other graphic novels by light-years, as it displays brilliance.<br /><br />The adventures are all divided up by the women in the story, which are an essential part of the atmosphere of the film.  None of the women seem to be over the age of 25 while they all are prostitutes with daring clothing revealing more than covering.  The prostitution and the sexually suggestive environment intensifies the sleaziness of the criminal milieu, which enhances the distrusting atmosphere.  However, the women in Sin City are no feeble women.  These women do not mind pulling the trigger when it counts, or swinging a blade if necessary.  Nonetheless, these women also bring out the little good and human compassion, if one can call it that, which is a rare commodity in Basin City where the stories take place.<br /><br />After the film's opening the audience is introduced to the cop Harrigan (Bruce Willis) who is about to make his final arrest before retirement.  This arrest attempt leads Harrigan to reveal the location where he can find a psychopathic killer that sexually lusts for torturing young girls.  He is also aware that the pedophile has recently kidnapped a young girl named Nancy.  However, this psycho-killer is not unknown to him, as he has slipped his grasp many times before.  The psychopath is the son of the mayor, and this could lead to some major difficulty for Harrigan through the mayor's influential powers.<br /><br />Following Harrigan's case, the audience gets to follow Marv (Mickey Rourke), an ex-convict with delusional tendencies and a beautiful parole officer.  Marv has just met and had his best intimate moment with Goldie.  When Marv awakens from his sexually exhausted slumber he discovers that Goldie is dead and the cops have already been tipped.  Angry and vengeful Marv escapes the trap in order to find the true identity behind Goldie's killer, which leads the audience into a blood splattered river that flows from Marv's path.<br /><br />Shellie's (Brittany Murphy) ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) instigates the third adventure where the freedom of the girls in the Old Time comes in jeopardy, as the truce between the cops, the mob, and the prostitutes is crumbling.  The hero in this tale is Dwight (Clive Owen), a criminal with a recent face job, who turns into the knight in shining armor, but much better than in King Arthur (2004).  This sequence displays the strength that the women possess when they decide enough is enough, which of course turns very bloody.<br /><br />There areseveral elements in the film that make this film brilliant, but one must begin with expressing gratitude to the casting directors Beth Sepko and Mary Vernieu who put together a splendid cast.  The cast consists of actors such as Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Jessica Alba and many others.  A couple of the highlights are Rourke's performance as Marv, as he brings out the dirty and nasty in a delusional criminal who is on a murderous destructive path while Del Toro's performance as Jackie Boy is simply excellent.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez who has directed several action films is a perfect choice to lead this project, as he also had help from Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino.  The scenes are full of speed, action, and nitty-gritty violence, which intentionally goes over the top with high frequency.  This exaggerated violence often seems humorous and will occasionally force the audience into laughter.  However, laughing at mutilation is hardly acceptable, which suggests that the audience is as guilty to the crime as the perpetrator.  This is a cleverly incorporation of the visual theme that no one is innocent, as all are guilty, even the audience members.  Furthermore, the heavy use of cerebral character monologues enhances the audience's cerebral participation in the film, as little is left for the imagination, yet it leaves the audience contemplating moral values./>There are several elements in the film that make this film brilliant, but one must begin with expressing gratitude to the casting directors Beth Sepko and Mary Vernieu who put together a splendid cast.

1400032717|5.0|This illuminating book, hindered by unnecessary profanity, is narrated by 15 year old Christopher John Francis Boone, who attends special school in Swindon where he lives with his supposedly widowed father. Christopher says of himself - \\"I do not like people shouting at me. It makes me scared...and I do not know what is going to happen\\". His response - \\"I put my hands over my ears and close my eyes\\". Sometimes he does \\"groaning\\" to generate white noise to drown out other noises, which sometimes come into his head from too many sources all at once creating an overload on his ability to process the plethora of details. He can't take crowds or being ordered, but he can take A-level maths. People are often unpredictable to Christopher, but animals are safe. He has a pet rat named Toby and he likes dogs - \\"Dogs do not tell lies\\", such as \\"I laughed my sock off\\". When Wellington, the neighbour lady's dog, is found killed by a garden fork, Christopher decides to do a Sherlock Holmes and track down the culprit. Christopher knows this will entail having to interact with people, which requires social skills that he has yet to understand let alone master. But before he learns who killed Wellington, he uncovers a family secret so shocking that he lies unconscious in his own \\"sick\\" for a few hours before awaking to learn the identity of the dog's killer. In fright for his personal safety, Christopher flees Swindon for London. The flight is fraught with problems peculiar to his developmental handicaps, which put him on an emotional roller coaster. The reader of this piece will no doubt cry during the plot at those times when Christopher, badly shaken, cannot because he's not in touch with his emotions that are however in touch with him. Besides generating a great deal of empathy, the author Mark Haddon will have the reader wondering if he/she is not a tad bit autistic as well. Lastly, the 3 doors incident in the story purportedly from Parade magazine is not accurate. When faced with choosing between the 2 remaining doors, you are either repicking the originally picked door or you are picking the other door; it's a new situation that has nothing to do with the previous one.

B00080ZG10|4.0|Recognition for Martin Scorsese, famous for his cult-classic dramas such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas, from the Motion Picture Academy has been since been long overdue. Several critics proclaimed in 2002 that his extensive filmography alone justified him being awarded the golden statuette while still others argued that merit came before popularity and legacy anytime. Thankfully, he failed to garner a win two years ago for Gangs of New York, a wretched train-wreck that was hardly worth recognition in the light of his glamorous filmmaking legacy, though on the other hand it was truly painful to have seen the award given to Roman Polanski, the infamous coward, pervert, and all-around loathsome character. The Aviator, once again starring heart-throb Leonardo DiCaprio, may at last be the picture that scores Scorsese that ever elusive award statuette with critics abound applauding it and audiences flocking consistently w weekend in and weekend out to see it. Can Oscar be too far off in his future? Only time, as well as the votes of academy members, will tell for sure. <br /> <br />The story centers on but a small window of the life of the legendary Howard Hughes, from 1930 to 1947 to be precise, the time in which he was the most active before leaving Hollywood, as well as the world, and becoming a total recluse hiding out in his Las Vegas casinos until 1971 when he died of kidney failure. Born the son of a Texas drill bit inventor in 1905, Howard Hughes was taught by his mother to fear germs and disease, which included any contact that would result in direct contact with them. When his father died, he was left with seventy-five percent stake in Hughes Tool Co. and looked toward the West to expand his already immense fortune. Moving to the state of California, Hughes set up shop as a hot-shot Hollywood producer, starting off with Hell's Angels, a black and white World War I epic essentially the equivalent to today's B-action flicks. He became known as the eccentric perfectionist, waiting excruciating periods of time simply for cloud formations in the background of aerial sequences, thus sending the production cost soaring. In the end the film went down with the largest production budget in cinema history at the time, costing a then whopping four million dollars. Hughes would go on to the test the very limits of the Motion Picture Association's ratings board with the violently graphic Scarface in 1932 and the sexually explicit The Outlaw in 1943. Also during this time, Hughes, a dashing young billionaire and the toast of tinsel town, romanced many of the most dazzling starlets of the era including Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow, and Faith Domergue. Expanding upon his fascination with the aviation industry, Howard Hughes goes on to purchase the airline industry that would become TWA. And working under contracts for the Department of Defense of the United States of America during World War II, his creation of The Hercules, or better known under its more infamous name the \\"Spruce Goose\\", would land Hughes in hot water and be pressured to collapse all control of the aviation industry to Pan Am by Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, supposedly on the payroll of Pan Am owner Juan Trippe. Hughes' eccentric and bizarre behavior, which would later be categorized as either a bipolar disorder or paranoid-schizophrenia, was exposed to the public and he faces scrutiny at the hands of a corrupt system of which he is willing to go to war with to prove his innocence. <br /> <br />The story for The Aviator resurrects the aberrant life of Howard Hughes and presents it in the grandiose, nostalgic, and mythological style that only Martin Scorsese could have achieved so seamlessly and effectively all at the same time. In spite of its lavish three-hour time length, the film's flow and consistency is never once interrupted by abrupt slow periods, nor does it ever outpace its audience's ability to divulge information at a reasonable pace. Already at this point it is leaps and bounds ahead of the bumbling monstrosity that was Gangs of New York. And although the first few minutes of the picture in which Hughes' mother bathes the young boy in a tub of water in a dimly lit room and speaks to him of avoiding the disease-filled residence of a neighbor may seem a bit awkward when it first starts out, given time it will be made all the more understandable as eloquent symbolism to the sporadic nature of Howard Hughes. <br /> <br />Howard Hughes, whether he be the man, the legend, or quite possibly a combination of the two, truly is the focus of this picture and Leonardo DiCaprio, having been snubbed in years past for his roles in both Titanic and Gangs of New York, captures brilliantly the eccentric aviator's maverick personality and from the very first scenes instantly grapples the attention of his audience in much the same way as Hughes would have wanted it done. Whether or not he receives a golden statuette this time around, let alone receives a nomination at the Academy Awards ceremony, DiCaprio, in the short years since his breakout performance in the smash-hit Titanic, has built up quite an impressive resume none-the-less, especially given that he has actually demonstrated true acting potential rather then simply riding the wave of pure publicity and hype. Cate Blanchett, an especially gifted actress who has rounded up in recent years particularly well-deserved acclaim from critics for her roles in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Veronica Guerin, reflects perfectly the extraordinary, if not often curious, nature of the late-Katharine Hepburn. Though this is almost certainly going to be overlooked by the members of the academy when it comes time to divvy up nominations for the Best Supporting Actor category this year, John C. Reilly's portrayal of Noah Dietrich, Hughes' company accountant and dear friend, deserves recognition for providing a structured counter-balance personality to the divergent Howard Hughes. Alan Alda, famous for his portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce in the acclaimed television series M*A*S*H, proves that in all his years in the glitzy Hollywood business he has failed to lose his touch, giving a brilliantly stark performance as the conniving Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. In a particular scene in which the senator invites Howard to a luncheon meeting in a last ditch effort to avoid a public hearing and have him fold on the refutation of his new aviation bill, he appears as though he takes pleasure in tormenting Hughes' now apparent mental condition, going so far as to pick up a glass at the last minute and place a smudge mark on it directly in Hughes' line of sight. Splendidly Hughes, refusing to be baited and racking his bodily functions to fight back the affects of his mental condition, stuns Brewster by drinking straight out of that glass and forces him to be on the defensive, a position no one, let alone a senator of the United States Congress, finds comfortable. Surely not everything that Hughes did, most notably taking money from the government for projects he never completed or delivered and bribing military contractors, can be defined as just but he can not be blamed entirely for that given that those were the sign of the times. If anything, this investigation brought about a change in the way the aviation industry would be dealt with and Hughes' stern rebuttal of Brewster's true intentions single-handedly restored the idea of capitalism in yet another branch of the U.S. industrial system. <br /> <br />Not all the performances in The Aviator were necessarily as successful in their portrayal of the famous stars and starlets of the era as the last set of performers were, nor were some of the casting decisions. Jude Law, in what seems to be his twentieth appearance in a film - whether it be a mere cameo or an actual standing role - this year, gives a decent portrayal of Errol Flynn but one wonders why he is even in the film seeing as how he does little in the direct effect of Hughes' life or legend. Kate Beckingsale's role as Ava Gardner is not particularly unnecessary, nor can it exactly be described in such a negative way but there does appear to be some level of confusion as to how prominent of a role she actually played in Howard Hughes life and what she truly meant to him in the end. In the first couple of scenes we see her in, she seems as though she is nothing more then another Hollywood floozy coddling after the eccentric billionaire. This changes dramatically when later in the film she returns to see Howard in his retched condition alone in his office and cleans him up for his appearance in front of Brewster's public committee hearing, giving the sense as though she were mothering him a bit. Had more background information been provided on Miss Gardner or if Scorsese had gone more in-depth with their particular relationship together then there may not have been this sense of befuddlement the audience has concerning her particular character. One has to question why so much hype was built up by the entertainment industry press surrounding Gwen Stefani's portrayal as Jean Harlow. Her performance, if one can truly call it that, was quite disappointing, singling her out as nothing more then eye-candy and barely drawling out a pathetic one line of dialogue. <br /> <br />Overall, The Aviator, in much the same light as its subject of discussion, is larger then life itself and for what seems once in a blue moon on the screen that does not go aggressively against it, ensuring its rightful place as the film to beat this awards season. The film ends rather abruptly with Hughes standing directly in front of a grungy bathroom mirror, repeating the phrase \\"...wave of the future\\", and should the audience feel angered or disappointed by this conclusion then Martin Scorsese will have successfully pulled off his desired effect. True to form, the life of Howard Hughes' was never the same again from that moment on. For the mythic man who had done so much in his lifetime up to that point and at the same time had far more yet to accomplish, Hughes' condition spiraled out of control, reducing him to live in total obscurity in one of his several casinos in Las Vegas, dying of kidney failure. Far from the man who made the motion-picture no one wanted to release, wooed the finest women in Hollywood, and built and flew the largest plane in the world when no one believed it would even get a foot off the ground. That, ladies and gentlemen, is truly the disheartening conclusion to the eccentric, yet majestic, life of Mr. Howard Hughes. The man who perhaps was greatly overshadowed by the legendary figure he helped create and whose shoes he could not fill. Scorsese, a man always willing to be daring and take a risk when it comes to the exact look and feel of a particular film, brilliantly - how many times can that be said of him - captures in each year that is represented the accurate visual style of the color film of that time period, whether it was the old-fashioned Cinecolor or the two-strip Technicolor film. And as the story progresses, the film's appearance matures and fills out more, giving The Aviator a visual quality all its own, setting its miles apart from the competition. Undoubtedly this film will not be everyone's cup of tea, as disappointing as that may be to hear given as how apparently masterful it is, but rest assured that given the proper number of viewings and a through understanding of the life and time of the man who was Howard Hughes, it will be easy for anyone to see as to why this will be the film that gives Scorsese his absurdly overdue Academy Award this year.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|I have always considered this the greatest album of all time. First released in 1966, it is an astonishing collection of songs that transcend anything recorded before, and arguably after. Dylan dragged us, many kicking and screaming, to a new social awareness, far beyond politics or self interest. A flattening of the sixties \\"in\\" culture toward a much scarier world of personal responsibility and self reliance. In Dylan's eyes there was no one to trust except yourself. <br /> <br />From the familiar opening bars of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", to the mind uncluttering \\"Desolation Row\\", Dylan delivers knock out punches to every area of public trust. He was often criticized at the time for providing no answers. The real message was you are your only answer. Conformity breeds enslavement. <br /> <br />Most of these songs are at least semi-legendary by now. The importance, however is not in knowing the words but in finding a relevance, maybe different for each person, a virtual ink blot test of music & lyrics. Whether this was calculated by Dylan or arrived at by experiece, he knew his influences well and created an entirely new art form from them. They had their own priorities and our protection was low on their list.  <br /> <br /> Now certainly this is entirely from my perspective, but the idea that we are all entitled to our own interpretations is what makes Dylan such a revolutionary. Coming just a few years after the opening volleys of the cold war, it was just plain terrifying to many. The pillars of society were only dust in Dylan's eyes, and his opinion was informed. <br /> <br />The imagery is very dense here. I have found dissecting each line for meaning, at least initially, very frustrating. I have played this 500+ times in my life, I am 44, and still deepen my appreciation each time. I would certainly include \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", released just months later, in the same category. These recordings present wide open landscapes for the mind to explore. The point is tothink, not allow other people with their own issues, to make your decisions for you. <br /> <br />Viewing Dylan as a curiousity or personality totally misses the point. This is what he created and it speaks for itself.
B0007G89G4|4.0|For a movie that is nearly twenty years old, it's hard to find a decent story these days that deals with the nostalgia of growing up. The Story of \\"The Body\\" by Stephen King and its adaptation to film \\"Stand By Me\\" is a complete classic. It symbolization of youthful truth with its heartfelt honesty on childhood friendships still renders in the hearts of every viewer.   <br /> <br />\\"Stand By Me\\" tells the story of four young kids on an unforgetable journey to find the dead body of a young teenage boy named Ray Brauer. We experience the story through the eyes of young writer, Gordie. During the summer of 1959, his world is shakened by the horrible news of his brothers' passing. Abadnoned by his parents, he is left to find the comfort in his friendships, with problem child Chris, troublesome Teddy, and innocent Vern.  <br /> <br />One of the many reasons why this movie still resonates with audiences is probably from the direction of Rob Reiner and its magnificent casting. Especially in that of the late River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton. At times when some movies fail to capture the experiences of youth, \\"Stand By Me\\" never fails, and even allows the music to do some of the talking. It creates a world that we all remember on a journey we all/will experience. It's one of the many reasons it still brings in new audiences every year. <br /> <br />The Deluxe Eddition isn't bad. There is an eight song soundtrack that comes with the set, along with the booklet that tells of the making of the story. There is even a 40 minute video in the special feature section that is quite enjoyable. However, there aren't any trailers from the orginal release of the movie that seemed disapointng. The audio isn't bad and is even adapted for high defintion.            <br /> <br />\\"Stand By Me\\" stands as one of Stephen King's finest writings. It will stay there for a long while, too. It's the perfect coming of age story where life is a journey of redemption and self-discovery.  <br />
B00005JNTV|5.0|Rest assured, \\"Sin City\\" is like no other film you have ever seen.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\", directed by Robert Rodriguez (\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" and \\"Spy Kids\\") and Frank Miller (the creator of the graphic novels the film is based on) tells a number of stories, which share characters and themes. A cop with a bad heart (Bruce Willis) attempts to save an eleven year old girl, Nancy, from the sadistic killer, Junior (Nick Stahl). Marv (Mickey Rourke), a gangster, trawls the streets looking for the person who killed the hooker he slept with last night. Another gangster (Clive Owen) leads the abusive ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) into Old Town, an area run by hookers.<br /><br />Each of these stories pays homage to Film Noir, a type of filmmaking prevalent in the late 40s and early 50s. Every so often a filmmaker will take a stab at recreating the genre, with mixed results. Rodriguez appears to have been inspired by the source material, because this is not only one of his best films, but also one of the best modern takes on Noir. \\"City\\" has all of the trademarks of classic Noir; black and white cinematography, heroes and heroines trying to live in a corrupt society, villains trying to maintain control and desperate, desperate people.<br /><br />Like much of the \\"Spy Kids\\" films, Rodriguez shot most of \\"City\\" in front of a blue screen. Basically, he filmed the actors in front of a blank wall and added the backgrounds and special effects later. Many films use this technique for part of the process, but \\"City\\" appears to have been made using primarily this process. Almost all of the film is shot in black and white. This might be problematic for some, but I completely forgot about the lack of color, until he used brief glimpses of color. The backgrounds are richly detailed in shades of black, white and gray. They also appear to be consistent, helping to create a believable world. Because I believed in the setting of the film, I didn't miss the color. Color is used as a punctuation point. In some scenes, the red of blood appears, in others, the gold of a woman's hair. This creates a unique, interesting visual style, which appears to be inspired by the source material. Rodriguez also moves the camera to replicate graphic novel angels, making us believe that we are in a living comic book. Normally, all of these `tricks' would serve to draw the viewer out of the story and universe. In \\"City\\", it all serves to draw us in.<br /><br />The unique visual style is only the first element necessary to make us believe. The second, and perhaps most crucial element, are the actors. Frequently, in a movie based on comic books or similar material, all of the work is put into the visual. The actors walk through the story, spouting their lines. In \\"City\\", every one of the actors, and there are many, portray their characters in a serious way, as though they were in a run of the mill crime drama. No one lets on to the fact that they are basically in a live action graphic novel. Because they believe, this helps us believe, adding further to the creation of \\"Sin City\\" as a `real place'. It is difficult to say there is a lead in the film, but Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba all take on meatier roles in the interconnecting stories. They are joined by Elijah Wood, Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Josh Hartnett, Michael Madsen and a collection of young starlets. In any film with different stories, and this many actors, each person needs to make an impact and make one fast or they get lost in the shuffle. A lot of this has to do with how central the character is to the story; if they have a lot to do, they will be on screen more. Also, in Noir, the stories are usually accompanied by voice over narration from the lead character. In each of the stories, the main characters provide voice over, giving us insight into their thoughts. Hartigan, played by Willis, is steely, determined and effective. Marv, played by Rourke, whose plastic surgery is covered with enough make-up to make him resemble a Dick Tracy character, embarks on a memorable journey. Owen and Del Toro are also effective as they battle each other in Old Town, with the help of a number of very deadly hookers. All of these actors do a great job of helping to make \\"Sin City\\" all the more engaging.<br /><br />The interconnecting stories will probably bring \\"Pulp Fiction\\" to mind for many. When a major star appears in the first five minutes of the film, you get the feeling that their character will return at another point, probably the finale. The interconnecting stories share timelines and characters, creating a larger more interesting portrait. I find it interesting to watch a filmmaker's career and trace the `ancestry' of their films. In \\"Sin City\\", Rodriguez uses the digital technology that he used effectively in the \\"Spy Kids\\" trilogy, but takes it to another degree. He combines this with the sort of violent story that he has told well in previous films like \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" and \\"Once Upon A Time In Mexico\\".<br /><br />\\"City\\" is hard-boiled Noir. As I mentioned, color is used sporadically throughout. There is a lot of violence and, thankfully, Rodriguez only occasionally shows the blood in color. More often it appears as a milky white. He uses red as a punctuation point, drawing our attention to the actors or action; occasionally, red appears in a pool of blood, or in a person's shoes, or in a hooker's dress. This doesn't diminish the effect of the violence, it enhances it. Nudity also has a place in Sin City and it is the most gratuitous element of the film. Somehow, this is also fitting. You would expect nudity to be fairly common place in a town known for its sin.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is one of the most visually interesting and challenging films I have seen in a long time.

B0007MVXQG|1.0|While the actual Judas Priest CD, Angel of Retribution, is an absolutely fantastic blend of basic rock and heavy metal,I am completely disappointed with the Dual Disc format.  The disc did not fit well into my 6-changer CD player in my car (unlike any other CD I have ever purchased).  In fact the Dual Disc is too thick to fit into many CD players due to the disc containing formatting on both sides.  Thus, to remove the disc from the changer, I completely scratched the CD side.  At the end of the day, I have paid hard-earned money for a brand new SCRATCHED disc than I cannot play nor hear.
B000000H5J|5.0|What can be said about this band that hasn't been said. That they were totally original? That they mixed extreme and industrial metal so seamlessly? That Burton's dual vocal style would be imitated for years to come? Revolutionary is definetly a word that comes to mind when I think of this masterpiece.<br /><br />Fear Factory actually started out as a Death Metal band and evolved into the perfect mix of death and industrial metal on this album. From Dino's razor sharp and heavy riffs, playing in perfect synchronization with Raymond's amazing double bass, to the highlight of the album, for me...Burton's vocals. He has an amazing singing voice and although it would have been nice to hear a more death metal like growl to go along with his clean singing, as on Soul of a New Machine, the extreme vocal side he does use fits quite well here.<br /><br />Seeing as how this was one of the albums that made me a metal fan, it's impossible for me not to praise this album.<br /><br />Welcome to the world of Fear Factory!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I am an American who studied abroad in college in Germany.  This move captures that year perfectly! <br />If you studied abroad, this will bring back all the fond memories.  If you haven't and you want to know what it is like, this movie is for you.   <br />Otherwise it's a fairly entertaining movie, but it's ability to accurately portray the life and youthful innocence of going overseas is what makes the movie standout.(i.e. they use the actual languages of each person and just put the subtitles in English, when english isn't being spoken.)
B0000931QA|5.0|Operation: Mindcrime is the album by which Queensryche is known throughout the world; people who know little or nothing about the band have at least heard of them because of this record. It is perhaps the most revolutionary prog metal album because of its compelling storyline and masterfully-crafted musicianship. While Fates Warning already started to pave the way for their followers with Awaken the Guardian in 1986, it was mainly Queensryche that managed to break on a bigger scale reaching the masses. This album set the standards for most of the 90's bands; anyone who listens to Heavy Metal holds it very high respecting every second of it.<br /><br />Where to begin? I know it's daft trying to explain the storyline of a deeply moving concept 16 years after its inception, especially if only few of the question marks have been erased since 1988. Basically, Operation: Mindcrime is an epic tale of revolution and intrigue, psychological manipulation, corruption of politicians, media, drugs, murder and suicide. It envelopes a broad range of subject matters dealing with them from individuals' point of view, but on a larger scope, it also offers sociopolitical commentary on the previously mentioned themes. Geoff Tate came up with this incredibly profound concept when he was living in Montreal after the Rage for Order tour. He mentioned he was flooded with an abundance of lyrical ideas while sitting in the back of a Catholic Church with a choir singing in full voice around flickering candles lightening the gloomy atmosphere of the place. The foundations of the storyline came to him in a flash and he mentioned writing most of the story within a span of twenty minutes. He broadened his scope by coupling the interesting tale with different personalities he'd met on his travels. One of these characters became Doctor X, a man with cold, calculating and vicious personality whose alleged involvement with a terrorist organization was the inspiration for this record.<br /><br />Of course it's not just about the music. When Tate presented his idea of a concept piece to the band, the only member who embraced the offer was his principal writing partner Chris DeGarmo. Had it not been for DeGarmo's bold move and creative input this disc would have never been what it is. Besides Geoff Tate's cerebral lyrical work and amazing vocal delivery, it is Chris DeGarmo's esoteric songwriting what makes O:M a timeless masterpiece. While he isn't credited as a composer in tracks such as \\"Speak\\" and \\"Revolution Calling\\", I would bet my life that those tracks were all given their final touch by DeGarmo and noted producer Nick Collins of Rush fame. The album shines from start to finish peaking particularly with the lyrics of \\"Revolution Calling\\" introducing the storyline and \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" delivering the message of the entire record successfully. \\"The Mission\\" being one of the many 100% Chris DeGarmo creations sees Geoff Tate performing a rock solid vocal performance backed up by powerful melodies. \\"Spreading the Disease\\" once again displays Geoff Tate's amazing talents as a lyricist while the 10-minute epic \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" sees the entire band performing with incredible chemistry and conviction. Of all songs this one has the most unconventional song structure with Tate's vocal melodies taking you to heights where you might want to freeze forever.<br /><br />\\"Eyes of a Stranger\\" is/was not only the major hit of the record getting good airplay from MTV, but it is also the culmination of the O:M story. While the video displays the many facets of the story, the song lyrically gives a rundown of the concept edging back on the heaviness but never sacrificing the integrity of the album. I stopped being a Queensryche fan after their 1994 release Promised Land as their new musical direction seemed to betray their roots; therefore I can't say I am too excited about the sequel of the Mindcrime story. Honestly it all seems to me as a new way to cash in on the money. What Tate and Wilton forget, however, is you can't create the same magic by just naming your record O:M 2 even if you get the exact same line-up. It's about what DeGarmo really feels and how much he honestly puts in the record and let's face it there no longer is a fire in DeGarmo that would prompt him to write another masterpiece of this calibre. Why don't we just cherish what we have and keep listening to the original Mindcrime record?n the money.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I am always looking for something new to listen to. I actally first heard the song named The Blower's Daughter from the movie Closer. Then I looked up Damien Rice's cds and found 0 and bought it. I love this cd. His music is so soft and beautiful. I think you will love this cd if you are really open to new music. GREAT CD!!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|There is not a single Dream Theater album that sounds like its predecessor. Awake was nothing like their phenomenal album Images & Words; and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was a total paradigm shift after Scenes From A Memory. Thus, whether you like Dream Theater's musical direction or not, they do continue to evolve and progress -- and Train of Thought sounds as unique as anything else in their amazing back catalog. It sure has stirred much controversy, but at the end of the day, the album definitely serves its purpose. John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy had been greatly experimenting with heavier songs on their Six Degrees tour, and the heaviness factor was something they certainly had to get out of their system, which I'm glad they did.<br /><br />I've listened to this album a million times, and after almost two years, it still stands out as a solid and heavy progressive release. John Myung on bass leaves his imprint on pretty much each song here, making his sound audible like never before. It is great to hear him dominating tunes such as \\"Honor Thy Father\\" and \\"Vacant\\". He even plays solos on the instrumental piece \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" -- twice! Another major difference is that Jordan Rudess on keys perhaps takes a secondary role through the album; he is almost nonexistent on the thrash-riff laden \\"As I Am\\" which holds a lot of classic Metallica references. Rudess is still there, however -- just in a different capacity. He adds some nice piano melodies that are vital to the songs. His piano piece on \\"This Dying Soul\\" is almost dream-like, while he cuts loose playing a hypnotic hammond solo on \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" where his sound keeps panning from the right speaker to the left and it's majestic to say the least. Rudess also co-wrote the only soft song, \\"Vacant\\", with Myung, to which James Labrie contributed lyrics, and this track forms a nice bridge between the first set of heavier songs and the more epic-length proggy numbers.<br /><br />Without doubt, John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy are the backbones of the songs. Petrucci plays long, detailed guitar solos that may come off as less melodic than usual, but that doesn't mean he plays all shred only. Note the ending of the instrumental song, study Petrucci's flowing melody line and how he mixes it with DiMeola-ish playing. The song is basically centred around Myung's scary bass figure with interesting Beatles-like harmonies and occasional fusion textures. Petrucci also adds a nice guitar riff with Egyptian scales before he delves into chunking metal riffage -- perhaps the heaviest thing ever played on a DT album. I believe the instrumental outro of this song might leave most Spastic Ink fans pleased. Mike Portnoy's drumming is tasteful. His tone is solid and blisters with power. He plays brilliantly leaving his mark and giving the album its immediate Dream Theater character.<br /><br />Aside from the lyrics to one song, Labrie isn't given much creative input on the album. Yet, he still does all the songs justice, be it the amazing chorus on \\"Endless Sacrifice\\", the vocal melody at the end of the 14-minute track \\"In the Name of the God\\" or simply the stunning ballad \\"Vacant\\". Some people bash DT for turning too mainstream on TOT; well, you can't be aiming the mainstream audience when five out of seven songs on your album span over 10 minutes, with impossibly technical instrumental prowess and cerebral lyrics. You can argue every aspect of DT's music, you can love or hate their instrumentation, song arrangements, but you cannot deny that even their most averagely written song lyrics are lightyears more thought-provoking and poignant than pretty much every other prog band out there. Train of Thought sees Petrucci and Portnoy exploring themes of independence, alcohol problems and recovery, religion, resistance and spiritualism. Dream Theater simply continues to evolve, while most others simply walk in their footsteps.hn Petrucci and Mike Portnoy are the backbones of the songs.

B00003CXCT|3.0|I recently viewed the new 2004 Star Wars Trilogy on DVD Box Set. <br />The Star Wars I grew up with and loved is no more. The DVD's are simply another money making vehicle for Mr. Lucas. 'A New Hope', which use to be first, but is now fourth, has been enhanced even more since the 1997 re-release. The old and the new special effects don't work well together. It is cheesy. 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' are really good. The special effects work well in the fifth? and sixth? installment. <br />But, the very end of 'Return of the Jedi', when Luke witnesses the spirits of Obe-wan, Yoda, and Anakin, Luke sees Alec Guiness, The Yoda puppet, and...  Hayden Christiansen. After seeing that, I became disgusted. It should have been the old Anakin Skywalker standing with the old Yoda and old Obe-wan. <br />The trilogy has no more meaning to it. You can't make a re-re-release too perfect without giving up something.
B00000I07P|5.0|So what if this album is more \\"pop\\" in it's sound than other metal? You can sing along and still jam and rock out like hell to it, and to me, that's what matters in a song. Does it have a beat and a melody that you can move to? Does it have power to get you to sing? Can you understand the lyrics? Does it have variety? All these get a resounding yes from this critic. \\"Slippery when wet\\" is the typical metal CD of the 1980's, and that isn't a bad thing. <br /> <br />For those who for some reason hate bands like this one and Def Leppard (another one I think is alright) to death, stop reading this review and move on. For the others, this CD I think is great. It has it's hard rock songs in \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" and \\"Livin' On a Prayer\\". It's also got the awesome love song in \\"Never Say Goodbye\\". This is the album you still hear at the bars today, and let me tell you something: there is nothing like belting out \\"living on a prayer\\" after a few drinks. That is why I think this is a good CD: it has a good melody, rocks hard, you can sing along, and understand the words. Plus the album has plenty of variety. For me, that is the way I judge a good album. <br /> <br />If you want metal where it's thrashing guitars, screaming lyrics that are hard to understand and a melody that is hard to understand, then don't check out \\"Slippery When Wet\\". However, if you are looking for something that you can sing along too and still rock out and, by gosh, dance to, this is your album.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was just so capativated by this movie and I've been scratching my head for months since I saw it for the first time trying to understand it. The reviews here have helped a lot. I think this movie is about how you need to see things in two ways like both matter and spirit. Some of the reviews including Hollywood Jesus show how its about overcoming dualities. I see this movie both for its face value and the hidden interior too now.
0805076476|5.0|When I first read the book I wondered how close it would be to the movie.  At first they are almost identical, but they diverge into very different stories.  The novel actually has a love story subplot in it and the endings are completely different.  It offers an interesting perspective on modern society; instead of reaching the top Tyler Durden preaches hitting rock bottom.  Instead of achieving the American Dream Tyler suggests destroying it.  The new version of the novel offers an introduction by Chuck Palahniuk that shows just how influential the book and movie have been.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed A Clockwork Orange or to anyone interested in reading an interesting commentary on society.  Do not just read the book and do not just see the movie; do both.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones has a beautiful, airy voice.  Her voice resonates like the sounds in a smoky night club.  When I first heard her, I thought she sounded very much like Rickie Lee Jones, although their choice of music is very different.  While Rickie Lee Jones has released many more CDs than Norah Jones, Norah Jones has been able to make fewer mistakes in her choice of music and in her rendition of songs.  What also makes this CD enjoyable is that the recording is engineered very well, and the songs have great imaging.  My only complaint about this CD is that some of the songs sound too similar.
1401300901|5.0|This book was so beautifully writeen, and so spot on in every way, that it is hard for me to believe that Cecelia Ahern was only 21 years old when she wrote it. It's romantic, entertaining, and tragic all at once. The emotional scope of the book kept it ALIVE! I laughed out loud, I cried real tears, and I truly enjoyed every singel page from start to finish! It's a definite must read for any romantic!
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I saw this movie with a friend of mine the other night and I have to admit I was really looking forward to it.  I was told that it was a bit gory but it had a good plot and the ending was good as well.  WRONG!!! <br /> <br />This movie had poor acting as well as a very dark plot.  There is nothing happy or satisfying in this movie.  In the end, you feel very cheated and wish you had the last 100 minutes of your life back.  If you are looking for a good thriller, do not see saw!
1400043662|5.0|Wow.  A book that sometimes reads like a soulful Coltrane riff, sometimes like the sexy stuff of Prince, and sometimes like Beethoven at his moody, genius best,  The novel, part science fiction, part love story, part coming of age, part mystery, is one to take as it comes, sometimes slowly and sometimes faster than breath.  Murakami tells the  mysterious story of Kafka \\"the toughest fifteen year old in the world,\\" who is running from his father's Oedipal curse.  The story of Nakata, a kindly, illiterate older man is enterwined with and balances the mood of Kafka's tale.  Nakata,who speaks to cats and can cause natural disasters is joined in the story by Hoshino, a young truck driver compelled to help Nakata at any cost.  This is a sometimes manic, moody and mindful exploration of the possibility of labyrinthine Time loops where people can be thrust into outcomes other than what is meant to be.  Nakata and the director of the library, the lovely Miss Saeki, are two people whose lives were affected by such an experience. Both have suffered great losses as a consequence, and both have very weak shadows, which in Murakami's stories define people who have lost their memories, the part of themselves connected to this life.  Murakami explores metaphors considered in his other works to new effect.  The library is repository of memory.  The forest is a place of contentment in being completely oneself.  Love and how we do or do not live it define the people of Kafka on the Shore.  Sex and gender are well considered themes.  Oshima, the library assistant who becomes a friend to Kafka gives insight to Aristophones and the concept of the beloved as ones's other half - male/male, female/female, or male/female -  \\"how we stumble through our life desperately fumbling for our other half.\\"  Most readers will sympathise and delight in Kafka's first sexual experiences  and mind blowing, as well as heart breaking first love. Murakami creates nuanced minor characters, including talking cats, who move the story toward the climax and often give philosophical substance to their encounters with the main cast.  There is one notable hooker who combines the philosophy of Henri Bergson (quoted in my title) with Hegel's thoughts, \\"At the same time \\"I\\" am the content of a relation, \\"I\\" am also that which does the relating,\\" and sex takes on a mind boggling tantric twist for Hoshino's enlightenment and pleasure. Kafka and the others in this story explore what it means to be a truly free human, how we mostly trap ourselves into mindsets and habits that do not support loving kindness to ourselves as well as others, and how by actually giving ourselves over to what is needed and what we can do about it, we become untrapped, never bored, and in love with our time of life.  This is one of the books I will pick up to read again in part and in total, because I think it speaks to all ages, and it does so with humor, warmth, intelligence and love for the everyman.
0440238609|5.0|It has been almost 5 months since I have read this trilogy and since I have read 10 or more books, but when I think of what I've read these books always stick out. I find myself thinking about them almost everyday and this absolutely wonderful tale of a pair of adolescents adventure through different worlds. These books are truly wonderful and I'd reccomend them to anyone. They kept me guessing throughout and had me jumping in bed at the twists. The Amber Spyglass was and still is the only book that has ever made me cry. These books are truly magnificent.
0060763280|5.0|T. Harv Eker writes an extremely easy to read book filled with excellent advice.  He tells it straight and from the heart.  It is so full of great information that it would not be possible to absorb it all in one reading. And if you underline or highlight the great passages, you will have more text underlined or highlighted than left as is.  It is great reading.<br /><br />If you really want to change your financial situation, read the book - then read it again - then make up your mind to do what Harv teaches.  You will not be disappointed.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Before I say anything else, you guys are very poor at keeping up with rumors. Lucas is releasing a boxset of all six films on HD-DVD for the 30th anniversary. He is releasing a standard set (with more alterations, mainly touch-up work from what I hear), and another set containing THE ORIGINALS. He simply did not have the time this go around. It took him a year just to re-master the films to DVD format. Don't cite an interview with him claiming that he won't release the originals, because Lucas is very good at doing what he says he won't do: <br />\\"Phantom Menace won't be on DVD until 2004\\" <br />\\"I won't release the original triliogy on DVD until 2007\\" <br />\\"I won't create another Star Wars movie after Episode III\\" <br />Yet, he leaked some Episode 7-9 info recently, as if to hype these movies that he \\"will never release.\\" Hmmm... <br /> <br />Just to name a few. Give the poor man some time, and you will get your movies IN HIGH DEFINITION. Be patient. <br /> <br />For the most part, the changes enhance the story, and push it beyond what it originally was. The only changes that damaged the story line were Boba Fett's voice dubbing, and Hayden's cameo, both were poorly done. I was going to give this set four stars for those two reasons, but after seeing what cry-babys have reviewed this set, I decided to give these films the stars they deserve. Plus, those two alteration were very MINOR issues. <br /> <br />Face it: if Lucas didn't exist, you all would never have seen Star Wars in the first place. You are all complaining about something he gave you. It's his property, let him do what he wants with it. He puts millions of his own money into his films to ensure it is a quality product. Lucas has high standards for what he puts out. <br /> <br />Bottom line: find something else to do until 2007. I'm going to chuckle quite loudly when you all start singing praises to him when he panders out the originals. It may seem like a long time, but trust me, seeing the movies justas you remember them in HD format will be worth the wait.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Watching this concert left me speechless - it really blew me away. Being a life-long fan of the fab-four, I mourned the passing away of George. This concert showed me how much George  is loved - the Royal Albert Hall was jam-packed to the brim. EC,Billy Preston,Jeff Lynne,Ray Cooper,Tom Petty+Heartbreakers,Paul and Ringo and others all come together to honour the great music of a dear friend and extremely talented fellow musician and artist. I couldn't get over how much Dhani resembles his father, and I couldn't fight back the tears when the camera angle captured Paul,Ringo and Dhani together in the same frame (if only Julian had been there on stage...). I highly recommend this DVD to any Beatle fan especially to those who loved George.
B00005R24K|5.0|Groundbreaking,original,super artistic,ballzy,smart,VERY SCARY!a genuine(blue-print)horror movie! In my opinion this is truely without a dought 1 of the top 20 greatest horror films of all time! Director Sam Raimi's debut is a masterpiece.
B000002UB3|5.0|Note to younger fans: Yes, I realize \\"Abbey Road\\" came out in 1969 and \\"Let it Be\\" didn't come out until 1970, but that material was actually recorded before \\"Abbey Road\\" and abandoned...along with the companion film..because of group infighting. Somehow, the Fabs agreed to give George Martin control and try to pull together one last time and this was the crystalline result.<br /><br />Highlights are hard to choose from the great tunes here, but I'd say John's \\"Come Together\\", Paul's \\"Golden Slumbers\\", and George's \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" fill the bill. The other 'highlight' isn't a single song..it's the suite of John and Paul's never finished song fragments that comprise Side Two. Somehow everything between \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" and \\"Her Majesty\\" (which appeared because of a mastering mistake) just sound RIGHT. If ever there were a more appropriate use of the phrase \\"happy accident\\", I'm not sure what it could be. Separately, none of them is really that good (save \\"Golden Slumbers\\") but mushed together it just glows. Add to that one of Ringo's best vocals on \\"Octopus' Garden\\" and you've got a classic.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This just narrowly misses being my favourite Beatles album...mostly because I think some of the songs here are \\"good\\" (Oh! Darling,I Want You (She's So Heavy)) rather than \\"great\\". But the best bits are good enough to make this an undeniable classic and very nearly the most listenable Beatles album in the catalogue. Every rock listener should own this.
0380789035|2.0|i don't understand the praise for this book.<br /><br />for starters, with the word \\"Gods\\" in the title, you would expect all sorts of crazy fantastical things happening. but no, NOTHING happens! the entire middle 200 pages the main character (Shadow) hangs out in a small town and does nothing. if you like reading about the items someone buys at a small town grocery store, then this book is right up your alley. things start kicking in towards the end of the book, but by then i didn't care.<br /><br />the gods were unimaginatively rendered. the \\"internet\\" is a fat pimply kid who doesn't do anything but drive around in a limo for christ's sake! what does that have to do with the internet???? what amazingly cool things you could come up with personifying the internet as a god, and this is what we get?<br /><br />gaimen basically just throws in every god reference he can but really doesn't have a whole lot to say about anything. old gods versus new gods, the world is changing, blah blah blah. there's so many profound things that could be said in this book, but gaimen resorts to tired cliches.<br /><br />gaimen has no sense of characterization. there aren't really characters here. just people saying things to further the non-plot. gaimen relies on exposition to describe a character's personality instead of having the personality come through in what the character says. there's no passion from anyone.<br /><br />i really hated this book. gaimen just rips things from mythology and american culture/landscape, throws it all together with nothing really to say of his own and a mishmash plot, and everyone thinks it's amazing! argh!
B00009RAJJ|3.0|This came after the band's hugest chart (and critical) success: \\"Rumours\\". The band spent tons of money, and a lot of time in the studio, working to move their sound into a new direction, rather than just making \\"Rumours 2\\". While it kept them from becoming stale, it stalled them on the charts and was only somewhat successful artistically.<br /><br />It seems that most Fleetwood Mac fans fall into camps: Stevie, Lindsay, Christine, Peter Green years. I'm the rare animal that sees some merit in all phases of the band and in each of the \\"big four\\" songwriters.<br /><br />This project is obviously Lindsay's baby as he performs lead on 9 of the album's 20 tracks (compared to Stevie's 5 and Christine's 6) and handled the production. As usual with double albums, they result from not enough diligence in being selective about what makes the cut. Unlike most reviewers, I tend to think Lindsay's songs here acquit themselves best.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />The first really good tune here is Christine's \\"Think About Me\\", probably the most akin to the peppy pop you usually expect from her. Outside of that one, her other highlight here is the short but delicious \\"Never Make Me Cry\\". Stevie comes up with the biggest hit here in \\"Sara\\" (but it's EDITED from the album version) and it deserved the chart splash. Despite my usual distaste for her \\"witchy woman\\" aura, \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" also turns up as one of the highlights along with the tender coming of age \\"Beautiful Child\\". Lindsay comes up with some nifty angry edgy rockers in \\"Not that Funny\\" and \\"What Makes you Think You're the One?\\" as well as graceful ballads \\"Save Me a Place\\" and \\"Walk a Thin Line\\". Those who believe we should \\"give the drummer some!\\" will love the bristling percussion on the title track (with help from the USC Marching Band).<br /><br />LOWS:<br />Christine seems stickily sentimental and uninspired here. \\"Over and Over\\", \\"Honey Hi\\" and \\"Never Forget\\" just don't linger in your memory. Lindsay's sole clunker is \\"That's Enough for Me\\" which just seems like a recycle of \\"Not that Funny\\" musically. \\"Brown Eyes\\" isn't awful, but it's way too long. At 3 1/2 minutes, it would be a nicely slinky album track, but at 4 1/2 minutes it's just boring. Wake me when it's over.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This is NOT for casual Mac fans. There's too much experimentalism for those who like the pop side of the band and<br />too few uptempo catchy ditties (a la \\"Don't Stop\\" or \\"Second Hand News\\"). The tone is decidedly muted, somewhat somber. There ARE some gems here, but a lot of dross, too.<br /><br />If you ARE a bigger fan, and other reviewers' complaints about the edit of \\"Sara\\" and sound quality are keeping you away, get the 2CD remaster instead.<br /><br />'Radio songs' fans can get \\"Sara\\" and \\"Tusk\\" on the \\"Greatest Hits\\".seems like a recycle of \\"Not that Funny\\" musically. \\"Brown Eyes\\" isn't awful, but it's way too long.

0142002038|2.0|It would be easy to rubbish this book. Even Fleming fans draw back from it a little because it is not really one of the series. It stands apart to some extent as a kind of old fashioned adventure story. It is easy to see why it was chosen to be the first to be filmed rather than Casino Royale - the first in the series. Before `The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" they were doubtful of the appeal of a spy story to a mass cinema audience and hedged their bets by filming the one they felt to be most `mainstream' Once they had picked Dr No the film makers threw away the order of the books and the character development that runs through the series from the vulnerability Bond displayed at the beginning to his nearly total disintegration near the end. The impossibility of the series - that Bond could actually have survived so long when he was a bordering 40 bungler with a fatal flaw in the libido department - is also sidestepped by the films making him out to be a totally different character; a superhero with an impressive range of skills and gadgets that always work! The films are impossible for a different reason; in an age of information technology and universal surveillance with information a saleable commodity Bond would only have lasted as long as one assignment before his cover was well and truly blown and he was reduced to appearances on Jerry Springer to supplement his Government Pension. Had the Bond of the books been real he would have been routinely shot by a hired hitman using a telescopic gun sight and nothing more technically advanced than that!<br /><br /> I have picked Dr No, because it is widely regarded as untypical and yet it was the first I read - although I read it before seeing the film. I found the prose stark and simple. Fleming's habit of saying `Bond said' at every utterance reminded me of Janet and John books. But I was captivated by some of his description that seemed to me - at the age of 13 - to be striking and original. I loved the idea of themonth of March coming in `like a rattlesnake' or a steel band sounding like `a giant spider dancing on a xylophone' and I was more forgiving then of some of the excesses. Yet I found his stereotyping of Jamaican Quarrel ridiculous \\"Quick Boss! Dey's a commin'!\\" - surely it must have been offensive! I was quick to notice that it was not carried over into the film. Although I had  uncomfortable moments when I thought the camera pointed up one or two visual gags - on Quarrel's facial expression at seeing a crab pass close by his face for example. Fleming lays this kind of thing with a trowel. Generally the writing is not just competent, it is stylishly compelling. Fleming is easy to read compared, for example to Stephen King. Fleming is the ideal airport author because Bond books are not that long and you can get well into them before your flight is over - perhaps even finish them on a long transatlantic flight; something that must have contributed to the sales. Fleming is undemanding. And he does make one want to know what is going to happen. His characterisation is spartan but this may be a strength in this kind of fiction as male readers will want Bond to be as lightly drawn as possible so that they can easily identify with him while female readers will have their own idea of what Bond looks like.<br /><br />As for the women - it is possibly not entirely fair to dismiss them as fantasy figures!<br /><br />I must admit that when I read Dr No for the first time I found Honeychild Rider an interesting role model! The idea of ducking out of school to live by myself in a ruined house, educating myself with an encyclopaedia and assassinating the local sex pests with black widow spiders appealed to my Gothic sensibilities! Had I written the book I would just have given Honey more to do! She obviously had plenty of spirit and was street wise, athletic and should have been pretty good in the jungle warfare department too I would have thought! She is potentially such a goodfemale adventure heroine that it is a disappointment that once Bond turns up her own story is put on hold - so to speak. Of course we might miss this on first reading because we have not seen things from her point of view. But on second reading it becomes a considerable weakness because when she appears we think \\"Oh yes! She's the woman with the black widow spider and the tough upbringing who goes diving for shells and - wait a minute! Hey! When do we get to see some of that?\\" By the end of the book she is reduced to polishing the family silver and cooking Bond's supper! By the next book Bond has thrown her over. Her life is ended as far as the reader is concerned. She is relegated to a footnote in Bond's endlessly repeating cycle of `kiss kiss bang bang' as it has been felicitously described.<br /><br /> In fact Honey is not a typical `Bond Woman' for another reason. She has no relevance to the plot. She is not a `McGuffin' - which the others tend to be. She is not the villain's mistress or the victim of the villain's machinations. She just wanders on, titillates and vanishes. Even the bit of hokum about her sailing up to the beach without lowering her sail and thus showing up on Dr No's radar is only the slightest excuse. She is not even with Bond very much except as window dressing and she might be dead for all we know. Dr No has her tied down in the path of the dreaded killer crabs - and she knows enough about crabs to just go to sleep until they have crawled over her. This book's obsession with wildlife as a matter of execution is another unusual feature. Besides the crab and the black widow; Bond is nearly stung to death by a centipede and almost eaten by a giant squid and Dr No is finally despatched under a pile of seagull droppings. Bond has to crawl through a cage of deadly spiders and then there is the swamp where all three adventurers risk being nibbled to death by all manner of insects and leeches.<br /><br /> The name `Honey' seems to indicate Fleming'swish to sweeten a bitter pill. He does tend to dwell on the dirty and unsavoury in this story. There is an interesting sidelight that one of his associates cast on this in that when at a beach party a woman he was interested in went behind a rock to urinate Fleming was so shocked that he shunned her from then on! Could this novel - and some of his other literary excesses be an attempted move into cathartic anti-script? There is also the detail of Honey's broken nose. I found it hard to believe that a doctor could not have set it better than he did. Then there is her ambition to make enough money so that she can get her nose fixed and become a `call-girl'. This seems to be Fleming's logic - not hers. Why could she not want to study oceanography or become a tour guide or go into business for herself? The casual way this career idea is introduced does not stand up to examination. Here is a woman who was raped and felt so violated that she took her revenge by murdering her  attacker - who also broke her nose when she tried to resist him! It makes no sense and ignores the deeper damage that rape victims feel that she thinks that all she needs to do is fix the physical damage that the man had done to her and then happily take her place as a willing participant in the institutionalised rape she will find in the sex industry! People do make irrational decisions, but this is too casual. It would have been ironic and worth exploring in a story where a woman indeed went down that route. This, however, implies that it was a conscious choice made out of childhood innocence - and of course sets Bond up as the man who rescues her from her own folly. The book is full of such cringe-worthy moments as this.<br /><br />The English novelist Kingsly Amis, in his improbably apologetic critique of his hero fails to see why Fleming really did not like women. He points to the affectionate little asides that pepper Fleming's description as if these somehow makes it alright to portray womenin such a shallow way. It is fairly obvious that Fleming painted himself into a corner by not giving Bond a female sidekick when he sends him off to his `mysterious island' so he washes one up on to the beach like a piece of driftwood! Then he has to get rid of Quarrel so he has him wiped out by a flamethrower! This is what makes Dr No the most sexless of all the books. It is also perhaps the most revealing. There is an old tradition of this kind of fiction where the characters were exclusively male and the females were merely incidental. Was Fleming perhaps letting us know that he would rather not include women at all?
B000001EGE|4.0|The songs turn more commercial here and it payed off for Elton with a U.S. #1 album for the first time. The artistic results are middling...some fantastic peaks along with mediocre numbers.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"Rocket Man\\" is probably the most aired track off here and it deserves it. Despite its astronaut protagonist, it's easy to make it universal by viewing it as the expression of any businessman who has to travel far away from his family...or a veiled metaphor for Elton's own life on the road. \\"Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids\\" is one of the best lines Taupin's penned. \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" is the other Elton classic found here...an unflinching portrait of big city apathy. Couple this with big hit \\"Honky Cat\\" ('better get back, honky cat, living in the city ain't where it's at') and the rustic TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION album and it seems pretty clear Bernie's just not an urban kind of guy. The teen drama of \\"Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\" is perfect, though I'm amazed how many here don't seem to get that the song is upbeat because the teen in question is giddy with the prospect of watching those who aren't letting him set his own curfew bathe in guilt after he offs himself. It's not because Elton or Bernie think suicide's a wonderful thing...\\"Amy\\" is more teen angst, this time because the object of his affections thinks Elton's too young. Electric violin from fusion giant Jean-Luc Ponty is a nice touch. \\"Slave\\" is Bernie indulging in a historical topic and turning in a pretty convincing look through the eyes of those forced to labour on Southern plantations.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />Nothing is outright awful, but \\"Mellow\\" is a pretty flaccid tune. Faux gospel number \\"Salvation\\" doesn't connect as well as later effort \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" did. The alternate take of \\"Slave\\" was wisely re-tooled. As the liners note, it loses its power in the frenetic uptempo version here.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Making a chart play means the music is catchier but sometimes there's not as much depth lyrically here although I don't know if it's intentional or just that Bernie's batch wasn't as strong this time. While part of Elton's \\"golden period\\", it's not as strong as others that surrounded it.<br /><br />3 1/2 starss not as much depth lyrically here although I don't know if it's intentional or just that Bernie's batch wasn't as strong this time.

0060934719|3.0|Tristran Thornton was born in Faerie but raised in Wall, England. He returns to the land of his birth by walking through a guarded opening in the wall of his city. In Faerie, he seeks to retrieve a fallen star and bring it home to his love because she said she'd consent to marry him if he did so. He finds the fallen star vastly different from what he imagined. Nevertheless, his quest is to bring the fallen star to his love back home and this is what he is determined to do.<br /><br />Stardust reads like a fairy tale for grownups with some of Neil Gaiman's humor thrown in to pepper it up. There are witches, fairies, and even a unicorn.  It's a light love story with a bit of enchantment. It's fine, but truthfully I prefer Gaiman's other books which are more thoughtful (American Gods) or more humorous (Neverwhere).

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Before going to see Phantom, I had no idea what I was getting into. I just thought, \\"Oh well this looks good, might as well see it.\\" So, a friend and I went and ever since that day, I have not been able to stop thinking about it. This truly was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Just three days later, I was BEGGING to see it again!  <br /> <br />No movie has ever had this intense effect on me.  Gerard Butler's performance as the Phantom was simply (well, NOT so simply) MINDBLOWING.  He put his heart and soul into every word, every movement, every glance and totally dissolved his being into this role.  To this day, I still can't see HIM within the Phantom.  Emmy Rossum was the best possible and  most excellent choice for Christine.  Vocally and emotionally, she portrayed her character to the full extent.  Even her facial expressions, which constituted the best depiction of her role, delivered the credibility needed 100%.  Every actor within this movie were truly the best at their roles.  No other substitutions have ever even come up within my mind.  <br /> <br />The art direction, the cinematography, the costumes, the music, the extraordinary acting...nothing is left out. Altogether, these all made this a masterpiece. Every little piece and detail of this movie made it what it is.  Even if one litle thing were missing, it would take away from the entire film.  I have not been able to stop raving about this since I saw it three months ago, and just the thought of owning it on DVD makes me the happiest person on earth.   <br /> <br />I have never FULLY loved any movie, every single part of one, before. This is the exception to every, and I mean every, rule.  Those critics that rave on and on about how this movie was abominable?  Yeah, well, they're all outnumbered and ignored by all the fans whose lives and furthermore, SOULS, have been touched by this movie. To sum it up, it really doesn't get any better than this. If I could strongly recommend just one thing,one movie, one piece of brilliance, this would definitely be it, a thousand times over.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I first hear about this title coming out I wasn't to excited that it was because I found that christina's first CD a bore and just another teenage \\"singer\\"  who just got lucky to get a break.

B000003TA4|1.0|Pay no attention to all the hype about this band/CD \\"Nirvana-Nevermind\\".  This is a TERRIBLE album.  I'm yet to hear an album worse than this one.  <br /> <br />Only in the 90s could an unstable dopehead who called himself \\"Kurdt\\" be hailed as a \\"genius\\" and a \\"brilliant songwriter\\".  Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter?  Is that when he's on cocain or heroin?  In the drug crazed world of the Seattle grunge scene, everybody was too high to see Kurt Cobain for what he was--an unbathed, greasy, dirty looking lowlife--out of his mind on drugs--who wrote incoherent lyrics about how miserable life is.  <br /> <br />\\"With the lights out its less dangerous <br />Here we are now entertain us <br />I feel stupid and contagious <br />Here we are now entertain us\\" <br /> <br />Is that what you call \\"brilliant songwriting\\"?  It doesn't sound very brilliant to me.  All it sounds like to me is the angry, incoherent ranting of an unstable dopehead.  Kurt Cobain's lyrics are meaningless.  Just a bunch of incoherant rants that he scribbled in his diary after sticking filthy needles in his arm.   <br /> <br />Don't buy into the hype about this album.  No matter how many \\"Rolling Stone\\" articles praise it as the \\"Best Album of the 90s\\", don't pay any attention.  Anybody that thinks distorted guitar noise, angry yelling, and incoherent screaming qualifies as \\"brilliant songwriting\\" has been totally brainwashed by the media.  Nirvana was so awful, no amount of words can fully describe their awfulness.  It is incomprehensible how incredibly awful Nirvana was.  RRRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!  I hate this band!

B00005JNTV|5.0|Sin City is based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, who is also the co-director. The movie is split into three stories: Dwight's, Merv's, and Hartigan's. Quentin Taratino is also a guess director.<br /><br />The movie starts off with Hartigan, a \\"60 year old cop with a bum ticker\\" and he is trying to save a little girl from being raped. He  ends up sacrficing himself for the girl, \\"a old man for a young girl\\". We cut to Merv's story, when a hooker is dead in his bed, and he has the blame placed on his shoulders, he tries to find the man that killed her, and avenges her. We then cut to Dwight, who is then thrown into the war between the prostitutes and the city police, They are seriously teething on the brink of war, and He must find a way to stop what could be deadly. Then, We are thrown back into Hartigan's story, 8 years later, he is in the same situtation, but the people have changed. He has to stop the Yellow Bastard from raping Nancy again.<br /><br />This movie almost didn't happen because The Director's Guild of America didn't want Robert Rodreqiuz to make this film, so he quit the quild, and worked with Frank Miller on this film, creating a page by page movie that makes you feel that the book had come alive on the movie screen. The acting is at its best, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis do their best acting, since their last best acting, and help shape and mold the movie. This is a prime example of esteemed originality, and hard work. It is a might fine film that can put you on a roller coster ride through the place that is called Sin City.

B000002JKA|5.0|This Cd is one of the best i have ever heard. All of the songs are the essense of musicianship and something you cannot find on tv or top 20 hits. Songs like Erotomania and Space-Dye Vest are some of DT's best and the album really is one of their best as well as there is not a bad song on it. <br /> <br />It makes me mad to see bratty little punks with names like MTV Rocks talk about how John Petrucci, one of the best guitar players ever, is a loser and sucks because he wears his strap high. Are you saying that wearing your guitar low and playing nothing but power chords makes you a good guitar player? Kurt Cobain and Good Charlotte are better than John Petrucci? And then saying Mike Portnoy is Bad? Mike Portnoy is one of the best drummers out there as well. Not all drummers play in bands with wierd shifting time signatures and certainly not top 20 bands like good charlotte and nirvana. this just goes to show how really underappreciated REAL music is today.
B0008JFMFG|5.0|the quality was very good, but since we have all seen this movie, ya right we havent because this is a horrible movie. movie quality is 5 stars but the movie not so good.
B000244EMO|4.0|And that is for NOT remastering the damn print. It still has the same transfer as the previous edition which suffered - oh, what could have been! Aside from that, this classic has at last been given its due with a chock-full of supplements. It would have been off the f_____g charts if they'd managed to have Arnold and Jesse in for a commentary, but John McTiernan is good enough with a solid track full of details that I really enjoyed listening to. As far as the film itself, I swoon every time Ol'Painless has screen time, and the dialogue between all the cast is tight and fun chew over again and again. Tension throughout is amped and executed perfectly.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|My gosh, reviewer Adam Bernstein, can't we have a thoughtful review of a World War II DVD set without injecting modern-day, vitriolic hate speech (\\"Cheneyism\\") into the mix? Oh, puh...lease!!
B00007G1ZC|4.0|This is definitely one title I would love to see in HD as it's beautifully shot and composed (featuring classic \\"bookend\\" framings). The use of color is masterful and the stories themselves are captivating. I quite liked Scorsese as Van Gogh with attitude. Watch this one on as large a screen you can - you'll see why.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|Picked up the Deluxe edition and agree with Joshua Homme's assessment that \\"Lullabye's\\" is best listened to in the evening. Good record to make love to.
0792833201|5.0|That tree was the most frightening scene (the clown, too) in the film for me. I really wanted the boy to get eaten by it. Where's the deluxe edition?
B000268QB2|2.0|\\"Somewhere only we know\\" is the best song by far and the only one worth buying. It a great song and sounds just like Travis. I thought it was Travis when I heard it. And I had seen Keane on SNL previously. They werne't too good on there. Voice cracking and all. I don't get the comparisons to Coldplay. They sound nothing alike aside from the use of a piano. I wouldn't recommend buying the whole album. Just buy the one song off iTunes. The rest of the album is really cheesy. Don't waste your money.
B00008PC2O|4.0|This is one of the coolest Sci-Fi movies of all time. It doesn't live up to The Matrix in my book, but definately holds it's own and stuns the audience with eye candy and good storytelling.    The T-1000 is awesome, he is liquid metal, so he can shape shift into other peoples forms. He also slices and impales victims, which can be disturbing.    See this film, but be prepared for the high intensity level.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'm not a particularly religious person. I, fact, I tend to switch channels when the \\"God slot\\" comes on the TV. This, coupled with rumours of an anti-Semitic bias (certainly untrue IMHO) and no particular fondness for Mel Gibson (I regarded Braveheart and The Patriot as historically inaccurate anglophobic nonsense), put me off seeing this movie at the cinema.  My lady went to see it though and found it an immensely powerful experience and said I just /had/ to watch it.    <br /> <br />So I got the DVD, sat in my comfiest armchair surrounded by my 5.1 speakers, cup of tea at my side, and pressed play. <br /> <br />Two hours later, the tea had gone cold and, with tears in my eyes, I felt utterly emotionally drained and profoundly moved in a way that no film has affected me before.  For that reason alone I could not award any less than five stars. <br /> <br />Other reviewers here have already given detailed accounts of the screenplay and, as this is very much a movie that does /exactly/ what it says on the tin, I won't comment further on the story.  The consensus appears to be though that The Passion is very faithful to the Gospel accounts, although Gibson clearly does take some liberties with the personification of Satan (Rosalinda Celantano as a unsettlingly androgenous figure, which made me think of Marilyn Manson for some weird reason!). <br /> <br />Magnificently filmed - from sweeping landscapes of a beautifully recreated holy land, to the excruciating detail of Christ's suffering, complemented by a powerful score and impeccable acting (most notably Hristo Shopov's oscar-worthy Pilate), this is a triumph, which you don't have to be a devout Christian to feel moved by. <br /> <br />A unique cinematic experience, but one of such intensity that I don't know when I will watch The Passion again. <br />
B00062RCBW|5.0|It is Star Trek, fantastic. <br /> <br />My main reason for reviewing is to get the word out that nobody should go cheap on the price and get the asian release. Although advertised as the exact same thing, many episodes are cut off, AT THE END!! So you'll miss the ending of every few episodes, unless you use an online review site. <br /> <br />I highly suggest for any trek fan, to give out the extra cash, and purchase the american release. From amazon.com or one of the used ones, make sure it is the american release!
0800177363|5.0|(CAUTION: SPOILER INFO)  Just think if your life was stopped much like someone using a remote control \\"pause\\" button - only to have it started with a push of \\"play\\" for a short time and then crucially and finally returned back to the paused state.  The movie Awakenings, based on the neurologist Oliver Sacks book, does just that.  In it Williams as Dr Malcolm uncovers a drug called L-Dopa that can be used to \\"start\\" patients from their immobilized state of being.  Only to have them return to their previous state after the drug loses its effectiveness.  Regardless of the final outcome of these patients, ultimately, it is the journey of the doctors, patients and their families that makes this movie so special.    Especially the chemistry that forms between the Williams and DeNiro.    There is one scene that will never leave my mind.  It is when Dr Malcolm completes the black-n-white checked pattern on the hospital floor for a patient he is attempting to help.  Look for it when you watch it and you will see what I mean. It's special.    If you like dramas that make you think, (even if they don't always have a happy ending)  then this is your type of movie  It's a buy
B00005JNPZ|5.0|I wanted to watch something light and fun.  I expected to like it, but I did not expect to laugh so hard.    Will Smith is fantastic, but Kevin James (Albert) steals the show.  Chick flick?  Not so much.  It appeals to both sexes. My brother and his guy friend loved it too.  We all walked out laughing and doing the Qtip dance! I'm giving it five stars because it did the job of making me laugh, making my heart melt just a little bit, and all without being cheezy or corny.
B000002J29|5.0|This was a fine snapshot of the post \\"Peter Gabriel\\" Genesis show. The performances are precise. They flow nicely. The \\"Dance on a Volcano\Los Endos\\" is just a masterpeice. Well worth the investment for the Genesis fan.
0780622553|5.0|For such an original idea this movie didn't do that well in theaters which I am surprised at considering it had good performances by Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt, and Rufus Sewell. Anyways Dark City focuses on this man named John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) who awakens in a strange motel and can't remember a thing. On top of that he is wanted a for a series of murders. Under the Dark city lurks, these creepy underground dwellers who have the power to stop time and alter reality. They switch people's memories and create new ones as well. John Murdoch struggles to unravel his twisted identity but realizes that unraveling the truth can be fatal. Overall a very different original Sci-fi movie, amazing special effects, good acting. As for the dvd two solid commentaries and some comparisons on Fritz lang's \\"Metropolis\\" which isn't all that bad, but I guess since this movie wasn't that popular it won't be getting a special edition anytime soon. If it does come out I will deff. be purchasing it, well worth the extra money.
B00005JMEW|5.0|A good movie that any good director should direct.Tarantino's got it.You got Uma Thurman,David Carradine,Vivica A. Fox,Daryl Hannah,and Luck Liu. Not to mention a cameo appearance of Sonny Chiba-what's better than that?!The cartoonish kitsch factor is what makes the movie quite so addictive-blood,lots of FAKE blood from one human body that even a real human body can't contain.The dialog,for example-The Bride(Thurman) and GoGo Yubari(Chiaki Kuriyama)and use of Japanese language.Music was played part of it.The pan-flute that Tarantino said he heard in a Thai restaurant found perfect for the key scenes when The Bride recieved her steel from Hattori Hanzo(Chiba).Even the the way the Chinese/Japanese actors played as the Crazy 88's carried themselves in the House of Blue Leaves where Oren Ishii(Liu)makes a grand entrance,Buck the male r.n.,and the Japanese Charlie Brown who works at the House of Blue Leaves where the showdown between The Bride and Oren takes place.A movie quite humorously funny and just makes you want to observe every scene.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|\\"Everwood\\" is an instant classic: funny, warm, intelligent - superbly acted, written and directed, with clever dialogue and surprising twists. When will Season 2 be released??????
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morisette's 1995 debut - her being barely out of her teens - remains one of the most powerful debut albums of the 90's, and with its amazing freshness and uniqueness - plus five hit singles - it was enough to catapult this 21 old non-blonde to instant superstar status, one to be maintained yet, even if not one of her subsequent albums could come close to matching the first; and a first like this one it tough to match. Alanis was original, fresh and one-of-a-kind; any attempt to stick a label on her would be futile. Despite her very young age, she was never a teenage pop singer; she drew attention by her sheer talent, never by her looks or her show, and therefore appealed to a more mature and sophisticated audience. Her music was complex and intelligent, yet very earthly, and not as artistic as to alienate herself from many people, like Tori Amos or Bjork. <br /> <br />Her music did have some elements in common with the punk chicks of her time like Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson or Meredith Brooks, but she never depended on a band around her (well, yes, Flea and Dave Navarro helped out, and it shows, but it sounds nothing like a Chili Peppers album and all like an Alanis album). She's angry all right, but she never depended on distortion and on hard drums, though those are often present; on the contrary, her music works by way of incredibly powerful silences. The songs stand by themselves, the only important instrument being her wonderful and unique voice. <br /> <br />Alanis's lyrics are of great anger and pain, but they are not bleak. Alanis is the eternal optimistic, a strong, street-wise, independent woman. In that respect, perhaps Tori Amos is the best comparison of the artists mentioned above. Bitterness is all over songs like 'You Oughta Know' and 'Right Through You', but Alanis never wallows in self-pity. Her final attitude is always triumphant. And in songs like 'You Learn' and 'Hand in my Pocket', she shows her happy point of view. <br /> <br />'Ironic' may have been the biggest hit to come out of this album - it had the best video, sure enough - but it might as well be the weakest song on the album. Every single song here, in fact, is a modern classic; despite simple harmonies and rhythms, Alanis's performance makes each one a powerhouse. Other than 'You Oughta Know', maybe the most memorable song on the album, a hard screamer powered up by Navarro's (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers) wonderful guitar, other stand-out tracks include 'All I Really Want', a fantastic opener with beautiful and angry lyrics; 'Perfect', a heart-wrenching telling of a harsh childhood; 'Head Over Feet', a wonderful and light-hearted love song; and my personal favorite 'Not The Doctor', yet another anthem of independence and strength, which has a fantastic chord progression and a very strong chorus, not to mention another emotional and powerful performance. <br /> <br />Unless you're a big fan, 'Jagged Little Pill' is probably all the Alanis Morisette you'll ever need (though I also warmly recommend her 'Unplugged' performance), and it's a lot. It tells you most everything you need to know about one of today's most creative recording artists, and is a beautiful album that's always a pleasure to listen to.
B000002LUB|5.0|A fine return to form for Black Sabbath.  After years of albums with the likes of Tony Martin, Glenn Hughes and Ian Gillan, Tony Iommi reunites with the Mob Rules line-up with Geezer Butler, Vinny Appice, and Ronnie James Dio.  When Vinny Appice and Dio left Sabbath during the mixing of Live Evil, there was a feeling of \\"unfinished business,\\" so when I heard Dio had rejoined Sabbath  was hoping they'd pick up where they left off with Mob Rules.  This CD does that, and more.  From beginning to end, this CD does not disappoint.  Gone are the fantasies of rainbows, dragons and kings.  The topics here are technology, insanity, televangelism and other more-earthly concerns.  What a shame this reunion lasted only one CD, but it was great that this volatile line-up got one more CD under its belt.  My favorites from this CD include Computer God, TV Crimes, Master of Insanity, and I.  This CD and Dio's subsequent \\"Strange Highways\\" are two sides of the same coin, both worthy of your CD collection.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Ok, I am a HUGE south Park Fan. HUGE !!! I think the passion of the Jew is incredibly intelligent, the episode of the mormons hilarious, the whole 8th season is masterpeices after masterpieces.  <br /> <br />I also am a huge fan of the first film. I truly think it was one of the top twenty american comedies of ALL TIME !!! So, needless to say i was expecting this one with great anticipation.  <br /> <br />What could I say ? Of course it is sometimes brilliant (RENT PARODY is truly a must !!, the Paris scene is great, \\"Freedom isn't free\\" \\"America Fkk yeah!\\" are good songs) but with big letdowns (\\"Pearlharbour sucked\\" is a very bad song and it is hardly funny, \\"Dicks and pussies\\" is a bit tiresome, the computer INTELLIGENCE is ridiculous, and quite frankly I think that Michael Moore bashing is so \\"pass\\".  <br /> <br />I would say that this movie would have been great if it hasn't been the followup of such a great movie. I would still give it 5 stars but I am really expecting more for the net one ...  <br />
031219126X|3.0|This edition contains several critical essays about Frankenstein (they follow the actual story).  Each essay uses a particular literary theory and applies it to the text 9in front of the essay is a description/analysis of the theory being used).  For example, one essay applies Freud's Oedipus Complex and Lacan's Mirror Stage to the development of Victor and the monster.  Some of the other theories are Feminism, Marxism and New Historicism.  It is interesting to see the novel from all these different perspectives.  Expect to see contradictions in interruptions from theory to theory.  My only complaint is the selection of essays. Half of them are poorly chosen (ex. Psychoanalysis and Feminism).  I could have selected a better selection.  The essays can be very confusing; jumping all over the place and trying to cover to many ideas at once.  It takes awhile simply to figure out exactly what the author's main point is. You would have better luck simply researching the theory and then applying what you know yourself to the text.  Either way, it is a fun exercise and makes one appreciate even more just how amazing a book it truly is.
B000059TFO|3.0|Two FBI agents (Gene Hackman and Willem Defoe) with radically different approaches to their jobs turn a small Mississippi town inside out in their effort to solve the murders of three civil rights workers.  The film is well made with a strong sense of place and the acting is uniformly brilliant, but it is fundamentally flawed because of its lack of black characters.  This film basically presents the civil rights struggle as the story of white people trying to sort out how they should treat black people.  Relegating black characters to being the backdrop for a white dilemma is disrespectful and presents an unbalanced portrait of the situation.  Having said that, I must also acknowledge that the film does a good job of presenting a chilling and knowing portrait of white racism as the unfocused and uncomprehending rage that is the result of ignorance, poverty, and self-loathing.  Frances McDormand gives a strong, nuanced performance as a shy, beaten down woman who turns out to be the key to breaking the case.  Her relationship with Hackman's character is quite touching./
B00008K9Z5|1.0|escuse me while i puke on this cd, i urge you not to buy.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|Overall this was a pretty good documentary about Metallica. Though they came off as whiney b****. I was a serious metallica fan before viewing this film. I respected their music. Now I got to know the real guys behind the band and see how they act when not on stage and their true selves. These guys fight, alot. They act immature, fight with eachother, act like a**es. Definetly have less respect for them now then before. There were some very funny parts in the film, interesting look at the band. It was excruciatingly long. Its a mixed bag. Some good , some bad , some funny parts. I was hoping to see more of Mustaine though. It shocked me that Mustaine was there spilling his guts about feeling inferior or not as good as Metallica. I admire Mustaines lyrics and musical talent and think he writes Lyrics 20 times more intelligent than Metallica. As far as music goes Metallica is better or equal to Megadeth. But I find them both great bands with diffrent things to love about them. Mustaine is very successful and I dont know why hes still pissed or upset about being kicked out of Metallica. He dosent even need them to be great. He can do that all on his own. The film covers alot- Taped during the making of st anger, Shows Lars and his napster issues. During that I was thinking what the hell does lars care about napster for they already have millions and millions of dollars and they cant let some of their fans get a song for free. Greedy. But I can understand them wanting to get paid for their work but come on. He might have taken it a little to far. Overall good documentary but very long. 3.5 stars.
B00008S2VG|3.0|As always with this lady, there's something different about this project. Rather than expressing her love for her daughter and new-found religion in Ray of Light and expressing her love for her new husband in Music, she's expressing her, say, disgust for herself, taking an entire society along with her, with this one. I just wish she would have done it a bit BETTER.<br /><br />Her last album sounded more like a compilation rather than a forged offering; each song sounded different than the rest. This album has 11 songs, a fourth of which sound similar to each other. This is not what I was expecting from Madonna.<br /><br />The production ranges from good to over-the-top. You wonder in some tracks whether this is what Mirwais, Madonna, et al. really wanted or if it's just an experiment for much better things in the future (I'm hoping for the latter). Furthermore, let's face it, the lady isn't great with vocals. This is why I hoped that the production of the music would save it.<br /><br />Even so, the album contains a few standout tracks, ones that can rival some of her more popular/ excellent songs. These are \\"Love Profusion\\" and \\"Nothing Fails\\". The rest of the album is either sub-par to just okay, with the possible exception of the other good tracks (\\"Hollywood\\" and maybe \\"Nobody Knows Me\\").<br /><br />She stumbled a bit here. Here's to hoping her next album wouldn't be so self-loathing.
B0001Z52RU|2.0|Im reading reviews here that say the critics didnt like this film cause it had Ashton Kutcher in it or this n that. They didnt like this film cause it was bad, Truly BAD. I read the rave reviews on this site and purchased it full price thinking it was going to be good so Id take a chance. What a mistake. A bunch of convuluted mixed up crap. Starring Ashton Kutcher who I think should stick to TV and shows like ( That 70s show ) instead of trying to be a film actor because he just dosent cut it. Hes better at comedy. He dosent give a good performance as a serious actor nor did i buy it. Amy Smart was mediocre in this role. The whole film was mediocre at best, barely watchable. Long tedious and boring. Ashton Kutcher stars as a college kid who keeps revisiting his past and going back in time through a notebook he kept when he was younger. The movie is basically about what would happen if he did somthing diffrent in his past and what would happen if he could change it and the situations it would lead to and how it would affect peoples lives. No matter how he changes it the outcome always seems to be bad. Him and his mother encounter a fortune teller during the movie that says something to the extent of you were never meant to be born or you dont have a soul. It all comes together at the end of the film. During all this nonsense he keeps re reading his notebook and starts to go into a transe and his nose starts bleeding. Very lame. I cant even get into all the details of this film- to mixed up to describe. I would recomend you rent this first before purchasing then decide. See if you can take it or even sit through it. 2.5 stars
B000022TSW|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I've watched a couple episodes of the show but this movie STILL surprised me.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this movie is about the boys of South Park (Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny) seeing an R-rated movie causing the outrage of parents everywhere, war with Canada, and the apocalypse.<br /><br />Celebrities are targeted in this movie. From Alanis Morissette to the Baldwin brothers, and Celine Dion to Winona Ryder. Films such as Saving Private Ryan and Patton are also lampooned. And of course, like the show, racism, sex, violence, homosexuality,... are also featured.<br /><br />Did I say that it's brilliant?? Trey Parker and Matt Stone seemed to have interwoven these \\"controversial\\" subject matters into the seemingly innocent lives of the four boys gracefully, with an outstanding outcome. The movie spends no more than 10 or so seconds to be serious with itself, a thunderstorm bringing torrential, ridiculous humor as fast as the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and of equal adrenaline.<br /><br />Adult humor at its best?? Maybe. Will it appeal to everyone?? Maybe. Did I laugh through almost the whole hour and a half?? YES.
B0000067L2|4.0|Cream - Disraeli Gears (1967)<br /><br />These 60s rock gods made some of the best music of the era which was, along with Jimi Hendrix, a precursor to Heavy Metal. Each musician was and still is extremely talented. Drummer Ginger Baker loved to make full use of his kit. He turned the drums into musical instruments, far beyond simply functioning to keep time. Especially of note was his genius use of the double kick drums, putting all his limbs into fluid motion. Eric Clapton really came into his own with Cream, finally playing with musicians who could really challenge him. As great as his music has been over the years, I think his playing with Cream finds him at his most adventurous, a true creative peak. And main vocalist Jack Bruce is a unique bassist who could hold his own with Clapton.<br /><br />Having said all that, this album, great as it is, doesn't exactly sound timeless to me. It's very much stuck in the 60s, a product of its time. Of course, the best rock ever made was in the 60s and DISREALI GEARS is very enjoyable today, but I think younger kids just getting into it won't look at it the same way or even as fondly as those who were there. I actually hate a lot of the frat-punk, nu-metal, whatever-you-want-to-label-it that's around today, but I don't think younger people would find Cream as exciting as newer bands like, say, Van Halen, Rage Against the Machine, Death or Mars Volta. Of course, this review will get poo-pooed on by the old cheese-cutter types who were \\"there\\" and who would claim that 60s groups like Cream are the be-all-end-all of rock and that rock has hardly changed or progressed in any interesting way since then (me? I'm somewhere in between, born in 1970).<br /><br />Also, many rock fans will no doubt be happy with a \\"best-of\\" Cream collection that includes the best songs from this album (\\"Strange Brew,\\" \\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses,\\" and \\"SWLABR\\"); the others are less essential. They're good though, especially if you like old-school blues with standard chord changes - Cream handles this style expertly.<br /><br />Like most really talented bands, seeing them live is where it's at. To my amazement, they've recently reunited and immediately started selling out shows in London. If you can't catch them, at least try to get a hold of some classic live footage where they've really played out their improvisational jazz-influenced skills to the hilt.<br /><br />My impressions of DISRAELI GEARS:<br /><br />\\"Strange Brew\\" - killer, loping melody that's almost funky. Clapton totally off the hook and all over the frets. *****<br /><br />\\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" - a monster, possibly their most famous tune save for \\"White Room\\" which still gets played to death on classic rock radio. Incredible, but Jimi Hendrix, who loved Cream, could play this one better than anybody. *****<br /><br />\\"World of Pain\\" - good song, classic Cream sound, Clapton tripping the psychedelic tones. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Dance the Night Away\\" - mysterious sounding rocker loaded with psychedelia. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Blue Condition\\" - written (and I believe sung) by Ginger Baker, this is a quirky waltz with honky-tonk piano accents. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" - \\"Slow Hand\\" speaks through his guitar in pure note-warping heaven. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"SWLABR\\" - with the possible exception of \\"Crossroads,\\" this might be the most upbeat, exciting, rockin'-est Cream tune ever and my personal favorite on the album. *****<br /><br />\\"We're Going Wrong\\" - as the title indicates, this is a rather downbeat number, although Ginger is just all over his drums. Amazing performance, but probably my least favorite track here. ***<br /><br />\\"Outside Woman Blues\\" - upbeat, standard blues, Clapton on vocals. Quite enjoyable if you're into this sort of thing. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Take It Back\\" - peppy down home blues shuffle accented with harmonica and crowd noises. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Mother's Lament\\" - basically a joke song with vocals and piano, the boys hamming it up, having a ball.<br /><br />Worth getting, and I would agree with most other reviewers here, this is Cream's best album - but see 'em live! (however you can!)cals and piano, the boys hamming it up, having a ball.<br /><br />Worth getting, and I would agree with most other reviewers here, this is Cream's best album - but see 'em live!

6305127646|3.0|Val Kilmer stars in this relatively light film about a thief-for-hire whose so close to reaching his target goal.  But the end is never easy and Kilmer's character (the thief) finds out there may be more then just money at stake.         This film is pretty enjoyable, and has a nice basis that it goes from.  For instance, Kilmer's character does not just change his name because he has too, but because of the anonyminity with which he has lived his whole life.  Thus we are intrigued, and as his character humorously goes from disguise to disguise to escape \\"them\\" all, we just cannot help but get a little caught up.         As one reviewer mentioned, Kilmer fans should enjoy his different \\"selves\\", or saints of the moment if you will.  Yet, this film is actually just good-natured, and a bit dramatic (action) at times too.  So the fan cannot helped be pulled in a bit, at least to see, well, what is his name?
