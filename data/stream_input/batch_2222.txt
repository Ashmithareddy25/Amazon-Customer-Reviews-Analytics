B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was a very good book! Reminded me of a rated G fifty shades of grey. I certainly didn't expect it to be so good!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|One of the better-written series out there.  Well acted and entertainingly funny.  Definitely worth a watch if nothing else for the humor.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|A very addicting sequel to the Outlander series.  If you aren't in love with Jamie Fraser by now, you are hopeless.
B005PK56TA|4.0|While this show was a very good spin on the usual ghost story it was getting kind of strange in the end but very worth the time spent to watch.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Easy to enter dates and love the monthly view.  Icons are not only fun but helpful.  I am so pleased with the app.
B003B02O0A|5.0|A very nice read and not too much legal jargon for the people who do not like too much technical speak..really get into the characters and time period the story took place..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|In love with this book! I knew this book was going go be amazing based on the number of reviews it had, and only being released for a few months! However, I had no idea how deeply this book would affect me. The sensitive and unthinkable subject matter is written so eloquently and believably, I just can't even adequately relay my feelings about this book. Life-altering would be a good description. So beautifully and tragically written, and again, so believable. Not to mention I read ALOT of books, so much of the subject matter has become repetitive and predictable. Not this book-there were several plot twists I did not see coming. Just amazing. New lifelong fan of Hoover!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|really fun puzzle game. I like this one because you can play for a couple of minutes or for hours. it's great for killing time in a waiting room or anywhere you need to pass some time. Colors are vibrant and the pictures are quite nice. Can play relaxed or get competatively.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|It starters off easy but gets progressively harder rather quickly.  Great fun keeps me challenged, reminds me of another game called enlay.
B00563K3DA|1.0|I thought this book was very contrived and simplistic.  The conversations reminded me of an info-mercial!  A waste of time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is exactly what it's advertised as: a relatively challenging puzzle game. If you want something to keep you occupied while waiting, this works great.
B000076CY6|5.0|Everything we expected!  I have never been disappointed in Lego products.<br />Lego + LOTR = one very happy 9 year old
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Ok read but not quite believable.  I was hoping to find a new author to fit in with Tom Clancy and Dale Brown this isn't it or anything near that level of quality

B00969PR18|5.0|I needed this on my Kindle, and it works.  No problems and now freezing up or crashing.  Can't beat that!
B000NY12LO|5.0|I always enjoy books by this author, but this one was particularly riveting and heart wrenching.  Ms Picoult seems to do a tremendous amount of research for all of her novels and the characters are so real.  I felt like I knew the people involved in the story.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It's a case cover people, it's not going to do any tricks or make your life any easier.  It keeps the Kindle from getting scratched.  'Nuf said.
B00884GR0W|3.0|Good game but I play Minecraft Pocket and its better.  Kind of dumb because u have to get 20 iron and 10 gold on the 3rd quest.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|The book is a good mystery and you learn a great deal about Scotland and how the police force operates. Protagonist is not one who listens to authority and all characters are well-developed. In this case, perhaps too many characters; it is a book that has to be read carefully.Like Henning Mankill books, the main character has a personal life that continues through the series. Rankin can conjure up atmosphere extremely well, the rain and nastiness of the weather is oftimes mentioned.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The best part is that this game is not repetitious. Beautiful graphics. Well worth the price to continue to the end.
0062238868|5.0|I had been planning to read this book before Chris Kyle was tragically murdered.  When that happened, I ordered it immediately to learn more about the man who earned my respect and awe - in his own words.  His comments on death and dying have an eerie meaning, considering the circumstances, and give the reader an insight into a very introspective man.  I loved the book.  I loved what this man did.  I hurt deeply for his wife and children, who were just beginning to enjoy a life with husband and father.  How sad.  But how lucky this country is to have had this man protecting us and our troops.  Buy it.

8866130923|3.0|I love moleskine and all of their notebooks out on the market.  This is the 3rd year in a row that I have purchased their weekly notebook planner.  My favorite feature of the planner was the 12month overview calendar pages at the beginning of the planner set up like a traditional calendar with room enough in each square to write in and room enough at the bottom of the page to write goals for the month or notes; for whatever reason, moleskine changed that format to a list kind of calendar (I don't know what the technical term is but you can see it on the moleskine website).  I found it extremely disappointing and annoying to use, so I don't use it at all.  I won't be buying a planner next year if this format remains the same.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows.if you haven't seen it yet please start from the beginning and watch it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent read,  he was an amazing man.  He predicted in 1996 that the Internet would change the way the world buys products.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|good value for the price, worked really well at sharpening everything I could get my hands on after it arrived.
B00821OX98|3.0|Even though my score was a 3/5 out of five I still think it was really entertaining. My biggest problem is that halfway through the season it gets hard to follow. You see one character in a specific location and captured and then in the next episode you see him in a completely different location. Also I feel like they aren't doing enough to make me really care about the characters on screen. Overall check it out if you like Resistance type shows.
B008CX2A2I|4.0|it functions, adds bluetooth to my receiver for a pretty small price. I only wish it had a dedicated port and didn't have to eat up my only front usb (where my iPod is normally connected.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I really loved this movie and in my opinion it is the best James Bond movie to date. In my opinion I think everything's great from the action to the story. Sam Mendes (Director) really did a good job with this movie and I am sad at the news that he will not be directing the next James Bond movie. Overall I highly recommend it.

B003MYYJD0|5.0|Love It, my hubby shows it off and he was very surprised when I ordered it.  Shipping was great.  Product in excellent condition, I would recommend this product.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|But pictures definitely don't do justice to the way these cans sound. Coming from a pair that promises to make your music sound like the artist intended it to, the differences between a bass-heavy, brand-hyped pair of headphones and one that actually delivers their promise became immediately apparent. Amazon service was awesome, just ordered them on the 6th and received them today.<br /><br />The 7506 definitely pumps out bass. However, that is not strictly what these cans were designed for. No, they won't win any awards for style, nor will they make you run faster or instantly turn you into an audio professional, but they tell the truth. First, they completely cover the ears, so forget about hearing anything else while you have them on. Bass is punchy, mids and highs are easily distinguished from other components. I found the overall sound quite impressive. Compared to other brands, the sound profile of these are relatively flat, in a good way. I'm not saying that there aren't some out there that won't blow these away, but I am impressed. Also, the treble seemed a little crunchy at first. After a couple of days this seems to have evened out.<br /><br />They put out plenty of sound with low volume settings. The source does not have to be turned up very high to achieve ear-damaging levels, so keep that in mind. With MP3 players, that can translate into longer battery life and fewer blown headphone jacks.<br /><br />Feeling these in my hand, I noticed that the headband is made of spring steel and all of the mounts seem sturdy, although I have yet to test their durability. They're comfortable, at least from my observations. Wearing glasses also makes a huge difference in the comfort level of headphones. I have no qualms with wearing these for extended periods of time, outside of the slight warm feeling that the surrounds unleash on your ears.<br /><br />I must admit that I didn't have very high expectations at first. I did a little research before buying these and found out that these are indeed the industry standard for broadcasters, studios, etc.. Still, nothing beats being able to actually put them on and try them before purchasing. If I'd have had that luxury, I would have purchased these over a year ago. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be recommending them and Amazon to my friends.

0749957069|5.0|Oh my God, Drageus! What a dragon and a Alpha Male.  I loved this book! Even though he is arrogant, over bearing, rude and has a awful temper, I just loved him.  He was also loving, protective, and could even be sweet on occasion.  The best best in this series for sure.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I liked the movie. The concept of the movie was a great one. Won't say too much other then I liked it when he beat himself up. Have to watch it to know what I mean.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is truly an intriguing character who constantly surprises the reader (along with Dr. Watson).  His unique methods of unraveling the intricacies of crime and deception will amaze you as you travel through this volume of short stories and &#34;mini-novels&#34;.<br />From the start, I have been reluctant to put the book down--- even between adventures so masterfully told by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  I wholeheartedly recommend this volume to any one who enjoys mystery and is up to the challenge of deductive reasoning--<br />which is &#34;simple&#34; only to Sherlock Holmes himself.
B009329ZF2|4.0|You have to be a sci-fy nut to enjoy this movie. Come on, trasformer type effects. Mean aliens,the under dog humans and a classic old girl of a Battleship.

But,still very good,if you dont like explicit material,its proably not going to be for you,me,I love my 'mommy porn' books!  Happy Reading!

B00A8ECU24|5.0|its fun playful and it caters to bronies as well as all others. so i strongly suggest this game. i play this on my kindle fire and is easy to play on the kindle so i would think it would be easy on any other device. i also experienced no lag whatsoever.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|This is a rare movie in that it tells the story as much theatrically as cinematically. The result is very stylized yet brings the book vividly to life. The direction is impeccable and Knightley impressive. But Law's is the performance to watch, when you consider he could as easily have been cast as Vronsky .
0399157565|5.0|This was a good read-- I would suggest this book  to anyone that decides to buy this murder mystery.. I totally enjoy Patricia Cornwell, as Kay Scarpetta, she keeps this character going and I love following the story.
B005PK56TA|5.0|There are some points in this series that are harder to stomach than other points, but the show seems to keep grabbing and pulling you in, and isn't that what you really want in a story?

B00BHMF578|3.0|A very well made film. But it has changed facts. It does not differentiate between the government, who was against raiding the US embassy, and the demonstrators, who were seeking extradition of the Shah, by the Americans. The second point it portraits the Iranian people as hating foreigners, as depicted in the Tehran Bazaar seen. Again it does not differentiate between them and the government. In the end the movie encourages hatred towards Iran. Is the timing intentional?
B008YBOGVG|5.0|The musical credentials of this great CD have been iterated many times over - and still remain.  Many years after its original CD release with compressed sound - this remaster of the original album release is sonically wonderful and long overdue - a major improvement on what we've heard before. The real revelation/(s) are the original mixes without the Stevie Winwood overdubs. Rather than collector's items - nice to have and listen to once - wished I'd never bothered - these are just terrific.<br />All of them hold their own with the released versions while some, in my mind are superior to the overdubs (\\"Working Class Hero\\" and \\"Why'd Ya Do It\\" - the mixes have a lot more edge and urgency) while some are sufficiently different to make the songs 'new'. I can imagine there must have been considerable debate on the overdubs when the original vinyl was released. With \\"Sister Morphine\\" and various other remixes, this is a great addition to Marianne Faithfull's recorded output - a nice surprise.<br />The mpeg movie of Disc 1 is of historical interest - only so so.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i have been enjoying this game. you need to make friends to get thingsbut the friend options are easy you get 5 free invites every 7 hours. time consuming and slow but if you arent looking to play every min then you can easily have some fun with this.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|I brought this for a friend's son, he had been asking her for a headset for months.  Sowhen his birthday came around, I got him one. Her only rule was the headset could only cover one ear. Set up was very easy and I was able to help him do it over the phone. He was amazed by the sound and being able to hear things he had never heard before. For someone looking for a good cheap one year headset this is the one for you.

B00AMBM9MO|3.0|My wife and I were looking forward to watching this one night once the baby fell asleep. We were both very disappointed in the over all movie.  It seems all of best parts were shown in the previews. We had a prime credit so the movie didn't cost us anything. It seems like this movie was more geared for a younger crowd than my wife and me.

0062127241|3.0|This book is not anywhere near the same caliber as Pete Townsend's brilliant creative work in music and lyrics. While undoubtedly true that he is the only major rock star capable of writing a nuanced book without a ghostwriter, there is little doubt he could have benefited from one. This book is often heavy lifting. It is probably only because I saw the Who during their Live at Leeds era show, when they shared all the power and the glory one could ever ask for (and made your ears ring for days afterwards as if penance for the pleasure) that I even got through this book. I understand it is terribly difficult to explain a creative process, and his efforts to do so are interesting, and he does a better job than most. But his emotions are deeply held in check here, and we only occasionally get a drift of what he was really feeling, where all the violence that he expressed in his performances came from.<br /><br />A music performance comment: In the book, Townsend says probably his greatest career mistake was ordering the destruction of all the tapes of the live shows in the months leading up to the two concert recordings from which Live at Leeds was mixed. I can only smile, having seen one of those shows. I think it was like watching Beethoven play and conduct, or hearing Shakespeare read his own sonnets. Pete, wherever you are, you did the shows and the pleasure will never be forgotten. It was the absolute pinnacle of rock music, and maybe of any kind of live performance in any medium, and the visuals were a match for the sounds.
1426308469|4.0|I like this book, although I wish it had some kind of index for time period/size/etc. It seems to be missing some dinosaurs (has only land ones- aren't there water critters too?), but for the most part it covers the important ones (T-rex, triceratops and cousins, most of the dinos you see on &#34;Dino Dan&#34;). Appropriate for younger kids, I'd say 2 and up, though don't expect them to sit still to be read much of the text.

0451232852|5.0|I was always a bit afraid of Ken Follett's books. They're incredibly long, and I worried about whether I had what it took to finish them. However, with so many people loving them, I finally gave one a chance - \\"Fall of Giants\\" - and I'm a new convert. He's incredible.<br /><br />\\"Fall of Giants\\", the first novel in what is being called 'The Century Trilogy', takes place from 1911-1924, though the main action is during World War I, 1914-1918. It revolves around several protagonists, each from a different part of the world. Grigori is a factory worker in St. Petersburg who is frustrated with difficult working conditions; Gus is the younger son of a senator and a junior aide to President Wilson. Earl Fitzherbert runs an estate near Aberowen, Wales, where he lives with his Russian wife, Bea, and his sister, Maud. The siblings are close friends with Walter, a member of the German embassy. Housemaid Ethel works at the estate while her brother, Billy, is a coal miner nearby. As the Great War draws near, each of these people are affected in different, yet similar, ways.<br /><br />Of course, the men must go into the military, and they do so, though on different sides. The women remain at home but not idle; in the absence of men, they take jobs, campaign for women's rights, and keep their respective countries going. As they experience the events of the rise of unions, women's suffrage, the Russian revolution, and the war in general, their lives continue to weave together in interesting ways. By the time the novel ends in 1924, we've come nearly full-circle with some of them, sharing their joys, their heartaches, and watched them mature.<br /><br />I was worried about the sheer number of characters, but Follett introduces them gradually. For the most part, they revolve around Earl Fitzherbert and his family in some way, so these aren't strangers on the street, though some are obviously unknown to others. They live in places like St. Petersburg, Berlin, and Buffalo, and they fight for all sides in the war. Some are eager to fight, others are pacifists. They range through every political ideal, and each of them wants to see a better world, though they disagree about how to make that happen. And every character is well-drawn to the point that you can find something to identify with.<br /><br />This book came to my notice as a \\"Downton Abbey\\" fan, and, to be honest, I can see the parallels, though they were initially released around the same time. It's most likely because they involve the same time period, though \\"Fall of Giants\\" is much larger in scope and story. I loved this book, and I can't wait to read the next one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great product and I just have to get to home and get to the stable.My grandchildren love to feed the horse and I just have fun with the kids.

0060557818|5.0|Yeah, I know. It’s been out for-ev-er. But I just read it. Because I’m slow that way, and my reading list is long and varied. It used to be a British television show, but I’m an American, so I just watched a couple of snippets on YouTube. The book is clearly better. I hope Mr. Gaiman decides to return to the Neverwhere universe someday and tell us more....<br /><br />rest of the review at the link: [...]

Keeps me on the edge of my seat and that is where I like to be with action movies.  Rarely have I felt this way about all three movies in a series.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Every time I download it, I get an error that it did not download correct, tried 3 times then gave up.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|My review  I found this book a fast and wonderful reading experience.  I recommend it as great fun and poignant.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is such a wonder story and done so beautifully. The music is awesome and the story a good one. We are collecting these for us as grandparents. We like them just ourselves and the kids will in a few years, Thanks.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Awesome movie I cannot believe I waited so long to watch this movie.  No wonder it won so many awards!
B000F8O35U|1.0|This movie is one the three best - and I think only best animated movies - produced by Disney in the last years. Beauty and the Beast, and and Aladdin were the others. I was so excited the day this came I put it in. It was dubbed.
B004V71CYQ|4.0|My son wanted to see the Original TRON so he could compare the two movies.  He is 9, and loved love original.  He especially liked comparing the old costumes and graphics.
B00005JM02|5.0|The colors, the love, the silliness -- the sharks!!! It's all great. Again this was during the time when Disney was really still true to Walt and this movie shows it. Would buy and watch anytime!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for book #3!  Great book and can't wait to see what happens next... again couldn't put it down!
B003DZX44I|5.0|We love this movie and this set is great. We do not have blu-ray or a large screen tv yet but we'll have this disc when it's time!! The dvd is as good as ever. The best &#34;recent&#34; Disney was during this time when political correctness had not been slipped in.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia Day made a great Novel with Bared To You!  I thought it was better than 50 Shades of Gray!
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|We loved this since we saw it as kids. Our kids loved it and in a few years our grands will be old enough to really watch it. It is a delightful movie, great music, and Disney as Disney was supposed to be.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I have been waiting for this book, seems like forever.Now that I finally got the chance to finish it, I am still left with questions, which is the reason I gave it four stars. The book it self was awesome! However, this is the  last book and I was expecting more. I am not going to lie and say I am not disappointed, because I am. The trilogy deserved a epilogue, a closer not just for the character but fir us fans. Why wait so long a this book, if in the end I'm still left confused. As for the love triangle, it is obvious Lena picked Alex, and for that I'm grateful. However, I am not 100%. I enjoyed Hana's chapters as well. The ending did seemed rushed as well :(. Yes I am disappointed but the book was still good.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Good action and informative about how a computer war could be real.  Makes one think about computer security and the ease of hackers in getting information about someone.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|The plot was interesting and the characters were very unique!  It challenged your emotions - is Dexter a monster or a good man trapped in the trauma of an undisclosed horrific past?  I am already hooked and need to see the entire season!
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I am a fan of mazes and labryths but I am kinda of disappointed with this one. we bought this for my son and he lost interest fast.It is complicated and diffucult to use. The design seems poor.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|It jus a good book did you like spirituality and science.  I miss the two of them mixing this book is a good read.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is a classic movie that is filmed in Italy and has subtitles. I bought it when I was learning Italian, but the story and the acting drew me in and make it a film that I love to watch over and over.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Well written, but the cliff hanger was okay. Don't know if I'll read the next one though. Reminds me of the book 'A Wrinkle in Time'
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very convenient to have the Bible on your Kindle. You can highlight and make notationsn to come back to later
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|This film won 7 Oscars in 1999 including Best Picture.  I don't know what else to add... it is a wonder film.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This may not be DeMille's best book ever, but it is an easy read, and a story written from today's headlines.  Starts slow and builds to a explosive ending.  Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing.
6304696558|5.0|I always liked Goldie Hawn and she did a good job in this movie. She is a good actress and showed it in this movie
B0083EM24C|5.0|Awesome cd. Definite feel good music. Carried away and take a walk are the best tracks on the album! Don't hesitate to purchase!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is sooooooo much fun<br />I love this  game because the graphics and that you r able to compete with other people who love  this  game too
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This part of the book left me hanging so I had to read Part 2. Poor guy. What kind of a life he had. I guess I get it cuz of his mother and how she was.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The puzzles start out very easy and progressively get harder.  Time passes quickly without you noticing.  Great for doctor offices etc.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I didn't like the way the story was told.  Just about control and sex.<br />Not really what I like to read.  I am not into dominance or control.
B003B02O14|4.0|John Grisham has again proved why he is the greatest at legal even though the twist at the end was expected there was hope that it would not be that transparent.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I don't have the Fox channel.  So I ordered the first season through Amazon.  I am glad I did.  I can watch it as often as I like.  And I always can't wait for the new episode.  And I like it that the close-caption feature is available. And my husband is hooked on the series as well.  It will be interesting to see how this all plays out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We are almost done with Season 3, we will be &#34;Jonesing&#34; for Season 4!!  Hope that is comes out soon.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Perfect for keeping everything well organized and available for a quick grab out the door. As long as you don't mind the bulk it's great.
B00785P2QC|2.0|It's fun to play but the game takes too long to reload. Other than that it's ok if your bored and have like five min. Free
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this as a kid and love it even more now that I'm an adult and I can pick up on the more subtle mind games that Ender must endure to become the leader the world needs. This book keeps you guessing &#34;how will this child cope? How can he adapt as his environment is made more and more hostile?&#34;
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I liked the show, it was lighthearted and enjoyable to watch this saturday afternoon.  It's a feel good movie about remembering your roots, even when the grass looks greener on the other side.  Plus you have to love the cast!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I hated some of the things that happened at the end but it was a good kind of hate most of it was exciting and it pulls you right in from the beginning.
6305428352|5.0|I was so happy to find this movie on DVD.  This is an awesome movie, a must see for all.
B00874T02K|5.0|it's day two and I'm feeling it. I love having the reminders. I work nights so it's usually hard for me to get exercise in.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game it Is so cool and exciting I love it when I get the next level  cool
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It's a fun game that is a bit challenging as well.  Download it and give it angry, you won't be disappointed.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is awsome. No need to buy an alarm clock download it and you can set alarms for diffrent days, and times. Get this app. The full version allows your own music to alarm you
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Spoiler Free<br /><br />I really enjoyed The Name of the Wind and was a little apprehensive as to whether the second in the trilogy could maintain the quality of the world. Happily, for me at least, I found myself enjoying Kvothe's adventures, highs and lows more than I did in the first. The primary cast is, again, reasonably small - however Rothfuss has an ability to create engaging secondary characters that help flesh out the world and provide layers that make this a far more believable than most of the 'young magician goes to school and seeks destiny' novels out there.<br /><br />I'm still a little wary of the framing device for the novels, however as we've still got the third to come I'll reserve judgement. I am very keen to see how everything pans out. There's been a bit of internet chatter around the delays involved in getting this third out (although I haven't seen anything as vitriolic as what GRRM has received) - providing Rothfuss continues to weave this engaging tale I'll happily wait for as long as it takes for him to be satisfied with what he's accomplished.<br /><br />I'd rate this as being better than Magician, and more engaging than The Malazan Book of the Fallen (which I adored).<br /><br />Verdict: If you liked The Name of the Wind - buy it. If you haven't read The Name of the Wind and you enjoy Fantasy, buy that first, then buy this.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|It is a very practical tool for mounting small camcorders, offers many possibilities for field recording by placing the light at the top make very good images at night because everything will always be visible.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|It is an interesting spin to a very famous Fairy Tale. Unlike the modern Red Riding hood the ending falls flat on its face we are lead to believe the that Snow White untrained in the art of mideveal warfare can lead an army to storm the castle
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun to play even as an adult I enjoy it. I loved horses as a kid and raised some and its realistic.
B000H305U0|3.0|This is hard to listen to, other than &#34;What goes around comes around&#34;  and another song, most of the tracks sound like ganster rap. Had the band  stayed with a more ballad format they may had have something. This will not be on my MP player. YOOO Dudes LESS RAP MORE VOCALS!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awsome but getting keys are hard nut not impossible I love this game u should also.get minion rush that is my favorite game u. Should get it to u will love it.especially if u loved the.movie by the way the movie was amazing!!!!!!lobe these games!!!!!-!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is great of young and old alike.  Adventure but not too complicated for younger players.  I'm 56 and am enjoying it immensly!
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Smartest, creative tower defense.  Zombie routes vary. Guns vary. Builds nicely from easy to &quot;insane.&quot;  My favorite for months now, by far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a very fun game every since we  downloaded this game we have all been going against  one another
B005FFW46S|5.0|Sir Terry is at the top of his game. Witty, exciting, and deeply insightful. But it would be best if you got to know Sam Vimes from some of the earlier books first, especially Thud!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album has been playing in my car nonstop. I love it, you can sing along, and most of their songs are recognizable now
0143117009|5.0|Jared Diamond opens your eyes to the sequence of human events, past and present, that have led to the collapse of societies and their environment.
B00B0NDF26|4.0|It's nice to hear something new that sounds smooth and catchy. Very upbeat music. I wish there were more bands out there like this
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Love this unit. It has taken me to the next level in my audio recordings for sure. If you are a musician who wants great quality sound in a budget this is the solution.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pintrest!  Having an app for it makes access so much easier!  I think it's much better than accessing it through the website.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is the best app ever you get to work as a hair stylist. You get to decorate the hair any way you want you can curl, and straighten
B009KS4XRO|5.0|There is a lot on this app...so understanding it takes some time.  BUT...in the mean time you can enjoy playing a game of bingo where there is more than one winner!
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|This movie had no plot twists at all.  It is just a retelling of the boogie man story.  Do not waste your money.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's fun for kids and up but, I think the price should be lowered a little to<br />3.00$ or something like that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun and great time spender. it has amazing graphics as well!!! I love this app. I recommend it to all horse lover's!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it I get on it all the time. it is like my life. it is so so so so awesome. rember to follow me mckenna aubuchon
B008M721MS|1.0|I have never had problems with Skype until using this app. Random shut downs on mine and my husband's end (ipad 2), freezing, and blackout/muted moments. I was excited to be able to talk to my husband who is over seas but Skype makes it so frustraing and at times impossible to video or even simply to voice chat. I thought maybe it was the distance but have tried local with just as many problems. I wish there was a solid alternative.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This has helped me a lot on coding things in for my Update videos.<br />Thank you so much for whoever made this app. Ultimate Gamers Peace!
B002Q4GIKE|1.0|This was unacceptable as a DVD.  None of the verbals were heard.  I saw the original movie and even had it at one time on a VCR.  So I know what was missing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this ga.e is so fun and u learn how to do certain stuff and still have the quality of a video game and or game
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I like creepy flms, but not chainsaw type or the really mind twisting 'Saw' films.  Carnage is good if it shows imagination not just blood flying.  This film showed that sort of imagination.  I would recommend this film along with 'Insidious'.  Both films left me with the creeps.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first I didn't know if i would like this game. By two minutes of playing I took back what I said. It's an awesome game.
B00065MDRW|4.0|First off, in the title above &#34;rock&#34; is in quotes for a reason, this is not Rock, this is one of those groups that got the &#34;after midnight&#34; play on the progressive stations.  Get a few guys together and stretch what's being done and try some new sounds.  Personally I like it at times other times it bores me stiff.  A real good artist to put in your MP3 player for those times you're in the mood and a must have for those of us who have fond memories of getting silly and turning it up after midnight.
B007SGM084|5.0|Buying the trilogy was the best idea, and I'm so glad Amazon offers it. The three books were all-in-one e-book so once I finished the first, the next one began immediately. Not to mention, each book was much cheaper buying this way- in bulk. Plus, if you try the \\"Sample\\" and like it, you might as well just but all the trilogy, because TRUST ME these books are addicting and you will absolutely want to keep reading. The first book is more provocative, the second was more suspenseful, the third is more romance... I wouldn't classify the trilogy as a great literary classic by any means, however for entertainment and romance, this trilogy gets a 10/10 from me.
0810970686|5.0|Got this for my sons (who are 9 and 11) and they were so excited when it came in the mail! Had a few stains on it but we were warned and he is very happy.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a John Grisham fan and have read all of his books. This one drags a bit and although the plot is ok, it did not hold my attention. I look forward to his next one, though.
0446582778|4.0|could not put down looking forward for more bosch books. would like to see more paperback additions or more in books as a set.
1423107233|1.0|The book looks great; BUT the problem is that I have received both my original order with damaged inside spine and now the replacement has the same defect.<br />I am returning both, but until someone gets the quality issue with the spines resolved, buyer beware.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the costumes, the music, the castle, the characters, everything about this show. The dialogue is clever and sharp (especially literally every word that escapes Maggie Smith's mouth) and there's plenty of drama. My favorite thing about this series is just how beautiful everything is to look at. The lighting, camera work, props, and costumes conspire to make this a visual treat.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Video did not work well, stopped mid way and would not restart. Really 8 more words required, not much else to say
B0084670FU|1.0|Too many hopeless and joyless scenes. Was not deep enough for insight into the human experience. Not even entertaining, though very well acted..
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This story is like a tapestry. 's. Morton took three stories and weaved them into one. The Times and voices change, but the story is one.  There is adventure, mystery, fantasy, and romance...really great book.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I am using the app with my Kindle Fire to read Epub books along with Aldiko.<br />I lave not used it long but it seems to work fine.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I became a &#34;late&#34; fan of Downton Abbey.  Therefore, I had to watch the earlier seasons.  The benefit of being a Prime Member enabled me to watch Season two on my computer.  This season was one of the best and I had my tissues at the ready. The picture and sound were perfect.  I am so happy I became a Prime Member on so many levels and would recommend it to all Amazon lovers.  Also, I really loved this season of Downton Abbey.
0345529057|5.0|Totally worth it. Read all of them. They are such awesome books! Great for a gift or if you just plain want the series and don't want to spend an arm and a leg!
B007P6VM04|5.0|Excellent music if you like Broadway and musicals.  This is good listening music and if you enjoy the TV show this is for you.
0399160450|5.0|Clancy hit another one out of the Park with this book from beginning to end it does not stop. When does the next book come out hopefully soon.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|About a decade ago, a TiVo entered our household for the first time.  (We have 4 TiVo units now, since you asked.) One day this TiVo had a link appear where we could listen to streamed music.  And this TiVo streamed two bands to us that forever became a part of our music repertoire:  [[ASIN:B001NCM98U Keane]] and [[ASIN:B000W00G7K Snow Patrol]].  They have long since stopped streaming music to that first TiVo box, but the historical significance remains.<br /><br />No one is quite like Keane in the music arena in my opinion.  After 7 months with this album, I can also agree with others that it continues the band's core and progression.<br /><br />Strangeland contains 'Sovereign Light Cafe,' 'Neon River,' and 'In Your Own Time' which each equal the caliber of earlier songs like 'Somewhere Only We Know,' 'Your Eyes Open,' 'She Has No Time,' and 'Bedshaped.'  And that is just comparing songs from [[ASIN:B001NCM98U Hopes and Fears]], and doesn't count the other songs on Strangeland that are enthralling.<br /><br />The point is that \\"it\\" is all there.  Everything that makes Keane wonderful.  Soothing, insightful, lows-and-highs of love.  A fantastic album.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|What can I say, this movie is one that is worth watching over and over again. I had almost lost hope of getting it for a decent price as it was an exclusive release with Pioneer. Ebay offers were through the roof with price gouging. Watching this in 3d is outstanding.
B003TNM2K6|3.0|Modern day type of the old movies like \\"the giant ....\\" fill in the blank<br />Save this for when you are out of things to watch :-/<br />My rating is: better then nothing....lol
B000UD0ESA|5.0|This is the final version Ridley Scott really wanted the public to see. Don't by the &#34;Director's Cut&#34; because the director had nothing to do with it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I found the characters difficult to empathize with...I kept waiting for some redemptive behavior with these kids and adults alike...I had to keep reading it because I was sure the story would end with turning all these mean, petty, selfish, bullying, weak  and deeply flawed personalities into somewhat kind and nice people.......So much for that idea!!!  With that being said, I couldn't put the book down....
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game us so fun and addicting recommend for all ages.love how you can actually drive to save the animals
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is so much fun at night you buy items throughout the night they build them self's so when you wake up its there and ready. + it give you a brake to play other games or do something else while waiting.  :)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game puts the &quot;joy &quot; in &quot;joyride &quot;. I love it. I play it on my kindle  and android. Must get +its free.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this book to be interesting and touching all at the same time. Alexander makes an almost unbelievable event, believable.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|An absolute page turner for adults. Must read, if you are a fan of NOT just fantasy but of good literature in general.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I'm on  of those people who doesn't always get into books, but every time I read John Green book, I'm glued to it. I might be really young by  I loved  every second and cried a lot
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I got this for my daughter and she LOVED it! She watches it over and over and over again, well worth the money to make her happy
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|5th prestige k/d: 1.52 and I usually get 20-24 kills my game name is danwsdad and I luv this game because it has really good multiplier maps new exciting weopons and campiegn were u can play on both sides but just watch out for in multiplier lets say u have $47,000 and then u play a match then at the end of the match u might have $31,000 but overall great game and I'm hoping gameloft will fix that with a update but until then I cant wait to start playin again!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A story very intense and real. Suspenseful to the very end. Very well written and acted. One of my favorite movies.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I downloaded the game I let it load 10 times and it didn't let me play the game so I deleted it
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I really loved the book it was hard to put it down at times and always wanted to know what would happen next. At first the way the story was written confused me but once I realized the author was alternating from the main characters past and present it just got better and better a nice climax and no bored spots or plateau, the book is based on a dangerous relationship in which she is abused and harmed and the fear afterwards of living with her past and then her ex gets out of jail to find her and finish the job, this was a great book!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I found the book really discouraging.  I hold the belief that perseverance pays off and there are silver linings if you just look for them.  I felt like the moral of this story was that life sucks for most people so just live with that truth.  I was very disturbed by it.  Also, I heard it was about bi-polar which I now am learning about and instead this was about trauma induced amnesia and just general family dysfunction.  Yuck.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best shows out there to date, so much drama, so many shocking moments.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat
1451696205|5.0|I love this product and it is an item that I recommended people buying. This was definitely the site to make the purchase.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|IF you are not a professional writter please stop hating on these films. People com pain and complain. THere won't be much new releases. This movie at times had horrible acting, but at other times it was exceptionally well done and thought out. THe ladies sometimes don't fit in but hte whole plotline in general was brilliant. I thought it was inception with a twist. I would rate this film 5/5 because it's too low, and people are too harsh on this film in general.<br /><br />I enjoyed the plotline, because there's a lot of parts where you are wondering if he's in the real world, what he's doing, and watching the whole movie is a brain twister. I was engaged in the whole movie. Perhaps this is why people hate the filmd. They just want to sit on their bums and watch a movie that has a lot of killing and a lot of cuss words as well as f-bombs. There may be a few in here, but not exactly what you are looking for. I would not say there's a whole lot of death in this film because it's pg-13. It's funny how the main head lady Lori Quaid, or Melinda keep fighting over the main character. It's intense although at times overly much.<br /><br />I found that the film needs a second chance for a sequel perhaps with a little bit of more open ground, and hosting someone else besides the main character. Maybe he'll make a cameo, but the storyline should be around someone else like one of the secondary characters' or a Prequel. There's too much wasted potential here.
1878424319|5.0|I love this product and it is an item that I recommended people buying. This was definitely the site to make the purchase.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I don't like these kind of games.  They are not what I want.  Sooooo please don't publish anymore.  Can't believe so much time has been put into making a game like this.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a really cool game for kids. I'd probably like it too if I were into games and stuff but I have 3 kids so not much time for that!
B007SGM084|1.0|It was a poor text trying to be interesting and ending in a silly love story. Definitively not what I specter
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Happy but Gossip Girls season 6 was not worth buying but my son had to get the last one I am glade it is the last One as for as the Seller every thing was great
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is cute and fun to play<br /><br />It almost feel as like having your own horse. I do think that it should cost less coins to buy other horses though...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is so nice to be able to pull my phone out of my pocket and read my book while waiting in line or sitting in a traffic jam.  I love having access to it so easily.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|My very favorite Michael Douglas film.  Robert Duvall also has an exceptional performance in this film.  It also arrived very quickly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played in my whole entire life. If they come out with subway surfers two I'm so getting it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Really like the colors and how easy it is to use. Needed to take notes at church & had no notebook. It quickly installed & was ready for use.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Good game that helps to pass the time. Newer version in the android play store but that one is full of ads.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Wonderfully story. Well written and emotional. Provides a deep understanding of North Korea, mind control, love, hope, dispare and our natural ability to avoid the truth.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Mildly surprised with it, I managed to see nostalgia and feel the sub plots, and the little guys like the action and color variations.
0812550706|5.0|I read this as a teenager and it stands today as one of my favorites. Recommended for kids and adults, the character development and plot twists create a real page turner.<br /><br />The story is about a group of kids sent to \\"battle school\\" to prepare for the expected second attack of an insectoid race of aliens. Highly recommended.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Because i have seen it at the movies in France last December and I liked it so when it finally got into the English version I could show it to my family here.
B008220D7S|2.0|Like a lot of things that were good in small doses (Jeff Goldblum springing into the lead role in \\"The Lost World\\" being one of them), Judd Apatow's decision to spin the scene-stealing coupling of Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann from \\"Knocked Up\\" into their own film is a near-total misfire.<br /><br />An aimless - and interminably long - comedic-drama that falls in line with Apatow's increasingly unsatisfying recent fare, \\"This is 40\\" follows Rudd and Mann as both hit the 40 milestone, trying to work through all kinds of issues both big and small in their lives in Southern California. In fact, Apatow spends the first hour populating his original script with an endless succession of self-contained scenes with the couple sparring over finances, Rudd's father (Albert Brooks), their kids' preoccupation with electronic devices, and lack of sexual spark. Eventually \\"drama\\" kicks in when Mann learns she's pregnant again and Rudd's latest record fails to generate sales - but outside of a Melissa McCarthy cameo, nearly all of \\"This is 40\\" just sits there and dies on-screen. Rudd and Mann are both likeable performers, but their endless complaining in the film grates after just a few minutes -- I'm sure Apatow thought this would bring an \\"authentic\\" element to the film, but there end up being so many issues involving their relationship, and their respective parents, that it's hard to understand why this couple is together at all. Ultimately \\"This is 40\\" is as annoying and obnoxious as the behavior of its lead characters, and leaves you feeling as if you've actually spent 40 years in their company.<br /><br />Universal's Blu-Ray release of \\"This is 40\\" includes both the original R-rated theatrical cut and an unrated version featuring an additional three minutes. The 1080p transfer and DTS MA soundtrack are both fine. Extensive extras include more deleted, extended, and alternate scenes, a gag reel, commentary, interviews, featurettes, a DVD and digital copy (both itunes and Ultraviolet).
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Great story line. Movie is very funny and romantic. But there is nudity(but I didn't mind). Everyone should see it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would encourage anyone to watch Downton Abbey.  I enjoyed it very much. The development of the characters as the episodes progress leaves the audience wondering what will happen next to the family.
B0019M2ITY|5.0|hello excellent article, packed all my expectations, an unused item with great quality and finish, the service was very warm and Rapides, and recommend it when I can buy more, I give you my word these people know what it does, buy here. ..!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this alarm clock! It wakes me up when I need to everyday and if I need to hurry out, it tells me what the weather is like in my area(incase I need a jacket). I recommend this to everyone.
B007THA4FI|2.0|After having enjoyed all the Harry Potter books, I expected characters whom I would appreciate.  I found the book depressing in its dealing with what I hope are the baser aspects of life.
044024157X|5.0|I love John Grisham the author!  I am a loyal fan and read all his books!  Can't wait to read more!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|A very good season.  This is a series that does the short and long term plots very well.  I would recommend the Fringe series.
0399230033|5.0|My child loves this book!  I wont bother repeating all the great things other Reviewers said about this book.  I agree with all the other 5 star reviews.  I highly recommend this book.

B009NPA3Y6|5.0|i have a lot of these on other anthologies but it is always fun to hear songs in new sequences
B003VANOFY|5.0|Got these headphones mainly for gaming and now i can hear my enemies footsteps across the map which really helps me plan out my attack. Also i can hear exactly what direction they're firing from! I am 110% pleased with these they are insanely good headphones and they are definitely worth the $!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I really like this little game.<br />There are a lot of levels to keep you busy in this one.<br /><br />I tend to like Time Management games (I play all of the Roads to Rome games on my PC) and this was perfect for the Kindle Fire.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I hate this app,it is SO slow I had to wait 1 -1/2 days!I recommend not to get this app!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I adore this game. I had to stop at one point because I couldn't stop thinking about it and wanted to use Excel to create my own.<br />I have seen kids enjoy the easier levels and I love the full range of the levels. There are also more of the middle-range boards (8x8 and 9x9), which is nice.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I played this on my friend Emma's  I pod and it was free!but still fun you shold try it.<br />  P.S<br />  this is on the kindle fire :)
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Hope Springs was a very slow movie and for Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones movie was almost right down boring.  I get the situation of the movie cause I'm sure it happens with relationship's, but the movie just was to so.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so hooked on this book I was reading while pouring my coffee in the morning.  If you read the 1st book you have to read this one too.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is legit. When it's day it's all black and white.You always have a sinking feeling that you're not alone. I love this game.
B00BHMF578|4.0|My husband and I didn't trust that this would be a good movie despite the Oscar but we both loved it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is ok, but I would rather have it with more power ups<br />Also, the coins don't spin like in other devices like Apple phones.<br />Another thing is that there are things on trains you cannot reach<br />because there should be a power up or cart to help you reach it
B003E2UQMS|5.0|One of the best book I´ve read recently.  Makes you thing a lot about relashionship and how you deal with the chalanges you face in a lifetime . Amazing !!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is very sad, and I wish the ending would have been longer. The letter at the end made me cry.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love is probably the strongest and hardest feeling a person can have. I think this book brought out every possible emotion (and tears). I didn't want to put it down for a second. Beautifully written.
1616550414|5.0|It exceeded all my expectations. The book is really amazing, it has many details about the development of all The Legend of Zelda main games, beautiful artworks and an interesting manga with the events before Skyward Sword.<br />I highly recommend it to all gamers and especially to Zelda fans.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I have been looking to achive 'Keto Adaptation(NK)' . I was able to do so in 3 weeks following this and this:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/The-Science-Carbohydrate-Performance-ebook/dp/B008BYG7RW/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1<br /><br />book; worked nicely. They complement each other.<br /><br />It is very easy to overdo the Protein and not reach 'NK'. One has to follow the books directions closely, at least in the earlier weeks.<br /><br />Happy with the results and outcomes.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Just a fantastic historical film. Makes  you reflect on what this country stood for and how far we have strayed from the original intent of the government.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game.....I play it on kindle all day long, no problems....very addicting, I like how u can play against friends
1602830452|4.0|I'm going to keep this in a simple pros vs cons format, since that is what I find most helpful myself.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-FANTASTIC voice acting.<br />-Thoroughly immersive.<br />-Quality sound effects.<br />-Sherlock Holmes feels like the actual literary Sherlock Holmes.<br />-Clearly labeled CDs<br />-CDs long enough so swapping CDs at the end of a tale isn't a constant inconvenience.<br />-A complete collection<br />-The dramatization faithfully includes all of the major plot elements.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Not a direct reading of the original story (it is a character interaction based dramatization)<br />-Sometimes, early on in the stories, this form of dramatization without much narrative explanation makes characters difficult to distinguish.<br /><br />If I were a more generous fellow, I would give 5 stars, but I feel I must be honest. This is a damned good way to shorten a commute or a long drive. At the same time, for me at least, the first half of the first story can be confusing for a first time Holmes listener, as one would still be unfamiliar with the voice acting.<br /><br />Give it time- and as long as you are okay with listening to an adaptation and not a word for word recitation of the original stories, you should find this CD set to be exactly what you need.<br /><br />I have been late to my obligations a number of times because I've been sitting in my car waiting for a good stopping point.<br /><br />A worthy purchase for any Sherlock Holmes fan.
B008476HBM|5.0|You can't beat Jane Austen for telling an intriguing story. There is a good reason this novel is a classic. The characters are believable and their actions compelling. I am an English AP teacher, and teach this novel for the witty dialogue and vivid period depiction.
B000KIPD5E|5.0|Behringer doesn't always give full specs (surprise!). There is NO MENTION ANYWHERE, not in the manual or on the website that the adjustment knobs are more than just potentiometers. They are actually two very high quality mini amps that allow you to control the output level of your instrument; not just cut, but gain too! The 9 volt battery is NOT just for the LEDs, it is driving two mini preamps.<br /><br />I inserted a fixed signal (440kHz) to the input of my DAW WITHOUT the AB100 and set the DAW level meter to 0db. Then I sent the same signal through the AB100 to the DAW. Much to my surprise I found that when the AB100 pots are set straight up, the input signal outputs unity (signal in = signal out). When I set the pot to 9 o'clock, signal out was cut by -12db, fully counterclockwise (\\"min\\" on the pot label) cut the out signal by -24db. Then I got a big surprise, when I went PAST center to \\"Max\\" on the pot I actually got a +6db BOOST! Why doesn't Behringer describe this wonderful feature in its spec sheet? And the A/B switches ARE silent, even in a live situation. This is a great pedal. I am thrilled.<br /><br />My built-in acoustic guitar preamp always outputs so hot that the sound guy has to max out his trimmer or add -20db of padding to the DI. This guitar has no volume adjustments so I was looking for some external attenuator to control my levels. By using the AB100 I can dial in a PERFECT CLEAN LEVEL for the sound guy AND have two separate outputs, output A can be set for clean rockin' or even overdriven (+6db) lead riffs while B can be set for solid distortion-free rhythm. This pedal is now a permanent part of my guitar setup.<br /><br />No distortion, perfect levels, great price. I (and the sound guy) couldn't be happier.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I liked the movie but it jumped from parts to parts because the CD was scratched up. So I missed parts of the movie an I could barely see the extra on it cuz  of the scratch ups on the CD and it was a new CD.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was never was a big fan of master piece theater until I started watching this following a Cobert Bump.
B0089LOKHG|1.0|Nothing in this book is resolved.  It is possibly the worst ending to a story I have ever encountered.<br /><br />The author had such a great concept for a story in the first two books.  The third resolves none of the issues the predecessors had built up.<br /><br />If this were an installment with another book in the works, maybe it would rate 3 stars.  Unfortunately, this is being advertised and the finale.  I wish I could get all of my money and time refunded for this kind of a let down.<br /><br />I put up with 3 books of sub-par writing for this?  I have been completely turned off by this fledgling author, and I will not be purchasing any of her books in the future.  Horrible.<br /><br />***Spoilers*****<br /><br />Nothing about the revolution is resolved other than the resistance taking down one city.  The love story of Lena, Alex and Julian is left COMPLETELY unresolved.  What happens to Hana?  Where is Lena's family?<br /><br />Ugh!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I downloaded it and  I didn't really get much a chance to make it work on my kindle so maybe I'm not the judge of this game.  I then deleted it because I couldn't get it to work.  But I do love games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is wonderful.  There are many reading plans,  notes can be taken,  and passages can be highlighted in color codes.
0062238868|4.0|Would recommend to anyone who has an interest in an overview of the inner workings of one of the most elite groups of Military in the history of the US. Not an overly engaging read, it does have it's moments.
0131177052|5.0|It's almost 50 years of large-scale software development and you still will not get the knowledge contained in this book from anywhere else. If you're a developer, just go and buy or borrow and read it immediately.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This application is great and great graphics easy to use and I wish there were a easeyer way to get gems:B
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Okay great read & Elena she deserved every bit of what she got!!! Don't want to tell to much,,,, for you New readers, but u should b reading this one NOW!!! : )
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|Incredible read loved the series.  Undeniably a very well written an unique series from an author who was not able to finish a flourishing career as a writer
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series.....I envy anyone who has not seen it yet!!!!!!!!  I cannot recommend this enough....do yourself a favor and  get lost with Downton!!!!!!
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I read it in a week... cant wait to see the movie... it so inspiring book, some how i felt identified with her
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I like this because of the story of Rodriguez behind it.  It is very 70's music but it is good to me as I relate to that time.  I wanted to support this artist after watching Searching for Sugar Man.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app, and it's awesome if you love horses, so GET THIS APP!!!! it's so interactive and cute!!:)
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I like this CD because of Rodriguez's story.  Like all of his music, it is very 70's in style but his poetry is awesome.  He deserves some support.  That is part of the reason I ordered his CD's.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This obviously isn't going to be a piece of great cinema, but it's a good movie for what it is, with decent special effects and acting. If you're looking to just sit back and watch gratuitous violence with a dash of plot, you found it.
B006HL9G10|5.0|The app is simple to use and the bells are beautiful. I needed a timer to signal 30-sec intervals while holding a stretch and changing to the next stretch. The bells in the app are so drawn out that one bell has just faded out and the interval bell sounds. They are so soothing; it is easy to relax the muscles during the stretch. I look forward to the exercises because the app is so pleasant to use.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Personally, I've always loved the Aliens series/universe, which is why I wanted to see this movie. But in short, it just sucked all around. The acting was bad, the plot was worse. A lot of this movie just didn't make any sense, as bad I wanted it to. I would give you long list of all the bad in this movie(it's a long list), but I'm not the type to drop spoilers on people. Just trust me and don't bother. If you really have to see it, wait until it's free to stream. Spending even $2 to watch this movie would be a ripoff. The only reason I didn't give it a one star rating is because I'm just too damn nice.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|How an author can come up with such ideas in head is pretty scary. I can't to read Dark Places. I didn't care for the ending of Gone Girl.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This is one of the better bond movies to come out recently. The performances are solid, the plot is okay(could have been better, in my opinion), and really gives you a 'real spy' feel to it. Get out the popcorn, sit back, and enjoy. And if you're a fan of the James Bond movies of old you'll probably enjoy it even more for the nostalgia factor. A worthwhile watch!
B006TKP2B2|4.0|This book presents a very thought provoking Vision of the future. It shows us what the world could be like if we don't address some of the concerns we face today such as our dependence on oil. In order to consume this vision, the reader must quickly come up to speed on a wide variety of new terminology. There are new terms specific to the challenges of this new world, and a lot of Thai and Chinese phrases are thrown in on top of that. The first few chapters are especially slow reading as you invest the time in learning your new vocabulary words.<br />Once you get past the vocabulary, there is a new challenge. You have to get past some very graphic descriptions of abuse against one of the characters. This abuse is an essential part of the plot but its still tough reading.<br />Once I got through that &#34;investment&#34; in reading, I found myself hooked on the plot. I really wanted to know whether these characters would find a new path to carry society forward and I wondered what the next iteration of the world would be.<br />The story also got me thinking about which side would I take in this conflict. The author has woven a complex vision that carries with it a set of complex problems to consider.<br />All in all, I'm glad I read the book, but I know others who were not willing to make the investment required to get through it. It's not a light summer read.  It's a thought provoking read for the reader who is up for a challenge and eager to explore the problems of a possible complex future and consider how to (and whether to) try to avoid allowing this future to become reality.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The God's must have made this app because it woke me up after I took some heavy duty sleeping pills.  I highly recommend it<br /><br />  BOB HAS SPOKEN
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Not gonna lie, this book took me a while to get into. The beginning is kind of slow and a little dull, but it slowly gains momentum. About a third of the way into the book things really get good. So give this book a chance, it might start slow but it turned out to be fantastic.<br /><br />The characters in this book are great. I love the main character's bad jokes and silly puns, it's the kind of humor you expect an old man to have. The supporting characters are also fantastic. I loved Alan and his explanation of physics related things.<br /><br />If I have one issue here it's with the explanation of skip drives and how they travel through space. I know it's a sci-if book, but I felt that how skip drive technology would work was a little sketchy. It just didn't make a whole lot of sense. I know that I'm being vague, but I don't want to give up any plot information.<br /><br />Overall it's a great book and I can't wait to read the next one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This one was fun and cute and sweet and romantic.  Great escapism.  Nothing deep, but who wants that anyway:)  Perfect for the beach or a weekend away or a night with no good tv on.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|A  little hard to follow at some points but a gripping tale of self certification, murder, and character development.  I would watch it again.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This App works great on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I also downloaded it to my laptop and Kindle Fire 7&#34;. On these devices the App doesn't keep track of wins correctly and depending upon the puzzle you can't see much of the top row. Hard to play without it.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I was lucky enough to get this game for free but I would say it is definetly worth a dollar. this game is isn't a going to make u wanna throw ur device away from u scary but more like a &quot;wtf just happened&quot; or &quot;he just came from nowhere&quot; scary. worth playing if fan of slendy, scathe games, or just bored and want something to play.<br /><br />Ps. if u want to make the game scarier change the difficulty setting (duh) or add fog/image enhanced thing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual city is a SIM City lite for the kindle.  Except for the busy graphics, this game very enjoyable.<br /> Be prepared to spend hours on it.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|One of the best and most real books I've ever read, it's defiantly a must-read. Overall it has to be my favorite book.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|I bought this application as a lark, but over the months I found it useful and enjoyable.  I'm glad I bought it.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|At the age of 75, Dustin Hoffman appears to be looking for a second career as a director.  And from the look and feel of this, his first attempt, he should have some success.  The film centers on a retirement home in pastoral England, established for aging musicians, classical musicians specifically.  Four residents in particular drive the story.<br /><br />Reggie (Tom Courtenay) and Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins) are soon joined by a true opera star, Jean Horton (Maggie Smith) who was once part of their quartet and had a brief marriage to Reggie.  Years earlier with her career about to take off, she left the group and her husband and never looked back.  Reggie in particular isn't about to reconcile.  Michael Gambon also stars as Cedric who fancies himself as a producer/director and is putting together a live performance with the residents.  You know, to make money and save the home from possibly closing.<br /><br />Like this plot gimmick, \\"Quartet\\" doesn't break any new ground and is predictable to a fault.  At the same time the film is light hearted, funny and contains some spirited dialog, most of which belongs to Wilf.  There's also a nice scene when Reggie has a group of teens over for a lecture of sorts.  He gets into an exchange with a young man about the differences between opera and rap music.  Entertaining and insightful as is the whole movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I give it one star because it wasnt at all what I was expecting.Its a supid girls dormitory type of story and will not appeal to men like us at all
0374532575|4.0|Franzen writes beautifully.  Unfortunately, he seems to know this and is quite verbose.  I did enjoy the book, even though I think that it could have been more succinct.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The first 50% of this book is for teens. It doesn't start to get interesting until about three quarters of the way through with mostly predictable events occurring.<br />The author repeats herself - if she can say it 50 ways instead of one, she does. I really cannot recommend this book - way too much sex for teens or YA to read, and not \\"adult\\" enough for more mature readers. I'm shocked at how popular this book is, but more power to the author for making it happen. Luckily I Kindled this either for free or 99cents. Not worth more. The cover is quite nice and I liked the characters in the beginning; thus the 2**.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app is tons of fun. Reminds me of the token game at chucky cheese just a whole lot easier to win.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|This album is quite good.  Shrine of New Generation Slaves (SONGS, lol) doesn't have a bad song on it.  I would say that it fits somewhere between Riverside's Anno Domini High Definition (ADHD, lol) and Rapid eye movement in terms of heaviness.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I've found this game fun and easy to play. Also doing the missions, levelling up and earning buck's are easy an quicker than a lot of other similar games.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Like the sound effects but the game doesn't make much sense to me. Like the bad guy looks like the silence from doctor who.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|No worries with this lens cap.  As advertised, it opens and closes automatically.  Makes my new Olympus camera super convenient to use.  Highly recommended.
1612183956|5.0|I have read half a dozen of Blake Crouch's novels -- this was my first read and my favorite.  The book was face paced, and the character's were very realistic.  Very enjoyable read.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|So glad I read this book.  We as Americans are so blessed that our military are willing to die to ensure our safety and freedoms.  This was at times difficult to read.  It was a first-hand account of a SEAL and what he was involved in and witnessed.  My heart goes out to his wife and children.  May they find comfort in knowing he was a Christian.  He served his country well.
B008BZIUHG|1.0|this band is not very good and the cd is absolutely horrible. The volume is brick-walled and an over-emphasized bloated bottom end make it un-listenable. Hands down the worst recording I have ever heard. Sounds like Led Zeppelin...please. On it's way to the cd exchange store for credit. My sound system, if you are listening to this, I am sure it can hang.<br />Other purchases in the last 10 days,  People,Hell and Angels, Vintage Trouble (bomb shelter), Queen Rock Montreal dvd, Helen Grimaud Mozart PC No. 19 and No. 23, Ingrid Filter Beethoven - Chopin, Green Day Tre!
B005LAIH4A|2.0|I was pretty disappointed by this movie.  It was slow and the basic plot (the boy trying to plant a tree to impress a girl) was pretty thin.  I did like some of the music and The Lorax himself was pretty cool.  However, this will not go on my list of movies to watch again any time soon.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't beleive the all the hype. This is a sorry book. I never write reviews but I'm so disapointed that I had to write something. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Borrow it from one of us who got sucked in if you have time to waste.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Excellent series!  I really did have trouble putting it down.  I'm a mom of two and when you're a mom of young children, you know sleep is precious and hard to come by...and I stayed up late reading this every night until it was finished, that's how good the series is.  Now, if only Martin would get a move on things and get the last two books in the series written!
B004L9IDD2|4.0|The reason I chose the rating for such an item was because the film was astounding. With the action, mecha genre and humor used.  It beat my expectations of 1.01 and I enjoyed it. The package was perfectly fine and the DVD worked so it was nice.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|If you like his older works this is very much the same. He doesn't disappoint, even though many of these songs have been done multiple times by other artists in the past.
B002361MLA|5.0|The Power of Now<br />Great book, learned quite a bit by reading, will recommend to others for their reading and enlightenment.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|That is all the help you get from the game.<br /><br />To move, use your left thumb, press it on the lower left and slide your thumb a lityle in the direction you want to go.  Use your right hand to just slide your finger any where on the screen, this will change your view.  To pick up a page, just walk up to it.  Beyond that just remember the games help expecially the part about not looking at him.<br /><br />The game has good 3D perspective graphics, like a first person shooter.  The sound effects are nice and moody.  I imagine many will be scared and jump, etc.  I thought it was more boring.  You walk around looking for notes.  The slenderman doesn't chase you so much as he pops up. You can see him, turn around and look again and he is gone.  I could say more about this, but I don't want to ruin the game.<br /><br />For me the game just wasn't fun.  I don't see the replay value.  I do think it does create a moody, scary game for most.  I just wish it was scary because I had a gun with six bullets and I was running out of bullets.  Just wish there was more to do then walk and look for notes.  Even a run mode that you could only use for short periods, or limited amounts.  After all you can only walk and even the game help suggests you should run.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is amazing. The graphics are great. It's really scary because he pops up anywhere and every where<br /><br /> I just played easy mode in daylight and I can't figure out how to get around that house.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Seen the movie several times and enjoy it each time. Bought this Blu-ray and now I can watch it anytime. Great price!
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Homeland, Season 1, won an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series, which sets the bar quite high for viewer satisfaction.  That's the standard from which I began the series and I was somewhat disappointed.  The acting was solid but not incredible.  Claire Danes handled the challenge of Manic Depression in her character interestingly, but not necessarily professionally.  She simply became much more hyperactive when manic and introspectively irritated when depressed.  She represent a CIA agent who wavered between commitment and addiction to her job, a quality that drove her to the correct destination but with several wrong turns along the way.  Damian Lewis' character is inherently intriguing, as a Marine war hero, returning home to his family after years as a prisoner of Al Qaeda, presumed dead by everyone.  While the viewers' curiosity about what happened while he was imprisoned is obvious, it is rivaled by curiosity about how he and his family/friends will adjust to his life at home.  Lewis played the role with a cold flatness at times that seemed that he was either disengaged from the role or leveraging the eeriness of his character's behavior.  Both lead actors did a very good job but neither interpreted the screenplay, which was slightly above average, into masterpieces.  The supporting acting was all quite solid, which seemed to propel the story along its course without considering the relative mediocrity of the writing.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me is how similar the show was - in both look/feel and subject matter - to Showtime's &#34;Sleeper Cell,&#34; which aired in 2005-2006.  Overall, while technology such as camera quality has improved the visual product for most movies and television series, &#34;Homeland&#34; appears to have reaped those benefits of modernization.  Also, while we have the advantage of 6-7 years hindsight and exposure related to how our military and intelligence community manage terrorist activity, &#34;Homeland&#34; uses roughly asimilar set of story lines.  I saw nothing groundbreaking here.  There was nothing in the story that made me feel as though it pushed the envelope in any way.  No characters whose dynamism gripped me from one episode to the next.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;Homeland&#34; seemed successful to me because it satiated my thirst for a long-form espionage thriller, and the plot advanced consistently from pilot to finale, requiring my regular attention.  As media coverage has adjusted to its cycle of weekly consumption and immediate gratification (e.g., web reviews, twitter remarks), &#34;Homeland&#34; became a fixture for 13 weeks of mass consumption.  It did so not necessarily on its own merit, in my opinion, but based on incessant demand for this type of show.  Likewise, I look forward to watching Season 2 (serially, on Instant), not because I expect it to be astounded by its quality, but because I've already invested several hours and like to be entertained by this genre.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I LOVE this series-anticipated watching all of season 2 during the few days following my purchase of a digital movie - really wanted the DVD but in error ord'd. the digital.  Watched the first episode, then the next day went to continue watching and lo and behold I couldn't retrieve it no matter what I tried.  So today I will attempt to locate it at Barnes & Noble and buy the DVD.  My fault entirely-just not tech-savey to say the least.  I keep thinking it's in my computer SOMEWHERE, but I can't wait to see the rest-no matter the extra cost.  Recommend this series highly!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very good character development, story lines, acting.  Some of the drama is a little over the top, but thoroughly entertaining.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I have both really enjoyed this show. The acting, costumes, set, etc. are wonderful. It's a bit soap opera-y, and there are a lot of inaccuracies for thee period, but I still ate it up.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Keep the original in the CD case and have burned it to my computer so I can keep copies in my truck. I love the movie and love the soundtrack. Pour some sugar on me is my favorite!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Amazing is all I can say. I read this book 20 years ago and decided to reread it..I could not put it down...One of the best books I've ever read.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love this product. It's terrific. Several hours of viewing pleasure. I have absolutely no regrets about this purchase at all!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|A story that sticks with you and makes you question perceptions and realities.  Who is &#34;handicapped&#34;, the man trapped in an iron lung or the people trapped in their own iron prejudices. Stellar performances.
B000ZELISO|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with the qualify of this. I saw the movies when they were released so know the story. But the problem with this blue ray DVD is that toward the end, the sound track gets off from the picture. The words spoken and the mouth movements of the actors/characters didn't match. It was slightly off.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this game because really fun,easy to understand,it works,and it`s FREE! I think  you  should buy Temple run 2!It`s not disappointing!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I got hooked on this series from re-runs on TNT. Then I went back and bought each season for my DVD Library. First time I ever bought a series. No Regrets! LOVE IT!
B00881VLCE|1.0|Was a wonderful app until this morning when the biggest puzzle I could do went from 212 piece to 42. Please fix. Then I will re rate it a 5 star.
B003ASLJK4|4.0|I love this movie. It's not for the young adult not because of anything negative, but because you don't really understand and relate to the story until you have lived a bit more. I already have recommended it to another friend I know who uses Amazon!
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I loved this novel. I am usually only a fan of contemporary novels, but in an attempt to broaden my mind and views, i am reading a lot kf classic novels. Bram Stoker had quite the imagination and wrote a great book. My preconceptions about Dracula were thrown out the window by the end. Though I won't ruin any surprises by saying whether I sympathize with Dracula or whether I feel he's guilty and not as innocent as previously thought, but i will say this novel is well worth the read.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Love the series. Although not as good as the books, adaptations seldom are. For other purists out there, beware of the Danaries plot trajectory - it is extremely different from the books.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I have uninstalled the game and re installed it but it will play for little bite and then shut off. then it wont load anymoe
1401940676|5.0|Anita's message was very affirming for me because it is my truth as well.  After attending a traditional church for the first 50 years of my life, I finally found my true spiritual home at the Pittsburgh Center for Spiritual Living, and the wisdom taught there is basically the same as what Anita discovered during her NDE - with a few minor exceptions.  It was wonderful to hear her repeatedly emphasize that we are all connected as one - this message has changed my life dramatically.<br /><br />I also needed to be reminded that this pertains to ALL souls - even those who hurt others.  Just prior to learning about Anita's book, our family went through a very difficult time.  My daughter shared that her fiance (ex now) had been physically and emotionally abusing her for eight months - all the while we were planning a fall wedding.  He terrorized her by threatening to kill our entire family if she told us about the abuse or didn't comply with his demands.  After we had rescued and helped her begin again, I was divinely led to read Anita's book. I believe it was to remind me that we are all spiritual beings - one with the eternal unconditional love of the Universe. Also, those who harm others are hurt and living in fear themselves; having no understanding of the magnificence of their essence - their true being. If they had that realization they would understand that what we do to others; we do to ourselves because we are all ONE.  This helped me get past the intense pain and guilt to move toward forgiveness and healing - which was hugely important for regaining my peace.<br /><br />One of the other gems of wisdom that resonated with me is the importance of living from joy instead of fear - a truth that I believe can benefit all.  This has caused me reevaluate various aspects of my life with \\"new\\" eyes, and to begin to release what no longer serves me and embrace what makes me truly happy.<br /><br />I am so grateful that Anita has had the opportunity to share her messageof love, unity, and wholeness with so many - especially those souls who are in pain as was I. It can be life changing if read with an open mind.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|It's a simple yet profound book which is very concise and to the point. The focus is on quality instead of quantity. A must read for someone on the path of self-development.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|It was a gift for my sister, nothing sounds better than the voices of the original cast. It is a great musical. Must have cd
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It's not often I learn something from a relationship book, but this one really helped me to listen better to the people in my life that I love. It reminded me that love is freely given, which isn't easy to do. And that what I need to feel loved is different. It helped me articulate need and want and find creative ways to express deep feelings to others. In highly recommend. This is a book that will be on my shelf for a while as a reference guide!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|great book love the store line and found it hard to put the book down and love the series cant wait to read the others
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Well worth every penny. I can't put it down. One of my new favorite tower defense games, second only to lair defense. Very nicely done.

B0012GN47C|5.0|I bought the LP version of this album years ago and had intended to get the CD for some time. I finally did. It's one of my favorite Santana albums, featuring Dance Sister Dance and Europa. The only disappointment is that the two percussion beats that should start Dance Sister Dance are not on the track (they are on the LP). I guess that sometimes happens when they make CDs. Great album, anyway.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|great book love the store line and found it hard to put the book down and love the series cant wait to read the others
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Just what I need on a boring day. Perfect game for kindle. More playing less waiting and free. Haha love it.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|You have to read this one. Love books that keep you on the edge of your seat and you can't figure out. This one fooled me. Great read!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|great book love the store line and found it hard to put the book down and love the series could
B005HSL626|5.0|Good game. I have seen two different versions of this game so far. The one on BB is simpler and easier to score than the one for Kindle. I enjoy this one very much as the sound effects and graphics are better, more exciting.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book by an American Hero. May he rest in peace. Family man who loved his country and his fellow vets.
0670026603|5.0|This is the best book I have read in the last 12 months.  It was captivating.  A love story you could believe in.  The characters were so achingly real and beautifully drawn.  I laughed and I cryed.  Never did I have to suspend disbelief.  I was captured from the beginning.  Should be required reading for caretakers and the uninformed which I was until I read this lovely story.  These characters are going to haunt me for some time in a book hangover for which I will not seek a cure.
B008Y73940|5.0|I really enjoyed this. When I loaded it into my Kindle I forgot I had seen it in the theater in the past; but that was okay.<br />I liked the reality of the solo practitioner living by his wits, of the DA ex-wife. The missing witness &#34;Mr. Green&#34; is a reality in that life.<br />The need to reconcile his obligation to his client with the moral obligation to do right by his locked up former client was a major tension and arc of the story.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this and the black and white one too. I can't wait for new puzzels for both of them.
1577314808|5.0|All you have to do with this book is pick it up, turn to a random-numbered page, and read it. It will calm you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because it is an easy way to remember to read your Bible and the plans help you with problems in life.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|An excellent mix of theology, morality, and sexuality and the the challenge of living positively with physical impairments. Excellent acting. A  pwerful story line. One of the best films.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I was really expecting a lot after reading all the reviews. The good part is I really do like the controls to take some getting used to but the pretty intuitive once you get the hang of it.<br /> The one bad thing is I hit a part of the map and just fell through and was stuck in the middle of the sky even when I hit new game I had to quit the game in<br /> order to start over. I do believe a lot of these reviews are fakes you will see a lot of repeats.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|very fun and imaginative adaptation appropriate for younger kids. you will really enjoy it. no gore to offend younger kids
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! really. its got all the 8-bit cuteness with some fun references like \\"children of the candy corn\\", made me giggle. =) I don't buy movies much if ever but this one is totally worth it. I love how Sonic is a poster child for safety too. totally awesome. BUT you may need to watch it a few times to see everything that is in it. theres a lot of details that really make this movie awesome.
B002ZBTXQY|2.0|Bought this CD in store ages ago wanted to add some of the songs to my playlist on windows media player so i went and put the cd in only to find that the songs are miss labeld where ripping is concerned. the one listed as Missing the song i was looking for was actually the Breath No More (live), Missing was actually labeld as Whisper. If I'd done this sooner I'd would have gone back to the barns and noble i bought it from and gotten my money back. sadly it's been maybe a year since i bought it so no hopes of that<br /><br />also all the live music ew if it had been labeld as the songs being Live I would have boughten a different cd with the songs i wanted on it.
B00AW8VUDG|4.0|From the opening Guitar riff of \\"Hallelujah Rock n' Roll\\" you know what to expect from this album and that is what you get, Bluesy,Hard Rockin music that kicks you in the teeth and it does that very well. Following the style of their last album 2010's \\"Hoodoo\\" Krokus brings up the notch a bit and releases a much better album. The songs are more upbeat and the production really shines. The tunes \\"Go Baby Go\\" and \\"Hard Rockin Man\\" have a perfect vintage \\"Hardware\\" era sound to them, \\"Rattle Snake Rumble\\" \\"Yellow Mary\\" and \\"Bailout Blues\\" are all stand out tracks, And of course Marc Storace is in fine form sounding so much like Bon Scott that it's kinda creepy haha. The only complaint I have about this album is that I wish they would have went more for the heavier sounds of \\"One Vice At A Time\\" \\"Headhunter\\" or the more recent album \\"Hellraiser\\" But for what it is \\"Dirty Dynamite\\" is a solid Hard Rock album for 2013 and if you're a fan of Krokus or any bands of the genre you'll enjoy this release.

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|So far game is really great. Good hidden objects. Not too hard or too easy. Like games from g5. Look forward to more new games.
0374531269|2.0|It's not a bad book, but its just too gruesome for me.<br /><br />It's pretty gruesome so Id say its for maybe 13+ but not much younger. It's a good size of a book. (218 pages) Most books (novels) I read are about 200-250 pages. Most books I have to read are way too big for me(350-400 pages), I find them overwhelming. And I make it to the 5-6 chapter and then lose interest and going straight to wikipedia or find the movie on youtube. I rather write 100 true stories of my life than read huckleberry finn or Tom Sawyer anyday.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The animated weather icon is blocked by another Icon and I can't watch the animation part. Over all its an good app.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I would recomend this book  to any one who likes the inner workings of the people who actually<br />run this country.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excellent characters and storyline.  The beginning is a little slow, but then the twists and turns begun and you won't want to put the book down.  A great read!
B008476HBM|4.0|Not an easy book to read, but basically a good love story.  Unfortunate the status of women in that day and age.
0670026603|5.0|Characters are stunningly developed and the story is ujnique and intimate.  It's also very funny at times.  I practically read it in one sitting.  Outstanding writing and memorable, complex  and compassionate story
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved the era.  I loved the fashions.  I loved the dignity of the language and mannerisms of all the characters, a time we'll never see again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app is ok, not amazing but fun to have as a backup when your bored. Just annoying having to wait for energy to train.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a good book overall, it keeps you hooked each chapter. very good book overall. If you haven't read it yet, do it
0783229526|5.0|Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro portray their characters wonderfully in this film. The way the movie is pieced together is a trip from beginning to end
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Bright graphics, growing difficulty, pleasant sounds of running and dripping water instead of weird repetitive music. Easy to use when children have to wait for something.
B002AF4Y9G|5.0|Very tarantino-esque given the fact that it features a script originally written by Quentin Tarantino. The vivid radical Imagery and lighting creates a very unique setting for this very unique movie. Features a great cast with Robert Downey, Jr. Rodney Dangerfield, and Woody Harrelson and is a great portrayal of how the media presents things to us  Arrived promptly and in good condition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A friend recently got me hooked on The Walking Dead so I had to get caught up on all the reasons I'd missed and the majority of season 3. It just keeps getting better!
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Love this show! Wonderful acting and great writing! Have enjoyed all 7 seasons....wonderful ensemble of quirky characters....and charming  town of Stars Hollow...which I can appreciate being from Connecticut and having gone to boarding school in Washington Ct. , the town that inspired it all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just as good as the first one and yet still left me hanging and wanting more for the third book. I loved this whole series!
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I need to explain something about me, I don't like overly long descriptive passages or flights of fancy.  I believe in most cases they are self indulgent crap and if a reader allows an author to get away with it well, then that's our fault for buying their output. If I want poetry, I will buy poetry.  I also don't like clumsily constructed stories.  And I don't like being spoon fed a story as if I,the reader, were incapable of an intelligent thought, it is insulting.  This book/writer is very guilty of the last sin and is somewhat culpable concerning number two.<br /><br />I listened to this as an audio book and hated it.  I purchased it because of all the great reviews.  They must've read a different book.  It's easier to get through a \\"bad read\\" when listening, thanks to the reader, you don't have to work as hard to get to the end, which I will always try to do. This book was painfully hard to finish, in spite of the reader.  Finishing it was a penance.  I kept hoping for it to turn the elusive corner that would redeem it, but it never did.  I disliked it so much I left a low star review on the Audible site (where I purchased it) but still felt compelled to share my misery here and save some poor souls from the agony that is this book.<br /><br />This book was disturbing and unsettling but I don't think in the way the author intended. It was way too l - o - n - g.  I'm not particularly dense, I pick up on subtleties (if an author is capable of conveying such things, this one, as yet, is not) so I don't need things drubbed into me repeatedly before I get it.  Yes, the main character has OCD and is recovering from a 4 years in the past affair turned abusive in the extreme.  The story itself would've been okay, maybe a little above average if it had better editing, think cutting.  I didn't have any empathy or interest in the main character or her so-called friends and associates, I kept hoping the earth in England would swallow them whole just to put them and me outof our mutual misery. The whole lot of them were unsympathetic, poorly characterized, uninteresting people.  I tried to care but just couldn't.  They were like puppets or pegs on a board.  I don't care what anyone says, that's bad writing.  It was an agonizing read/listen.  This author may have a future but not if all of her 486+ relatives keep leaving fake reviews to make her feel special.  You can learn more from your mistakes than your successes and it's not looking good for Ms Haynes with all these \\"great\\" reviews.
1936608898|4.0|This important read for anybody wanting to understand how food effects your body and finding better ways to eat and cook.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Not as good as the Killing floor, but I made it through it. I hope his newer works are not exactly the same with a few revisions to the outline.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Another excellent Jack Reacher story. It was interesting to go back in time to where his journeys started. A recommended read.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was a fan of the X Files and this series really fills the need.  I just hope that they stay around for a while.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|Just more of the same from Tim Burton.  Nothing new or different about the story line.  Nothing original about any of it.  It wasn't really funny, it wasn't really scary and it wasn't really dramatic.  It wasn't really . . . anything.
0062082353|5.0|Great read!  One of America's heroes that nobody knows, sad the media would not cover his memorial.  Buy a copy you will be trilled to have a copy of this book.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great cast and a good recount of what really happened.  Suspsensful to the end.  Ben Affleck does a good job.
B0035HKWM6|5.0|When I watched this movie it made me laugh so hard I couldn't help myself and I LOVED it! :)
B004HWKWL4|5.0|wonderful, inspirational. Read this when my father passed on. Have given as a gift when others lose a family member. Comforting
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is so sweet and fun that's for putting it out but I can't play it because it is weath money
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game I am hooked on it! I was so excited that it was available for Kindle. I play it all the time on my computer. Great to be able to play on the go.
B00633W614|1.0|Read the first in this series and enjoyed it.  This was just as good. Reading each in the series.  Can't wait to get to all the rest. They have everything, history, romance, deceit, and travel.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|awesome movie, watched it here then had to buy it here to watch as much as i want! BEST EVER
0062014536|5.0|This series is nothing short of a tour de force, and Lauren Oliver is the Stephen King of her generation--capable of writing for different age groups, on different topics, in different styles, but at a level of exceptionally high quality despite how prolific her output is. Some have complained the ending wasn't what they'd hoped for, but REQUIEM is consistent with the whole trilogy and LO's work generally. That is, great literature!
B003FHMHPQ|3.0|I liked Earth Angeles, and Realms of the Earth Angels is just as good because it's the same text with just a little bit omitted and a little bit of new text added.  That was my only disappointment, not enough new material.
1611761115|5.0|Daniel Pink has ensconced himself in the Pantheon of popular, accessible business writers.  The 80s had Tom Peters; the 90s, Stephen Covey and Jim Collins; the early 2000s, Malcom Gladwell.  Now is Daniel Pink's time to join that elite fraternity.  He is influencing the way leaders lead, and the way people see themselves as contributors to the world of &#34;work.&#34;
0307361012|4.0|I started the Harry Hole series with Nemesis then Devil's Star. There are multiple references to this story in those books and it's great finally get some of the back story.<br />Harry is sent Australia to assist in investigation of the killing of a young Norwegian woman.<br />I really like the international flavor of the series and in this book we meet a bunch of Austalian cops, a few Aboriginal characters and a Swedish love interest in the typical list of situations- the drug underworld, the seedy part of town, towns on the outback, city parks and the aquarium.<br />I highly reccommend &#34;The Bat&#34;. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that they might all be 5 stars and I'm saving the 5th star cause I think there might be even better in the series - Go Nesbo!
B004XQYBA2|4.0|I was really surprised by how many features this app has, it makes doing Sudoku puzzles even more fun! Get it!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Much like Tolkien, it's easy for a reader to completely immerse in this world.  Each chapter leaves you wanting more.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Never leave a reveiw but this app is awesome.  It breaks it down so you know how much battery life you have left depending on what your doing.  Finally an app. worth bragging about.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Nicely done game. Kept me engaged and interested. Puzzles were challenging but definitely not frustrating.  Only con is when you think you are buying the game for a price then find out later you have to purchase the rest of the game with more money.
0425252868|5.0|After hearing the reviews of the book, I knew i had to get it, I am a professional scale model builder, I used the book for reference and events that happen to the aircraft and men, to build a scale replica of both aircraft. what these to men did was amazing. Again outstanding book.<br />  Kelly Cottle/ MMStudios
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I started reading these book and could not stop. I love this book series. I can't wait for more to come

B00BHMETKC|5.0|You know a movie is good when it gives KFC a cameo. Well played, Argo. Well played. The Colonel would be proud.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love that I can access this from anywhere now. I haven't gotten the hang of using it on the kindle yet. But soon enough.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|A wonderful read.  This well told tale is both touching and insightful.  It opens up a piece of history that the world has moved beyond but is well worth learning about
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Normally I run into problems with loading, so far nothing like that happens on the kindle. Great job. . .
B0073ODRKG|5.0|This collection doesn't include tracks like &#34;Justify My Love&#34; or &#34;I'll remember&#34; but don't forget those were movies' soundtracks or were included in compilation records as extra tracks, these are only STUDIO albums

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I just hooked Amazon.com up to my Wii so I can have that movie experience.  This will definitely get more use now!!
0761169431|1.0|Thank God I checked this out from the library and didn't buy this piece of junk attempt to make origami.  Cool idea, but it is way to hard, even for someone who has beginner origami experience, in fact I was able to do an advanced origami in a different origami animal book.  It is way to hard to do anything in this book except for 1 easy easy Boba Fett, I was able to do.  The directions STINK, they are TERRIBLE, in fact in appears the author expects you to be able to get from one step to another without even showing you all the steps.  OK lets do A, now jump from A and do Z without explaining how to do B-Y.  Terrible for anyone who is even slightly experienced, man you have to be a Pro or forget it.  Avoid this at all costs unless you are a genius at origami without clear instructions or like trying to put furniture or other projects together with instructions that appear in English, but are really a foreign language.  AGAIN AVOID THIS TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT TEACHING ORIGAMI!!!!!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Matt Smith has become my favorite Dr. Who and this was his best season yet.  He's really comfortable in his role. Not impressed with the streaming quality - Our internet speed was 15+, but it kept downgrading us to low quality.

1400052181|5.0|My granddaughter turned me on to this book which is a medical history that reads like a novel.  You see how modern medicine got it's start.  All the things we take for granted today were someone's brainchild.  However, it also gives insight to those who were &#34;used&#34; for medical knowledge.
1451695195|4.0|This is something we all wonder about.  I recommend it as something you will find interesting and that will possibly increase your faith.
0765325950|5.0|I have read all the books in this series and was excited to get the final book. I feel that the story gave a complete picture with some of the characters and others could be invloved in more stories. I enjoyed reading it and at the same time I was sad to be at the end.

B008YKGQR4|3.0|It's OK. I haven't found a fb app for my kindle that I love. This has been the best so far, even better than one I paid for.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I enjoyed the rich language and slow starting pace. The characters are rich and detailed and I look forward to seeing where the series goes.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|What a great mix of concepts.  Space Military, time relativity, great action and story line.  This one had it all and gets my recommendation without hesitation.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Didn't see the twist of this one coming. This was a wonderful book written by Colleen. I couldnt put this one down
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you are a child of the 80's you'll really like it, if you were an arcade rat like me you'll love it.  So well researched, great concept, incredibly well written.  The only book I've read recently that made me pick up the phone and call my friends telling them they had to read it Now.  I only hope Mr Cline can follow it up because I didn't want it to stop.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I've played this game on my husband's iPhone and its awesome, oh my android however it doesnt respond to touching the screen 3/4 of the time...I hope that gets fixed!!!!
1423113462|3.0|This is more of a 3.5 star rating.<br /><br />My feelings towards The Lost Hero are mixed, maybe because my expectations were so high for the continuation of Percy Jackson - a series that I love and hold close to my heart. Gone is Percy's sarcastic first person narration, gone is the focus on our favorite characters, and even Percy himself is gone. It was a bit jarring to get used to at first, but in the end, I liked it.<br /><br />It's just not what I had in mind for a Percy Jackson book.<br /><br />The good: there's still the wonderful myths that are tied up in modern day settings, and we're introduced to some new characters, including Jason Grace, who I didn't find anywhere near as fun as Percy. I found Leo to be my favorite of the new characters - his sarcasm worked for me and I'm always a fan of the underdog.<br /><br />All in all it was good, just a jarring change for me. I've picked up the Son of Neptune, where Percy comes back (yay!). So we'll see what happens.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|This book contained alot of historical facts which made it very interesting, but, it was also predictable and boring at times.  I would recommend it to anyone who has alot of time to read--the book is long--but I would not say this is a &#34;must read.&#34;
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty fun. I like it. similar to lots of horse computer games. can not be played all at once. try it out!
B00005N6KG|3.0|I wanted something for sports run. This was way too short for me and most of the time I had to run without it. I was not happy with it. I wanted to return it, but it seems amazon admitted it's fault and said that since I am it's premium customer I can keep it and they will refund the money. Well All well that ends well.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is the same great show that brought you through Seasons 1 and 2. However, the plot is no longer quite the same, as the characters are established, and we are not taken deeper, into stranger and unexpected plots.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great Show! Enjoyed every minute of it so far. I especially like that there are no commercials to suffer through!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This is one of those games that anyone can play no matter how experienced or inexperienced you are playing videogames.<br /><br />I didn't buy it when they just released it because I thought paying 15 dollars for it was too much. Got it for 7 a week ago and now that I think about it, I believe I missed out on a lot of fun thanks to being cheap.<br /><br />Three words that come to my mind when trying to define this game: immersive, epic, engaging.<br /><br />As of right now my wife -who's not a gamer by any means- is going through the game and having a blast playing it. She has liked other similar games in the past, like Syberia I, and Syberia II...<br /><br />Cannot recommend this game enough. Will keep you engaged for hours and hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|That game is awesome! It is my number one awesome game! It make me<br />feel awesome because it have mission and also I love mission  and perfect<br />that game have  mission so I love that game!!!!!!!******  also thank to someone that who make<br />this game!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This was another great Harry Bosch novel. It started out slow but kept getting better and better until I found it impossible to put down. And then it was over and I must wait for the next book. Keep em coming, Michael!

0596805888|4.0|This book is really, really cool.<br /><br />I'm not usually in the habit of reading cookbooks cover to cover, but this one demanded it. It's not nearly as dense with complicated recipes as most, for one thing, but it's also brimming with interviews and fascinating asides on the science of cooking. Processes that most amateur cooks take for granted are dissected in detail, which arms the reader not only with a wealth of interesting trivia but also useful information for culinary experimentation.<br /><br />In other words, this was another one of those books that I kept reading aloud to my wife while she patiently smiled and nodded.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are actually pretty simple, and in some cases are incomplete or only for an ingredient rather than an actual dish. Rather than serve as a resource for specific cuisine, this book uses recipes as object lessons to illustrate a particular process (e.g. a ceviche recipe to punctuate a section on the use of acids and bases in food preparation). The result is a general reference book on cooking for the scientifically inclined, though it's also a handy go-to guide for a variety of recipes both simple (hot chocolate) and advanced-yet-still-pretty-simple (duck confit).<br /><br />That latter feature is an important one. The main audience for this book is people who can build a robot and yet are frightened by a food processor. Potter takes great care to explain the science of food in such a way that it makes sense to a coder or engineer, and expands that notion into explaining how the skills that those professions demand--efficiency, versatility, and a certain DIY ethic--are extremely useful in the kitchen. This is evident in both the conversational, sequential style of the recipes and in the large servings of gadget porn and try-this-at-home trickery.<br /><br />I would have read this book even if it didn't contain a single recipe; I was hooked by the time I got to the trivial bits on the body's process for responding to capsaicin, and the chart of ideal temperatures for when the tasty and not-so-tasty proteins denature. The recipes are a welcome bonus, and ensure that this book is good for all kinds of different readers: science nerds, beginning cooks, and those just looking for a few more recipes for their repertoire.
B00A655N8I|5.0|Loved it from beginning to end! Mr. Gergiev's conducting its always full of surprises. All singers we're great! I can't wait for Das Rheingold, Siegfried and Götterdämmerung. Hopefully M Jonas Kauffman will sing Siegfried.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Throughout playing this game, all I could say was that it was perfect.<br />That's biased and debatable, yes, but that doesn't change the fact that it has way more content than the original game and it has a section for bonus contents such as the cutscenes, original art, music, live performances, and more.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The writer gave a very honest and educated introduction to s & m for those of us more like the leading lady, when is the movie coming out!?
B0034DGPEU|4.0|An Irish girl living among slaves is the beginning of this novel.  It moves through her life and gives a good picture of the way of life of both the aristocrats and slaves.  Although sometimes predictable, there were enough twists to make it move along at a good pace. It was interesting to look at the background information that the author used to create her story and characters.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys  reading about the precivil war era in the United States.
B000MYFILK|5.0|I wish they still made movies like this today.  Of course Audrey Hepburn is such a special actress that she made this movie possibly more than the producers ever expected.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|When a remake of a movie is done, it's hard for those of us who remember the original to compare. But if the younger generation has not seen the original version, it's a good second.
0142407542|5.0|There are many things to love about this story.  The characters are all the same from the original story and the mouse is as clever as ever.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It's was a fun and easy read. I enjoyed it and was sorry to see it end!<br />Thanks John G, looking forward to another<br />Dorothea Seidenstein
0812993292|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  However, it is not for the reader of thrilling mysteries or action apcked adventure.  It is a compelling story of love renewed after years pain and sadness. His journey is amazing and the people he meets very interesting.  A life story of travels and life events that we can probably all relalte to.  Marilyn Sedgwick
B009O2XY12|5.0|I really enjoy this game because it provides quite a challenge and is addicting.  I just wish it would refill quicker.
B007REV4YI|5.0|With Daniel Craig, that is.  While all the other Bond movies were great, Daniel's Craig's Bond is edgier and sexier. The almost non-stop action was thrilling, and there were several moments in this film where I physically jumped in my seat.  Casting was brilliant, also.  Loved it, and will watch it many more times, just like all of the other Bond movies in my collection.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is super fun and I love it a lot. I play it all the time and really enjoy it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I loved this game!! It was like owning a real horse. Sometimes the it would slow and buffer, but I think that my tablet acting up on me. No, this is the perfect game for horse lovers anywhere. I defiantly recommend getting it :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a couldn't put down kind of a book...brought tears to my eyes at one point. This was the first Cooleen Hoover book that I have read. Read all of her books since. Awesome read!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book took great twists and turns! I couldn't put the book down, I had to find out what was going to happen in each next chapter! I'll forever love the Katniss and Peeta! Entertaining until the very end.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|the game turned FREE so I bought it and wow did he frick me out. BUT the only thing that was bad about it was when I beat it,slenderman just gave up, how do you ask, he stiled following me. but besides that its epic. name Tracy age 9
B008XG1X18|5.0|Slow about finding cool things. So glad to find this. Addicting. Found great ideas for food, hair and makeup tricks. Wow cool shoes and clothes too.

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|My 9 year old loves this game. She likes that you can compete against other real people. This game gets the imagination flowing.
0525457585|5.0|First off I must caution that I was appalled by the way the movie cheapened the story. The book is incredibly written, and absolutely beautiful. What most readers who gave the book low scores fail to realize is the innate wisdom the book offers all ages. I have read the book every several years from age 8 and up. I am now in my thirties. Each time, and at each stage of life, the philosophy and sagaciousness of the book are quite striking... at least to those who are willing to listen.  This is not a tawdry fantasy romp, but rather a haunting reflection of inherent human nature and inner struggle. The wisdom offered is not blatantly presented, but rather, quietly hidden, so only the most attentive and intelligent reader may discover them.  One must have an open mind and reread many times to fully grasp the wonder of this work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a fun game, great for all ages. In app purchases are not a vital part of the game, like in most other games.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great even on my Kindle Fire.  Great app.  Loads quickly and has nice interface.  Highly recommend thus app to all
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The whole family loves this movie. Funny and entertaining. My son could watch this movie over and over again, all day long!
067144901X|5.0|We originally found this book at our local library. My little one loved it so much that we had to get our own copy. The drawings are fun and colorful. The language is simple but entertaining. Sandra Boynton really understands her audience!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book. I picked it up as a time filler between a series I was reading and I couldn't put it down! It was one of those books that I stayed up all night reading even though I had to go to work in the morning. I finished it just in time to get showered and ready for work. :)
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Yet another great story.  Once I started it I couldn't put it down.  Glad that the follow on book was written because they do leave ya hanging.
B0055OMBIU|5.0|My Grandchildren are thrilled with this product. The entire family is enjoying working on this together.  My granddaughters will<br />be taking it to their French classes to share.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is quit fun. Some reviews say its not scary but I say it is. Its not bad scary its a very cheap scare but its fun to play at a sleep over to scare your friends. I also like that you can choose between day and night and add fog if you want it. Its a great game.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Well written, heart-breaking story especially as a parent, but enough quirky parts to make you laugh out loud. Makes you think differently about cancer and the people it touches.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I'm amazed I have not read Lee Child before this.  I just can't wait to finish the one I've started to begin the next one!<br /><br />I'm amazed I've not read Lee Child before this.  I can hardly wait to finish the current novel I'm reading to begin the next!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Super easy controls and really fun to play. Helps kill the downtime and gets really addictive, and more challenging the farther you go...
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am never disappointed with any Michael Connelly novels.  You come to know and love the characters he writes about.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A real page turner....I couldn't put it down :)<br />I can't wait to see what happens next in the silos.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Drop your Kindle with this attached and it can bend the micro USB male end, then  the cord will no longer work. I bent the micro end back straight but the connection with the wire must have broken.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Acting okay, story okay, but not enough oomph for an oscar. The suspense isn't extreme enough, action is mild—it's more of a documentary. Actors are great, however.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I wish there was a 3 1/2 star rating because that is what I would give this. After a relatively slow start, I found myself immersed in the story and really wanting a good outcome for the hostages involved. At first I thought that the dull beginning was going to continue and this was going to be another Academy best picture flop. While I don't think it is an excellent film it is gripping and a good film, nonetheless. The BD / sound effects were nothing to write home about but still a good transfer.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This game is very simple and intuitive. I have found that the “very simple” playing level is what I would consider a “medium” level. Other than that I love it and would highly recommend it for anyone that likes to play Sudoku.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a gripping, immersive Bond story. If you are buying Blu-Ray, the transfer is absolutely the best I have seen with crystal-clear images and pristine HD surround-sound. If you have ever liked Bond, you will like this for sure.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was better than I thought it was going to be. I threw the BS flag a few times but hey... it's called BATTLESHIP.
B002KVZBGA|4.0|Michael Caine, is as usual brilliant, and the final sequence makes the whole movie a great deal of fun. Tense and clever.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like the site BUT I don't like the product adds that run across the bottom of the it. I couldn't find anyway to get rid of it. If it wasn't for that I would have given it a 5star.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is a cleaver movie with great acting, and some terrific shots of Paris, especially in the rain. Jumped into the top 10 on my favorite movie list.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This old house has always had night light problems.  Instead of taking the chance of having a plug-in one, we just haven't bothered.  They melt, you have to turn them off manually (what's the sense of a \\"night\\" light?), and the little bulbs always blow out, to say nothing of the potential fire hazard.  I've had more than one of them that's looked a tad fried.  No thank you.  The Hipe 8 LED automatic night light has provided just the solution I was looking for.  When I think motion or movement sensor, I usually think of outside lighting, but this is perfect for a dark hallway.<br /><br />There are three settings on this night light, \\"on,\\" \\"auto,\\" and \\"off.\\"  Depending on what your needs are at any given moment, you'll have options.  For example, I need this to traverse a darkened hallway in my house.  I turned it on just before dark to the automatic setting, which will detect any motion in the hall.  When I went to bed (I'm the last one up over the stairs), I picked it up and turned it off.  Mind you, this can be screwed into the wall or attached via a 3M double-sided Velcro, both of which are included in the box.  The only thing not included are four AA batteries.<br /><br />I have a roaming cat, so obviously I'm not going to want this night light going on an off all night so therefore I'm shutting it off once I hit my bedroom.  There are many uses for this light and obviously my situation is a unique one, but I can see this being used for everything from lighting up a closet to detecting that mischievous toddler who decides that getting up in the middle of the night is fun (been there, done that).  The LED lighting is very bright and actually lights the hallway, enough for me to be able traverse it safely.  This Hipe night light has definitely solved an age-old problem of a darkened hallway in this old house.<br /><br />SPECS:<br /><br />~ Power source:  (4) 1.5-Volt, AA batteries<br />~ Working current  120 mA<br />~ Static current 30~40uA<br />~ Time delay  10 plus/minus 2-sec<br />~ LED quantity 8 pcs.<br />~ Single power  0.6-watts<br />~ Rated load  0.48-watts Max.<br />~ Detection range  5m Max.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book on what it takes to become a SEAL, what it's like to be a SEAL, and it gives a fascinating  insight into the mind and life of Chris Kyle.  He is very transparent about his professional life and the toll it takes on your family life. This man was a patriot's patriot.  It's a shame he is no longer with us.
B002QCAXOS|5.0|This is the original and it is so much better than the remake.  This HD version on my large screen was excellent.  The story line, the acting, everything about this version makes it worthwhile buying this DVD.  I first saw this on PBS years ago, managed to get a tape of it which was okay but in black and white and grainy. and the sound was tinny.  But this version brings back the beauty of the full color version, this sound is excellent, the cinematography lovely.  the cast over all is strong and brings an aspect authenticity to the film.  I recommend this DVD highly.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|I love a good quirky movie, but this one seemed like it was just trying too hard to be different. I never felt connected to any of the characters. Too bad - it has a great cast.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|A flawlessly written and executed film, with the most extraordinary performances from a cast of actors that have you believing every word, every gesture, every nuance.  This is the one you've been waiting for; the perfect movie, the one that draws you in from the first moment, and keeps you there until the very end.  You will want this film in your library as this is one to watch over and over again.  It's joyous!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The acting is well done and the drama is compelling. I even liked Ben Afleck and I usually try to avoid his movies. He made a good movie this time!
B000HC2PCM|5.0|Pure voice and plenty of variety on this CD from a classic country performer. A must have for every classic country lover.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was not what I expected. Not sure what I thought it would be.but I say it was how I believe that.s wondering how many kids are living this way not bringing able to trust people or even themselves and overcoming many issues. But very Gleason the ending
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really like this book! It's very addictive and the other makes you feel like you're right there watching this happen, instead of just reading it. It's not a feel good book so that's why I'm only giving it four stars, it's very good though because it is truly written from the heart.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This cable is awesome. Charges my tablet much faster than the stock USB cable. Great product. Definitely recommended for your tablet.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I've been watching Downton Abbey every Sunday afternoon and I'm really enjoying it, especially the episodes about the war. Very interesting- I had no idea what a foxhole was like. Yuck.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|There's so much material here that you might want to think of this one as \\"L.A. Woman and her Kid Sister\\"<br /><br />The 40th Anniversary Edition of \\"L.A. Woman\\" contains a remastered version of the complete original album on CD 1 and alternate versions of most of the album along with studio chatter and outtakes on CD 2. This is an intelligent way of approaching bonus tracks because they don't ruin the flow of the original running order, and most of the bonus tracks are especially fun to listen to if you're a die-hard Doors fan. If you're not a die-hard, you're better off just getting one of the many 'Greatest Hits' packages so you can have copies of the three best-known songs here, including the title song, \\"Love Her Madly,\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm.\\"<br /><br />If you've never heard the album before, it's here that the Doors indulge in what they really did best - play dark blues-influenced rock. The Doors always included blues chestnuts in their live show, and of course \\"Back Door Man\\" was one of the highlights on their first album. But they never devoted a whole album's worth to this style before \\"L.A. Woman\\" and that's a real shame. In some ways it reminds me of the Mick Taylor- era Stones, even though the Doors were no Rolling Stones copycats. Weirdly enough, coming from an era when the blues gave license to many bands to go completely hog wild wih extended meandering jams, in this case the blues focus actually helped to reign in the Doors' excesses. For example, on this album Ray Manzarek almost totally avoids shrill Vox tones and substitutes a rich, gorgeous variety of keyboards. (His electric piano playing on \\"Riders on the Storm\\" is his finest hour, without question). And the reliance on a strict blues structure takes Jim Morrison away from psychedelia and into more straightforward, heartfelt poetic imagery. To me, there's no stronger Jim Morrison lyric or performance than what he gives us on \\"Hyacinth House.\\" Morrison knew how to scare us and disturb us, but on this album he shows that he also knew how to break our hearts.<br /><br />The bonus tracks on the second disc come across mainly as rough rehearsals. If you're into a garage rock sound, you'll probably like these tracks a lot. To me, the second disc proves that despite Jim Morrison's erratic stage antics the Doors were studio perfectionists who could clearly distinguish the best work and chose it for inclusion on the official album. They're fun to listen to if only to get a glimpse into how the Doors could mould basic material into something worth remembering and celebrating 40 years later.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I enjoyed the book, somewhat.  Would not say it is the great American novel but ok for a beach read.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I give the DBFS150 four stars only because of the outstanding service I received from SAM at DB-Tech.  Otherwise I give the unit 3 stars because it created a blue tint on the slides that I scanned.  When I notified DB-Tech of my problem, Sam offered to send a replacement almost immediately.<br />Otherwise, the functionality of this unit is noteworthy.  Most slide scanners required that even mounted slides (those already in a standard plastic or cardboard mount) be put in a time consuming,  awkward- to- use,  frame before scanning.  To use the DBFS 150, a mounted slide is put directly into a slot and is scanned by a push of a button.  With the attached screen it acts as a slide viewer as well (no PC required to view).  It doesn’t get any easier than that!<br />Additionally, the unit can scan film strips and can color reverse negatives for viewing and storage.  The unit will not display the image directly on a PC or TV – which would be a terrific addition for the next generation model.  Scanned Images are stored on the internal memory or to an SD card and then transferred via the USB cable or from the SD card.<br />I would highly recommend this unit provided that the buyer checks the unit out immediately upon receipt in order to avoid some of the manufacturing defects that might show up.<br />I commend DB-Tech for their excellent customer support.
B000SZK41M|5.0|I'm not a fair judge, so the validity of my review is skewed.  I just love Bruce Willis and I love the Die Hard series.  Some are better than others, of course and the first is ALWAYS the best.  I'm just not going to miss an opportunity to hear John McClane say, Yippee Ki Yay M$#@ F&&^%!!!!  Every time I watch Bruce WIllis all I can wonder is, how could Demi trade a man for a boy???
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|If you are a fan of the books you will also really enjoy seeing the characters come to life on the screen. The roles were well casted and the writing has been well adapted. Check it out!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Every time I think a sitcom is hysterical (and it's been a long time since I've thought that about one) I end up comparing the characters to the ones in Whinnie the Pooh.  Every person is in the 100 Acre Forrest.  The Big Bang has every person personified in two apartments and it's hysterical !!  Just when I identify or know someone who identifies with Sheldon, they do something so Penny-like.  Ultimately, there's a little Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, Howard, and Penny in all of us and occasionally we need (or not) our mothers' voices to play in our heads.<br />Six seasons later and I they are still as sharp and quick as ever.  I'm just glad they're all sticking together and that the writers have not made big changes to the characters situations.
B008YI91HS|5.0|This movie is a classic and watching it you actually feel like you are seeing real dinosuars. The story was great and for the time the special effects were amazing.

B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Entertaining and fastpaced.Liked the expanded role of Judy Dench, but the emphasis on age was redundant and heavy-handed. Absolutely no chemistry between Bond and Miss Moneypenny.  As were most movies this year, it was too long.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Do you remember what it felt like the first time you fell in love? How you wanted nothing more than to spend every waking minute with that person, talking about nothing, experiencing everything, and you counted down the minutes, or the days, until you saw them again? Do you remember how you over-analyzed everything the person said, trying to figure out if there was some hidden meaning, some sign the relationship would or wouldn't go the way you wanted? That all-consuming craziness of first true love, thrown into the emotional maelstrom of high school, is the basis for Rainbow Rowell's fantastically quirky and sweet new novel, Eleanor & Park.<br /><br />It's 1986. Park Sheridan is a half-Korean high school student trying his best just to blend in. He has good friends, yet spends much of his time practicing tae kwon do with his father and younger brother, obsessing over his Watchmen comic books, and listening to music by The Smiths and Joy Division. The first time Eleanor walks onto the school bus (I kept being reminded of Molly Ringwald's quote from 16 Candles, \\"I loathe the bus\\"), Park is blown away by her height, her bright red hair, and her unique dress code. Although Eleanor shares Park's seat on the bus, they don't speak at first, for fear of causing ripples in the social strata around them. But little by little, things begin, as Park starts sharing his comic books and making Eleanor mix tapes, and they finally start speaking to one another, and suddenly they realize how much they look forward to these moments.<br /><br />But of course, the course of love--and life--never runs smoothly. While Park's life is a fairly open book, despite his somewhat challenging relationship with his father, Eleanor's life is much more complicated. Moving back in with her mother, her new husband (who threw Eleanor out a year ago), and four siblings, she lives in constant fear of causing her stepfather to notice her. And her mere presence, especially as she and Park grow closer, hasseemed to incense many of her fellow students, who ridicule and bully her for just being her. This constant guardedness affects both her and Park, as she is constantly questioning the things he says and does, and he is worried every time he says something that she'll take it the wrong way. And she doesn't want Park to fight her battles, yet he is constantly compelled to. But despite all of the challenges and roadblocks, they just can't get enough of each other.<br /><br />When the situation at home becomes too much to bear for Eleanor, she makes a difficult decision, and Park, despite what it means, helps her. The ending is a tiny bit improbable, but it doesn't matter, because it shows how each views their relationship, and the other's place in their world.<br /><br />I found Eleanor & Park to be right on target in so many ways. I felt that Rowell's dialogue was humorously authentic without being precious or precocious, and she perfectly captured all of the anxieties--social and emotional--of high school and first love. Above all, I loved these characters so much, that I was rooting for them and found myself completely captivated by their story. I raced through this book and, of course, I'm now sad it's done. Definitely recommended for those who love quirky relationship stories, and although this is classified as a YA novel, it's definitely geared for all readers. I hope you like it as much as I did.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this for my 4 year old nephew by his request because he has it on his kindle at home.  Well I couldn't wait for him to leave because I couldn't wait to play.  That was a week ago...I haven't stopped playing since!
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|most of us already know the story, so the characters, costumes, and acting must carry the drama...no surprises in the plot for anyone who is vaguely culturally aware of Anna's tale of woe.  In this version, the director has decided to treat it as a stage play, which immediately erases any possibility of scope and landscape (think Dr.Zhivago) and forces all drama to be squeezed from the characters.  Knightley isn't up to the task, Jude Law is kept to a minimalist prop...don't waste your time or money.
B005LAII12|5.0|When I saw a clip. I thought it would be cute.  I watched it, and realized that Seth Macfarlane who did the awards show that night he kind of produced it.  But watch out, it's not a movie for young children. My hairdresser I had seen her shortly afterwards. She said she had a niece over and she didn't want to watch a stupid cartoon.  So figured this would be okay. But as soon as Ted started talking, they took it out. So it is okay for older children but definitely not real young children.<br />I still liked it very much.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Well the only thing that this and the book had in common was the title. I can't rate it one start because I didn't absolutely hate it... I mean regardless it is Abe slaying vampires...
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Well done. Casting was perfect . Anthony Hopkins captured the essence of Hitchcock perfectly. The entire cast was spot on!

B00633W614|5.0|Excellent writing, smooth story lines, my only complaint ( and it really isn't) is that the ending leaves you at a point where you can't wait for the next book! Plenty of drama, strong lead characters,and romance ( but not the sloppy kind)

B00571F26Y|5.0|Very insightful. I have been following the contents of this book for sometime now. I have almost completely given up all grain products as food. And I am healthier for it. This book also sheds light on how we came to be in the state of bad nutrition that we as a country are in. Please give it an open minded read. Enjoy.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Up was amazing movie. It had everything love, adventure, and action. Up was very funny and entertaining. I definitely recommend this movie to rent or own. I absolutely loved it.

B008CX2A2I|1.0|Purchased this and was excited about doing things wirelessly from the IPAD and the IPHONE.  Only to find out that this is not compatible with my Onkyo TX8050.  The stereo does not recognize it.  Company should be more clear on what this works with. Waste of time and money.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice app for the Kindle Fire. Has good current condition layout. Extended forecast is good also. Great radar map. 5 stars.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the best headset I have ever bought. The sound quality is literally so amazing that I will actually forget I'm wearing the headset and feel as though I'm in whatever I'm listening to. Now, a few things I wanna talk about. I've seen reviews saying that these things break easily, turn off without telling you, and even the small plastic on the inside breaking off after regular use.<br /><br />Breaking easily: The headset does feel like it could break easily, and by easily, I mean a single fall. So just make sure that you're not being careless with it.<br /><br />Turning off without telling you: Yes, it does do this. I however took notice of why it did this and tested it. The headset constantly takes notice of sound coming out of it. It will cause a small break in sound. If you notice these, then nothing is wrong. It's checking to see if you're listening to anything, and if you aren't, it will shut off to save power. The break in sound is barely noticeable, at least for me.<br /><br />Now I saw a review stating that a small plastic section would break off after regular use. Don't listen to any review that says that. These plastic sections don't do much of anything, and they're completely out of the way. You will only break them if you intentionally do so, OR are reckless with it. I have no real complaints about the headset other than the hinges squeaking every now and again.<br /><br />The vocal transformation software is good, and fun. I had a blast messing with people on skype with it.<br />The surround sound is, again, amazing. I'm hearing parts of songs I never knew existed. I especially like that the headset is isolating. I live in in a noisy house, so the fact these can manage to shut that all out without it even being at full blast, is amazing. I highly suggest this headset to anyone who wants to high quality music, and high quality sound from their games.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Pretty good read. It kept me wanting more. I will be looking for and reading more from this talented author.
B008476HBM|5.0|Such a delight to be absorbed in the cadences of Victorian England.  No one does it better than Jane Austen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have to honestly say that this is the best game ever! I highly recommend this game for your intertainment
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read this book initially 5 years ago and it changed so much for me.  It truly helped me to understand the friction I was experiencing in my relationship at that time.  Since then, I have reread it 2 more times to refresh.  Worth every moment you spend reading it.
B000I14UTS|5.0|I have watched this movie at least a dozen times. I love the way the stage shows mirror the story lines and poke fun at everyone involved. How I wish there were cabarets this good nowadays! The costumes and the choreography have become classics. (And Bob Fosse was an absolute genius in creating the shows.)<br /><br />When the movie first came out, it was considered borderline obscene by many and the casual attitudes about sex were scandalous. How times have changed.
B006BXTOFC|3.0|I like this album. This is a funky music. I am listening this album while I am reading a book.
B00499NHLC|5.0|What more can I say?  The dialogue is great, and the characters are interesting.  If you enjoy the quirky personality of Sherlock Holmes, try it.  The American version is ok, but it is filled with those trite and predictable conversations that plague American film and television.
B003GYEGNO|2.0|Although the character development was good, none of them were very likable.  How does a book written in the 80's qualify as a classic?
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Some of Neil Young's albums have been viewed as &#34;for the die-hards only&#34;.  When I read the description of this album I was figuring fairly high probability that this would be one such album.  But, since I am a die-hard myself, and since this was NY/CH's latest offering, I had to take a chance.  As I started my first run through the CD, my fears were confirmed by the second song.  Oh, man, has Neil lost it?  The songs seemed like a contrived effort to put a NY/CH spin on some old folk songs, and it wasn't exactly coming off well.  Then track 3, Tom Dula, came on, and suddenly the whole thing started working.  The rest of the album was exactly what I had hoped for: brilliant new takes on old tunes, done NY/CS style.  The creations are sometimes a little bizarre, and occasionally peppered with the horrendous background vocals that have sometimes been a trademark of these 4 decade grunge masters, but thoroughly awesome and a must have for any fan of the style.<br /><br />One note: be prepared to rip these tracks yourself in case &#34;auto rip&#34; doesn't work for you.  It doesn't for me.  I have yet to have the tracks for any physical CD I've purchased appear automatically on my cloud drive.
B0052OSTOS|4.0|I have been having problems falling to sleep.  My mind is always racing.  This product allowed me to rest and focus on it.  I fall asleep before the cycle is complete
B00979CS50|5.0|Late 90's offerings from Neil Young and Crazy Horse were very good or even excellent, but never quite the cloud 9 experience that fans looking for the next \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" or \\"Ragged Glory\\" were hoping for.  Well, Psychedelic Pill is it.  85 minutes of NY/CH brilliance.  If you're a grunge fan building your collection, and you've already got Rust Never Sleeps and Ragged Glory, get this next.  If you have their albums from the late 90's, and you're wondering if this one might be lacking in variation or recording quality, stop wondering and just get it.  You won't be disappointed.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Crashed every other time I opened it, sometimes taking my phone with it. Not enough &#34;diamonds&#34; on leveling up, trying to force you to buy from their store. The objects were always in the same 3 or 4 places every time you searched the room. If you like hidden object games, find one that tells a story and has an end (the NevoSoft titles are usually good, and light years better than this). This expects you to work on leveling up endlessly by exploring the same rooms for the same objects in the same places. Plus, it times you out (unless of course, you buy powerups from the store). The map interface was too busy, crawling with monsters & other crap. Do not waste your time.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|A very good read. Hard to put the book down.<br />A few bits of the book are repetitious from other books, but not to the point of being aggravating.<br />I am glad that I purchased it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very subtle book of understanding. A cold, the flu, broken leg or cancer this book acknowledges that our mind and imaginings are just as susceptible as the rest of our body to different degrees of illness.  Perhaps the only thing it doesn't go into more deeply is when the illness is terminal - as opposed to chronic.<br />If you liked the movie and are expecting the same story - you may be disappointed as this Pat is not Bradley Cooper or vise-versa. Much deeper, yet less complicated stakes are at hand in order for this man and woman to greet a happy ending.<br />If you have someone in your life who, in your mind, is mentally unbalanced; or if you suspect yourself of being so, then this read does much in taking the stigma away from the illness and illustrating various paths taken towards the return to a healthy mind, and therefore a happy soul.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|A good premise, well directed. A weak story with whiny victim characters--save Ben's protagonist.<br /><br />Worth the watch on instant play, but not really a keeper.<br /><br />The Canadian's essential role is not absent, but it is secondary.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are great and my 4 year old loves to take care of the horse! It is simple to use
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|From cover to cover this book was a great read. Not quite the ending I initially expected but not an ending that left you wondering either. Very well written!
1932735410|5.0|For anyone that has read the PMBOK, you know what a dry read it is.  However, Mulcahay's book does an excellent job in presenting the content in a way that can be understood.  Case studies, practice exams, questions, and mind mapping exercises are EXCELLENT!  I recommend this to anyone as an exam prep for the PMP test.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story is tense and gripping. The author writes beautifully in detail oriented prose that makes readers relate to the characters. I was surprised at the ending thinking it would be more decisive, but in retrospect it makes sense that the two protaganists deserved eachother. Excellent book.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|The worst possible sequel to the first Silent Hill. This is a gimmicky horror movie. Most of the time the director doesn't even try to create an atmosphere of fear or suspense. His sole objective, it seems, is to make people jump from their seats. If you like the kind of &#34;paranormal&#34; type of movie, Silent Hill Revelation MIGHT be for you. I say 'might' because even in that front the director manages to deeply disappoint at every turn. Save your money...
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|alot of insight to a tragic event. very difficult to image how this young lady survived. If you want to read about courage, strength, this is one for you. All the best to you Jaycee Dugard.
B000FC2PKG|3.0|I enjoyed the book.  It kept my interest but I also questioned whether or not I would see the main character in another book.  It felt a little unfinished towards the end.  It was very suspenseful and the twist and turns will surprise you.  It is worth the read.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|If you haven't heard the Pink Martini's on stage, you have missed a treat.  Listening to this CV takes me back to those experiences.
B0000DIXDR|1.0|What can I say?  Another trauma drama centered around dancing and archaically dated music.  The directors and producers must have been desperate for a movie.  What a dud.
0439023521|5.0|I read The Hunger Games for the first time when it was still new -- back before Mockingjay had been released and before the movie was even so much as a whispering throughout the fandom. I read it because of the enormous number of positive reviews on the book blogs that I frequented, and I read it under the false assumption that the Arena was something like the Colosseum, where gladiators would fight one another to the death. I was also under the false impression that it was Peeta and Katniss alone who had to fight to the death.<br /><br />Anybody who has read the book or seen the movie knows that my assumptions were completely untrue, if not a bit bizarre.<br /><br />In the beginning, I wasn't expecting to love The Hunger Games. I'm not at all a fan of first person perspective and I really detest the present tense because it's so easy to get tenses confused. In fact, Suzanne Collins botches her past tense, past perfect tense and past participle on several occasions in the book, in large part because most writers are accustomed to writing in the past tense when producing fictional pieces. I found this especially frustrating, but bearing in mind that I'm reading young adult fiction, I found it to be forgivable.<br /><br />The second primary problem that I have with this novel is the fact that, having read it three times, I've decided that I don't really like Katniss Everdeen. So allow me to talk about that for a moment. Considering that I've talked about The Hunger Games since I finished reading the novel for the first time, I often feel that I've said it all, but perhaps I haven't.<br /><br />The majority of teen fiction presents us with some variation on the perfect heroine. She's either entirely distasteful, or she's so amazingly perfect that it's impossible not to love her. We either totally pity her or we wish that we could be her. As much as I don't personally like Katniss, she's not that perfect heroine. She's flawed, but not perfectly flawed. While she lacks self confidence, she is aware of her skills as a hunter and of her emotional weaknesses. She is neither perfect nor is she perfectly imperfect. Katniss is the type of character that you should be able to like (and many people do like her), but I just don't.<br /><br />Strangely, I like that about this book. I like the fact that neither Gale nor Peeta are perfect heroes, and I like the fact that there's no rivalry between Peeta and Gale, but each takes his own important role in Katniss' life. The love triangle aspect is to be expected due to its popularity among female teen readers, but it is so incidental in this series that it can be ignored, and the series can be taken for its meaning.<br /><br />Another reviewer referred to this book (and series) not being for intelligent readers. I have to disagree with that standpoint. The book is highly political and shows us the possibility of what can happen when a tyrannical government takes over a country. There are strong references throughout the series to the conditions in communist countries, and it's easy to become engrossed in the dystopian society where the government controls everything and the nation is constantly at war. A thoughtful reading of these novels is bound to open the minds of young people to the possibility that a government can become oppressive -- as many world governments have in the past.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is an educational experience. As an adult reader, I have to say that I would be cautious about giving this book to a younger audience to read, and feel that it is best reserved for mature teen readers who are able to handle the deeper meaning of the scenes that they will read in this novel.<br /><br />That being said, my step children (at the time 13 and 14) loved all three books in the trilogy!elf confidence, she is aware of her skills as a hunter and of her emotional weaknesses.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|If anyone played Slender on the PC will like this game. Pretty much identical in gameplay, but with new environments.<br /><br />You have to find 8 pages pages from a notebook while trying to avoid Slenderman. He'll get you if you look directly at him, so no quick 180 degree turns. He'll very likely be right behind you.<br /><br />Game itself is spooky and fun; controls are nice, but it does lose that scare factor after a while.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved Suzanne Collins' s first book, \\"The Hunger Games.\\" It is a mixture of romance, excitement, and survival. My favorite part must have been the days Katniss spent with Rue. Rue reminded me of Prim, too, just like Katniss said. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a thrilling, adrenaline-pumping story.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I like these kind of games and was excited to play this one. graphics and animations are top notch. dinosaur sounds are nice .it never played music though which I don't mid. the problem is the sheer coin cost to play. to even make food takes most of your earned coins and quest reward cash. in a very short time hit a wall. quests were too expensive to do. to level up dinosaur takes food. tostart making food it costs a lot cash to buy the producer then each recipe costs another wad of coins. in the end you are trapped watching your dinosaurs and waiting to collect cash that way.  ridiculous.  does it sound fun to stare at a screen and wait for a timer in order to collect 100 coins when to make a min amt of food takes 200-500 coins?  blah.  greed ruined this game as they are forcing you to buy their tokens.<br /><br />deleted.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I had mdr-v6 and now got this in my collectibles. Both are very much alike flat headphones. Flat does not mean that you cannot enjoy bass, It has clear bass ranges from lowest of 5Hz in v6 and 10Hz in 7506. They are closed phones so it can make your ear warmer but the clamp force is not alot as per me...comfortable. I can easily wear them for 5-6 hours. To enjoy more, bass equalizer to be used if you are bass head. Being there for 25 year more and standard in sub $150 range, you do not have to look anywhere else in this range.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Put off reading this for a long time. Was told how good it was but didn't I would like it.  It would be a good read for anyone  sometimes it seems that we put such a low value on life.  This<br />Book takes you through such a wide range of emotions hopefully to see the human value.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I've changed my mind.  This device actually works pretty well.  I was appalled by the amount of hair and dirt in the brushes after the first use and assumed that I would need to clean this out after each use.  But it works as is.  The pick/comb is effective at cleaning this out when needed, which for me is about every other month and yes, it's rather disgusting. I only use this sweeper when I see a quick five-minute floor cleaning opportunity.  Otherwise, I use a regular vacuum cleaner for the 45-minute vacuum the entire house project...thus the reason that I only clean the sweeper brushes every other month.  It works better on hardwoods/tile than carpets, but when I recently cleaned up Styrofoam packing debris off my carpet, it did the job.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|The faculty is awesome movie when I order it the DVD came right on the delivery date movie was in perfect condition everything was in order I give everything 5 stars
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|This is not only a great read, but it has meaning also. Absolutely food for spirtual thought. I continue to think of this book, even long after I have completed reading it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app is fun friendly and safe I love going into this app and seeing my beautiful horse .
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I bought this game for three dollars and fifty cents and it wont even let me download it! stupidest game ever. it might be fun if I could even play it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool and the graphics are good and this game has great controls. Great for boring weakends
B008AK8FHM|2.0|all about Eben,  Calling God by an Eastern Diety and anything but the creator of the universes comes up short.

B005K17RU0|5.0|great for keeping up with my weather in my area and to also where my family is. like the simplicity of it as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|As stated in the title, this app is awesome, but it needs all the fun things, like redstone and all the things associated with redstone: carts, tracks, buttons, levers, pistons, ect. This app also needs the Nether. PLEASE NOTE TBE PROPER USE OF GRAMMAR, SPELLING, AND PUNCTUATION THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Very enjoyable game. Great for anyone who like jigsaw puzzles. Lovely graphics.Easy to learn how to play. Plus there is a left handed play option for us southpaws!
B00AEJM6H2|2.0|Not much to it.  Just wasn't interesting to me at all.  Perhaps I didn't spend enough time trying to understand it.  Just really didn't care for it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the amazon forest one...birds chirping and water flowing down the river.....very nice freebie from Amazon, ironic I use the &#34;Amazon&#34; forest for my sound.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|An incredible autobiography by a true American Hero  whose life was cut way too short by senseless violence! RIP Chris Kyle
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show is so much funto watch. I really enjoy the stories & I love the characters. This show will keep you interested throughout the seasons. It is great!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|So mah friends were all leik &quot;dood turn around!!!&quot; so i did and i saw slendy and i was all like oh my jolly knockers its slendy!! and i literally died, its sc&agrave;aaaaaaarrrrrrryyyyyyyy!!!!!!
B009EHDU7U|3.0|Supposedly funny, but I didn't find it so. I was disappointed with it, I guess I expected more humour, judging by the cover! Far- fetched, but great if you are interested in history, and have a good imagination. For a one hundred year old man, he had more energy than most people half his age. Dragged a bit.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Makes it easer to hold my 3DS XL while playing games. Great to have if you have large hands or a controller like feel!
0920668372|5.0|read this book as a child,, and now i can read it to my boys...<br />would definately reccomend to any parent...
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent book I thoroughly enjoy it<br />I am looking forward to seeing the movie.<br />It held my attention all the way through
B008B8AOQI|5.0|This is a very good piece of music! I have listed this among my favorite new finds of 2012! Interesting music with insightful lyrics.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|im so in love with this song, she is def back and going to dominate the charts with this song and new album..... 2013 is Mariah Carey`s year!!!!!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|i never take out of the case! the only problem is that on speaker people cant really heard u.bisedes that i have no problems :)
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Its a good app, but it gets a bit boring when you have to play the same 2 mini games.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book has it all--from the lows of addiction to unfailing faith and love of God family and country.  Spellbinding although you know how it ends--your heart will still break for the Brown family during the last chapters.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|the monsters are so cute. the only problem I have with the app is that it never lets me go visit random ranches (which is a huge goal- in which I dont have the coins/money to spend to pass through the huge goal) and keeps telling me to update, but I have been on the most recent version on my kindle fire.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was extremely well written with a great plot and character development process. This is a must-read for people who like castaways survival stories.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|What can I say. It is Bocelli. Although seems like thrown togeather a little and choice of duet partners leaves a little to be desired but it is still part of the collection. Would not pass it up.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I've played many Slender Man games before, but this is the best I've played. I strongly believe you should get it. Especcially since it's free. Great on Amazon and The Play Store (which you have to pay for on there).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is an interesting. learning experience I hope you enjoy it it is quite fun as a horse lover it is fun
B0063M22QO|3.0|This is an easy game. I would like to see it have a score and levels though. This way I would know if I was improving.
0385347774|5.0|The first few chapters of this book did not evidence how the protagonists would play out their roles; I was completely surprised.  This psychological thriller was a delight to read.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|The DVD was in perfect condition when I received it.  Also one of the single best movies I've ever seen.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|While I really enjoyed the film, based on all the hype, wasn't as good as I expected it to be,
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this game is fun. Cause it is like temple run but has technology. It is different but is a good game it is entertaining for all ages.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just like the two other books, i loved this one. Out of the three i have to say that this i  my least favorite but it is still enjoyable in its own ways. The biggest disappointment to me about this book is how collins decided to end the series. I felt like she could have done a lot more but thats not to say that i didnt love the book. I am so glad that katniss chose who she did in regards to peeta or gale. Who she picked is perfect for her. There is a tremendous amount of death in this book but it adds to the grave nature of the story and is well placed.
B006M9NJFG|1.0|Very low quality and THE CAP LEAKS. Bear Grylls should stop endorsing this particular product.<br />U.S. Military surplus canteen with cup and case is by far much better quality and much cheaper.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|i liked this movie , it was creepy without being overly gory like most horror movies<br /><br />definitely recommend,,really good if you are into creepy movies
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am not a large person. But after having my first baby I gained unwanted weight. I don't like going to the gym so I figured I would give this a try. A friend of mine had lost TONS of weight after just 30 days. Like literally went from being pretty big to a teeny tiny 3! I was amazed and ordered this asap. I, unfortunately, am not in shape. I literally despise working out. After doing this the first night I thought I was going to DIE. I tried so hard to keep up. I even went along with the &#34;beginner&#34; instructor, and absolutely could not stay with her. I had to take so many breaks along the way that Jillian tells you not to do! I am going to admit I only did the video about three or four times before giving up. It was just way too much for me to push myself to do. I don't have the motivation or will power to go through with the full 30 days. Since ordering the DVD I have also gained even more weight...wish I could make myself do it...but it really is a rough workout. If you stay with it though, my friend is proof it will give you amazing results!
B000002H70|5.0|The Cure and Robert Smith in grate shape, Best work. Only experience after successive successes permit to create such an album
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|The movie is very good but the audio and visual quality is not good, especially given a high rental price. Probably, I will use other agencies for movie rental
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Just a sensational disney movie. Can watch it over and over again! Highly recommend for anyone of all ages! Go see it!
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|Could have been better.  If you are obsessed with video games, then it might appeal to you.<br />Best ages: 4-8.  Reminded me too much of Toy Story, so the concept of video game characters coming to life just didn't seem very original or unique.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Very nice graphics. It did take a while to download. Like the mini puzzles and hidden objects. Cant wait to finish this adventure
B002PA8Q1S|3.0|I'm not going to sit here and say that the book was better than the movie because everyone on this website should already know that is always the case. It was an entertaining movie, I probably won't watch it again but entertaining nonetheless.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|The entire Spartacus seasons have it all!<br /><br />Really enjoyed it, so much so, I watched the entire season in two sittings!
B002F3UZL4|3.0|I thought it was going to be more about fighting than a love story. I should have know consider who's in it. You win some and you lose some, what can I say.
B0060AY85C|4.0|Well written, as usual, by Toni Morrison,  But a bit depressing.  Idon't know that I will strongly recommend it to others, althoough some will undoubtedly like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was the best app I have. It is a good copy of the computer with only a few missing details.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finishing the series was bittersweet. Such a powerful story that can mean a magnitude of different things to anyone who reads it. Not the ending I thought it would be,but beautiful nonetheless.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Besides the achievments and more scores links from the high scores page being null it is a Great game. I do hope my achievements are still saving though.
B008OHV5QO|5.0|Neil Young has always been one of my favorite rockers.  He has never been afraid to try NEW things and Journeys is no exception.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie kept me on the edge the entire time.  I really couldn't see how it was going to end.<br />Very fun1
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil young rocks on in this CD.  He has never been afrad of NEW horizons and this is no different.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love it! Downton Abbey is fantastic. Tried to get Seas 2 from another source for several weeks without success. Received from Amazon in about a week
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Excellent book that goes way beyond the story line.  You develop a good sense of what it was like to be a German Fighter Pilot and an American Bomber Pilot.  Not all German military men were Nazis!
B0037471TE|4.0|This is about a man who finds himself without a memory of his past and slowly unravels an amazing international assassin chasing / love / CIA etc story.  it keeps up the pace and I found myself looking forward to getting back to it.  it is the first of the Bourne series.  A good read and adventure, just maybe a little far fetched however.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This is a sophomoric attempt at humor that is filled with obscenities, racial and ethnic slurs, drug use, excessive drinking, driving while intoxicated, and other socially unacceptable behaviors. The humor is crude. Although the &#34;R&#34; rating should have been a clue as to the depravity of this movie, we have all grown to expect something better from Mark Wahlberg. Don't waste your money.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones spoiled me because now I expect every speaker system to be high quality and impeccably clear. The cord is a good length so you don't have to worry about moving around if you've got it plugged into your keyboard.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it . my grandkids really enjoy playing this when they come for a visit. looking forward to another version someday.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|I thought this would be boring but  I was drawn in from the first  scene.  Using rats running around after each evil act was brilliant. Showed what  lengths people will go  to for power and revenge.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I have seen slender games on YouTube but I never played it, then I seen it was the free app of the day, so I'm like why not, and holy crap. It's fun, scary as hell when you put on your head phones early in the morning (still dark ) I even had a few jump scares got to 7/8 notes first game. I really like it, now to scare my little brothers with it.
B008BRC7BE|5.0|Great Songs, Great Voice.  For any Sabbath Fan or Ian Gillian Fan. A must havefor your collection !<br /><br />This is an album not to miss.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like this game.It is pretty easy. I don't understand all the plays, but I am learning. Maybe a tutorial ?
B00007M5CO|5.0|While the music is fresh and energizing, the surprising thing about Bajofondo is that they're an awesome, rockin' live stage band.  When they perform, no one sits, including their bandoneonista, who props a foot on a step stool and proceeds to bounce up and down incessantly all concert-long, even raising the mighty instrument over his head as he plays.  This is a band that raises the roof so powerfully that you fear the ceiling might collapse.  If you have a chance to see them play live, GO!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|. I haven't had any device to use apps. before so I guess it's not ebay's fault. I like my Netbook better using full screen.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Did not know I had a camera option on the kindle. The guide made it seem like I needed an app. It works good, but wouldn't have bought it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is definitely one of the books that i'll never forget. I really recommend this book.<br />For those who watched the movie, this has a better \\"climax\\".
B000OBYLVO|5.0|This is another one of those movies that I try to catch every time it comes on regular TV.  I just watched it last night.  I  have probably seen it over 25 times.  Now I have it on my Kindle to watch whenever I want...
B000PMLFRA|5.0|As someone who has been a fan of Star Wars as long as I can remember, I have also owned them in every format that's existed since my birth. The Quality of Star Wars on Blu-Ray is nothing short of spectacular! If you are a Star Wars fan, you will not be disappointed. It comes with so much freaking extra stuff, you'll be busy for days.<br /><br />I am NOT EVEN going to get into the whole George Lucas messing with them argument or the firs three not being any good. If you don't like that part, I can totally respect that, but this is about the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I received this for my Christmas and it comes bound like a book, with a nice slide over cover. I bought a secondary copy that I never intend on opening.<br /><br />If anything ever happened to either set, I would not hesitate to purchase again. As with everything else, ordering from Amazon is super easy and they showed up via UPS in perfect condition.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love this game! I have completed tasks. I am enjoying the story also. I will pay to continue this game.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|As a long time Gerry Butler fan, I see all (and own most) of his movies. This is one of my favorites now. While I sometime enjoy his \\"blockbusters\\", this is the kind I love. It's about people, it's about heart, it's a movie that was made for love of the story, not for love of the mega bucks. The characters draw you in and you care about them, you cheer for them and cry for them.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|I didn't know what I was getting I guess.  The dialog was incessant and annoying.  The students' dilemma is compelling, but then the horror made me sick.  It was effective, but unpleasant.  I would definitely categorize this as psychological horror - it's been over a year since I see it and I still think back to this movie when I'm remembering the horrors of life and how fascinated and yet sick to my stomach this movie makes me.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|Fascinating, the future is here and this novel explains an affordable way to commit mass murder. I don't really want to say I enjoyed it, but I did.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|All the kids who would just wish slenderman would die are putting bad reviews here today. Thanks Amazon for this FAOTD Im an old girl who knew who slenderman was but had never played the game and it's fun. Its all about the &quot;something evil behind you chasing you&quot; fear that everyone has.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Hard book to put down. Had a great twist to the story. Very well written. Great book to read for a book club.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this movie. I was sincerely happy that I decided to rent it. You're watching a man struggling with his own demons, and although you don't want to route for him because in real life you would be upset if a pilot was intoxicated while you were on a plane, you are. I have seen many people struggling with the pain of addition, and it takes a dramatic life situation for them to get clean. I thought this movie brilliantly showcased how someone could struggle with such addictions and not be a bad person.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|If you were alive in the late 1970s and early 1980s, this film will be an interesting walk down memory lane. Great story, great acting and great action - it has it all.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Casino Royale introduces Daniel Craig as the new James  Bond  aka 007.<br /> I have enjoyed many of the Bond actors and films; I've seen them all.<br />Daniel Craig's portrayal brought back a gritty, human, and more realistic feel to Bond. More Sean Connery than suave Roger Moore. We all enjoy the Bond films for action, cool gadgets from Q, the peppery relationship with M, all these elements are here and more. Craig brings new dimension to the character and the film's plot is well written and well acted by all the cast. You'll enjoy the ride!
B001GXNBJW|5.0|There are few musicians today that can make music like these guys. Rubber Factory has it all; When the Lights Go Out, Tie Me Down, some of the best mix of blues/rock music there is - they were born way too late.
B0091R30MS|5.0|Everything I was taught in school was wrong. If you think Columbus discovered America, you need to read 1421. Columbus and Magellan were given the credit for great discoveries, but the truth is they had Chinese maps showing them where to sail. Gavin Menzies has done exhaustive research into this subject, and tells the story with an abundance of evidence. This book should be required reading for all world history courses.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|If you're into James Bond, you've already seen this. If you're not, it's worth watching. There is no continuing plot or ongoing drama other than the &#34;Bond action&#34; and that's reason enough to see this film.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Cute movie for whole family! Loved some of the references to older video games that I played in the 80's. Would watch again.
B0084670FU|4.0|I don't know why some people had trouble following the movie. It is not uncommon for some movies to go back in time and then to current time. It was obvious in this movie, not a problem to me. Quite simply, a Korean man gifted a rifle to a fellow Moroccan hunter, who allowed his young children to use it, unsupervised. Then, when he learned the youngest boy shot an American tourist and she was barely  hanging onto life, the father attempted to disappear with both children. They were caught but the youngest was a bad ass who shot at the police and when they shot back, the good son was shot & killed. Lesson to the father who should have taken responsibility for non-supervision and turned in his son. The tourists' babysitter had good intentions toward the tourists' children but, she used poor judgment and came off as hiding something - pretending to look for a permission letter at the border, instead of just being honest, saying she didn't have one. She should have told them why she took them to Mexico. She knew her nephew was drunk and stupidly took a chance, with two young children who were not hers. He deserted the three in the desert and disappeared. She was caught and deported, after about 7 illegal years in the U.S.  THIS IS A MOVIE about all that went wrong because people did stupid or the wrong thing. The only thing that didn't make any sense to me was why the Korean girl was such a trampy slut. Sure, she lost her mother in her mid teens but, big deal, people lose a parent all the time and don't act like that. Why her father wasn't surprised that she was standing on the balcony completely naked - he should have told her to get some clothes on and been angry that she was behaving that way. The girl was just asking for trouble. It seemed to me that they wanted a naked component to the movie and had time left over so they added the girl. American writers/producers seem so obsessed with showing naked women. Anyway, she was disgusting to watch. The other actors gave great performances.great performances.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie had so much nostalgia of video games which was awesome to see all those characters in one place and along with the amazing story and great personalities Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite movies.
B00797MB0O|4.0|Pathetic storyline about an unhappy woman who doesn't like her life, so she goes out and tries to take what she might have had about 20 years earlier. She goes back to her home town, finds her old high school friends, who are married with families and chooses one boy, who is a married man now with children and she tries to steal him away from his wife. She is pathetically immature and ends up making a food of herself but, not before she blabbers, with fury, to the whole town how she could have had his baby and what they did together when they were younger.  She is very destructive and hurtful along the way, when things don't go her way. I would have felt sorry for her if she hadn't been so destructive. Charlize Theron performed very well but, I'd like to see her in something where she smiles and plays a happy, sweet person for a change. It seems she always plays a bad, angry, destructive, tough character.
B0011ZVTEO|5.0|It brought back that sound  when music was &#34;man-made&#34;!!!, not created from bits and bytes.<br />We need more like that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started reading the first book in the summer and it was recommended that I continue with the other two. What a great read! Loved it!!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I am totally addicted.  Love that you can &#34;write&#34; in your guesses in small numbers and then it shows you any conflicts also.
B00846F1YW|4.0|games were fun but sometimes frustrating.  when you are playing a section with the flashlight feature and try to aim it somewhere, it registers as random taps and penalizes your time.  some objects are hidden in the edges unless you expand the screen.
B008FPOIT6|1.0|I wish I had stopped reading at the title. This novel starts out well. It is set in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, great locations. You really feel like you are there. The main character starts out interesting. However, after I read the Kindle sample and bought the book, it starts to goes down hill and lands at a whimper. It is a story that takes itself too seriously. There is absolutely no irony here. For example, the main female character is this girl (not woman) who works at Google and who worships at the altar of all things Google. I was waiting for the punchline at the end to reveal how utterly naive and stupid this girl was sounding, but unfortunately, this ridiculous idol worship of Google is not revealed or mentioned or alluded to.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved the history , my wife loved the outfits worn by the actors. The entire production made you forget that it was not real. We can't wait for the next season...
1400049628|5.0|My son and I love everything having to do with ZOMBIES. This book is a top notch survival guide should the need arise to fend of these undead.
B0094K1JPC|3.0|This is not a great movie, but I was already vested so I had to watch until the end.  Harrison Ford is not very good in this movie, and I love Harrison Ford so I was dissappointed in his acting.  Rachel Mc Adams lots and lots of energy in this show, and does a good job.  I am glad I did not go to the movies and pay $8 to watch, but okay to watch at home for FREE.
0062202081|3.0|She likes it and that's all that matters. So my son knows how to treat his lady. Bieber Fever still lives at least in 15 year old girls. Ha!
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is very entertaining. The story grabbed me from the start and after seeing both seasons, I can't wait to see more. This is the best I have seen in a long time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can say nothing but good things about the writers of Downton Abbey!  They hit a home run with this one!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I went looking for a good free movie to watch while the kids were napping and struck gold. This is a great pot boiler that takes place in the swamp. Tommy Lee Jones is cast as a recovering alcoholic sheriff with a strong moral compass and intestinal fortitude to deal with some bad dudes. Put in your headphones crack a beer and enjoy the electric mist. You won't be sorry you did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this story. It touched my heart in so many ways. It's one of my favorites now.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|was excelent. I love it the quality and picture was excelent I am very plasee thanks yoy very much woala!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This book was a great read.  I enjoyed getting to know Detective Corey and his engaging wit. Truly a fun book.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Easy read but a bit long with not much happening. Not much of a realistic ending.  Typical weird/disappointing ending to a Sparks book.
0062014536|3.0|I loved the first two books, and in the end of the second when Alex comes back, I was so excited for the third. I  thought Alex would fight for Lena. he ignored her whole time, and in the end nothing was resolved!
B00337KM2S|4.0|The first time I saw this movie, I found it to be so depressing that I thought I would never see it again. After watching it a second time, I appreciate the quality of some of the performances a bit more. This is the story of people who have all sorts of different issues connecting with others. The main character is a severe loner by choice, preferring to live his life &#34;up in the air&#34;. He works for a company that specializes in firing employees for employers that cannot bring themselves to do it. Many of the people he fires have a hard time dealing with the loss of a job because it will have relationship implications, either with family members or because of the severance of a longstanding relationship to their employer. His colleagues, friends and family also have a number of relationship situations that are explored in the movie. The unique thing about this movie is the relentless travel imagery. The movie only stays in one place for a short period before heading off to another airport terminal, rental car depot or hotel lobby. For anyone who has traveled lately, the thought that someone could actually enjoy that kind of lifestyle is probably jarring. The most ironic thing about the film is that this main character whose disconnected lifestyle depends on his ability to connect with the people he is firing in person is threatened with becoming stationary because of a new system in which the company would be able to fire people remotely via the internet. The actors playing the main characters give a pretty convincing performance portraying their character types and there is a pretty impressive array of bit actors who do a good job playing the victims of corporate downsizing. This isn't the kind of move you watch for action, romance or happy endings. It is a movie that leaves a visual impression.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked the format of the book being written as letters to a friend, eventhough it is not clear who the friend is.  I really liked the was the letters explained deep emotions and insecurities.  I guess the letters were to me...the reader.
B003QSLW0K|3.0|Was the overall moral of the movie good? Yes. However, it would be nice if there were more kid friendly movies out that did not also have monster like creatures or scary parts...
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Read again after many years..it was just as great as the first time I read it. Could not put it down
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Josh Groban is well...Josh Groban. Never disappoints, always creates a mood. Very much enjoying the album, and I'm glad I was able to get it at such a good price. Thank you!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I like this app because my granddaughters like drawing and I don't need to supply pen or pencil. also because I don't have to worried about them getting marks on any furniture or on themselves. This app is a furniture saver.
B0013F1D02|4.0|Leaves you feeling good.  Hollywood Should make more like these. Music score was excellent as well as the special effects
B0019HQIGS|5.0|This is a must have for any John Mayer fan. You see John in all 3 of his incarnations as a solo act, John Mayer Trio, and with his band. There is short commentary in between each of the sets with John et al. The commentary is not very enlightening but it does not take away from the production. Overall this is a great concert DVD that you find yourself playing over and over!
B0015DYIH2|2.0|I love this book if you are into  romances than pick this up because once you start you won't stop it is the end to something TRULY SPECIAL
B001NHNG64|4.0|I started reading Lee Child and the Reacher books at the urging of my brother and parents.  Smartly written with strong military influences that are believable. Looking forward to reading the next Reacher adventure!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a harrowing story, and the lead character is played to perfection by Denzel Wahington. So gripping, at points almost like a horror movie. Highly recommended!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This must be one of the best books I have ever read. It's entertaining, well written, and has lots of history without being boring. I strongly recommend it for people who like a nice long book to cuddle up with at night. Money well spent!
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|This movie, while visually stunning, moved very slow, almost boring at times. I don't understand how it won for best movis at the Oscars.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This free download is not worth the time it takes to download it. You are only allowed one game before it requires you to purchase the full game. Daughter hated it.
B000WDS04I|5.0|Funniest sitcom in years.  This season is great<br /> Nph makes this show along with amazon making the entire series affo
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|could be better like always but it is still a good game. but I don't understand whybthere cant be a game like where you don't have to pay for anythingg;(
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have gotten hooked on Downton Abbey. Love, love, love this series.  I am getting caught up on the past Seasons so I will be ready when the new Season starts.
0062082353|5.0|I bought the book to help out the widow and kids, after the tragic death of the author. I also enjoyed the book quite a bit.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great game I love being able to access my game when I have a few minutes.  The greatest thinig in the world is my kindle.
B007E73MSY|5.0|This album is powerful, a bit too aggressive for my style, but yet full of philosophy. Nice riffs, good lyrics. Honestly, I was disappointed by Cavalera Conspiracy album. However, Enslaved is worth buying. I am a listening to Max Cavalera's lyrics and music since 1990 and he shaped my views in many aspects when it comes to music and not only. I listened the album before buying it, I decided to buy it because of the lyrics and the sound. Go for it, if you like Max style.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a very good kept you glued to the book. You didn't  want to put book down. I would read more by this author.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Lots of levels and a great way to pass the time :) Best one I've found yet for a free app
B0092C2X7U|4.0|I really like this game, but it needs more levels and tricks. Like frontflips and twists, then I would give this a five<br />.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Guess the days of Tom Clancy mega novels is over...  Good writing but no different than any other military/spy writer.  Recommend reading just don't expect real Clancy novel.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is such a captivating read. You heart hangs on through the lives of the characters. Your heart is fearful yet softens with true love. Couldn't put the book down until I made it to the very end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just as engaging as &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; from the seventies.  Likable characters--as well as some cads--on all floors.  And a good bit of history as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This will help you to take care of horses you do everything that you would do if you ever get a real horse
B004UXUX7S|5.0|This movie hits many emotions, frustration, sadness, humor, conflict and love. Placed in a beautiful setting a family deals with tragedy, reconnecting, growing closer together and emerge at the end with peace and a clearer understanding of each other.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|hIi love it its so kool its realalistic and AWESOME<br />LOVEEEEE IT SO MUCH ,you can do everything to ur horse
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Loved that Ted - wish I had a playmate like that!  Mila Kunis was wonderful and we will watch it again.  Love, love. love Amazon Prime!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I felt like I could see the emotion expressed by each performer much better than in any other venue - even Carlotta was less a buffoon and more vulnerable. The added features and interviews, where we meet all those who have played phantom before, makes the DVD worth having.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Love this game. It's an old traditional game that's been around for ages. Fun for hours on end for the kids
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Such a great ending to the series- had to read it a second time. It speaks of the baseless and horrors that can be born of that nature we call human,but always gives the reader hope of a brighter day. And I so love the ending.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this digital bible. I makes it so easy to study and I love the easy to read letter size. Would highly recommend to anyone.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I have read other Flynn books and they were more in depth and better. Gone Girl and some of the other books she has written were better.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint and Amy Adams are absolutely wonderful in this movie. He never disappoints after all these years. Very entertaining movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|But then Amazon removed it from the Prime line up. I didn't even get to finish season one :( Seriously guys ?
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I was surprised that we liked this movie as much as the previous ones starring Matt Damon. Great action, acting. Really enjoyed it.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The series has me totally infatuated. I had to own both seasons and I can't wait for season three to begin!
0061900656|4.0|&#34;I'm a Big Brother&#34;/&#34;I'm a Big Sister&#34; is our favorite book for introducing a new sibling. A shocking number of sibling books focus on conflict and loss, which I can totally understand might be necessary for siblings who have been around for a while. When it comes to priming the pump for the introduction of a new baby, however, I prefer Joanna Cole's focus on the joy of a new status, the opportunity to help, and the explanation for some of a newborn's more annoying habits (i.e., &#34;Babies cry to tell us something.&#34;).
B00AG472DS|5.0|Great movie
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Not seen the series yet, just moved and getting settled.  it's the next thing on my list of things to do.  arrived on time and a good price.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|if you are a Whitney Houston fan, you will not be disappointed with this album.  Well worth it!  She still has that golden voice that touches your heart whenever you hear it!
B00846REIS|5.0|If you like the fifty shades series then this is right up your alley. Well written and very believable, I could imagine the scenes as I read them.
B001GQACGO|5.0|If you like Beyonce you will love this album.  Beyonce is very talented and is amazing the world with her abilities.  She is among the best rising stars of the decade!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was very funny and everything backfires. I fell like I want to read another book not kidding it is funny
B005JR4K28|4.0|Funny show. Sometimes a little too in your face. But most of the characters and stories are pretty funny. :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Interesting, just not my particular taste. Don't think I will buy the others. It works for most other women, though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is just soo fun and good to keep up with. Yes some things do cost money but they can also be warned unlike other games that make you buy everthing&hellip;overall this is a great app. I love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic, easy to play, addictive. My niece and I love it!  A definite game to have. You will learn quite a bit about horses.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|A terrific app for people to keep track of the daily stock market changes and trends.<br />Enter your personally owned stock and monitor daily.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This movie had similarities to the book but did not follow it too closely.  Still, we found it to be very suspenseful and exciting.  Didn't move out of our seats until it was over.
B00BHU261S|4.0|I was a big fan growing up in the 60s . If you like his movies this might not be what your looking for but it did give a little insight into what his life may have been like???
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this app may cost a lot but it is one of those apps that are like call of duty for example it has a campaign mode and a multiplayer mode this app is the best
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|pretty good series ,i think the butler did it ? I usually don't follow what the majority watches just not into it ,but this is fair to midland i guess ????
B001NOMNZW|4.0|one disk is extremely scratched and unwatchable. other disk is in perfect condition.  other than that the item was exactly what i wanted.
B00969PR18|4.0|I was surprised to see how few GPS apps their were for the Kindle FHD ? This will do ,,a little disappointed  it does not have a 3d satellite  view ? I am sure its right around the corner though ?
B004XQYBA2|4.0|No problems with this.  Very intuitive. One can spend a great amount of time playing with this while waiting for appointments.
0156013983|4.0|This book is not for a very begginers in french but if have some experience you can start with it. If you love it in english while kid, you will love it the most in french
B004S3MB2U|2.0|This calculator will do practically everything, however, the statistics funtions need instructions.  I have not been able to figure out how to even get a mean on it.  Need to know how to enter and manipulate the data.  Also the same problem with some engineering functions.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Very enjoyable app.  Have listened to it for a few months before giving it a review.  As the days have progressed, it has gradually replaced my shortwave and hd radios with more stations to choose from and no need to play the antenna dance.<br /><br />Works great on the k-fire original.  Can run all day if the battery is fully charged.  I find new, enjoyable, unexpected stations almost every day.  Good sound.<br /><br />The only problem occurs when I fastforward too quickly through my list of saved stations.  The programme freezes.  Just restart your device and remember to wait until the station is fully buffered before moving to another channel and you'll be back to business as usual.<br /><br />Well worth the purchase price.  Give it a try.
0345803485|2.0|I don't like to criticize an author for writing a book because I know how hard it is. But I guess in general I'm not a fan of books that blatantly take characters from another book and use them without changing them enough. And to be quite honest, I was tricked into reading this book by a friend who told me that I would love it. So i downloaded it and read it and I kept waiting for the guy to turn into a vampire and was surprised he didn't. I can understand why a lot of people might really like this book, but it was just definitely not my cup of tea.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Read the book with my daughter and afterwards watched the movie. Fun. Great effects. I definitely recommend this movie!  My daughter is 9 and wasn't scared by the effects - it was a bit intense at times, so younger than 9 could be scared.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I basically enjoyed the story, but it's told in first person by John Corey who interjects a wisecrack after every line of dialog.  It was entertaining for about the first three pages, but after that it became so predictable that it was annoying.
1423140605|5.0|Thank you for sending this book to us right away. We're replacing a damaged book for our school library, and we'll be able to get this popular book back into circulation right away!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book!  The story is wonderfully written.  It's amazing how secrets can change the lives of people around you but in the era of the writing of this book there were so many secrets that many didn't dare speak of.  The saying &#34;the truth will set you free&#34; is true in this story.  But in the era of this book speaking the truth could cost you and your loved ones dearly.  I loved the characters of this book.  Thank you, Kathleen Grissom, for a wonderful book!
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game is great at wasting your time. I would recommend this to any one. it would be better if you would gain xp more quickly.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If you like running, you will love it after you finish this book.  If you're not much of a runner, you will still enjoy this book for its masterful storytelling and colorful characters.  This book reminded me that I was indeed born to run.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Is no longer a memory hog, a bit hard to navigate till you get used to it.<br />I have to say I put it on 'peaceful' and I'm still getting blown up by creepers.<br />But when on the go and need a Minecraft fix, this is just the thing.
B008NAFU9A|3.0|This is a quick little novella and companion piece to Rebecca Hamilton's very popular Forever Girl series. I personally haven't read the series, so the review is based on the novella alone. After doing some research on the series though, it sounds like this is the perfect novella/prequel to the series and I'd highly recommend you read this before embarking on the rest of the books.<br />As for the novella itself, it's a great quick read. I was able to get through it in a few hours while waiting at the doctors office. The story is your typical boy meets girl with a nice HEA. It does have a lot of \\"you need to fulfill your destiny\\" and all the wonderful sacrifice that we love so much in our PNR mixed in, as well as some nice action. All in all, I'd definitely recommend it for fans of Rebecca Hamilton's.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like to read a few passages here and there when out and about, this is the only good Bible app on the market.<br />But it has a downside. They send you emails, even when you mark your profile not to.<br />Also it likes to have a pop up message remind you to read it every so often.<br />Super annoying.<br />Also it tends to lose where you were last after this pop up.<br />If not for its usefulness when looking up something quickly, I'd dump the app.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry Goodkind is a very imaginative author with extremely riveting writing always wanting you to know what's on the next page.  Excellent series and a great addition to anyone's library.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I read these out of order, but it did not matter!<br />Each one is a great stand alone, and just relate to each other in small references.<br />Well written, hold your attention to the very end, and VERY hard to put down.<br />LOVED them!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Would like it more if you could have friends. like on Tiny village.  My Facebook friends don't play<br />That would be awesome.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I'm glad I didn't pay 15 to 20 dollars to see this in the theater, so a few dollars to watch it was not a bad thing.<br />Was enjoyable.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Amazing jaw dropping story. Can read over and over again. Look forward to the rest of the series. Brilliant author.
B000PEX1IE|2.0|In retrospect, it WASN'T THAT GOOD. this movie to me is a prime example of the offspring of coked out Hollywood producers and directors making big budget schlock 4 da masses. Hey, i am just keepin it real. I fondly remember goin 2 see dis back in da day and happily anticipating the song \\"Ghostbusters\\" being played on da radio, but, I don't foresee I will bother sitting through this again anytime soon. Good memories though...
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Love Clancy's style and have never read a book of his that I did not like.  Jack Ryan is another hero in the same mold as Jack Reacher.  Very enjoyable book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play this on a kindle HD. Despite the relatively simplistic concept, Flow has a tendency to become a minor obsession.  Most of the puzzles sort of solve themselves, making levels sort of fly by at times. However, difficult levels have a habit of appearing with alarming frequency and will demand attention from those of us with an obsessive compulsion to complete these sorts of things.  Highly recommended, especially since it's free.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I saw this game as the free app of the day. I figured it was another find the difference game, but I checked it out anyways. When I figured out that it was like the game Slender, I conquered my fears and bought it. I haven't collected any notes simply because I'm scared I'll see Slenderman. But I think the movement is nice, and I like you can choose where to get notes. All and all, great game so far!
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|I'd heard reasonably positive reviews, but I was blown away watching the movie.<br /><br />Subject well handled, OUTSTANDING \\"food porn\\" shots of all the sushi, beautifully shot and edited, great handling of the Tokyo scenery.<br /><br />If you like food, and like to see real passion about food, you'll enjoy this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game EVER!!!!!  I DO not enjoy haters!!!!  Either Shut up or like it. ;) I &lt;3 minecraft!  Thanks Mojang, and for the computer, there the same rate :)
1442359315|5.0|If you have ever lost a family member or friend this book will help you understand where they are and what they are doing now
0988262592|5.0|The Phoenix project is a real life depiction of the struggles that many IT Leaders face with realistic examples to overcome them.  The richness of content, lessons to learn and analogies make it a must read for any senior leader. Like many IT projects the Phoenix Project starts out with a lofty vision (over - committed and underfunded), impossible deadlines, and insurmountable challenges for the hero.  Unlike real life - the heroes are able to implement compelling techniques around DevOps to right size the ship.    The analogies to a factory are so compelling and true to life.  This book was so compelling - not one but two book clubs have been started at my company.  The Phoenix Project contains so many examples and stories that truly show Gene, Kevin, and George - get it!  Any IT professional or Sr. Executive reading it will relate and at times may find themselves wondering if the authors - have been recording their company.    I would highly recommend reading this book for you and your staff!  We are looking forward to applying principles into practice.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|its hard to build buildings but the game is fun if patient..like the dinousars and how u build roads around the park
B002RI98BA|5.0|Saw the movie Lincoln - a bit confused at the beginning, as I knew nothing about the history of the USA. But the film was so powerful and interesting, that I came home and ordered the book on my Kindle. Wow! What research, and how easy to read. The backgrounds of the 'rivals', and of the politics surrounding the slavery problem, particularly after the westward expansion, was fascinating. An amazing piece of history - and frightening to think of the consequences if Lincoln and his team, and their &#34;fixers&#34; had failed. There are not so many true watershed moments in history, but this book certainly captures and disects one of them.
B000P6PVLC|3.0|could be summarized in 15 minutes. too many loose ends. less than impressive role for Brad Pitt. less than average.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I loved this book, I had to keep an eye on the date to see which period in time that they were in.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Love this music, love this gruop, my son loves it too, have in my car and alway a pleasure to listen.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|This CD is every thing you would expect from Puscifer a self proclaimed music collective rather then a band. Great lyrics and wonderful music make magic for any one who wishes to play this collection of thoughts incites and self reflection. This is truly a great group who give their all. This is a keeper!!!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fascinating read, unique and tasteful. Loved it! Highly recommend for those who like adventure, human psychology and animals all woven together in a fascinating fictional tale.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|Every thing you would expect from a project Trent Reznor is part of. Mariqueen Maandig's vocals flow over & into the music . With Atticus Ross & Rob Sheridan the four some weave magic moods with striking imagination. Truly a must have for any one who likes cutting edge music. This is a keeper!!!
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I love this movie, I wanted my husband to watch it with me but there were no closed captioning available with amazon instant video. He couldn't understand what they were saying, the brits!
1616550414|5.0|The book is awesome! No words. If you're a fan of Zelda, or gaming in general, this book is for you.
B009WW1HUY|5.0|First things first, I am not a fan of Indie rock, or any kind of pop.  Specifically I listen to Metalcore and classic rock and blues.  That being said, this album is amazing.  I see everyone singing praises for \\"Its Time\\", I on the other hand found that to be one of worse songs on the album, though still good.  Radioactive, Demons and Bleeding Out are awesome.  I love the whole album, they are so different its refreshing.  I can't wait to see where this band goes from here, and my wife is dying to go to one of their concerts.  Hell, so am I.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My heart skipped a beat when Mary had her baby boy but it also hit the bottom of my stomach when Matthew died. All too bitter sweet.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|Great story! Produced by the same guys who brought us Calendar Girls and The Full Monte. Some of the Manchester accents take a bit of getting used to. Actually this story is based on actual events. It takes all kinds and that means it takes all kinds working together.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Downloaded for Kindle Fire.  Works well.  format is simple.  navigation took a little bit to figure out but that was fairly easy and now not a problem.  I love me some pinterest! :)
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love/hate this book because I\\"'ve read it already and its boring to me so ya .it's pretty boring omg boring
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Downloaded for Kindle Fire.  I never had a chance to really play it.  Even with very strong WiFi it took way too long to load and then once you could actually interact with the horse it was way too laggy.  I uninstalled it after a few days of trying.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Is falling through the ground into a white abyss part of the game? I'm really confused and angry because I had one of the papers left.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is so handy and useful...now I can pin anything to my hearts content on my Android and Tablet.....<br /><br />I'm hooked!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its awasome its  so 3D  its awsome good quality but ther this monkie mutin thing that never dies you get to ride a mine cart
B00000JQFM|5.0|Still a great album now that I have it on CD.  I need more Satriani in my collection!  He's a fabulous guitar player.
B006HL9G10|3.0|Seems okay as a simple timer app, but what is so so special as far as helping you meditate?  Seems pretty worthless in that respect... guess I'm not into meditation.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like this app because of the many selections of courses and they never end. I suggest you get this app.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Really enjoyed the style, and learning about ww1 , from several views of counties .. I didn't finish the book until I ordered the follow up,!!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I fell in love with this show from the very first scene, when Oscar award winner Jim Rash couldn't figure out how to turn off a stereo while giving a introduction speech to new students to Greendale Community College.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this now.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very family friendly!  ...with relationship and moral questions that arise for these great people of adjoining communities. One of the best period pieces I've seen and wonderful to see the things dealt with 100 years ago were not that different from today.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Great acting and fantastic effects! Very exciting and full of humor. A great movie for the entire family. Great picture quality.
B005H9B44A|5.0|If you just want a move that's fun to watch, Thor would fit the bill.  It's not going to be intellectually stimulating, but what super hero movie is?  Thor is eye candy, the fight scenes are fun, and the ending is sweet.  Overall an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The first book was amazing. the second, beautiful darkness, was excellent too... it was just hard in the middle to stay focused. A bit draggy but towards the end it picks up again. I am in the middle of the third book and its just as fantastic as the first. Power through the slower parts and you will be glad you did.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I rented this movie after hearing all of the hype about it, not really knowing all that much about it.  Then I found out it was a true story from declassified files from the government and was stunned.  The news reels made you feel like they were happening right then, not a filmed version.  The movie dragged in spots, I think I expected a bit more action in some parts, but the ending more than made up for it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is fun don't listen to the other people it was ok but when you guy's get to hard levels it gets awesome.lol
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over again and every time it makes me laugh.  Robert Downey, Jr. is outstanding at using his sarcastic whit.  The Hulk, though, is who really made this movie for me.  I laughed until I cried at the scene involving him and Loki.  Here's this big green beast of a guy and I found myself wanting to hug him and then hang out and have a laugh.  This one is a keeper.
B004W4N55C|2.0|This app used to be one of my favorites! It force closes several times during every use on my phone since 4.0 update and has never even opened in my tab running 4.2.
B002C6K7NA|4.0|enjoyed cd I play it  and found no problems will buy again if I need another cd. Tracking info was great.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I absolutely loved book 1 and 2.  Book 3 just didn't hold my interest at all.  Couldn't really get into it but I really did enjoy book 1 and 2.  Loved the movie as well.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|My wife had seen somewhere that this was the movie to see. Maybe for the twisted of mind but not for me. My wife watched it to see if she could somehow feel justified in spending the rental fee. Did not happen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game because it keeps me wondering what's next?its super fun to because it use es spe<br />ed and consentraion.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I have already put this fantastic film in my Top 10 Favs of all time. Life of Pi is a ground breaking film in so many ways. It is disappointing that the Academy couldn't see it...deserved Best Picture Oscar as did it's director Ang Lee...Twice now he has won Best Director and his film has not...\\"go figure???\\"
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Love the show. This is even better. More detail to absorb at a reasonable speed. I recommend even if you've watched the show

B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|If you turn on the fog and image effects, and turn off the lights this can be good for a little scare here and there as tentacle man randomly appears, or you might just fall through an invisible hole in the ground like I did.<br /><br />Even with the short scare here and there, it really does get boring.  Especially when you reach 7/8 pages.<br /><br />All of this makes me sad, beczuse the enviroment is kinda nice, and the controls are actually pretty nice too

B007HC3LHS|5.0|I received this book on a special offer and from reading the blurb about the book was excited to read/listen it.<br />The actuality of the situation was far different when I sat down to listen. If I had known that it was so raw and real I would have never ever have bothered to touch it. If it had been a book in hand I would have burned it.<br /><br />The author told my story; she told the story of so many of us, and she did it with such depth and clarity that I could not sleep for days. I could not shut it off and put it down.<br /><br />I wept at the real life feeling she had portrayed. I smiled at the little glimpses of hope that she slipped into the story.<br /><br />For me this was like looking into a crystal ball and reliving my nightmare and her careful way of sharing steps to recovery from this nightmare gave me hope.

B00499QUK2|3.0|I grew up reading Sherlock Holmes, and I still read all the stories and novels about once a year. I resisted watching this for a long time because I didn't think you could modernize Holmes, and it turns out that I'm right. That being said, this is a good crime show, it just isn't Holmes.<br /><br /> I enjoyed some of the things they did, and there were some very clever moments. Also, I think Martin Freeman may possibly be the best Watson ever. Sadly, they didn't do nearly as well with Moriarity, Mycroft, or Irene Adler. Most importantly, they got the character and personality of Holmes very, very wrong.<br /><br />In essence, they sort of mooshed together \\"CSI\\" and \\"Dexter\\", then splashed in a bit of \\"Doctor Who\\". It's a heady mixture, and it's entertaining, but it ain't Sherlock.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I loved this game it is a great way to kill time while waiting in a doctor's office or anywhere else.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just go this and love it. It;s great  and a lot of fun. I play during my lunch break.  Everyone should try it

B005GUQYIQ|5.0|Only someone who loves cats and lives closely with them could capture their ways in such a delicate drawing.<br />It is amazing what these little beings can do, and even more so the way Simon can put it into paper (or screen).<br />Huge fan from Brazil!
B005HED11Y|4.0|Can't beat the original and the colors just pop out at you. The effects maybe outdated but still a joy to watch
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game can keep you busy,in other words it is time consuming. I play it all the time. My brother and I always compete to see who will get the highest score. But I don't think it deserves the title, THE BEST GAME EVER.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome graphics! This game offers many different options to keep me interested &amp; entertained! I can groom, pet, feed, train, compete, earn,  &amp; more! I'm not even a horse lover, but I love this game!
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|I gave the movie just a couple stars because of the strained acting, and felt like I was watching an info-commercial for joining an &#34;Army of One.&#34; I'd recommend this film for video gamers between the ages of 10 to 30, or big fans of the military. If you like war movies, Band of Brothers makes a lot more sense. If you like thoughtful science-fiction as a genre, look elsewhere.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Great game. Very scary good graphics. My kids love it. And love the different modes you can play will get the others
B001C46P2K|5.0|I have watched the DVD version of The Young Victoria, this movie is good and interested to watch about how Victoria became the Queen of England in the age of 17. The Young Victoria does have it all to be interested to me to watch even on DVD or Blu-Ray Disc, Emily Blunt was still radiant with the beautiful and amazing performance, I do loved this movie, no pros and cons.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It wasn't what I expected. Chris made this book really fun to read.  Not all about the military and also his wife commented.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie gets 5 stars for entertainment, but only one for accuracy. While I don't argue with the addition of dramatic flair (like police cars chasing a plane down the Tarmac--which didn't actually occur), I was offended that the very significant roles of the Canadians and British were not only minimized, but the film suggests that the Canadians only provided a \\"cover\\" for covert CIA action! The film unnecessarily aggrandizes the US; viewers are urged to research the real story instead of this Hollywood version of events.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Sinister Was Seriously Good. If your a fan of horror than this movie is for you! Good Plot and doesn't drag. Do yourself a favor and watch this
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My son pushed me to read this book, he devoured all three and then saved up for the movie.We have a rule in our house, read the book first then you can watch the movie, but I had been putting it off because I felt the book's where geared more toward teens , and they were. But wow ! It has been one of the most creative books I've read in a long while, with lots of twists and turns .I highly recommend this whole set.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack from the movie the Hobbit. A wide variety of instrumental music on most of cds - packaged up nicely.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This shows how our government does not take care do us. When will we ever learn? Big business is controlling our country.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I liked this movie because it was fast paced, and started with action immediately.  The battle scened didn't last fooorevvver!! I hate long battle scenes just kill em and get it over with.  I always like it when we come out on top.  And there were not a lot of gory scenes in it which I like too.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|My wife and I are big Star Trek fans. I give it 5 stars because the movie exciting and action packed.
0547884591|3.0|First of all, I am a big fan of Time Ferris and regularly visit his blog, but tbh. I was a little disappointed with the 4-hour-chef.<br />One thing I took away from the 4HWW was Tim's statement: Sell the customer what they want, but give them what they need.<br />I don't think I got what I needed in the book, though.<br />I am not American, so that might be one extra reason why this book is not what I need, because the book is really just written for Americans (eg. most countries don't allow people to just wander around the forest and hunt animals).<br />The part of the book which I was most interested in and which made me buy it was the META-learning part, since I am quite a good chef already. But also that part disappointed me a little. I think the concept would need some more explanation giving more real world examples, instead of stories. I found it hard taking the concepts (DiSSS and CaFE) and applying them to random thing that I want to learn, just because the process of applying wasn't handled enough in the book.<br />But I have to say, there are some really nice ideas in the book and it's a high quality print for a fair price!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Casual mode was a blessing with hints in a few places. The storyline was interesting. The hog scenes were fairly easy. Gonna play again in harder mode and see if game changes any.
0062238868|5.0|My hubby hasn't put the book down since I ordered it for him. He recommends I read it when he's finished.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Great game, with multiple challenge levels that can't be reached until you conquer the earlier level.  Strategy in determining when, where and how to spend your assets.
B007HB5TN8|5.0|I love this book I read it every once in a while. It's well written, you get to know and like the characters. A good read for young and not so young if you like a good love story (not cheesy).
B0063IH60K|2.0|...the ads are enough to drive one nuts!  You can hardly play the game!  Deleted it from my system!  Be sure to check and see if ads will run with these freebies!  May buy the app.  Well, that's the reason for the ads?  Duh?
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book made me forget about my life. I started reading it and I had a hard time to stop to sleep and work.<br />This is a gripping story. I WILL read it again. Recomended to everybody.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like the challenge in this game. I look forward to playing with my sisters. It will be very competitive.
B005HF0B34|5.0|We enjoyed watching it, and for the most part its somewhat historically accurate. I'm not sure why I ignored this series in the past
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game. Love to play all the time. Can't get enough. Would play all day if I could. Love it.
B005HF0BIE|5.0|We enjoyed watching it, and for the most part its somewhat historically accurate. I'm not sure why I ignored this series in the past
B000BYA4JM|5.0|I love this movie I used to watch it all the time with a friend of mine we know every word to this movie
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This app is great!! It totally works for kindle fire.  You can get pictures from your facebook, or the Internet and you can make a collage on just about anything...or anyone. he he he.
B0084670FU|3.0|Although the story was interesting, compelling and tied in the various lives connected to the event that brought all together in this story, I thought that the sexual content and nudity made watching it a disappointment. I would not recommend it to others for that reason. Otherwise, the story line and the photography was great.
B004P7CMUU|4.0|A study in contradictions; a moving film that doesn't really work, with some of our finest actors pouring their<br />souls into roles they aren't really right for, but touching something human and deep enough to confound the<br />eye-rolling one is tempted to indulge.<br /><br />This is one of those 'failures' that is far more interesting than most successes. A film of ideas, even if some<br />of those ideas are facile or muddled. If it doesn't really work as a treatise on race and racism in America - which<br />on the surface seems it's grand ambition - it does succeed as a May-December romance with between two people<br />who have lost so much that logic is trumped by need.<br /><br />(It's just about impossible to discuss some of the most glaring failures without giving away key plot<br />twists, so I will be circumspect).<br /><br />This is one of those films it would be easy to tear apart, with key scenes and twists that simply don't work. But<br />I didn't find I wanted to. I'd rather remember the moments of human honesty that transcended the flaws. I'll<br />remember Anthony Hopkins dancing, first with Gary Sinese, then later with Nicole Kidman, not the heavy handed and<br />tin-eared social commentary.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The &#34;dancing&#34; part of the book made no sense to me. I am sure in the movie it would be a fun part to watch but seemed silly in the book. It rather ruined it for me. It was just ok for me.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I love the music from the soundtrack of the movie LES MISERABLES. Beautifully done and I feel it has all of the songs from the movie. This was a fantastic movie with superb singing.
0312330537|5.0|This novel takes the reader deep into the Bombay culture, allowing you to feel as though you are experiencing the smells, tastes, sights, and sounds of India at many different levels.
B00457WZEI|3.0|This is a modern day Black Beauty in the trails and tribulations that the story's hero, Joey, must go through. I would also ask the reader to see if they can spot any similarities between Joey and his best friend, Albert. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone, especially the young readers as this book does teach the values of friendship and courage in the face of fire =0)
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This novel takes the reader deep into the Bombay culture, allowing you to feel as though you are experiencing the smells, tastes, sights, and sounds of India at many different levels.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome &amp; so cute,fun,amazingly adorable I think it could be a little bit more entertaining also easier to get the energy back.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The cast of the Downton Abbey take you back in time to experience events of the day through the perspective of both the privileged and their staff.  Watching this series allows you to really get to know the characters and understand their thoughts and feelings.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I could play this all day.  I love the challenge of the game and the different levels.  I would recomend this.
B001TW68P4|5.0|This is a must for fans of the Turtles--all of their great hits and then some. Twenty of their best.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a fantastic show! Can't wait for the next season! I could watch it over and over again and never get tired of it!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Once you start to read Zero Day, it is difficult to put it down. David Baldacci always does a great job!
B008PC1GF8|4.0|This piece of music needs faster tempi, I find. Maybe I am totally off base here, but this recording (which is highly praised by critics) is played too slowly. I make a comparison with Schuricht's recording with the VPO. I simply find Schuricht's style better. Maybe I am not deeply enough into this piece. The sound quality is excellent.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Classic songs on a classic CD. This collection is excellent! If you have never heard Calole King or are rebuilding your music collection, this CD is a great choice.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book was very well written and it captured my imagination well.  I'm not a sci-fi fan but this book will be enjoyed by all age groups.
B00AYB20KI|1.0|The plot was beyond thin. About 20 min in you could see where the film was going. And the main actress acting was under par.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the Bible on my phone. The things that you can read at anytime. Having a Bible verse plan is great. A Reminder of a daily verse and scripture is so nice to have. It's the best app I have on my phone.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|It was a decent movie. The ending will leave you talking with your friends. No spoilers, and Bruce Willas like always is a great action hero.
B0014LX420|3.0|Thought I would try it but I am a classic rock fan. She was pretty hot back then, but fell apart with stardom.
B000SEI230|4.0|Quick easy read, nice romance with a good message even if it was a little trite. Good beach or airplane read.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is pretty fun. Hard to earn gems if you don't want to play other games or buy them. Still not sure how to play the mini games either. I'm still learning but so far it has been pretty fun.
B008220DGE|1.0|Talent-laden film with some showy performances, but nowhere to really take things.  No story arc, no real sense of subjectivity.  Best thing was the surprisingly spry soundtract (as expected from a Radiohead-ite).  Not in the same discussion as &#34;There Will Be Blood,&#34; which was a true &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;-like classic.
B00820N2JG|4.0|Love this movie, so many funny adult one liners. Must see, but not for weak of humor. Enjoy with friends or family for sure, silly to laugh alone
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Terrible - script was awful, what's with the stupid make-up and performances are too serious for a crappy movie which made it NO FUN.  Ridiculous, dumb premise.  I'm glad books get people reading, but if the book was the same, no wonder we lag behind the industrialized world in literacy.  Also, and this bugged me alot, wasn't this just a re-write of Battle Royale (which was much better plotted, paced and acted) and Running Man.  Stanley Tucci, say it isn't so.  From First Night to this?
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|For the kids at heart who loves dinosaurs, and life creator games, this ones for you. love it. great contents.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is great i just loved it .it is so much better than temple run. the Easter egg hunt is fantastic.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Sucks. to much down loading.  I can't even get into the game. I don't. even know what it looks like.
B00ABO573A|5.0|\\"Keep The Lights On\\" speaks to those who have loved but who have had to step away, as painful as it may be.  Real life and real emotion are depicted in striking detail.  Kudos to the Actors, the Director and Cinematographer for a wonderful, heartfelt film.
B0081BU42O|3.0|The themes and tropes making up The Hydrogen Sonata will undoubtedly be familiar to those already well-acquainted with the Culture series of books. The friendly rival civilization (Gzilt), its convoluted internal politics, the Blue and Orange morality of the hyper-intelligent ship Minds, the reluctant protagonist human along for the ride, the lower-tech civilizations on the sidelines, the awesome but often incredibly bizarre body modifications, and a great many \\"survive while the ship's out of range\\" adventures that are the staple of so many high-tech space operas. It's all there, and yet, it somehow doesn't really seem to come together in this one.<br /><br />The plot elements offer great potential: An equally-advanced civilization with completely different principles, a shadowy government conspiracy/cover-up, an impending Sublime (Banks' version of the \\"ascension\\") partially motivated by a religious tome that consistently predicts the future, an allegedly-ancient Culture citizen being hunted across the galaxy for his memories, and rumours of meddling by a pioneering civilization on a scale that would make the Culture's Special Circumstances organization's most brilliant interventions look like lame college pranks. You'd think that this would be the equation for an amazing story, and yet somehow Banks manages the equally-impressive feat of also making us not really care.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that a lot of the more interesting elements above just aren't really developed. Character development is, as always with Banks, a solid A+, but plot development seems to focus mostly on various chases and skirmishes and on the repartee of the Minds, the latter of which was novel fun in Excession but is just the same old stuff here. The conspiracy arc sheds new light on the Culture's early choice to let AIs run the show, but the conspiracy itself still feels weakly motivated, poorly executed, and totally unresolved. The big \\"secret\\", both before and after we find out what it really is, hardly even seems worth guarding.<br /><br />Most disappointing, however, is that we are continually reminded throughout the book that probably none of it matters because of the Subliming - expecting, of course, some clever twist to turn that theory on its head - but the twist never comes. Its absence in a book that desperately needed one is conspicuous from an author and a series that is notorious for them. I was expecting some relevation, or at least something to make me think, but my only thought was... \\"what? That's it?\\" It's like the author finally got tired of the story and just gave up.<br /><br />I might have given this 4 stars as a standalone book, but as a Culture entry it really only deserves 3. It was less dry and meandering than Consider Phlebas, but nowhere near as satisfying as his other recent books, especially [[ASIN:0743421922 Look to Windward]] and [[ASIN:1841498939 Surface Detail]].
B0091W5UWG|4.0|Sound and audio is good. Songs are the best feature of the story. Worth watching again. Acting is about medium.
B009AOFNU4|5.0|Awesome controller and works well with my old school ios emulator games for SNES, NES, Sega, N64 and more.<br /><br />Pro<br />works very well with games with smooth setup<br />comes with carry case<br />not that large so easy to carry with ipad or tablet<br /><br />con<br />none cause i have small hands so it works perfectly<br />money is not a issue as you only want to buy a controller once and this one is perfect for such a buy<br />SO NO CONS FROM ME<br /><br />remember you only want to buy a controller once and i recommend this to anyone with a ios that is looking for a controller
B000URWYTS|5.0|It was a surprise to know the story of Frank Lloyd Wright, as I have always been impresses and enjoyed his work. It's a shame his fame didn't happen until he died, even though everyone knew he had a unique talent and was way before his time. Would have loved to meet and talk with him. Enjoyed the book immensely
B00A77II0U|5.0|These games can be so addicting! A lot of fun and great graphics and storyline. I would recommend this game to a friend but it creeped my little boy out just to hear the music.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Easy reading and hard to put down. Loved the Book Thief and it reminded us of all the tragidies of the Holocaust. Spellbounding.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is a scary but fun game I approve just don't play in the dark you make that mistake once!
B008RLTUUA|3.0|This book is extremely well documented. This is its greatest strength and weakness. Few will bother to check the references but at least, like a simpler book such as &#34;How to Lie with Statistics&#34; would teach you, you will know enough not to trust Big Pharma. The LEGAL mandate for any CEO is to ensure that the company makes money - period. Yes, you can be disingenuous, greedy, crooked and as we have seen with the great Wall Street scandals, the chance of your being prosecuted for your crimes is as rare as a Higgs boson.<br /><br />The book is BORING. I suggest you check out the &#34;Look Inside&#34; feature &#34;Surprise me&#34; and see if you really want to buy this book.<br /><br />All that said, there are probably some great life saving drugs made by Big Pharma. But how do you know which ones, when Big Pharma often uses only that data that helps it market its drugs? If you take a witches brew of &#34;life saving&#34; meds like I do, well sometimes ignorance is bliss.<br /><br />The best reason to buy it is to reward the author for his many long hours of research.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I love the bundle, just skipping from one book to the next with nary a pause in between...The only thing that's a bit of a drawback is the inability to easily flip back an forth from the point you're at reading and the maps or appendix in the front and back. But that's more a thing with a kindle than the book itself.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book. It was a real page turner.<br />The characters were excellent. Wish they were a little older than HS but all the same it was a great beach read.
B00122O34O|5.0|This is a great soundtrack.  I cannot be clear enough about that-- the music is great for working, or driving, or running.  It's quirky, folksy, happy day music.  I bought it right after the movie came out on DVD, but somehow it was lost during a move.  I couldn't live without it (and hadn't put it on my new computer yet) so I bought it again.  If somehow it disappears once more, I would gladly shell out the money to purchase it a third time.  It is truly excellent!
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Great quality and great movie. My kids love it.... We have bought a lot of movies off of Amazon Instant Video and all the movies turn out great! A+
0393343405|4.0|I loved the way the book began with a sense of mystery, which kept me captivated and made me want to read on. It was a great way to get one's attention into what later became a serious historical narrative and/or the author's personal perspective.  Although, as a Social Studies major and long time history teacher, I was familiar with most of the matter and topics he covered, I found Greenblatt's presentation to be fun and quite spellbinding. Of course, all cannot be taken at face value as this is a historical novel. Nevertheless, I liked the way the subject matter was presented. At the same time, I agreee with some critics that there are far better and more accurate historical accounts of the poem, naturalism, and that time period, I found Greenblatt's book highly enjoyable to read, but do plan to read more on the subject from other authors. In the meantime, I think this is a fun book and I have already shared it with friends.

B0044DE906|3.0|Freedom depends upon a frame of reference.  It is a relative concept. Empathy with the struggles that animate Mr. Franzen's latest novel also depends upon a frame of reference.  On the tragic continuum of human suffering the bored neurosis and petty jealousies that propel the novel forward rank somewhere between a kidney stone and stubbing one's toe.  A whole novel based on the problems of the rich and the self-consumed.  That being said, Patty and Walter are likable, realistic characters.  Freedom, the novel, is post-modern angst and malaise captured with all the fervor of the crusading Realists of the Gilded Age.  Franzen's art is very good at imitating life. Maybe it is time for realism to graduate to a whole new class of problems...if only for outstanding attendance.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|Great show I recommended it to most of my friends and family and they all love it as well. It would be the second best crime drama next to The Wire.
B00338QENI|3.0|Almost overwhelming amounts of data and I appreciate the research involved in putting this date into a book.  I didn't find it to be a &#34;page-turner&#34;, but enjoyed the book, and learned many things from it.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I would recommend anything by Stephen King. He is one of my favorite authors. I wish all of his books were available for kindles
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I loved to book. Might be a little too technical for some. But all on all a very good story. Well written.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app restaurant story it brings people real people from around the world together in love and supporting each other with help lol only if real was that simple :-)<br />Thanks so much.For making this great app game.
B007FH9GA6|1.0|If you like watching the movie where everybody is tortured, tied and processed with dildo this move is definitely for you.<br />I am not that advanced and that move made me sick and willing to throw up.<br />If I could give it *star minus*- I would.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is worth your time and money if you love scary games and you know who the slender man is. This game keeps you wondering where the slender man is while you collect the 8 pages. It's bounderies are small, but it IS worth it.
B004GYY714|5.0|this is a world wide radio app. good for music radio, not so much for talk radio though, but just music
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This a really good game but it has a few problems however I'm confident that they will be fixed in updates. It's a brilliant adaptation of the PC game and I'll enjoy playing it, it works brilliantly with my Kindle fire HD with the surround sounds and epic lens flares<br />Here's a list of the problems:<br />It needs to be darker, maybe a torch would help make it more scary<br />The levels are too open air, although I do like all the hills and visible landmarks, the fire really caught my eye!<br />The slenderman needs better mechanics.<br />Needs more sounds.<br />Less obvious places for the pages.<br />Perhaps it could work with the game centre thingy the kindle has, with achievements and stuff.
0765325950|5.0|This book has been long awaited for and greatly anticipated. And I read it in about 48 hours of course neglecting all other responsibilities (unfortunately). Awesome!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game. The controls moved very well and I was pleasantly scared of Slenderman in just a few moves. The scenery is appropriately weird and spooky also. I highly recommend this game...<br /><br />Gaston Sanders, Author of:<br />[[ASIN:B00AN9H3KS Princess Grace and the Dragon]], [[ASIN:B00AR9TCJY Cole's Fairyland Adventure]],<br />[[ASIN:B00B4KBVJ4 Sirus Toad and the Grumpy Troll]], and [[ASIN:B00AR639KU The Mystery of the Missing Homework]].
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It took 35 chapters to get interesting.  Don't know why I kt reading except that John Grisham is a favorite. Thank goodness I had this from s public library and had not spent money to purchase it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is an awesome and fun game for a kid to play I also like that it is a worldtour and it is really fun
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|this game is creepy!!!! i got to 7/8  pictures and i turned around and saw him with his spider legs out i screamed bloody freakin murder!!!!!  then i ran and i found the last page in the broken burnt cabin and won!!!!!!  it was scary though!!!!!
B000TDG9D0|5.0|This was one of my favorites in the late 80s.  I am so happy to have it back in my collection again.  As soon as the music turned on my feet started moving.  All of Tina's best are on this CD!!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I'm getting to be a bigger and bigger fan of Tom Cruise... this movie helped.  Tom is an excellent actor and he did the movie justice.  I knew nothing about Jack Reacher previous to the movie so I didn't know that Tom didn't fit the profile... it doesn't even matter because he was GREAT as the character.  It's an excellent movie... believable action scenes, lots of twists and turns... laced with some funny stuff, too!  Good plot.  Highly recommended that you see it.  I'm looking forward to seeing it again and owning it!  10/10/2015: I recently re-watched this movie.  I STILL think Tom did an excellent job!  I enjoyed the movie just as much or more than the first time I watched it!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|this was a great little movie but not for kids.  very vulgar. but i thought it was hilarious. thats it
B004WR125O|5.0|Tiny dongle does what it says it would do - connect the Onkyo A/V unit to the network and internet. No trouble to sign in to the network. Saves having to run ethernet through walls.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I chose the best exotic marigold hotel  because is had a great story.  but the director did not give the actors enough depth.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|A very moving drama, based on actual facts. Very well played by Sarah (the child) and Kristin Scott Thomas. I have given both the book and the DVD to many of my family and friends
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|nothing to say. the movie was terrible.no interest what so ever.  hard to follow. In fact I liked the other 007 movie with Daniel Craig
B00466HM28|5.0|It works perfectly. It is portable but not tiny, feels fine to play even with bigger hands. Many youtube videos are available on how to use it, which is nice. Great price for all of the features and capabilities you get with this handy tool.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|Purchased to replace a lost one. Plantronics current version does not have a belt clip like the old case. Bring it back. People that have the old one in stock are getting $30, that should tell you something.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great game for passing time while waiting in a doctors office or just to kill time. I have enjoyed all the angry birds games
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Yes, the movie was engaging and built tension.  It also did so artificially.  Case in point:  it was the Canadian Ambassador who deserves the real kudos for bravery.  The film treats him as an accessory.  The final sequence of the escape from Iran was simply absurd.  Really..... police cars chasing and keeping up with a 747 on its takeoff roll?  Since when does a police sedan accelerate to more than 200 miles per hour?  And, of course, why chase in a car instead of call the control tower?  Sorry, Affleck, we're not that dumb.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book is so disturbing.  If you've seen the movie, you know why!  Very well written and spell binding, but whew!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|An interesting excursion into an after-death experience bolstered by the medical qualifications of the writer.  Unlikely to prove a life changing experience for most readers but comes across as an honest account of what Dr Alexander recalls from the time he was in a coma. Worth reading and worth keeping in mind.
B000000XBB|5.0|What a great album of music for the soul. So many heard it but did not<br />get back to play it like I am doing.<br />Very sad to think this was for the 1%.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Its a good game with a great story and plenty of twists and turns that will keep u guessing and jumping...lol
B002EEYAQK|5.0|A very good album from the past when music made sense. Packaged very good between a few<br />sheets of cardboard and taped real good.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Good graphics and tricky playing. Don't care for the monkey part but the others I have tried are great. Would recommend you try it do yourself.
1781163243|5.0|awesome!!!! an item every true HALO fan must have, amazing Halo universe art, you won't regret it, buy it buy it buy it
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Good value ...DVD was more expensive...download on highest quality took about an hour but it was excellent and worth the wait. Will definitely try again.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|So far there is nothing inappropriate for little kids, unlike the movie. It's a building game were you do things to earn money, find Amber, make dinosaurs, and enlarge the park. You could use actual money to spread things up, but not necessary. Overall fun and safe app for kids and adults.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|leps world 2 is like super Mario only with a cool little lepercon dude.best free game ive ever played.if fact I wish I playing it right now, only it was so good I had to stop to express how good it is. thank you to who ever created this!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The episode \\"clear\\" was one of the best shows ever! This series is absolutely awesome!  I have enjoyed every season, but it just gets better and better!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of those books that goes down easy, and has you wishing for another helping.  Logical, interesting, adventure, suspense... check, check, check, and check.
0062082353|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down once I got started! I am not much of a reader. I read some magazines from time to time and then I usually only read the few sections I am interested in. This book had my attention the whole way thru. It is not just about all of the insurgents he took out, but much about Chris and who he was and what made him. I would reccomend this book to anyone who would just like to have some good to read, or you just want to gain some understanding of what some of our brave soldiers go thru.<br /><br />Great book! I will be getting any other books he has written.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Great book, still remembering the characters.  Larger than life writing, much the same as Game of Thrones, the characters are really CHARACTERS.
145210655X|4.0|My boyfriend loves Star Wars, so for fathers day I got him this cute book for him and his daughter to share. He loved it!
B009X01ELC|5.0|I like the way it stands and rotates from landscape to portrait. However it is a little cumbersome to rotate
B0044C3RB4|4.0|Don't like the gross factor. In this season, I also don't like how they messed with the main characters. The chemistry between them was the main driving factor for my watching this show. However, the acting was amazing and the story continued to develop in interesting ways.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game would definitely recommend this game to anyone who would ask me about it wish I would have played earlier
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very nice. I wish it was easier to get gems, though. Everything costs so many of them.
0345803493|5.0|Very hot reading. Second one was the best.mthird was very predictable. Funny everyone is now writing these type books. Guess that's why they callit mommy porn.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|There is no better game to have to have for any age it's the best in the damn world you will love it
B00003INJ6|4.0|I know this is 1968, but the organ on every song?  Didn't  synths come into being yet. I don't think Jon Lord played anything but organ on any Deep Purple album. Richie was a great guitar player even then. I like the singer in this line-up better than the others (Sorry Ian).  I heard he wanted to sing like Elvis!  Can't you hear the ch'all in &#34;Hush&#34;?
B001ANYDAO|4.0|A good read , gets you excited to work hard. I enjoyed it more than blink by Malcolm Gladwell. The last 2  chapters were a bit boring thought
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Get back to prog roots. I believe prog rock should be relaxing and soothing, but also a bit dark. That's what Genesis and Alan Parsons did for me when i first heard the term. This album is the best for Riverside and it does the same to me as early prog. No screaming or metal. The second disk is great instrumental prog. Listen to it while going to sleep!
1616550414|5.0|If you like the Zelda Games, i recommend this book, you´re love it, this contain a hundred of pics and information about this wonderful franchise, this is a MUST HAVE
B00A6HHJ9C|4.0|Steve has always been one of my guitar heroes. Some of these songs have explicit lyrics, but the last instrumental  &#34;Smile&#34; from the 30s or 40s was a nice touch for his mother, .
B001HN697M|4.0|This is one movie I held off buying at first, as I thought the female role of Selene was being played by another actress.  After watching it I found this was not the case at all...but rather the movie is pre Selene chronicling the rise of the Lycans; and the forbidden love between their leader Lucian (Michael Sheen) and Victor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra).  The special visual effects used in this movie are outstanding to say the least...making you feel like you're right there running with the Lycans through the forest or part of a Vampire-Lycan battle.  Great acting by all, though I believe Michael Sheen and Rhona Mitra pretty much stole the show!<br />*You may want to consider purchasing the Underworld Trilogy, which includes all but the last movie Underworld: Awakening.  A much better buy for the money!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This James Bond was action packed from the beginning, with a twist at the end.  Great show, fun to watch.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|The humans have discovered the existence of Vampires and Lycans...and are out to eradicate both species from the population.  At the same time the Vampires and Lycans are still at war with each other, though that ongoing battle is about to change, as the Lycan Doctors sre developing a serum to make their species much larger and powerful than before, impervious to any weapon possessed by the Vampires or Humans.  The serum has properties found in both Vampire and Lycan blood.  The blood is being taken from Seline's child, who was removed from the pregnant Seline while she and Michael remained in a state of suspended animation, in a well guarded Lycan Laboratory.  Seline escapes from the Lycans and eventually meets up with her daughter, who together with the aid of another Vampire and a Police Detective try to prevent the Lycans further development and distribution of the serum throughout their clan.  The viewer can find out what happens next for him or herself!  Another homerun For Kate Beckinsale!
B0042UEU8M|4.0|Tender all around love story. Timeless family love bonds and just enough romance to complete the story line. Good watching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this GAME!!<br />Absolutely wonderful&hellip; :) graphics are great and the interaction is amazing. Makes me miss my horses back home.
0345803485|2.0|Laying perfectly splendorous in my line of sight are three freshly baked glazed donuts.<br /><br /> I eye each one carefully, admiring their inherently voluptuous \\"O\\" shape. I trace my index finger slowly across the surface of the first donut, leaving a trail in its wake, and shiver in delight. The sensation of the warm glaze as it blobs up into a sugary ball on my fingertip is thrilling. Without pause, I pop my finger into my mouth, testing the flavor. My sleeping taste buds are immediately sent dancing and my eyes flutter shut.\\"This donut...it tastes so damn good.\\"<br /><br /> Before I know what I'm doing, I'm holding the entire donut in my fist, and I shovel it into my mouth greedily. My teeth sink deliciously into its soft, doughy flesh and a wave of steam is released from its purgatory; the tendrils rise to my nostrils and bring an overpowering sweet scent with them, sending me reeling. The dough is warm, soft and yielding to my teeth and my tongue.  The glaze is like unicorn semen in my mouth. Endorphins are immediately released in my brain and my pleasure center is on fire with activity as I sensually devour the donut. I let the sugar and calories swallow me, consume me, until I am no longer myself. I am one with the donut. I belong to the donut.<br /><br /> I lick my fingers, savoring the remnants of glaze on my fingertips, and realize there are two more donuts left. My blood sugar suddenly spikes, and I feel vaguely light-headed. Whoa. Maybe I should wait.<br /><br /> 'You can't wait,' my subconscious urges me, still reigned in by the power of the donut I just ate. \\"Eat one more. Just one more. You can do it. You want this.\\"<br /><br /> I wrestle with the idea for a few moments more, realizing my fingertips are turning pruney from sucking the now non-existent glaze off them. Despite my better judgment, I realize then that I have no choice but to eat the next donut.<br /><br /> My teeth slice through the belly of the second donut with less ease this time, but I've convinced myself that it's still a rewarding experience. The warmth of this donut seems to be dissipating more quickly than the last. The glaze begins to harden and flake. I realize now that I wish I'd gotten three different types of donuts, perhaps a Boston cream and a jelly-filled to break up the monotony.<br /><br /> An incalculable amount of time passes. My lover lifts his sleep-mask from his eyes and says, \\"Baby, you've been eating that donut for 6 hours straight. Please come to bed.\\" My concentration is interrupted and my body curls protectively over the donut. My lips tighten over my teeth into a menacing snarl. \\"Noooooo, it'ssssss mine,\\" I hiss, vaguely aware that I must look/sound like Gollum from Lord of the Rings, but I don't care. My mind is brimming with the cheap sugar high and even though I know I should stop eating, I simply can't. I've come too far to stop now.<br /><br /> I eventually finish the last morsel of the second donut, shakily pressing it between my lips and vaguely moving my mouth in a chewing motion. The bit has become hard and tasteless in my mouth, but I force myself to swallow. Once that remnant has disappeared  into my protesting belly, my wide, addicted eyes shift to the elephant in the room: THE LAST DONUT.<br /><br /> My blood sugar level is at its max and I can feel the effects possessing me. My body is shaking. My eyes are twitching. My tongue is numb from the taste. Every fiber of my being is telling me no, that no good can come from eating this third donut, but my hand acts on its own accord and scoops the waiting donut from its resting place, and raises it shakily to my hesitant face-hole. My lover watches me from afar, concern etched on his face. \\"Maybe you should set that donut back down. When was the last time you slept, or showered?\\" I pay him no heed as the brunt of the third donut forces its way past my glazed-speckled lips.<br /><br /> Even as I'm being wheeled to the ER in a hospital bed on wheels, I can't stop. I clutch the latter half of the third donut to my chest, which is difficult as my entire body is convulsing. A nurse attempts to pluck the donut from my hand when she thinks I'm not looking, but I have a vice-like grip. I growl in my throat and make a swipe at her with my free hand. It's a warning. Hands off my donut, bitch.<br /><br /> I raise my donut-laden hand up to my mouth despite the worried glares from the hospital staff as they try to get me under control. I've been hooked up to an IV to get my sugar levels more stable, but it does no good. The donut is crusty and hardened like a hockey puck. The taste no longer brings me any joy, but I gnaw off a small piece and attempt to chew out of habit. The bit clinks and clangs down my esophagus like a hunk metal and lands with a hard \\"THUD!\\" in my overburdened belly. The sensation is uncomfortable, even painful, but for some reason I just can't stop myself, and nobody else can stop me, either. I bite off the next hunk and grumble my disgust at the mix of old, crystallized sugar and rock-solid dough that simply doesn't want to be chewed. I start swallowing whole pieces without chewing because the act has become impossible. Gruelingly, I make my way through the rest of  the third donut, my body shaking so bad I can't help but think that I must look like an over-sized vibrator. My teeth work like saws though the hardened substance as I continue to swallow without chewing. By the time I manage to choke down the last bite, my blood sugar level has spiraled out of control and I realize the world has been put on a dimmer. The lights go out and I haven't the slightest idea if I'll wake again.<br /><br /> But I do wake up, my levels are stabilized, and the donuts are gone. Thank the Gods, the donuts are gone.<br /><br /> My first action after waking from my sugar-induced coma is to write this review. The first donut seemed good. The second one was starting to become stale and monotonous but somehow managed to hold me in. And the third one just pushed me over the edge. All that sugar-coating and fluff just hardened and became contemptible after awhile. Yet for some unholy reason, I couldn't stop.<br /><br /> And this, ladies and gentlemen, concludes my review of the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy..

B00AHTYGRW|1.0|I probably would have never watched this movie if it had not won the 2013 Oscar for Best Picture, since for me \\"Les Miserables\\" was by far the most deserving movie.  Even \\"Lincoln\\" would have been more deserving.<br /><br />So I downloaded this movie via eMule.  That's right, I wasn't going to give up any real money to watch this fraud of a movie, I just wanted to see what the hoopla was all about.  And I do believe in supporting movies that I really like, often buying all the DVD/Blu-ray, high definition etc., versions of the movies that I truly love.  \\"Les Mis\\" is going to get my money.<br /><br />The biggest strike against \\"Argo\\" is that it is a completely false re-write of the real history of what happened.  Yes, Hollywood does that, and it is called artistic license, but the clear cut self-congratulatory effort to hugely inflate the role of Hollywood in the story, while downplaying the role of the Canadians and inserting false slams against some of our allies made this movie unworthy to even be considered as a Best Picture candidate.<br /><br />Entertainment value?  Meh.  Just another caper movie.  Not one of my favorite kinds of movies.  Again, unworthy of a Best Picture nomination.<br /><br />OK, so maybe this movie doesn't deserve a one star rating just on its merits as a mildly interesting caper movie with a terrible distortion of history, but it deserves its one star for having campaigned to get an Oscar for Best Picture.<br /><br />It is simply beyond my understanding why Hollywood keeps doing this - all it does is totally discredit the Oscar award as a legitimate award with any meaning.<br /><br />A previous example of the Oscar going to an undeserving picture was when \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" won Best Picture over  \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" for Best Picture in 1999.<br /><br />Now, I did sort of like \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", but seriously, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"  will go down in history as a landmark war movie, one of the best of all time, whereas nobody will remember the lightweight fluff of \\"Shakespeare in Love\\".<br /><br />A worse fate awaits \\"Argo\\", an utterly forgettable caper movie filled with badly re-written history, winning the Oscar for Best Picture only because of the internal politicking of the Academy and its propensity for self-congratulation.ember the lightweight fluff of \\"Shakespeare in Love\\".<br /><br />A worse fate awaits \\"Argo\\", an utterly forgettable caper movie filled with badly re-written history, winning the Oscar for Best Picture only because of the internal politicking of the Academy and its propensity for self-congratulation.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This movie has impacted my belief in spirit.  It's a wonderful movie about love, family, and the spiritual bonds among each person separately and altogether in a family.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I watched this on my TV over Roku.<br /><br />If you typically have excellent playback experience with your setup, then I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />For me it was the typical amazon playback experience, the movie stalled about 2/3 of the way in. I had to unplug my roku and my router so that amazon would quit trying to stream nothing to me.<br /><br />The maddening thing is this never happens on Netflix over Roku, and Netflix uses Amazon's network. Netflix is better at using Amazon's network than Amazon.<br /><br />Sometimes playback is OK on Amazon over Roku for me, which is why I bothered, but I got unlucky this time.
B0086700CM|5.0|i heard my friends talking about this game at work and had to find out for myself what all the hype was about. my kids and i enjoy playing it. once you start, you don't want to stop.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|You would think that people read reviews before they choose what book to read. Well, not me. I read the reviews of a book only after I have read it, because I'm so curious to see what other people think about it. Usually, this only happens with books I absolutely loved, and \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" is one of them. It has mixed reviews, but most of them are positive, if not raving. I'm going to tell you now that mine is going to be raving because I loved, loved, loved this book! However, I do agree that those who gave it only 1 or 2 stars have a point. There were unrealistic and rather forced situations and coincidences, but let me tell you this: \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" is a page-turner. After I finished reading it, my first thought was: this is how you write a best-seller. I am willing to leave all the unrealistic aspects aside, even completely forget about them, because this book kept me engaged until the last page.<br /><br />First, it is based on an interesting premise: what if you woke up every morning with no memories of the last 20 years of your life? What if every day you had to learn that you are in your forties, not twenties, that you are married, and you suffered an accident that prevents you from keeping new memories for more than one day? Sounds scary, huh? Christine wakes up every morning in bed with a man she doesn't know, then spends her entire day learning about herself and her life, and when she finally thinks she understands her situation, she goes to sleep knowing that her brain will reset during the night, and the next morning she will go through the same process. No yesterday and no tomorrow. She only has today.<br /><br />The main idea of the novel gives so many possibilities for the action. And because every time I read a mystery/suspense I try to find out the secret before the characters, while reading this novel I took into consideration every single possibility I could think of. Of course, I eventually guessed because, after all, the novel is written after a well-known recipe that involves someone who is not who we think he/she is, and a major twist at the end, that will turn everything we thought we knew upside down. When I read this kind of novels, my principle is: don't take anything for granted. Somehow, this is fun because I turn the reading into a game, but, on the other hand, it's unsatisfactory, because the ending has fewer chances to surprise me. So, I won't say that the ending of \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\", the great revelation, surprised me, as I had taken that possibility into consideration. But I sure enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />I think the strongest point of this novel was the unreliable narrator. I love unreliable narrators! They're so fun to read and such a challenge sometimes. It was interesting to follow Christine as she was trying to learn more about herself and her past, at the same time being perfectly aware that she was probably getting most things wrong. You get excited about every new discovery she makes, and then you have to remind yourself that it's probably a lie. She can only trust the people around her to tell her what happened that made her lose her memory, but not all of them are trustworthy. Then, her condition makes her mix up memories with imagination. All these elements turn \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" into an exciting read. I couldn't wait to grab my Kindle whenever I had some free minutes to see what happened next, if the next clue would help me solve the mystery before her.<br /><br />I will definitely recommend this novel to everyone I know that I think will enjoy it. Reading the reviews, I saw that some people found it slow and others couldn't get past the unrealistic and convenient situations. I wouldn't say that it was slow, although there were times when I wanted things to happen faster. It wasn't because the action dragged, but because I was eager to find out more about Christine. So no, the novel was not slow, it was just the author building up the suspense. And he did it quite well. Again, I won't deny the unrealistic aspects of the plot, but I give it 5 stars because it kept me glued to the pages, because it was so enjoyable and well-thought that I just didn't care that some things were exaggerated and unlikely to happen in real life.d it quite well.

B000I3PERS|5.0|I love this movie..probably the best Mel Gibson movie before he went all wacko.<br />Wish he had made more like this.

1432794426|5.0|I give Defending A King- His Life and Legacy a 5 star rating because I enjoy reading about Michael Jackson, but the best part of reading someones work on him is reading POSITIVE things. This book contains a great deal of positive information about Michaels life as an entertainer, and his life as a man, father, brother, son, boss and friend. I read information I already knew, but I also read information I didn't know. For instance, I didn't know Michael loved classical music. I love classical music myself, and I often think now and have thought in the past what a wonderful person Michael Jackson was. Not because he loved classical music as I do, but because of what type of person he was. Intelligent, caring, loving, kind, gentle, generous and thoughtful to a fault. That is how I would describe Michael Jackson. I think Karen Moriarty did a great job in sharing with the world her view of the best entertainer IN the world. Thank you Karen for this book. I loved it and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning new and wonderful things about OUR Michael Jackson!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Heart-wrenching, funny, amazing, miraculous, inspiring - you could go on and on about the ways one could view the life of Adam Brown. That I could have a fraction of his faith, strength and love....
B008ASLK8A|3.0|What is it with Hollywood. Why can't they be satisfied with the original success and go on to the next ORIGINAL project.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a concise book that encompasses all you need to know about nurtrition, supplementation and weight training. It might seem a little daunting to follow all the advice (multiple small meals a day, targeting specific muscles per day, supplements and timing, etc). I suspect applying even some of Matthews' ideas will produce desirable results. His view that one should lift heavier for fewer reps (while not a novel concept) does fly in the face of some accepted dogma, espoused by less thoughtful trainers. The bonus report at the end is worth the price of the book, which is a bargain anyway.
B0079ZWGVU|5.0|I really liked this book.<br />It's very fast-paced, every chapters is a different scene and gives you a different perspective in the story.<br />I loved the main character, he is anonymous 100%, every time you were about to get a name or a description of him something took the possibility away, which kept me wanting more, just to know more about him and his past and why he is the way he is. Besides he is so anonymous that you can keep putting Ryan Gosling's face as Driver and that makes it oh so sexy, because you know... he is just drop dead hot.<br />The movie changes a lot of details but overall is good, I really liked it as well.<br />So, go read!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|A visual and spiritual adventure of the highest order. It stirred my spirit and my soul. I am better for having watched it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Just a good funny movie my daughter loves it!  We have watched it at least 5 times and it is still funny~
1439153663|4.0|Although the story is not  a pleasant one, this book held my interest.  It is told in two voices: Lavinia, an Irish girl, and Belle, the illegitimate daughter of a plantation owner.<br /> The owner rescues Lavinia as a child of 7 after her parents died on a ship migrating from the Great Famine, and brings her home as in indentured servant.  The man's house slaves grow to love her, including his daughter, Belle, who acts as Lavinia's mother.<br /> The story travels through Lavinia's childhood; the slaves have come to love her, the family of the landowner, and into her marriage to the son of the landowner.<br /><br />Marshall, the son, appears to be a decent man, but in reality is a brutal, dissolute spendthrift, taking slaves as his mistresses. The author creates this credible world in the late 1700's and early 1800's with its drama.  The two narrators change throughout the years, and offer different looks at the society of the time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun. I love it because  its very addictive. I can not stop playing. I will never uninstall it. My rating is 4 star.
B00499NHLC|5.0|We like this show very much. Very well written and acted. We recommend it to our friends all the time.
B00AQ4U6P4|2.0|This was so predictable and one of the more terrible films i've seen in recent years.<br />My husband and I couldn't stop cracking jokes and laughing throughout the movie, which I doubt was the intention of the director/producer.<br />The only reason I gave it 2 stars is 1) because J. Lawrence is a good actress (even in this disappointing thriller, but even she couldn't save it) and 2) I didn't turn it off and sat through the whole thing...albeit giggling throughout.<br /><br />Probably not worth your time. But bad thrillers are a niche for some people, so this would probably fit in well. Teenagers might also find it OK at, like, a girl sleepover or something.<br />JMHO.<br /><br />Anna
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best thing I have seen in a long time and it is so .such better than  Temple run and it is way better than any other game have played it is so<br /> Good It is almost adicting
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Used this on my JA Henckels average kitchen knives and got them twice as sharp as the diamond sharpener my wife bought. Is it as good as the three stone method? No. But will get them plenty sharp enough to cut through a tomatoe like a warm knife thru butter, yes.<br />Plus you don't need to be an expert on the three stone with holding the knife at the correct angle.<br />Use smooth even strokes straight through and hold the knife straight, as easy as that.<br />Also won't leave scrapes along the upper part of the knife.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've been using this app for a few years.  Looks and feels just like a kindle.  The only &#34;drawback&#34; is that it isn't a kindle with super-long battery life and easy reading outdoors, but I use my android for more than just reading.  Someday, someone will make a device with two screens - one for reading (E-ink or equivalent) and one for &#34;computing&#34;.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Wish slide off page automatically came on so you do not have to search for power button while waking up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's easy and fun fab and awsome<br />It makes my whole family want to play every day<br />It also makes me want to get on my tablet
B00005MP58|4.0|Got this for a friend as a last minute Christmas gift.  Pleased that it got here so soon and so affordable.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A candid look at the life of an exceptional American.  Don't look for deep philosophical insights; Chris Kyle was a warrior, not a thinker.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Characters interesting. Murder scenes VERY GRAPHIC. Travolta character slimy but entertaining. Selma Hayak flawless as always. Had a Tarrantino kind of feel to it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Having read the other reviews, I have little more to add.  I find it to be very useful to let me know the status of the battery.  There is no guesswork or doubt.  When I use my Kindle 4G without a power connection, I am comfortable knowing how long I can go on using it without an abrupt cut-off.  For a freebie, this app is a great value.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this book as much as I enjoyed the first one Fall of Giants. Looking forward to the third one.
