B000002WUD|5.0|If you already own the 50's and 60's box sets, naturally this one is a must-have. There are many great tracks, especially those recorded in the early 70's before Elvis got tired of recording albums and started to lose some of the passion in his voice. I had always heard people bad-mouth Elvis's 70's music, but after hearing this collection for the first time I couldn't understand why. Maybe those were the people who only heard the hits. But even the hits like &quot;Burning Love&quot;, &quot;Always on my Mind&quot;, &quot;I've Lost You&quot;, and &quot;Promised Land&quot; were great. There are several B-sides that should've been singles like &quot;Stranger in the Crowd&quot;, &quot;You Asked Me To&quot; and &quot;Mary in the Morning&quot;. I could've done without the live tracks on disc number five. Live recordings always seem like filler to me. Instead of calling them &quot;live&quot; songs, they should call them &quot;songs that you've already heard but less polished and with people screaming in the background&quot;. No thanks. Elvis was supposedly bored with the music business during these last years of his life and the live tracks support that belief. Oh well, there are still tons of great songs here. But this collection is not as complete as the 50's and 60's sets. There are many songs that didn't make it like &quot;Three Corn Patches&quot;, &quot;Never Again&quot;, &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, and tons more that would have been nice to hear instead of the live stuff. As much as I love this set, I can't help but feel sad thinking about &quot;what might have been&quot;. There could've and should've been an 80's and 90's box set. There is no doubt in my mind Elvis would have continued his popularity all these years like Frank Sinatra did. What a shame. This set has a great booklet as well. Beware of other Box Sets other than the &quot;Essential 50's, 60's and 70's&quot;. These are the best for your money. The other sets include many &quot;alternate takes&quot;. There's a reason why those &quot;alternate takes&quot; were never released. Think about it. To summarize, this collection could have been better, but not by much.
0345413377|4.0|I don't think you even read the book because it hardly mentions Satan and doesn't give so much as a personality to God. Yes, God is there. But not completely and it never says that He hates sex or that Satan provides knowledge. What this book is about is a girl named Lyra and a boy named Will who put their goal in front of themselves right until the end of the book. In the beginning of the trilogy, Lyra tries to help save these children who were kidnapped by people called &quot;Gobblers&quot; and taken to the north to perform experiments on, concerning their souls, called daemons. These daemons, in their world, can change into any animal form until they reach puberty when they settled into permanant shapes, reflecting their partners' personalities. Lyra receives a golden compass that can tell her the truth about everything she askes of it through pictures. In the second book, she meets a boy named Will who becomes the owner of a knife called the subtle knife that can cut through anything-even the material between worlds. In the third book, they learn more about their souls, daemons, the world of which the dead are kept, and God Himself. They learn the truth of temptation and why they have to stay in their own worlds in order to rebuild Heaven. Not a kingdom of Heaven, but a Republic. So as you can see, this book and the series it belongs in has nothing to do with Satan. If you don't believe, go read the books yourself. And actually READ THEM before forming conclusions about them. Lies are not appreciated by true readers. Neither is ignorance. If you have legitimate reasons for disliking the book, I would be happy to hear them.
B00005QJDG|5.0|I bought Scenes from New York three days after it came out, and I must say that the original cover is much better.  I know it offended some people (some of my friends included), but if you look into why DT uses that imagery, it's actually very fitting.<BR>   <BR>On to the album itself.  I don't want to gush about the music; we all know that it's excellent.  And Dream Theater remains one of the best live bands around.  This is a better live offering than Livetime, though, mostly because it isn't so full of songs from Falling into Infinity (Livetime had been recorded on that tour.)  Also, Labrie seems to have ironed out his tone at extreme pitches.  It is easy to make out the words to every song, unlike before.  Jordan Rudess is much, much better than Sherinian (listen to the solo at the end of Disc 2, and compare it to Sherinian's on Livetime.)  The guest performers also really add quality.  <BR>  <BR>Basically, everything about this album is good, even the [amount] that I paid for it.  Put simply, you should buy it.
0345413377|5.0|First off, this book is NOT, for the last time, anything about SATAN and God isn't given so much as a personality. God is there, all right, and he does die, but that doesn't mean that the author suports Satan. He simply supports being human, which to him, means not being ruled by some higher power in the Heavens, but by being a republic. To him, Heaven is not supposed to be a kingdom in the clouds somewhere, but on Earth where people take care of themselves. However, we seem to be horrible at doing that with all that's happened. Nevertheless, you should not completely trash this book just because God dies. There is so much more in the book than just that. What Philip Pullman is focusing on isn't really God but something better. His message is to not wait to go to Heaven to have a better life. You should take control of yourself and try to have a better life on your own! His idea of Heaven is a place where everyone is in control of himself/herself, doing good things on their own. In our world, though, things are much more complicated than that and at times I do wish that Philip Pullman would realize that. But this was a series that became his own idea of what the world ought to be. That's what some writers do, answering their own questions of life and death. It's whether people agree with them that's the problem. But I'm not going to argue anymore. I've ranted enough and I've defended the book enough. Judge it however you like. It just annoys me very much to see all these people saying that the book is bad because they think that Philip Pullman supports the Devil. Well, people, get better educated. All People who don't believe in God don't all believe in the Devil. Some do, but there are other religions out there! Philip Pullman is what is called an athiest. He doesn't believe in God or the Devil. So he wrote a book saying that we don't need God to live and we don't need Heaven and Hell to keep us from doing bad things. Due to this, I can understand how people can beoffended. Some people aren't. They understand the message and accept it. I understand it, though I don't necessarily accept it. It's a new point of view and it doesn't deserve to be stampeded across on. END
B00000I14Z|5.0|i admit it...charles mingus has always intimidated me...i have other music by him, a live disc that even his die-hard fans have criticized and a compilation of blues and ballads that i only enjoy in spurts...<BR>...nothing that i have bragged about to others...just kinda ho-hum...<BR>but mingus has always remained one of those musicians that i have felt compelled to dig into to find out what all of the fuss was about...i'm glad i kept diggin and didnt stop with those other recordings  because this is some truly enjoyable music being played here!  for those of yall with similar encounters with mingus as i, or if you are just looking for that first album of his for you to get into, then let me recommend this one for you; you'll either be satisfied and stop with this purchase or very pleased and urged (as i) to dig deeper into his other classics...
B00000DFSK|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite compilation albums ever!  You can't go wrong with all of U2's best songs on one album.  I like the fact that they used the single mix of Sweetest Thing because it's a lot better than the other version.  This album also gives you an idea of the evolution of the group over a span of ten years.  From rock sounds of Pride and Sunday Bloody Sunday, To the balads of With or without you and All I want is you, this album covers a lot of ground.  I also liked the Jazz-Rock hybrid, When love comes to town.
B00005A0RI|5.0|...lush and low, this music sweeps you offa your feet and lays you sof'ly back down...deeply romantic and ideal for those &quot;personal encounters&quot; us grown folks love, but perfect just to sit back by yourself and wallow in...very pleasurable...if you are reading this, then you are already interested to begin with so dont short yourself, get this now!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|With the release of &quot;Snow White&quot; Disney has effectively raised the bar from which all DVDs should be judged. Personally, I spent four evenings sifting through all the extra features included in this hefty two-disc set. In a nutshell, &quot;Snow White&quot;, is loaded. Of course the film itself, Hollywood's first full-length animated feature, was truly groundbreaking when released in 1937. Created in a cloud of doubt, very few believed that Walt Disney could entertain an audience with an 84-minute &quot;cartoon&quot;.(See &quot;The Making of Snow White&quot; on Disc One) However, all naysayers grossly underestimated Mr. Disney's astute ability to weave a great story, memorable characters and classic songs into a visually stunning package. Disney practically begged for financial assistance to keep the project afloat and when it finally premiered in December 1937, &quot;Snow White&quot; defied all doubters to become the highest grossing film of its time. &quot;Snow White&quot; set the standard for all animation which followed and, remarkably, through the process of digital restoration, the film looks as though it could have been released just yesterday. The colors are intensely vivid and the clarity is unsurpassed. According to technicians who participated in the restoration, (see &quot;Restoration&quot; on Disc Two), the visual quality of &quot;Snow White&quot; on DVD is equal to that of the original animation cells. In other words, we are finally seeing this classic in its purest form. <br />Merely owning a pristine copy of this all-time classic would be good enough for most. However &quot;Snow White&quot;, like the &quot;Matrix&quot;, The James Bond films and a handful of other loaded DVDs, raises the standards of home video. In a perfect world, all DVDs would feature the endless array of bonus features contained within &quot;Snow White&quot;. For those who are interested, below is a list of just a FEW of the extras:<br />1)A compelling full-length audio commentary provided by Walt Disney himself (compiled from various interviews). For film buffs, Mr. Disney's insightful commentary may well be the most invaluable feature of the entire DVD. <br />2)A 39-minute &quot;Making of..&quot; documentary.<br />3) 40+ minutes of &quot;Disney through the Decades&quot; and short features such as &quot;How Disney Cartoons are Made&quot;, &quot;A Trip Through Disney Studios&quot; and &quot;The Restoration&quot;. <br />4)Six deleted scenes. <br />5)Trailers for each of &quot;Snow White's&quot; eight re-releases  <br />6)Various stills and storyboard sketches. <br />If all this is too exhausting, and believe me there's a lot more, host Angela Lansbury will take you on a 20-minute &quot;Guided Tour&quot; which neatly highlights the best of the bonus features. Overall, a classic DVD treatment for a classic movie. &quot;Snow White&quot; has withstood the test of time and will, undoubtedly, continue to entertain audiences for generations on end. This is truly a &quot;must own&quot; DVD.
B000024D4R|5.0|I think that only the Wall(another almost only Waters creation) would have done better than this album,surely not Wish you were here, that,bar for the title track,after a while may even be boring! <BR>Here the songs are surely long,but after having  finished listen to them I'd repeat the whole musical trip whithout any problem, being  it so true and meaningful..yes,the Orwellian vision of mankind makes even the casual listener think about his condition,and the fact that at the same time you can enjoy great rocks melodies only add pleasure to reflection,the perfect pair,I think.<BR>Wish you were here was about Syd,this album is about us (whatever may be your interpretation of the words)and is the real prologue to The Wall.
0385486804|5.0|The first time i read this book I was a traveling on a train, from Colorado to California.  I didn't put the book down once and was finished before the Sierras were in sight.  It provides insight in a young man's life, and his tragic death, and everything that inspired him in between.  It's not a happy tale, nor a sad one.  It makes you want to be great, and rarely in this day and age do we have the opportunity to think about, let alone accomplish, greatness.  What else could you possibly want from a book?
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Hollywood-listen up. &quot;Memento&quot; has shown you how to get great acting, a one of a kind plot with a surprise twist-a surprise beginning, and a surprise end, great directing, one of the best screenplays ever written, and purely ingenious story-telling and then combine it to make one of the freshest and most compelling who-done-its I've seen in a long time. It doesn't hurt that Chris Nolan had one of the greatest casts put together either. Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss are easy on the eyes too which didn't hurt. Joe Pantoliano provided just the right touch to <BR>help bring out some of the more humorous moments, and there are plenty even though the subject is serious.  Not a movie I'll soon forget.
B00003A9QL|3.0|Censorship totally ruined this album for me. I bought this thinking it was an uncensored version but to my surprise it was ruined with interuptions of songs. The bleeps and maskings in the songs broke the feel of what Metallica really is. The hard core, blasting, sometimes angry, roar of the public eye (that some people are afraid to express) is what Metallica is all about. If that means having to hear a few bad words, oh well, let me hear it...and hear it loud! If you don't like it don't buy it. (thats why there are explicite word warnings on almost every album you buy anymore) I would advise if you want to hear freedom of expression, buy the uncensored version. If you are a whining liberal, and want to hear crap, buy this one.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|This album forms , along with &quot;Dire Straits&quot; ( their very first ) and &quot;Communiqu&eacute;&quot; , the trilogy that defines the first stage of Dire Straits ' music : songs almost exclusively built around the &quot;London blues&quot; state of mind that Mark Knopfler and Co. captured , developed and expressed with such artistry and mastery.<br />Knopfler's Dylan-esque voice , his unique guitar sound , or , better said , the guitar-voice tandem , so magnificently coupled together that one is part of the other , defined this early period . The three albums mentioned above were characterized also by the fact that one song in each stands clearly above the rest , which doesn't mean that the other songs were not good . Far from that , but there was ONE special song , one that would become a classic , one you couldn't forget after the very first listening.<br />In the first album , that song was , obviously , &quot;Sultans of swing&quot; ; in the second album it was &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot; ; and for the third album , Making Movies , Knopfler gives us the magnificent ( to me the best of all three ) &quot; Tunnel of love &quot; .<br />As &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; and &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot; , &quot;Tunnel of love&quot; is a true tour-de-force , a vertiginous ride through different states of mind , emotions and feelings , alternating quick passages with slow , paused ones , and heading towards an exhilarating and frantic end . This is the kind of composition in which Knopfler feels like a fish in water : alternating the blues of love-lost times with the sudden happiness of new emotions and the discovery of love , &quot;Tunnel of love&quot; delivers it all . Plus his guitar paints some of the most beautiful notes and chords ever composed or played for and by this instrument . Guitar playing doesn't get as powerful as this too often .<br />The rest of the songs can't match the brilliance of &quot;Tunnel&quot; ( as a matter of fact , I've always thought that &quot;Tunnel&quot; should have been the closing song , not the opener , because once you hear it , it's really tough to go back to that peak ) , but nevertheless there are good songs , particularly &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Expresso love&quot; which became classics in their own right .<br />Again , this was the last &quot;early-Straits&quot; album , after this came &quot;Love over gold&quot; with a bolder , more-urgent sound , a transition between the first era of the band and their greatest work &quot;Brothers in arms&quot; . The last album of that initial era , &quot;Making Movies&quot; is probably the best of all three and deserves a place of honor in the history of the Dire Straits .&quot;Tunnel&quot; should have been the closing song , not the opener , because once you hear it , it´s really tough to go back to that peak ) , but nevertheless there are good songs , particularly &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Expresso love&quot; which became classics in their own right .<br />Again , this was the last &quot;early-Straits&quot; album , after this came &quot;Love over gold&quot; with a bolder , more-urgent sound , a transition between the first era of the band and their greatest work &quot;Brothers in arms&quot; .

B00005BJ2O|2.0|This album has ONE good song on it. The cover of Lady Marmalade is the only decent song. The rest are utterly unbearable. They are sang by actors. Why? Actors are actors for a reason. They are good at playing a part, not singing. Most of the songs sounded like you were in an opera somewhere. That just isn't me. If you like that sort of music, you may want to buy this. Otherwise don't waste the money. Just go out and try to find a single of Lady Marmalade.
B0000027F8|5.0|I seldom listen to pop, but this album grabbed me rightaway. For a start, this man can really SING. No off-key whining from him, no need for special effects to enhance a puny voice. Michael has plenty of power, great breath control and a sense of phrasing that is all his own. Listen Without Prejudice is virtuoso stuff.<br />The album is plainly Michael's cri de coeur. Take me seriously, he is saying. And we do. From start to finish, his combination of plaintive, heart-felt vocals and simple but hard-hitting lyrics are a joy, and this is an album that just gets better and better with repeated listenings.<br />Autobiography seems to run a strong theme throughout several of the songs, notably Something To Save, Waiting For That Day and the reprise that concludes the album. Michael is in pain, and he doesn't care who knows it. I've heard Michael's voice described as &quot;plain&quot; but there is nothing ordinary about these haunting performances.<br />Equally good is the moving Mother's Pride, an angry but sweetly sung condemnation of war. The song changes key two thirds of the way through, grabbing the heartstrings along the way.<br />A must-have for anyone who admires pop singing with a soul.
0316776963|2.0|Maybe it's just because I think too much like David Sedaris, but I didn't find his stories humorous.  I saw the punchlines coming.  <br />It could be my internal tendencies towards homosexuality which I vehemently deny, especially to my girlfriend.  It could be that I'm a southern libertarian yearning for the simpler days like those found in &quot;Run with the Horseman&quot; which had me rolling (and alternately crying), though I'm not political.  <br />If you want twists, read some of Roald Dahl's short stories.  If you want funny morals, read Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, or even better the Memoirs of Casanova).  If you want contemporary intellectual humor, read David Foster Wallace (I haven't finished Infinite Jest because I have yet to find it minimally giggly (too tongue in cheek, ala Catch-22) but it is intellectual and it's supposed to be funny.<br />Sure, I chuckled a few times here and there but nothing caused me to lose my composure and laugh loud enough to embarass myself in public.  The text was too big, the book was too short, and the writing too simple.  If you are determined to read this, save your cash and check it out of the library.
0064407667|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Not only is the plot dull and uninspired, but the writing is horrible. One of the most annoying aspects is the authors irritating way of taking time out of the story to define words! An example would be &quot;in a rickety cart - rickety here meaning...&quot;  I prefer when writers allow me to decide which words I know or don't know and decide when to use a dictionary.<br />I like the idea of a &quot;gothic&quot; children's series with dark and dangerous mysteries, but this is certainly not it. Save your money. This book is terrible.
1573226521|5.0|What an exciting surprise to find such brilliance, in a book that was made into a sub par movie staring Leonardo `De Cappuccino'.  It's about a backpacker who finds a map leading to a closed off island in Thailand, which he finds a commune of other packers living in &quot;paradise&quot;.  Nintendo, smoking pot, war in the woods--the book does a lot to capture an era.  It's a great piece of fiction, which I can't for the life of me figure out some of the bad ratings here--possibly lacking a sense of imagination and wonder?  If you ever used to play war, then this is a must read.
0316286850|5.0|I have always admired and loved Kevin Aucoin's magic with makeup. Which is exactly what it is.  Being from around the same area as him, kinda gives a sense of hope that when I go to pursue my career in makeup, that I will be able to succeed also.  And who better to teach me, or anyone for that matter.  I have his other book also, Face Forward, and they both amaze me.  This book is the ultimate best! You can't go wrong
0872860175|5.0|Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of self-appointed critics who, in order to try to convince others of their own individuality and intellectual honesty, feel the need to let everyone know that they consider Ginsberg (and every other so-called &quot;Beat&quot; for that matter) to be an overrated hack and more of a celebrity than a poet and blah, blah, blah, blah.  It is true that Ginsberg's style has been imitated by far too many lesser poets who, obviously, don't posess anything close to the man's talent and it is also true that there's an equal number of people who claim to love Ginsberg but have never actually bothered to sit down and really read anything beyond the first page of &quot;Howl.&quot;  Inetivably, one wishes that all of these presumed literary critics (regardless of where they stand) would just shut up, read the poems for themselves, and form their own opinions regardless of what the current trend is.  For if they did, they would discover a very talented poet who, even if he occasionally seemed to be repeating and parodying himself as he got older, still created some of the strongest American poetry of the latter 20th Century.  While Kaddish remains his strongest work of poetry, his much more famous poem &quot;Howl&quot; still carries more of a raw, exhilirating anger.  Written to be read aloud, Howl is basically a cry against the conformity of 1950s America but the anger found within still reverberates almost half a century later.  Certainly, his vision of a drug-abusing community of outcasts wandering along darkened city streets remains as relavent as ever.  Like any apocalyptic poem, it can be credibly charges that at times, Howl is superficial and there's not much beyond shocking images.  I don't necessarily disagree with this -- Howl, for instance, doesn't carry the same emotional weight as Ginsberg's more personal Kaddish.  However, if Howl is all image, they're still very powerful images.  Would I feel the same passion for this poem if I didn't know the much-reported stories of Ginsberg's &quot;best minds of my generation destroyed by madness?&quot;  In short, if the beats hadn't been so celebrated by the media, would this poem have the same power?  Honestly, who cares?  The fact of the matter is that yes, the beats were celebrated (or hyped depending on your point of view) by the media and Howl is a powerful poem.  All other considerations are simply unimportant doublespeak.  As for the other poems contained with Howl, they are a mixed batch but all have their value.  Some are a little too obviously based on Whitman (much as countless other poets based too much on Ginsberg) but they all have their points of interest.  Its obvious that none of them were chosen to overshadow Howl but to a certain extent, that works very well.  After the rage and madness of Howl, its good to have these other poems to &quot;come down&quot; with.<br />With all this talk of anger and rage, I should also mention that Ginsberg's sense of joy is a component of his poetry that too many critics either fail to mention or ignore all together.  Whatever you may think of his talent, it is obvious that Ginsberg loved poetry and found his greatest happiness through the discovery of new forms of poetic expressions.  For all of its apocalyptic ragings, Howl never grows shrill because one can sense the fact that Ginsberg had a lot of fun composing (and performing) the poem.  A few years before his own death, I was lucky enough to attend one of Allen Ginsberg's readings.  Though he read mostly from Kaddish and his shorter poems (perhaps, understandably, trying to make sure we understood he actually had written other poems beyond the one everyone kept citing), he also read a bit from Howl.  He proved to be an amazing reader, going over these words he must have seen over a million times past, with an almost childlike enthusiasm and joy.  As he did this, I looked out at the others in the audience and basically, I saw rows and rows of identical looking &quot;intellectuals,&quot; all posessing the same dead-serious expression on their face, nodding at each relavent point as if to make sure everyone understood that they understood genius.  Contrasting their forced seriousness with Ginsberg's uninhibited joy, I realized that there was only one true tragesy as far as Allen Ginsberg was concerned and that was the fact that his self-appointed acolytes always took him for more seriously then he did himself.  To consider Howl and Ginsberg without joy is like considering language without words.
B0000013GT|5.0|OutKast proved that not only are they two of the best damn rappers ever but they can also lay down some f----in great beats and sound.  It's hard to believe it but this album has their first productions and they sound great.  This albums is full of great songs like &quot;ATLiens&quot; and &quot;Two Dope Boyz&quot; not to mention &quot;Elavators&quot; which is one of the best rap songs ever.  HIGHly recommended.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I have loved Luke SKywalker since I was 11 years old, and I can say that this movie will never hold a place in my heart the way the original trilogy did.  It seemed to me that George Lucas was trying to recreate his trilogy, and failing.  However, there are some strong points: Ewan and Liam were wonderful, Darth Maul was a highly effective baddie, and Natalie Portman wasn't nearly as annoying as I thought she would be.  Of course, there are some bad points as well: Jar Jar, Anakin, etc.  I wouldn't recommend getting the DVD unless you REALLY love the movie or just want the ability to get the the good parts faster (why do you think I'm actually buying this thing?)
B00001U0DP|2.0|It has taken me months to finally come to a decision on this movie.  There is a review on this page that says it best: &quot;If you know a lot about WW II and the Holocaust, then the movie is hard to watch and it's hard to accept that its humor fits. But if you are new to the subject or feel rather emotionally distant from it, perhaps you can enjoy the movie as a moving inspirational story. Perhaps.&quot;  I found this movie's lighthearted, sanitary, and comic portrayal of the Holocaust under a wall of sentimentality extremely hard to accept.  Yet, at the same time, each and every person who I know who has seen it and who is not as familiar with the Holocaust and WWII as I, has found it to be a tragic story.  For those familiar with the time period, you know that &quot;tragic&quot; is a tame and happy word when used next to &quot;holocaust&quot;.  There simply are no words to adequately describe the depths of that time.  I have to conclude beyond doubt that the fact that it has won so much acclaim attests to the fact that the perspective of the Holocaust has begun to fade irretrievably from memory.  This is most distressing.  <BR>But I must say, Robert B. is great in the first half where he meets courts his wife.  And also, I confess, the scene where he's translating for the German Guard in the camp...I found myself laughing despite myself.  I love Robert B.'s humor.  Still, please be careful to understand history before letting this movie to close to you.  It is as real as a pink plastic Easter egg.
B000002504|5.0|Gentle Giant's music is, as they rightly say, an acquired taste. This gave the band a strong core of dedicated fans, but ultimately drove Gentle Giant out of existence. I have always wondered what they were thinking; you can't produce this kind of complex educated music and get any kind of commercial sucess. More accessible than Curved Air or Henry Cow, less grandiose or cosmic than Yes, Gentle Giant created a sound that no one could imitate or degrade with the exception of themselves.<br />Octopus is the first part of the three album high point of their spiky career, culminating in Free Hand, and then fulminating on Interview, etc. The tightness of the playing, the cohesion of the vision was never better here. The songs are projections of the players: smart, sharp, and concise. The world of 1973, even with its lack of technology, internet, and globalisation, produced so much good music based on the what the musicians themselves could do, not on drum loops, samples, and sequencers, that it makes me timesick to think about it. Here is an exellent example of has been lost.<br />Why this is not using the original Roger Dean cover is a mystery. American Prog covers are boring compared to the English artists on the late '60's and 70's.

B000002OX7|5.0|Pete Townshend began his best period of song writing at the same time he had his first nervous breakdown. The material for the proposed multi-media event &quot;Lifehouse&quot; came to light on 'Who's Next,' after Townshend could not bring &quot;Lifehouse&quot; to fruition. 'Who's Next' contains some of the best rock songs ever written, some of the best playing, and some of the best use of early sythesizer technology. Townshend made the leap that evaded other artists at the time. He spoke for active engagement in the world, and active engagement with not only technology, but with established song forms.<br />&quot;Baba O'Riley,&quot; is one of the greatest rock songs not only for its rich orchestration, anthemic words, and drive, but for Townshend's blending of power chords, Moon's intense drumming, Entwhistle's melodic bass, and Daltrey's power singing over synthesized textures derived not from any previous musical form, but from his own vital statistics. The ending of the song, parlaying Dave Arbus's folkish fiddling over the sythesized texture described the battle between technology and people. In a thematic unity strong than on many so-called concept albums, Townshend explores this battle to the bitter end.<br />Musically powerful, &quot;Who Next&quot; set the standard for rock in the 70's, most of which was a parody of Townshend's intelligence, conflict, and wellspring of creative rage.
0312263120|1.0|In the hands of a good screenwriter given a mandate to make big changes, this book could make a good movie, but as literature, it's painful. The main characters are one-dimensional stereotypes (unless they are hiding something, in which case they are two-dimensional at best), the writing is clichd, and the ending was the most excrutiating, drawn-out thing I've ever experienced in a climactic scene. (Okay, when you know the answer to a riddle on which the entire future of civilization hangs for a few moments before the supposedly brilliant main characters figure it out, that's not ideal but it sometimes happens in fiction; when you know the answer pages and pages and pages ahead of them, and are tortured as they take baby-steps toward the answers, it makes you want to throw the book across the room.) While the way all the characters were described and portrayed bugged me, none bothered me as much as the main character, Susan. We're told she's incredibly brilliant, but more space is given over to descriptions of her incredible legs than her brains, and she's usually shown acting clueless, worried, or insecure. It's really too bad, because the plot was promising, but the execution fell too far short to recommend the book.
B000002J1O|5.0|In late 1973 the post-Beatles British Rock movement came to its climax. Among the albums recorded and released at this time are ELP's &quot;Brain Salad Surgery,&quot; King Crimson's &quot;Lark's Tongues in Aspic,&quot; and the greatest of them all, Genesis' &quot;Selling England By the Pound.&quot; Where other post-Beatle bands chose to soar into the journey of the soul, or to explore apocalyptic anti-technology themes, Genesis stayed here on Earth, specifically Southeastern England, to record the collapse of the British nation into political, economic, social, and cultural nothingness. The songs on &quot;Selling England&quot; reflect the destruction of folklore, of history, of social meaning in post-War life. Tapping on literary sources from early English poetry, Edmund Spenser's equally lyrical &quot;The Faerie Queen&quot; (1590) to T.S. Eliot's equally bleak write-off of Industrial/Captialist Culture &quot;The Waste Land(1922), Genesis created a vision of Shakespeare's &quot;Scepter'd Isle&quot; (Richard II) transmogrifying into a corporate &quot;Aisle of Plenty.&quot;<br />Muscially brilliant, moving from A-cappella cris de coeur to searing guitar solos, flowing keyboard lines to inventive bass and drum work, Genesis never bore, even in the long instrumentals that give weight to &quot;Selling England.&quot; A cohesive work far surpassing other post-Beatle concept albums (including their own misguided &quot;Lamb&quot; disaster), the classical and European avant-garde influences blend seamlessly with Genesis's own visions to create something wholly new, wholly Western, and wholly post-modern.<br />A work of sorrow, rage, and shock, in its way, Selling England By the Pound&quot; is the upper-class equivalent of &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks,&quot; and far more genuine. Gabriel, Banks, and Rutherford were all well-educated members of the Upper Class, trained at Charterhouse, Collins was a child-stage star, while Hackett was one of the many middle-class kids seduced by rock and roll.<br />The 1973 oil-shock and subsequent world depression destroyed post-Beatles rock, and after &quot;Lamb&quot; Genesis dumbed itself down to the point of non-existence.<br />As a sharp rendering of that brink moment when all of Western Civilization came crashing down into a post-modern late-capitalist heap where no artistic statement is important, and where the commodity of humanity is worth less than the money humans might have to spend, &quot;Selling England by the Pound,&quot; like all great works of art, borders on prophecy.d by rock and roll. <br />The 1973 oil-shock and subsequent world depression destroyed post-Beatles rock, and after &quot;Lamb&quot; Genesis dumbed itself down to the point of non-existence. <br />As a sharp rendering of that brink moment when all of Western Civilization came crashing down into a post-modern late-capitalist heap where no artistic statement is important, and where the commodity of humanity is worth less than the money humans might have to spend, &quot;Selling England by the Pound,&quot; like all great works of art, borders on prophecy.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Well, I've read and heard all the &quot;Lucas bashing&quot; ever since Episode I was released in 1999, and I think it's really a childish waste.  Sure, Jar-Jar was annoying to some, but I liked him.  He provides the &quot;comic relief&quot; that the two droids had in the original trilogy.  I think Jake Lloyd did a great job, and didn't put in a &quot;cardboard&quot; performance like he's been accused of doing.  My God, the kid is only 8 years-old, give him a break!<BR>I loved the lightsaber battles, space battles, the visual effects, and performances. Sure, Darth Maul was drastically underused.  Maybe we'll see more of his race in Episode II or III. After seeing it now on DVD, the perfect format for my FAVORITE series of movies, you get to see it the way Lucas meant it to be enjoyed.  After watching all of the extras and &quot;making of&quot; specials, you see how hard everyone worked for almost five years to make this movie.  I guess my only regret about the DVD is why not just include all 7 of the deleted scenes into the movie itself.  The only one included is the brief &quot;Coruscant Taxi&quot; scene.  That's it.  But then Lucas explains that including them into the movie would have slowed it down, etc.  Now, with Episode II coming next summer, and Episode III in 2005, I'm as pumped about Star Wars as I was when I saw the first one when I was 7 years-old in 1977.  These movies have made a deep impression upon me, and my life.  So, I guess from what I hear from Lucas that all six Star Wars films will be on DVD after Episode III in 2005.  That's fine.  This is his life's work, and I'm proud to be a Star Wars FANATIC! I can wait for them.  Maybe not patiently...but I'll wait knowing they're on the way to DVD!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|By &quot;casual fan,&quot; I mean someone who hasn't seen every DIsney movie ever made, who doesn't watch The Disney Channel religiously, and who hasn't even seen a lot of the classic Disney features. Someone like me. I've seen plenty of Disney movies, but there are also plenty I haven't seen. In fact, when I watched this DVD last week, it was the first time I'd seen &quot;Snow White&quot; since I was about 5. Needless to say, there was much of the film I didn't remember, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was like seeing the film again for the first time, and I was not disappointed. The restoration is magnificent, and one of the very finest I've seen. As for the extra features, they were quite well done. There's about three pages up above listing them in detail, so I don't need to elaborate on that point. The old girl has aged well! I just hope I'm looking this good when I'm 64!
B0000069NM|5.0|I really have a good handle on this disc.  First of all, the disc would be better if this were  Medeski, Martin, & Wood backed up by John Scofield.  Scofield is an aquired taste.  His tone is grating.  His playing is halting; little phrases.  He is abstract; you can't get a hold on him.  You don't know where he starts or ends.  He plays too much on this disc.  He is annoying.  MMW is unbelievable.  Inventive; deep grooves; Hip-Hop, Rock, Free Jazz, Pop: really the new generation of what's happening now.  Ultra hip Acid Jazz.  Deep Grooves.  The absolute best.  Why are they backing Scofield up.  If the disc had them out in front, It would be great, really great.  The question really is WHY ARE THEY PLAYING THIS FUNK STUFF?  Who is listening to this anymore.  Otis Redding is dead.  Boogaloo is dead.  Some of this is idiotic.  It's 2001.  This is Atlantic Records 1965.  Funky Broadway.  Arthur Conley.  Why does Scofield play this stuff.  MMW is held back the whole disc.  Playing Funk behind Scofield.  The best tracks are the ones where MMW are allowed to stretch out and play.  \\"Chank\\", \\"Green Tea\\", \\"Hottentot\\", and \\"Chicken Dog\\", are the best tracks, cause I'm hearing that incredible Hammond B-3 ( I love the B-3), that inventive drumming, and that deep deep bass.  MMW discs are so in, this stuff is so out.  I would never drag this out and tell someone \\"you've got to hear this\\".  This disc could have been the best of all time with this lineup.  Why did I give it 5 stars?  There are people who can deal with the abstract playing of John Scofield.  There are people who like this type of stuff.  I just adore MMW.  If you are a person who likes any one of these three things, buy this disc, you will love the playing.  MMW is no one's backup band.  WHY DO JAZZ PEOPLE PLAY THIS TYPE OF MUSIC.  IT IS SO OUT.  JAZZ IS SUPPOSED TO BE HIP.  AUGHHHH!
B00003CXCT|3.0|I have to say I am not a big Star Wars fan,but if YOU are then this DVD will not disappoint.Like all in the Star Wars series it has plenty of content and the sound is superb.A home theater system will be well used with any Star Wars episode and this one is no eception.CGI is great and again if you are a fan you must add this to your collection.If you have never seen Star Wars then I would check out Amazon's available discs and start from the begining.If you like,then you have a wealth of material for your viewing pleasure.In all the episodes I have seen the acting was very good and there are always some big stars in them.IMO the early ones with Harridon Ford are a must. So why not buy and see what the fuss is about.If you're a fan then go for it!
B00003XACV|4.0|If I had been told before I saw American Beauty that a composer wold have the audacity to write an almost all percussion score and, moreover, MAKE IT WORK, I'd have thought the idea crazy.  But Newman did, and he did it by creating a style even more unorthodox then his usual film scores.<br />American Beauty's Main Theme is essentially three chords, played on the marimba repeatedly. This sounds boring and far from inventive, but the fact that the listener keeps coming back for more really shows Newman's Talent.  Every track holds a new listening experience, all utilizing percussion--generally either marimba or piano--and all so inspired and fun that one is undoubtedly attracted to this score.<br />While, as usual, Newman's lighter themes bear more than a small resemblence to some of his prior works, they remain fresh, appropriate, and always appealing.  The more upbeat and lively themes provide the majority of the album and easily represent the CD's high point.  Every track goes down a new path with a new theme, and everyone brings the listener into a new region of the human mind.<br />This CD is well worth the price--perhaps MORE--and for any of Newman's more &quot;new age&quot; admirers, this album is a must-have, embodying his greatest effort in this style.  I fail to give it a 5th star only by the fact that Newman also wrote Meet Joe Black, which stands out as my favorite composition of his, though it retreates to more orthodox methods of composing.  Regardless, American Beauty will rest as a classic in American Cinema, and the fact that it lost out for Best Score at the Oscars should not deter anyone from purchasing this marvelous music.
B00005JKHP|3.0|This film has three things going for it.  In order of importance they are:<BR>* A genuinely great film score, not just the famous march that was later used as the _Next Generation_ theme, but also the suite of &quot;wonder of outer space&quot; music written to accompany the Enterprise's interminable journey inside V'ger.  The &quot;Klingon theme&quot; is another highlight, but there are many highlights in this score.  This is not only the best music ever written for a science fiction film, it's among the best film music ever written, way ahead of pastiche merchants like John Williams and up there with the likes of Vaughan Williams' music for _Scott of the Antarctic_ (revised as the _Antarctic Symphony_) and the best Prokoffiev scores;<BR>* Some great visuals: the scenes in which a camera pans along the Enterprise don't work so well, but the images created for the incredibly long exploration of V'ger's cloud and interior are often quite beautiful, considered as abstract art with a great soundtrack (in some ways they improve on the images for Kubrick's great space trip, but Kubrick came first; this film is all too clearly derivative of _2001_);    <BR>* Generally good acting (despite what people say!), with Shatner having the courage to portray his hero as badly flawed, even unpleasant, only recovering his balance again when he has his friends around him, and Stephen Collins making the best of a difficult role as the captain usurped by Kirk's rampaging Alpha Male.<br />The problem was that these elements are never allowed to gel into a good movie.  The somnolence of the pacing and the gigantism of the cloud/V'ger effects dwarfed the characters and ate away at the performances, so that the Enterprise crew were merely passive observers of the special effects, having far too little to do and say.  And the ideas behind the film simply aren't as interesting as the ideas in _2001: A Space Odyssey_, which is equally slow but always gripping.  <br />The other problem with this film is that Wise doesn't really understand the attractions of Star Trek.  What he seems to have done is try to make an ambitious, thumpingly sincere and worthy science fiction film, that happens to have the Star Trek cast along for the ride.  But Star Trek is first and foremost about its characters, of whom Kirk and Spock, at least, are epic figures (Kirk in particular has a lot in common with Odysseus), and the interrelationships between them.  Trek that doesn't focus on the people on the bridge is bad Trek.  <br />On the other hand the ideas aren't good enough (or original enough) for the film to be good cerebral science fiction in the mould of _2001_ or _Solaris_, which is what Wise seems to be shooting for.  <br />Another way for science fiction to be good is to be dumb-but-energetic, in the &quot;radiation made the bugs grow real big and hungry&quot; sub-genre, or perhaps the light-sword and sorcery sub-genre, but this film doesn't have the energy or humour for that.  Its ambition is commendable, but it failed to deliver, and Robert Wise's second thoughts come too late to change the film's fundamentals.  <br />Wise's director's cut has improved the film significantly from the original release version and from the longer video version.  The main changes are that the special effects are better integrated, serving the story line more than dominating or impeding it, and better use is made of the character scenes.  But the revision this film needs most should have been done 32 years ago, at the scripting stage; you can't save everything with a re-edit.   <br />I'm not writing the film off.  It has the merits mentioned above, some good ideas, and a few (but far too few) good Star Trek moments.  I've mentioned Kirk's character arc from an obsessive figure determined to get his ship back, regardless of the consequences, to re-gaining his balance, warmth and perspective, with a little help from his friends.  (But that arc was resolved too easily, in practice; specialeffects time could and should have sacrificed to make Kirk's recovery of himself more detailed and more dramatic.)  Spock's character arc, from a pursuit of total logic to acceptance of his emotions, is a late addition to the film, and that sometimes shows.  Still, though it's cornball (hey, it's Star Trek), it works well enough.  <br />I'd recommend _The Motionless Picture_ for three audiences: Trek fans, of course, science fiction fans prepared to note and forgive borrowings from too many other films, and to forgive the unrelenting slowness (the reward for patience is effects/images that do communicate some of the wonder of space travel), and film music fans, who are in for something seriously good.  <br />Casual visitors to Star Trek should be aware that this is very different from &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; and the subsequent films featuring the original crew. Liking those films is no guarantee that you'll like this one.  <br />Cheers! <br />Laon

B00003CXE6|3.0|I suppose my expectations of this movie were a bit too high. I expected a revival of the Roman Epic such as embodied by Quo Vadis and Spartacus. Unfortunately Gladiator does not quite reach that level. The plot is not strong enough and personnaly I found the use of computergravics to generate a crowd, or even a sky a bit annoying at times. This said, the movie fulfills it's most important task: It is entertaining. There is a lot of action, which looks good, (although again, the scene with the tigers features to much CGI at times) the acting is okay, with a splendid last performance by Oliver Reed and the costumes are a feast for the eyes. All in all, not bad, but a bit pretentious.

B00003CX5P|5.0|The bottom line here is that you should buy this DVD. First, the 2nd DVD is filled with excellent special features that exceed almost every DVD I own.  It is clear much care was given to put high quality featurettes in, not just to cram space-filling junk.<br />More importantly, however, is the movie itself (of course).  We don't buy DVDs just to watch special features.  The acting in this movie is generally good, especially Nathalie Portman as the Queen.  Liam Neeson and the Macgregor guy are believable.  We don't seem to get quite as close to the characters as we did in the other 3 movies, however.  Jake Lloyd is actually quite annoying, and I found the relationship between he and the Queen to be a little sickening (coming WAY too close to being budding love- geez, it's like a 21 yo with a 5 yo!!!!).  They probably had to set the stage for Anakin to produce Luke and Leia with someone, but they COULD have made the age difference a little better.  Jar Jar wasn't exactly a success, but I also don't think he was the miserable failure Star Wars fans think he was.<BR>Samuel Jackson gave what I thought was a laughingly poor performance as a wise Jedi.  Most of his movements and words seemed manufactured.  E.T. makes a cameo in the Senate.<br />The plot does tend to be abrupt in places, and we're never told exactly why Naboo is so important to trade in the Republic.  Palpatine's ascension to Supreme Chancellor was completely unbelievable, and we're also never told why the former Chancellor, although a strong supporter of Naboo and apparently an independent thinker, was under such tight control of the bureaucrats.  <br />The Jedi battles were much better than the originals, but I'll never understand why they have to use swords in the first place.  At several points in the battles, the Jedi simply wave their hand at the droids and kill them.  Why would you choose to fight when you can wave your hand?  Why did Obi-Wan have to stare through the red shields at the end?  He could have cut his way through the SIDES, cutting AWAY the little rotating shield generators.  He also could have used the Force through the room, ripping up the floor underneath Darth Maul or throwing objects his way.  Oh well.

B00005LQ04|2.0|when it's all said and done, I felt like I COULD'VE done something else.  It's the kind of movie that I don't regret watching, but really have a small need to see very often, but may want to in about 10 years.  The first attack was the best.  The rest of them were noticeable to kinda silly.  It has a good use of sound, color, and atmosphere, and recommended for viewing, but not more than the initial time, which took 3 viewings before I was able to reach the end.  Worthy of credit, but a high level of acclaim is not what I would bestow to this title.  Maybe I just saw it too late in my life(2001 vs. early 80s).

0679879269|5.0|What odd ideas people get! Pullman stupid? He thinks America is full of fundies? He he! Anyway, I used to be dissapointed with this book after the glory of The Golden Compass and the slightly less glory of The Subtle Knife. But its grown on me. I was nitpicking before, which is fine: it's good to know a books faults. But I don't care about them any more. Sure, it's flawed, but overall, it's magnificent. If the structure is a little weak, and the ending slightly confused, the book still comes off as sweeping, with a powerful force behind it.<br />As for talk of hateful anti-Church-ism, firstly: so what? If a writer wants to express any opinion at all, even one you don't like, it's their right to do so. Secondly, it wasn't overbearing. Pullman knows how to write. It wasn't a liteny against the evil of the Church. He gently raised some isses (not made up, they are issues in our own world too) and pointed out some things. He gave another opinion on the fall - not by preaching against Christian teachings, but with the ending that was its own story. So don't be put off if you're a Christian. Surely a true believer SHOULD read this, because blind faith is nothing - only with an informed brain is faith valuable.

0440234743|4.0|After being disappointed with 'The Street Lawyer', 'The Chamber', and particularly 'A Painted House', I was convinced I wasn't going to read my copy of 'The Testament', which had been sitting on my bookshelf with several other unread books. However, I plucked up the courage and dived in.<br />I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Though it's a gentler, slower-flowing story than such as 'The Pelican Brief', it has a charm of its own and, after the first couple of chapters, I was well hooked.<br />A billionaire dies and leaves his whole estate to an illegitimate daughter. The relatives contest the will and Nate O'Reilly goes in search of the missing heiress. His meeting with Rachel Lane, the reluctant heiress, becomes pivotal in his fight against drug and alcohol addiction.<br />My only reason for not giving five stars was that I felt O'Reilly's conversion was a bit too contrived. It felt totally unnatural. However, all said, a satisfying book that left me content at the last page.

He doesn't just explain what the chords, scales and frets are; he shows you the patterns, the whys and the know-how to put everything together.  Just get it and play!
0446310786|5.0|Here is a perfect example of a coming-of-age tale that refuses to be either melodramatic, mushy, or even boring! A story that should be read again and again. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the classic novel written in 1960 by Harper Lee to great critical acclaim, received the Pulitzer in 1961 and became a classic film in 1962 starring Gregory Peck as the hero Atticus Finch.<br />We are in the life and times of 1930s Alabama, the town of Maycomb County, as seen through the eyes of a young tomboyish girl named Jean Louise Finch, or &quot;Scout&quot; as she is called by her widowed lawyer father Atticus and her older brother Jeremy &quot;Jem&quot; Finch. <br />The span of the story takes place within three years of their lives. From their summer get-togethers with their young friend Dill from Meridian, Mississippi; to their adventures in trying to make their mysterious neighbor Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley come outside; to the courtroom drama of black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white woman by the name of Mayella Ewell. <br />All characters are positively wonderful! There's the Finchs' black maid, Calpurnia, who acts like the children's mother and guardian; their colorful neighbors: Miss Maudie Atkinson, Miss Stephanie Crawford, and Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose; the town's sheriff Mr. Heck Tate, and the Ewells. All involved help move along the story with both poignancy and humor. The ending of the book, where Scout and Jem are saved by Boo Radley, is perhaps the sweetest moment in any book. The connection between the little girl and the mysterious man is heartbreaking! <br />Harper Lee created a kind of hero to us in creating Atticus Finch, the strong, stalwart man who never hit his children, much less yell at them. Even when Jem and Scout would get into trouble, he would always be there with his broad shoulders and comforting arms. Gregory Peck, in the film, was the ideal choice for Atticus Finch, and won the Best Actor Oscar for it as well.<br />My only complaint,and this is usually with all books and novels, is too much detail to the surroundings of the characters. There are moments when Miss Lee tends to fill about five pages with description of Alabama during the Great Depression. That, to me, tends to slow the story down. Even THE GODFATHER had that same problem, even though it too is a great book.<br />All in all, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD lives up to its reputation as a very important and classic novel.

0385495323|5.0|I'm using this book as a text in a computer ethics class I teach at an area University.  The students are eating this material up like it was candy.  Singh's book is well-written and engaging (in a dry way), including enough technical detail to intrigue the computer science majors in my class and enough detail about the people involved to keep the non-technical majors interested as well.  I personally find the last chapter on &quot;Quantum computing&quot; and &quot;Quantum cryptography&quot; to be less good than the other chapters, but overall, this book is really, really good stuff.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|This movie, while admittedly lacking in aspects of character development, provided an overall enjoyable action ride.  The stunt work was awesome, and the cinematography/special effects weren't bad either.  I actually liked the absuridity of the plot, as a student of archaeology, in that it provided a nice fantasy, and didn't confuse too much fact with fiction (though I loved the Indy movies, they didn't do much to help the cause of true archaeologists to educate the public on matters ancient).  And, really, the absuridity of this movie is no less than that of 'Temple of Doom' (a Thuggee temple?  come on...).  I'd say it was more realistic in many ways....  All in all, it was an enjoyable movie.  If you're a fan of the games, or stunt-filled action flicks, buy it.  If not, rent it anyway.  Hey, it's better than 'The Mummy Returns'... (I'd even argue, better than ToD).
B00005N83M|4.0|Jennifer Lopez's &quot;J.Lo&quot; may come as a bit of a shock to some. After all, we get that explicit content warning from JUST ONE SONG! Throughout the CD, Jennifer proves that her style and attitude have changed. Everything about the CD is just a bit startling. I remember listing to &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot; the first time, and wondering where songs like that were on the last CD. <br /> My favorite tracks:<br />&quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot;- Very cute song. Not the most original in the world, but different from other pop songs at the time it was released. 9/10<br />&quot;I'm Real&quot;- This is my second favorite of the album. Very powerful, defiant, strong and sweet all at the same time. It includes a strong backbeat and very interesting theme. 10/10<br />&quot;Play&quot;- This one gets a bit repetitive, but as long as it's used for a dance track, it's very easily enjoyed. 7/10<br />&quot;Ain't It Funny&quot; This is by far the best of the album. The fresh salsa style, the playful lyrics and the sweet theme- this song is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Jennifer Lopez track. 10/10<br />&quot;Dame&quot;- The Spanglish song meaning &quot;Touch Me&quot; or &quot;Touch,&quot; though somewhat on the erotic style of Latin diva Shakira, it is a fabulous, fabulous song. 10/10<br />&quot;I'm Real&quot; Feat. Ja Rule- Really not even remotely similar to the first track, Jennifer takes on a &quot;ghetto superstar&quot; role just as she took on the part of Selena in her late 90's movie- with little true emotion and an inability to relate. It is a very good theme for a song, but it could use to be cleaned up a bit. I think Jennifer needs to realize she IS NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN before releasing another album. Stick to Spanish, stick to pop, even take on a little R&amp;B, but don't ruin your good songs by swearing all the way through them.  6/10<br /> All in all, I think she needs to realize who she is- and who she isn't- and the next album will be an enormous success. Oh,and I have full certainty that the lovely Ms. Lopez will have another album.<br />Hope I helped!

B00005LK94|5.0|In the world of DVD, it is quite fashionable to talk about &quot;must-have&quot; DVDs, mostly because of the disks' technological superiority. But the Special Edition DVD of Fly Away Home is a disk that does genuinely belong in every movie lover's collection. The disk is full of extras and is beautifully rendered, but it is the film itself that makes this DVD a true must-have. Fly Away Home tells the kind of story that could oh-so-easily become sentimental or melodramatic. &quot;Young teenage girl loses her mother in a car accident and goes to live with her estranged father. They learn to connect to each other, and to their own hearts, by teaching a flock of orphaned wild geese to fly.&quot; But make no mistake: this film is a first-rate family classic. It's the kind of movie that you cannot stop watching. The acting is honest and understated; the cinematography is superb (just about every single shot in this film could be put up on the wall, that's how beautiful the pictures are); the music is spot-on, moving from romantic to quirky moods with grace and ease; and Carroll Ballard's direction is just perfection, simply because you never notice it: he lets the story tell itself in images, in all its simplicity and beauty -- only at the end do you stop to realize that, oh yes, someone must have directed this film. And then there's the geese, the real stars of the film. Every time you see them take to the sky in this film's gloriously beautiful sequences, following Amy in her flying machine, they tell us the simplest and most profound of thuths: that this world is beautiful, and that we must not let it go to waste. In an age when movies seem to be mostly about machines, explosions and violence, Fly Away Home comes as an eloquent reminder of what really matters: that we take good care of the people that we love, and that we must never lose the courage to dream.
0440180295|5.0|I read this book in Grade 11, because it was recommended to me and is considered to his greatest work. It's not exactly his greatest, but it's way up there. If this book isn't to oyur liking, then maybe Kurt Vonnegut isn't for you. I love it, and ever since I've read it, Vonnegut has become one of my favorite authors.
0345413377|4.0|The Golden Compass and the beginning of the Subtle Knife create the most powerful and unique world I have ever seen.  However, the promise they set up and the expectations I had for the rest of the series became so high that it could not be fulfilled.  Pullman tries to take on an entire philosophy of life, and in the Amber Spyglass he seems to lose some of his tight, perfect vision as he tries to cover everything at once.  It gets, frankly, too preachy as the morals become both blatant and cryptic.  Still, it is a very impressive end to one of the best trilogies I've ever read, and is worth the longer read.
B000005HLV|5.0|&quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; by Mayhem is the greatest masterpiece of black metal music. It has no boundaries for description. It is great! This was the last album of Euronymous who was later killed. Vocals feature Attila from Tormentor and Aborym. Basses are arranged by Varg Vikernes, the murderer of Euronymous. Drums are by Hellhammer. Mayhem's triumph is &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.&quot;<br />First of all, the album is cold, dark, black, desperate, grim, hopeless, disgusting, evil, pessimistic, ugly, mad, insane, filthy, dim, ghastly, horrible etc. All these apply to this album. That's what makes &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; an excellent work.<br />Euronymous' guitars are, as always, great! Basses of Varg Vikernes ( or Hellhammer's in later editions ) rock! Drums are tight and fast. The vocals are masterpiece! Attila's voice is a mixture of falsetto, growls, screams and rasps, which tone the album perfectly.<br />The greatest masterpiece of black metal! The essential meaning of black metal!
B000002P6R|5.0|Some of the people below can complain all they want and slag the band for carrying on without Keith. They can also tell you how dreadful they think this album is because everyone has an opinion, but the truth is they are wrong. If Face Dances doesn't agree with your musical taste, then fine, but the problem doesn't lie in the quality of the songs or musicianship. <br />As along time Who fan, I'm not going to try and convince anyone that this album is as good or better than Tommy or Who's Next,but it is as good or better than some of their work. Despite what other's may say, all the songs here, both Pete and John's, are great songs. You Better You Bet, Cache Cache, Don't Let Go The Coat, and Another Tricky Day are as catchey and well contructed as anything Pete has done and the Quiet One and You are definitely two of the best songs Entwistle has ever written. The Quiet One and You are also as abrasive and raw as any studio tracks the Who ever did. Those songs come as close to the claasic Who live sound as anything.<BR> <BR>I would also like to say that I was as sad as any other true fan when Keith Moon died,but I don't feel the rest of the band betrayed his memmory by carrying on. I also think that trashing Kenny Jones is pretty childish as well. I don't  know if any of the other critics below are musicians or not, but I am and I thought Kenny's playing on both Face Dances and It's Hard was very impressive. He may not have had the frenzied , almost out of control style that made Keith so great, but his inventive use of varied rhythms and beats had alot of impact on the songs here.<br />The bottom line here is, Face Dances may not be the best Who album, but it is a very good one.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|When i came home with Thriller, a remaster, i couldnt believe what i was hearing.  The songs are the same, but you sorta get closer to mike through the bonus items on the cd.  To me, this CD was a must buy at the store because i couldnt believe what rythem Mike had back then.  Even listening to his new stuff...i can say hes one of the few artists from the 80s that can change, and make new stuff with new eras.<br />People, start your engines.  Michael mania is about to start again, and Thriller, the remaster is just the start.  its got all his greatest hits.  Forget about Nsync or Backstreet Boys.  They are good, but Michael Jackson takes all pop and R and B and makes into something out of this world.<br />Buy Thriller and you will be doing yourself a favor for the rest of your life.
068484267X|3.0|If you're reading this review for the purpose of deciding whether to read 'Angela's Ashes,' I'll save you some time by suggesting you read the first page. The author tips his hand very early:<br />&quot;When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while.&quot;<br />If this sounds attractive, by all means read on but be warned: when he says miserable, he *means* it.<br />Before confronting misery, though, I must comment on an aspect of this best-seller I've not yet seen discussed in any great detail: that this &quot;memoir&quot; must be largely a fake. I simply refuse to believe that Mr. McCourt can remember childhood details (like word-for-word parental conversations on important subjects) at the tender ages -- not to mention conditions -- that he claims. Ask yourself if you can remember exact accounts of when you were three or four-much less whole adult conversations-and you'll see my point. Simply put, a lot of this probably didn't happen -- at least as meticulously written. <br />And so what? One could easily claim he got the gist of it right, and aren't the Irish a bit prone to, as they say, a bit of embellishment anyway? Well, sure, but a memoir is a memoir and you can't have it both ways. Make no mistake, however--in the area of Irish license Frank McCourt is dead on. Having had an Irish Catholic upbringing meself (though not the tooth and claw version practiced in the home country), I can verify many of his details personally. In describing everything from eccentric relatives to the bewilderingly complex nature of Catholic sacraments, the author betrays a sure hand. While this doesn't quite excuse passing his book off as an autobiography, McCourt still engages and entertains.<br />The author's means of bringing details to the surface deserve particular attention. The book's rambling, conversational, stream-of-consciousness style seems custom-made for his subject:<br />&quot;If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.&quot;<br />While occasionally hard to read, this self-evoking grammar ultimately can't be divorced from McCourt's story and certainly brought his characters to life for me far better than stiff formal dialogue.<br />Between these exchanges, McCourt also has the opportunity to exercise his considerable descriptive powers. While I accuse the author of some creative forgery, in an evocative capacity he's nearly redeemed; I heard and especially *smelled* what he describes.  A world of smoky, sticky pubs and homes in squalid lanes lacking indoor plumbing comes pungently alive.<br />With style as his strong suit, Mr. McCourt also brings considerable power to his substance.  The substance, however, is so bleak it borders on suicidal. This is a very dark, naturalistic, and occasionally horrifying book. Nearly everyone--save the children--is devoid of simple human values. Adults are portrayed as maniacally depressed or angry and hardly shy about attempting to destroy the psyches of everyone within earshot--especially the children. His parents don't escape notice; Dad is the very definition of alcoholic (to the point of drinking away money for his family's basis subsistence), Mam a desperate nebbish ultimately reduced to begging and prostituting herself--and it's far from clear that she's doing this exclusively for the family's benefit. I certainly share the author's astonishment at his survival; if you can stand over 400 funereal pages of this, then by all means dive in.<br />And maybe survival is the point here, but it's surely a bleak one; every triumph (Dad get a job, the author finds a soulmate) is swiftly crushed withina few pages. Even so, McCourt ends on a high note and rather obviously sets up a sequel. And though I've not read the follow-up (&quot;'Tis&quot;), if I ever did it would be with some trepidation. Having endured a childhood littered with demonic authority figures, the author leaves us on the cusp of his own adulthood. I shudder to think of who he might become -- but of course we already know, since this continuing &quot;memoir&quot; can only come from the same gifted writer before us.
B00000337U|4.0|I hadn't heard this album in years, and my first impression was that it sounded a bit dated.  The production values and general sound clearly place the piece in the 1970's.  <br />Very quickly though I was struck by the sense that there is something clean and fresh about the album.  There's an exuberance of people playing songs they like and having fun doing it. There are times when it borders on pop, and the rock-n-roll sensibilities are never far from the surface.  However, the musicianship, harmony and improvisation are clearly the product of highly disciplined and talented jazz musicians.<br />You'll find it easy on the ear on your first listen, and after a few more you'll discover you can't get the quirky little melodies stuck out of your head.  The songs have that pleasant characteristic of being both comfortable and unexpected.  Put it on as background music and watch as your friends try to put their fingers on just what they're listening to. <br />I heartily recommend.
0440219078|5.0|This is one of the best books i've ever read, Lowry's imagination is incredible. this is a book like no other, it's set in a totally different world, probably the future as Lowry sees it. This is a very unique book, there aren't many like it, or as good. It's a story about a boy who lives in a strange, utopian (rather wanna-be-utopian) society and is faced with many problems. Even though his problems are totally different than ours, you can really realate to him, it makes you think of our world from a different perspective.<BR>I STRONGLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK!!!
0786889284|3.0|This is the fourth Pearson book I have read. As in the first three the characters are great. I like Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews. If Boldt does become a Lieutenant I don't think it will be as good. The character of Ben was very good. Would like to see him again as he grows up. Lets you use your imagination, you can just see the things as they happen. My reason for a three was the length of the book. Paper back--644 pages. I nearly put it down several times because I was past ready for it to be over. A lot of thought and feeling could have been left out. In my humble openion around 400 to 425 pages is plenty. If you like a good mystery that is very looooonnnnnng. You will like this.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. Remember Feargal Sharkey? Lots of buzz. Remember Tin Machine? Lots of buzz. Remember Duck Sauce? Lots of Buzz. ... Anyway, The Strokes have received much buzz as well. Their growing fame blazed over the ocean and sparkled the eyes and hearts and ears of the British press. Now, with the domestic release of Is This It (no \\"?\\"--as if the suggestion is silly at best) The Strokes get to see if their \\"buzz-mentum\\" continues. While, I don't think you'll be seeing them on TRL (and one would really hope not), this band is about as close to a sure thing as you can get. There is not a lame song on here.  While owing to The Stooges and Velvet Underground, they still come away very much their own band. ... The songs are lyrical, the music is enthralling, blah, blah, blah--it rocks. I've made myself go to YMCA recently (love handles, aargh!) and have listened to Is This It while sweating it out on the treadmill. \\"The Modern Age\\" and \\"Someday\\" are particularly conducive to this activity. Musical ginseng. Made me feel like I was Utta Pipig or Alberto Salazar or Kenyan. Finally, what makes this record truly great is that it feels like NYC.  From top to bottom. It's an inspiring tribute. And although they had to leave off \\"NYC Cops\\" for the US release, the replacement \\"When It Started\\" is a bouncy, fun little number. And as those in the know know, I'm all about bouncy and fun little numbers. I feel like I'm crusing the Village at some odd hour when listening to The Strokes.  ...
158234082X|4.0|I bought this book for a six-hour flight and chuckled the whole way. Before reading the book becoming a chef was always a distant fantasy. Not anymore! Anthony Bourdain does not hold back in regards to revealing trade secrets, his opinions of select celebrity chefs, common obscenities used in the work place and his generalization of which nationalities work best together in a kitchen. He tells great stories about his experiences in various NYC restaurants such as Supper Club and Les Halles. It has the same fast pace tempo that many New Yorkers are familiar with. Being a native New Yorker I felt right at home reading this book and finished wanting more.
B00000DCHI|4.0|Covering Joel's career from the early 70's to the mid 80's, this collection does a fine job of capturing the different styles of music that Joel was able to incorporate successfully into his diverse albums. From ballads to rockers, to story songs, there was little limit to what Joel was able to accomplish. The basic difficulty with any greatest hits package for an artist of this skill is that his albums often represented a particular sound he was working with at the time, so any collection sounds like a mixture that lacks focus. However if you are a casual fan or someone who is looking for a nice assembly of hits, this should do it for you.
B000005RTG|4.0|Fans of  the band in the 70's could somehow live with Purple without Gillan. But Purple without Blackmore?! No way man. That was too much. So they missed &quot;Come taste the band&quot;, and marked it, without listening, as Purple's worst ever (again - I'm talking about the 70's!!). That's the reason for that album to be such an unknown even by DP fans. But Blackmore is not God, and today we can take &quot;Come taste the band&quot; out of its grave, and give it an objective opinion. Though it's not equal to Mk2 best trio (Machine head, Fireball and In rock),it's better than Mk3 &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;Stormbringer&quot;. Coverdale and Hughs took the band's music style to America, far from its basic English roots, and I don't always like it. Funny, but the American guitarist Bollin took them back to England. The songs are shorter and most of them are heavier then &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, exactly like we expected from an English heavy rock band. .

B00005QB9A|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best films I have ever seen.  I'm just amazed at how many people are totally unaware of this film.  Such flowing romantic motion and masterful cinematic art is found in this beautifully directed and acted film.  Tremendous storyline.  I would suggest the film execs to re-release this one with better marketing this time...but then again those of us who are aware of it could just keep it to ourselves.  Tim Roth is King.
630349255X|5.0|Think of poetry and it's relationship to language as the most potent, expressive use of language.  Now, change the word 'poetry' to Baraka and 'language' to film.  <br />Baraka is a daring, beautiful, heartbreaking meditation on the separateness and sameness of people.  It's  a vision of the grandeur of nature, the depth of spirit and worship, the assembly line feeling of urban life.  <br />By all means watch this film, let it take you where it goes and your mind will be full.
B00003CX5P|4.0|All in All its a great movie. I just got it on release date and I surely say this movie was fun and enjoyable. Its like the new beginning of Star Wars. Luke Skywalker in Phantom Menance is a child and is gonna be the next Jedi Knight!! I had no problems understanding the movie at all. The only reason why I had 4-stars is b/c it seems there are 2 parts in the picture that the screen flickerd and messed up in video (no its not my dvd player).<br />But its a hype movie but sure can back it up!!
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is one of the top movies I never get tried of seeing. I<br />already had the VHS verion, but words can't express what a big<br />difference seeing this movie on DVD. There are so many extras<br />with this Collector's Edition especially on how the movie was<br />made etc. I think that I watched this part about five times the<br />same day that I receeived my DVD. Once again this movie is tops<br />in my eyes.....00
6304613199|3.0|Although shallow, contrived, and practically plotless, the Jurassic Park sequel The Lost World does deliver the thrills when the dinos come out to stomp, roar, and devour the supporting cast and lead bad guys.  The movie is a tad darker than the first and features a bitter taste of greedy cynicism, but the T-rex rampaging through San Diego is every monster fan's dream come true (and gives screenwrier David Koepp his just deserts for delivering such an illogical and insulting storyline), and that sequence is the sole reason for the three stars as opposed to two.  A big budget cinematic equal to substandard big bug schlock like Earth v The Spider or War of the Colossal Beast.  Worth seeing once only for the San Diego segment.
B00005QJDG|5.0|I don't usually buy live cd's but I made an exception for this one and I'm glad I did. I'm 51 and in my humble opinion this is the best live cd I'v heard and flows extremely well. I don't have any problem setting aside 3+ hours to listen to it in it's entirety. Paid $... cdn for this (excellent value) and got the original slip cover edition with the original cover. It was covered by a sticker that was easily removed but that is incidental to the great tunes.More prog metal than prog rock but a must for all fans of either genre.
B000002OOY|4.0|While John Williams's score for Jurassic Park does not do for dinos what his score for Jaws did for sharks, namely give them a simple and memorable theme that can both raise a smile and gooseflesh, his work is excellent nonetheless.  The majestic theme perfectly captures the magical character of the film, while the Opening Titles and Dennis Steals the Embryo tracks have a nice creepy edge to theme, letting the listener feel the threat lurking in the Park's very real jungle.  Fans of Jurassic Park or John Williams, or both, need no prodding to add this to their collections.  Recommended.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Film purists have praised this film endlessly. Film novices are in awe. Regular everyday people are riveted by the entertaining narrative. Every film afficianado has been waiting for the DVD release of this film, and no one could possibly be disappointed. A fine quality transfer is great, but the second disc, the documentary, is every bit as riveting as the film itself. Loaded with extras, as only a film of this stature could be accepted, it's hard to imagine a finer version. The greatest film of all time? Perhaps. CITIZEN KANE paved the way for film technique from its inception. Even the boredom scenes (Susan stuck in Xanadu while her friends are playing) are anything but boring. It's a rapid-fire screenplay about a megalomaniac...who you actually felt sorry for. What was Hearst so upset about?
6303148352|3.0|Jurassic Park, while exciting and awesome in parts, is no Jaws.  The movie is really an excuse for Spielberg to mount the greatest Ray Harryhausen movie never made, and he succeeds far too brilliantly.  The commentary and conscious of Crichton's terrifying novel is disposed of in favor of easy thumbnail sketch characters and simplistic narrative tools to make the monster movie machine hum right along.  Once the dinosaurs do get loose the movie drops any pretense of developing or even caring about the 'characters' and invites the audience to simply enjoy the spectacle of the attacks.  The pioneering effects may make this an essential in some collections, but the lack of dramatic weight makes it no more effective that its 1950s drive-in cinema cousins The Black Scorpion or The Deadly Mantis.  Recommended just for the thrill of it all.
630575067X|5.0|This movie is...well, to tell it like it is, JUST SPECTACULAR!! In this movie the pieces of the Star Wars puzzle start coming together.  We learn the past of many characters and are intruduced to more!!!!!!!!  The sound and computer special affects are absolutely great, not to mention the lightsaber duels which if you watch closely they are sure to awe you!!!  <BR>I saw Star Wars when I was seven years old, and I never even thought that there could be more to the story, but THERE IS!! and THIS IS IT!!!  I grew up with Star Wars, and just to prove that,i'll tell you a past experiance. I thought I was the fastest reader in the world when I managed to read the long yellow intro that seems to drift up into space in the beginning of every movie.  Well, enough of the boring stuff, but anyway, the acting is well done, the plot is interesting, and STAR WARS IS BACK!!!!
B00005NWRS|4.0|This album has a very nice blend of acoustic, bluegrass, and alternative country.  Ryan Adams' voice gets beeter and better with every album.  Adams has progressed leaps and bounds since his Whiskeytown days with a flow that is a throwback to the 60's such as the likes of Dylan.
6305089957|4.0|The Scream series is a true enigma. It seems you either love the film's or you hate them. One thing I've found though when speaking to the fans, is that Scream 2 seems to be the least popular of the trilogy. My personal belief is that it's the only installment that is actually a proper horror film.<br />Let me explain... The biggest problem with 'Scream' is it's a hollywood horror film. Experimental maybe, but while it deconstructs the genre left right and centre, it is ultimately as cliched as the slasher films that preceeded it. Only now instead of the sex = death rule, we have a new set of rules for horror films. Rules set by studio executives. Such rules are as follows.<br />1. You must cast only stars that can be recognised from popular TV shows to make it appeal to the young generation.<br />2. You must include an ultra commercial soundtrack that bears no thematic or emotional link to the film whatsoever.<br />3. You must conform to MTV standards to make the film appeal, and be user friendly to a wider audience usually with lots of comedic elements.<br />Basically the new 'mass apeal' horror flicks are very washed down. The first Scream suffered from this a bit, although I did find it enjoyable. Scream 3 on the other hand is completely designed for mass audiences. No 'I Spit On Your Grave' style gut wrenching pain and certainly no 'Evil Dead' style rape scenes. Everything's nice and easy and clean cut. The only original thing about the first Scream was that it managed to use other films idea's so well that people didn't recognise it!<br />Scream 2 is the only entry in the series that is darker. The characters are mostly well defined (even if most of them are annoying), but for once it doesn't conform to the happy 'geek gets the girl' motif. Instead the geek gets slashed and diced beyond recognition. The tone of the film is a lot darker than the other entries in the series. Okay not to the extent of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', but it does at least try to be depressing, and that's what horror should be. The reason the teeny bopper types like this film least, is because it's not as 'happy jolly' style as the other two. This one at least tries to hurt the audience a little bit. Yeah okay so there is still the pop soundtrack and TV pop stars. Yeah okay so you may wish Sidney would just die because she's so damn normal it's sickening. But the fact is Scream 2 is the only one of the series that is a proper horror film because it actively says the good ar epunished far more than the bad. At least this one isn't all happy jolly and for that reason it's worth a watch.
B000024ECB|5.0|Over the years, Earth Wind &amp; Fire have released a number of Greatest Hits albums, but this is the only single-disc compilation I could find on Amazon which contains the magnificent 'Fall in Love with Me'.<br />It's been over twenty years since I last heard many of these tracks. Remastered, they positively sparkle. But then, from about 'September' onwards, EWF always did go in for big<br />production numbers.  Sometimes Maurice White paid too much attention to the detail of the arrangement and too little to the strength of the underlying song.  Take the music of 'That's the Way of the World', for example: superb chorus, good arrangement, great singing, great harmonies ... but the tune underlying each verse is somewhere between plain and non-existent.  Maybe the real problem is that it's as if Maurice White had spent just too much listening to Hall &amp; Oates's ABANDONED LUNCHEONETTE. Twenty years on, even 'September' sounds like a re-working of Andrew Gold's 'Oh, What a Lonely Boy'.<br />For me, EWF represent the marriage of disco, soul and Disney: black music seasoned with the highest production values, dressed up with a lot of pizzazz.  They created music for a world audience of any colour or creed.<br />Hits like 'Boogie Wonderland' have received too much airplay over the years, drenching our shopping malls at barely audible volumes.  That's how good songs get killed.  My favourites tunes on this album are 'Let's Groove', 'Can't Let Go' and 'Fall in Love with Me'.  I just cannot resist (when I'm alone!) trying to sing along with Philip Bailey's falsetto.<br />EWF were never the same once Bailey had left to sing with Phil Collins. But this album is how I will remember them, singing to the heavens, gloriously adorned, and giving the latter half of the 1970s much to be jubilant about.
1573221562|5.0|Sarah Waters' Affinity is a beautiful novel.  The author captures a time with tremondous skill and evokes a atmosphere, both Gothic and Victorian, until it is practically dripping from the page.  Her real skill is in providing a story that is as absorbing as the atmosphere swirling around it.  This woman visitor, Margaret Prior, to the women's ward of Millbank prison provides a character and a narrative voice to carry the reader through both the chill of cold horror and the warmth of her erotic tinglings with equal skill.  The spiritualist prisoner she meets in prison, Selina Dawes, is a wonderful and original fictional creation that will haunt the reader as much as it does the lady visitor.  A fine read.

0345350499|1.0|I had high hopes for this book, because I had heard all this good stuff about it and it SUX!<br />I read about 200 pages of it and then I just dropped it flat.  I completely lost interest in the first 50 pages or so but I was forcing myself to read more in case it got better later on, some books do u know?  Well, that never happend.<br />A lot of the reviews discuss the problems the book had with Chrisianity and such, which is cool, but my main problem with the book wasn't with the plot or the message/opinion's of the authur, it was that I hated most of the characters.  All the characters that were supposed to be really cool in the real king aurthur story were really mean, horrible, backstabbing, immature ppl in this story which just totally ruined the real Aurthur story for me.  I guess that's supposed to be the genius of the book or something, that the ppl are real and cruel instead of idealized creatures, but the ppl in this book are too stupid and mean to even identify with.  They aren't making mistakes, they are intentionally ruining their lives and blaming it on someone else.  Nothing about the characters was inspirational or redeeming once you got to know them,  blah :P  Read this book for fun if that's your kind of thing, but don't expect anything great from it.
B00000DFSK|5.0|While I agree with some reviewers that some songs that weren't included should have been, and there is certainly room on this cd that runs at 65 mins in length, for at least a couple more songs. And, yes, some songs are shorter than the album versions, which I presume means that they are the single edits. Again, the cd length allowed for the full versions to have been included, but for some reason they weren't. I have no idea why they weren't, and on these points the album really deserves 4 stars, but because the music really is exceptional, and U2 is a great band, and I love these songs, I have to give it 5 stars. The booklet has no lyrics but a lot of photos of the band over the years.
0800177363|5.0|DeNiro is one of the finest actors in the world today.  Robin Williams couldn't act his way out of a melodrama.  Put these two together and see how DeNiro outclasses Williams completely.  DeNiro is superb as the patient.  Williams is lousy, as usual, as the doctor.  Williams was irksome as Mork and continues to be irksome in his succeeding roles.  He needs to visit an acting coach who can convince him to give up acting for the good of the country.  DeNiro justs needs to be in every picture that comes out.  With him in pictures the other actors have someone who can challenge them to reach their finest moments as actors.  Williams, sadly, didn't rise to meet the challenge and continues to nauseate in every picture he puts out.  I gave this movie five stars because of DeNiro.  Williams gets zero stars just because he exists and is always reminding people of it.
B000002OYB|4.0|Although it can't match his &quot;Bat&quot; albums, I still thoroughly enjoy this cd. Even the Dianne Warren penned songs. Of course nothing can stay the same or it would get boring after a while, which is the reason artists like to change styles and songwriters etc every so often. And this is one of those albums. But Meatloaf is still Meatloaf, (although I have recently heard that he no longer goes by that name). I really can't find much if anything, to dislike about this album. Most fans of 'The artist previously known as Meatloaf' will love this. The 18 page booklet has all the lyrics written in a 40's style gangster/crime novel style, complete with pictures of 40's paperback crime novel covers.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot is an absolute masterpiece that no movie fan should be without. Jamie Bell makes a very remarkable performance as young Billy, who really makes you wonder how far a dream can go (what if... ?).<BR>The screenplay by Lee Hall is nothing less than extraordinary, it should've won the oscar... 'Always be yourself. I love you forever.'<BR>This is a movie that not only shows the viewer the power of courage, but shows him how good movies can be, when all you need, and all you want to see is a movie that can make you smile or cry (or both) in less than a minute.
0920668364|1.0|I, too, am a book lover who would never throw one away, but this is the creepiest weirdest story ever. It never made it to our bookshelf. I have polled all of my friends, and we all agree. Read it before you buy it for your child or anyone else's child!
B00000J7I3|5.0|When Motley Crue was recording this album I bet they didn't know what they were doing and what they were doing was a classic rock album that usually you don't on any band (not even punk bands). The high-point on the album is Mick Mars on the guitar. A lot of people spend most of their life getting this crunchy sound and they can't get it.  Steve Vai can be a &quot;virtuoso&quot; on the guitar and Joe Satriani can show us all the scales in the world, but the sound on the guitar of this record is like a drill directly to your brain.<br />I have bought this album like 3 or 4 times (I used it so many times that end up like an old pair of sneakers) and if I need to buy it one more time I'll buy it again as many times as I need to get this songs.  I mean, living a life and don't hear LIVE WIRE, TOO FAST FOR LOVE, PUBLIC ENEMY #1, MERRY GO ROUND, ON WITH THE SHOW and the rest of the songs it's NO living at all.<br />Do you travel a lot on your car??? Get this one. Not ONE song is bad.
B00005Q5WC|5.0|There are so many great things about Exodus. . .I think this album has been eclipsed by the popular greatest hits collections over the years, but it stands as a monument to love and peace and righteousness. Great thing #1. This is another of Universals top  of the line&quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; reissues. That means great packaging, additional liner notes, and digital remastering. Listening to this Jammin' compared to my 1989 Legend version is like day and night. This totally pops. Great thing #2. The liner notes. The notes reground the album in the political and personal events in Marley's life. Its important to remember that these songs were written right after his assassination attempt. . .and after Rita was injured. These love songs are for her. And for Jamaica which was ripping apart. I think the assassination attempt also inserted a sense of urgency to many of these tracks. The notes also reminds us how Junior Marvin (BRILLIANT!) joined Marley at this time, and how his funky background may have influenced Exodus. And finally, the notes reconnect Marley with musical touchstone Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, mostly on the additional tracks. Great Thing #3. The Additional Tracks. The live tracks from the Rainbow are the best. This band cooked like few others of the era. I had heard the Punky Reggae Party tracks before on bootlegs, but here they are pristine. The final track thrown on is the original radio ad for Exodus. Uni did this for Marvin Gaye and other albums in the Deluxe series and I like this. It takes me back to 77/78 and WPLJ! (who played marley on saturday nights I seem to recall.)<BR>This is a beautiful funky album - Marley's best in my opinion. This edition is a must have for Reggae fans and for Marley devotees.<BR>&quot;The thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain.&quot; Bob Marley.
B000001FQQ|3.0|If I had reviewed this album when I was in high school, I would have told you that this was the 80's record and nobody could match this quality.  Well, we are more than 10 years away from that days and I have strongly change my mind about it.  With time you have a better opinion on things and situations.  A great album is the one that doesn't matter how long it's been on the market or how long you heard it for the first time, it's still a GREAT ALBUM and makes you want to listen over and over again.<br />I can't say that this album is bad or you don't want to listen to it, is just that it doesn't fit in the KISS collection.<br />The secuency of the songs it doesn't make sense, some songs are good, some are bad and to save the day: FOREVER.  Gene is at his worst writting songs. Prisioner of Love, Betrayed, Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell......now I know why they didn't play them on ANY tour (not even unplugged). Paul makes a big effort to make this record worth it; Rise to it: Good, but maybe WARRANT could have play it better; Hide Your Heart, Great for a movie or even a TV-series soundtrack; Silver Spoon, Great song and I mean it; King of Hearts, Great song and I mean it, too; The best song is Forever, it came out when a lot hard rock ballads were on radio and KISS knew how to handle it making this song radio-friendly. Little Caesar, I guess it was too late for Eric to prove he was a great musician, anyways, a great song.<br /><br />I can say anything you want about this album, but the reason you'll buy it, it's because is KISS (and you have to ask first if you are not a big fan, it doesn't say anything on the cover).<br /><br />I don't like to review KISS this bad, but can you explain why this cd it's been on my closet for more than 5 years without listening to it???<br /><br />Highlight: Forever, Hide your heart.<br />Lowlight: Read my body, Cadillac dreams, and, of course, THE COVER.

B000001DTM|5.0|A sonic masterpiece of epic proportions...ahhhh, melody, hooks, passion, electricity...it is all here!  I consider this one of THE greatest albums ever made.  This is U2 at their best, their most experimental, and their most heartfelt.  Own this album.<BR>Feel this album.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Many people are critical of this film, and for the non-Star Wars freak that maybe true.  However, for those who are fans of the books and the movies, this film is terrific.  Yes, I will admit that Jar Jar is annoying, but so was C3-PO when the original trilogy came out.  The true charm to this film is the explaination it depicts of many unanswered questions that the films and books have created.  From the actual incarnation of creatures and aliens that our minds eye has not been able to create to the explaination of how Jabba the Hutt gained his power. (and what a female Hutt looked like)  This is what this trilogy is intended to do.<br />On top of that, Mr. Lucas and company did a fantastic job casting this film.  Everyone from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did a fantastic job playing the noble characters of an age in which the chivalrous order of the Jedi were the elite of the galaxy.  Young Anakin was portrayed fantastically...he was portrayed as a kid...exactly what he should be, and exactly what Luke was in Episode IV.  Overall, this is a film about introducing characters and explaining an unknown universe to a populace that already knows the ending and Mr. Lucas and company did a fantastic job!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I've had this CD for many months now and it still blows me away.  Song after song after song after song.  You just start singing to Love Me Do and continue right through to the last word in The Long and Winding Road.  Plus if you play this in your car CD with passengers you will find the whole car singing along with you. Everyone has their own favorite Beatles tunes so I won't go through the songlist other than to note that a follow up album with Beatles tunes that only hit the number 2 slot probably would be just as hot.  <br />One final note that you should consider:  This is not a best of the Beatles CD.  It is a CD of their number one hits.   If you want to hear Strawberry Fields or In My Life or Back in the USSR, this CD is not for you.  But if you want to hear hit after hit after hit, no other CD on the market will do it for you like this one.<br />Enjoy!
B00005M91K|5.0|We picked up the original DVD of Baraka a few months ago, and were knocked out by the film.  Upon hearing of the new release, I ordered it to see how much better the transfer is from the original (and this version cost less, too--go figure).  We ran each DVD through two different players on two different TVs.  Honestly, there isn't an appreciable difference in picture quality.  In fact, we had to boost the color when playing the new release---otherwise, colors were a little washed out.  The image clarity on each print looked to be the same, although I'd love to see a 70mm print in a big theater.  As far as the score goes, it did sound as if the remaster had a bit more presence, although that should not discredit the fidelity of the original.<br />In any case, Baraka is a captivating work of art that takes the medium to creative levels that dramatic film, or even documentary film, cannot.  Every time I watch it, I stare at the screen with childlike fascination at the images.  It takes me out of my petty little world and shows me the bigger picture, and that is why I love this film. <br />It's too bad that Koyannisqatsi is wrapped up on so much red tape, I'd like to see that on DVD at a reasonable price, too.
B000001FYL|5.0|Ever stumble upon a long lost treasure? Well this is one of them! It ranks right up there with Slippery When Wet and New Jersey. You want to hear LYRICS... pick this one up! It has the most consistent, deepest, and greatest set of lyrics I have ever seen. Every song up in this joint is the ish no doubt! As I recall, this was Bon Jovi's first try at making it alone because Richie Sambora started dating Cher. And Jon struck gold fo sho with this one with Jeff Beck. You gotta have this one in your collection... only this time, it's on CD.
0783225881|4.0|I like this movie, but I reserve 5 stars for things like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, and I don't feel that this movie is quite of classic stature. I find it touching, but a little too earnest and simple-minded to be a real classic. <br />The plot has been explained repeatedly in other reviews, so I won't bother with that. And I find no fault with the performances of any of the stars of the movie -- Kostner, et al, do excellent work. My complaint is that the movie doesn't convey the &quot;magic of baseball&quot; -- it rather assumes that you understand (and feel) that, and proceeds from there. (At least it doesn't just milk that magic the way &quot;The Natural&quot; did -- that was a beautiful movie, but a total mess otherwise.) Perhaps you had to play baseball as a kid to have this sort of nostalgic feel for the game (for me it's tied up with memories of magic hour at the end of long summer afternoons and trying to play one more inning before nightfall), and while I think that the movie uses those feelings honestly and fairly, it doesn't (to me) seem to be able to recreate (or even explain) them to someone that doesn't feel this way about baseball. <br />It's a very pretty movie, and it does a great job of giving the authentic feel of an idealized midwestern summer. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could vote that here.
6305657939|3.0|&quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; is definitely a stylish and a delicious piece of sexiness and mystery, but the slow pacing and some of the inept acting (thanks to a NYPD Blue-like Dennis Leary) get some deduction in the matter of stars.<br />Rene Russo simply sizzles as the sexy insurance investigator who goes undercover and pretends to fall in love with Thomas Crown, a sly painting theft (and falls for him in real life) to catch him. While Pierce Brosnan (who finally becomes the bad guy, instead of 007) plays the equally delicious Thomas Crown.<br />The two definitely have chemistry-sexually, most notably; Rene Russo is DEFINITELY sexy fully clothed and with her clothes off. Pierce Brosnan is the main piece in keep you guessing until the end with the plot twists and the appropriate ending that may spawn a sequel.<br />But sadly, what led me to deduct points is the inept acting and the incredibly slow pace. But otherwise, it's a sly, stylish, sexy remake of the 1969 thriller with Faye Dunaway (she also makes a appearance as Crown's therapist).<br />Rated R for sexuality/nudity and for language.
B00003652Q|5.0|This is one of the top five records of all times! Greatness from the first tune to the last. My favourite is the last song &quot;Forgotten sons&quot;. Lyrics for the brain, music for the soul, and with the spooky voice of Fish, it is fullfilled. No weak songs on the album. A strong music adventure through a melancolic landskape, that youll hope never ends. Lots of keyboards and strong guitars. So full of energy and ideas. This could have last forever, but unfortunately, it did not. Marillion died after the next album, Fugazi!
6303614493|5.0|This funny, touching fantasy/comedy is excellent in every way. Perfect comic relief, perfect plot, perfect special effects, but a sort of anemic script. Besides that, it's wickedly funny, disgusting, touching, and a perfect Halloween movie, along with the hilarious 1993 &quot;Hocus Pocus.&quot; This should top every Halloween movie list.<br />Christina Ricci does one of her best performances in this, along with the 1999 &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; and the hilarious &quot;Addams Family Values.&quot; But Bill Pullman pulls the laughs out more as the ghost psychologist. <br />This should be counted as one of the most funniest movies of 1995.<br />Rated PG for language and scary stuff.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver<BR>By Lois Lowry <br /> The Giver is about a future society where everything has gone to \\"sameness.\\"  The weather, colors, and daily routine are the same for everybody in the community every single day.  The government has done this to create a \\"perfect\\" life for everyone.  They have completely eliminated choices!  The only problem is that they have to store the memories with one person.  No one else besides the Receiver knows a thing about the past,.  It is a huge burden to bear.  The Giver, the old Receiver, and Jonas, the young, new Receiver have decided that it is time to release memories to the rest of the community.<BR> Through this book, Lois Lowry warns against the dangers of losing our rights of basic freedom.  This book has been banned because of the references to euthanasia, infanticide, and violence and sexuality, but I feel that this book is appropriate for the age group to which it was directed.  The issues that this book reveals are very real in today's times and today's children are the ones who need to learn how to deal with these topics.  I feel that she did a favor for the society of the future by introducing young readers to these topics that could very possibly get out of hand if not dealt with.
B00005QGAX|3.0|The music on this cd is great!  I really like the new songs that were added.  I've always heard that Mr. Jackson would record many extra songs for his albums.  What really disappointed me was the low number of new songs.  I also didn't understand why have all of that Quincy Jones interview on the CD.  I bought the CD to hear the music, not him talking.  Once you have heard it, why would you want to hear it again.  It really takes away from listening to the music to have him keep interrupting the flow of things.  His comments should have just been printed in the booklet.  I only bought this one.  I know that Mr. Jackson's other albums are being re-issued, but I doubt if I'll purchase them if they are full of Quincy comments.
B00003CX5P|5.0|If you are not a true Star Wars fan (not the freaks that dress up) you might have a hard time understanding the meaning behind this movie.  Episode I gives great background to help build a strong foundation for the up coming movies.  The quality of this DVD is well...a DVD.  But the extras are what makes this DVD stand out of the crowd.  The documentary of the deleted scenes and the making could be a stand alone title.  I would recommend that non-Star Wars fans watch the original trilogy again, then come back and watch Episode I.  You will then relieze the importance of this movie in the great Star Wars Saga.  I still feel that Lucas should have release the original movies before this one.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Disney have put in an outstanding effort with this Snow White DVD. The extras are worth the price of the DVD alone.It's fantastic to see interviews and film of Walt Disney through the decades.You can watch him at the film's 1937 premiere or see him in the documentaries.You can listen to his film commentary or go through the huge amount of information on this fantastic DVD.<BR>Walt says on the commentary that one of the girls that he rejected for the Snow White role(he thought that she sounded too old)turned out to be film star Deana Durban.What a pity that he didn't use her as the voice of Snow White is very thin and reedy.It is one big fault in a great film and needs to be re-recorded with a better speaking and singing voice.To those purists that would object to this,I say check out the dubbed Snow White in other languages-different voices!So why not redo the Snow White voice?It can't offend the previous voices owner as she has long been gone and the 1930's vocal style dates the film(this also applies to the Prince's vocal style as well.The dwarfs voices are perfect).They say on the DVD that they had terrible trouble animating the Prince(and it shows)so why not reanimate those few seconds as well.You would then have a perfect film.
0316776963|5.0|This book is so funny!  Many times I laughed until I cried and had to put the book down because my sides were splitting!<BR>His writing is amazing and the way he tells stories is even better than that.<BR>A must-read for everyone!!
B00002SSRZ|1.0|Whoever remixed this classic album into a DTS version has changed the mix so much that it bears little resemblance to the original.<br />Having invested in a sound system designed to enhance the listening experience, I was disappointed that this version seemed hollow and gutless. Sure, they have played around with the surround sound and included a few sections that will whirl your head round, but overall it's not a patch on the original.<br />The base tones seem to have disappeared altogether (maybe somebody forgot to include that track)! Although I am a great fan of DTS, my advice is save you money and stick with the original version.
0452282152|5.0|This is a sumptious tale of young girl who was forced by family circumstances to work as a wash up maid in the household of a reclusive perfectionist artist. We are captured by the rich detail and superbly wrought characters in this marvelous 17th century setting in Holland. A fantastic journey full of emotion and adventure touched by the hint of eroticism. Great for the coming cold weather and snuggling up with an occaisional GODIVA chocolate !!! I'm going to read it again.
0451196716|5.0|Of all the Stephen King books I have read, The Long Walk sticks out in my mind as the most intense and gripping of all his tales!<br />The story is about #47, Ray Garraty, the only participant from Maine in an intense marathon known as The Long Walk.  100 young men are chosen to compete against each other for a chance at $1 Billion and anything in the world!  During the race, Ray meets several other contestants including the mysterious Stebbins who becomes a major part of the story.<br /> With real characters and great storytelling, The Long Walk is great piece worthy of all your attention!  Hail to the King!!!
0345448898|5.0|My only comment for it is<br />&quot;The first book I ever cried for... hoping not to read the ending...&quot;<br />And for Philip Pullman. He was the best story-teller ever...<BR>He pulled my dream out to the visibility of the truly best writer.<br />And I owe British Council the greatest thanks of my timeless life. These 3 books would never have come to my hand if I didn't find the first book in this trilogy at the British Council's library.<br />Please pass this on to anybody who love reading the story fulfilled with unlimited fantasy based on the quantum physics theory and the colorful fondness, and the perfect plot living by the trustfully strong, spiritual characters in the story ever written in the human history
006097625X|5.0|Comic author and artist Scott McCloud's crusade to make comics respectable apparently annoys the living hell out of a lot of other comic authors and artists, as well as many fans.<br />To heck with 'em! I'm pretty much convinced that McCloud knows what of which he draws, but even if this dazzling analysis of past, present, and potential future of comics is balderdash, it's wonderfully entertaining and persuasive balderdash that's a wonderful read in its own right.<br />I especially recommend this if you _don't like_ comics or think they're beneath you. That largely described me! I can't say that it converted me into a fan who hangs around shops waiting for tne new issue of ___ to come in, but since reading _Understanding Comics_ I'm open to the idea that there's Something There.<br />Read this in chunks; the 'memetic load' is something fearsome and taking in more than a chapter at a sitting is asking for serious brain hurt.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card should truly be commended on his fabulous job of successfully capturing the perfect science fiction novel.  Without knowing it, Card sets the reader up early in the novel by telling the reader that &quot;lies were more dependable than the truth.&quot;  Indeed, this quote is true in the novel.  Card uses vivid descriptions of the futuristic setting in order to give the reader a true sense of where the story takes place.  In addition, Card describes the main character gracefully and the events and obstacles that he must overcome in great detail.  While reading the novel, it seems that Card is extremely predictable.  But in the end, he completes a three-hundred and sixty-degree turn, and catches the reader off guard.  The twist in the end is truly what makes the novel a complete success.  I would definately recommend this novel to all science-fiction lovers and all non-science-fiction lovers alike.  No matter what genre you enjoy, this novel is a must read.
0380789019|4.0|i loved this book. i couldn't put it down. it drew me in, and i got attatched to the characters; door, hunter, richard. Neil made you feel like there really WAS a london below. there should be a sequel, after the ending, i want to know what happens to richard and door's sister! all in all, this is an excellent book.
0393312836|5.0|This book, though looked at by some as impossible to read and looked at by others as glorifying violence, really does have a point:  a person can change.  While the movie and the original American version of the book don't have this redeeming quality, this new version does, mostly because of the inclusion of a new chapter that should have been included in the movie and original American version of the book.  Those who say that this book isn't thought-provoking don't know what they're talking about.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has the patience to work through the very difficult dialogue.  Even after having read greats like Shakespeare and Dostoevsky, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is even harder to read, but like the works of the great authors I mentioned above, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; has a greater point than it seems on the surface.  Read this book with an open mind and your opinion will definitely be changed.
B0000065O1|5.0|This is the only complete fitness tape that focuses on each muscle group - it is an excellent leg, abs, and upper body workout. <BR> You really feel your body participating. The fast pace provides both a good cardio and a weight training session. It was interesting to diversify well know routines with exotic Asian style kicks. Although you might not see results on the scales the first few weeks, your muscles definitely get toned and you feel more energized. If you do the tapes about 3 times a week for at least a month, I can guarantee you a decrease in your body size. I wish she releases it on a DVD so one can select workout sections and use it also as a target workout.
B00003CX9E|3.0|&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is all right, but it's nothing to write home about.  And it's definitely NOT the best American film ever made, according to AFI.  I would nominate Lumet's &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night,&quot; Nichols' &quot;The Graduate,&quot; Allen's &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; Spielberg's &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; and a host of others.  The narrative structure of &quot;Kane&quot; reminded me of Faulkner's &quot;As I Lay Dying.&quot;  Here you have a dead character, who goes by the name of Kane.  The people who knew him talk about what kind of an impact he had on their lives.  I didn't mind this structure in &quot;Dying&quot; because I liked the Addie character--who is like the Kane character.  The main problem I had with &quot;Kane&quot; is that I didn't care about the Kane character.  I did not find him very well developed at all--unlike the brilliant characters in &quot;Long Day's Journey,&quot; &quot;The Graduate,&quot; &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; and &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  So the Kane character was seeking the love that he lost as a child throughtout his life.  Big deal.  And that's why this film is considered a classic?  Fancy directing and camera angles do NOT make a masterpiece.  It all comes down to the writing.
0811828697|5.0|There isn't much bad I can say about this book. It's great to see the wonderful illustrations of some of the most talked about (and never seen) creatures of Star Wars.<br /><br />The artwork is top notch all around with loads of new beasties from the places you know in the Star Wars universe. The book is rather large for a \\"field guide\\". I know I wouldn't be throwing this in my backpack, but the (what I'm assuming to be) dewback hide cover of the book is great. And the comparative size chart on the inside covers is great. Yep, that's a Space Slug taking up all four inside covers...<br /><br />Overall, if you have any interest in the creatures of SW, this book will not disappoint. Looking at it, you can tell why it's retailing for $.... It is, just simply, an outstanding book.
B0000524CY|4.0|I think that this movie is very powerful but somewhat unrealistic!  I'm 12 and I regret watching it.  I also think the fact that the movie was based on a true story, it made the story more scary.  I thinnk the thing that made me most scared was how the girl looked as she began to rot. I didn't really like all the violence. But over all I think it was welll made, especially if you like scary movies!!
B00005N5S5|4.0|I can't say anything more about the film than has already been said. It is great fun. The DVD while good suffers from the lack of director commentary track. Considering the &quot;guerilla movie making&quot; involved, this would have been a wonderful opportunity to gain insight into the making of this film. Though the dual documentaries offers some insight, I would have welcomed Cameron providing intimate details of making this film. Otherwise, the sound and video quality are very high.
B000005IRG|5.0|This is an album of wonderful songs, with cryptic but beautiful lyrics, elegantly raw production, quirky but effective vocals--but most of all it is an amazing ensemble performance by two guitarists that apparently don't get along all that well personally, but make wonderful music together despite themselves.  It's difficult to explain the alchemical interplay these two guitarists have together--not only the way that Richard Lloyd's fluid melodicism complements Tom Verlaine's raw emotionalism, but the intuitive way in which each provides rhythm support for the other's lead explorations.  I can't think of two guitarists in all of rock music that play off of each other so well, and the rhythm section is likewise solid and sympathetic.  The guitar interplay is comparably strong on Television' eponymous 1992 reunion album, but the songs and singing are stronger here.  Buy it.
1573226521|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME BOOK. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIST THE URGE TO STRAP ON A PACK AND TRAVEL TO FAR AWAY PLACES. AN EXCITING WORK OF FICTION WITH PLENTY OF TWIST AND TURNS. I WOOD RECOMENDED IT TO ANYONE. EVEN IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE(WHICH WAS ALSO GOOD) THIS BOOK IS TEN TIMES BETTER.
B00000JR2A|5.0|Tears For Fears took a daring new turn in their sound with this one and realyy pulled it off. While the Big Chair was a heavily synth laden record this one fuses blues, jazz, rock, and soul to create the most colorful masterpiece I,ve ever heard. There hasen't been a better moment in music than late 1989. This edition I,m reviewing is the remastered with four bonus tracks. <br />Heres my review for each song starting with the first eight tracks...<br />Woman In Chains is a breathtaking power ballad with Oleta Adams on guest vocals. Her voice is unbelievable. This is one of the most soul grabbing song TFF have ever done. Badmans Song is a rock Blues driven song with lots of hammond organs with cool drums and Oleta Adams as guest vocal. This song is eight minutes and a half minutes long. Sowing The Seeds Of Love is similar to Badmans Song but more pop sounding than the previous one. It has cool trumpets laced with cool guiters. Unfortunately this is the only song to feature Curt Smiths excellent voice on this entire record. This was the big hit off this album. Advice For The Young At Heart is my favorite song on this CD. It is a very soul driven song with very powerful lyrics that will grab your soul. The ambient rock bridge in the middle is breathtaking. I almost cried with joy listening to this song. I love the echoing piano at the ending. Standing On The Corner Of The Third World is a haunting song with some Arab horns at the biginning and ambient organs. It becomes an almost gospel like song in the middle. The last minute features harmonica playing. The song speed up in the last 20 seconds and the fades out. Sword And Knives is a cool song with blips at the biginnings and ending. It then becomes a jazzy rock song and then becomes a hard driven rock song at the middle. Year Of The Knife is a great song with fast paced drums and rocking guitars. It begins with a crowd cheering. This song is great. Famous Last Words is a beautiful song that begins with a siren and piano for the first minute and a half. It then becomes an orchestra sounding song for the next minute. At 2:24 it blows up to become a power ballad with breathtaking lyrics that will reach your soul. It then slows back down and the siren sound effects kick back then fades out. This is a great closer to the orgininal version of this album.<br />And now on to the bonus tracks.......<br />Tears Roll Down is the primitive version of Laid So Low from the 1992 Greatest Hits but darker and less rock sounding. It builds up over the first two minutes with chanting and triangle sound clicks. It then blows up to become an ambient rock sounding song for about thirty seconds and then quiets back down and fades out. Always In The Past is a fast paced song that could,ve made it one this album. It has horns playing throughout the song. I love the ambient rock bridge in the middle of the song. Music For Tables is a smooth jazz instrumental. It's very nice and laid back and doesn't appear on the Saturnine Martial Lunatic CD. Johnny Panic &amp; The Bible Of Dreams is a song that has the chord structure of Shout but with hip-hop beats and the lyrics of Sowing The Seeds Of Love sung is a rap chorus in a great way. This version is more edgy and less DJ oriented than the version on the Saturnine Martial Lunatic CD. A cool closer to this masterpiece.<br />This is the best pop album I,ve ever heard in my life. It's the fun music that I miss so much in music these days. But whatever the future brings in music this album will definately hold up to the tests of time. In fact it doesn't sound dated at all and sounds more up to date than any of the antiquated rap/r&amp;b garbage on the radio these days. Go and buy this CD. It's worth the price you'd pay. <br />Over and Out...
B00005OAIE|5.0|When average, normal musician, John Mayer first set out to make music, he used one of the most astounding teachers in the world of guitar to shape his influence. A deep admiration of the late Stevie Ray Vaughan led Mayer to pick up a guitar and commence his career as a blues guitarist in many low-key bars.<BR>What Mayer soon discovered was that emulating his idol could never compare with the satisfaction of creating something new from within himself. After dead-end gigs and a lack of direction, Mayer stepped from the shadows of the artists who had shaped his musical spectrum, and traded in his electric guitar for an acoustic to begin making music of his own.<BR>With a voice comparable to Dave Matthews and the acoustic-pop styling of popular groups such as the Goo Goo Dolls and Toad the Wet Sprocket, Mayer steps from the box with a formula ready to please fans. Combined with his bluesy-electric fills, his new album, Room for Squares is filled with a sound refreshingly new to the music industry.<BR>Lyrically the album seeks to cover various grounds.  From the apologetic \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" to the adoration of \\"Your Body is a Wonderland,\\" Mayer both shows his respect and utter admiration of the women in his life. Aside from the usual woman-worship lyrics found in acoustic balladeers such as the previously mentioned Matthews, Mayer turns to impressive lyrics to show his amazement in the female form.<BR>\\"She's always buzzin' just like neon/Who knows how long she'll go before she burns out,\\" sings Mayer in a hip and funky \\"Neon\\" which appears as track five. Fear not however, not every track is laden with a smitten and shameful blabbering for some ex-girlfriend.  The album opener, \\"No Such Thing\\" confronts Mayer's sense of being in the \\"out crowd\\" in high school. Although he may not have been the most popular, he sings of happily returning ten years down the road to his high school reunion to show the crowd that sometimes learning doesn't always occur in the halls of educational institutions.<BR>The album is somewhat mellow and soothing and definitely not something geared toward the MTV TRL crowd. However, this album would most likely receive decent airplay on M2 or even VH1 as a featured artist.  The amount of talent in both the song-writing and musical talent should be quite evident to those familiar with his work. In essence, Mayer's goal is to take a genre and expand upon it to create a newer, refined version of a work that obvious had quite a bit of influence on him.<BR>Take it or leave it, Mayer no doubt has the ability and talent to gather a wide fan base and captivate them with his unique sound. Maybe he isn't the first to offer his work to the acoustic-pop world, but certainly he makes no difficulty blazing new trails.<br />The Bottom Line: A combination of acoustic styling and electric blues propels John Mayer's Room for Squares above some of the hum-drum one hit wonders available
B00003CXN4|5.0|I loved it.  My girlfriend loved it.  But I like Chompsky.  And I don't like the drug war very much, because I think it is, well, short sighted.<br />What else can I say.  If you know who that is, and you have an opinion about the drug war (either way!), you should see this movie.
B000002J1B|3.0|Relayer finds Yes trying to recapture the brilliance of Close To The Edge, by creating an album with three songs and similar song structures.  They do a decent job with the album, but it isn't vintage Yes.  New keyboardist Patrick Moraz does a fine job, in fact he is a highlight of the album, but the rest of the band, especially Jon Anderson, seems to be going through the motions.  Mr. Moraz only played on this album with the band before joining the Moody Blues.  Relayer was another top ten hit for the band, peaking at number five, but was a disappointment creatively.
B00000G3PA|3.0|This being a Bruce Willis comebacker movie, obviously makes a hero out of him.  Well, a group of oil drillers being chosen to save the world is quite impossible &amp; the circumstances that followed were quite unbelievable, but the film &amp; its set had its fine moments.  The drillers were funny at times &amp; of course, the brewing romance between Bruce's daughter &amp; his drilling colleague adds a little spark.  They try to make it a tearjerker at the end by making the great father/hero of the world sacrifice his own life to (1) save the earth &amp; (2) be a martyr &amp; take the place of Ben Afleck who was supposed to be the one to press the stuck button &amp; die on the surface of the meteor.  Hhhmmm, again, there's the Hollywoodish commercialism head leering again giving the viewers a blow in their common sense.  Anyway, it's entertaining just the same.  Oh &amp; yeah, great soundtrack.<br />If you want a more serious version of this similar theme, stick to Deep Impact.
B000002J1Y|5.0|When it was originally released in 1973, Yessongs was a sprawling three record set that typified the classic 70's excess that many bands partook in.  Despite the excess, Yessongs is a tremendous live album that captures the essence of the band.  Yes has always been influenced by classical music and they show it by opening up the album with a piece from Stravinsky.  The album has the arena staples of the drum, guitar and keyboard solos, but the band reels them in a bit and they don't become plodding and boring. The first disk's highlights include a stirring version of &quot;And You &amp; I&quot;, &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot; and Rick Wakeman's work on his solo effort &quot;Six Wives Of Henry VIII&quot; is compelling.  Disk two is tremendous from beginning to end and the band sounds as tight as they even have especially on &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; and &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;.  The cd also contains some of Roger Dean's coolest work, but unfortunately it doesn't translate as well into the cd booklet.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I have seen this movie twice &amp; I still find it mesmerizing.  Those who prefer lighter plot &amp; entertainment will be disappointed for this film is highly historical &amp; quite long, but very interesting for those who could truly appreciate this great man's deeds.<br />Through him, we have seen that nonviolence non-ccoperation can still succeed in the midst of prejudice &amp; oppression.  It may take time but it is worth the wait.<br />I just hope that all his efforts &amp; sacrifices have not been put to vain.  In a chaotic world we all live in, we need more of Gandhi in our midst.
B000002J1I|4.0|1978's Tormato was the last album to feature the classic Yes lineup and it is a solid collection of songs.  Gone are the sprawling double digit minute songs, but the prog-rock spirit lives on in such bizarre songs as \\"Arriving UFO\\", \\"Circus Of Heaven\\" and \\"On The Silver Wings Of Freedom\\".  \\"Don't Kill The Whale\\" is one the band's all-time greatest hits and doesn't get enough attention.  Tormato isn't vintage Yes, but an enjoyable album none the less.
6305232660|4.0|Contrary to its end-of-the-world contemporary film, Armageddon, Deep Impact is more realistic.  In this film, no single individual emerges as a lead character or hero who saves the earth.  All these great actors/actresses were given bits &amp; pieces roles &amp; they all have their own side stories.  This set-up may not work in other films, but in this particular one, it was successful in enhancing each character &amp; the role they play.  It is also more serious, heartwarming &amp; sensitive.  &amp; definitely, your eyes will not remain dry at the end of this film.
B000002J23|2.0|Of all the things that make up the Yes sound, the sprawling epics, the heavy keyboards and the like, the most distinctive element is the voice of lead singer Jon Anderson.  His high-pitched, chirpy sound perfectly brought to life the trippy, pixish lyrics he wrote.  For 1980's Drama he was replaced by Buggles lead singer Trevor Horn.  In fact the other member of the Buggles, keyboardist Geoff Downes joined as well.  While the highlight of the album is the superb keyboard work from Mr. Downes, its determent is Mr. Horn's vocals.  All too often he tries to mimic Mr. Anderson and he comes off as a bad imitation.  There only a couple of good songs and they are the industrial sounding &quot;Into The Lens&quot; and the unwielding &quot;Machine Messiah
B00005JH9W|5.0|The circus sideshow was an American phenomenon for decades, satisfying the public's need to be scared, disgusted, and left in disbelief. Attractions were more and more preposterous, but many of the performers in &quot;Freaks&quot; were memories of sideshows past. Sideshows were one of the few options for the severly deformed, a chance to make money while developing &quot;family&quot; ties with other sideshow performers. Politically correct it was not, but it was an alternative to life in an instititution.<br />TLC did a two-hour program called &quot;Sideshow&quot; narrated by Jason Alexander that chronicles the history of sideshows in the United States. There is footage of &quot;Freaks&quot; that is discussed as well as interviews with many surviving sideshow attractions such as Jeanie the Half Girl.<br />&quot;Freaks&quot; was made by Dracula director Tod Browning on a seemingly low budget. The electrical equipment on the set was so badly grounded that crew members were frequently shocked. Here are several interesting trivia tidbits surrounding the film: the film's original ending showed Hercules singing soprano in Madame Tetralini's new sideshow, but due to intense test audience reactions this scene was cut. Randion, the man with no arms or legs, developed a habit of lurking in dark corners and frightening passers-by with a blood-curdling yell. And during filming, the director was plagued with dreams in which Johnny Eck and a pinhead would keep bringing a cow in backward through a doorway in the middle of shoots.<br />This film was so disturbing to the public that it was banned in Britain for thirty years. It went under alternate titles including &quot;Forbidden Love,&quot; &quot;The Monster Show,&quot; and &quot;Nature's Mistakes.&quot; The &quot;freaks&quot; are still just as unsettling as they must have been to the sideshow and film public in 1932: a Half-Woman Half Man, a Half Boy, The Living Human Skeleton, The Bearded Lady, the Bird Girl, the Living Torso, the Armless Wonder, Pinheads, a Bird Girl and a Turtle Girl. Some are obviously mentally impared (pinheads and the bird girl)and their uninhibited bizzare performances are even scarier than the other acts.<br />&quot;Freaks&quot; still gives me the chills years after the first time I saw it. It is a testament to mankind's everlasting attraction to the bizarre, the scream-inducing, and the macabre. It is a remembrance of the once-booming sideshow business with its ragtag collection of &quot;human oddities.&quot; And it's a pretty creepy horror film as well. I wouldn't recommend this to young children...it is not gory or violent but the images ARE disturbing even to me. But's it's a great Halloween film and an interesting piece of circus history captured for all to experience decades after its decline. Watch it in the dark....he Armless Wonder, Pinheads, a Bird Girl and a Turtle Girl.

B000002J1H|5.0|1977's Going For The One was the band's first new release in three years and found keyboardist Rick Wakeman returning to the fold.  The album opens with the tremendous title track that sets the album off on the right foot.  &quot;Parallels&quot; is a hyped-up effort with the band showing alot of energy.  &quot;Wondrous Stories&quot; has a folky, pixie-like quality to it and Jon Anderson is top form.  The album closes with a classic Yes effort, the ambitious epic &quot;Awaken&quot; which harkens back to the days of &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot; and &quot;And You &amp; I&quot;.  Going For The One was the last truly great pro-rock album from the band.
014028009X|5.0|I loved this book.It is well-written and makes you think that it is good to be a woman, even if you have no boyfriend.It is a perfect read for women,and there is laugh in every page.It describes the life of a woman who's trying to find a boyfriend,with her &quot;crazy&quot; mother and her best friends.It shows the race she does to make the man she likes notice her and also her attempts to lose weight and sto smoking so much and drinking so much alkohol.But all that are not easy.All the men she knows are either married or gay;her mother bothers her with many crazy ideas and her father wanrs help.And it is not so easy to live in London when you are at that age and not married.And it's not easy to find a boyfriend when you follow your friend's advice.It is a grat book to read any time, and it makes you feel better and laugh,no matter how difficult times you have.

B000005RTG|4.0|Deep Purple soldiered on after the exit of the legendary Ritchie Blackmore in 1975 by adding American guitar hero Tommy Bolin for their last album of the '70's. \\"Taste\\" is a solid record which shows that the Purples weren't going to go away quietly. The funk of `Stormbringer' that didn't work somehow works here (\\"I Need Love\\" being a notable example). Bolin brought a unique jazz style to heavy rock and injected some much needed enthusiasm into the proceedings. His writing collaborations with Coverdale and Hughes provided such memorable tunes as \\"Getting Tighter\\", \\"Dealer, \\"Love Child\\" and my personal favorite \\"Lady Luck\\", with some classic vocals by Coverdale. This is an album that you like more after several listens although much of the second half is somewhat less exciting (\\"You Keep on Moving\\" is good but not a great closing song). Coverdale was in control of the band now as he desperately wanted Purple to continue. You might say the origins of the Whitesnake sound began with this 1975 release. Sadly the world would not here much more from Tommy Bolin as his personal demons got the better of him. What a waste! Anyway, accept the album title's invitation and enjoy!!
B00005N9CV|2.0|First off, I am a huge Diana fan, she has breathed new life into jazz singing and piano.<br />That said, what the heck happened? On other discs, there may be a few songs I don't love, but I enjoy them as part of the disc. There is always one that sticks out like Frim Fram Sauce or Peel Me A Grape. One song that shows off Diana's talent and spunk.<br />My biggest problem with this album is that that song does not exist. I listened to it closely three times trying to find something I liked but came up empty handed. I thought that an album of slow songs would be good, but it isn't. Or at least not these songs. Linda Ronstadt's version of Round Midnight is slow, but it's a real tearjerker, you can feel the pain being sung and the arrangement is spectacular, which makes it beautiful. That is good slow. Diana, I don't mean to criticize, but what happened?<br />The CD has a wonderful look to it, the best yet, but it is as good as this album gets. I still look forward to her next album. I hope she doesn't fall into the same pattern of most artists, getting worse with age. Let's hear some spunkiness!
0385474547|5.0|The problem with most books dealing with contemporary issues is that they become dated when the issues are not contemporary anymore. Some become relics of the past, a quasi-documentation used only as references. There are those that are pulled out evey now and then to provide background to current events. And then there are the books that transcend dates and places, names and events. Things Fall Apart is one of those books, worthy to stand next to Tolstoy, Pasternak or Steinbeck; maybe not in scope and structure but much more so in volition. <br />That Achebe focused on an individual and his immediate environment instead on a whole nation or continent only gives these issues more humane dimensions, the personal drama reflecting the political arena. Without resorting to the rethorics of post-colonialist theories or even romantic sentimentality about a disappearing culture, Achebe showed how a community in complete state of equilibrium can be ruined by intrusions of foreign influences - culture, religion, politics -- no matter how &quot;nobly intended&quot;. That there was no explicit finger-pointing at the white men &quot;civilizing&quot; the community in this story even makes a more interesting reading. When is a culture left alone? When does a contact with another culture become an offensive intrusion? Who defines the might of one culture over another?<br />At the dawn of the new millennium, these questions may not be as relevant to Africa's recent struggle to define itself instead of fighting colonialists. But echoes of the issues in the book still resound in other corners of the globe, only that they are in less recognizable forms. One only hopes that the books serves as a constant warning instead being seen as a document that has already fallen apart.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I must say, as a home theater buff, that this DVD has set the mark for A/V excellence.  I am overwhelmed by the audio portion of this DVD especially.  My home theater system has never had such depth and 3D clarity in any other movie so far.  The 5.1 EX surround on the DVD provides the most realistic sound field I have ever experienced.  I would give this movie 5 stars even if it was only the sound track and no associated video.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This movie ain't as good as the ESB or ROTJ, but in my blasphemous opinion, its better than A new hope.  Simply because the original star wars special effects were so horrible that it was funny.  In my book, special effects come before story in star wars movies, and the special effects in A new hope look like they cost 1.50 plus some stolen cardboard.  At least by ESB and ROTJ, the special effects were believable.<BR>   Back to phantom menace, the story was average and all the other usual complaints, but the most important thing was that I was entertained.  Even if you hate it, you will still buy this DVD, because George Lucas owns us all.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Reading all the print hoopla about Diana Krall makes me wonder if I missed something as I listened to her new CD, \\"The Look of Love.\\"  Maybe that sounds harsh, but I'm sorry to say I don't see what the big deal is.  Sure, these are all great jazz standards, \\"torch songs\\" I guess they call them, but there is nothing spectacular or terribly original about her renditions.  Nor can I say anything spectacular or original about her band.  The arrangements are nice, but applied to music, \\"nice\\" is a lukewarm term at best.<br />  This CD is my first exposure to Krall's music and I'm quite unimpressed.  The girl has absolutely no range in her voice; is this a trend after too many years of Anita Baker and other singers who are up one scale and down the next?  Krall's voice is sufficient, but there's nothing there that would make me tell anyone \\"you have GOT to hear this singer!\\"<br />  Don't pay full price for this CD.  I wish I hadn't.  Perhaps she generates more excitement during a live performance, but I'd say if you're looking to drop a few dollars on a female jazz vocalist, go for Ella.  Or even Annie Lennox, for that matter.
B000000NN4|5.0|Comparing this work with Heaven and Hell (released just a few months before Albedo 0.39) it shows Vangelis' jazzier side. Especially the rather wild and capracious &quot;Main Sequence&quot; reveals there is NO main sequence whatsoever! Alpha is ballad-like. Pulstar is pure synth-pop of surprising quality considering the 70's synthesizers.<BR>Nucleogenesis 1 and 2 are remarkable compositions which seem to combine classical and jazz composition with the best of the analog synth sound and lots of electic organs.<BR>Finally, there are a few early-New Age pieces here: the title track, Freefall, Mare Tranquilitatis and Sword of Orion.<BR>Therefore: a very diverse album with lots of surprises.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|If I could give this movie more than 5 stars.....believe me, I would. It's truly incredible, like nothing you've ever seen before - but in a good way!<br />Not being a huge Nicole Kidman fan, her performance really surprised me. And Ewan Mcgregor....well what can I say? He blew me away. He is definitely one of the most talented and versatile actors around at the moment. To top it all off, he can sing AND he's completely gorgeous!<br />Anyone out there who hasn't yet seen this film - GO AND SEE IT! Any reservations you may have about it will completely disappear....trust me!!<br />And the Oscar goes to........MOULIN ROUGE!!!
6305041156|5.0|Ran is the history of the Shakespeare's King Lear, but here the daughters of Lear are Sons, three samurais. Most of the power of the film besides on the combination of the Isabelline theathre with the Kabuki, the traditional Japanese theater. The movie has an extraordinary rithm, and the tragedy runs for itself. As all the Kurosawa's movies, this talks about the war and the dehumanization of the people. Is a great history, maybe the kurosawa's best.
B00000BKE1|4.0|Actually 3 1/2 to 4 stars. So it isn't among Maiden's best. But it isn't their worst either. While there are a few throwaway tracks, Afraid to Shoot Strangers, Wasting Love (poignant!), The Apparition, and Chains of Misery have spun in my player many times, and I have not tired of them. Weekend Warrior and the title track are also of note. Not up there with Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, etc, but a worthy addition to any diehard Maidenhead's collection. Cool album pictures too.
B0000029J5|5.0|Keb Mo's original lyrics, passionate &amp; articulate vocals and his simple blend of acoustic guitar blues &amp; folk make this an excellent debut album.  His blues are far from dysphoric as his guitar, harmonica and banjo playing will have you stomping your feet, snapping  your fingers and singing along.<br />In addition to Keb Mo's original songs, the CD also include his versions of Robert Johnson's &quot;Come on in My Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Kindhearted Woman Blues&quot;.

B00005OM4Q|4.0|Almost Famous reaches out to anyone who has ever been caught between the expectations of normalcy and experiencing the extraordinary.  William, the main character, struggles with the pressure from his mother to be a &quot;person of substance&quot; in the real world. Yet, he also wants to be part of the rock and roll lifestyle on the road with Stillwater.  The emphasis on the real world is just a personal construction that changes every day.  More people may accept a certain way of life as reality, but others create their own unique reality.  For William's mother it is education and success; for Penny Lane it is living in the moment with rock stars.<BR>Stillwater adopts William as part of their family.  William is working as a journalist for Rolling Stone is referred to as the &quot;enemy&quot;.  To the band, he is the enemy because his reflections of them can shape how the rest of the world views them personally and their music.  It is his job to report his observations, not present the band how they want to be seen.  As William befriends the band, he realizes it is hard to be honest but concludes that honesty is true friendship.<BR>For William, life on the road is different than life at home.  On the road, there is no routine, everything changes from city to city. He is part of the group instead of an outcast, as he is at school.  While he is out of his element he does expereince life on the road.<BR>The movie left me wondering what it was like for Stillwater and the band aids after the party was over.  Where do you go after reaching out to so many people and then fade away from the spotlight?  It is also interesting whether or not the experience changed William.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Like many music fans i have heard much buzz about a new york band called the strokes.  Since middle July it seems that eveyr magazine was heralding themt he saviors of rock and the first big thing of the new millenium...and after months of waiting and two weeks due to repackaging...i bought the album without hearing any of the tracks before hand...and i can honestly say i hated it...<br />Punk is dead...it hasn't been good since Rocket To Ruin by The Ramones i put the cd down and didn't listen to it...and then one day i woke up and the song &quot;someday&quot; was buzzing in my head. So like any good music lover i put the album back in...and let me tell you i loved it...each listen it grew on me more...the shotty production and no lyrics in cd didn't bother me anymore...it was like a time machine...bringing me back to a time when music wasn't commercial and when music actually said something...this was the album i had been waiting for...this was the album that lived up to the hype...this is one of the top five releases of the year...i was ecstatic loving it...i was in awe...I now must tell people buy it, you will love it and it will grow on you...trust me...this is it...now that ending sounded corny.

1878424319|5.0|So many &quot;self-help&quot; books are pure rhetorical tripe. Common sense, good manners, and sensible actions regurgitated. In &quot;The Four Agreements,&quot; Ruiz does not break new ground but the simplistic and thoughtful nature of his message make this book a winner. <br />Let's face it, experience and iteration (practice) will propel one toward their stated goals with certainty. To point, the four agreements, as simple as they may be, are tantamount to successful achievement of personal and/or professional goals:<br />1) Be impeccable with your word - keep your word or your reputation will fail.<BR>2) Don't take anything personally - tough act to muster at times but possible (besides, its good for the soul).<BR>3) Don't make assumptions - those who assume will lose the benefit of fact and learning; check your facts--learn what is necessary.<BR>4) Always do your best - this is the most simplistic of the agreements but one that we all have a tendency, at one time or another, to allow to lapse; if you decide to undertake something, make it YOURS!<br />So many people who read books such as this or &quot;Who Moved My Cheese&quot; (self-help genre) attempt to pick apart the conceptual nature of the message whether simple or complex. Certainly, many books of this ilk are not worth the paper they're written on but when you find a message that speaks to your intellectual being as well as your soul, you'd better listen. Riuz's message is poignant; follow these simple rules and create your own happiness. <br />This isn't a &quot;cure-all&quot; book. If you read it without concurrent introspection, then you've done nothing more than read a short book espousing basic vitues. However, if one reads this book with an open mind and the congruous search for excellence, this will be a truly powerful experience. If one does not, then one has lost the message behind the words. Don't read the WORDS, absorb the MESSAGE!<br />Jump in, both feet. You'll not be sorry.
B00003CX5P|5.0|No matter what your opinion of the movie, this DVD is top notch.  I wasn't going to write a review but I noticed that many of the reviews here were gripes about the movie itself or gripes about the lack of DTS, etc.  Some reviewers hadn't even viewed or listened to the DVD yet!  Well, my answer is this: this DVD will make a &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; fan out of you.  It is, by far, the best DVD in my collection.  The audio, even lacking DTS, is reference quality.  Get your 5.1 HT setup cranked up and watch the lightsaber battle and you will not, repeat WILL NOT, believe your ears.  I am a big fan of DTS (even to the point of buying DTS DVDs over the more extra-filled non-DTS version), but believe me when I say that you cannot tell that this track is non-DTS.  Its is that good!  In fact, this audio track is better than ANY DTS disc (better than Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan!)<br />And man, the extras are unreal!  The documentary is alone worth the price of the disc.  Its is the best documentary I have seen on disc (only the &quot;Hamster Factor&quot; from 12 Monkeys is even close).  <br />In fact, I think this disc is so good that even if you were less than happy with the movie, you will be pleased with your purchase.
0671042858|4.0|OK<br />lets get started, and one, and two, and one, and two, and reach, and three, and four, and three, and four, and done.<br />OK<br />lets get started, this movie is quite macabre, and it smells as though a creature of mass proportions hath eateth it with bacon grease.  I liked the scene about the McDonalds hamburger that was planning to take over the underwater palace of Fruitopia :)<br />The descriptions of nectorine juice and cocoanut milk were almost as tasty as the anchovie/glub pizza i had for dinner!  I quote a friend when i say, &quot;Take my splean, take my guts, take my liver, and take my heart, just dont take my glazed ham.&quot;<br />You know, glazed ham goes swell with smoked turkey, and especialy smaller versions of the australian dingo drumsticks.  Along with large quantities of bile, the mammoth grunt attacks are over used and overwhelm the common grub.  Though many species of grub live in Wyoming there is a certain species that sucks blood.  It is called the centinino monkey blood sucking virus, and is identified by it large tick infested ear drums.  Thank you for your vital organs, they were delicious and i wish i had more time to spend with them, but i dont so, may the oil derrick be with you!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the baddest cd out! Every song (with the exception of #11)should be a #1 hit. The only negative thing I can say about the album is they should have saved some of their songs for the follow-up album. There's NO WAY they (or any band for that matter) can even come close to matching Hyrid Theory.
0553573411|4.0|On one hand following Fitz in this second volume of Hobb's trilogy is an exercise in genre.  We have the flawed and raised-from-the-common man-role hero with surprisingly strong magical talents, the political intrigue, the unknown ominous evil, the reclusive guide, the burly stable master, and the vaguely annoying love interest.  But any story can be reduced to a series of stereotypes--the key is how the author builds off these basic ingredients.<br />On the other hand we have a fully-drawn main character surrounded by a cast of supporting characters whose actions are believable and whose flaws and struggles somehow hit home.  Hobb has done a great job creating a background and historical framework within which her plot lines function.  Rather than launch into a plot summary I'll just state that the standard elements of a complex political intrigue-style fantasy series are all here and Hobb handles them adeptly.<br />The strongest elements are the fact that Fitz is never cloying as a hero--he struggles to do the right thing and sometimes acts irresponsibly / out of anger.  He's fun to accompany.  His wolf companion brings a nice \\"simple viewpoint of a guide\\" contrast to the \\"complex viewpoint from a mystical guide\\" supplied by Chade.  The one weak part is the ongoing and rather boring romance with Molly.  Fitz is kept incredibly busy by the events in the novel; his romance adds needlessly.  Whatever--the third volume will soon be read for the surely satisfying conclusion.
B00003CX5P|5.0|the dvd is great, full of deleted scenes includeing some in the final movie not seen in theatres or on vhs tapes, extra long pod race start, lap 2 of race, and a air taxi scene in corasunt are good scenes in the movie. all who love star wars need this dvd
0380002930|5.0|Adams strikes a wonderful balance between having a fully detailed and realized &quot;alternate&quot; world and creating characters whose playfulness and seriousness (when the plot requires) allow the reader to feel a closeness to them.  Highly recommended for anyone from about 10 and up.
6300213668|5.0|After years people still love Grease. Grease is about two highschool sweethearts who madley fall in love over summer vacation and then they meet at school. Those two are Sandy and Danny. Kind of rimes doesn't it. Anyways they fall in love but then they start to split up as the year goes by. Danny is the most popular guy in his senior grade while Sandy a brand new school for her is nerve wrecking. She hangs out with the pink ladies who date the most popular guys in school. Sandy is totally oppossite of the pink ladies because she is really charming and sweet but then in the end she changes her looks and her adittude to get Danny back. With Sandy and Danny hitting the Dance floor with lots of music you can't go wrong.
0800141601|2.0|The approach to this movie is an interesting one, for clearly the director tries to 'humanise' the entire Arthurian legend. Gone is Excalibur as a magical blade. Lancelot is a travelling loner, rather than having been sent by the Lady of the Lake. Merlin is nowhere to be seen, and there is no hint of magic or mysticism in sight. Many viewers will automatically be deterred by this approach.<br />This approach provides an interesting perspective on the movie - trying to get behind the true story upon which the Arthur legends are based. The idea is good, the execution lacking.<br />Geer provides a very modern portrayal of Lancelot. The American accent for an English hero was proven not to work by Costner in Robin Hood : prince of thieves. His portrayal of Lancelot is very contemporary which creates discord with the setting of the film. A classic approach was maintained by Ormond and Connery, and so Geer's portrayal goes against the grain.<br />The plot and villian are very run-of-the-mill in all regards. The only stand out features of this film are: Connery, Ormond and the cinematography. Connery and Ormond, and the lovely sweeping scenes of the lanscape, keep this film above a rating of 1. <br />While not a terrible film, it is mediocre at best.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is 35 minutes of fresh music that is breathtaking.  From beginning to end it is absolutely awesome.  Finally someone has figured out that the offbeat adds interest and texture to music.  The record has a garage feel to it throughout.  I think people are primed to hear something with some originality and feeling in it.  You absolutely must listen to this record.

0743216458|4.0|(I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN &quot;ORAL HISTORIES&quot;)<br />This book covers the combat history of the 101st Airborne, 506th's Easy Company. I WAS TOLD this book is an oral history and I READ other reviews confirming it. So I ordered it. (I would much rather have the vets tell their own story than a historian) However, despite the book discribed as an oral history it is not. With a oral history the vets themselves tell their story in their own words. Such books as &quot;DEATH MARCH&quot; by Donald Knox and &quot;BLACK DEVIL BRIGADE&quot; by Joseph Sprenger are excellent examples of true oral histories. (&quot;Black Devil Brigade&quot; is without a doubt the '2001 sleeper' of Airborne and Commando WWII combat and standard for oral histories .) <br />Notwithstanding the fact Band of Brothers is not a real oral history does not diminish Band of Brothers. Band of Brothers is very well written by Ambrose, is reasonably priced, and reads fast, fast, fast. <br />Anyone interested in Airborne operations of the Second World War, or any reader who is familiar with the works of Stephen E. Ambrose, should purchase this book. It's a terrific read covering the history of airborne combat, and their airborne spirit, and you will not be disappointed.
1853260169|4.0|Although this book is not about the two sisters of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the primary characters are two sisters (which will remind you of Jane and her sister), Elinor and Marianne Dashwood.  Again, as in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the underlying theme is marriage. There is a lot of misunderstanding due to partial, or erroneous, information.  The sense and sensibility is shown in how the sisters handle the different predicaments.<br />The cast includes, among others, the sisters, Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and John and Fanny Dashwood.<br />This edition has the complete text and not much else.  The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book.  There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult.  It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.<br />I do recommend this book.  The edition is worth the price, and the story is indeed a classic.

B00004XOWN|4.0|I have been a Limp Bizkit fan since their first album. I have to say although this album is very good I think &quot;significant other&quot; was much better. I love to see a band that can improve on their sound and songs from one album to the next but in this case I think they need to try a little harder.<br />This time around I found myself skipping at least 3 to 4 tracks because frankly they are just bad. Significant other still remains my favorite LB CD and it will be the one that all other LB CDs will be judged.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one family-oriented film that actually kept me awake.  I enjoyed watching it with the kids in the theater and plan to purchase the DVD immediately upon release.  The storyline was tight, the graphics were amazing, and there were numerous hilarious moments in the film.  Definitely a classic.
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones is definetely one of the best bands in the world, next to Metallica, Staind or Tool. Their latest release, White Pony, sets new grounds for the hardcore music, establishing a new sound mixing perfectly with Chino Moreno's amazing voice.<BR>Still i have to express my disappointment, because, just like many other bands, Deftones have the tendency to commercialize. After Adrenaline and Around The Fur, two incredibly hard albums, came this White Pony, which is much softer. <BR>But also wiser.<BR>This album is a collection of masterpieces, with Passenger on top of everything. An incredible song, full of amazing moments, marked by the vocals of James Maynard Keenan, the Tool singer. Also check out Teenager, one of the strangest, most thrilling ballads of the year. Should i say anything about Change? I guess you all already know it. <BR>But all the other songs are great too, so go check them out. This is a MUST for all the rockers out there.
0451191153|5.0|It took me a long freakin time to read this book, but it has really changed my life and stuff.  I now know that women, even if they are strong on the outside, like to fantasize about having themselves forced upon by rock quarry workers or similar blue-collar professions, like construction, or dog catching.  I feel like I've been WAY too nice to women.  Thanks, Ayn Rand!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I've heard a few of Lenny's songs here and there over the years but I've never really been a fan. GREATEST HITS is an awesome collection of rock/pop tracks. All of the songs have a classic rock feel to them. Lenny produced and wrote all of the songs and as a whole GREATEST HITS flows very well. Each song sounds timeless, classic, and great. When you listen to it you'll probably remember some of his songs and some will seem new to you. Some songs like &quot;can't get you off of my mind&quot; are very well done. I was plesantly surprised at how well Lenny Kravitz does on ballads like &quot;heaven help.&quot; GREATEST HITS includes the new track &quot;again&quot; which was already a hit. GREATEST HITS is an awesome collection of songs from Lenny.
B00005B4GU|5.0|entrancing album from tom and the oxford lads.like KID A it seizes your attention from first to last and you just cant take it off.ever so slightly more song orientated than KID A, the effect is mesmerising.

B00004X01U|3.0|When the single &quot;music&quot; was first released I thought it was a great piece of dance music. It was upbeat, fun, and sonically satisifying. The album MUSIC however is not so good. First, Madonna's voice is now a computer and every song tries way too hard to be electroic. MUSIC is a split between electronica, dance, and folk. The ballads &quot;i deserve it&quot; and &quot;gone&quot; show Madonna as never before, as a folk singer. She actually shows some emotion on those and &quot;what it feels like for a girl&quot; is nicely written and produced. As a whole, MUSIC lacks the emotion, excitement, and fun that a pop album should have. It is innovative and different but most of the songs don't flow. Duds like &quot;impressive instant&quot; and &quot;runaway lover&quot; try much too hard to impress. Aside from &quot;music&quot; and &quot;don't tell me&quot;, MUSIC fizzles out and is easily forgettable.

B00000JCB2|4.0|OK, I gotta be honest (avoids rotten veggies being thrown at him) This CD is REALLY good. Honestly. A lot of people hate it just because it's Limp Bizkit and just because it is the CD that propelled them to superstardom, but if you actually sit down and listen to it, it's a really well written, well produced album. The lyrics on this album are (for the most part) a lot more personal and more mature than a lot of the stuff on 3 Dollar Bill, even though one can't help but get annoyed by songs such as &quot;Just Like This&quot; and &quot;I'm Broke.&quot; Fred's singing is really good on here and shines on songs like &quot;Don't Go Off Wandering&quot; and &quot;Rearranged.&quot; Dj Lethal puts his skills to work on the undeniably catchy &quot;9 Teen 90 Nine&quot; which yes, despite it's numb lyrics, is an awesome track. Method Man makes an appearance on &quot;N2Gether Now&quot; which was funny maybe the first 3 times I heard it. &quot;Nookie,&quot; even though it was over-played, is actually a really good song, and seeing how it hasn't been on the radio for 2 years, I've had some time to recover. &quot;No Sex&quot; is also another standout, which features Aaron Lewis of Staind (Which I didn't even realize until last week).<br />Don't be afraid to like this album. It is REALLY good, especially for Limp Bizkit. I will even go on record by saying this is their best album, better than their first and WAY better than Chocolate Hot Dog Whatever. You may not respect them, but you can't deny how well this album is executed.
0694525499|5.0|I have to commute two and a half hours a day and audiobooks really help. This is by far the best one I've heard yet. The story is superbly written (the book edition has excellent reviews) and George Guidall is amazing in the reading of the book. I will probably buy more audiobooks just because of his excellent pace, pronunciation and character depictions. Read the book reviews for opinions on the story and if you like to make your commute disappear into thin air... buy this audiobook!
0780020685|5.0|This is a must have for samurai buffs and fans of Akira Kurusawa's films. It's refreshing to see a classic film from a director that inspired numerous of today's directors like Spielberg without all the flashiness and hipness of contemporary Hollywood movies.<br />The film quality is excellent and the commentary that comes with the movie is informative and entertaining. There aren't too many special features, other than subtitle selection and the commentary but it's a great DVD nonetheless.
B00005NQLP|4.0|I was very excited when I saw this album had finally been released on CD as I had long since worn out two copies of the LP.  When this album first came out it was in my car player for months.  It's is Nash's most personal album and deals with the early years of his marriage, the birth of his first child and his hopes for the future.  It is a window into a truly gentle soul who has the perfect voice to convey those feelings.  Musicanship is great with camos from Stills and Crosby.  The packaging is decent with full credits and lyrics provided.  Liner notes would have helped. The CD it self has excellent sound in a 24 bit remaster.  For the heftly price it would have been nice to get some bonus tracks.
B000059Z8J|5.0|No, I don't mean that \\"Superman\\" is a bad movie - on the contrary, it's brilliant.  I mean that the REASON it has held up so well is the trouble Richard Donner had to go through to complete it.<br /><br />\\"Superman\\" has all of the warning signs of a crappy big-budget bomb: multiple rewrites (and numerous writers), producer interference, eccentric actors, and special effect delays.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />Tom Mankiewicz, the \\"creative consultant\\" was able to pull off a believable script with snappy dialog and a reasonable suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Richard Donnner wisely chose believability over camp, a risky choice that helps \\"Superman\\" sustain itself 30 years later.<br /><br />Marlon Brando's behavioral (and payroll) quirks didn't end up consigning the film to the camp category, and helped redefine Jor-El (but his loss is disastrous for the original \\"Superman II\\")<br /><br />John Williams created an iconic score recognizable where others are forgotten.<br /><br />The director's commentary with Richard and Tom outline the difficulties in pulling this film together.  The end result is a vision of \\"Superman\\" that went beyond the source material to a point where the movie's themes become intertwined with future print and film versions (i.e. the vision of Krypton as a cold, crystalline place).  Apparently the stress of pulling it together brought the production through the crucible to make a shining, iconic superhero film.<br /><br />I saw this in 1978, and again every few years and it gets better every time.
B000002IQW|5.0|I remeber it well, I was 9 years old and my mom was playing \\"Monkey Business\\" on the car stereo.  It blew my mind, and now ten years later it still does.<br />1. Monkey Business:  Great song!! Starts off with soft singing from Bach, but that all ends with a peircing scream!  Awesome!!<br />2. Slave To The Grind:  Very heavy and fast!  Baz proves that he can have a more \\"metal\\" voice on this song.  Hill, and Sabo add excellent guitar work to this memorable burner<br />3. The Treat:  Big chorus, but it's one of the album's weaker tracks in my opinion.  One of the only skipable songs, even though it's still good.<br />4. Quicksand Jesus: !! Read these lyrics.  This is Skid Rows best lyrical work ever and Baz' voice sounds beautiful.  The ending always baffles me;  how does he scream like that??<br />5. Livin' On A Chaingang:  Great lyrics and amazing vocals make this one of the best on the album.  Bolan has an impressive bass line chugging with Affuso's pounding drums.<br />6. Get The ... Out:  This is nothing more than a fun party song.  It should not be taken seriously.  It's fast, simple, and punkish in nature.  Good for when you have friends over.  Other than that, it's skipable.<br />7. Creepshow:  Another weaker song, but by no means bad.  The structure just never really appealed to me much.<br />8. Psycho Love:  This is fun one, but falls into the category of \\"The Threat\\" and \\"Creepshow\\".  This song is good, but not great like the majority of the album.<br />9. In A Darkened Room:  One of the most amazing balads ever.  I've never heard anyone sing like Sebastian does on this song. The creepy guitar tones adds to the epicness.  Great!<br />10. Riot Act: This is another simplistic song with a punk attitude.  This time, they pulled it off fantastically well.  This is one of the best on the album.<br />11. Mudkicker:  Ohhhhh, heavy!!!!<br />12. Wasted Time:  This is the best song on this album!! Absolutely beautiful!!
B00004XQP4|5.0|This IS a little lighter than what most Green Day fans like myself are used to(you can tell a poser by the fact that they say they love green day, and only know the songs on warning), but its still good.  As for everyone that complains about green day mellowing out, they dont pay much attention to music.  Look at Everclear.  Everything they did for awhile was relatively heavy for them, and then out came SOngs From An AMerican Movie Volume 1: Learning How To Smile(right along with being bashed by all the 'music fans'.  The if you stayed faithful to the music you bought volume two, which was ALOT heavier than its predicessor.  Which is exactly what Green Day is doing with warning.  And besides, I cant quit laughing at the first part of deadbeat holiday : wake up the house is on fire / and the cats caught in the dryer.....  absolutly great. the lyrics are pure green day.  And for the guy who didn't like &quot;Misery&quot;, its because he doensn't understand green day.  if you look beyond the band and into the members themselves, its totally natural.  5 stars for the kings of marching out of step.
B00005ATQG|4.0|From the moment Humbert Humbert (James Mason) sees Lolita (Sue Lyons) lounging on the grass in her backyard in bikini and sunglasses, he's befuddled. Ain't no way he's gonna pass up renting a room from Lolita's mom, Mrs. Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) now. So the emigre spends the summer mooning after the 13-year-old nymphette while holding off the advances of the amorous landlady, as author Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers) and his beatnik girlfriend make a big splash at the local dance.<br />I enjoyed &quot;Lolita&quot; immensely, much more than I thought I would, although I didn't expect the movie to take the plot twists it did, some of which are quite jarring.<br />Still, the actors are all first-rate. James Mason does a great job as Humbert, appropriately out of it for some scenes, conveying a certain nonconversance with the English language without feigning any sort of accent different from his own famous one. Sue Lyons does the bored teenager quite well, very naturalistic. The real startler, though, is Peter Sellers, whose American accent is right on the money, and who manages  to contrive several subcharacters within Clare Quilty. It's a pity, really, that he got so bogged down with Inspector Clousseau and didn't display the full range he might have more often.<br />Make a date soon to find out &quot;How did they ever make a movie out of Lolita?&quot; and see if you are as helpless as poor James Mason.
B00003CX5P|2.0|The first three Star Wars movies created a believable fictional universe, then filled it with complex, likable characters and a strong plot.<BR>This movie, supposedly based in the same fictional world, has fat CGI creatures that fly around on tiny wings, floppy, stretchy creatures with undersized joints and oversized appendages, and spacecraft that look as if you'd break a piece off if you bumped into them in a docking bay.  It's also got a little kid who can fly a space fighter better than the adult masters of the original movies.  AND he's got a magical luck surrounding him which deflects all harm and makes his enemies clumsy.  Don't forget the battle fought with ridiculous blue globs of goo.<BR>The special effects, with the exception of the blue globs, were on par with other modern sci-fi movies.  The plot was dismal.  Characters often did not make believable choices, and events bounced between confusing and illogical.<BR>Of course, Jar Jar topped it all off.  He projected no screen presence, and couldn't &quot;act&quot; worth a damn.  CGI is no excuse -- I've seen plenty of &quot;real&quot; animated characters.  And, of course, he is SO irritating I find myself grinding my teeth.  Unfortunately, he got a lot of screen time, often upstaging the far more enjoyable actors.  I give it two stars because although the movie was awful, the DVD did contain plenty of features.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|WOW, what an awful this movie was! Albeit, Angelina pulled through as foxy as ever .. the only reason to see this movie if you're a fan of hers.<br />The game has more compassion and feel than this movie. The characters are dull and quite honestly all expendable. The plot is far from evolved and the climax -- wait, no, there was no climax.<br />Three thumbs up for Angelina .. as for absolutely everything else in and about this movie, if you could hear a sound this is where'd I'd fart.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|Memento is an amusing way to spend ninety odd minutes, no more.  The gimmick is neatly handled, but ultimately turns out to be rather more obvious than I had anticipated.  This whole business of basing an entire film on one slim premise is getting rather tiresome.  First The Usual Suspects, then The Sixth Sense, then this.<br />If any of the characters had grown on me as human beings, I might have liked the film better.  As it is, it is a rather chilly exercise in style and narrative trickery.  Nothing more.
6305095442|4.0|This movie is a good movie.  It isn't scarry but is hilarious(in some parts).  This is my least favorite of the Evil Dead Series.  It just doesn't make any sense!  Watch the greatest horror film ever, Evil Dead, then watch Evil Dead 2 and tell me I'm not right!  The special effects were better, but the story was not near as good as ED 1.  The possesions weren't near as scarry.  But you should still see this movie.  Also, check out Army of Darkness.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Ok, I have had enough of the Jar Jar bashing to last a lifetime. Where were all of you when Jedi came out with those silly ewoks? Episode 1 in all intensive purposes is the first installment of a saga. In all other cases, the beginning isn't as good as the other movies in a saga. Take Star Trek The Motion Picture. I think that the main reason that most people didnt like the story of Phantom Menace is that they know the rest of the story. The climax of the saga is known. In every movie the beginning 30 minutes is used to establish characters.<br />Anyway, The DVD is the best package Iv'e ever seen. I have seen all that there is on it and I can't wait to get home and watch it again. If you are a Star Wars fan you can't pass this up.
B00005B36H|5.0|I can indefinitely say this is the most meaningful and thought out declaration of music I have heard in a long time. I bought this CD the day it came out and it easily remains a favorite. Lateralus is one of those recordings that requires a full run from start to finish to fully understand the message and feeling as each song intermingles with the next (sometimes literally by name). Honestly if you're looking for a quick hit CD like Aenima or Undertow, then this probably will make little sense to you. It mixes an even amount of soft, trance-like music with sudden rushes of loud hardcore jammin like only Tool can do while MJK either screams or harmonizes with the flowing music.
B000002UA7|5.0|If you have any cd of Kate's in your collection, or if you are converting albums or cassettes to cd, buy this one.  Because Kate Bush got very little commercial airplay other than Running up that Hill(which radio stations seem to have misplaced over the years or something)many of these songs might be new to you even though alternative radio stations played them for years.  Even though this album is called the Whole story she has had hits since.  It is an affordable cd to start your collection.  Personally I love Wuthering Heights(the first time I heard it back in the 80's it made me want to read the book-I like the song and movie better ha ha.)Cloud bursting and the Man with the Child in his eyes are awesome too.  There is actually not a dud on the album.  I just wish it included songs from her later albums especially &quot;The sensual world&quot; but other than that, no complaints.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I'm hoping that the sequel fills in the gaps that the first film had. The X-Men team was missing several key characters such as Beast,Gambit,Archangel,Morph,Iceman,Colossus,Nightcrawler and so on. Beast and Angel were part of the team way before Wolverine came into play. There were villains that were missing from Magneto's team as well such as Pyro,Juggernaut, and the Blob. Rumor has it that Arnold Shwartzeneger was supposed to play Colossus but backed out early. It'll be a miracle if the sequel meets my standards more than the first film.
6305949980|5.0|I like to watch movies. This movie was a good movie. I saw it when it was in theater form. I had candy then. Do you like candy? I sure do. I like to eat candy when I watch movies.  This movie was really good. Buy this movie.  Eat some candy.  Please give me candy.
6305132984|5.0|This was a great movie!  I saw it after I heard one of it's noturious songs &quot;America&quot;.  A great story of life for Puerto-Ricians in Manhattan.  I would recommend watching it with kids who understand racism and gangs, but otherwise it was a REALLY great movie!
014028009X|2.0|I bought the book because I enjoyed the movie.  I found the movie had a better storyline and to be much funnier.  In the movie, Bridget embodies every embarassing &amp; disheartening moment a woman has ever had - poor public speeches, big mommy girdle underwear, getting cheated on.  No one in real life has so many humiliating moments and you are glad she gets the good man in the end.  In the book, Bridget is supposed to be in her 30s but her life resembles that of a woman in her 20s.  By her 30s Bridget should have learned her lessons and started to get serious with her life.  First, she is a total drunk.  She should have outgrown her drunken sprees by her early 30s.  She doesn't take her job/career seriously and is always late.  Her apartment is a mess and she never has clean clothes. Her bank account hovers near 0.  She dates losers with whom she has no possible future and she handles her relationships in an adolescent way.  She is such a mess that I am shocked that sucessful men want anything to do with her.  The movie Bridget was much more likeable than the book Bridget.
0764113496|4.0|This book is a very useful tool for the beginning to intermediate student of Russian language.  It provides a lot of verbs and their full conjugations, which can often be confusing to students.<br />Every serious student should own this book.  However, once you advance in ability, you will notice a few shortcomings, such as questionable translations in a few cases.  The book also fails in some cases to provide a sufficient explanation of which case is to be used with the given verb in what kind of situation.  Still, this book is very useful and will greatly help the student of Russian to learn the typical conjugational patterns of the language.  I highly recommend this book to early students of the Russian language.
0790734060|5.0|Im taking serious thoughts to vote this film as the best film ever.....No im not someone who is watching a film once in a while...im studying in cinema critics...and ive already seen 438 films only in cinema theaters...so i guess my opinion can be rather helpfull for u people who r wondering rather this film worths it or not!
B000002HFU|4.0|THIS IS ODB'S FIRST SOLO COMING AND IT'S THE DIRTY VERSION. THIS IS HIS ENTER THE 36 CHAMBERS ALBUM. BASICALLY IT'S THE &quot;ENTER ODB'S WORLD&quot; ALBUM. ODB BRINGS YOU SOME HOT LYRICS(ODB STYLE OF COURSE. ONLY ODB CAN DO IT LIKE THIS)AND HOT BEATS. I LIKE THIS ALBUM A LOT. SOME PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND ODB BUT I DO SO I FEEL THIS ALBUM. IF YOU FELT HIM ON THE 36 ALBUM YOU SHOULD FEEL HIM ON THIS. SONGS LIKE &quot;BROOKLYN ZOO&quot;, &quot;PROTECT YOUR NECK 2 THE ZOO&quot; AND &quot;SNAKES&quot; YOU SHOULD LIKE. BASICALLY THE ALBUM IS HOT(ODB STYLE) AND YOU SHOULD COP IT. IF YOU A WU FAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS ALBUM ALREADY!!
B00004Z459|4.0|I borrowed this CD from a friend and basically, it's really good. The awesome vocals of the singer and the rapper, combined with great guitars, drums, and DJing, makes this a very tempting cd to buy. BUT, while the songs song great at first, after a couple days they seem to blend into eachother. linkin park perfected this art form, and while the sound is great at first, it quickly becomes boring. with the exception of 'in the end,' the best song on the cd, this cd will just collect dust on your shelf after a week
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I must have listened to the original version of this album everyday from the latter half of 1983 through 1986, and I never ever tired of it. I remember my cousin Miguel and I recording a session in 1983 where we sat down at his dining room table with my dual cassette &quot;ghetto-blaster&quot; in the center, listened to each track and reviewed the songs ala Siskel and Ebert. The only departure we had from those two famous critics was the fact that Miguel and I never gave any of the songs a thumbs-down, and this was well before Thriller became the biggest selling album of all time. I would give anything to find the tape we did now because our comments were miraculously prophetic! To now have Thriller remastered complete with bonus interviews from &quot;The Dude&quot; Quincy Jones and songwriting superman Rod Temperton and the extra songs, including a demo Michael did at home of Billie Jean is almost surreal. I will treasure this CD and look forward to wearing it out like I did my vinyl album and the three copies I've owned on cassette. Mark my words: This album will sell as well if not better than the original version. Michael Jackson and all the people associated with this groundbreaking piece of American history should be regarded as genuises. Buy the CD and hear the songs that you know like you've never heard them before; and the ones you've actually never heard before will whet your appetite for his upcoming offering &quot;Invincible.&quot;
B000002UZ1|3.0|There is a lot that can be said for the blue and red Beatles compilations;they do highlight the major songs from the periods they represent,and the running order is both listenable and chronological. I owned this on vinyl when it was first released in the early seventies. Having bought all the individual albums on CD,I was reluctant to shell out the cash for this disc (the price is needlessly hefty for a two CD set although they did a great job with the re-mastering and booklet,it's still not a box set which it almost costs as much as).I got mine from the public library and copied it;you could also just make your own compilation tape/CD-R/Mini-Disc,just like this(although the sound here I believe is a little better than the discs that were mastered in the 80's,and the Yellow Submarine Songtrack is mastered even better) if you own the individual albums on CD,which everyone should.
B00005Q4ED|4.0|I recall seeing the television program when I was a junior in high school.  The book was my all-time favorite at the time, and I felt that George C. Scott was a perfect Rochester: not traditionally handsome, difficult, brusque, hard to read.  Despite her obvious beauty, Susannah York did an admirable job as a woman entitled to personal fulfillment despite her low social position in the society of her time.  The sound track is magnificent, the photography dark and moody.  The only original element missing from this abbreviated version of the text is the unusual transition device that was used to move the television viewer between the film and the commercials.  The action of the film become a still picture, the picture would transform into a painting, and the commercial interruption would ensue.  To return to the film, the viewer moved from the commercial to a painting which would then evolve into a still photo which began to move as the action resumed.  It was truly innovative work at the time.  I have very fond memories of this film and am DELIGHTED that it is finally available for purchase.
6302491940|5.0|MILLER VICKERS KIDS WITH BLOOD
B000000OSW|5.0|I am a huge fan of &quot;So&quot; and &quot;Passion,&quot; the two albums that seem to be the inspiration for this album.  You can hear snippets of &quot;So&quot; in the songs &quot;Steam&quot; and &quot;Kiss That Frog,&quot; and you can hear plenty of &quot;Passion&quot; in &quot;Fourteen Black Paintings&quot; and &quot;Blood of Eden.&quot;  At first, I thought this album was great for it's music. But lately, I've been rereading some of the lyrics from the album.  For anyone who's going through a rough patch in your life, listen to the words to &quot;Love to be Loved,&quot; and try not to be moved at the end when he cries out &quot;Though it takes all the strength in me, I let go...,&quot; releasing himself from all his negativity.  Listen to the sadness and loss in &quot;Washing of the Water,&quot; or the longing in &quot;Secret World.&quot;  As a young adult of 20, &quot;Us&quot; touched me with its melodies and original music.  As an older adult of 29, the emotional lyrics hit home every time I listen to the album.  Deeply moving.
6305538018|3.0|...then this one need not be it. Some nice ideas come together in a film that ultimately has too many twists for any of them to be surprising or exciting. Apparent themes of reality vs virtual reality are explored but in a relatively meaningless and usually contradictory way.<br />It's not a bad film per-se. It's just not a good film either. It tries to do more than it delivers.<br />If you can only see one movie this year, this one isn't it. But for the rest of us, if you get an opportunity to see it, by all means do.
B000002LIM|5.0|If there is any soundtrack that everyone should own \\"Batman\\" is the one. No, this is not the wrongly advertised and overrated Prince soundtrack that got all the attention, this is the orchestral music written by the legendary composer Danny Elfman. One of the pure highlights of this score is the fact that it does not just have one musical idea, tone or theme, it has many and they are as different from eachother as they ever could be (you would think that at least 8 different composers worked on this album). From the dark \\"main titles\\" to the fun \\"Face-Off\\" to the expolsive \\"Final Confrontation\\", this soundtrack has it all. So take my advice, if you are new to film music, pick up a copy of this cd, if you have been a long fan of film music and you don't have a copy of this cd then......god help us all!!!
B000002KO3|5.0|Alternately brooding and joyful, &quot;Remain In Light&quot; is -- for my money -- the most complex and richly satisfying of all Talking Heads fare. Don't get me wrong...I can give 5 stars to &quot;Buildings &amp; Food,&quot; &quot;Fear Of Music&quot; and &quot;True Stories,&quot; but where those albums are mostly of the &quot;quirky and perky&quot; Talking Heads variety, this one was a turning point for the band on many levels. The production is more intricate and layered, the lyrics more like poetry, the melodies more sophisticated, all of which makes this a more substantial work than anything else in their outstanding repertoire. I particularly appreciate the album's contrasts: the uptempo opening of &quot;Born Under Punches&quot; and the decidedly dark closing of &quot;The Overload&quot;; the poppy &quot;Born Under Punches&quot; and the cerebral &quot;Seen And Not Seen&quot;; the frantic pace of &quot;The Great Curve&quot; and the narcotic styling of &quot;Listening Wind.&quot; I had always suspected they were musical geniuses, but &quot;Remain In Light&quot; confirmed it for me.
B000002GFT|5.0|Fairport Convention gave us three albums in 1969, What We Did On Our Holidays, Unhalfbricking, and this one. With Unhalfbricking, the band mostly stuck to a West Coast-style folk-rock sound with covers of Dylan songs, plus a few of their own compositions. But that album contained &quot;A Sailor's Life&quot; which signaled the direction the band would turn to on Liege &amp; Lief. Liege &amp; Lief found the band turning away from the West Coast sound and exploring roots more close to home: British folk rock. So while you get some Fairport originals like &quot;Come All Ye&quot; and &quot;Crazy Man Michael&quot;, you also get some renditions of 500 year old British Isles folk songs like &quot;Tam Lin&quot; and &quot;Matty Groves&quot;, giving this album a much more medieval feel than anything they done before. Liege &amp; Lief marked a major change in the band's lineup. Ashley Hutchings left to form Steeleye Span, which basically explored the same territory of Liege &amp; Lief but in a more traditional manner. He was then replaced by future Jethro Tull bassist Dave Pegg. Sandy Denny left to form Fotheringay, then went solo, leaving the band to have even a more horrible time with keeping a steady lineup. Liege &amp; Lief is regarded as Fairport's best work, and I totally agree with that, so I suggest you go out and get a copy of this album.
B000007WNN|1.0|PEople give five stars to this album. I'll tell you about the CUlt. This is a band without any substance, a boring pseudo-pop-rock-metal-new wave band, that only tries to copy AC/DC and ZZ Top in this ELECTRIC (which is considered their best album!! Imagine the others!!) Everything here sounds a copy. The singer Astbury is horrible.
B000002UUX|4.0|Back in '88 when Mustaine's former band, the giants,  Metallica released ...And Justice For All Megadeth released the mediocre &quot; So Far, So Good, So What? &quot; and wasn't well known outside metal circles. Too keep being a viable band they had to make a follow-up so the band wouldn't just fade away like a lot of other metal bands did at the end of the 80's. They released Rust In Peace in '90 that like ...And Justice For All is considered a classic and was their  commercial breakthrough. While &quot; One &quot; made Metallica huge, they had 7 more great songs backing it up. I feel it is overated because it only has that reputation because of two songs, that of course being &quot; Holy Wars...The Punishment Due &quot; and guitar-classic &quot; Hangar 18 &quot;. &quot; Tornado Of Souls &quot; and &quot; Rust In Peace...Polaris &quot; are good songs backing up the 2 classics, but the rest of them might as well be throwaway's. Sometimes they were trying to hard to be like Metallica which is evidenced in &quot; Countdown To Extinction &quot; which has only 2 worthy songs, &quot;Countdown To Extinction &quot; and &quot;Symphony Of Destruction &quot; Same thing with &quot; Youthanasia &quot; which has &quot; Elysian Fields &quot; and the excellent &quot; Family Tree &quot;. &quot; Cryptic Writings &quot; is a rip-off of load and &quot; Risk &quot; while being horrible has the excellent metal-ballad &quot; Time: The Beginning and Time: The End &quot; and &quot; The World Needs A Hero &quot; is even worse, it's a rip-off of their own &quot; Rust In Peace &quot; and &quot; Return To Hangar &quot; is one of the worst sequels to a classic song that you could have made, not even mentioning one of the worst song's I've ever heard.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|When I saw this in theatres when it came out I stood in line waiting for a newly big busted Angelina Jolie flash her stuff all over this movie with a frown and some disgust.<br />I wanted to see a good movie, not a hyped up version of the game with naked shots to amuse and cajole the guys.<br />What I got was a little of both and a pleasing tease of male booty too. Not too bad considering \\"someone\\" knew some females would be in the crowd too.<br />Angelina played Croft pretty well and while I've never liked the video games I enjoyed the background history that the movie provided as well as the great kick-... action scenes that had my blood pumping.<br />Obviously the stunts were near as impossible as they could get--I, like most anyone else, would have bruises for the rest of my life in every aspect of action that Laura presented INCLUDING that awesome fight scene on bungee chords.<br />I liked it.
B00000G3PL|5.0|This is an awesome collection of 4 action packed, full of laughter and good times movies you will ever watch. You have your choice of widescreen or full screen on the first 3 movies (widescreen only on the 4th) and Lethal Weapon 4 has alot of special features that will add more than enough entertainment than any one person can stand. The fact that they were abke to keep most of the characters around (and keep adding new ones with each movie) was amazing and allowed you to get to know each character better and better with each movie.<BR>You will be hard pressed to find a better collection of movies (at least until Star Wars &amp; Idiana Jones come out) and the only other set that matches these so far is the Die Hard series. Buy this set and you won't be disappointed.
B000003N8R|4.0|I'm not a jazz expert, but I heard about Colthrane, saw this amrvellous packed CD and decided to give it a shot. Great album. I can know understand why some peopl ehate jazz: some cannot stand the infintie ammount of delicate and intricate time changs by so few instruments, nor one can believe the ammount of playing Colthrane does in each song !! Great songs, great albu, I'll try to improve my jazz knowledge from now on.
B000002KHH|5.0|In 1970, Sabbath released an album that changed the world music forever. It was dark, gloomy, and melodic, especially the song \\" Black Sabbath \\". This album however they broke through and showed the world how worthy they were. While Planet Caravan, Electric Funeral, Rat Salad, and Fairies Wear Boots are outdated filler. This album deserves its classic status because of four timeless songs. Everybody knows War Pigs, Paranoid, and Iron Man and they got their deserved radio play, but they missed out on one song that is Sabbath's best and one of the Top 5 of all-time. That would have to be \\" Hand Of Doom \\" It's got great lyrics and it goes from mellow to hard and back. I don't think it ever got played because it has to do with addiction, but it is the true masterpiece on this album.
B00005K3O4|4.0|When I picked up this movie I thought sure-fire that it would be a bomb, but prone to watching a variety of movies and some of them less than good, I gave it a try with a dour demenor.<br />It was as coooky as I thought it would be but in the silliest way. Pop corn as tracking devices, a ballon dog, cotton candy body bags, and big silly shoes that leave flouresent foot prints. The acting of &quot;Mike&quot; and &quot;Debbie&quot; was pretty dry and the only one with spice was Mooney, but I gave them a little leeway on that as I was enjoying the comical effect of another &quot;scarey&quot; yet funny Klown. <br />&quot;It&quot; scared me more but Killer Klowns from Outerspace is a real hoot.
6301967992|1.0|i'd been wanting to see this film for ages - as a fan of polanski and vampire films of the genre.  when i finally did, i wish i could reclaim the 2 hours of my life i spent to watch it...<br />in viewing the film, i can understand how it may have once been funny.  unfortunately that was over 35 years ago.  today, it's merely dull.  i'd describe the acting as camp - more slapstick than humorous - but not camp enough to be enjoyable.  immediately after seeing the film, i couldn't recall a single line of dialogue - so there was nothing quotable.  the plot is haphazard - you don't really understand that the characters are trying to do or why.  and without such an understanding, you never quite figure out why a professor would tolerate such an idiot for an assistant - especially since the ultimate ramifications are pretty high.  and the ending is just thrown on - sort of like they got tired of making the movie.<br />on the up side, sharon tate is beautiful - you can understand how she captured polanski's attention.  some of the set designs are stunning - particularly the interiors.  the filming, while alternatively stunning and jittery, is interesting to watch.<br />however, these plusses don't outweigh the negatives.  while watching the film, i kept on saying to myself &quot;this is the guy who did 'rosemary's baby'?&quot;  i couldn't quite figure out what he was parodying or trying to point out.  then i gave up after i realized that it wasn't worth the effort.  frankly, i'd skip this film and pick up an old hammer horror film with christopher lee instead.
B00004Y6NM|2.0|This is Clapton's lowest point in his career, the day he succumbed to the usual record company pressure for &quot;GIVE ME A HIT SINGLE SOON&quot;, or &quot;GIVE ME A HIT VIDEO FROM A HIT SINGLE SOON&quot;..The album is totally commercial, what is no surprise if you check who is at the helm of production: Mr. Phil Collins, who a long time ago was a serious musician in a great band called GENESIS, but who decided to go with all his force and talent into mainstream pop music. Clapton seems lost here, the songs are inconsistent, maybe because his record company brought others producers, including Van Halen's Ted Templeman. The album is so heartless and uninspired that you can't believe it's Clapton on it. Only &quot;SHE'S WAITING&quot; appears in the CROSSROADS compilation...
B00005LKHW|5.0|That is so funny, I can't believe how funny this movie is!<br />I like the sex with a apple pie scene so much....its almost as funny as the bathroom part in Something About Mary!  You know the part when the stuff gets in her hair?  That is so funny.<br />I think movies are much more funnier now then they used to be, because theres lots of funny sex stuff in them!  My parents are stupid because they don't like this movie but I do!  Boring old movies didn't have any masterbation scenes in them because they were so old.  When the girl masterbates its so hot!  I like masterbation.  But I don't do it THOUGH!  My second favorite movie is American Beauty because it has funny sex stuff too with the lady with her legs up in the air and two masterbation scenes!  That's so funny.        <br />This is a exellent kids movie for grown ups and kids alike!
B00003CXXS|4.0|There was only one thing I liked about JP2 (when the trailer is upside down and the woman is laying on cracked glass--that whole scene was terrific) and there were MORE things I liked about JP3.<br />What a come back! But...it was SO SHORT! It had nearly everything I wanted to see in it but just seemed that there was little room for character development to introduce the new people. Tia Leone's character....was a tad depressing.<br />When I knew she was going to be in it I thought that I was going to be impressed...instead I was just, amused and or left disgusted; sitting there just shaking my head at her stupid antics. They could have casted her with a better part to play as &quot;Mom&quot;. She was kind of a twit as she was.<br />But I really enjoyed the movie otherwise. While JP2 is going to collect dust on someone elses' video cabinet, I'll let JP3 collect a little dust in mine and be more satisfied.
6302752337|5.0|A lot of people say that EASY RIDER is merley a biker movie with two stoned biker hippies going across America with a kick butt soundtrack. However it is more than that <br />I admit when I first saw EASY RIDER I was not too thrilled but after seeing again and looking at it more closely I realized how great a movie it is. It is a true experience of the uncensored sixties. How the life of a hippie really was. His experiences with drugs and love and rejection from society.<br />When you look at this movie it seems really simple so why was it so successful? Well I can only say in my opinion that this movie had to be made in 1969 to be successful. If it was made today it just would not be the same.<br />That is what makes EASY RIDER so special. The fact that it is the ultimate sixties experience. Also with Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper and a awesome soundtrack with Jimi Hendrix, Steppen Wolf ,The Byrds and The Band how could this movie be bad? In conclusion EASY RIDER is one of the groovy, trippy, American classics that is just down right cool! Highly Recommended!
B000002G89|4.0|Great album, all tune are killers, even the cover versions. Great band, greta production, it is not outdated, even being recorded in 1974.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This DVD is what DVD players were made for - crisp visuals, masterful sound and lots of goodies like left-out scenes and Francis Ford Coppola's narrative of GF1 and GF2.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Many people have written that this is an attempt to bring the musical kicking and screaming into the 21st century. I'm not sure if Baz Lurhmann was actually trying to do that when he made it.  I think he was just trying to make an entertaining movie.  And in that respect he succeeded admirably.<br />In many ways the style of Moulin Rouge is an amalgamation of his previous two films.  Visually it looks very like Romeo+Juliet (with choppy camera movement and off centered close ups) and it has the same snappy dance sets and offbeat humour as Strictly Ballroom.  <br />Plot wise it is very simple - boy meets girl, girl is promised to evil man, girl tries to save boy from evil man, love conquers all and then a tragic ending - but what is wrong with having a simple plot.  The first part is quite light and frothy but the overtones for what follow are present.  The second half slows the pace somewhat but descends into some quite powerful drama (maybe melodrama in some places but only just).<br />To those who criticise this film for being unoriginal in its plot I ask what is so wrong with that?  Are we no longer allowed make love stories because other people have already made them?  Not every film needs to be completely original.  The film is a simple story well told and surely that is quite enough.<br />The film is a visual feast, sets and costumes are lavish and colorful.  The dance sequences are beautifully put together (perhaps some could be a bit longer - the highlight for me was the Roxanne sequence).  The music is unoriginal in content (only one new song) but completely original in the way it is used (Like A Virgin is a masterpiece of usage and again Roxanne is powerfully passionate).  The singing is excellent when one considers that most of the leads are not professional singers.  The acting is generally of a high quality (especially that of McGregor) and there is genuine chemistry between the leads.  The villian is perhaps a touch too one-dimensional but blame can not be placed on the actor but rather the script which does not allow him character development.  This is probably the main problem I had with the film.  It might have been more interesting to have a complex villian.  But perhaps that would have taken from the love story.<br />This film is definitely not everybody's cup of tea.  If you're not into musicals, or you have not enjoyed a previous Lurhmann experience, you are probably wiser to avoid it.  <br />If you are open-minded about them then give it a whirl.  It's definitely an easy way to spend 2.5 hours and you may suprise yourself in how much you enjoyed it.  I know I certainly did.
B00004Z459|4.0|I listen to mostly hip hop but this CD, since the first listen, is one of my favorites. <BR>Beats are tight, Vocals are tight, and you can identify with a lot of what they're talking about. <BR>What more you want?
B000009EAD|5.0|What an album. This was my introduction to Iced Earth, and I purchased it around a month ago. Just from this they became one of my favorite bands. I would call this style melodic thrash. The guitar work is quite good, and the drums are quite interesting. Even though they use double-bass drums, they don't constantly bombard you with them.  This gives the album a more &quot;down-to-earth&quot; feel. Barlow's vocals are just great to listen to.  You could even call them &quot;operatic.&quot; Very much influenced by the power metal style. Overall, excellent in the music department.<br />The album is filled with two basic styles: melancholy and heartfelt ballads and crushing metal tunes. Surprisingly enough, they do both very well.  Much like Metallica at their peak, they ride the line btween melody and aggression well.  All of the songs are strong, with good lyrics and interesting riffs. But my absoulute favorite thing about this disc is the three-part closer &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes.&quot; It tells the story of the coming and reign of the AntiChrist. Don't worry, these guys are some insipid Deicide clones; they aren't Christian bashers. Instead of some stupid &quot;evil&quot; lyrics, they tell an epic story of horror. This is refreshing and unique, another thing that puts Iced Earth high in my book.<br />I definitely recommend this to anyone interested. IE are a great American metal band and this is a fine example of their talent. If you like 80's thrash or any melodic metal, you will probably enjoy this. Now quit reading and buy!!
B000002JS6|5.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All that talk about AC/DC's place in music history and comparisons to other bands.  Blah, blah, blah.  No one has mentioned that &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; is the best, all-time, most perfect strip club song EVER!
1558908846|4.0|Who says every movie needs a brain? Sometimes the purpose of watching a moving is to give your brain a rest. Isn't that what &quot;entertainment&quot; is all about? You might want to watch &quot;A Room with a View&quot; at one time, but &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; at another.<br />Trust me. If you just want to relax and enjoy some great visual/audio special effects, awesome costumes, and unbounded imagination, this is one of the best in its category.
B00005QGAX|4.0|As most people know, Bad is one of Michael's best albums -- in terms of sales, awards, Top 10 singles, and diverse music -- so the album automatically gets a few stars for its history (no pun intended).  However, moving forward, this album offers some unique DVD-like (but audio) extras such as &quot;Streetwalker&quot; and &quot;Fly Away&quot; which can be considered the cherry on top of this already terrific album.  &quot;Streetwalker&quot; is easily my favorite additional song on the CD because of its catchy intro and outro.  The commentary by Quincy is also a great addition and gives you some exciting &quot;behind the scenes&quot; knowledge.  All in all, this is a great purchase for the MJ fan or for the person who doesn't own &quot;Bad&quot; yet.
0689505698|5.0|My mother in law has long been animatedly telling my three yr old the story of the three little pigs whenever we're stuck in the car for a while-- and he loved every minute of it, every time. My husband and I were already big fans of Helen Oxenbury (Check out &quot;We're Going On a Bear Hunt&quot;)-- so when we saw this, we were sold. But we had no idea we'd instantly love it *this* much. Other reviewers have given away it's secrets--suffice it to say that I was not expecting the pig to pull out a drill, or the wolves to refer to all the tea leaves in thier china tea pot! I'm more than willing to read it to my son again and again-- and that's saying a lot for a children's book. I'm online right now getting it for my neice who will be one in 3 days-- but I'm really getting it for my brother ;o)
B0000046KM|5.0|I simply don't know how to review a cd such as this. It's so rare when a disc is released that says so much in such beautiful and remarkable ways that it literally leaves me in tears. Where do you start? <br />I had originally purchased this disc on a whim...I wasn't aware of how powerful Shirley's music/voice was but the song selection attracted me and being orchestrated by Johnny Mandel I thought it might be good for an occassional listen. Looking back I can only sit and wonder at my innocence. The sheer beauty of Ms. Horn's voice, the range, subtly of phrasing and simple &quot;good taste&quot; in performing each song is just short of a miracle. Songs such as &quot;Where Do You Start?&quot;, &quot;Return To Paradise&quot; and of course the title track still thrill me with every listen and trust me when I say I've listened to this cd many, many times. And I am still in awe of what I hear. It is truly inspiring to hear a singer of Shirley's experience be  able to bring not only a certain worldweariness to these selections but also a touch of inncocence that is hard to deny. That in itself is what makes Shirley Horn a truly great singer.... these simple contradictions in style! And, lest I forget, Johhny Mandel's sublime orchestration is truly the &quot;second voice&quot; on the cd. If anyone could complement Shirley's voice it would have to be J, Mandel's orch. Is it any wonder this disc has won several grammy's? <br />I can only hope that you will find yourself one day purchasing a copy of this amazing disc and finding out for yourself how simple, honest and mature music is still being performed.Believe me...this woman sings from which only time and experience can teach us. <br />Here's to Shirley....for giving us a wonderful gift!

B00005OAIE|5.0|I love John Mayer's music.  I just bought &quot;Room for Squares&quot; last week, and I can't stop listening to it.  Yes, he sounds like Dave Matthews, but what's wrong with that?  His guitar skills are remarkable, and his voice has a hoarse tenderness that lends his lyrics even more weight.  His lyrics!  John Mayer's lyrics!!  I love the lines from &quot;No Such Thing&quot; -- &quot;I wanna run through the halls of my high school/I wanna scream at the top of my lungs/I just found there's no such thing as the real world/just a lie you got to rise above&quot;  Every song on this cd is insightful and thought-provoking--Mayer takes you on a journey through the pain and loss of adulthood.  I love intelligent musicians, and John Mayer has just moved to the top of my list.
0553106635|5.0|\\"A Storm of Swords\\" is the third novel in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" epic by George R. R. Martin.  Primarily a novel of politics, betrayal and wars, Martin brings the fantasy genre to new highs.  I wish I can express fully the feelings I have regarding this series but suffice it to say that George R. R. Martin work is a breath of fresh air.   The epic \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is head and shoulders above any other Fantasy epic/novel out there today.  Best of all it is a book for adults.  I grew up with Tolkien and read my share of Jorden, Feist, Goodkind, etc.   This story features characters acting as real people in extraordinary circumstances.  This is not the traditional fantasy's with wonder and magic, here there is sex, patricide, maiming,  incest, zombies, and more.   I will not give anything away from the story except to state that some wars are settled and some kings are crowned and/or killed.  The beauty of this series is that Martin actually kills off main characters and has the skill to keep the story going.   Things happen in his books, readers are not lead down a continual path were plots lines are kept alive for no reason other than to add fodder to an already flagging story.<br />Do yourself a favor and enjoy.   I recommend \\"A Storm of Sword\\" to all people and especially to those who are tired of the old fantasy and magic stories.
B000003S09|5.0|I used to listen to &quot;I talk to the Wind&quot; when I was just a child. My brother bought the album back in 1969, then went off to Vietman. Me &amp; my sister were 9 years old and we would sit and listen to it constantly. The words were comforting somehow. They have stayed in our minds all these years, but it always haunted us because we never paid attention to the artist or album name when we were young, and had no idea who sang it. I'm so glad I found it. My brother may even be surprized when he hears it again for the first time in 32 years. I highly recommend this album.
0783225903|5.0|Brazil is like a dream gone bad.  We see that individuality is not valued.  We also see that one can dream outsde the stringent boundaries of society.  Our protagonist is lost in the governmental mindlessness of redtape.  Some outlaws exist, led by Robert DeNiro, who try to bring free thought to our mindless society.  The rich are free to fulfill the idiocies of their existence while the workers are chained to their mundane lives.  There is horror in this movie which comes from the mind.  No blood is spilled and there is very little romance.  Our hero yearns to have his own little patch of peace where he can live his life by his own rules.  Society does not want this, he must conform.  Finally the movie ends on a dream of false hope.  A devastating piece of work.  A must see!
B000002B1M|3.0|this is a good cd and is worth a listen.  would give it 3.5 stars if i could.  however, i was disappointed with the production.  i miss the beats by premo, large professor and q-tip.  they made nas sound that much better.  the trackmasters just don't measure up.  i know illmatic is classic and it is unfair to expect nas to make an album of that quality again (especially on his sophmore effort), but this didn't even come close in my opinion.  i guess illmatic was one of those rare gems that someone manages to create once in a great while.  i was also very disappointed that the cd didn't have &quot;silent murder&quot; on it.  it was only on the cassette for some reason.  that was my favorite track from this album.  as far as i'm concerned, this was the last good nas cd.  it seems to have gone all downhill from here.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is one of my absolute favorites. I admit the first time I saw it, I enjoyed it but wasn't ready to run out and buy my own copy. Once I bought the DVD though, I was enchanted by the story. I have seen this movie over 3 times now and am still fascinated by it. It is a very simple story but very gratifying. It is filled with clues about life and the powerful human being inside people. You will walk away from it ready to make a change in the world, for the better! Give it a chance, you will love it.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed brings alot of positivity in HC, and displays a passion for life.  This band may be labled as christian but definitely reaches more genres than they get credit for.  I am a 40 yr old mother and love this band.  They have brought back a certain passion in my life for music.  I don't like to hear that they are copycats from Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains or whoever.   They have a distinct sound and lyrically, Mr. Stapp is more talented than I have ever imagined.  I have been a fan since November 1997 and will continue to stay dedicated.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This a classic film noir on a par with the best of Hitchcock. The plot was so ingenious and imaginative-a man is searching for the rapist and murderer of his wife even though he has an unimaginable handicap-he can't make new memories and he forgets everything after 10 or 15 minutes that he's just been through. That leaves a compelling plot, and Christopher Nolan's screenplay milks it for all it's worth in this terrific movie. <BR>Add the incredible acting skills of Guy Pearce, great supporting performances by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss and you have what is in my opinion the best movie of 2001. I can tell when a mystery is great because I was so blown away by the truth that was revealed at the end (or in this case, the beginning)!!! Astounding.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This new &quot;Ultimate Edition DVD&quot; of Terminator 2 Judgement Day, one of the biggest box office smashes of all time, is truly The Ultimate Edition. Unless you get this outside of the US (which I did) you have two disks. One disk is the movie (THREE versions of the movie, in fact), and the next disk is all the special features. And it takes DAYS getting through every feature. I mean, three documentary, 8 trailers and TV spots, an entire script, interviews that you can access separately, and 52 chapters of behind the scenes footage, from makeup to visual effects, from editing to restoring deleted scenes. There are so many special features, this is what DVD was made for! You can also look at the original drawings of certain scenes, awesome!!!!<br />However, I find the real highlight of this disk (or disks) to be the movie itself, I mean WOW!!! You get three, I repeat, three, versions of the movie. One is the original theatrical version, featuring no cut out scenes (the worst), the special edition, featuring 16 minutes of additional footage (second best) and the Extended Special Edition that you need a code for (the best) which features 18 minutes of additional footage, as well as an alternate ending. Here, now, I will give you a step-by-step description of how to get this extended special edition. I'm sure most of you people reading this know how to already, but this is for those who didn't know this version existed, or don't know how to get it. What you do is, you go to the features menu. It'll say &quot;Theatrical Version&quot; and &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Click on &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Then, you highlight &quot;Play Special Edition&quot; and type in (you may have to type ENTER in-between each number) EIGHT TWO NINE NINE SEVEN (8 2 9 9 7) and then, the &quot;Go To Theatrical Version&quot; option changes to &quot;Play Extended Special Edition&quot;. This is the definitive version of the movie. I believe that every single little, tiny scene that theycut out is in this version. Well, thats the code, now back to my review.<br />The picture and audio on this disk are SO awesome, you won't believe it. Crystal clear picture, and sound so loud that it's like you're in a movie theatre. The additional, restored scenes are remastered as well, and slip perfectly into the movie. If you haven't even seen the film, you won't even notice these scenes put into it. Usually, on additional scenes, the picture is dirty and shakes. Not in these added scenes. And, to make it even better, the scenes are presented in 2:35:1 widescreen anamorphic format. Yes!! Just the first disk makes this DVD the ultimate edition!! Also, there's an audio commentary by 26 members of the cast and crew, however, this commentary is just interviews put together to sound like a commentary. However, there's a noticable glitch in the theatrical version, due to the commentary. Well, if you watch this commentary on one of the special editions, you'll notice it's the same commentary as the theatrical version, but they talk about deleted scenes as well. You may, also, notice that they continue talking about the deleted &quot;Dream Sequence&quot; at the hospital, when it goes into the next scene. So, now, when you watch the theatrical version, you'll notice that the beggining scene with Sarrah Connor watching the tape from six months ago, the beggining of the scene is cut off!!! Oops! Well, that's forgivible. Now, the second disk (or the second side of the disk) has lots of special features. The three documentarys include &quot;The Making Of Terminator 2 Judgement Day&quot;, &quot;T2 More Than Meets The Eye&quot;, where they talk about deleted sequences and the reason they were cut. The last is &quot;The Making Of Terminator 2 3-D Breaking The Screen Barrier&quot;, about the making of that 3-D terminator ride. I loved that ride (yes, I went on it) and this documentary is really interesting. The rest of the features, well, I'm not sure I kinow all of them. MaybeYOU should discover all the features on this disk. If you own the previous DVD release of T2 (which had no extras), then trash it and get this &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;. You WON'T be dissipointed.<br />If you found my review helpful, please be sure and vote for me! Thank You Very Much!
B00005QIPH|4.0|Okay, okay so we love the strokes.  what's not to love?  Anyone looking at this review won't waste their money buying this cd.  It's good.  And if you like this check out a band, as yet unheard of in the corporate world of music, My Regrets.  Caught their show in Portland, OR (I know, who would of thought!) and they rocked.  Awesome vocals from a lead singer who channels Iggy Pop and good drums, bass, and guitar.  Not bad looking either.  I digress.  Love The Strokes?  Love My Regrets.  You can thank me later.
B00005MP58|5.0|The acting in this version of P&amp;P is EXCELLENT.  Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth has her sass and cheek.  She shows Elizabeth's gradual love for Darcy perfectly.  The actress who plays Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingly are very well done.  The mother and younger sisters are played almost too well.  (The screaching of the mother gets tiresome after a while.)  The stand out performance of this movie is by far Colin Firth.  I did not know who he was, typical of Americans I'm sure, but I do now.  He can speak clearly with his eyes.  It is rare for an actor to have such a gift.  An example of what I'm talking about is the scene where Darcy watches Elizabeth play the piano with his sister.  Breathtaking!!  I have, also, just had the pleasure to watch Mr. Firth in &quot;Bridget Jones Diary.&quot;  As far as I concerned, Hollywood needs to snatch him up with joy.  You have made a new American fan, Mr. Firth.  However, simply put, this is an excellent film.
0451169514|5.0|Before I say why I love this book so much, a helpful suggestion.  Please, if you want to appreciate King's more marketable stories, please read the Dark Tower series.  I don't think that I'm giving away anything here, but the sequence in &quot;It&quot; that deals with 'turtles' (those of you who have read the Dark Tower know why I'd focus on this) will take on much more meaning.  On to the review.  I think that people have a misconception about what makes for effective horror writing.  You have to care about the characters for horror to be effective.  Otherwise, it's not horror, it's comedy.  Think about it: in the span of a few short pages, King makes Georgie a character we care about--that's why you really feel it in the pit of your stomach when Georgie's encounter with Pennywise reaches its conclusion.  This book is about normal kids and adults (who happen to be incredibly well-developed characters) finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances..That's why &quot;It&quot; is so effective.  Minor complaint: Richie does not ring true as an adult or a child.  He's the only character that is not believable..fortuneately, even though he has a tremendous amount of dialogue, he's really not important to the story..he's there for comic relief.  Finally, by all means avoid the mini-series.  I can't for the life of me understand how anyone who has read the book can stomach it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The deleted scenes were great.  I think the fact that the sound is THX more than makes up for the fact that the disc is not DTS.  I think Lucas will not do a DTS version.  As for the commentary by the director.  This is worth it's weight in gold to see the true ideas behind the Menace.  The making of the movie featurette was awesome.  I think if you bought this movie soley on the merits of just the movie, you should just keep the VHS version.  DVD is a spectacular way to deliver not just the movie, but also the thought process behind it.  I was extremely pleased with this.  I think anyone who really takes the time to rip it apart because it was not the movie you wanted to see when it was first released in theatres, will be more than pleased when ATOC is released next spring.
6303036570|5.0|Brian DePalma has made many great movies through the years, but this one, I rate his finest work. This film has a non-stop sizzle and the most incredible atmosphere from beginning to end that truly evokes the feel of the 70s. From cocaine fueled disco dancing club scenes, retro clothes, big hair and sideburns, to the fantastic pulsating soundtrack filled with classics of that era.<br /><br />Carlito Brigante, brilliantly portrayed by the master, Al Pacino, is out of jail early looking to go straight after doing 5 years time for dealing smack. As we open, Carlito is talking to us, telling us his story from the future ending of the with the wisdom of 20/20 hindsight.<br /><br />Sean Penn is also in perhaps his finest acting role here as Davy Kleinfeld. We meet him in the courtroom at the open. For getting Carlito freed, Davy will try to get Carlito involved in his crooked coked up mess of a life. After stealing millions from a mob boss and losing control over his life completely, Carlito has a great line where he admonishes Davy. \\"You not a lawyer anymore, you a gangster now, whole new ballgame,\\" Indeed.<br /><br />Davy is only the first of many cohorts who will try to [pull] Carlito into a life he is trying to break away from. Shortly after being released, Carlito's nephew drags him along on a drug pick-up. In the one of the best creative camera shots ever lensed in film, we see through the other players sunglasses as he leans over the pool table to make a shot, a double image reflected, of the nephew in trouble. Carlito, again, forced to deal with the consequences he's been unwillingly dragged into.<br /><br />Along the way Carlito comes to a face off at the club with greasy young upstart drug dealer, \\"Benny Blanco from the Bronx\\" played by a viciously ambitious John Leguzamo. Carlito doesn't realize that Benny is playing for keeps, and so he fatally underestimates him.<br /><br />By the time Carlito realizes he's got no one to trust but himself, it's too late to undo the damage, leading to a vengeful mob cavalcade that takes us on a wild edge of your seat ride up, down, around, and then all the way to Grand Central Station to the not so grand ending, which is where the movie begins.<br /><br />Please don't think of this as Scarface Part Two, it's not!!  Although \\"Scarface\\" is a definite DePalma Masterpiece, it has nothing of the atmospheric sizzle of \\"Carlito's Way\\".  The roles of Tony Montana, a reprehensible character, and Carlito Brigante, a totally sympathetic character who falls into the wrong circumstances time and time again, are in no way similar.  Just because both characters are Latino drug dealers, played by the incredible classic screen legend Al Pacino, the similarity starts and ends there.<br /><br />When you come right down to it, for the best in every aspect of what makes an entertaining and outstanding film, one of the best ways, is \\"Carlito's Way.\\"mob cavalcade that takes us on a wild edge of your seat ride up, down, around, and then all the way to Grand Central Station to the not so grand ending, which is where the movie begins.

6301174240|5.0|Truly, this video from Michael Jackson, was made to shock and impress his viewers, and it has.  I love it so much that I watch it all the time and my tape is about to ware out!  I think that the direction of the video was put together well, and I am glad that he had decided to do this project.  This will alway remain in MY PERSONAL like files!  Hopefully he will make more like this!!!  :)<br />Keep it alive Michael and God Bless<BR>Love, your favorite fan,<BR>Elizabeth<BR>&gt;&lt;)))&gt;
B00003CX5P|5.0|I too was dissapointed about the lack of a DTS version of this film.  But, the Dolby Digital sountrack is very impressive.  Audio and visual wise, this is one of the best DVD's that I own, and it is by far the best Dolby Digital DVD that I own.  I can't understand why they couldn't have put a DTS version on the first disc since all of the extras are on disc two.<br />Don't let the lack of DTS, or your dislike of the Phantom Menace keep you from owning what I feel should be a part of anyone's DVD collection who cares to get the best out of their system.<br />I can't wait to see the other DVD's in the series.  They should all be very very impressive!
B00003CXP1|5.0|I was often intrigued by the sad title of this much talked about film.  Yet world of substance abuse was so foreign to me it kept me away from renting or even buying.  Well, I got to watch it on Sundance film channel last night, thinking I'd just watch for 15 minutes.  Boy did it blow my mind...... not too many movies do this to me.  I couldn't sleep well last night.  I kept hearing that powerful soundtrack in my head.  I don't know which I love more, tension building music or the movie itself?  They go together so well.<br />Now I see why other viewers talk about the last 30 minutes of this film.  It is so emotionally intense it made me cry.  I never did drugs in my life and pray that my 14 year old son would stay away from it at any cost.  Yet I truly felt for those people with their vices.  For their lost dreams.  I understood why it was called &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; then.   This is an intelligent and mature film.  My admiration goes to the young, intellectual director who lets me experience the world I never been to.  Next time I hear the news about Robert Downey Jr,  I know I won't be laughing.
B00000634J|5.0|If you need a great overview of John Lennon's most famous hit songs, this CD is the only place you need to go. It pretty much has everything a fan would need to hear. It's amazing to hear some of these songs that still sound crisp and fresh and still ring true to this day. From &quot;Imagine&quot; to &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot; to &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;, John Lennon is the music world's greatest songwriter(him and Paul), and this collection only shows why he's loved and respected so much. Lennon might've gone into light pop with songs like &quot;Woman&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;, and &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;, but it is good pop at least!. There is also the almost forgotten #1 hit &quot;Whatever Gets You Thru The Night&quot;, which features Elton John. A definitive collection that needs to be in your CD library. If not, what are you waiting for?!.
0679746048|5.0|Reading Girl, Interruped is not an easy experience, but it's a very good one indeed. Anyone who has wondered 'what the hell am I doing here?' or 'it's only me or the world went Crazy?' will easily indentify him or herself to Susanna. <BR>Plus, there is all the late 60's madness surruonding every single page. It's not hard to close your eyes after reading some pages and just listen -inside your mind- songs by Jefferson Airplane, Buffalo Springfield, Janis Joplin ... and so many others, becase they get alive along with the book. <BR>I suggest to anyone who liked this book to move on to Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, because this book is as good and deep as Girl, Interrupted.
B000002B30|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is a true rock and roll icon. There's no question about it. This collection of his greatest hits is a reminder of how great his music and lyrics are. &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot; is the most haunting song he's ever done. You also get all of the great rockers like &quot;Born In The USA&quot;, &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; and &quot;Glory Days&quot; among many more. There is a horrible mistake in not including his version of &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;, but, what are you gonna do?.
B00005LC1H|4.0|For anyone, the 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers -- set in its namesake, a seedy British hotel -- could serve as an expert course on the construction and execution of the perfect farce.  John Cleese (of Monty Python) and Connie Booth (who both appear in the show) have created the last word in reference material for this comedy genre.  The video and audio quality of the DVD is excellent, and the shows themselves are hilarious and delightful to watch.<br />  The supplemental material is rather hit or miss, and sometimes outright strange.  For reasons that escape me, the directors' commentary tracks can only be heard completely isolated from the soundtrack of the show.  The microphone for the commentary was apparently placed up the nose of director J.H. Davies -- no kidding -- because when he is not speaking -- which is most of the time -- you can hear the wind whistling through his nasal canal, as well as the slightest snort or forced exhalation registering his amusement as watches the material.  You can even hear quite clearly as he slurps from a cup of tea.  On the whole, when he does speak (and I have only listened to 2 episodes of commentary), his comments are not always of interest. (Comments by director Bob Spiers seem better.)  More satisfying are interviews with Cleese and other cast members (though not Connie Booth! [sigh]).  A film of the abandoned and gutted building which served as the hotel goes on for five minutes, room to room, and is simply bizarre.  There is however, an excellent highlight reel of Fawlty Towers' best encounters between the ficticious staff and guests, and fun out-takes<br />   Don't buy for it the extras, but the set is worth every penny for the comic gold of these 12 perfect half-hours of laughter.  My personal favorites include &quot;A Touch of Class,&quot; in which Basil tries to lure a better class of clientele to the inn, &quot;Basil the Rat,&quot; involving the escape of the bellman's unlikely pet during a visit from a Public Healthinspector, and &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse,&quot; where an guest's untimely demise requires moving the body from room to room.  Communication Problems is both a great episode and a particularly nimble demonstration of classic farcical techniques, if you're into that.<br />  I would have given it five stars if the supplemental material, particularly the commentary. was as good as the actual show.
B00005OAJ1|2.0|I've been a big fan of &quot;The D&quot; for a couple years now... ever since seeing their HBO shows.  In fact, I have even seen them live a couple times.  Needless to say, I couldn't wait for this CD.  <BR>Finally a CD that is a high quality recording instead of the lame bootleg songs from napster!<BR>Well, all the songs are there but they have been refined and tweaked so much that I can't even listen to it.<BR>The beauty of this duo was their acoustic heavy metal and inside joke of them thinking they were big stars.<BR>Now that they are using a full band it just isn't as funny and you can't even enjoy the guitar playing.<BR>The in-between comedy bits are kind of funny but all in all it is a major letdown.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I was at first distracted by the prominence of the obviously programmed beats, but now this seems like one of Leonard Cohen's very best albums. As many reviewers have noted, the riches of this album reveal themselves slowly. The lyrics here are full of hard-won wisdom and mourning, and after repeated listenings even the initially jarring (to me) electronic beats seem essential to the work. An amazingly fully realized album.
B00003CXRM|3.0|The music was fantastic. The cinematography well deserved the nomination it received. However, Clooney's character was borderline grating. Solid scenes nestled between stretches of mediocre ones that soured the grapes. This averaged to an overall rating of 3. The movie had classic potential but fell off the wagon. Director Joel Coen has greater successes ahead.
0684800713|5.0|Oddly enough, while I was reading &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; I wasn't overly impressed. As always, Hemingway's writing is outrageously good; in parts of the novel I almost had to stop and catch my breath in admiration of the work Hemingway produced. Nevertheless, I was growing impatient with the storyline, the characters entering and re-entering the novel, and the large amount of information that seemed irrelevant to any sort of larger theme. I was actually quite disappointed as I finished the book.<br />However, without any planning on my part, the book all began to make sense once I had given my mind time to put the pieces together. I then discovered, much to my initial surprise, that &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is amazing, absolutely incredibly engrossing literature. First of all, credit must be given to Hemingway's unique writing style. The direct, minimal tone of the novel is brilliant; no words are ever used that could be excised from the novel, and this allows Hemingway to say far, far more with a few words than other authors could with far more. Also, the characters are so well defined that they leap off the page. Each and every character in the book, including minor characters, not only ring true but become familiar to the reader as time goes on. And finally, once the book has settled in, the themes and concepts Hemingway had in mind become clear; disillusionment, amorality, and loss of innocence.<br />In sum, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is not a book that will be immediately enjoyable. You're going to have to put some effort into this to get a lot out of it. Nevertheless, Hemingway rewards the work the book requires by creating one of the most fascinating, insightful, entertaining, and well-written novels I've read in a long time. It may require a lot of effort, but it's worth it.

B00005JKES|5.0|I never saw the show when it was on TV.  I had heard a little bit about the hype.  Recently I rented the pilot at my local video store.  I must say that I am hooked.  I can not wait to see the rest of this series.  <BR>I am a huge X-Files fan.  I can now see why everyone thinks it's a rip-off of Twin Peaks.  I still love X-Files; but, it's going to be a toss up this Christmas to see which DVD set I buy: Twin Peaks Season One or X-Files Season Four.  I'm sure I'll eventually get both.  But I'm more excited about Twin Peaks!
B00005QIPH|4.0|I first heard of The Strokes after picking up a copy of the THE FACE. This band had had the Brits drooling over them for months. I downloaded some of their tracks, and fell in love with the song &quot;Last Nite&quot;. Julian has such a fantastic voice, it sounds about ten years older then his real age (about 22?), and reminds me of Lou Reed. Granted, there is nothing new and mindblowing on this record, but the music is just plain GOOD. <br />I am a True New Yorker now living in Scotland, and putting this record on reminds me of all the grit, rawness, and coolness I miss about the city. And I am proud to say I own a copy of the Euro version, which has a much sexier cover!
B00005ATQF|3.0|&quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; . . . it was good, but where did Stanley Kubrick mess up on this number?<BR>  i am a HUGE Stanley Kubrick fan, and i own many of his films, but not this one.  i rented it, and was suprised to say that i was not what i expected.  it's not a bad DVD, but it just wasn't good.<BR>  &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is about a group of Marines in Vietnam.  the first half consists of their brutal basic training, under the iron fist of the merciless Sgt. Hartman, brilliantly portrayed by Lee Ermey.  <BR>  the second half takes place in good ole 'Nam, where our friends are battling an unseen enemy.  i loved the first half, but the 'Nam part was poorly-made and rather bland.  if you want the greatest war film, check out &quot;Platoon&quot;. <BR>  if you want to see a good movie, check out &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.  it's not good, but worth seeing.  the action scenes are horribly photographed, and the screenplay of banal and dark.  better luck next time, Stanley
B000002UB6|5.0|LET IT BE started as the GET BACK album, a project started at the beginning of 1969. It was to be a live-in-the studio record with no overdubs, no tracking, no fiddling, or nothing. It was supposed to be one of the Beatles' most active projects together. But, it soon grew to be one of the most miserable sessions on earth, as John put it. The Beatles just did twenty takes of everything. So by the end of January 1969, an astonishing twenty-nine hours of tape had been filled, too much to bother mixing, so it was shelved, and the tapes given to recording engineer Glyn Johns to mix. So even Johns got tired of doing it and put it back on the shelf, both him and the Beatles intending it to be on the shelf forever. <br />Even if they had done this, it most likely would have surfaced in the ANTHOLOGY-era releases.<br />LET IT BE was released in May 1970, and before that, John, George, and Ringo hired the famous &quot;wall of sound&quot; inventor Phil Spector to remix the tapes and add orchestration to several songs. All the rest of the cuts were live in the studio, the intention of the GET BACK album.<br />Those songs that recieved overdubs and added noises were &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; &quot;I Me Mine,&quot; &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; and the album's title track. <br />Out of the five, the only one that really benefitted from such treatment was the beautiful, poetic &quot;Across the Universe.&quot; The harp, strings, and choirs give it a wonderful, dreamy feeling. However, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; is an entirely different ball game. The version of this song on ANTHOLOGY 3 is much better. The strings and choirs make it a sappy ballad, rather than a sad Beatles song that it was supposed to be.<br />Phil Spector's treatment of the title track isn't as great as the single version, mainly because the horns he added sound inappropriate to be so far forward in the mix. Some un-needed percussion is also present near the end, but the overall song, however, is a timeless piece with a great melody and Paul's best lyrics. &quot;I Me Mine,&quot; which also recieved strings and choirs, is interesting to see with them, but since they are considerably far back in the mix, the song isn't that bad. <br />LET IT BE's live in the studio cuts consist mostly of rockers, the best being &quot;Get Back,&quot; a classic McCartney rocker with an instantly memorable melody and fun lyrics. &quot;I've Got a Feeling,&quot; one of the last Lennon-McCartney writing efforts together, chronicles McCartney's lighter side along with Lennon's hard times of the previous year in which he left his son and divorced his wife; &quot;One After 909&quot; is one of the earliest Lennon &amp; McCartney efforts (although the version recorded in 1963 on ANTHOLOGY 1 is better); and John's &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; combines silly lyrics with catchy guitar riffs and a great melody. &quot;Two of Us&quot; is very folky, and it's one of the only Lennon &amp; McCartney duets out there, in the style of the Everly Brothers in terms of singing.<br />As of any Beatles album, there's a few stinkers, and the two tracks surrounding &quot;Let It Be&quot; (&quot;Dig It,&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;) are merely leftovers from the recording session mysteriously thrown in. Thankfully, they last less than a minute. George's &quot;For You Blue&quot; is a pretty sloppy 12-bar blues song. The one on ANTHOLOGY 3 is better.<br />LET IT BE is flawed, but that does not mean it is a worthless record. In fact, it's far from it. The album is unlike anything in the Beatles' catalog, or anyone else's catalog. Its sheer individuality makes it stand it up to the tests of time.
B00003CXE7|5.0|when i first saw this movie in theaters, i was dazzled.  i knew it would capture the Best Picture award in the Oscars, and i was right!  a winner of 5 Academy Awards in cluding Best Picture for 2000, Ridley Scott's &quot;Gladiator&quot; is truly a masterpiece.<BR>  set in about 300 A.D., &quot;Gladiator&quot; tells the tale of Maximus (Russel Crowe), a victorious Roman geneneral returning from the battlefield to his peaceful, loving home.  he is obviously very special and loved, because the sickly Emperor Marcus wants Maximus to be the next ruler of Rome.  <BR>  but trouble arises when Commodus, Marcus's evil son, murders his father, then blames Maximus.  he sends soldiers to execute Maximus and orders his family killed.  Maximus, being a skilled fighter, escapes his killers and flees to warn his young wife and son, but he is too late - Commodus' troops have horribly slayed them.  Maximus weeps and blacks out.  <BR>  when he awakens he is a common slave.  his master forces him to become a gladiator, but then we find out that his masters may not be the cruel man we take him to be.  Maximus makes friends with the other gladiators and sets out on a personal quest to avange his murdered family.  he doesn't mind if he dies, because he will be with them.  <BR>  with beautiful directing, acting, cinematography, special effects, and costume design, &quot;Gladiator&quot; is truly a winner in all respects - forever destined to become a classic.

0792156684|4.0|ok, &quot;Titanic&quot; is a good movie.  but winning 11 Academy Awards?  i don't think so.  if i were the Oscar people, i would give it maybe 5 or 6.  <BR>  the plot is pretty simple: a rich girl falling in love with a poor guy.  their torrid affair has only one obsticle: the ship they're in love on is sinking.  <BR>  while being a bit too long, &quot;Titanic&quot; is historically accurate and truly a winner.  it's a box office giant, andf let me say that i was very impressed when i saw it in the theaters.  i own the DVD, and my girlfriend and i watch it often, although i am tired of it.  it's one of those movies that you see once, like it, but never want to see it again.  <BR>  here's the bottom line: &quot;Titanic&quot; is a very good movie, but it is flawed.  once, it's a bit mushy and too focused around the lovers.  two, it can be boring at times and is a littel too long.  but if you're looking for a good love story, look no further than &quot;Titanic&quot;  director James Cameron does it again.  the special effects are superb, and James Horner's music is fabulous.  rent &quot;Titanic&quot; and see it for yourself!

0451527712|5.0|....and read this, one of the all-time greats, both in its style and its story.<br />Young Victor Frankenstein regards himself as an alchemist, a searcher after the secrets of life.  Like many idealists, he is willing to go to great lengths to realize his dream.<br />Unfortunately, and again like many idealists, he forgets that, being human, he too has a dark side, and unless one comes to terms with it, it's liable to show up right in one's face one day...<br />Some of the most moving passages herein come from the &quot;monster,&quot; who is poignantly eloquent about how he feels about being lonely and homeless and abandoned by his creator.  Even so, Victor will not hear him, and therein begins the tragedy--for what we will not hear will raise its voice until we're forced to.<br />&quot;You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may direct you if you succeed in your understanding, and console you in case of failure.&quot; -- V. Frankenstein
0807282375|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy, which made The Amber Spyglass that much more of a disappointment. The whole work seemed slapped together, as if the author had no idea what was going to happen next when he ended The Subtle Knife. Some major plot elements are handled quite sloppily: the notion of having the armored bears move to the Himalayas merely because there is ice there is evidently as foolish to Pullman as it was to me, since he has them move back to the Arctic after King Iorek fulfills his critical role in the plot. The assassin sent after Mary Malone is foiled in a way that is curiously unsatisfying. Mrs. Coulter displays some sort of magical ability at a crucial moment that is never explained. Will's father acquires secret knowledge of a plot worlds away that is explained by simply saying &quot;I'm a shaman, I see things.&quot; Steel is forged in circumstances that are more unbelievable than magical. And the tragic ending is so drawn out that rather than being bittersweet it is excruciating.<br />I also seem to remember Pullman's writing style being more solid in the previous books, but maybe that was just because I was enjoying them more. In this book the viewpoint jumps willy-nilly from character to character without warning, and we are continually told what characters are saying rather than listening to them in dialog.<br />These things didn't ruin the book for me. What ruined the book was being suddenly and without warning in either previous book being dropped into a diatribe against Christianity. I didn't feel that my beliefs were being questioned so much as being made responsible for all the evil in the world. No attempt is made to place any religious characters in a favorable light: they are unremittingly portrayed as either wicked or cowardly.<br />One other caveat: there is quite a bit of not-too-subtle sexuality in this book, more than I'm comfortable letting my ten-year-old son read.<br />Notwithstanding, the cast of the unabridged audiobook did a fine job. No complaints there at all.<br />My final recommendation is that you read the first two books of His Dark Materials (why are they called that? I still don't know) and make up an ending of your own. It will be more satisfying.ed audiobook did a fine job. No complaints there at all.<BR>My final recommendation is that you read the first two books of His Dark Materials (why are they called that?

0060278234|5.0|I just read Sabriel and couldn't believe how much I loved it. Then I discovered to my suprise that a sequel had been written. This sequel being Lirael. I have read this book and let me tell you, it's amazing. <br />This book reads like real life, Nix has created such a deep and believable world that you come to the illusion that the action is truly taking place. His characters are sooo believable and well developed.<br />If you enjoyed Sabriel there is absolutely no reason for you not to read this book. I personally enjoyed it just as much as its successor and I await non-patiently for the final book of the series &quot;Abhorsen&quot;. <br />The way this book builds is amazing and I know that all will love it. Sit down and read it, but not if you are going to be having to leave the house any time within the next 2 hours because..you'll never put it down.
0380002930|5.0|When I first heard of Watership Down, it was from a friend who read it in school. When I read it in 6th grade. I LOVED THIS BOOK. I love it now. Watership Down is the best book that I have ever read. I reccomend it to everyone who likes adventure, comfort, animals, mystery, and everything else that makes up a good book. the only bad thing I have to accociate with Watership Down is the movie. I DO NOT reccomend the movie. All in all, though, my experience with Watership Down is a great one.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is my all time favorite film. I have always loved this movie ever since the day I saw it in the theatres! Now that I have the Special Edition DVD, I can see how it was all done! This is a wonderful film with wonderful performances and a great cast! You couldn't find a better actor than Tom Hanks. I love all of the characters in this movie. I feel like I know em all! There are many memorable moments in this film and they will never be forgotten! I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I also have the soundtrack and it is also great. <br />The Special Edition DVD is awesome. The second disc is the one which holds most of the special features. You get to see the screen tests of Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the kids that played Forrest and Jenny as children, deleted scenes, a making of feature, and much, much more! One of THE BEST DVD's in my collection. <br />For any fan of this great film, this DVD is a must. This movie will always be the best!

0780625129|5.0|This movie was one of the most moving films that I have ever seen! It was a hard hitting, no holds barred drama about a former skinhead trying to turn his life around after three years spent in prison for murder. I believe that this is a movie that  most people should see because of it's extremely powerful portrayal of racism and the consequences of racism. Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, and the rest of the cast give wonderful performances. This film should have been nominated for more Oscars! <br />This is a great film, but one thing is for sure: it is not for the everyone. Please take strong caution before you see this movie. The profanity level is extreme, but it is typical of the environment the characters live in. I can't see how you could accuratly portray this without the excessive profanity. Although I can't stand tons of profanity, I tolerated it in this movie because of the strong subject matter that it dealt with. There was also a rape scene which was graphic and very disturbing, and one strong sexual scene at the beggining. There was graphic violence and lots of blood, but it is also accurate to the subject of the film. <br />This movie portrays the redemption of a man who thought he had screwed his life up forever. It is absolutly beautiful to see him try to change his life, and the lives of others, particularly his brother. People need to see this film. I loved it, and will add it to my collection of films.
B00003CXSP|5.0|This DVD is awesome!  I didn't get to see the movie in theatres, this was my first viewing of HANNIBAL.  Hannibal is not meant to be a sequal to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  It is designed to be an independent story - same characters, different storyline.  The special features on the DVD are a highlight: Alternate endings, deleted scenes, trailers and TV spots (and there are many!), a feature length commentary with director, Scott, a five angle breakdown of an action scene, many poster concepts, the list goes on.  Another plus is the disc is in widescreen format and DTS ready.  Great job, MGM!

It reads like a cool glass of gatorade on a hot day.  Les Liaisons is an epistilary novel which means it is written as a series of letters.  De Laclos manages to become each of his characters with such depth and sincerity...wow.<br />Read this book.   Infact, I'm bumping it to five stars.<br />By they way, Cruel Intentions may be based on Les Liaisons  but except for the girl on girl action  it is complete garbage.

B000000I0Q|4.0|In May 1975, Peter Gabriel performed his last gig with Genesis (at Besancon in France, if you need to know).  A month later, Steve Hackett marched into the Kingsway studios with a few chums and relatives to begin laying down tracks.  VotA would be the first Genesis solo album, beating even Antony Phillips to it, despite his leaving the band in 1970.<br />Although Hackett had Messrs Collins and Rutherford on board, the material written for VotA was a pastiche of much that Genesis stood for.  For instance, 'Ace of Wands', the opening track, compresses several unrelated riffs, key and time signature changes into a ridiculous spoof prog-rock tune that Genesis, Yes, or PFM would have been proud of.  The frequent use of tubular bells and occasional employment of Mike Oldfield's sister (not wife), Sally, hint at another of Hackett's satirical targets.<br />The lyrics take the mickey out of schoolboy nature-mystical poems.  As befits an ex-public schoolboy who hid behind thick spectacles for 25 years, the words make no connection with the common man.<br />The technical standard of the art on Genesis LP covers was never high (until SELLING ENGLAND), but on VotA it reaches its nadir, and deliberately so.  Heads are stuck on shoulders at unrealistic angles.  Hands are appallingly unrealistic.  (The inner picture is based on Painshill Park, Cobham, UK, by the way.)<br />Hackett must have been holding these compositions back for a number of years, as they are much more FOXTROT and SELLING ENGLAND than LAMB LIES DOWN.  Actually, once you get past the  joke -- and it quickly wears thin -- much of the music on this album is enjoyable.  And it's also the first on which Percy Jones and Phil Collins play together, prior to their outing with Brand X.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool overrated? Not possible. In a world of the music scene being the way it is, and probably will stay, it's conforting to know that there are still bands like Tool. Seeing all our idols (yes even the &quot;rock gods&quot;) selling their souls to make every penny they can so maybe they can open up their music to everyone, or even worse they could be Aerosmith. Yes Tool is definately conforting. <BR>This cd rivals Undertow, for 2nd next to Aenima. No, there is no rapping, or catchy hooks, or any gimmick. Their music is like a jam session with a start and an end, the middle is wide open. With so many egotistical lead singers who can't let the band just PLAY without jumping in with lyrics, it feels good to hear four minutes of just guitars, bass, and drums. Maynard easily has the greatest voice is the whole genre, and his voice is continually trying to be copied by other bands, much like Eddie Vedders was in the early nineties. Every song has many forms, and changes making one song feel like two or three. I won't get into all the small minute complex parts of every song, listen you'll hear for yourself. This cd has many high points, such as Parabol, Parabola, The Patient, Ticks and Leeches, but the best is definately Disposition. Its lyrics are so simple, something like 3 or 4 phrases, but leaves so much to the imagination and interpretation. The rest of the song, musically, is simple as well, and is probably why I like it so much. Beauty in simplicity.<BR>The final thought is that of another reviewers comments. Tool is NOT in ANYWAY connected to MTV. Never once have I heard Carson mention their names nor have I seen Tool appear on TRL. Too many people have a paranoia that every band will sell out. Well not every band has souled out(get it?). Fugazi hasn't, The Melvins haven't, and Tool will not!

0671578855|4.0|One of the tricks in a comedy of errors is to compound problems.  You start with something small and then see how you can make it worse.  Bujold does this excellently.  One such example is Miles's dinner party.<br />I do not agree with some reviewers that Bujold is misandrystic.  Aral Vorkosigan is anything but a bumbling fool who needs to be saved by strong women, nor is Simon Illyan, nor was Admiral Sung of the Dendarii, who helped educate and mentor Miles into a competent military leader.  <br />But young men *are* bumbling.  And Miles is... Miles.  He's a hyperkinetic force of nature with a mind to match, and it is not so much that he needs a woman to take him in hand, he merely needs a more grounded counterpart whose strengths complement his own rather than competing with them.  And by force of his personality, he has had to find someone with the strength of character to be able to be his equal, not his subordinate.<br />For example, he may have had an infatuation for Elena Bothari Jesek, but their history from childhood was that she and Ivan Vorpatril followed Miles's lead.  Elli Quinn, Sgt. Taura... great women, but never in Miles's league.  It was not until Ekaterin Vorsoisson that Miles had really met a challenge he could not scheme his way through.<br />The true magic of this novel is that for once Miles's enemy is not a clear-cut, tangible opponent.  His enemy is his having to adapt from a life of command that began as a teenager to a more civilian life.  Though politics is offered by Bujold as a replacement for the military as an outlet for his scheming mind.  The rest of his life cannot operate in the same way and his challenge is not to pull off a grand military operation, but to adapt to his new circumstances as his father's voice in the council and to trying to woo a woman he cannot command.<br />In a way, at 30 years old, he is finally having to become a &quot;man.&quot;<br />I have enjoyed this book and have Bujold's next Miles book on pre-order.
B000003H2W|5.0|This album contians some of the most beautifully produced aspects of sadness, and beauty. The music is quite different than any MDB album to date, as it is more subtle; less focuses on metal-oriented riffs and perhaps their most &quot;doomy&quot; one.<BR>The atmosphere on this album means alot to me, and every note taken from this piece seems to be divine and bond to your emotions as much as music could do.<BR>This is pure apocalyptic perfection, and I advice you to experience it, if you are worthy.
B000001EQT|4.0|1972 sah ich das erste Mal als Kind im Kaufhof bewußt ausgestellte LP-Covers. Die Gestaltung der mehrfache aufgehängten &quot;Slider&quot;LP finde ich so gelungen, daß ich den ersten Eindruck heute noch erinnere. Die verschwommene androgyne Büste weckt Erinnerungen an eine längst vergessene Kunstepoche (vor dem ersten Weltkrieg) und läßt dem Betrachter seine Phantasie freien Lauf, was er da denn für ein Wesen sehe. Ein origineller Schachzug , der die Platte ein expressives Gesamtkunstwerk werden lies. <br />&quot;Telegram Sam&quot; ist einer der besten T.Rex -Tracks überhaupt (finde ich). Klingt far out und surreal.  Jedenfalls eine Nr. 1 (wie die Single Metal Guru) in den deutschen oder britischen Charts gewesen. In diesem euphorischen  Single-Sog  des Frühjahrs 72 kam im Sommer 72 &quot;Slider&quot; heraus. <br />Es sind auch ruhigere Kompositionen mit introvertierten Texten zu finden und akustischer Gitarre. Damals zielte es auf den Teenie-Markt ab, doch in späteren  Dekaden wurde das Werk mit nachträglicher  Aufmerksamkeit gewidmet (T.Rex haben sehr viele Internetseiten). <br />Auf der Platte wirkten berühmte Gastmusiker wie Ringo Starr (der von T.Rex kurzzeitig große Stücke hielt), David Bowie (damals noch nicht so erfolgreich wie sein Schulfreund Marc), Sänger und Saxophonisten von Frank Zappa und andere mit. <br />Gut kommen auch die Bonus Tracks:  &quot;Lady&quot; war die wehmütig-heulende B-Seite der &quot;Metal Guru&quot; Single. &quot;Thunderwings&quot; ist ziemlich heavy für die Hitparade. <BR>Man merkt einen Wandel in der Musik. &quot;Slider&quot; ist perfekt produziert und hat recht gute surreale Kompositionen, doch irgendwie  anders wie &quot;Electric Warrior&quot;. Die Assoziationen an &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot; verschwinden. In diesem schönen Zeitschnappschuß um Mai/Juli 1972, da ist diese Musik noch neu und schön, erfolgreich. Doch bald wird es nie mehr so sein, Marc wird bald langsam größenwahnsinnig  werden und verliertden Blick über sein Publikum,  er wird nie mehr so gute  Kompositionen schreiben werden wie &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; oder &quot;By the lights of a magical moon&quot; ... <br />So seltsame Texte, die dramatisch klangen  (und zu Millionen über die Ladentische gingen) gab es seitdem nie mehr wieder. &quot;Slider&quot; ist mit &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; von 1971 das beste und erfolgreichste aus der schier unglaublich populären kurzen Kinder-Star Karriere von Marc. Aus der Underground-Zeit empfehle ich &quot;Unicorn&quot; und &quot;A Beard of Stars&quot; mit ähnlich sinnlich schönen Covergestaltungen und akustischer Musik. Rationell mit Geschreibsel wie diesem kommt man dem Phänomen schwer auf die Spur. Besser läßt man sich in eine Zeitmaschine nach 1971/72 mit dem Bewußtsein eines 10-jährigen Kindes katapultieren. Ich würde mich freuen, wenn eines Tages die schöneren Bilder von Marc Bolan wieder als Ölgemälde/Poster herauskommen.  Warum waren T.Rex damals in den USA nicht erfolgreich?   heute haben T.Rex in den USA viel mehr nette  Rezensionen als bei Amazon.de oder .uk! <br />Mit freundlichen Grüßen  Thomas Richter
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt was a memoir of his childhood and teenage years. it took place in Ireland, where he grew up in poverty with his mom dad and siblings. His father was an alcoholic, his mother couldn't work. He grew up with four brothers and one sister, many in which died. Overall the book was interesting to read because it gave you look at a different way of life, but we feel it was very redundant in this way of life. This book allows you to enter a totally different world. A world that makes you appreciate what you have, when you see how others appreciate what little they have. It was interesting to see the way Frank handle each situation that he faced when he was a child, and as a teenager. He had to be more mature than most children should be. But growing up the way he did, made him into a stronger person as an adult.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Another Dream Theater live album???  You think we were all dreaming, but that turned out to not be the case.  After the release of &quot;Once In A Livetime,&quot; the boys turn around and release this gem.  After a temporary delay, this album was released.  When I first heard it I was blown away!  I've been playing it non-stop, and can't help to wonder what it would have been like to be there on that wonderful night they peformed.  Imagine....Dream Theater, and only Dream Theater, on the stage for an amazing three-hours!  The set-list is the best part...they play Metropolis II from start to finish, with &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; and a few other hits thrown in too.  Words can't simply describe this album.  It is just is a must have for anybody.  Simply put, this album is a Dream Theater fans Dream come true.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I have been reading reviews since this movie came out in theaters and it seems to me that most people who did not like the movie simply did not understand it.  The whole movie really was about Palpatine and his rise to power.  It is pretty much a political movie wrapped up in allot of eye candy.  It is about Palpatines manipulations to rise to power and the re-emergence of the Sith.  All the other stuff is allot of window dressing and just plain fun.  Remember Star Wars is about sites and sounds new places exciting visuals.  Enough of my rambling though and on to the DVD this has got to be my new reference title for DVD.  I have heard actually quite a few complaints about how there is no DTS version of this movie, nor will there ever be.  George Lucas decided that Dolby Digital when done correctly could be every bit as good as DTS.  So he settled on Dolby Digital and decided not to take up valuable space on the disc with a second surround format.  The sould is absolutely incredible it is crystal clear and I've compared it to some of my best DTS discs and it is in every way as good if not better.  The whole mix is immersive and seems to just pull you into another world if only for a little while, and the video is absolutely crystal clear without a hint of graininess or distortion this is the way the movie was meant to sound I think it actually sounds even better than it did in the theater.  And of course the extras are worth the price of the disc alone with all the optimization features and such would cost you 20.00 alone just for those features.  I have found my new reference disc and it is going to take a long time for anyone to top this disc I think that we have seen the new standard for DVD releases.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I recently received my copy of the Phantom Menace DVD and am quite pleased with it.  I must say that the sound quality of the DVD is really quite amazing.  The sound and picture quality and special effects alone are worth the price of the DVD.<br />Despite the strengths of the special effects, I must say that the script and the acting are extremely weak at times during the movie.  For example, little 5-year-old Anakin Skywalker hits on the Princess at many times during the movie.  Those scenes are extremely unrealistic.  I just find it really hard to believe that little brat would flirt that much with the adult princess.<br />Also, Anakin Skywalker simply cannot act.  That boy basically reads his lines without much emotion.  I think that the little kid from the 6th Sense would have played a much better Anakin Skywalker.<br />What genius decided that it would be a good idea to have JarJar Binks in almost every scene?  I do understand that JarJar is supposed to provide comic relief.  However, JarJar is not funny at all - he's just really annoying.<br />And what's the deal with the Jedi blood test?  Why could they do this at the time of the first episode, but not at any time during episodes 4-6?  Was the technology simply lost?  It doesn't make any sense to me.<br />However, despite the script and acting weaknesses, the film is still much better than most of the movies churned out by Hollywood today.
B000002WU9|5.0|When I think of a bangin Wu solo album, this is one of them that comes to mind.  Not one song on this album do I want so skip.  Knucklheadz is a great way to start off this album of classic Wu songs.  Both Rae and Ghost are on point on this album.  Incarcerated Scarfaces is one of my favorite songs.  Nas comes to drop his darts on Verbal Intercourse, and this was back when he was Nasty Nas and he lives up to it with his verse.  Rza is on point as usual with this banga.  Wu-Gambinos is a hot song and Guilottine Swordz w/ Ins and Gza come correct with some hot verses.  The remix of All So Simple is one of the more soulful tracks bringin back the beat from the classic off 36 Chambers.  Rainy Dayz is a treat.  I can go on and on, instead of me just tellin you how hot this album still is, how bout you go and buy it, trust me it's worth more than you pay for.
B000021YQV|5.0|I bought this CD and now own two copies.  The reason is that i have already worn lines in my first copy rendering my disc useless. This is easily the best alblum of the last three years, and I listen to a lot of music everything from Adema to zepplin[a to z] and honestly this record is an instant classic.  Serj is a very talented man because he has a vision and scope which transgresses barriers of music.  Now as far as the classification of this  music, most people consider this metal but I consider it art rock, now hear me out. This record dosn't need to be grouped with the likes of slipknot and staind who we may eventually only remember the hit singles from.  System has made an alblum that every song is memorable and for that fact they could very well be the next Beetles popularity wise but because some people do not like dramatic music or distorted guitar they will probably never be that big.  Despite all this I reccomend this record to everyone, it has got a lot of great lyrics that are positive and descriptive of our society.  Also as to the review that mentions that this is a political band, that is only partially true because even serj and malkian have both said that only a few songs are heavily political. So I tell you to buy this and really listen to the lyrics and eventually the music will satisfy you on a level that you can only begin to imagine.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Genuis/Gza is one of my favorite emcees.  He's a great underground emcee.  Reps hip hop in every line.  Now what to say about one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time?  Every song is superb.  Can't be a fan of Wu and not own this album.  Rza greatest venture on the boards and Gza's flow and lyrics just make this masterpiece well .. a masterpiece!!  Every song is hot, I espcially like Liquid Swordz and Labels.

B00000K0T8|4.0|Ghostface's first solo album feat. two of my other fav emcees with Rae and Cappa.  With a team like that how can you go wrong?  In my opinion not as strong as Only Built... but still a great album, nevermind a great Wu album.  I rembmer when All That I Got dropped I was stunned.  Ghost paints such a vivd picture of how he grew up and gave us a glimpse into his life.  Also with such great Wu songs as Winter Warz, Daytona 500, Camay, Assassination Day, Iron Maiden, and Marvel, this album is definatly worth your money.  You can see the evolution of Ghost into one of today's best emcees with his slang verses.  To the untrained fan you might be guessin at what he's sayin, but to the veteran of Wu, y'all know exactly what he's sayin .. BUY IT
0783243499|3.0|Patrick Bateman is a child of the rich 60's.  We see him first as a succesful businessman on Wall Street where he works.  He and his friends are rich, can eat where they like, live where they like, and go out with who they like.  For some this was the 80's for most it would have been enough.  Patrick hwever needs more.  He spirals into a pit of violent and sexual depravity from which there is no return.  If you like black humour and thought Fight Club was thought provoking then this is definitely a film that will have you laying awake at night trying to work out where he and perhaps society went wrong.

0380002930|5.0|This book is a true classic, back when authors actually meant what they wrote. Most people judge this book by looking at it, I admit I also thought it was not worth reading at first. This book's main plot was how a handful of rabbits escaped from their warren because one of the rabbits in the warren predicted that disaster would destroy the warren. Even though its a little dull at times, if you keep on reading you'll be glad you kept on going.

068484267X|5.0|\\"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood\\".  This quote is from Frank McCourt's memoir, Angela's Ashes.  The constant theme throughout the entire memoir is the suffering McCourt went though during his childhood. <BR> Frank McCourt was born in New York, and grew up in the slums of Limerick, Ireland.  As he takes you through the memories of his childhood, the suffering at times is hard to believe.  McCourt and his family lived with hardly any food or clothing, due to the pure laziness of McCourt's alcoholic father.  And when you believe that things can't get any worse for the family, they do.  Countless deaths, many illnesses, taunting school children, and small triumphs, all color the book and its many pages. <BR>McCourt uses descriptions that put vibrant images in your head of his keen memory of his childhood.  You can almost feel his hunger pains at times.  When the slightest happiness occurs, you are there to feel the joy.  Although the book is saddening, McCourt makes light of even the darkest of situations with his subtle humor.  <BR> His great ability to retain all of his life memories is truly remarkable; yet his childhood seems to the utmost extreme.  We formed a sense of compassion for his family's mishaps, but some scenes leave us disturbed.  With the repetitive deaths, illnesses, and poverty factors, we feel that tends to bore us.  Overall it is a descriptive and valid piece of history.  <BR> We find this memoir to be one of the best pieces of literature we have ever read.  Filled with emotion and with undying attentiveness, McCourt has caught our eye and has kept us there, by his side, throughout the book.  His story illustrates a piece of world history that we must not forget, and it leaves us more thankful for what we have.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Say what you want about &quot;The Phantom Menace,&quot; but one cannot deny that the new DVD version is absolutely the best DVD package produced so far in the relatively short history of the medium. Lucas kept telling us he wanted to wait to do this on DVD until he could get it right, and he did.<br />What's so great about this DVD -- aside from the very good picture transfer and the perfect soundtrack -- is that it truly shows what it takes to make a movie of this magnitude from every stage and facet of production. There are 20 documentaries here -- yes, 20 -- capped off by an hour-long, narration-free video diary of the production that tells everything you need to know about why &quot;TPM&quot; turned out the way it did.<br />So why did &quot;TPM&quot; turn out the way it did? Well, it's simple: George Lucas expected too much from too many people in too short of a time. Luckily for him, many of those people delivered -- John Knoll and ILM, Ben Burtt on the sound design, and John Williams in particular. But George overlooked one thing, and that was simply the performances. The shoot was done in 13 weeks, and, as the docs show, he often only took 2 takes. This is with actors on stages covered floor-to-ceiling with blue screens, acting against sticks with ping pong balls on them for animator reference. George simply rushed the shooting of this film so that the techies could have more time to make it look and sound as jaw-dropping as it does.<br />And maybe that's okay. At heart, &quot;TPM&quot; is, after all, just a space opera, a movie that's supposed to make you ooh and ahh. And it does that. The visual effects are the best anyone's ever seen, sometimes purely because of how many of them there are. Damn near every shot in the film contains an effect of some kind, and the result is a picture so rich with visual detail that it really is quite impossible to take it all in.<br />Of course, the picture does have more than its share of flaws. Jake Lloyd. Jar Jar Binks (in performance only; the visual creation of Jar Jar amounts to a near-miracle). Natalie Portman's very lop-sided performance. So much going on that we get confused. Some directing mishaps.<br />But none of that really matters. What matters is that George Lucas simply proved with &quot;TPM&quot; that there are no more barriers in the visual effects world, nothing that cannot be done. As a technical achievement, &quot;TPM&quot; must rate among the greatest in the history of film; as drama, it must rate very low.<br />Thanks to this DVD, I understand why this is the case. And I thank them for putting it together. This is the definitive DVD, a veritable film school in a box.
0064471837|5.0|I'm surprised I haven't seen more reviews of the \\"this book is not for children!\\" variety here. I have to admit, I myself have been surprised to find this volume, and its companion, on the youth shelves. Some of the subject matter is quite grim, with a lot of death and dying, the loss of a loved parent and a teenager forced to become an adult far too quickly. Oh...on second thought, I really could have related to that from about eleven on!<br />18-year-old Sabriel has spent most of her life in the Kingdom of Ancelstierre, at a school just south of the wall that divides the south from the magical Old Kingdom in the north.  When she receives a strange message from her father, she knows she must go \\"across the wall\\" to discover her destiny.  The north turns out to be a lot more dangerous than she imagined or suspected:  There is no Royal Family holding it together and some evil force is calling the Dead into Life where they prey upon the living and make things alltogether unpleasant.  With the help of family familiar, Moggett, Sabriel must use her powers of necromancy to battle the evil and save the kingdom.<br />The writing is very stark and simple -- it took me only a couple hours to read _Sabriel_ -- but nonetheless clear and elegant. The magical system is truly unique;  I have never seen necromancy treated in quite this way before, if at all. The characters and situations are believable, and the juxtaposition of fantasy and dark realism is moving. The fantasy Britain of _Sabriel_ is a place where both Magic and Technology exist but never the twain shall meet and somehow the treatment of this old theme seems fresh rather than reconstituted.<br />_Sabriel_ is a really good book, but it's not for anyone who requires sweetness and light.  Though there is a levening of humour the overall tone is dark and the ending is ambiguous.  If you like Phillip Pullman or Neil Gaiman, you'll probably enjoy _Sabriel_.

B00003CX5P|4.0|First off to those out there who are surprised or disappointed that there is no DTS version. Three little letters can answer that THX. THX is Lucas own sound, why would he produce a DTS version when what he wants is more people using THX. It doesn't matter whether DTS is better or not. <BR>    The Phantom menace is still plauged by a poor script, poor directing and at times poor acting. The special FX are of an extremely high standard, as well as some new innovations.<BR>    The DVD etras are very cool and worth it. The movie isn't trash. It just is not as good as it should have been. The DVD is well worth the money. And a good edition to your DVD libary.
0198711905|5.0|The indispensible edition.  Others have longer prefaces; play-by-play editions even have erudite ones; and a handful have larger typeface.  But this is the full body of work in one readable, reliable and reputable volume.  If one were stranded on a desert island, this volume (and a suitable feminine companion) would suffice.

B00004U8JV|1.0|After seeing the original Jurassic Park (and reading the novel) I felt it was a pretty good action flick and made some needed concession to the book's length. Overall Spielberg was on-target with most of the film-to-novel choices and the effects were excellent.<br />Jurassic Park II is a total mess, mostly because el Spielbergo tossed Crichton's &quot;The Lost World&quot; novel out the window and just scammed the title. There are a few scenes ripped from the novel, but the story is not even on the same planet. If Jurassic Park II had followed the formula of the original (and at least used Crichton's basic premise for The Lost World) it would have been a far better movie.<br />And you just have to see the ending sequence to believe it. What was Spielberg smoking when he had a T-Rex running through a city like some bizarro King Kong? Taking the dinos off the island was a mistake of epic proportions and the whole ending sequence was ludicrous to say the least. Bad, bad, movie and I place this Spielberg effort right down there with 1941 or Hook. <br />If you want to experience a movie that is fun, action-packed and interesting (and actually has more elements of Crichton's The Lost World), buy Jurassic Park 3 when it becomes available.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|Okay, I was so excited about seeing this movie. For the most part, critical reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  I am also a huge fan of movies that are a little off the mainstream path.  Some of my favorites over the past few years are Being John Malkovich and Magnolia. I was almost certain, from the reviews I had heard, that Memento would join that list.  So, I hurriedly bought the DVD without having seen the movie. That was a mistake.<br />The movie plays backwards.  For example, if you divided the film into 20 scenes, traditionally scene 1 would play first, followed by scene 2, etc.  In Memento, Scene 20 plays first, followed by scene 19, then scene 18, etc.  This is definitely a unique style, and if it would have worked, I would have been thrilled with the technique.  Unfortunately, I don't think it is successful.  Just when a little Momentum begins to build, we are pulled from the story and thrown back in time.  The film could not hold my attention.  <br />More troubling, though, is that interspersed within the film are scenes that play in the correct chronological order.  This just adds to the confusion.  By the end of the film, I was frustrated and exhausted by trying to keep up with the plot (which I cannot help but think would have been extremely weak if played in the traditional chronological order)and was hoping the ending would shed some light on the muddling film.  Instead, the ending just left me asking &quot;What?&quot;  If Memento were a better film, I would attempt to watch it a second time to figure out some of the puzzles. But as it stands, I don't feel like watching this film again anytime soon. <br />I would reccommend that before purchasing the DVD you rent the movie first.  It could save you from disappointment. <br />NOTE: I really give the film 2.5 stars. It's has a story that is a little below average, but the unique presentation style is thoughtful and a welcome change to most Hollywood garbage. I just wish it could have been executed more effectively to lessen confusion and ambiguity.

B0000584V3|4.0|I positively *love* the band's first 3 records.  Still Life, while excellent, let me down.  Whether it's b/c it's less 'metal' than prior outings, or b/c of the different influences you can hear - it is definitely my least favorite.  Blackwater Park is an excellent followup, taking all the good points of Still Life and molding it into a fantastic record.<br />Any Opeth record deserves a 5/5 - (maybe not Still Life IMO), but compared to their first records, I only give this a 4.  It doesn't have that metal feeling that I love about the first few.  It *does* have the best production to date - amazing riffs and ends up a fantastic record.
B00005QXDD|4.0|Jack Black has an amazing flair for the (melo)dramatic.  The album is both humorous and musical.  Tenacious D manages to parody and at the same time pay homage to contemporary rock music.  It reminded me of when Frank Zappa was at his best in the 70's.  However, like Zappa, the dialogue can get a bit grating at times, but I've found repeat listenings are still very enjoyable.

0380789019|5.0|This book took a modern day Joe and led him down the rabbit hole into another world where there are other things scarier than taxi drivers.  Gaiman held my interests with some action, some humor, and some outstanding twists.  This book has been one of my favorites of all time and would recommend it to any reader with any imagination whatsoever.
0670880728|5.0|This book was smartly written in diary form which is a nice departure for a novel. It is at times a little outlandish, but the realism of Bridget's character keeps the book grounded. This is a book that you can't put down, and that keeps you laughing. This book is a must for any single woman who is still looking for Mr. Right and yet keeps getting Mr. Wrong. Read this one, you'll laugh.
B000006NPY|5.0|Billy Corgan had the daunting task to follow up his much hailed double set &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; that was seemingly so big it would take something even bigger to beat it. Thankfully Mr. Corgan and the Pumpkins decided to put the past behind them and give the world this delightfully low key outing that stands out in its non-Mellon Collie-ness. With the release of drummer-supreme Jimmy Chamberlain due to drug problems, Billy decided to shy away from that sound and instead add keyboard and synths sounds to creat a different Pumpkins album. The songs are smooth and sad, echoing Billy's life with the end of his marriage and the passing of his mother. While a commercial &quot;dissapointment&quot; (only when compared to its previous siblings) Adore is no less sonically stimulating. Especially since it is so different.
B00005LKIM|5.0|Ten years after the success of &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; psychiatrist, gentleman and cannibal Hannibal Lecter is back. I first saw this movie in a theater, and that's the way it should be seen. A big screen and good speakers are necessary to fully enjoy the greatness of this movie.<br />The career of director Ridley Scott is full of both highs and lows (&quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; being two of the highs; &quot;G.I. Jane and &quot;Gladiator&quot; being two of the lows in my opinion), but I would go as far as saying that &quot;Hannibal&quot; brings us Ridley Scott at his finest. From the almost poetic camerawork during Lecter's lecture on Dante to the careful use of slow-motion when needed, Scott shows that he is a world-class director.<br />Still, this movie would be nothing without the second-to-none acting of sir Anthony Hopkins. He really brings the novel's character to life, with all the finesse and charm one would expect from Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore is surprisingly good in her role as FBI-agent Clarice Starling. I have to confess I was a bit worried when I first learned that Jodie Foster would not play the role of Starling, but my fears were completely unfounded. Julianne Moore is just as good as - if not better than -  Jodie Foster was.<br />Other things deserving to be mentioned is the music of Hans Zimmer and the beautiful Italian scenery, both of them huge parts of this movie's appeal. Hannibal - approved.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|I believe this is the best concert of the Bee Gees that I have seen. The brothers Barry,Robin and Maurice Gibb are at their best singing 31 of their greatest hits before a sell out crowd at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA which is the entertainment capital of the world. To fully enjoy watching this concert video, one must have a DTS decoder on his amplifier. You can choose PCM stereo in the audio set up if you don't have a DTS decoder. The sound is incredible and awesome and it's like being there among the crowd since you can clearly hear the cheering and the clapping of the hands of the audience.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|As \\"Gone in Sixty Seconds\\" begins to unfold, it gives you one of two different options: you can either scrutinize its inane sense of logic, disinteresting plot, and lack of intriguing character development. Or, you can do what I did, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a ride it is. True, all of the above statements threaten to bog the movie down, but director Dominic Sena, teaming up with pyrotechnic-master Bruckheimer, fills the screen with some very high-speed action that is more intense than most might give it credit for. <br />Simplicity is all the rage in the story, which centers around Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage), a former car theft professional whose brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) is the latest target of a mobster who hired him to boost expensive cars. After a heist that went sour, he's out to kill Kip, but agrees to walk if Memphis can deliver 50 cars of various makes and models to him in three days. So, like any devoted and loving brother would do, he rounds up his former gang of car thieves and makes plans to boost the vehicles one night before the scheduled shipment. <br />That's all you really need to know, except for a few side stories involving a romantic past between Memphis and the lusty Sway (Angelina Jolie). The entire plot is predictable, beginning to end, reason being that since the movie is rated PG-13, we automatically know two things: a) nothing overtly violent will be taking place, and b) due to this lack of violence, nothing very shocking is going to be taking place. <br />But for the most part, the movie pays off with a lightweight amount of good-natured action setups that accomplish what they promise. There's the various escapes from the bumbling cops (including two detectives who appear to have come straight from a bad TV cop show), many of which provide us with some very intense chases as cars swerve in and out of traffic, dodge garbage trucks, crash into other cars, etc. Sena crowns this off with a very effective, if somewhat cheesy, finale in which Raines steals the car he could never control, and takes it for the ride we all dream of taking. <br />Thrown into the mix is a cast that appears to be having so much fun with the material that I almost felt left out when trying to pick the movie apart. Cage is back in the bad-boy form we have come to love him for, and is interaction with the delectable Jolie provide some very witty one-liners and even some awkward chemistry. Among the cast are Robert Duvall as a shady mechanic, and Ribisi in one of his less-appealing roles, but everyone seems to have high spirits, which helps the movie keep up a pretense of fun. <br />I'm not usually a sucker for schlocky thrills, but \\"Gone in Sixty Seconds\\" had me laughing and watching in all the right places. The title is a pretty good summation of its own plot, and though I found the film to be completely mindless, there's enough good, raunchy humor and more-than-mediocre action sequences to make up for its lack of intriguing story.
B00003CY0V|5.0|this movie was so good. i didnt expect john travolta to play such a character that he did and halle berry. but this movie is excellent. its about a terrorist who wants money and halle berry is his girl/partner in crime. it has a good plot, and worth every minute of your time. very action packed. i give it a A++
0393038912|5.0|loved this book, great short history of the world and several civilizations.  quick read, didn't want to put it down.  gets a little repetitive in the end, when he keeps applying the book's theory to several situations.  great introduction to several areas of history, biology, evolution, etc...
B00003CXXS|5.0|personally i thought that this was the best jurassic park that was made. the graphics was so good and the dinosaurs looked real and not mechanical. it was action from the very beginning and it was also humerous. i give it a A+
B00005M989|3.0|Great tunes, but if you want the complete story, check out his website - NPGMusicClub.com. His new album, &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot;, is on the way! And I haven't bought Invisible Mist's new album yet. So, gotta make a run to the store. Anyone want anything? Milk, eggs, tofu? Bye!
B00004Z459|5.0|I listesen to this cd at my friends house and  it has hot. Every single song had  its unique touch which keep to listening throughout.<br />This is unlike most cd's. With most you never listen to the last few tracks as they are dull and just fill up the space. But this had the best till last. I really didn't know how they chose the first siiingle to release as they are all amazing.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is gotta be one of the best cds that I've ever heard. I love it, Linkin Park Rocks. Linkin Park is one of the best new Rock bands I've heard. If your lookin for some really good rap/metal then I would strongly recommend getting this. Believe me this cd is worth buying cause every song on here is great. My favorites include: Papercut,One Step Closer,Crawling,In The End,Forgotton,With You,etc. Good Music like this should be played 24/7 on t.v and radio. Defiantly looking forward to the next album.
B00003CX5P|4.0|We all know what the flaws are in this film--a poor script, plot holes, annoying alien sidekicks, etc.--but this DVD goes a long way towards redeeming it. First, the print. Excellent transfer--the landscapes and visual effects leap out at you, and one can now really appreciate the sheer inventiveness of the special effects. The sound is also good, but--as another reviewer pointed out--there are better sound production techniques. Lucas usually goes state-of-the-art with everything he does; why not the best here? Still the sound isn't bad; one can FEEL the pod race as much as see it, and the landscape of Tattooine blends seamlessly with the pods and the various effects. Ben Burtt proves he's one of the best sound technicians around--every racer has a unique and--more importantly--appropriate engine sound (Check out the menacing noise of Sebulba's pod, for a good example--doesn't it seem to fit him?). Yes, the sound could be better, but it isn't bad. <br />Now, for the added scenes. They're confined to two segments--the pod race, and the arrival at Coruscant. The pod race scenes involve extra character introductions (unnecessary) and additional racing segments (excellent). The latter add some truly hair-raising moments to the already tense and exciting pod race, and are welcome. The scenes at Coruscant mostly involve Anakin and company traveling through the city. It's nice, and the effects look great, but it really adds nothing to the film. <br />Now, the extras. This is what makes the DVD one of the best produced to date. Each segment is carefully scripted and directed, with some real standout moments, plus a few revelations. Watch the &quot;3000 Anakins&quot; segment and realize that Jake Lloyd wasn't a bad selection after all. Even an average actor can be redeemed by a good director (see Jim Carrey in &quot;The Truman Show&quot;), but Lucas was probably so wrapped up in the technical aspects of the film that he seemed to forget that in the middle of this monstrousproduction was a small boy with minimal film experience. Perhaps that's why Lloyd sometimes seems a little apprehensive. Give the kid a break, folks. <br />Perhaps the only real disappointment came in the lack of actor commentary in the extras. Neeson's a great personality; I'd love to hear what he has to say about his experiences. But Lucas and company have loaded the second disc with everything else (and maybe the kitchen sink, too!). &quot;The Beginning,&quot; the documentary about the film's production, is absolutely first-rate. One may begin to believe that one of the reasons the film suffered from plot problems is that Lucas was so distracted by all of the various crises that seemed to pop up daily (remember--much of this was filmed in the Tunisian desert, where you should expect the unexpected). I'd seen the &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; video when the film was first released--excellent then, excellent now. The storyboards and animatics segments are nicely detailed and reveal how much work can go into a single scene. There are more extras--posters, trailers and teasers, plus the DVD-ROM features. They're all first-rate, as well. <br />The film has many flaws--but remember, Lucas made the original for a different audience. He called this film &quot;'Star Wars' for his kids,&quot; (a paraphrase) and it does have many redeeming moments: Does anyone else get chills at Palpatine's last statement to Anakin? The lightsaber duels are hyperkinetic, dynamic, and well-choreographed;  the pod race runs on pure adrenaline, even more so with the additional scenes; and the battle between the Gungans and the Trade Federation's robotic troops is stunning in its complexity and flawless effects. Can anyone find a flaw in the film's effects? I haven't. Great production design is also an asset. Jar Jar may annoy the heck out of most people, but he's still an amazing breakthrough in digital effects; same for Watto, who steals every scene he's in (&quot;Mind tricks don't work on me; only money!!&quot;). Ditto Ian McDiarmid; his Palpatine is an ambitious, manipulative political genius who oozes both charm and evil in the same breath. Not a great film, but still better than most of the cookie cutter movies Hollywood produces every year. To those who don't like it: Give it another chance. The second time I saw it in the theatre I was accompanied by a seven year old boy, and I enjoyed more than my first viewing. Those who are already fans will love this wonderful DVD treatment.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I'll keep this short because this box set can be described with just one word......AWESOME!!!  If you like British humor and love John Cleese, then get this set, you WILL NOT regret it!  Now if they would only release another CLASSIC British comedy series on DVD.  Can you guess what I'm referring to?  None other than, &quot;The Young Ones&quot;!!!  My life would be complete if they did a box set of that show.  Dare to dream.......
B000004286|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  It evokes all the emotions of the movie.  I listen to this a lot as I write.  One of my favorite tracks is &quot;The Legend Spreads&quot; and of course &quot;Freedom/The Execution/Bannockburn&quot; is wonderful, too.  The Main Title is also excellent.  I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys sweeping film scores and exciting, moving Celtic music.  Horner also did a great job with the soundtracks for Titanic (more Celtic influence) and Glory.
0448060191|5.0|I have read Little Women nearly annually since I was 8 years old.  The story never ceases to amaze me.  As a youngster, I related to the tomboy Jo.  As a new wife, I laughed out loud at Meg's attempts to make jam.  Although I know it is going to happen, I never fail to cry when Beth's &quot;tide goes out easily&quot;.  Now that loss has touched my life as an adult, the story becomes even more poignant.  I gave this book as a gift to my oldest &quot;little woman&quot; in the hopes she loves this book as much as me.
0812550706|5.0|I realize that some people didn't like this book; tastes vary.  But if you criticize it and say it's the worst book you've ever read, you obviously have a limited perspective (and you've never read The Song of Hiawatha).  If you want a realistic book, read nonfiction or realistic fiction.<BR>I don't read science fiction because it's plausible.  It isn't, but I read it because it's applicable to my life.  I seriously doubt anyone will ever write a story about a teenager who's really, really bored and never does anything but read, but science fiction, and especially Ender's Game, gives me hope.  Maybe, someday, I will get to do something interesting.<BR>I know the end of Ender's Game doesn't go into much detail and just skims over things, but that's why Mr. Card is writing the companion novels, to expand upon the ideas and and fill in the gaps.  Although Ender's Shadow takes place at the same time as Ender's Game, it is vastly different.  In fact, the main character of it, Bean, is barely mentioned in Ender's Game.<BR>Anybody who criticizes Ender's Game shouldn't be comparing it to Arthur C. Clark's books; it's not like they're particularily accurate, either.  The point of fiction is imagination.  If you want authors to churn out dull, dry facts, go read a textbook.<BR>Maybe I sound like the high school freshman I am to some people, but there had better not be anyone who claims my points aren't valid.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This dvd set is packed with special features on the second dvd.  I'm sure anyone with a high-end home theater will agree that the picture and sound are superb.<br />For those who don't like this movie:  Lucas has said the Star Wars films were made for children around &quot;13&quot; years old!  I have talked to many children who LOVE Jar Jar, so GET OVER IT!  <br />This movie is a feast for the eyes and ears!  The sets and landscapes are astounding.  The music is awesome, thanks to John Williams.<br />Keep up the great work George.  I'll be first in line for the next film!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|If you haven't seen Memento yet, Lord have mercy on your soul, run down to the video shop right now and rent a copy. This movie is truly unmissable. It has been highly praised by critics and audiences alike, and in general has Wowed the world. I mean, it even earned a place on the IMDb Top 10 (out of 250!) films of all time. That is pretty impressive. I can see exactly why the world loves the movie. It's different, exhilarating, amazingly engaging, original, smart, involving and endlessly entertaining. Memento is just everything you want out of a smart and fun movie. You truly get your money's worth with this one. Now, where should I start? Hmm, yes, Christopher Nolan. What a guy. He put his heart and soul into this movie and has come up with a true original. The script was actually adapted from a short story but extended to a film that seems so totally new and fresh you would never guess it had been adapted from anything. Christopher's direction is brilliant. He uses black and white for the unforgettable flashback scenes and colour for the scenes that are happening at that time. The film pretty goes backwards but is never confusing if you watch it carefully. Another great thing at the movie is Guy Pearce. He is one heck of a performer! While not only truly believable, he somehow possesses his character into amazing form. We never really know if Pearce is acting or not. There are plenty more great things about the movie. The editing is effective, especially within the first few minutes. The voice-overs help you to understand where the movie is taking itself. Carrie Anne-Moss's character is very intriguing. This movie is shocking, intriguing and truly unforgettable. If you haven't seen it by the time I've finished blabbing about how good it was, then you should get help. Preferably professional.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Blink-182 used to be my favorite band, until this cd came out. This CD is not punk rock, I don't know what it is. Even though all the preps say that they are punk, they are not. They are a bunch of sell-outs. I think that blinks cds are getting worse and so are the lyrics. If you want to listen to some real punk then go listen to Dropkick Murpheys, Rancid, Ataris, Less Than Jake, AFI, Millencolin, or Bad Religion.
B00005A1PR|4.0|I think that India is REAL. Like she says in her song, she doesn't need makeup, gucci, etc. This is a good album. I like it a lot
B0000062FL|1.0|how could the person(s) responsible for 5.1 surround mix screw up it up so bad? this was one of rocks greatist albums, now in 5.1 dts format it is a sad joke. i couldn't believe my ears! the tape hiss from the front right end of the mix is unexcusable. did the person remixing pretend it wasn't there? and what were they thinking adding the phase-shifter to Santana's guitar during the Black Magic Women outro? hey dont get me wrong, i'm one for dynamic surround effects, but this stuff is rediculious! the overall sound is thin and sometimes sounds like its coming from the next room. be warned this mix is awfull. the slick guitar feedback that segways into Oye Como Va was also tampered with. please Sony take another crack at this masterpiece.
B000002L7R|4.0|I think that Prince intentionally flipped the script. This was a Purple Rain follow up Flop for those who were looking for a Purple Rain Part2. I think that this album quickly showed how everchanging Prince can and will be for the duration of his career. This is not his best work. But Good.
B000000OXH|5.0|If you are one of the people who, like me, dismissed this as an anemic follow-up to ASIA, please Please go back and listen to this album with fresh ears. Steve Howe's accompaniment on these songs is phenomenal, and the brilliance is so subtle that I didn't hear it as a younger person in 1983. Playing scales can often be impersonal and cold, but Howe's sweeping use of scales with that muted, biting tone is some of the finest playing I've ever heard.<br />Also, listen to the acoustic fingerstyle in &quot;My Own Time&quot;. Few could have played those propulsive, loping arpeggios with as much beauty and precision as Howe.<br />The grace of &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; gives way to a soaring, absolutely majestic solo which comes stepping back down to earth with command.<br />The music, while more pop-oriented than ELP, Crimson or Yes, was still composed with imagination and joy, and the harmonies serve the songs well. Geoff Downes' keyboard work is flawless, but intertwines with Howe's guitar, and is likewise hidden, but there to be found.<br />Although I have many favorite guitar players, this album has affirmed to me that Steve Howe may well be remembered as the greatest who has ever lived.<br />Re-discover this album.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I thought the movie itself was a little disappointing, though it did have flashes of brilliance.  The DVD, though, has some nice features.  Particularly of note is a nice and long documentary about the making of star wars.  People who have seen a lot of DVD extras will probably attest to the fact that &quot;making of&quot; documentaries on dvds are usually 5 minute hype segments.  This is not.  This really gives you a feel of the work and effort put into the film, and makes you appreciate what being a director is like.  It has elevated my respect for this movie, and made me feel like it's worth more than people give it credit for.
B000003TA9|5.0|I think that Dirty is one of the most readily accessible of Sonic Youth's large catalog, and one of my most treasured. The whole cd has a flawless sound and lots and lots of the wonderful disjointed strange lyrics of the fabulous Kim Gordon. &quot;Orange Rolls, Angel Spit&quot; showcases her raw talent and quirky gloriousness.<br />&quot;100%&quot;, &quot;Wish Fulfillment&quot;, and my personal favorite &quot;Youth Against Facism&quot; are all just unforgettable and great tunes, rife with great guitar, and Thurston's mellow voice spiriting you away from the ordinary lame pop rock. <br />&quot;Swimsuit Issue&quot; is a great Kim song with such powerful antisexual harrasment lyrics as &quot;i'm just here for dictation, don't want to be a sensation, don't touch my breast, i'm just workin at the desk, don't put me to the test, i'm just doin my best&quot;. I don't know its hard to put into words the sheer coolness of this cd or Sonic Youth in general. Just buy it.
B00005NW02|5.0|Few cd's exceed my expectations and Systems new release &quot;Toxicity&quot; does that and more.  System has always had a style that was unique to them and it  blossoms with this disc.  From start to finish there is not a weak song and it gets better and better the more you listen to it.  A must buy for everyone!!!!!
6304196784|5.0|I got into Monty Python sometime around last year. I became sort of obsessed and I plan to someday see every movie and book that any of them made. A Fish Called Wanda was one of the movies I had to see. We rented it and I must have watched it 4 times in the first week of having it! Michael has always been one of  my favorite Pythons, but I knew John first because of Fawlty Towers that I watched with my sister on Comedy Central. Apart from the Monty Python movies, this has to be my favorite! I think they all did a great job on it! Next to see: Fierce Creatures.
6304698798|4.0|I'm not really a fan of Sergio Leone or the Western genre, but as a CW buff I find this film to be very impressive.<br />I've read that this movie was adapted from a short film Luciano Vincenzoni made about a group of guys stuck between the lines during WWI, Vincenzoni and Leone decided to adapt the story to the American Civil War and set it in the Far West.  You may think that the film's Civil War background is just a composite of generic vignettes, but the writers did base the film on an actual event from the Civil War.<br />The event is Sibley's New Mexico Campaign of 1861-1862, when a brigade of about 3,000 Confederates under the command of Henry Hopkins Sibley invaded the Union Territory of New Mexico from Texas.  The Confederates clashed with Union troops on several occasions, finally losing most of their supply wagons at the battle of La Glorietta Pass, which compelled the grey troops to retreat back to Texas, in a ragged, starving condition, closely pursued by the Federal forces under Col. Canby.<br />TGTBATU correctly portrays the seesawing nature of the campaign control of the territory passed between the two forces.  The setting in Spain also matches the landscapes of New Mexico and northwestern Texas.  The artillery, however, was borrowed from a Spanish museum and is not accurate to the period nor are the rear-loading versions of the Colt 1851 Navy revolvers.  Also, there were no railroads in New Mexico at the time.<br />Another error is made in the uniforms of the Confederate soldiers.  The film correctly reproduces the regulation jackets which are trimmed in yellow for cavalry, blue for infantry and red for artillery (however, it can be seen that all of the coats have plain brass buttons, unlike the originals which would have had insignia), but coats with the expensive trim were rarely seen even on the more important Eastern battlefields and the Confederate troops who fought with Sibley were probably equipped with little uniform clothing.  Also the regiments that fought with Sibley were all organized as mounted troops.<br />Another thing that impressed me about the film was the image of a group of individuals living in the &quot;No-Man's Land&quot; between the two armies.  Throughout the Civil War a motley collection of dispossessed civilians, prostitutes, escaped slaves, army deserters, spies, guerrillas and bandits prowled on the edges of the field armies.  These groups receive relatively little coverage in either history or fiction seeing as so little was recorded about them.<br />I found the presentation of a hypothetical group of these individuals as seen in TGTBATU to be highly intriguing.  The premise is that a national army is the supreme manifestation of LAW, and that when two armies, essentially two opposing forms of law are present, there will be a vacuum of lawlessness that fills the void between the two bodies- an ideal place for three men to be ruled by only their base instincts, be they Good, Bad or Ugly.<br />The DVD quality is good, and includes previously unreleased (in the US) scenes deleted from the original version of the film.  The dialogue in these scenes is in Italian (with English subtitles) and presents not only a few more bits of interest in understanding the central characters, but also a few more Civil War vignettes such as a shattered Confederate fort and hospital, as well as a Confederate camp.
B000058B2W|5.0|I'm not prepared to say &quot;Exotic Birds &amp; Fruit&quot; is the best Procol Harum album.  I will say that it's the one I've played the most over the years (on vinyl).  <BR>Great songs, great playing, great lyrics, great singing.  The production is a little &quot;thick&quot; but very listenable.<BR>&quot;The Idol&quot; tends to go on interminably, much like &quot;TV Caesar&quot; from their previous album Grand Hotel.  Hence, it's a song I tend to skip over, but it's the only one.<BR>&quot;New Lamps For Old&quot; is the perfect coda for the album; the drumming of B.J. Wilson is sublime, much like on the title track to the album Broken Barricades, an album I'm still waiting to see on CD.
B000002UDB|5.0|1967- when the hippie era was in its prime, and psychedelic music was at a high point.  Magical Mystery Tour is a very suitable soundtrack to represent this era, with psychedelic songs like Blue Jay Way, Flying,Strawberry Fields Forever, and, of course, I Am The Walrus.  On this album you'll also find the classics The Fool On The Hill, Your Mother Should Know, Hello Goodbye, Magical Mystery Tour, Penny Lane, Baby You're A Rich Man and All You Need Is Love. Magical Mystery Tour is an album that symbolises an era of peace and love, an era that won't be forgotten easily.
0316779237|3.0|If you've read David Sedaris's writing before, you will be familiar with the tone of Holidays on Ice.  In fact, if you've read Barrel Fever, you've read two of these stories already, and if you've read Naked, you've read one other.  Out of six, three new stories is barely a compelling reason to shell out the bucks for this slender volume.  For those not yet familiar with Sedaris's style, he writes cynical and witty short stories.  They are often autobiographical (unusually in this tome half the stories are clearly fictional) and at their best full of piercingly true and hilarious observations of human nature.  Sedaris spares no one, least of all himself, and so although there is nothing of an explicitly graphic sexual nature here, this isn't the book to give to sweet old aunt Betsy as a stocking-stuffer.  Sedaris is matter-of-fact about his homosexuality and his drug use, and similarly about the sexual side of American life.  &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore&quot;, for example, is an uncommon Christmas tale.  Conservative readers who find themselves offended by the irreverence of the title should stay away, not only from Holidays on Ice, but all of Sedaris's writing.  Unquestionably the first story in this collection is also the best. In &quot;SantaLand Diaries&quot;, his on-the-job expose of life as a Macy's elf, Sedaris's customary cynicism is tempered, albeit only slightly, by an occasional touch of sentimentality.  The final three stories go to extremes to avoid such influence, and suffer greatly for it.  I find myself wearied by such non-stop cynicism.  The jaded outlook of these last stories is not alleviated by the fact that they clearly seek to parody that very outlook.  In &quot;Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol&quot; a theatre critic roasts three children's Christmas pagents, concluding with the line &quot;Is it just them, or am I missing something?&quot;  Fair enough, although not especially funny or profound, but then this is the sole point of most of the book.  Sedaris often seems eager to embrace sentimentality, but afraid that in so doing he will not seem sufficiently cosmopolitan.  Taken individually these stories are fine, but not representative of the author at his best.  As a collection I was rather disappointed.  My recommendation--buy Barrel Fever, Naked, and Me Talk Pretty One Day, and skip this one.of the book.

If you're a Pet Shop Boys fan and you don't own this album, consider yourself seriously deprived. From the urban sounds of 'One More Chance' to the dance rhythm of 'Hit Music', this album will suit your every need. A must have for the eighties pop culture lover.

B00005OWEG|5.0|this film is a masterpiece of filmwork. the acting is superb, (we get to see a young lawrence fishbourne); the music is intense and adds tremendously to the craziness that vietnam was; the cinematography is outstanding, the coloring amazing; but all that pales in comparison to the attack on the village that sends chills up your spine watching, feeling the palpable attack, listening to wagner's ride of the walkeries in a way that you wouldn't expect from that wonderful piece of music, but fits so well. i can't say much bad about this film, i consider it to be the best vietnam war film ever, closely beating out platoon and full metal jacket, which are also up there. <br />also this film does well to relate to the book upon which it is losely based, heart of darkness. the intensity of both the book and the movie correlate well. i recommend to those who have seen the movie to read the book by joseph conrad and compare the two Kurtz characters. &quot;the horror! the horror&quot; will be very familiar.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This CD is one of the most amazing and talent-filled CDs ever produced. It is filled with emotional ballads and fun upbeat tunes.  The lyrics are genuine and the delivery flawless. Absolutely amazing!
B00003CY5J|4.0|Excellent heist film for the new millennium opens up with a deliciously cool mellow pace and then effectively tightens the screws for maximum tension in the last third. Robert De Niro is terrific as a tired, aging thief who wants to get out of the big-take business, retire with his girlfriend (an underused Angela Bassett) and run his gorgeous Montreal jazz club. Marlon Brando is energetic and memorable as the crime ring guru who insists De Niro does one more job before retiring: an ancient royal relic now in custody at the Montreal customs office. Not only is he pushed into doing this job, but De Niro is also faced with taking on a new partner (Edward Norton), who may not be as devoted to the team as he seems. Frank Oz directs with the perfect touch, the photography is absolutely breathtaking and the music (including an appearance by jazz star Cassandra Wilson) couldn't be better. A Must See!
0380973650|5.0|I like Gaiman's writing quite a lot and this is the first time I've seen his Sandman style of mixing massive myths with everyday life.  Great book.  Actually good enough that I bought the audiotape of AG for my wife and I to listen to on a long car trip.  Sooner or later, I'll get her into Sandman....
B00003CXSM|2.0|The biggest disappointment in this sparkling romantic comedy is that the story starts off with such a lively step and good humour, then gives in to sappy sentimentalism and weak plot movements in its conclusion. Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Lopez couldn't be better as star-crossed lovers who click on their first meeting. The trouble is that Lopez is a high-anxiety wedding planner with a utility belt strapped on her that would make Batman look unprepared, and her newest client (Bridgitte Wilson-Sampras) is engaged to McConaughey. Choreographer Adam Shankman makes an ill-advised directorial debut that is rife with technical errors (extras that stare right into the camera, sloppy editing among the many) and is completely unaware as to how uneven the apparantly unfinished script really is. That said, his talents as a dance director are obvious considering that the tango scene between the two leads is the film's best moment and one of the most enjoyable dance scenes in a Hollywood film of recent years. Wilson-Sampras and Judy Greer, two consistently working character actresses, are given their very best roles to date in this film and subsequently give excellent performances. Star power is the real winner here though, and the two gorgeous headliners will keep you wanting more until the very end. Not as good as My Best Friend's Wedding and yet oddly enough I enjoyed it more.
6304595247|5.0|I thought this portrayal of Wuthering Heights was incredible! I loved it! It was dark, it was mysterious, and Heathcliff was both maliciously cruel and passionately in love. I thought they could have developed Catherine's sadistically playful tormenting of him more, but for the most part, they did a great job!
B00003CXV4|4.0|For a Keanu Reeves movie this one actually has a lot of heart. Charlize Theron gives an excellent lead performance as a free-spirited young woman who unlocks the guarded heart of a cold and selfish advertising executive (Reeves), getting him to leave his job behind and awaken to his real emotions. She shows him the best parts of life and then goes all terminal illness on us--yup, we've all seen it a thousand times before. The spin here is that Theron's performance is so warmhearted that the lesser moments of the film (like all the scenes involving Liam Aiken, a poster child for planned parenthood if ever I've seen one) maybe won't be forgiven but at least they can be cheerfully ignored. Reeves' performance, unfortunately, is so very wooden even by his standards that his scenes without his leading lady will make you turn green (watch the part where he pitches an account to a hot dog company: it's the clearest case I've ever seen of an actor who has absolutely no idea what the scene is about).
6302719631|2.0|I actually didn't like the movie at all. It is the only Jane Austen adaptation in which I found nothing appealing. I usually can find parts that are effective, however, this movie was disappointing in every way. (The last scene is somewhat redeeming.) I would definitely recommend watching this movie BEFORE purchasing it. I bought it without watching it and it will do nothing but collect dust. It is the only Austen movie that I will NEVER watch again.
B00003CY0V|2.0|Sometimes exciting but for the most part predictable thriller about a world-class computer hacker (Hugh Jackman), who is recruited by a shady government spy (John Travolta) to break into a Los Angeles Bank and steal billions of dollars in unused government funds by cracking computer security codes. Halle Berry is the sexy vixen of a sidekick to Travolta who may or may not be on his side. Great performances all around, even for this genre of filmmaking, but the plot is mostly talk at the beginning, mundane plotting in the middle, a very exciting climax and an easily foreseen ending. Travolta definitely rescues himself from the hell he put himself into with Battlefield Earth and Lucky Numbers in 2000, but this one isn't near the level of quality that he struck with Get Shorty or Pulp Fiction. Berry has a large role but once again her talent is wasted in favour of gratuitous nudity and overemphasis on her character's potent but ultimately (in this script) useless sexual charisma. Jackman is very appealing both physically and emotionally, but between this performance and the one he gave in Someone Like You you're basically looking at the same character caught in two different circumstances.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Wonderful Saga set in Montana during WWI.  Beautiful love story that I watch at least once a week.  Beautifully filmed.  The chemistry between the characters make this a worth while movie even if the plot weren't as wonderful as it is.  Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, and Julia Ormond portray their characters exquisitely.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|Fiona Apple takes over the crown of best alternative female vocalist, after Kate Bush got on our nerves, Jane Sibery went country, sinead O'Connor went off the wall and Tori Amos got wierd and repetitive.<br />Apple's words are deep and her music is fantastic.  And it is the music that is important.<br />What is surprising is to see critics rave about her second album.  Usually, when critics discover an artist, they usually like to tear apart the second effort.
B000000WHX|3.0|I reserve 2 stars for albums I don't like at all, but this album is borderline. It's so dated! &quot;SO early 90's!&quot; (I hate people who say that, but in this case, it works.) Some of the songs sound like MIDI tracks, and with the cheesy vocals, wouldn't sound out of place on the PULSE compilation. Besides the rappers, who I wish had more air-time, the vocalists are very bland, and the only one with a distinctive voice is Annoying! (&quot;One Love&quot;). &quot;Safe From Harm,&quot; &quot;Blue Lines,&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; are decent to ok, but some of the songs sound like Weather Channel music. It ends on a really sour note, too, with &quot;Hymn of the Big Wheel&quot;.<br />The only other song of theirs I've heard is &quot;Angel,&quot; which I really like, so I presume their later albums are better, but I'm almost afraid to try them because of this one. <br />I'm sure this album was revolutionary at the time (and in that sense, I respect it alot), and maybe used cutting edge equipment (I don't see how), but it doesn't hold up today. It seems almost quaint. Go with the artists that these guys paved the way for, like Portishead and Tricky (though if you can tolerate Morcheeba, maybe this is for you [just kidding; I actually don't mind Morcheeba]), and perhaps their own later work. Come back to this only if you can't get enough, and you want to see where it all started.
B000002U82|5.0|This album came out of nowhere.  Prior to this album, Pink Floyd was a very good space rock group with a major cult following.  Part of the group's popularity was due to word of mouth on how good their concerts were, with elaborate lighting and surround sound.  But, the music was superficial, psychodelia without much to say.  The music was mostly fantastic, but sometimes uneven and boring.<br />Then came this album.   Everything about it is a milestone.  Pink Floyd had just switched album labels from Harvest to Columbia.  The record company put a lot of effort into the release of this album.  It had a slick cover, 2 posters and it's own prism label.<br />This is one of the best concept albums of all time.  The album, based loosely on the craziness of a rock tour, had a lot to say.  All tracks are fantastic.  There is a new maturity to the songs.  Instead of singing about flying to the sun or cutting up people, they are now singing about problems in society and the impacts on individuals.<br />Note that before this album was released, Pink Floyd experimented with the concept in concert.  They played a 40 minute set called &quot;Eclipsed&quot; that contained about half of the songs on this album.   The other part was some really nice space/jazz music. <br />After this album was released, Pink Floyd went on tour.  They stretched out Dark Side of the Moon to 60 minutes and included some fantastic musical interludes.  They also experimented with early versions Wish You Were Here and Animals.  During this tour, Sheep was called Raving and Drooling and Dogs was called You Got To Be Crazy.<br />As part of the Pink Floyd reunion tour in 1994, they played the complete Dark Side of the Moon to celebrate its 20th anniversary.  This live version is on the album Pulse.  It is a pretty poor version of Dark Side of the Moon and doesn't come close to matching the studio version or the live versions of the seventies.
B00004Z459|5.0|This c.d. is *awesome*!!! It has all different knds of songs and the music is just wonderful! ....Linkin Park is one of my FAVORITE bands!! ....THERE ALL SOOO HOTT and talented...I recormend that EVERYONE buys this c.d. cuz your ears have never heard anything so powerful and awesome!!! =) I hope that Linkin Park puts out another c.d.like this but it would be hard to top this c.d!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000024D4R|5.0|This is probably Pink Floyd's second best album.  In this album, Roger Waters equates people to different kinds of animals.  The songs have deep meaning.  The album contains one of my favorite lines:  &quot;You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to&quot;.<br />Musically, this Pink Floyd's heaviest album.  It is mostly guitar oriented.  The guitars are loud, up front and crashing.  The guitar finale at the end of Sheep is mesmerizing.  This is in contrast to Wish You Were Here, which is mostly a keyboard album. <br />The album only has 3 major songs (plus 2 short accoustic numbers).  The only negative one can say about it, is that all three songs have the same structure.  Each track starts out with singing, then there is a spacy interlude in the middle, and the song wraps up with the final chorus.  It is a structure that Pink Floyd uses a lot, like on Echoes and many other songs.<br />Before releasing this album and Wish You Were Here, Pink Floyd experimented with these songs in concert.  During the Dark Side of the Moon tour, they played a first set that consisted of early versions of songs from Animals and Wish You Were Here.  Sheep was called Raving and Drooling and Dogs was called You've Got To Be Crazy. The differences in these earlier versions are quite interesting.  It would be fantastic if Pink Floyd would release live material from the mid-seventies when they were at their creative best.
B00003CXDG|1.0|This movie was made for two reasons and two people only: Tom Cruise and his ego.  From the opening unrealistic scene of Tom Cruise mountain climbing and jumping from rock to rock in the arizona desert you knew this movie was all about Cruise.  Jump to Cruise chasing after some beautiful woman in a fast car (completely ripped off from James Bond) and he of course he falls in love with her 5 minutes after he gets her in the sack.  And shock shock his boss needs Cruise to 'use' her to get his man.  Now we get to see the anguished Cruise, followed by the superhero action Cruise.<br />Why even bother naming this movie Mission Impossible?  It was cocktail/top gun/days of thunder with high tech gadgets.  Last I checked the actual series and even the first movie was supposed to be about a team.  There were at least three requisite pulling off the fake face routine and by the third time not only was there no suspense it was obvious for even a third grader to figure out.<br />As far as the directing is concerned, yes John Woo is a great director, but he must have shot half the movie in slow motion which made the movie seem ponderous and self indulgent.  It's incredible that off all the movies John Woo made this is the only one that is obviously controlled by the star, and the funny thing is I like a lot of Tom Cruise movies.  The one star is for the music but even that got on my nerves by the end.  For Tom Cruise fans only.
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha was a book about a man who was just that, a man.  He wanted to see the great illustrious one, the budda.  Once he found that the great budda was just a man too, he set out in life with the wind as his guide.  But through his experience and what he learned from others, he became the budda and never really knew it.  This book shows us that if we internalize what we have learned and treat all people as equals, we can accomplish our dreams and become the great person that we are all meant to be.  C. Jeff Dyrek, the Yellow Airplane guy
B000001EL3|4.0|This may not be the BEST KISS album (KISS ALIVE!-my choice), but this wax turned America on to something I learned with Dressed To Kill-KISS was here to stay regardless of what critics had to say. DESTROYER has every element any general rock fan deserves and craves. Killer rockers like &quot;Detroit Rock City and King Of the Nightime World&quot; to ballads as &quot;Beth&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; A typical Bob Ezrin production, this album lacks Ace Frehley's blistering solos, but redeems itself with heavy drumming. Just imagine Eric Carr playing the drums on this album-Eric could pound the spots off a leopard! Gene and Paul's writing, with the help of co-writers, showed they got what it takes to write platnium-selling records. Destroyer paved the way for the rest of rock and roll to stand up, take notice, and take what THEY heard and and mold into THEIR own. DESTROYER has, well you know what I mean, ah GUTS! I'd recommend this record to a first time listener, I just wouldn't show them the album cover until after they've listened.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I first saw Kubrick's work with A Clockwork Orange.  Though I liked the book, I was less animate about the film.  As a result, I was a little leery of his movies.  I saw Oliver Stones' Platoon and was less than impressed.  I had heard good things about Full Metal Jacket, so I thought I would see it, hoping it would exceed Platoon.  It did.  The first half of the film was chilling, and Private Pile's ordeal made me sick, especially during the brutal hazing scene.  Though I usually am not so sensitive to violence in movies, Private Pile's last scene was one of the scariest and disturbing I've seen.  The second half was excellent as well and, to my relief, less upseting than the first.  It had some of the most gripping battle scenes imagineable.  Overall, the movie was truly great, with great acting (something often lacking in movies), great cinematography, and a great plot.
B0000508U6|5.0|I resisted buying this album for ages because &quot;Yellow&quot; was on the radio every two seconds.  Thank goodness I did.  Each track is better than the next but best of all are the guitars on the opening track.
B00005BJPO|5.0|This was the classic anime that everybody talks about but is really hard to find in video stores. This DVD edition is incredible, the menus are sublime and the special features are easy to use(even for a new user of dvds like me).<BR> This has to be the best animated movie out there...
B00005NKK8|5.0|The music on this double CD definds a period of history (much like the film sought to do).  If you're new to 60's and 70's music, but are interested in the music then this is an excellent album to start off your collection.  From Dylan to the Doors and from Presley to Picket it has a lot of classics from the era and in fact a lot of tracks that are not in the original film.<br />For someone who already has a lot of albums from the 60's and 70's then you will probably find a lot of familiar tracks on this album, nevertheless it works wonders as a compilation and there is bound to be quite a few tracks that you don't have.<br />Certainly give the album a listen and then make up your mind. For lovers of 60's and 70's music you will be doing yourself a favour by adding this to your collection.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Hannibal Lecter in love; chilling thought.  <BR>The movie's ending was much more intriguing than the book's, in that Clarice was allowed to keep her idealism, and Lecter his mystery.  He did not love Starling in the book, he was merely obsessed.  His manipulation of her through the use of drugs and mis-use of his analytical genius only brain-washed her, it did not sway her to actually love him.  He controlled her, but only as a trainer does a dog.  <BR>In the movie's ending, the tension is kept open, and his feelings for her are shown to be more than mere lust for control.  He is evil, yes. Exceedingly so.  He is depraved... more than any other single character I can think of (except, perhaps, Mason Verger). But he also respects her and admires her for her courage and incorruptibility.  &quot;...all you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror.&quot;  His twisted self-sacrifice reinforces to us (and HER) that she has nothing to fear from him.  &quot;The world is more interesting with you in it.&quot;  Also, it shows us he'll be back.  <BR>Goody-goody!<BR>By allowing Clarice to keep the true core of herself, her incorruptibility, the door is left open for the possible exploration of Lecter's vast mind chambers, and the catalyst that brought him to his current state of depravity.  This sub-plot, exposed in the book, but wisely absent from the film, leaves us with a veritable FEAST of psychological interplay between our favorite anti-hero and his love interest in the future. <br />Let Hannibal run free.  Let him heal from his wounds.  Let Starling face her doom at the hands of those who &quot;depise her almost as much as she despises them.&quot;  Let some time pass.  Then, when she least expects it, let Starling come under Lecter's spell...   &quot;All good things to those who wait.&quot;   I'm sure they can have some &quot;fuuunnnn&quot; when they do finally hook up.<br />SotL, as well as Hannibal, are not so much about the gore and shock and killing as they are about the characters, and the relationships between them.  The biggest chill of Silence was NOT Buffalo Bill, but the slowly building tension between Hannnibal and Clarice, culminating in that split second contact between them when he brushed her finger with his through the bars of his cell.  <BR>Ditto, the builing tension in Hannibal... he brushes her hair in the train station while passing by on the carousel, he breaks into her car and sniffs and licks her steering wheel(you MUST see the DVD)... chivalry rules as he sweeps her up and carries her to safety from the pigs... he performs surgery on her shoulder and cares for her medically, he caresses her cheek while looking deep in her eyes at the dinner table... all this leading up to the fateful moment.... the delicious kiss.  Absolutely incredible.  The DVD offers an extended moment of this... him nuzzling her and tasting her with his tongue.  WOW!<BR>If the talked-about sequel explores any of the materal hinted at in the book, watch out!  I think it would be quiet something to know these two in private life.  Wink.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This film is weak in many ways, but is visually fun to watch.  I don't really care how much technology went into making Jar-Jar appear to enteract with real people, he sucked.  He was whiny, stupid, and never developed beyond those two traits.  If he had just been left out the film would have been a tad darker, but would have had oh, so much more punch.  Sadly, defiant George has condemned us all to another installment of that floppy-eared idiot.  But the DVD does look great; worth having for the crisp visuals alone.
B00004Z459|1.0|Linkin Park have plenty of potential. However, by some freak occurance this album has made a huge impact on the music industry. This is a shame as their sound is not mature enough yet. They are still finding their feet and this really comes across in the dreadfull and samey songs such as &quot;Paper cut&quot; and the over-rated crawling. Still, if you like mindless sloppy guitars with a small rat man screaching and some guy trying to be black then this is for you. Let's hope this dreadfull debut doesn't put any serious music fans (Not small 14 year old Offspring junkies who think their hardcore) off buying their next album which might just be good. Linkin Park are not worthy of their &quot;Nu Metal&quot; label. Or as they put it &quot;Death Metal.&quot; Please. If you were to put all the songs on a straight cycle with no pause between you wouldn't notice them changing. Just too samey.
B00005KHLV|5.0|&quot;In The Mood For Love&quot; shows how two people's lives intersect through the infidelities of their spouses. Wong Kar-Wai creates a wonderful rich world with vibrant brooding colors perfectly matched to early 1960s Hong Kong. The restrained vibe of the film also is a match, adding to the claustrophobic empathy I felt watching these two neighbors (gorgeously played by Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung) navigate their lives and their marriages around the close knit small town qualities of their apartment building.<br />If you're looking for graphic sensuality (also if you're looking for quick answers or aren't patient with a film paced on the indefinite aspects of real life), you have the wrong movie.<br />Watching this film is like being inside the head of someone trying to remember a distant memory. Some details are sharp and richly colored, others are elliptical and elusive.  This movie gives and asks of the viewer more than your typical Hollywood fare. The attention to detail is impressive (I want Maggie Cheung's wardrobe from this film!) A definite recommend.
6302642256|4.0|David Freeman is a typical 12 year old boy in 1978.  He lives with his parents and his annoying little brother in Florida.  David also dreams of entering his pet dog in frisbee tournaments and getting the nerve to ask the girl next door out.  However, on the 4th of July in 1978, something unexpected occurs, and David finds that almost 8 years have passed!  His parents have aged, and so has his brother (who strangely does not use this oppurtunity to exact vengeance on his now &quot;younger brother&quot;).  Even stranger, NASA has secretly uncovered a flying saucer, and when they find that some strange brain patterns from David resemble the form of the spacecraft, they use the theory of why David hasn't aged in 8 years, and put him on NASA's base.  There, they find countless star charts logged into David's brain, and decide to keep DAvid on an extended stay.  ONe night, David hears a strange noise, and sneaks into a hanger, where he encounters the flying saucer.  He gains entry and is interfaced with the computer's intelligence: a strangerobotic eye that can talk and more.  Soon, the two are off, with an agreement for David to give the lifeform (the ship, nicknamed MAX by David) his star charts if he'll help David get home.  <br />  A rather long summary, but a very good film.  One of the first major scores for Alan Silvestri after composing Back to the Future, &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot; is filled with synthesized music and very eerie futuristic tones.  Also, given it's a Disney feature, it gets corny at times, notably when the ship has collected other life forms (though how he got them onto the ship is a mystery), mostly all puppets or wire-frame puppets.  The visual animation to make the ship works well, considering the years before digital technology and the establishment of major FX houses.<br />  The story is one that is made in the vein of simplicity, yet has some elements that would be welcome in most films today.  Also, being a sci-fi film of the 80's, this one wouldn't be complete without some mention to the film E.T.
B00005B36H|5.0|A year ago Tool didn't exist for me. I have never heard of this band. Then came the great song called Passenger, on the Deftones' album White Pony, featuring vocals from a guy named James Maynard Keenan. I loved his voice and i found out he's the singer of a certain band named Tool.<BR>Here i am now, listening to Lateralus, the latest Tool album, and i can't believe my ears. It's probably the best album i've heard in a long time. Unlike you other Tool fans, i can't compare this to anything, because this is the only Tool material i know. I haven't listened to the other albums so i don't know if this is better or worse than the previous.<BR>But i know one thing.<BR>Lateralus amazes, from the beginning til the end. You don't even know what to appreciate more: Danny Carey's incredible drumming, Keenan's fabulous voice, the complexity of every single song, the out-of-this-world lyrics.<BR>This is perfect. Starting with The Grudge, a very long track (just like most Tool songs), but very interesting and original. The Patient is an awesome song, with an awesome chorus, and with Keenan singing &quot;I'm still right here - Giving blood, keeping faith, but i'm still right here&quot;. Parabol/Parabola are actually only one song, starting really slow and then growing to a very full of rythm hard rock passage. Ticks and Leeches is the hardest song of the album, and what you notice first is Danny's great drumming. Lateralis, Disposition and Reflection are also good, and then comes one of the best songs of the album, Triad, a great instrumental that i am sure you'll love.<BR>What the hell are you still doing here?? Get your eyes off this stupid monitor, leave that poor mouse alone and go buy this album!!! You'll love it. After all, we are eternal, and all this pain is an illusion...............
B00004Z459|5.0|The first time i heard this CD i was like, &quot;this stuff is pretty good.&quot;The next time i heard it i was like, &quot;this is a rock masterpeice!!!!&quot;Linkin Park blew all my expectations away when i heard them. Their not like every other rock band, they have more depth and emotion. if i don't listen to atleast one of their songs a day i feel like i'm missing something, its like an addiction, everytime i listen to it i find something new i like about it. they are hear to stay.
B00005K3LU|5.0|I am no DVD guru, but must say I was HUGELY impressed with the boxed set. It looks fantastic in the holographic packaging, and sits nicely on the shelf (other boxed sets I have need a new shelf height built!).<br />As for quality, the picture was perfect, as was the sound. <br />All the additional extras were fantastic...this was what we all wanted when boxed sets were released! All the fun edited bits, and commentaries by the people you ACTUALLY want to hear from!<br />This is a MUST for anyone who loves action films. And for anyone else too!
B00005LMBK|5.0|If u bought this album because of the single Clint Eastwood, u bought this album 4 the wrong reason, because none of the songs sound anything like it, (with the exeption of Rock tha House which is an excellent track). Also, if u bought this album because u thought it was going to be a gangsta rap album you bought it 4 the wrong reason. But if u bought this album because u like techno hip-hop w/ some good acoustic guitar riffs and awesome brit vocals u might have bought this album 4 the right reason after all.<br />P.S. This should definately not be a PA album. There only two   F-words, one S-word and an A-word. If u have 2 buy the edited version it won't really matter but as everyone knows there's nothin like the origianal.<br />P.S.S. The best tracks are RE-HASH, 5/4, Clint Eastwood, Sound Check, Rock Tha House, 19/2000 and M1 A1.
0061040967|5.0|This lavishly illustrated book was an absolute delight to read through. The story is up to Terry Pratchett's normal Discworld standards, although shorter by a good half or more. He did this by using fewer secondary and tertiary characters than he uses normally. Few new characters are introduced, and those were more of the supporting variety. Also, there are fewer references to a framing event or theme (that he often uses to parallel or heighten the events in the main plot). The structure is a little shallower for these omissions, making me think that this book might have started as another books B plot before he decided that didn?t do it justice, and became a shorter than normal A plot. But Mr. Pratchett needed the room, and the time you?ll spend looking at Paul Kidby's excellent artwork will make this book just as engaging as any of the other Discworld books (pay special attention to the pages from the notebook of &quot;Leonard of Quirm&quot;)!
B000009QPG|5.0|Having always been a metal fan, I must say I was slow to discover Slayer. But I do remember when I first heard them. <br />I used to stay up late at night and listen to a radio station out of Denver (KBPI, I think it was with Uncle Nasty) and I heard &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;. Except they did not say who it was, and as I listened to it (about 11:30pm, real dark night in my bedroom) It really spooked me, but was such good music and musicianship.  Later I found out who it was and bought the album and to this day (Oct. 2001) I still listen to it alot. I love every song on here. It starts out like a nuclear explosion and goes on from there. Favs: Skeletons of Society, War Ensemble, and Dead Skin Mask. <BR>In fact I put this album on and my two year old daughter will dance around and bang her head as soon as she hears the begining of War Ensemble!!<br /> This is a Classic Metal/Speed/Death album and should be have by any fan. If you think todays people (aka: Marilin Manson, Rob Zombie, Etc.) are wicked, then obviously you have not heard Slayer. Buy this album and turn out the lights and turn it up, cause you will.....<br />&quot;Dance with the dead in your dreams..&quot;
B000001C6M|3.0|This CD has alot of great classic slayer songs.&quot;Black Magic&quot; &quot;Die By the Sword,&quot; and &quot;The Antichrist&quot; are some of the best songs Slayer has ever written,and the opener &quot;evil has no boundaries&quot; is also very Memorable.I like the satanic overtone slayer has always had in their music...But sometimes it seems like these guys are trying a little to hard to convince us that they worship the devil.That photo of JeffHanneman with the eye liner and the upside down Cross is A little bit silly.The only problem with this record is the production...It sounds as if it was recorded on a 4 track...But it is a great vintage Slayer CD and it is a MUST HAVE for slayer fans
B00003CXAY|5.0|It is truly sad that one of the most powerful and important statements about the flaws in economic evolution and progress, has become virtually non-existent. Please, please, please, do the world a favour and release this film on DVD. A &quot;must see&quot; for fans of BARAKA.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Sade. I've heard a few of her songs here and there and i've always liked them. So, I decdided to get this best of collection. I'm glad I took notice 'case THE BEST OF SADE is totally awesome. I like each and every song. Even though some of the songs are really old they seem timeless somehow. This collection flows very nicely from early hits like &quot;your love is king&quot; to the smash hit &quot;no ordinary love.&quot; Sade's velvety smooth voice adds a sensual touch to each song. THE BEST OF SADE is filled with soul, R&amp;B, jazz, and rock. A great collection of hits.
0553106635|5.0|With this book, George RR Martin has leapt from a solid second place in the 'my favourite author' race to a pretty convincing first. His writing is phenomenal - a plot so clever it amazes me he can keep it coherent, but keep it coherent he does. It simply never gets bogged down, dull, confusing or lost in back-explanations. Perfectly realised three-dimensional characters, none of whom are wholly good or evil...but some are certainly more likeable than others! A strong sense of humour, wonderful descriptive sense of place/setting and a real talent for gore and shock all combine to make this (and, indeed, this series) one of the best reads I've ever immersed in and certainly the best fantasy. In fact, I've been unable to fully enjoy a fantasy novel since. I almost resent him for it. I love his 'nobody's sacred, anyone can die' style - it lends real suspense to confrontation and battle scenes, sadly lacking in many you-know-who-the-good-guy-is novels. It's just great. I've extolled it enough and feel as if I haven't. I am extensively read in this genre and all I can say is buy it, buy it, buy it.
B000050XEI|1.0|This CD is so over hyped and advertised, that I suggest anyone thinking of buying it should listen to it in its entirety.For those who have bought it, I suggest putting the CD in a pre heated oven at 350 and bake for 7 mins.  At least you will have a bowl that you will get more enjoyment out of than listening to the CD !!!
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Im sorry i can only give this album 4 stars, but im afraid i have to.. Im a huge Dylan fan, albeit a new one. I think that Dylan is the kind of musician who i could never look back on and say &quot;yeah, i remember when i liked him..&quot;; im in it for the long run. That being said, when i listened to this album, i was.. not disappointed, by any means.. rather.. surprised. It really is all played outin a kind of blues/swing/rockabilly revival style, not something i expected at all. Not that its bad. Mississippi i loved from the start, same as po' boy. High water knocked me out, too; its really a great track. The rest threw me for a loop, and i was caught a bit off guard by some of it.. It all gets better with every listen, however, and the initial uneasiness is wearing away to a wonderful feeling of familiarity; of respect for the music and the lyrics, and that kind of sittin-by-the-fire-drinkin-cocoa kind of relaxed feeling you get from your favorite sweater or your favorite old timey record (get it?) To sum up all this mindless rambling, its a good album, but it caught me of guard at first; now that ive listened to it a few times, however, im sure it's on its way to becoming one of my favorites.
B00003CXA3|5.0|While I do not agree with some of The French Connection's Oscar wins (A Clockwork Orange was the Best Picture of 1971), I still believe that this is one of the best action movies ever made. Gene Hackman deservedly won an Academy Award for his performance as Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle, who along with his partner \\"Cloudy\\" Russo (Roy Scheider) attempt to bring down a narcotics ring. The Elevated train-car chase has gone down in cinema history as possibly the best car chase ever filmed. One of the things that make this film so great is its gritty realism. All the sets used are actual interiors and there was hardly any lighting. Director William Friedkin (Who won an Oscar) had a background in documentary. His technique gives a realistic feel to the movie, as if we are there. <br />Recently, when my family decided to purchase a DVD player, the first DVD I got for it was the recently released \\"Five-Star Collection\\" Two Disc set of this movie. The picture quality is excellent. Not a single scratch and no `jittery' frames. There are some scenes that are grainy, especially the opening shots in Marseilles. But this is probably because it was filmed this way. <br />The second disc is loaded with features. There are seven deleted scenes, which can come with or without William Freidkin's commentary. Most of these scenes are character development scenes. But while fascinating to watch them, after you see them you'll understand why they were cut out. There are also two documentaries: BBC's \\"Poughkeepsie Shuffle\\" and a special 30th anniversary documentary that covers the French Connection case, Robin Chases's book and the movie's making.   <br />Overall, this is an excellent DVD that is well worth investing in.
B00005IC2H|4.0|I was watching Reverb on HBO or one of those pay chanels one night. It featured Brok and Sigur Ros. I'v seen Bork on Sturday Night Live and other T.V. show before but have never had the pleasure of seeing Sigur Ros. I Could not change the chanel. I was hyptnotized by there almost haunting yet soothing sound. My Dad play's guitar in a band and I'v never seen anyone play one with a bow. It was hard to understand the lyrics but maybe thats because I don't speak Icelandic tounge or what ever language they speak but that didn't subtract from the feel of the Music. I would say if your into various styles of music it would be a very nice addition too your collection.
6305696071|5.0|Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are worth the cost of this movie and then some. From the moment this movie starts to the end you smile througout its entirety.  Its a great movie if you want your spirts raised, excellent cast including Jason Alexander make this movie a movie to watch again and again.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Their sound is as beautiful as they are.  The music is so so simple and pure and it stands out in sharp contrast to the distortion on Casablanca's vocals.  He has a great voice, by the way, still audible through the studio's machinery.  They really live up to the buzz.  Think the Beatles: made in England, beloved worldwide.  You can definately hear some Blondie, especially the first track &quot;Is this it?&quot; which is a sort of sing-song lullaby that reminds me of &quot;Atomic,&quot; somehow.  Think At the Drive-In with a bit of melody, or Idlewild moves to NYC. <BR>   All comparisons are somehow irrelevant when it comes to the Strokes, though, because they are the only great old-school band you are likely to hear all year.  Still, you really have to listen to this yourself.  Their art is so beautiful because you find the music in yourself.<BR>FUN FACT: <BR>The original cover and the song &quot;NYC Cops&quot; were banned in the USA  despite the fact that the song was in no way threatening or degrading.  (The cover was a bit mysoginist.)
6300213803|4.0|Star Trek has great potential to be stuck in the hokey-schlok-weird-alien-meets-handsome-human-explorer rut.  Although the franchise still occasionally visits this pit, more often than not it avoids the fall.  Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan works the best out of all the classic Trek movies (ending with The Undiscovered Country) because of its superior story and action, its special effects (which still look pretty good today) and direction.  Wrath of Khan also caters two strengths Star Trek that have made the franchise so enduring: character and theme.  There are universal themes throughout the movie that make this sci-fi world applicable to our own; aging, facing and confronting death, the value of life, etc.  The themes are  subtly woven into the text and character interaction so that they're not didactic bombardment, but rather thoughts to be examined later.  Another great part of this movie is that this was the first time that you saw your favorite Trek characters and its beloved ship actually wounded to a severe extent, physically and emotionally, by an unexpected, malevolent force.  The stakes had never been this high before.  This was a true crises and its wonderful to see the shock, the response, and the ultimate price.  This review has a 4.5 star rating actually, and the only downgrade is for the low, occasionally rotten, acting.  Most of the time the cast sticks to their roles admirably, but some lines (particularly by Shatner and Montalban) are either grossly underdone or laughably overdone.  Nevertheless, the script (by long-time Trek writer Harve Bennett) and solid direction of Nicholas Meyer move the story at just the right pace.  Plus, they manage to create a truly honest, tender moment between Kirk (Shatner) and his son, David.  With a notoriously over the top actor like Shatner, creating that kind of moment is a true accomplishment.  Don't let the acting fool you.  This is a beautiful script and a well told story.

B00003CXAA|4.0|Reviewer CPR fron Brooklyn is correct. FFC should have redone the Trilogy (all 11-1/2 hrs) which is on laser disc. This version jumps around so much it is an effort to keep it straight even knowing the story.  When Vito shoots Fanucci you can see his scar from having his throat slit, Hello!  The DVD's Rembrandt mood and lighting is stunning, and you can see Pentangeli's brother talking to Michael in the corner of the screen thanks to the 1:85 ratio. In the DVD's first 3 hours so far, I have seen a couple of clips I don't recall in the Trilogy;  where do these pieces pop up from?   I believe Part 111 is pretty well saved buy the chronological presentation of the Trilogy which tells the story without all the laborious, fancy, gimmicky, cutting, and editing of the origional versions.
B000002UAO|5.0|Wow. This remarkable Beatles masterpiece is one of their many great albums. Especially since it has my favorite Beatles song on it, &quot;Girl&quot;. It is a favorite of mine in my Beatles CD collection. &quot;Girl&quot; isn't the only good song on it, though. &quot;Wait&quot;, with its nice beat, is a good one too, along with a classic, &quot;In my life&quot;. I am not the only 13-year-old that loves the Beatles, and many adults love them, as I do. I highly recommend Rubber Soul! (And the cover adds a nice touch to it!)
6305907145|1.0|Well, to say I was disappointed with this is an understatement.  I cannot believe how unfaithful it is to the book.  Fanny's relationships are completely changed - as is Fanny herself! <BR> I don't know why the director didn't simply write a new story, she obviously didn't like the one by Jane Austen; she changed major portions of plot and invented much of it.
B00000J2KX|5.0|This movie is the scariest movie I've ever seen.  I love this movie so much and it is way underrated.  I think it should get some kind of special award for the greatness of the film.  Jack Nicholson is amazing in this movie, the way his eyes just stare right at you in that evil demented way.  REDRUM now has me scared to death everytime I look at a mirror, I just love it.  I think of this movie every time I look at an axe.  Well thats all I have to say about the greatest horror film of the century
0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning, the first book in the &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; can be classifed as clever, dark, and funny. At the beginning of the book when the author says don't keep reading if you hate bad endings he is quite right. First the Baudelaire children get the most horrifying news from Mr. Poe, a guy who can't seem to stop coughing, that their parents had died in a horrible fire. They have a fortune but they learn the unfortunate news that they can't have it until the oldest Violet who is 14 becomes adult age. So their lawyer Mr. Poe takes the three children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to the horrible guardian Count Olaf who will stop at nothing to get their fortune. The three orphans seem defensless against Count Olaf's evil plans as he traps Baby Sunny in the forbidden tower until Violet would marry him. However Count Olaf seems to have underestimated these smart children! <br />This book was really really funny. In many ways it has the humor and darkness of Harry Potter and even more. This is a great start to the books about the Baudlaire orphans but firsthand let me warn you: If you hate unhappy, unfortunate, bad ending stop reading now!
B00004XONN|5.0|Wow. Never before has a band risen so fast. OK Computer was one of the best albums ever produced, up there with Dark side of the moon, but Kid A is such a complete change and manages to produce a new, great sound that I sit and listen for hours. At the end of each great song, I'm glad to get to the next one because it just gets better and stays away from the art school tripe. This is quite simply one of the best collections of music ever assembled. So, if you have any sense, buy this cd, or obtain it somehow, and enjoy 45 minutes of your life listening to it, as it will be well spent. Also, check out their other albums, Pable Honey, The Bends, OK Computer, and heck, even the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack, but please do yourself a favor and get a hold of Kid A. You'll be glad you did.<br />*The More You Know*
6303314015|5.0|I love this movie soo much... it's a great disney movie to have in your disney collection,yup it really is:-)! So please buy this movie, it's worth everything!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002LIR|5.0|I bought this cd for my sister.  She is the biggest Stewart fan I know.  This is one of the best investments I made because of the happiness that came to my sister.  Any MAN that can make music like this has got to be a keeper.  Keep on making great music. Love ya Rod!!!
B000002OVJ|3.0|After reading how much people enjoyed the new songs that were added on this CD, I eagerly bought it. With only a couple of exceptions, I think the new songs SERIOUSLY detract from what is surely one of the greatest live albums ever made. Here's my take on the new cuts &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; -- hate it. &quot;Fortune Teller&quot; -- ok, but not great. &quot;Tattoo&quot; -- hate it. &quot;Happy Jack&quot; -- ok, but not great. &quot;I'm a Boy&quot; and &quot;A Quick One&quot; -- I really, REALLY dislike both of them. &quot;Amazing Journey/Sparks&quot; -- pretty good, but I was never a big fan of &quot;Tommy&quot;. When the disc finally gets to the last four cuts, I can relax and take my hands off the skip button. These four (and &quot;Young Man Blues&quot;) are what made me play the LP constantly back in the old days.... Amazing guitar riffs, incredible drumming, high energy, and just GREAT songs. Maybe it's because I'm not so much a fan of The Who as I am a fan of &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;, but I wish they had done the sonic remastering and left the song selection alone. A 5-star album sinks to 3 because is makes me so angry.
0679805273|5.0|It has a message for adults as well.
B000002AT6|5.0|I've read all of the reviews below, and several of them mention that the themes sound reminiscent of Braveheart and Titanic.  While I can't disagree (&quot;To the Boys&quot; and &quot;Samuel's Death&quot; sound pretty darn close to the revenge/battle themes of Braveheart, I have to admit), I feel that I must defend Horner's originality.  Each of his classic 90s soundtracks (Legends, Braveheart, and Titanic) have completely seperate themes.  The main theme of Legends can be heard in &quot;The Ludlows.&quot;  Listen to that theme, and then put in Braveheart and listen to song #3.  The themes are totally different.  Similarly, listen to &quot;Rose&quot; on the Titanic soundtrack--completely original.  And yet Horner fans can tell that he composed all of them because of the familiar instruments he favors:  sweeping violins, pipes and flutes, sometimes a choir/vocalist, and that recurring theme that pops up in almost every track at some point, bringing the listener back to the main themes or tragedies of the films.  The movies themselves might be the reason for the &quot;similarities.&quot;  Legends of the Fall, Braveheart, and Titanic are all sad, somewhat tragic movies, filled with death, revenge, danger, and love.  Maybe that's why people sometimes say his themes are too similar--they're actually thinking of the films!
B00004Z3AV|5.0|Queen - The Platinum collection is absolutly a beautiful set. The nicest set in my CD collection. It comes in a sharp looking double jewel case in a slip cover. Contains the UK versions of Greatest Hits I and Greatest Hits II (released with a slightly different track lineup in the states as Classic Queen). All three discs are picture discs with the art that appears on the UK covers and the sound is incredible! The 48 page booklet is also nice. For any Queen fan or fan of rock, this ultra rare import is a must!

B00005Q45W|5.0|I don't have a lot to say.   Sharon Robinson provided Lenny with a nearly perfect atmosphere for his absolutely polished words and his creepily resonant voice.   I'm stunned.   The last two studio albums (I'm Your Man and The Future - both of which I loved) didn't have nearly the finished quality this one has.  And it has that quality without sacrificing even a little of Cohen's magnificent, even ponderous quirkiness.   Ohgodohgodohgod I hope he tours behind this one.  I suppose not...
B000002X0Z|5.0|mobb deep are the best hip-pop group in this rap game, so f#*k all the player-haters by gunmanmoses.
0024181900|3.0|I found many things that the authors advised against to be quite acceptable in today's formal writing.
B00005B36H|5.0|This cd is rocking hard...not just because of the music, but also because of the way the cd was produced.  I suggest listening to the cd for the first couple of times with headphones...you can hear some of the great automation and mastering went into the songs.  Awesome stuff.
B00004RF9I|4.0|What does she say, Max's wife, the movie is incredible and proving the disinterest the world has in itself over and over.  From the start with Finch's character mentioning his initial intentions, to the reason for the multinational presence into culture, pop culture, without being TRULY popular in a good way, in a way, let's say, okay?  But William Holden's Max Schumacher's wife says something to him during their argument that is dubbed over at a crucial part, if anyone knows what she says I'd appreciate knowing.  Rent this, feel guilty, then contribute to the world positively through artful mentation.  Buy, rent, download, or pay per bit, it's worth knowing about this film.
B000022TT4|5.0|Absolutely awesome. If you like U2, if you like Joshua Tree, this is a must-own. Drop twenty and pick this up.
B00004W221|1.0|I am constantly astonished at the number of people that appear to be otherwise intelligent who love this film. Perhaps they harbor the fantasy that if one simply wishes hard enough then all will be well. Rudy is the kind of person that most people dislike and avoid in real (and &quot;reel&quot; for that matter) life. I can't imagine that the &quot;real&quot; Rudy could possibly be as stupid as the moron depicted in this film. Everything about this film rings false, contrived, manipulative and hokey. <br />This is not an &quot;underdog&quot; film.  This is a celebration of sheer stupidity set to an insipid soundtrack that cues the viewer with all the subtlety of fingernails on a blackboard (in the event that the viewer is as stupid as the subject). This film reminds me of the worst of evangelical recruiting efforts..... Highly implausible plot, miracle occurs, end credits set to swelling orchestration, lights up, tearful narrator exhorting the audience to pledge their souls to &quot;Jay-sus&quot;. This film should certainly reside on the list of most ridiculous efforts of the 1990's. Avoid this as one would avoid excrement on the sidewalk.
015670160X|5.0|On top of the beautiful imagery and quirky central character, that tricky Virginia Woolf brings us scary, unusual ideas and makes us listen...and care...and laugh...and see the world in a new way.  Isn't that what art does?
0061040967|5.0|If this book has a fault, it's that it's too short! The story is standard Pratchett fare (i.e. wonderfully witty and entertaining) and the illustrations are simply superb. If you like Pratchett's Discworld novels, you MUST get this book. I promise, you will not be disappointed.
B00005MP58|2.0|I already owned the original DVD to this wonderful movie.  It bothered me that the credits ran every 50 minutes and that there were no extras, so I was so excited about the new &quot;special edition&quot; DVD.  I ordered it right away.  When I got it, I couldn't wait to watch the featurette... but first I had to watch some of the movie.<br />I was SOOOO disappointed!  The picture quality was abysmal!  The contrast was set so high that all the characters looked sickly.  Also, their dark hair would just blend with dark backgrounds, creating just an all around terrible picture.<br />At first I thought it was just the DVD, but then I watched the featurette, which was fine.  The featurette had clips from the film and it was so nice to see the characters looking robust and the backgrounds lush again.<br />My advice: if you must have the DVD, try to get your hands on the non-special edition.<br />I plan on sending a letter of complaint to the distributors, and would suggest others who are disappointed do the same.  Perhaps if enough people complain, they will re-remaster it or un-remaster it, so it looks the way it should.
B00004SCX6|5.0|It is not like used. I have nothing to complain, thank you!
B000002JS0|5.0|AC/DC first North American release was a collection of  songs about the rock 'n roll life style.  Hard rock with a mild blend of blues, AC/DC's sound was very memorable and their High Voltage album would be too.<br />Who could argue that AC/DC would not be a band to remember.  During 1976 rock bands like Heart, Peter Frampton and The Bee Gees ruled the air waves and to have a group of rowdy ruff hard rocking Aussies with a maniacal front man show up, who wouldn't notice?<br />Anyway the album is a classic!  The title track HIGH VOLTAGE, TNT and LIVE WIRE are the highlights but other<BR>good tracks are IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP IF YOU WANNA ROCK 'N ROLL, ROCK 'N ROLL SINGER, CAN I SIT NEXT TO YOU GIRL, and THE JACK.  The other two songs<BR>SHE GOT BALLS and LITTLE LOVER are basically filler but some fans may like them a lot.<br />Bottom line AC/DC's debut should not be avoided.  Sure it's no Back in Black or Highway to Hell but it is a good rock album. I love the guitar playing on LIVE WIRE!  I enjoyed the album very much!  Almost every songs is good!<BR>Highly Recommended!
0226264017|5.0|30 Years ago, the sophisticated wags of the intelligencia told us Milton was wrong, that he was a guy who just didn't get it. ! Well, so many years later, the reality that capitalism and freedom are inextricably linked is the overriding truth of our times. Milton has triumphed. This great book is another brick in the wall of the Friedman legacy. While years ago no one might want to admit that Milton was right, today legions of people see the light. One of Milton's disciples, David Henderson, has just written a book that Friedman enthusiasts, like myself, may also enjoy: The Joy of Freedom: An Economist's Odyssey. A nice bookend to this new Friedman book.
B0000029DD|5.0|At first listen, the entire album seemed to me an incomprehensible jumble of confused instrumentation and Buckley waxing lyrical as a result of a drug-induced haze, however, after the second repeat, things were starting to make sense. The melodies were getting stuck in my head, and Buckley's emotional intensity was starting to rub off. The delicate wavering nuances of his voice suddenly seemed to be a result of purpose, and not some experimental whim. Even his rendition of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, which at first seemed tired and contrived now seemed to have a new life of it's own, and &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; had not acquired the tired sheen of a regular pop-single. I guess it's just an album that grows on you.....
006092988X|5.0|One of the best stories I have ever read.  The book is amazing throughout, as Francie and the Nolans struggle through life in the Willamsburg tenaments.  Francie is an amazing character, one of the most complex I have ever read about.  She offers a completely different perspective on the world, one of innocence.<br />The story itself is complete.  Very well written, with great descriptions and complete thoughts.
B000003H2W|5.0|if you like goth metal, and you don't have this cd, your missing out.  the vocals, and music go greatly together,
B00003CX5P|5.0|Even if you don't enjoy the story, the special effects and audio are worth it. I just watched it again last night with the volume way up. Wow!<br />The second disc is also very interesting. All the making of....   Very cool stuff. This is a very high tech film. A real keeper.
0451203933|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read about the true accounts of war. I've seen several interviews with many of those who survived this horrific event. You can not really appreciate what they said with out actually reading their story.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This movie helped me understand the seduction of the criminal lifestyle. Perhaps it can be summed up this way:<br />You never answer to any other man.<br />Ever.<br />True, it's the freedom and liberation of a barbarian, but who of us hasn't wanted to chuck everything at some point and live by our own rules? This movie was exhilarating, disturbing and ultimately heart-breaking because it also reveals the inevitable fate that awaits those on this path and all the carnage that occurs along the way. It also shows why we must put limits on our egos, desires and ambitions if we want to know meaningful relationships during our brief time on this earth.<br />De Niro and Pacino have never been so intensely inside of their roles, and the supporting cast is fully up to the challenge of helping carry the storyline forward. And the action scenes almost gave me a heart attack; they are that good.<br />Heat never pulls any punches; I highly recommend it.
0446605409|4.0|Demille has done it again! Plum Island has it all for those looking for an exciting book to enjoy at the beach or anyplace else you go to escape and relax. It's loaded with well-developed characters, hot action scenes and light, breezy dialogue. The plot is always enteraining and fast-paced; although at times, a bit predictable. DeMille's latest is well-worth your investment but don't expect it to be in the same league as Word Of Honor, The Gold Coast and The Charm School
B00005214X|5.0|Those 5 stars are for of the original 18 songs. Ignore the bonus and program the cd-player. <br />Like 80% of the people who bought/buy this album I´am a Beatles-fan. I have never liked GH too much from the Beatle-time. It wasn´t until ´The White Album´ peroid that he began to write some decent songs and then those classics from ´Abbey Road´. I thought it was a big risk buying this rather overpriced re-packaged cd. I just wanted the original songs. Anyway, GH is obviously having a great time although he is singing WAH-WAH to Paul McCartney. There are many really good tracks here.<BR> <BR>I have to say that this album took me by surprise. <br />Standout tracks: Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let it Roll),<BR>Awaiting on You All, My sweet Lord, If Not For You, Beware of Darkness.
B00003CX8I|3.0|This is another in a series of modern superhero flicks that attempts to make itself relevant to today's social issues, but while films like the Mystery Men poke satire at being an adolescent misfit, the type that gets into comic books, and does it tongue in cheek, this film attempts to proselotyze about how hard it is to be accepted when you are gifted. The moral of the story in this film is black and white and it lacks the the insights of the Mystery Men or the character development for that matter.<br />  The scenes itegrate the special effects flawlessely and its inherent watchability as well as the looks of the charcters are its strongpoints, the flip side is that the story moves too flawlessely and the whole film feels shallow, like a thirty minute TV episode.
0694003611|5.0|Between my sister and my self we have 3 girls.  Each one has enjoyed this book.  Would highly recommend.
B000002HGD|5.0|Forget what you hear about this album being a mixed bag of empty pop music and failed attempts at bluesy rock. Forget everything about this being more of a sampler than an album. Forget everything about this disc having nothing to say. Remember this is one of the greatest recordings ever.<BR>   I don't use those words lightly, and one shouldn't. All I can say is that no other album as impacted me like this one has. It's an extremely emotional, desperate, spiritual experience. You may not get it right away, but that's okay. I suggest your first listen be in the car on a stormy day speeding down the highway. Listen to the whole thing from begining to end, no matter if tracks like &quot;All That I Need Is To Be Loved&quot; shock you to the point of pressing the skip button. Then listen to it again. The first time I heard this album I cried for hours. I can't decribe what went through my mind...I'm not sure I'd know how to start.<BR>   If you can, find &quot;Hymn (This is My Dream)&quot; and &quot;Hymn.Quiet.Alt Version&quot;. These are two mind blowing versions of the opening track and perfectly complement the album. One is like a whole different song all together (almost has a religious feel with a choir in the backround). The second is a thirty minute ambient track that must be listened to in it's entirety with the volume full blast. These two songs reveal how great of an artist Moby is.
0425152251|5.0|It's basically an over view on Western Philosophy wrapped in a cute and whimsical story line. Ever so readable when it comes to philosophy; I can think of no other book to start with as a primer on the subject.  The book does seem to dichotomize itself from lesson to story plot, which I liked, because I found myself interested in the history of philosphy in one chapter then interested in the plot in another.  The ending seems to divide readers into two camps:  Weird and flakey; or well done.  I personally enjoyed the book from cover to cover.  Besides the dissension in the ending, it is still well worth the purchase and the read.
B00003CX9E|5.0|We all know by now that Citizen Kane is almost always named the best or one of the best movies ever made.  With its arrival on DVD, we can see why in a different light.  The sound and picture are fantastic considering the age of the film, and the bonus features, though sparse, certainly add to the experience.  Orson Welles inserts his own past, present, and future into the telling of the life of William Randolph Hearst, and the results are less than uplifting.  The young Kane shows an admirable disdain for his money, and money never really gets hold of him, directly; but the power and art that money can buy do indeed take over his soul, and his youthful idealism (or was it just a put-on) gives way to the central fact of his life - &quot;If I say it is so, it is so, for I am Charles Foster Kane!&quot;  Welles is a fine actor, but a greater director - the film is full of memorable images that have no doubt come to define what many of us expect from motion pictures.  The two-hour documentary on disc two is interesting stuff, but better still was the made-for-HBO &quot;RKO 281&quot;.  Catch it if you can.
B000002U82|5.0|Rock-n-roll is unique in that it allows every genre of music into it's sound and this album is an example of that. To me DSOTM is more of a jazz album than a rock album. I would not say it has anything to do with classical though. This album is not for the impatient type and I would suggest that many probably get nothing from it. For those who say it is not art that only furthers my belief that it is. A piece of art will usually do, at the very least, two things. One will be to express a social comment or enlightenment of the human condition and the other will be to elicit strong opinions of it's merit. DSOTM was an attempt to argue that power has the ability to corrupt society (explicitly in songs like &quot;Us and Them&quot; with it's social comment on racism) and DSOTM has always been a piece that was either loved or hated. <br />I for one get it and that is all that counts. This album brings a great deal of listening pleasure for me and that is all that matters. I cannot convince those who &quot;don't get it&quot; to ever appreciate DSOTM, much like the lovers of &quot;Piss Christ&quot; will never convince me of it's artistic merits. Ahhh.... isn't subjectivity a great thing?<br />So in the end I will not recommend this album. Your own subjectivity will work just fine. I can only encourage you to explore things that you haven't and if this album is one of the them then I encourage you to try it.
B000006MS3|5.0|She is, along with Stevie Nicks, the mother of the 90's sound. Influencing such lesser acts as Tori Amos, Maxwell, Paula Cole, Cocteau Twins, etc., Kate has blown pop music into areas only rivalled by Can. But this album and \\"The Sensual World\\" really capture Kate at her best. She is as raw here as she is indulgent in \\"The Sensual World\\". <BR>    After \\"Never for Ever\\" her sound needed to grow up and explore her hallmark oblique style. She more than met the challenge. Songs about the search for knowledge, \\"sat on your lap\\", the Vietnam War, \\"pull out the pin\\", the life of houdini, \\"houdini\\", drug trafficking, \\"night of the swallow\\", and ultimately, problem-solving, \\"get out of my house\\". She even began using loops and sophisticated keyboard sounds. Just as well, she experimented with rhythms and melodies and a percussive sound, more atune to Peter Gabriel and Can and the Beatles, all of whom she surpasses. <BR>    Most people miss the nuances of this album. If you can't get past that three-octave voice or the drums, then don't read any further. If you like pop songs with an edge, then go ahead and purchase the record. It's a rich amalgamation of witty lyrics and dark themes.<BR>   And finally, the last song on the album is the most misunderstood of all of her works. It is a six minute epic ( I should say \\"epoch\\") about  dealing with your problems when you see them. This disguised within the frame of a woman's house (her body) being invaded by a dark figure. She lashes out at him and wins. Most people interpret this as some kind of anti-rape song, but that is not the case-though \\"feet\\" is used to mean privates. The male vocal on the song is her brother Paddy who wails and harangues throughout. Overall the ditty that was inspired by \\"The Shining\\", will creep the daylights out of you.
6302814782|3.0|This 1987 cult classic is a fun and wild good time. A mother and her two sons(Dianne Wiest, Jason Patric, Corey Haim), move to a coastal California town to live with the mom's Dad(Barnard Hughes). The boys soon discover that this picturesque little town isn't all it seems to be. Kiefer Sutherland is the leader of a group of vampires terrorizing the town. Big brother Michael(Patric)gets involved with them, thanks to a beautiful young woman he falls for(Jami Gertz). Then enters Corey Feldman. He plays a guy who knows the town's deadly secret and tries to help out the other Corey. Still with me?. Good. This was the first collaboration between the two Corey's, who would go on to do a number of films together. I'm sure their huge teenybopper status helped this film succeed at the box office. Edward Herrmann, who is a great actor, seems horribly miscast here. The rest of the cast is all very good. This isn't a heavy film that is meant to be taken seriously. It's a campy, comic book-ish type rollercoaster ride that is just supposed to be fun. And fun it definitley is. There are pinches of black comedy sprinkled throughout as well. Jason Patric delivers his best performance. Come to think of it, I can't really think of another Jason Patric performance besides the awful &quot;Speed 2&quot;. Kiefer Sutherland rules the show tho. He's very good. All in all, this is fun entertainment not to be taken too seriously. Just have fun.
B000001G16|5.0|Richie Sambora is one of the best yet least recognized guitar players of our time. In each of his songs you not only hear a skifful guitar player but you also hear the &quot;felling&quot; in the song. Throw in his voice and that bluesy sound just mixes perfectly.
B000001DQI|5.0|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road has to be the most quintessential Elton John album. It's the one mentioned and talked about the most. It should be. It is the best double album. Although, in today's world, this 17 song collection probably wouldn't be considered a double album. It starts off with one of the greatest album openers ever, &quot;Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;. A classic all the way. This album has a number of Elton's most recognized hits - &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot;, The great &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting&quot;, and the original, and still best, version of &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot;. There are more great tracks here that are just as good. You get &quot;Sweet Painted Lady&quot;, which is about prostitutes. Then you have the storysong &quot;The Ballad Of Danny Bailey&quot;, which you wish Elton would play in concert. You get a number of great rockers like &quot;Dirty Little Girl&quot;, &quot;All The Young Girls Love Alice&quot;, and &quot;Your Sister Can't Twist(But She Can Rock And Roll)&quot;, among others. But, the crowning jewel, is the highly underrated and horribly overlooked gem, &quot;Harmony&quot;. It's the closing track and, without a doubt, the greatest Elton John song that was never a single. That's a crime if ever there was one. It's a great piece of music. The album also includes the rousing up tempo number &quot;Grey Seal&quot;. The silliest track is a song called &quot;Jamaica Jerk Off&quot;. It's fun and catchy, but silly. There you have it. The perfect Elton John album. The perfect rock album. This is Elton's Sgt. Pepper. A classic in every sense of the word.
B000002MX7|5.0|This girl knows how to get down.  She has got one of the best soulful voices with outstanding range.  She's one of the few that can scream in key.  This CD shows her amazing versatility as she ranges from mellow ballads to toe tapping, hand clapping funky tunes.  She really rocks when backed up by her old band Rufus.  Ain't Nobody is one of the best songs of all time.
B000023VR6|4.0|this is not only one of the best rap albums of '99, but one of the great albums of that year period. Everyone who thought Dr. Dre no longer had it was silenced when this album came out. From track 1 to track 22 there was nothing but solid tracks and even the skits were funny and didn't draw from the album. Some of my favorite songs were **** you, XXplosive, The Next Episode, and Forgot About Dre. The only problem in this album in my opinion was the fact that there were too many guests. Dre didn't even rap in some of the tracks and I thought he could've been slightly more represented since it is his album. But that is very minor and I do totally suggest this album to any rap fan out there. You will not be disappointed...Guess who's back
B00004STPT|5.0|The film was great and the music for this movie was excellent! I didn't realize that there are still composers out there who can compose a great classical CD.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|This is a great DVD - the picture is so clear it is amazing!  [I never realized how bad our video copy was until I saw this DVD!].  My preschooler LOVED Dopey's mine ride [the game] and she also enjoyed &quot;goddess of the spring&quot; [an animated short included].  The history and information included is very interesting [though I do agree with an earlier reviewer who said it was a little too &quot;Wow, isn't Disney just the best ever?!!  We rule!!&quot;].  But it was enjoyable none-the-less.<br />My one complaint - this DVD doesn't include the Spanish Language version of the film [which I *know* is already done and available on Video &quot;Blanca Nieve...&quot;].  We use our Disney DVDs to teach our children Spanish [its working Great, by the way].  Why on Earth, in a DVD this comprehensive, would Disney leave out the Spanish Language version?  They included the French...  We were very dissappointed.
B000059MEK|5.0|This is a great CD to get  you up-and-going or lift your mood, if you like a dance music. Creative music, similar to New Order.
B0000024SI|1.0|Highway 61 is a masterful album - great protest lyrics mixed with poetic imagery and every song a classic, the band complementing Dylan to perfection and his timing, as most of his sixties albums, very impressive. You've got to remember how young Dylan was when making this album (25 I think) and have to marvel at the control he has over his art.<br />One of the best rock n roll albums full stop from the man who has outlasted and outsmarted them all (I think).
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I really enjoyed the Moulin Rouge, just because of its originality and creativity. The CD doed not include all the songs from the movie, but it is still very good (Nicole Kidman can actually sing!).
B000001Y5J|5.0|What we have here is Halo 5, Broken, the first NIN release to come out on Nothing Records, and what a way to start it off!<BR> As others have already said, this is NIN's hardest and loudest release(next to Fixed, Broken's remix album). And of course, this is a good thing. If you've worn out Pretty Hate Machine with that &quot;pop&quot; feel, this one will blow it out of the water!<BR> Pinion is a EXCELLENT way to start out the album. It fades in, with freaky sounds in the background. I think it's great to have this as the opening track, it fits perfect...the anger just builds up, and suddenly stops,only for it to start again, this time in Wish.<BR> Wish is one unforgatable song(they play it live to this day). I remember when I first heard it when I was about 6 or 7, and since then, it's been one of my favorites. Certainly a high point of the EP. The anger builds, and builds, and then *woosh!* a soft wind like sound could be heard...<BR> Bang! Last breaks through the silence! This is one which I never liked years ago, but now LOVE. It's that type of song. It has great lyrics, a very catchy riff, and a awesome chorus. What more could you ask for?<BR> The softest track on the EP, Help Me I'm In Hell, is next. I think this song is good, but you have to listen to it in a certain state of mind. You can't listen to this song when you're in a good or bad mood, you have to be in a dissapointed or confused mood. When you listen to the song with that sort of feeling inside of you, it WILL creep you out, which is great.<BR> Trent Screams!...to start off Happiness In Slavery, one which may remind some of a PHM track, mainly because this is one of the two songs that uses a synthisizer. I think this song is good, but it's not my favorite on the track.<BR> The most self-loathing track on the EP, Gave Up, is the &quot;last&quot; track. I think this song is good, though it may take just a little getting used to, with all the noise going on towards the end of the song. The end will give you a little taste of what to expect on the remix EP, Fixed.<BR> On comes track 98, Physical. This is a good, strong rock song, and I think many will like it after the first listen.<BR> Suck, the true last song of the EP, is a excellent way to end this great EP. With a very good bass/synth thing going on, along with the loud chorus, and a build-down at the end, this one will certainly stand out as well.<BR> All in all, this certainly deserves all 5 stars. I personally like every single song on this EP, and this stands out as one of my favorite NIN releases. <BR> And the comment about Broken being Fixed, Fixed is Broken? Well...give Fixed a listen, all the songs are Broken into shattered pieces! Thing is...it's in a good way.
0790729377|2.0|I remember seeing the cartoon production of this play as a child.  Vivien Leigh is nothing compared to Marge Simpson, and Marolon Brando just couldn't pull off the same caliber of performance as Ned Flanders.<br />It's your typical delicate-flower-turned-crazy-slut story.  And it's jammed packed with poetic moments- one after another after another until you want to smash something- which is what Stanley does.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Glory, oh Glory! It's about time that a such a GREAT country album was released. For too long, country music has had the Faith's and Shania's of the world shoved down our throat with bland, pop-country &quot;hits&quot;. With the release of the &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack, country has come full circle. <br />Obviously, the bit hit on the album is &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; by The Soggy Bottom Boys (featuring Dan Tyminski). It's success on radio as well as CMT and GAC surprised many who thought it too &quot;country&quot;. Isn't it nice sometimes to see people eat their words? <br />Alison Krauss provides her vocal talent on four songs: &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot;; &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; with Gillian Welch; &quot;I Am Weary&quot; with the Cox Family; and &quot;Don't Leave Nobody But the Baby&quot; with Gillian Welch and Emmylou Harris, which is such a gem. If the vocals on the song don't send shivers down your spine, the added background sounds will. <br />Other standouts on the CD include: &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues&quot;, &quot;O Death&quot; by the legendary Ralph Stanley, and &quot;Angel Band&quot; by The Stanley Brothers.<br />Overall, the CD is nothing short of fantastic. True country fans will respect the use of more traditional artists like Ralph Stanley and Emmylou Harris. I can honestly say that there is not one bad track on the CD. Hopefully the release of the album will bring new fans to country.<br />And as a side note, congrats to everyone involved on this fine album for their 2001 CMA wins! You definantely earned it!<br />Gennie Bailey-Rogers
B000002G23|4.0|It is VERY cool to own this boxed set--EVERY song<BR>The Police ever did, etc.  Can't fault music side of<BR>this collection one bit...but are liner notes too<BR>much to ask for?  There are some songs on these CDs I <BR>never heard of, and I would like to know the words<BR>but can't make them out just listening...like the<BR>song TOO MUCH INFORMATION.  <br />That's my only gripe, and why I won't award 5 stars.<BR>But other than that, this set is freakin' awesome!
B000002VTE|5.0|first off, don't let the average customer rating affect your decision even a little.  i only mention this because at the time of my writing, the average review was 3.5 stars, when there are hundreds of more mainstream recordings with 4 and 4.5 star ratings that are far inferior.  i think spiritualized just attracts a more discerning ear.  i guess i'm one of the few exceptions.<br />I first got into this album about a year ago, and i haven't gotten tired of a minute of it.  it's a wonderful album of truly unique, highly diverse moments.  it's one of those albums where the styles are both wildly varied and summarily successful.  all these songs work in their own grounds, and all flow well together.  this album works as a whole, but not in any overly magical way.  truthfully, there are albums out there that are more cohesive, but none of them can match the diversity of style to be found here.  i recommend this album very highly.
B000002UA0|5.0|Very brilliant debut.  I've always enjoyed Syd Barrett.  His poetry is far more intellect than most &quot;beat&quot; writers.  His stories are very descriptive and surreal.  Gotta love SURREALISM.  Especially if you have never DROPPED one.  If you like this album be sure to get the solo SYD.  Not very well produced(or even rehearsed), but outstanding!  Grab the OLd Mothers of Invention  --  ZAPPA RULES
B00000J7S8|1.0|Please people, this beautiful young lady has a five note range, cannot sing more than three words without taking a breath, and from time to time sings off key.  I can only assume that if you are still buying Ms. Krall's CD's that you already own all of Ella's recordings.
B000002C1V|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite Floyd cd's.  Yes it's DARK, but what a thrill it is to put the headphones on, dim the lights and dream to the concept of post war psychosis.  Paranoid Eyes is my utmost favorite track.  Next is Not Now John.  This disc is almost never heard of; especially to those annoying radio minded Pink Floyd fans.  It is time to expand your mind and CD collection and purchase this brilliant Roger Waters masterpiece.
B00005MKA1|5.0|Bob Marley's 1978 release &quot;Kaya&quot; has benefited from a new remastering that is as exquisite as the sweet songs that make up this collection. <br />Listening to the keyboards reverb between left and right channel on such timeless songs as &quot;Is This Love&quot; or &quot;Sun is Shining&quot; while a chorus of percussion softly pulsates back and forth makes this one of the very finest collections from Bob Marley and the Wailers. Junior Murvin's subtle guitar licks highlight turnarounds in each song. The vocal mixes are among the best ever from Bob abd the I Threes.<br />The remaster of this CD is exactly what one would expect with the instruments clearer, the bass more powerful, the mix given a lively feel that brings you closer to the source than ever before.  An already great collection that has been given a lift, it's worth noting these mellow riffs.
B000005RSW|5.0|The fourth release from America's most underrated band.  All Men Play on 10 is a wake-up call to the 80'sbogus hair &quot;I need a date&quot; wimpy bands.  Written for the commercial airwaves to RIDICULE Commercialism.  If anyone knows ManOwaR and what they stand for, they would defnitely enjoy this disc.  The Oath grabs your heart and sucks you into the realm of true metal.  The final song Guyana- in the cult of the damned,is by far one of their greatest masterpieces.
0887307280|5.0|The reason this is the best business book I have ever read is because it reveals to the reader why the reader does what he or she does. Inside you are three entities vying for control: an entrepreneur, a manager and a technician. Reading this book you will discover which one of these parts of you is running the show and why. Confused? Think of an overweight person. He or she has a fat person and a skinny person inside them. When the skinny person assumes control, it's salads and skinless chicken. When the fat person gets control it's banana splits and hot fudge. When the technician is at the helm in your life, you're separating paper clips or designing forms on the computer when you should be managing your job or out pursuing new clients. Get the picture? Realizing why you do, and don't do the things you should is profoundly enlightening. How much do I like this book? I buy several copies at a time to hand out to friends.
B00003CXN4|4.0|&quot;Traffic&quot; could possibly be the best film of 2000 - but at a cost.  director Soderbergh paints a grainy, black-and-white picture about the horrifying tales of drug trafficking, and it's nearly a masterpiece.  <BR>the sotryline is very complex and soemtimes even confusing - but the acting and cinematography make up for that.  &quot;Traffic&quot; explores every section of drugs: from the dealers, the kingpins, the governments trying to stop them, and even to the users themsleves.  <BR>&quot;Traffic&quot; is a very well-made, complex, and colorful film, i must say.  a winner of 4 Academy Awards, it has an all-star cast: Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, Benecio Del Toro (he won an Oscar), Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quiad, and more.  <BR>if you love great dramas and complex multi-character films, get the DVD of &quot;Traffic&quot; ASAP!
B00005MP58|3.0|I have loved this film since I watched it on A&amp;E on Saturday nights.  I have the box VHS tape set, but it is getting worn out so I purchased the DVD set.  <br />Other reviews have talked about the poor picture quality.  The film is very washed out, but if you have a good tv with lots of options, you can compensate for it.  It is annoying, but it doesn't make it worthless.
B00003CX95|5.0|this movie is great!  director Mel Gibson really proves himself with this film.  &quot;Braveheart&quot; won 5 Academy Awards - including Best Picture for 1995.<BR>Gibson's epic tells the story of William Wallace, the Scottish warrior who leads a revolt against English oppressors.  the acting is great, and the battle scenes are fantastic and surreal.  look past the blood and gore, and you've got a beautiful platter of sound, screenplay, costume deisgn, makeup, cinematography, and art - altogether a fabulous film.<BR>i almost cried at the end, but then i knew it was coming.  this is a must-have DVD!  personally, i don't like bloody films, but this movie is one of the few exceptions.
B000009EAD|5.0|I'm a child of the night too! &quot;Blessed Are You&quot; is for all the night fanatics. Finally, a great song about the night. This album has many dark evil night tunes. &quot;Burning Times&quot; is about the Spanish Inquistion. A lot of their tortures were done in the night. &quot;Reaping Stone&quot; is about an evil orb, but it takes place in the night. Forget the orb, just give me the NIGHT! NIGHT must always be shown in capital letters. Iced Earth has given me the greatest night album since 1987, with Savatag. NIGHT!
B00005N9CV|5.0|What more can be said after you say excellent. This is with out a doubt the best of Diana's CD's to date. If you like mellow smooth vocals of the standards you absolutely cannot beat this CD. If you don't buy it, you are truly missing the best CD of the year.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I think Rufus is very hard working guy. He is very popular. His family is too. Like Kate and Anna McGarrigle and his sister Martha. And of course Loudon Wainwright. But Rufus is very famous. Keep with the good work Rufus.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is absolutely superb.  Tool is one of the greatest mainstream rock bands in the history of the universe.  They have a sound like no other.  You think I'm exaggerating?  I'm not.  Buy the CD.  Listen to the songs, especially 'The Patient' and 'Lateralus'.  Prepare to be in awe.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Well, The Strokes is now the most hyped up band in the world..Thanks to British Press. But put that aside for now, and<BR>concentrate on music, shall we? What the strokes is not new and not old either.. What they do is take the sounds of 70's NYC punk and make it new again. So there is nothing wrong with that..<BR>The front man, Julian sounds like Lou Reed, and yet has a personna of Iggy Pop. His lyrics are arrogant, and sneering but can you ask for more? Their music are simply 3-chords song, no more than that.. And that's a real punk spirit, no gimmicks, no flashy stuff.. just pure a simple guitar riff. Even though, the entire LP runs about 36 minutes, it has no filler.. All 11 songs are very good. Beside, The Modern Age, and Hard To explain (Both of these have been released as single prior to their first LP.) Last Nite, Barely Legal, and Someday are likely to be next singles. However, there is one more thing that U.S. version album disappoints me.. New York City Cops is not included due to terrorist attack on NYC.. and The band don't want to offense anyone Too bad, american public can't hear the best strokes song<BR>unless they buy import version like I did.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is an amazing album!  The best I've ever heard.  This is just GREAT.  I especially like 'Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors', 'You And Whose Army' and 'Life In A Glasshouse'.  I love this album.  I love this band.
B000002R0R|2.0|I have never liked this album! I think side one is GG at their<br />least listenable, even tho' the chorus for,&quot; I'M TURNING AROUND&quot;<br />is very strong and may be the highlight of the album. Low points:<br />&quot;TWO WEEKS IN SPAIN&quot; and the embarassing rocker&quot; I BETCHA THOUGHT<br />WE COULDN'T DO IT&quot;. Side two is just a tad better than side one,<br />tho' it's rendered practically unlistenable by it's over pro-<br />duction. ME NO LIKE!!!
B00003CXWV|5.0|loved the movie! Johnny Depp is fabulous and keeps you on<BR>the edge of your seat. Music is awesome!
6305165912|5.0|Okay, so I'm addicted to Coen Brothers films. I've seen every one made and I'm proud to say that they are all fine pieces of work. Out of every Coen Bros. movie, my favorite by far is &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. Released in 1998, the movie became an instant cult hit and it's not hard to see why. <br />The story revolves around an aging hippie named Jeff Lebowski, otherwise known as the Dude. He's an unemployed, pot-smoking bowler who just so happens to have the same last name as a wealthy man. Bunny, the other Lebowski's wife (played by Tara Reid), owes money all over town, particularly to a known pornographer. The pornographer, thinking the Dude is the Lebowski he's after, sends some goons to collect money. After discovering that they have the wrong guy, the goons pee on the Dude's favorite rug. On top of that, Bunny is apparently kidnapped and the other Lebowski hires the Dude to drop the ringer and get her back. This starts a chain of events that introduces the Dude to toe-cutting Nihilists, weird artists and a slew of other interesting characters. Then there's the Dude's best bowling buddies, Walter (a short-tempered Vietnam vet) and Donnie (a shy pushover), played by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. It's so funny to watch Walter constantly berate Donnie for &quot;being out of his element&quot;. Out of all the characters in the movie, my favorite is Jesus Quintana, played by the ultratalented John Turturro. The scene where Quintana warns Walter about &quot;flashing a piece on the lane&quot; made me roll on the floor. It's a classic line. <br />This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Definantely worth the view and the buy. To all those like the Coen Brothers or just a good laugh in general, I have four words...Go Buy This Movie!!! You won't regret it.
B00005QGAX|4.0|even though this Album was my least Favorite in the Michael Jackson&amp;Quincy Jones Era Together this Project Here makes it better.&quot;Fly Away&quot; is a Tight Cut.once again i had much of the Material just now being Released but I still dig it combined with the Interviews.for anybody that digs MJ you gonna dig this.
B00005ABX0|4.0|These two albums are bound to confuse people. Even avid Beach Boy/Brian Wilson fans. How many times have you heard, in reference to these recordings, &quot;If you forget about the entire SMILE situation and focus on the recordings. . .&quot; Right, the problem is, that sounds great, but how can you ignore it?? Even if you try to, you won't. With all the mystery, intrigue, and (believe me) overrated hype surrounding Brian's lost masterpiece, it's almost impossible not to view these two albums, and really any BB album released after 1967, as post-SMILE. The track was dismantled, Brian the conductor shut the train down really dang quickly, and now he joined the other guys as they calmly walked the rest of the way (sometimes he stopped to sleep of course).<br />Seriously, if you don't view SMILEY SMILE as the aborted &quot;bunt instead of a grand slam,&quot; if you have no idea of the music Brian had been making, the promises and hopes that had been building and building for nearly a year, if all you knew was that first the Beach Boys released PET SOUNDS and then they released this, you would probably find yourself staring at your stereo, a look of sheer confusion, double-checking the jewel case to make sure you didn't accidentally pick up the wrong album. SMILEY SMILE is simply weird. You can try as much as you'd like to say &quot;it still has its moments&quot; (and it does), but the bottom line is, this is not a terribly good album. It's just weird. Some of the vocals are incredible. &quot;With Me Tonight&quot; is majestic. &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; remains the same, incredible pop symphony it was when they released it in '66. &quot;Heroes And Villains&quot; comes off okay, despite some very obvious edits and sequences. The rerecorded &quot;Wonderful&quot; is really nice, and would probably be viewed in a nicer light were there not other, easily accessible recordings from the SMILE sessions available to color opinions. The album comes off as one big fraternity joke.They were all smoking something, God knows what, the primary instrumentation is Brian's prized organ (and of course some wonderful vocals), and the album's stronger songs lyrically (mostly thanks to Van Dyke Parks) are marred by this profound sense of insanity! It's one of my favorite Beach Boy albums, because it's so interesting to analyze, but really when you get past the fascination, it's not a good record! (I say that with real humor too.) I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find a stranger Beach Boys record, but really, this was just the beginning. . .<br />WILD HONEY, on the other hand, is a great album, right up there with other Beach Boy classics of its time. The R&amp;B sound is teriffic, highlights include Brian's romping &quot;Here Comes The Night,&quot; the radio tune &quot;Darlin&quot; (written for Three Dog Night), &quot;Let The Wind Blow&quot; (just beautiful), the title track, and &quot;How She Boogalooed It,&quot; notable for being the first original BB piece not written by Brian. Carl gets to really strut his stuff on this album, and Brian's honkey-tonk piano is also a standout. The final track, &quot;Mama Says,&quot; is pretty funky too. This CD comes with some highly invaluable bonus material, you must check it out. Probably the most interesting CD in the Capitol catalogue. Check it out, but seriously-- it's a bloody weird time!!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|what can you say about this Album that already hasn't been said?the cool thing is gettign the Interviews&amp;Demos.I had &quot;Carousal&quot; some time ago.this Album  is still  the  Forerunner of what's happening now.very detailed&amp;I'm glad I got this.Enjoy.
B000051VWW|2.0|I like Sade.  I don't like this disc.  There are three songs I really love.  You can throw the rest of this out.  Sade sounds great.  The songs are bad and the accompanying music is awful.  This is Sade with a drum machine.  The songs don't even have enough to allow her to put them over.  The first song is Country and Western Sade.  Not flattering to her at all.  I can't really express how bad this is.  I do not compare discs to other discs the performer puts out.  This disc stands on its own.  It is bad music by itself.  If you like Sade, don't buy this.  You won't like it.  She is forcing herself to sing this stuff and is very uninterested in what she is singing.  I don't blame her.
B00005QGAT|5.0|MJ gets a Nice Touch Up Here with Demos&amp;Interviews talking about the Magic Vibe of this Great album.if you don't already have it then get it.this is Classic MJ From start to finish.Highly Enjoyable.this Album hasn't Lost it's Touch Nearly 25 Years Later.

B000000WA2|4.0|Having not become a Blur fan until last year, this was their third album I bought, after &quot;Parklife&quot; and &quot;Blur&quot;.  I was very impressed at first.  I thought songs such as &quot;Country House&quot; and &quot;Charmless Man&quot; were the quintessence of great Britpop, and wondered why they changed their sound on &quot;Blur&quot; (my least favorite of their albums).  But after listening to it, they became my least favorite songs on the album, and there wasn't a consistent run of great songs like on &quot;Parklife&quot; or &quot;Modern Life is Rubbish&quot;.  It became clear that they had grown tired of being Britpop kings, and the ensuing pissing contest it caused with Oasis made Damon and Co. realize that it just wasn't worth it.<br />Why 4 stars then?  Because if you look beyond the singles, you will find some truly great downbeat songs on the album, notably &quot;Best Days&quot;, &quot;He Thought of Cars&quot;, and the stunning &quot;Yuko and Hiro&quot;.  There were also some great more uptempo songs, such as &quot;Stereotypes&quot;, &quot;It Could Be You&quot;, and the dance-infected &quot;Entertain Me&quot;.<br />So, I would say buy &quot;Parklife&quot;, &quot;13&quot;, and &quot;MLIR&quot; before this, but if you've got those, it's Blur, which means it will always be better than 90% of whatever else is out there.
B000021YQV|5.0|The sophomore album from these Ozzfest vets is fast, loud, and a lot more provocative than most of their peers' output. There's a post-goth appeal to the music, which veers between black thrash and nomadic prog, and Serj Tankian is an appealingly dynamic frontman. There are moments of nu-metal excess, and at times it's heavy for heavy's sake, but on its core cuts (like the slippery &quot;Chop Suey&quot;) Toxicity is indeed lethal stuff.
B000002KIE|5.0|Yes this is was and will allways be the best lp of all time, it is punk at its best! Johnny Rotten voice is what punk vocals are all about, Steve Jones' ear spliting gutiar work, and Sid the image of punk! There is no other punk album that comes near the Sex Pistols. Classic songs like &quot;EMI&quot;,&quot;Holiday in the sun&quot;,&quot;God save the Queen&quot; and &quot;seventeen&quot; will live on in rock and roll history forever. GOD SAVE THE SEX PISTOLS!!!
B000007T1M|5.0|Very original band.  A worthy purchase.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The movie is excellent, supurb, a masterpiece.  And the DvD is just as good.  Starting from the fake warning when u pop it into ur player.  To the loads of hidden eggs.  The commentary is the best ive heard in awhile.  If u want to know more about fight club listen to it.  David Fincher tells u alot of the things that are unclear.  Such as the Narrators name.  he doesnt have one.  the DvD mirrors the movie's pretence. It keeps u wondering. second guessing.  ...this dvd will please everyone.
B0000508U6|4.0|After hearing Coldplay's smash single &quot;Yellow&quot; for the past year, I finally bought &quot;Parachutes&quot;. I gave in, let's say. I liked Travis' &quot;The Man Who&quot;, and I dig the whole British rock scene now, so I gladly plunked down the $15.<BR>Listening to the first track &quot;Don't Panic&quot; was a breath of fresh air. I've never felt such an impact from a Track 1 before. At least, not since...I don't remember. Anyway, Chris Martin's voice is very inviting. It sucks you in. The lyrics are melancholy yet so sweet. Hope and love is explained in every song. &quot;Trouble&quot; is executed perfectly, striking the perfect chords. The piano is definitely a centerpiece on this album, and is all the better. &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; is a favorite track of mine. The last minute of it is just beautiful. Hell, this whole album is beautiful. Buy it.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Besides being able to finally see &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy crystal clear, (it looks so good, u cant even tell its made in the 1970's), the extras are amazing!  The Corleon family tree and documentaries are terrific!  buy it!
B00000K31V|4.0|This stars Jennifer Jason Leigh (Dolores Claiborne), Jude Law (Gattaca) and Willem Dafoe (Speed 2, Affliction) challenge the boundaries of reality in this futuristic, critically acclaimed adventure thriller! During the first closed-door demonstration of an amazing new virtual reality game - called eXistenZ - the system's brilliant designer, Allegra Geller (Leigh), is violently attacked by a crazed assassin intent on killing her and destroying her creation! Forced to flee into hiding, Allegra enlists a young assistant (Law) to help her in testing the damaged system...by convincing him to join her inside eXistenZ! The action then explodes as their world's real-life dangers begin to merge with the fantasy of the game! If you're ready to play, it's now your turn to plug into this powerfully entertaining hit!<br />This movie was overshadowed by another movie called The Matrix, but I liked this one a little more, its mystery plot drove it to great links.  While some of the questions are unawnsered (like why the hell is eXistenZ littered with werid looking amphibains that get mangled up) at the end they are dissmisable.<br />Good story, acting, and direction keeps you guessing all the way till the end and even when you look back to think about it.
6305165912|5.0|Jeff &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski is a bowler mistaken by a duo of mobsters for Jeff Lebowski, the millionaire. They demand repayment of a loan &quot;The Dude&quot; knows nothing about. While he tries to explain their mistake, the millionaire's daughter is kidnapped, and the kidnappers send her severed toe in the mail with a ransom note.<br />This is somewhat the plot of the movie.  I say some what because the Coen Brothers (makers of Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou, Blood Simple) let the actors show off 1st then they move onto the plot.  The plot is behind the acting, directing, and score to this orginal comedy.<br />The actors make this movie.  Jeff Bridges is literaly the Dude.  His only worried about his car, bowling, and drinking White Russians.  He is spaced through out most of the movie....simply Oscar worthy.  Walter is played by the big intemidating John Goodman.  Walter is a vet who relates everything back to the war and simi-die hard Jew.  Every time he yeld at Donny to &quot;Shut the _____ up!&quot; I started cracking up.  Donny is played by Steve Busimmi in a small role but you love him anyway.  Other noteworthy people are: Philp Seymore Hoffman, Tera Reid, Sam Elliot, and Julian Moore.<br />So like I said the charecters make this movie, but in the same sense could break it if you don't like or can't relate to them.  With that said enjoy this highly entertaning pice of comical brillence that it is.
B00002E233|2.0|The two stars are for the DVD.  This DVD looks good, sounds great and comes with some cool extras.  The DVD is flawed in one area....the movie it comes with.<br />The movie is an utter bore fest.  Nothing to look foward to besides CGI sharks, if that tickles your fancy then your in for a treat, but if you enjoy good acting, sespence, action, horror, directing, and script you should most look eleswhere.  I didn't care for one single person in this movie.  They deserved it.  The surprise death in the movie didn't fool me....I saw it coming, like I said Boring.<br />The direction has been done better else where.  The tension is just lost when I see an lame and crappy CGI shark coming at someone....eat them, who cares.  I will give this to them the death animation when the shark rip apart someone are perrty cool, but that is all to look forward to in this otherwise borring movie.
B00003CY0V|4.0|John Travolta stars as Gabriel Shear, a sinister mastermind with an elite criminal crew who are desperately trying to access information locked inside a complicated computer system that contains government secrets and if they can hack it... a $9 billion payday. That is the backbone of this hightech action film of the summer.<br />This movie has explosions, cool acting, and ... They paid Halle Berry a lot of money to flash her bad boys and let me say it was money well spent.<br />Enough with that... though, this movie has some dialoge that may get to the compter people out there. Some of you may laugh but the rest of use wouldn't know so its dismissable.<br />As far as acting goes, everyone is enjoyable. Jackman could be the next action star and you get a smile watching Travolta have fun as the badguy.<br />This moive has a cool script, cool techno music, and good directing with some killer FX (everyone must see the explosion at the start of the movie, it was one of the best FX this summer) and stunts. The story holds you with mystery and intrige and never lets go. All around good mindless fun.
B00005QIPH|4.0|The recent interest in The Strokes, instead of being the usual product of incessant, relentless major-label overpromotion, is due more to a grassroots, word-of-mouth frenzy, thanks largely to the now defunct Napster. When their phenomenal 'The Modern Age' ep came out in the UK in late 2000, its three hyperdriven songs were being swapped on the internet. Then, this past spring, another UK single, 'Hard To Explain', was a big hit, and their stature amongst file-swappers grew even more. When Napster crashed and burned, other file sharing programs allowed the hype to build, until people like myself had the entire new album on mp3 long before it was finally released. All the praise in the magazines only confirms what we listeners knew some ten months ago: The Strokes are very much for real.<br />Comparisons have been made countless times this year to describe The Strokes' sound: Velvet Underground, Television, Stooges, and even the Yardbirds are just a few of the bands that have been name-dropped. The bottom line is The Strokes are rock &amp; roll in its purest form: raw, emotional, snide, visceral, recorded in a lo-fi style that mirrors other classic debuts, like ones by The Ramones, Pavement, and The Clash. The energy on the record is palpable; instead of relying on buzzsaw guitars that so many American bands use as a crutch, mistaking distortion for genuine feeling, you can hear guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. ferociously strumming their guitars like their lives depended on it. Mix that in with frenzied but intricate drumming, refreshingly creative basslines, impassioned vocals by frontman and chief songwriter Julian Casablancas, and production that sounds like it was recorded in a sweaty, smelly basement, and you have something real special.<br />All eleven songs are extraordinary. The title track is a Pavement-styled slow song; 'Someday', 'Take It Or Leave It', and Last Nite' are high-energy, fun songs. The real highlights, though, are the songs thathave been on fans' hard drives for most of the year: 'Hard To Explain' is one of the catchier songs that has moments that sound amazingly like early U2, while 'The Modern Age' and 'Barely Legal', whose rearrangement vastly outshines the sloppy ep version, are made great by Casablancas'<BR>vocal talents.<br />The album is great, but there are a couple of gripes. First off, the version of 'The Modern Age' is a step slower than the version from the earlier ep, and although the album version is tighter, it doesn't have the ferocious energy that makes the previous recording sound a lot like a three-minute version of the Velvets' 'Sister Ray'. Also, 'NYC Cops', a tongue-in-cheek rocker that echoes the dry humour of The Ramones, was yanked out of sensitivity to victims of the Sept. 11 bombings, fearing a huge public backlash, in favour of the more new-wave 'When It Started'. 'NYC Cops' is the better song, and while its omission was sensible for the time being, a year from now people in New York will be questioning authority again, and the absence of the satirical song will look trite. Look for it to appear in a special edition in 25 years, like The Ramones' 'Carbona Not Glue'.<br />But those are small complaints. Is This It is a phenomenal first album, and is by far one of the best albums of the year. Will it save rock music? No, but it shows there's room for new American bands with real originality and creativity. If this does spawn a new movement of old-fashioned guitar rock, we'll be all the better for it. In the meantime, sit back, hit the repeat button on your cd player, and dig the heck out of this amazing album.
0790729725|5.0|I am a fan of La Cosa Nostra and I think I have seen and read all there is out there.  This movie is great!  In fact that's an understatement.  DeNiro and Pesci are unbelievable!  Liotta is fantastic! A MUST SEE!
B00005A46T|4.0|Way back in the Eighties, there were several metal albums so astounding they remain personal favourites to this day: Metallica's Master Of Puppets, Iron Maiden's Live After Death, Slayer's Reign In Blood, and Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime, to name a few. Heavy music has changed so much these days that singing merely about Samuel Taylor Coleridge, H.P. Lovecraft, Reaganomics, and old reliable Satan himself sounds sorely out of date. What's left to sing about is nothing but a load of whiny introspective tripe, but with their phenomenal debut, and their new album Iowa, Slipknot prove they are the true masters of<BR>cashing in on their own misery.<br />Slipknot have this teen angst thing nailed down...as Bart Simpson once said, it's like shooting fish in a barrel. They're not idiots. Today's Gen-Y Global Teens have pop lolitas and boy groups for the kids, cheeky 'punk' bands for future frat boys, boring trance music for the ravers, sophomoric rap for the suburbanite gangstas, and yes, doom rock for the bottom-of-the-barrel misfits, all carefully marketed and packaged. What sets Slipknot above boring white-boy metal rappers and cartoony acts like Mudvayne and Gwar is their absolute, undeniable conviction and tight metal musicianship.<br />Iowa would be half the album it is if it were not for the efforts of Ross Robinson and Andy Wallace (Wallace mixed Slayer's classic Reign In Blood). The duo are able to combine powerful vocals, two guitars, an extraordinary drummer, a bassist, two percussionists, and two samplers, creating such a monolithic sonic wall of hell, making it, bar none, the greatest-sounding metal album I have ever heard, and I've heard a lot of them.<br />Although the use of the ubiquitous eff-werd is repeated ad infinitum, vocalist Corey Taylor shows some creative growth on Iowa. 'My Plague', 'Heretic Anthem', 'Metabolic', and the searing 'I Am Hated' show that he's capable of more than nonsensical bellyaching. Slipknot's incredible musical chops are evident on songs like the frantic 'People=S**t' and 'Disasterpiece'. The album's epic title track is a bit of a departure, and is equally thrilling and disturbing, a kind of nu-metal blues jam that lasts a good fifteen minutes.<br />Like their debut cd, Slipknot are again guilty of not knowing when to quit. Iowa is ten or fifteen minutes too long; 'Left Behind', while possessing amazing production, is an obvious single stuck in to get some radio airplay and sell more units, and 'Skin Ticket' says nothing that Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral didn't say seven years ago. Something with such extreme content should be shortened... that's what makes something like the 28-minute Reign In Blood so memorable.<br />Though not as explosive as the previous album, Iowa is a terrific piece of work. I'm simply amazed at the intensity. However, I'm worried that some poor, misguided kid somewhere will misinterpret the lyrics and take out his or her frustrations the wrong way. I've always been against musical censorship, but any parent out there who hears this music coming from their kid's bedroom should make sure the kid has his or her head screwed on straight. For every ten kids who dig this album for its visceral power, there will always be one who'll take it all a bit too seriously. The other day I put on Iron Maiden's The Number Of The Beast, and found myself longing for the days when metal bands sang about the old Prisoner tv show, Native Americans, and the Book of Revelations. It all seems so harmless now.

B00005K9QP|5.0|If you've never heard this album then this remaster is the best way to hear it. It's clean, has good separation and features two<BR>bonus tracks recorded by John and Eric. Now for the anorak, trainspotting details of WHY this album is important. Quite simply, as far as tone, technique and temperament, Eric Clapton at this time was revolutionary. In the guitar world there are two periods; BB (Before &quot;Bluesbreakers&quot;) and AB  (After &quot;Bluesbreakers&quot;). First, tone. NO ONE had this kind of overdriven, aggressive and harmonically rich sound before 1966.<BR>Literally, what we associate with rock/blues guitar sound for the last 35 years can be traced back to the tones Clapton was getting in '66. Second, technique. Imagine yourself as young <BR>person in England at this time and you've discovered the great American blues guitarists like B.B. and Freddie King but figure<BR>you will never see them unless you go to America. Then you hear about AN ENGLISHMAN your age who can play that way, plus add<BR>something of his own. Third, temperament. Eric Clapton was able<BR>at young age to both tap into a vastly different world (that of the African-American middle aged bluesman)and supply his own <BR>revolutionary ideas about how the elecrtic guitar could be played. Revolutionary is right. People forget about that all the time but in 1966 Clapton changed everything. It is a tribute to his basic sanity after all these years and personal problems that<BR>he DIDN'T try and continually live up to that standard. He did<BR>other things. Most musicians never have the opportunity to revo-<BR>lutionize anything and very very few can do it more than once.<BR>Whenever anyone looks disparagingly on Eric Clapton's career, and<BR>he had some low points it's true, all I have to say is &quot;Bluesbreakers&quot;.
B0000035GN|5.0|here's the deal.....bands evolve, they change, and though the sebadoh that is heard on bakesale is very different from the sebadoh on a say, III, or even bubble and scrape, it is still one of the finest bands out there. bakesale is an incredibly cohesive effort, its not at all schizophrenic like some of the earlier work....lou tackles the personal issues here, self image, love and loss, etc. i think the thing that makes the album so good however, is that jason's songs are finally fully realized and fully listenable. it seemed before he was always just a record behind lou, but here, he really comes into his own, in fact, penning the albums best tune (s. soup) of course the lou stuff is great too: check out not a friend, skull, and together or alone.....i've probably listened to this album once a week since i first bought it my freshman year of h.s....and i didn't exactly whip through college. timeless stuff.
0679409998|5.0|Written almost two centuries ago, Shelley's science-fiction/horror novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; retains its powerful messages and questions to this very day.<br />A devoted scientist, Victor Frankenstein, attempts to return to life a body he has constructed from various human parts.  He succeeds, only to realize the hideousness of his creation, and subsequently flee.<br />Confused but sympathetic, Frankenstein's monster finds himself shunned by humans.  Eventually, a series of tragedies turns him against humanity, and he turns his thoughts to seeking revenge on his creator for not providing him with either protection or companionship.  Meanwhile, Frankenstein is determined to protect himself and his family, while removing his mistake from the world.  The two spend the latter portion of the novel in a drawn-out duel, spiralling towards misery for both of them.<br />Shelley's work raises profound questions about the limits of science, its requirements for wisdom as well as intelligence, the responsibilities of parents, and the nature of revenge - quite an accomplishment for a novel of only 250 pgs.  Highly recommended.
B000002HPT|5.0|A good friend of mine told me that this cd is for the less &quot;prog&quot; oriented mind. While this may be true in some respects, it is a great cd none the less. The tracks New Millenium, Lines in the Sand and Trail of Tears are the great, long songs we've all come to excpect out of Dream Theater. Lines in the Sand is preceeded by a great instrumental piece &quot;Hell's kitchen,&quot; which incorporates some wild overlapping rythms between guitar, bass and drums and has some extremely memorable solos and melodies. It builds into a great crescendo, which helps it flow into Lines in the Sand. Perhaps one of the most touching tracks is &quot;Take Away my Pain&quot;, great lyrics and melody, and John rips out a solo that goes straight to the heart. Bottomline: This album is great and seems like it has something for everyone.

1878424319|2.0|This book sounded very promising.  The four agreements are worthy ideas, but Ruiz does not expand upon them in any concrete or practical way.  I was surprised at the generally poor quality of the writing.  I was particularly turned off by two things:  First, the 23-page introduction is based on the presumption that the socialization of human beings is 100% bad.  I think that basic courtesy, which does not require the complete sacrifice of the self, is a good thing!  Second, in the eighth paragraph of chapter 2 (The First Agreement), the author attempts to make the case that the words we use can actually cast spells on other people.  He writes, &quot;We cast spells all the time with our opinions.  An example:  I see a friend and give him an opinion that just popped into my mind.  I say, 'Hmmm!  I see that kind of color in your face in people who are going to get cancer.'  If he listens to the word, and if he agrees, he will have cancer in less than one year.  That is the power of the word.&quot;  Ruiz offers nothing further to support what seemed to me to be an outrageous assertion.  He lost me right there.

B00004YKUY|5.0|This cd, Arrival sticks with the style that Journey has created throughout the years.  With Steve Augeri as Journey's new frontman puts to rest all the speculation of him being able to fill Steve Perry's shoes.  If you saw any one of the concerts this summer you would say the same.  Songs like Higher Place, Livin' to Do, Kiss Me Softly are just a few of the awesome songs put out by this legendary band. This would be a must have CD for any fan of Journey music.  Just go into their website and check out all the comments fans have left. After 20+ years of enjoying Journey, The new cd just keeps me lovin' them.
B000002MJC|5.0|I'm sort of a born-again DM fan, meaning that although I bought a couple of their albums and enjoyed them on the radio, I only recently become seriously interested in their music.<br />Sometimes when I hear other DM albums, I wish I could take a few songs off or add a few songs on.  As much as I love Exciter and as much as I adore Martin Gore's angellic voice, I would be plenty happy without &quot;Comatose&quot;, and though I love &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; and &quot;Dead of Night&quot;, they don't fit with the rest of the album.  And while Violator seems to be the favorite of most fans, I find it a somewhat uneven album, with a transitional sound that clings to the more simplistic synth-pop methods of the past even as it tries to reach for the future of more confident melodies.  Except for &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, Violator really doesn't break any ground that Music For the Masses didn't already cover.<br />Songs of Faith and Devotion, on the other hand, is a musical and thematic masterpiece.  Gore's lyrics have never been better; these are the songs with which he comes of age as a writer.  It's also the closest thing DM has done to a &quot;concept album&quot;.  It plays almost like an opera (don't let that turn you off if you're not into opera).  By that, I just mean that from start to end, it takes you through a story, filled with themes of faith, betrayal, temptation, and redemption.  At the end of it, you feel like you've been on a journey.  It's really breath-taking.<br />You don't need to be a DM fan to enjoy this album.  Toss aside your preconceptions of Mode as a silly synth-pop band with a good rhyming dictionary and give this darker, grittier and ultimately more enlightening album a try.

This movie grabs you and doesn't let go, even after the film is over.  I read the book.  It is the greatest book I have ever read.  This is my favorite movie.  The book and the movie aren't even the same thing -- so don't put the movie down.  The picture and sound quality is excellent, and the documentary before the film is awesome.  This is the great horror film ever (tied with Evil Dead -- you should check it out).  YOu must buy or rent this DVD.
0743216458|5.0|I have to say this is the one of the best book's I have ever read.  I literally could not put it down. Stephen Ambrose really did his homework on this one, and his attention to detail puts you right in the foxhole with the men of Easy Company.  If you have watched the HBO Mini-Series, than you must read the book.
B00001NFCY|3.0|Creed's &quot;Human Clay&quot; is an ok cd. I liked some of the songs but the cd is certainly nothing to get exited about. It is true. Creed sounds like bad pearl jam. There is NO WAY people can compare Mr. Scott Stapp with Eddie Vedder. Pearl Jam are ten times better musicians than Creed is. some idiot said here that Scott stapp sings his lyrics with more heart and soul that Eddie Vedder does. I hope he is joking! Eddie Vedder is the king when it comes to express emotions and feelings in his songs. (listen to black!) Eddie is exceptional on what he does! Scott is so far just a mimic. Hope Creed can build up some more potential in their next release. They sound good and play hard. We will soon see..
B000058TDY|5.0|get this album, in my opinion it is one of cats best, incredible mix of lyrics, impact, and melody will amazing you.  If you are like me and listen to music for lyrical content and catchy songs get the album and everyother catstevens album, he is the best EVER!!!
080017948X|4.0|Great family movie.  We watched it again last night with our 9 year old.  Everybody enjoyed it.  It is funny and sweet.  Classic Bill Murray.  Andie MacDowell is lovely.
B00005KFUM|4.0|Ladies and Gentlemen, its time to throw your preconceptions away. Seemingly unwilling to accept their fate as perennial silver-medallists in the angst-rock Olympic Games behind the all-conquering Radiohead, Muse have sidestepped this avenue altogether, and the results might leave you needing to catch your breath.<BR>     Origin Of Symmetry, while maintaining the Muse traits of elbow-gnawing pretension and Matt Bellamy's eardrum shattering falsetto, is a work with such intense vision and grandiose spectacle that only the terminally unimaginative could fail to be bowled over. The piledriver riffs of Plug In Baby and Newborn crash thorugh your consciousness while the band scale heights of operatic splendour that few bands would even attempt, most notably on the crashing sonic earthquake that is album finale Megalomaniac, which renders even the most dramatic Queen anthem prosaic in comparison.<BR>      True, the bands all-pervading ambition does manifest itself occasionally in a lack of direction, with most recent single Bliss seemingly devoid of anything even remotely resembling a tune, but these rare lapses are emphatically cancelled out by the insane axe-wielding mayhem of Citizen Erased and the altogether remarkable piano histrionics of Space Dementia. <BR>     You may struggle to suppress a giggle as Bellamy howls his way through Plug In Baby's manic conclusion, or raise a quizical eyebrow at the unusual interpretation of Nina Simeone classic Feeling Good, but with music of such cathartic energy, you'll hardly fail to be impressed. Pretension was never so much fun.
B000059XUI|3.0|Dick Lester is a fine director...but this film belonged to Richard Donner, and it was vandalized and ruined.  This film suffers greatly in comparison with its predecessor..it has a few moments of interest, which apparently were filmed before the Salkinds fired Richard Donner.<br />The rest of it just doesn't match how Superman is defined in Superman: The Movie. First, the invasion of earth by the three criminals differs in dialog and tone from the first film. Note that \\"different\\" in this case means \\"worse\\". Second, the film just doesn't manage the suspension of disbelief of the first. We'll ignore the fact that Superman exists, can fly etc. For example, what are people doing walking and talking on the moon?<br />In the first film, Superman existed but the rest of the world generally followed physical laws. In the second, we're asked to believe that people can have conversations in a complete (or nearly complete) lunar vacuum.  And why write in an outer space nuclear explosion when there was already one from the first film (the Hackensack nuke)?  Clearly someone (Salkind and Spengler?) had it in for Dick Donner's material.<br />Unfortunately, the scenes filmed by Donner (most of the Fortress of Solitude scenes, anything with Gene Hackman) are just different stylistically from Richard Lester's material. The odd snappy dialog in Metropolis (a la Mankiewicz) is completely gone...the formal Kryptonian delivery is also missing.  It just feels different in comparison to Superman I, and it's not welcome. I hope that one day this film can be reedited under Richard Donner's supervision - there's a great fantasy film in here somewhere.
B00000ILBK|4.0|I have read alot about the creation of all the Star Trek movies and the reason I enjoy this movie is because of what they did.  The producers knew they could not top First Contact, so they went for a different tone of film.  They also stretched their arms and filmed outside.  Because of ILM creating The Phantom Menace at the time, and the huge budget for location shooting, they had to go with a different effects company.  The effects look good, but they are far from Star Trek fan standards.  I give this movie credit of the fact that they did not reuse scenes from other Trek films...some of the best Trek films have saved money by rehashing old shots (ST2, ST4, ST5, Generations).  Insurrection, with its limited budget and alternate ending, did not reuse ANY shots.  The soundtrack is great and the holoship scenes are the best parts of the film.  <br />It is an enjoyable film and gave the TNG crew a chance to have some fun, but it does not have an ending suitable to this crew.<BR>The movie was rushed and it seemed that they only told you half of the story they could have, but remember its an odd movie!  This movie they had to do so they could get to Star Trek X.
B000009QPE|5.0|Ten tracks and 28 minutes that changed the world. A maelstrom of pounding drums, fretboard-burning guitar work, rumbling bass and tortured vocals. And the songs! &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;, &quot;Postmortem&quot; - need I say more? This album was recorced in 1986, but in the fifteen years since it's release no-one has been able to top it. Sepultura tried and came damn close with &quot;Beneath The Remains&quot;. An absolute classic, and you can't really call yourself a metalhead if you don't own it.

B00005A46T|4.0|This the second full-length album from Slipknot sees them going in a completely different direction than other bands in their genre. Instead of piling on the grooves and rapping, they have added more and more elements of death- and black metal, making this an interesting ride. A good production and a collection of fine songs - &quot;Heretic Anthem&quot; being a favorite - makes this a very fine record indeed. And Slipknot still know how to swing.
B000002UC5|5.0|Personally my favorite of Paul's solo albums. Paul's first non-Beatles album is also his most heart-felt. Though some might complain about the off-beat tunes, I personally find them inspirational. The songs were recorded at the end of the Beatles-era, and several of the tunes reflect Paul's feelings over the impending breakup. I relate to the feel of many of the tunes, &quot;Singalong Junk&quot;, for example, is very comforting on a bad day. A must have for any McCartney fan.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Snow White is one of the greatest animated films of all time, and thus deserves the golden treatment for DVD. For once, the home video department at Disney doesn't fail us.<br />Both discs included allow you to fully understand the process behind making Snow White. Areas like the Abandoned Concepts, Deleted Scenes, and the Camera Tests are all fasinating. The archival radio recordings and trailers too are a great look at the past.<br />I do have to note that some of the extras glorify Disney (the company) maybe a little much. The &quot;Disney Through the Decades&quot; extra is wasted, what with Jodi Benson and Ming-Na telling us how great it is that Disney has their own hockey team and such.<br />But dispite these flaws, Snow White is still a must own disc. The film still holds as a classic, and the extras are definately worth checking out. There may be better DVDs, but I honestly can't think of any off the top of my head.
0345413377|1.0|C.S. Lewis wannabe, Philip Pullman, has got my back up by rejecting Christianity if favor of a formula Sword and Sorcery tale.  You know the formula.  The youthful pilgrim saves a world by gathering together an odd collection of creatures, including a pretty girl, and trekking to hell and back beset by creepy critters.<br />Please bear with me while I define some terms.<br />It seems to me that while Philip has read Paradise Lost, he has NOT read the Bible.<br />Paradise Lost is a work of fiction written by an individual.  In Paradise Lost Satan is painted as the \\"bloody but unbowed\\" champion of human curiosity, intelligence and determination.  God is portrayed as an arbitrary despot.<br />The Bible is a collection of national history, poetry, parable, letters, wisdom, etc, etc. etc.  written down by a wide variety of individuals over hundreds of years.  If you read the Bible from cover to cover, there seems to be a amazing consensus that God is a creative, caring, just, endlessly patient (with occasional fits of exasperation) Being.  God is shown to have provided Jesus and the Holy Spirit so that He is NOT a remote, unfathomable, creature.  Those who turn to Him find God loves them and accepts them right where they are.  Guidance for the fallible people of the real world is provided.<br />The Bible is a survival manual with really good interesting stories.  In the newer portion of it a youthful hero saves our world by trekking to hell and back.  (There are some fascinating individuals and creatures, but sorry, no pretty girl for this hero - try the earlier part, Song of Solomon, for romance.)  By and large, it's a much better read than Amber Spyglass. If you are looking for the meaning of life, you are much more likely to find it in the Bible than Amber Spyglass.<br />In the Bible, as opposed to Paradise Lost, Satan is described as the devourer, deceiver, and a regular \\"evil-doer\\" with no redeeming social or moral value.  He tempts humanity into the heresy that we can gain true wisdom without knowing God.  He is NOT described as a misunderstood questor after knowledge who was dumped out of heaven for being uppity.<br />Now I abhor anti-intellectuals as much as the next literate person, but valuing metaphysics and striving to see the really BIG picture does not exclude science and learning for the joy of satisfying curiosity.  On the contrary, it INcludes them.<br />As for the virtues of \\"thinking, and feeling and reflecting, gaining wisdom and passing it on, kindness, patience, cheerfulness, and curiosity.\\"  What do you suppose impressed them upon our &quot;I want what I want when I want it!&quot; western society, starting with the Romans, as virtues in the first place? - Christianity!<br />In the Bible we are given a history of the tidal ebb and flow of the relationship between God and humankind.  In Amber Spyglass we are given zephyrs of spooky-dust!  You choose which to read.can gain true wisdom without knowing God.

B000000WJZ|5.0|I love this CD.  It's full of terrific guitar and I have an easier time than most with Billy Corgans voice.  In my opinion this is one of the greatest CD's of the 90's.  I just can't put it any other way.  The songs are full of energy and are just plain good.
0061040967|5.0|The Last Hero was everything I was hoping for in Paul Kidby's illustration.  If you're a Diskworld fan, the story explores the gods and Leonard of Quirm in much more depth than I think they've ever been in the novels.  The illustrative style of the book realy becomes the only way to view Leonard, and his way of thinking and creating.  Aside from the character art and exploration, the book evokes a true sense of awe for an imaginary world that inspires wonder in our own.

B00005QIPH|3.0|Curious case, the Strokes.  The British music press have fallen all over themselves in heaping praise upon them.  Their Stateside counterparts are catching on as even Newsweek has heralded the release of their debut LP.  As Spin recently poignantly and correctly asserted, more people have heard of the Strokes than have actually heard them.<br />Until now, perhaps.  After a bit of a delay in retooling the album in the wake of the events of September 11, Is This It has been released, allowing the public a full-fledged opportunity to check out the band on record beyond an EP and a single, both released earlier this year in limited circulation.  The album crashed in the charts at a glorious #74 position.  I'm guessing the CBGB scenesters propelled it to such heights.  <br />So what does Is This It reveal about the group for those of us who dwell far beyond the Lower East Side? Well, the band wears its myriad influences on their collective sleeve.  And the rest of their shirt, pants, shoes and whatever other piece of clothing adorns them.  Let's see, there's a healthy dose of the Velvets, Television, Blondie, Iggy (hey, a non-NYC touchstone!), as well as just about every pre-punk, proto-punk and new wave band that has festered in NYC.  Let's just say this is the sound of a band who could've been holding court at CBGB any time between '77 and '81.<br />As far as whether or not the Strokes deliver the goods, I think it depends on one's take on the band's homage to and pastiche of the aforementioned influences.  I think they do a credible job of conjuring the spirit of Lower East past.  Barely Legal, Someday and Last Nite (currently in slow rotation on MTV) are fairly ace tunes, with Someday being the cream of the crop.  The thing with me, though, is why settle for this facsimile when you can go back to the sources?  Marquee Moon, Loaded and even Parallel Lines are far better records with far superior tunes.<br />And therein lies the biggest snag with the Strokes.  Their material doesn't quite match their mettle.  While they have effectively copped the feel, fashion and spirit of the CBGB heyday, Is This It finds the band failing to match the quality of the work of that era's premier groups.  I'm not sure if it's a case of the weight of their influences being too heavy to bare or if frontman and sole songwriter Julian Casablancas just hasn't developed the talent to whip up strong enough material, but this album doesn't live up to the proverbial hype.<br />Maybe it's just that this Southern redneck just doesn't get it.  Maybe the British press are bang on with their glowing appraisals.  I mean, it's not like they are given to hyperbole every once in a while, are they?
B00004Z459|5.0|The first song I heard on this CD was &quot;Runaway&quot;. When I heard it, I wasn't really into that kind of music, but I thought it was cool anyway.<br />Then a friend introduced me to it even more by bringing it to my house and playing it for me. I kept getting more and more into it.<br />Finally someone loaned the CD to me and I became obsessed with it. I don't go through one day without listening to almost every song. I love the music, the lyrics... everything.<br />My top fave on the CD is &quot;Points of Authority&quot;... all the rest I love equally. I totally recommend this CD to everyone!!
0553208845|4.0|As a substitute teacher for a class of sophomores, I needed to spend an evening reading the classic, Siddhartha.  Although I had read it years ago in my own tenth grade English class, I found it much more meaningful as an adult.  Siddhartha's journey is actually one of any life, anyone who, in his/her life comes to grips with the fact that wisdom cannot be taught.  That one's inner peace is brought about from within, not from outside.  Siddhartha leaves his father's house (where he has been a beloved son) and takes off with his dear friend, Govinda, to live with the Samanas - in search of the great Gotama (the Buddha).  This is only the first step in his life's journey to acquire wisdom (or `truth').  Along the way he experiences material wealth, carnal love, great impoverishment, and great self-denial (suffering), and even has a child by a lover.  None of these events satisfies his yearning however.  At the brink of suicide, he settles with a poor old man who ferries people across a river, Vasudeva.  It is there that he comes to terms with what wisdom and truth are all about.  He listens to the river and to the occasional utterings of Vasudeva (who has seen a great much in this world).  It is a truly universal story and one that persons of all ages and religions and backgrounds should read and appreciate for it's clarity about self-discovery.

B000002GI0|4.0|Slow turning generally gets less critical acclaim than Bring the Family.In my own opinion though, this is a far superior record: the bounce, enthusiasm and joy of the songs being driven along by a band that sounds as though it's having the time of its life and sung by a man who seems to have seen an extremely bright light at the end of a very dark tunnel put into the shade the more antiseptic sound of the previous record. Of his subsequent albums only Walk On consistently matches the high quality of this one.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix... you all have at least heard of the movie, and you all know that it is known for the special effects... and the special effects are AWESOME!!!! But this movie has depth... I originally watched this film in theatres, and I was blown away by the special effects, but that was about it... the story was cool, but nothing spectacular... anyways, I watched it again tonight (well half of it anyways), and my God, this movie is totally awesome... it's more then awesome special effects, it's an awesome movie all around, one of the best sci-fi movies ever, no question... The story is very ingenious, and philosophical... I wonder how many people have actually wondered if this world was nothing more then a computer program fed to our brains, I know I have... and before the movie came out I might add... I won't get into the details of the story, cause you'll just have to see it... but the way the effects, music, and everything about the movie comes together is awesome... it all fits together perfectly... the action scenes are obviously designed to appeal to those you might not totally grasp the concept and message of the story line, but if you can appreciate the plot with the effects and action scenes, and everything else that is here, it'll just blow your mind... I turned off the tv (the movie was shown on television) and was totally blown away tonight... this is an inteligent movie, and is more then a bunch of innovative effects... if you liked the movie for the effects, and didn't really go too deep in the plot, well watch it again, and take in everything... it's an awesome movie, and one of the best ever in my opinion... oh, and another thing, I've never really been a fan of Keanu Reeves acting, but even he turns in a good performance (the others are stellar as well)... definately check this out... deserves more then 5 stars...<br />oh, and another thing, it's totally based around computers and that stuff, so you definately need to have some knowledge or interestin that stuff to really enjoy this movie... but still, you need to see this movie!!!! well, I've said too much... later...
B000002B35|5.0|I agree! I agree that this is one of the best live albums recorded! Counted times have I preferred live versions from original ones... but these guys, listen to me, they've got the gift! Or someone in there has, becuase these arrangements, the versions! They're beautiful, modern, increidbly well played, I'd give it more stars if I could (and I never say that) It's increidble that I've had these cd sinceit came out (Was it '94?) and I still hear it. Constantly. Once a week at least (and even if I have new cd's in there) as someone once wrote in one of these reviews: it's one of my top cd's. It's moody and it's updated! It's long and uses all the space in both cd's to cram up a huge live record. Well mixed, well sang, well played. THe slapping in Another brick on the wall (pt.2) gives it the funky feeling it always neede... that bassist is (I think) young and he rocks, those bass lines, going against and with the music, inventiveness, progresiveness all over... Virtous playing! It's good that they ditched Waters. Or that he walked. They were going old, the last cd with him wasn't going on so powerfully (The Final Cut)and without Wright they just didn't make it. Now they do!!! Mason's drumming is as cool as it can be, those rototoms are up in the top, as well as Wright's keyboards, they sound as updated and nice as always, all the atmosphere in there and Gilmour's singing more than supplies for Waters (except perhaps for Comfortably Numb, that duet was VERY good originally... but in this case the guitar solo makes up for it) the feeling is a tearjerker, more than ever. Perhaps for purists Dark side of the moon is not as good, and perhaps it really isn't, but I like the versions anyway, they are great! But the highlight is the 1st cd, especially Shine On You Crazy Diamond and song 9 (I cannot remember the name right now)... those guitar and keyboard effects rule. and the bass rocks. Buy buy buy. If you like Pink FLoyd. If you like Space Rock. If you like Prog rock. If you like weed. If you like virtous playing. If you like cool sounds. If you like Feeling. If you like cool catchy pop songs. If you like good rock, good music. Trust me, you'll like it.
0061040967|5.0|This is a book for all Discworld fans, and apart from the Witches all the usual characters can be found here.<br />Cohen the Barbarian is bored, and so with the Silver Horde in tow, decides that it is time to go on one last quest - to return to the Gods what the 1st hero took, but in a bigger and louder form.  Unfortunately, this will end with the destruction of the Discworld.<br />So a team is put together to stop this happening, which includes Carrot and everyones fave Wiz(z)ard, Rincewind.  It all gets very silly from here on in, when they take off in a new flying machine (the Kite) designed by Leonard da Quirm.  Then we get into the realm of parody (of the moon landings), unexpected stowaways and crash landings.<br />Getting away from the story - so I don't spoil it for you - the pictures that accompany Terry's story are also fabulous.  My particular favourite would have to be Paul Kidby's illustration of Death holding a kitten.  Any chance of a poster?  I hope so.<br />I would recommend this book to all Pratchett fans, and anyone else into comic fantasy.  It only took me an afternoon to read, so it must be good.<br />BUY THIS BOOK, as Death would say.<br />P.S.  Incase you can't guess - the Discworld isn't destroyed - so more books to come, phew.
B00005NP05|4.0|Country music has several differences from other genres.  Country music often includes fiddles or banjos.  You can usually make out the words to a Country song.  Some Country acts wear cowboy hats.  Some themes, like love gone bad, are more prevalent in Country music than in Rock.<br />Martina McBride, like Faith Hill, lurks in a corner of Country music that is not far from Pop.  Martina doesn't wear a cowboy hat.  You'll hear a little fiddle but no banjo.  Martina sings not only about love but also about social issues of poverty and domestic abuse.  The lyrics in Martina's songs come through loud and clear.<br />If you are not a big Country fan, the most familiar tune on the album may be I Love You from the movie Runaway Bride.  Her most enduring hit, Independence Day, is also to be found in this Greatest Hits collection.  Martina's first single, The Time Has Come, is notably absent.<br />The four new songs on the album are excellent.  When God-Fearin' Women Get the Blues is already out as a single.  This album also includes an excellent introduction to the song you may not have heard.  This song has the sort of sassy spunk that recalls the Dixie Chicks.  The other three new songs on the CD are also good enough to be released as singles.<br />If you are a Martina McBride fan, the new songs make the album worth buying.  If you've been listening to Country radio over the last few years, this album has many songs that you will definitely recognize and this album does have all of her major hits.  Among these are Wild Angels, Life #9, and Whatever You Say.  If you enjoy female vocalists but are not much into Country, you should also consider buying this album.  Martina is not Country enough to discourage Pop listeners.<br />I thought about giving this album 5 stars but decided on 4.  Although I've bought all of Martina's albums, she has recorded few of my alltime favorite songs.  This album is filled with excellent songs but few are truly outstanding.  Although Martina has a strong, beautiful voice, her voice is not as distinctive as that of Reba McEntire or the Dixie Chicks' Natalie.<br />I predict that most people will enjoy this album but few will rate it as one of their top ten favorites.a has a strong, beautiful voice, her voice is not as distinctive as that of Reba McEntire or the Dixie Chicks' Natalie.<br />I predict that most people will enjoy this album but few will rate it as one of their top ten favorites.
0966638328|5.0|I teach digital media and design to grade eleven and twelve students. This is the only book on Color that my students responded to with enthusiasm. The book covers color theory very basically. However, it does an excellent job of covering the more important topics of the meaning and psychology of colors and color combinations. The author uses good examples for each section and the book can be used as a learning tool or a resource you can use again and again. My students found the many pantone color combination swatches very useful in helping setup the color schemes for their designs. My students and I recommend this book highly, You might say this review is 5 stars taken 80 times.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; is kool already, but the special edition is even better. It still has the 9 hitz that it always had, but it also has new stuff. Check this out:<br />HIStory Begins<BR>1) WANNA BE STARTIN' SOMETHIN' - I ain't got no idea what this song's about, but it gots a good, beat, and it is a good jumpy, pop, song.<BR>2) BABY BE MINE - A good happy song disco/funk type song.<BR>3) THE GIRL IS MINE (f/ Paul McCartney) - If you like Paul McCartney songs, you will like this one. It is kind of a medium-tempo, pop song.<BR>4) THRLLER - Y'all heard his song, so what can I say.<BR>5) BEAT IT - Ya heard this to. It sounds kind of like &quot;My Sharona&quot; (as Quincy Jones says)<BR>6) BILLIE JEAN - An awesome pop song with attitude &amp; one of MJ's biggest hitz.<BR>7) HUMAN NATURE - A good smooth relaxing type song, that has a sample in SWV's &quot;Right Here&quot;<BR>8) P.Y.T. (PRETTY YOUNG THING) - Really funky song. It will get you movin'.<BR>9) THE LADY OF MY LIFE - A very smooth ballad , that has a sample in LL Cool J &amp; Boys II Men's &quot;Hey Lover&quot;.<br />HIStory Continues: The Bonus Material.<BR>SOMEONE IN THE DARK (From &quot;THE E.T. STORYBOOK&quot;) - A good slow kids song with E.T.'s voice at the end.<BR>BILLIE JEAN (1981 Demo) - This is so funny. MJ just mumbles the words, b/c they haven't been written yet. THe music sounds pretty good.<BR>THRILLER (Voice over session) - You get to hear an added Vincent Price verse never heard before. It's pretty kool.<BR>CARASOUL - Only 1 min &amp; 49 secs, but it is a good medium speed pop love song.<br />This CD is awesome, and If u r a hardcore MJ fan, you should get this!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|The sound quality of the original CD release of &quot;Thriller&quot; was already pretty great (I remember it being used as a demo disc when I bought my first CD player in 1985), but it's been goosed and buffed up here a bit - mostly in the removal of background hiss, etc. The contents of the original album are well known enough to go without comment. The additions are not much of an attraction, however : 2 previously unreleased session songs and one home demo (&quot;Billie Jean&quot;) that are interesting but don't shake the rafters. The rest are interviews (try listening to those twice) and the &quot;missing&quot; second verse of the &quot;Thriller&quot; rap by Vincent Price. Booklet does have some nice new notes, but if you have the original &quot;Thriller&quot; CD there really isn't much here to make this an essential purchase, just a luxury.
B000000OSG|4.0|I'm not going to say this is GNR's best album, because i only have two others- Appetite for Destruction and Spaghetti Incident. I prefer Use Your Illusion 2 compared to these.<br /> This album has many 'quite moving' soft rock songs and a sprinkle of GNR's unique hard rock/ soft metal. The latter is evident in songs like 'Get In the Ring'.<br /> The collection of soft rock songs are the best i've heard in one single album. Songs like 'Civil War', '14 Years' and 'Knockin' on Heavens Door' will be familiar to people who have never even heard of GNR, (thats how famous they are). The best song on this album is undoubtly 'Don't Cry' and Its a shame that you can't hear the sample on Amazon.<br /> I got this album in 93', and i'm still discovering new sounds (thanx to Slash). I recommend this to new fans but i don't know how representative this album is of there whole portfolio.
B00005QGAT|5.0|A more consistant album than &quot;Thriller&quot; (honestly), and equally groundbreaking in its own way. This new edition has been sonically buffed-up to some extent, and a few bonus tracks added on. The bonus tracks - 2 demos (OK) and an interview (snooze) - don't add up to too much. Nice booklet with new notes. Essential if you don't already have the first version on CD, a nice luxury if you do.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Imagine The Beatles getting back together - during the disco era. That's kind of like what goes on with Lucas' creation. First, if you're going to believe the events took place before the others, you don't use 2-dimensional (and extremely &quot;computerized&quot;) computer-generated characters, spaceships, etc. You use physical, tangible, 3-dimensional models and do not surpass the effects - which are STILL spectacular - of the first three. Nothing new here. Same types of characters, same action sequences, and an extremely overdone score by John Williams. What it boils down to is that everybody has a prime. George Lucas has waited too long to try and hold on to and re-create his glory days. BOO! to The Phantom Menace. Just pretend it was never released and enjoy the original trilogy in its original prints. There's nothing new here.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of puppets is a great heavy album.  The opening song, Battery is fast paced and a good energizing song.  The title song, Master of Puppets is one of the best but it leaves room for improvement (fortunatly they fixed it on S&M).  This album is not as melodic as some of their newer stuff but it's true heavy metal, unlike Papa Roach or some of the other ... nu-metal bands that have unfortunatly made it big today.
B000002H38|5.0|Hey, what can a sister like me say, except go get this album if you haven't already. This album is a true collectors album.... No Doubt. It is so relaxing and romantic, you can just chill and clear your mind while this is playing, it's unlike any other cd I have listened to. Anita Baker is a beautiful artist to say the least and she hasn't waived her style to blend in with the other artists. She is just ANITA BAKER THE SONGTRESS that will make you love Jazz, especially if your strickly down for another style of music. The cd is rather short but it is Oh So Sweet. The songs that I enjoyed the most is No one in the World, Sweet Love, Been so Long and Cauight in the Rapture. These songs were beautifully done and are a smooth way to let someone know how much they mean to you. I hope Anita produces another c.d. We need you Anita!!!!!!!!!!. one love.

B00000I07P|5.0|'Slippery When Wet' is easily Bon Jovi's best album in my opinion, I would even go a so far to say that no other Bon Jovi album comes close. It must rate as one of the best rock albums of the eighties along side such albums as 'Hysteria' by Def Leppard, 'Seventh Son of a Seventh son' by Iron Maiden and 'Appetite for Destruction' by Guns n' Roses. If you are into eighties rock or rock music in general then this album is an absolute must have. From the opening track 'Let it Rock' through to the last 'Wild in the Streets' this is rock music at its very best. This album was made before Bon Jovi became house hold names, in fact it was singles taken from this album('Livin' on a Prayer', 'You Give Love a Bad Name' and the brilliant 'Wanted Dead or Alive') that took them from support act to major headliners and rock superstardom. Although Bon Jovi have since made lyrically better albums this remains their best musically. I think after 'Slippery..' Bon Jovi sold their sole to a more comercial, more radio freindly sound and lost the rocky edge they had to their music which many fans enjoyed. Nevertheless Bon Jovi still remain one of the most successful rock bands of all time and 'Slippery When Wet' is where it all began. Buy if you haven't already.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Killer Klowns from Outer Space is absolutely hillarious, and it gives weirdos like me the chance to bond with other weirdos about this weird film.<br />The film starts with a circus tent falling out of the sky and landing out in the forest. A race of bloodsucking aliens- which happen to look like circus clowns- proceed to attempt to take over the world. Sounds corny? It's supposed to be. You must remember that, at no point, does Killer Klowns from Outer Space take itself fully seriously.<br />During the course of the film, the Klowns turn people into cotton candy (or a cotton candy-like substance, so the film says) and load them into the spaceship for storage. Sometimes, the Klowns knock off people just for the fun of it.<br />Also, the music in Killer Klowns is spectacular. I recall replaying scenes five or six just because I liked the musical stings in them. The film's theme song is a hoot too.<br />The Killer Klowns experience is one in a million. If you're looking for a unique and original film, look no further.
0345413377|1.0|A sickly treacly addition to the political emetic that is modern fantasy. As subtle as the neon in Piccadilly circus. As gross as Ursula K Leguin's feminist tracks in never never land. However Pullman does compliment the drab landscape of progressive England &quot;like communist Romania with fast food joints&quot; as one one of Murdochs tabloids chirruped.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Its difficult to appreciate today the atmosphere of anticipation that surrounded the release of the first of the Star Trek films. Star Trek fans were not always numerous but die very hard. Year after year the show accumulated a passionate following that after ten years in syndication the numbers were there to justify making Star Trek into a motion picture.  Regardless of any story shortcomings it was tough to quell the excitement of finally seeing the of Kirk, Spock,McCoy and the rest of the crew splashed across a thirty foot silver screen in &quot;70mm with Dolby Sound&quot;...still brand new to theater goers in that day. <BR>   The spectacular opening showcased the first Klingons to sport the now familiar ribbed foreheads and spoke in a fully developed Klingon dialog developed especially for the film. Their fated encounter with a vast spatial phenomena is the first of a chain of events that draws a shiny new Enterprise prototype out of dry-dock into an emergency mission. Exploiting the emergency, Captain Kirk, now decommissioned, calls on favors from Star Fleet higher-ups making an unseemly power grab that unseats a more deserving and technically more savvy younger Captain.  Already making himself unpopular, Kirk proceeds to exacerbate the situation by replacing the untested Enterprise crew with his former shipmates. No longer familiar with current tech, they also resent Kirk's hubris but reluctantly sign on to do battle with the mysterious entity that threatens the solar system.<BR>   The unpleasant politics of Kirk's return to Command throws a wet blanket on what many fans expected would be a more joyful reunion. The 2hr 16 minute  film also makes some pacing miscalculations in the first hour.  It was entirely understandable that after a ten year wait the director would want to make the first view of the new Enterprise a grand experience but the shuttle tour of the exterior drags on more than a little too long. Unfortunately the new Enterprise could not compareto the grandeur of the spectacular ships recently seen in Star Wars or even the magnificent Klingon destroyer witnessed at the opening. The same pacing problem occurs later lingering over the costly effects work that created the spectacular vastness of the alien entity.  Meanwhile Still on the planet Vulcan,  Spock interrupts an important  ritual of mental discipline to intercept the Enterprise crew. Strangely Spock will remain silent his first ten minutes on the ship as they proceed to the phenomena continuing the soggy blanket reunion theme.  However after the ice is broken and the Enterprise enters the vast entity, the  film finally breaks stride and returns the  more familiar adventure and relationship elements that made the Star Trek such a phenomena.  The remainder of the film unravels smoothly and liberally borrows favorite plot lines from previous Trek TV episodes and fuses them with some true-life NASA lore. <BR>  The financial success of this first effort laid the foundation for a succession of future films the best of which was to follow in Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan. This will always be fondly remembered as the film that started it all...including the well known maxim that the best Star Trek films are the even numbered ones. <BR>   It is probably worth mentioning in passing that foreign model/actress Persis Khambatta was rumored to have been paid one million to shave her head bald for the film. (Not bad for an unknown commodity) Also watch very carefully when  Spock is exploring inside of  V'ger right after he delivers the line \\"What or who are we dealing with?\\" you will briefly see Darth Vader and Miss Piggy!  Also Trek trivia buffs might be interested to know Captain Will Decker is supposed to be the son of Commodore Matt Decker who died saving the Enterprise from the fish-shaped \\"Doomsday machine\\" on the TV series.
B00003CXAA|1.0|Suffice it to say that the quality of I and II are TERRIBLE. They are grainy, have blips, and the lighting is overly dark. Others reviewers here have said the same, so this is not just my overimagination. I love the films as much as anyone, but cannot DE-recommend this collection enough.<br />Coppola obviously put absolutely NO effort into cleaning up the old prints. Seeing that he has not done anything really worthy since 1979 (Apocolypse Now), I take this release as a way for Coppola and Paramount to maximize their return at the expense of quality, and our pocketbooks.<br />Please, don't make the mistake I did. Don't waste your money.
0070511136|4.0|Personally, I thought this book could have been condensed down quite a bit (I found the graphics to be nearly useless).  However, it did help me to recognize, consolidate, and understand much of what I have picked up on my own over the last few years.  <br />In addition, I found myself in agreement with most of what the author had to say which helped to build my confidence level.  The book contains many useful examples which highlight the author's methods.  The most interesting portions of the book are the author's disproval of the effectiveness of some well-known sales techniques when used in large accounts.  Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who makes his living in sales.  You are almost certainly going to pick up something useful.<br />I also agree with the reviewer below with regard to the title of this book. Perhaps the author should venture into marketing as his next area of research.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album, never gets old.  With time, I think it gets better.  If you like Pearl Jam you MUST have this in your collection if you don't already.  If you aren't sure if you like Pearl Jam at all you MUST have this in your collection.  It is great, much like their other albums.
0790720434|5.0|A great film. Its very entertaining and a joy. Mary was born in India and her parents never thought about her. They always cared for themselves. Her parents soon passed away because of a fire so she was sent to her aunts house. It was different at the mansion that her aunt had. It was strange to her. One night Mary heard a boy crying and she followed the sound. The boy always talked about that he was going to die soon just like his father. He couldn't walk and was always in bed. They became friends but then Mary met Dicken and that kind of split up the relationship of Mary and the one boy that she met before. Mary found a secret garden and told Dicken about it. They started growing plants and flowers in the garden. After a while the flowers and plants started blooming and it was the most beautiful garden you would have ever seen. They decided to take the boy to the garden and they tought him how to walk. In the garden there would be animals running around. The three of them would always hang out in the garden. Mary says if you look in a cirtain way, the whole world is as if it were a garden.

Ask the first overpaid Screenwriter, a brand like David Mamet would be fine, to adapt the ridiculous novel, this is guaranteed to be a failure so you should discard the first overpaid screenwriter but keep some of his ideas as it will provide extra seasoning to the second overpaid and award winning screenwriter. Choose the brand that was used for \\"Schindler's List\\" I think that brand of screenwriter is sometimes called Steven Zaillian.<br />2. When the adaption is complete, you, the chef must find a tyrannical yet famous director (he acts a bit like hamburger helper to your overcooked script) to craft your overpaid screenwriter's work.

0380973650|3.0|Gaiman is an excellent storyteller, but a curiously afflicted writer. He seems to have a single dominant thread that runs through his work, and perhaps I'm only frustrated with it because I'm not from the UK. That thread is this: his protagonist always seems to get shoved, manipulated or dragged around in the story without ever exhibiting much control. Like in this book: eventually it becomes clear that Shadow is the hero because of his remarkable capabilities, but emotionally and mentally, he remains passive, directionless and often -- whether literally or figuratively -- completely in the dark.<br />I like Gaiman's work, and I understand how writers write themselves &quot;into&quot; their work, but I can't imagine that someone as successful and well-regarded as Neil Gaiman is as big a zero as most of his main characters seem to be.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Did the Greeks have an amphetamine goddess? If they did she surely was inspiring Patti Smith when she created this record. On &quot;Gloria&quot; alone there are at least 5 discernable vocal styles, all of which were used with great success by any number of female rockers that followed. Rather than merely swoon, little Patti obviously took notes from the Stones, Dylan, and Hendrix. Blow up Lilith Fair and send Sarah McClachen, Jewel, and the Indigo Girls a copy of this record. Testosterone is not anthrax, which is not to say that this record does not contain dazzling subtlies and soft melodies. It's hard to believe there are people out there walking around who haven't heard this record.

B00005RDAF|5.0|Woah...looks like it's gonna be good......how do I know this? Well, besides memorizing the &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; lyrics and dance moves, I've seen the behind the scenes making and got it on tape! I'm pretty sure this is going to be included on here and it has some pretty good information, etc. It's pretty interesting watching the making and knowing how they got the sexiest and steamiest (literally) video out there. They are all in an Asian club (That's what I read, I don't know if it's Asian, but it's a club) and Britney is outside on the balcony. She starts singing and going into the dance room. At the first chorus, the incredible choregraphy begins. She does some of the best dancing yet in her videos. The only ones I think are superior to it is &quot;Stronger&quot; and &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy:The Stop Remix&quot; It's a very nice video! The CD will also include the &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; video, which will be set in the outdoors, at least partially. That's really all I know about that one. Go to GoHastings.com and check the music section for a clip of that. I've also heard &quot;Let Me Be&quot; from the On The Line Soundtrack and it will also be on the album. I'm hoping she will sing this live here. She co-wrote a lot of the songs tha will be featured on the album. It will have a preview for her movie also...Crossroads...can't wait for that. Britney has definetely eveolved into a womanly performer. (Sings, dances, acts, and even writes!) Can't wait at all for this video!

B00003CWN3|3.0|After seeing the movie the first time, I asked my husband to watch it with me. I had mixed emotions about the film the first time and have watched it several times since.  It is an electrifying movie &amp; leaves the viewer with a sense of \\"something's wrong here.\\"<br />I purchased the book and realize that the movie is very loosely based on Teena Brandon's selfishly pursued identity crisis.  The first half of the book deals with Teena's background and points to her aberrant behavior at an early age; beginning with her use of people.  She stole from her mother and lied to her and her sister.  By the time she completed the transfer from girlhood to boyhood and completely took on the male identity, she was deceiving all her \\"female\\" relationships. <br />She used each of her female relationships as a stepping-stone to other relationships.  The \\"girlfriends\\" seemed emotionally brainwashed such that when confronted with the truth of Teena's true identity, they refused to believe it.  Her mother followed her along and tried to clean up her messes.  When she got into serious trouble with the law, she skipped and left her mother or her prior relationships to deal with the crisis.  The movie does not reflect these attributes of \\"Brandon,\\" it leads us to believe that she was a misunderstood individual struggling with her identity while trying to fit into society.  Whereas, in reality, she caused all the problems that seemed to plague her which lead to her own downfall.<br />Her transgender and sexual identity aside, she came across as a self-absorbed narcissist who shunned real help when offered and strung people along for her own benefit without regard to the outcome. One real incidence in the movie reflects this: she never allowed Lana to observe her sexuality, while she herself was promulgating her own manhood.  By the time her \\"girlfriends\\" found out her true sexual identity they were so emotionally attached that they were often confused and bewildered.  Hence being in the wake of Brandon's affairs left them in a quandary as to their own sexuality.  Returning to normal life seemed hard for them.<br />I do not judge people who are consenting adults, but in this case most of her \\"girlfriends\\" were minors and all were not allowed to \\"choose\\" to be in a lesbian relationship.  They were not given that choice - this choice was forced upon then by deceptive means.  I do not believe that she should have been murdered, but do understand the feelings of rage that accompanied the murders.  I do not see this as a \\"HATE CRIME\\" in the fact that she was not murdered for her sexual choice, it was that she deliberately concealed that choice.  And, it is not a homophobic case, because, as everyone states, Teena Brandon (in her own admission) was not a homosexual, just a gender choice.<br />The movie is found lacking in the setup for the murder: the real Teena Brandon.  However, it does allude to the fact that she forged checks in one instance, but does not go into details that she was a wanted felon for abuse of ATM cards, grand theft auto, etc.<br />All in all, the movie seemed bias to the fact that she was murdered for who she was instead of what she had done to arrive in that situation.  In my view, I wonder what would've been the outcome of Teena Brandon if she'd been truthful and forthright in her relationships and faced up to her lawlessness instead of running away each time she faced a dilemma.  Instead she brought havoc &amp; destruction everywhere and to everyone she came in contact with.   In my opinion, Teena Brandon lacked respect - first of all for herself, for property, for the laws, and most importantly, for other human beings.  Not only is Brandon Teena, the character in the book and movie a sad character, but also the person Teena Brandon, as in her own words, \\"I don't see where I did anything wrong.\\"  And, \\"Brandon did not identify as a lesbian, saying [s]he was disgusted by the idea of loving a woman that way.\\"<br />If you liked the movie but are left with questions, I suggest you read the books.  So much was left out of the movie that is seems surreal - like a true Hollywood make-believe movie.  Do not take this \\"based on a true story\\" movie for face value - a lot of important information was left completely out of the film.<br />But overall, it was a good movie for the sake of watching a movie.
0783246641|4.0|I say grey because the movie is too goofy in so many parts to call it dark.  If you like to laugh at stuff that the average whiner refers to as horrible, this movie is great.  The acting is great on all parts.  &quot;Bateman&quot; will really convince you he is nuts, and all of the other characters do a great job of playing [exagerated]corny yuppies that take themselves seriously.  It's as if the director knew it was a joke but the actors didn't.<br />For all of the humor and rediculous eighties characteristics, it gets a little creepy at the end if you pay attention.  There are a few different angles to psychotic behavior you could gather, all of them at odds with popular attitudes.  If you don't get into all that, it's still a fun movie.
B000053V7Q|4.0|This great new version of the 1970 concert film, `Elvis: That's The Way It Is'<BR>will hopefully help to redress the balance of critical opinion concerning the<BR>final phase of Elvis Presley's career.

Vocally, he was at his absolute peak. <BR>Fans will be delighted to see new footage and some great new camera<BR>angles (it feels like you're actually on the front row sometimes).  Gone are the<BR>irritating interviews and sideshows - this version focuses firmly on the man<BR>himself.  On the negative side, some of the songs from the original film have<BR>been sacrificed - I Just Can't Help Believin being the most glaring omission. <BR>The rehearsal section lacks the momentum of the original and the sound mix<BR>is quite poor in places.  That said, the special edition includes a great<BR>rendition of Santa Claus Is Back In Town, demonstrating Elvis' ability as a<br />blues singer.  The concert performances themselves are simply superb. <BR>Everyone will have their favourites, but for me the lesser known Elvis songs<BR>are the highlights.  I Can't Stop Loving You is fantastic.  Just Pretend really<BR>shows off Elvis' vocal range.  Patch It Up is a real rocker.  This is Elvis at his<BR>best.  Sit back - and enjoy!
B00005CCA9|5.0|The first Rach 3 I ever heard was the Gutierrez, an awesome recording and a *perfect* performance. Gutierrez plays the third with a consistent Romantic accuracy, and compared to Gutierrez, Argerich is overloading with passion. Her technical capacity (or audacity) allows her to reach dangerous places with Rachmaninoff. Her playing is so dynamic: her slows are slower and her fasts are faster.  At times I wonder how the playing she does is physically possible; at other times her extreme playing speed obliterates the delicate Rachmaninoff andante that is meant to be savored.  The same goes for the included two-piano suites.  This CD sacrifices a clean performance and recording for live presence and excitement.  If you like that tradeoff, then go for it.
0375704027|5.0|A love story is a perfect device for the exposition of both the mood and the analysis of the psychological state that is created by the mood.  The mood is lornful longing.  The psychological state is death and transfiguration.  All of this beautifully told through the vehicle of a Japanese college student's attatchment to the girlfried of his chilhood best friend, who had commited suicide after a pool game. One can't help but be drawn deeply into the huge tidal waves of the protagonist's affairs of the heart (and sometimes, flesh), beneath the surface of his listless life.Nor can one fail to be impressed with the <BR>bits of devious humor and settings of breathtakingly cool beauty that the author has used to punctuate the narrative.

0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game was the best sci- fi I read. At first, I was hesitant to reading it and wanted to just find cliff notes. .... Besides that the plot, theme, characters were great. You can really idenify with Ender (well atleast I did) how everyone expects so much from you until you can just crack!
B000000WFU|5.0|First time I listened to this music, I was shocked at the mysterious ensemble. I wanted to get other Jenkins' CDs and<BR>bought some of them. Most of his CDs were outstanding in terms of creativity. &quot;Songs of sanctuary&quot; was really the best among them. I'll keep enjoying this beautiful masterpiece.
6301969294|2.0|I read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged about a year after I had started college.  I can definitely say that that book changed my life.<br />I could see the logistical problems with making Atlas Shrugged into a movie.  The book is just so unbelievably complex - you could read it a dozen times and get something new out of it each time.  It would seem impossible to fit everything into a single movie.<br />This film does a horrible job in the attempt.  It jumps from scene to scene without any explanation really.  The only reason that I had some clue as to what was going on was because I had read the book.  I don't understand how all the other reviewers could have missed this.  I wanted to love this movie, but it was impossible.
B00000K44W|5.0|of all the huge body of work that JETHRO TULL have released HEAVY HORSES must rank as perhaps their finest moment.The whole album reeks of the british countryside and its lost values and traditions.Highlights here are the stirring and moving title track,ONE BROWN MOUSE and ROVER.Exceptional.
B00003CXC7|5.0|The ultimate Hitchcock classic, REAR WINDOW gives us a glimpse into the mind of Alfred Hitchcock, and in turn Hitchcock turns the mirror on us and forces us to admit our darkest desire...to be voyeurs.<br />That is exactly what Jeffries is.  Jeffries (James Stewart) is a wheelchair-bound photographer who spends his time cooped up in his apartment, peeping in on the neighbours across the courtyard.  He comes up with &quot;names&quot; for them; Miss Torso the ballerina; Miss Lonely-Hearts; The Newly-Weds and so on.  His only contact with the outside world is his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and his wisecracking nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter).<br />Unknowlingly witnessing the murder of Mrs Thorwald, he, along with Lisa and Stella, set out to expose the truth about Mr Thorwald (Raymond Burr) and uncover the mystery of her quick disapperance.<br />A beautifully-restored print by James Katz and Robert Harris (also responsible for the beautiful new renderings of MY FAIR LADY and VERTIGO), is the highlight of this DVD.  The original negative was severely faded and turning green when Universal aqquired the entire Paramount film library.  Color-correction and shadow detail are now back to their original state, as is the soundtrack featuring Franz Waxman's sparkling score.<br />The ULTIMATE Hitchcock thriller, with more than a touch of romance and comedy.
B00004R99L|4.0|Disney does its own take on the Lewis Carroll classic in this 1951 animated feature film!  While the voices by Kathryn Beaumont, Ed Wynn, Sterling Holloway and others are excellent, this film is not exactly true to the spirit of the book!  But since this is Disney it is to be expected and with a song like &quot;I'm Late, I'm Late, for a Very Important Date&quot; you certainly feel like making allowances!  But certainly Disney's strength is with more traditional fairy tale fare!
6301969294|2.0|I just realized that I kept typing &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; where I meant to type &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;.<br />All the comments I made pertain to this movie.  I don't know why I mixed up the names like that.
0393317552|5.0|On a recent train trip I picked up this book (which had been recommended by a dear friend) at the station book store and didn't put it down 'til I reached my destination.  My wife got hold of it when I returned home and hasn't put it down yet.  <BR> <BR>The author -- an ornithologist by training -- spent decades in New Guinea in quest of exotic species.  While there, he became friendly with the &quot;natives,&quot; who refer to the accoutrements of western civilization as &quot;cargo.&quot;  One of these New Guinea friends asked him, &quot;Why do you white people have so much cargo and we black people have so little?&quot;  <br />Diamond took the question seriously.  He discards the racist answers we learned in school:  that people from cold climates are more hard-working than people from warm climates.  Instead, he develops his answer from evidence based on geology, archaeology, zoology and botany.  <BR> <BR>If you think this sounds boring, think again.  Diamond's explanations of why Europeans infected native peoples with diseases but NOT vice versa (in this era of anthrax scares) has put more than Osama bin Laden into perspective for us.  <BR> <BR>Yes, the book is long; 457 pages, in fact.  The point is, it's worth it.  Both of us, having read it, want to read it again, to pick up the nuances we missed the first time around.  <BR> <BR>We not only recommend it, we urge you to read it.  This is an important book.  It will change every perception you ever had about the spread of &quot;civilization&quot; and the White Man's Burden (sorry, Rudyard Kipling).
B00004Z459|5.0|I think this is a great CD. It really has a good beat to it and it's not too trashy like some CD's. It certainly earns 5 stars!
B000059Z8J|4.0|Before you watch this movie, tell yourself these three things;<BR> 1.  Its a comic and some escapacism is allowed due to the fact that the movie perfectly captures and places us in real time to make us feel Superman exists.  I don't think any action adventure comic movie will get any closer than that.<BR> 2.  I was a kid when it came out, and was too fascinated to notice any, even the most obvious, fumbly tricks of the trade.<BR> 3.  This was a movie made before computers. It has a more of a depth feeling to the movie as if everything has mass, emotion, movement and inertia instead of a flat, click and drag feel to it. <BR>     Not yet, maybe many more years from now, I think this movie will be looked at as a masterpiece because it was created by people who used their skill and dug out their creative ideas which is now done with the help of computers.  The movie was set in 1978 and the quality made it revolutionary to this day.  <BR>     I originally wanted to set it at 3.5 stars. Flying against the city drop backs didn't match--this may have been from the better digital quality of the DVD which made the differences more obvious. Also because fast reaction scenes where the cameras were speeded up were more obvious, and towards the end the movie seemed to jumped through plots, but in the special features this reason is explained.  Which is why I rated it four stars--I'll just say the special features is pretty cool.
B00003CXAA|5.0|&quot;I believe in America...&quot; the opening line of a film that made motion picture history with it's portrayal of family, love, honour, loyalty and vengeance. If anybody ever had a doubt about how good a director Francis Ford Coppola is, then this package will prove how good he is. The first movie made stars out of Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall and showed the world that if Marlon Brando had never appeared in On the Waterfront, The Wild One or A Streetcar Named Desire, the The Godfather was HIS role. This DVD package is nothing short of superb, five discs, Part I,II(2 discs), Part III &amp; a fifth disc full of all the extras you would want to see. The commentaries from FFC in all 3 movies is informative and interesting. In Part I the horse's head sequence and the murder of Solozzo/McClusky still shocks.<BR>STOP READING, BUY, WATCH and DIGEST the GREATEST movie of all time.
B000053VAF|5.0|This is a very interesting and different movie, the emphasis in \\"different\\".  If you take offense at \\"religious jokes\\", then you should not see it.  For those of you that are a bit more opened minded this is a movie that will make you think about some points of the modern religious \\"dogmas\\" and some of the known mythologies.
B000002OZY|4.0|I love this album. Play it all the time, and I do mean ALL the time. The way the album is woven is spectacular. But, I must that I have one and only one reason to say that this is a 4 star album. I got Live at Leeds first. After hearing the Live version of many of the Tommy songs, the studio made songs seemed a little less....The Who, really. But still, this album is spectacular. When it debut in 1969 it introduced us to the all new grown up, Who. Before Tommy, The Who where a bunch of punk mods who broke their guitars. And it was good. No, it was EXCELLANT! But then, with finacial troubles abound, the who set out to make an album that would pull them out of their hole. If Tommy didnt do well, it would most likely be The Who's last album. Lucky for us, it skyrocketed the who up there as one of the most groundbreaking bands of all time, (as if My Generation wasnt groundbreaking enough.) Unfortunatly for Pete, Roger, John and Keith, the Tommy spector haunted them where ever they went. They palyed almost nothing but Tommy for two years, people couldnt get enough of this strange new masterpeice. John once said, &quot;some people think the name of the band is Tommy and the album's called The Who!&quot; Luckly after a while, The Who managed to shake off Tommy and go on to make better work. (Example:Live at Leeds, The Uncompleted Lifehouse project which spawned the who's best album, Who's next? and Quadrophernia.) All together, Tommy is a sweeping epic album, and though in my humble opinion, the live version is far superior, Tommy still is more than worth he price.
B000059H99|4.0|For many, the title &quot;Rocky&quot; is synonymous with a bunch of muscular, sweaty, bonehead men beating each other up. I didn't expose myself to this film for a long time because of that stereotype. After my brother talked me into watching it, I discovered immediately that the stereotype was not &quot;Rocky&quot;! If anything, boxing is a subplot. This is a movie about the human spirit, personal pride, and success.<br />Rocky, who's been through hard times and will continue to go through them, represents everyone in their struggle to prove to themselves that life is worth living and that they can do anything they put their minds to. It's a great movie that keeps us cheering for Rocky Balboa as he fights his way to success and happiness with his life.

0060975768|5.0|&quot;We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young&quot; is a story of two of the first battles fought by US soldiers in Viet Nam.  Although the soldiers fought well, the military failed to appreciate that the Viet Cong also fought well, and that this was not going to be a walkover.  By concentrating on two actions, the authors examine details that would be lost in a larger survey.  One of the most chilling is the lieutenant who tells his friends that he is going to win the Medal of Honor.  Of course, what he achieves is to get himself and much of his platoon killed in short order.  This book is an accurate guide to the tactics used in the early parts of the Viet Nam war.  Finally, it shows how the Army expected the war to be won, and thus is a precursor for what would happen for years to come.  An essential book to understanding how the war was fought.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Some thought this movie is just about some little DUMB BLONDE! Boy were they wrong... I saw this movie in the theater and LOVED it. It is a must see movie.... Is a great gift for teens- 30's... Girls would love this... has a lot of GIRL-POWER and it's a great movie!!
0887306667|5.0|I recently read this book and I found it straightforward and insightful.  I have a B.S. in Acct. and an MBA in finance.  I have taken graduate level marketing courses and I have worked in evaluating corporate strategies.  This book is a must read for those that own their own business or are interested in advertising/marketing.  I believe many executives that want to move their business career forward should read the book as business processes are tied together intricately. If you want to be CEO you better learn this stuff or perish!<br />Some of the examples/predictions are definitely dated (early 90's / late 80's) and turn out to be wrong but the branding ideas stay true due to values and beliefs.  Like others I found the most interesting law to be of brand extension as I hadn't been exposed to such a thought process before (I am not in marketing) but there is a lot of merit to the thought.<br />I love it how the authors continually pound away that marketing and advertising are more of perception in the mind than actual real world truths.  The examples provided in each chapter really help the reader get the key points.
B00005N919|5.0|This is a great mystery movie. It stars Michael Zeta Jones Douglas and Sharon Stone. The mystery is...&quot;Is Sharon Stone gonna show?&quot; Watch and find out if she shows her buisquits.
B00005JJUF|5.0|I just saw the Matrix recently for the first time, and I loved it. Sure, other movies have used similar ideas. But the Matrix is still very entertaining, fun to watch, and it did make me think. <br />The opening scene is great. Action, action, and some more action, plus that awesome little spinning-camera thing with Trinity's kick. I love that part.<br />We move on to Neo, played by Keanu Reeves. Stop picking on Keanu! Sure, maybe he's a dolt, but he did a decent job in the Matrix (and he's hot!). Yet another fun spinning camera shot, this one just spiraling over Neo instead of circling around him while the action freezes like the first one. Long sentence. <br />Agent Smith is hysterically deranged. One of my favorite scenes is -- well, I won't spoil it, but it involves water. Snigger. Morpheus kicks derriere (literally); the fighting scene between him and Neo is great. <br />The film gets violenter as it goes, going from a more thoughtful sci-fi film to a nice and violent action movie. But that's not a bad thing. <br />The alleged religiousity of the Matrix is up to you: ignore it or embrace it. I ignored it -- didn't even really notice it until other people pointed it out. Some people complained about the greenish tint, but that was done intentionally to make it seem like there was something wrong with the world; the sky is never blue for the same reason because blue is \\"too happy\\". I don't know. I don't really mind the green-ness. <br />Neo's cute, Morpheus is cool, Trinity rocks, Agent Smith is my favorite character aside from spoon-boy... , and Cypher...well, I can understand his point. And Mouse cracks me up. <br />All in all, wonderful movie. Just wish I could've seen in on the big screen...<br />Best quote: \\"There is no spoon.\\"
0440539811|4.0|Particularly in these (justifiably) paranoid times, the Illuminatus! trilogy is an appropriate read. The anthrax scare and the little-known island of Fernando Poo are just on the edge of being too close to home.  I wouldn't know where to begin to explain the plot, but it's something about Eris, something about government, and something about enlightenment.<br />While reading 805 pages of conspiracy theory is certainly a fine way to immerse yourself in the world of the authors, I have to say that all three books in one volume can be just a little bit too much of a good thing.
B0000024YL|3.0|In my opinion it's a good collection but expect I don't prefer the live concert version of &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; included on here.

0425180638|2.0|Patricia Cornwell has stolen 3 days from my life of the 4 it took to wade through this book.  A LOT of wasted words and frustrating hand wringing from Kay.  I will no doubt give Cornwell one more try when this story is (hopefully) wrapped up and tossed in the furnace in her next Kay Scarpetta book.  It is a poor sequel to &quot;Black Notice&quot; and a major disappointment.
B00000JCB2|2.0|I liked this cd right when it came out. I don't care about MTV or radio play, cuz all of that just plain sucks. But uh oh, something happened along the way... like everywhere i turned i saw this annoying backwardz cap and heard this whiney lil' crybaby... and the same songs started to get played everywhere, there was no escape... the same songs over and over and over... and then the next cd that they made came out, and totally blew my mind... i never knew anything could be that pathetic n still sell billions of copies. lookz like the world is being taken over by 7th and 8th graders or something. i'm truly hoping and praying that these jokerz aren't around much longer, please America, please join together and let the next album LB putz out sit on the shelves where it belongs so they'll leave us alone once and for all. and oh yeah, cheers to wes<BR>for finally saying goodbye to the teen-pop machine, best of luck in the future to the only guy who had talent in this sad, sad excuse for a &quot;musical group&quot; (as long as he doesn't try another big dumb face, cuz that was pretty sad too).
B00003CX5P|4.0|The backlash against this heavily hyped movie and DVD is unwarranted.  Episode I was an entertaining fantastic film for the entire family.  All the naysayers are people who fail to realize that these films were born out of B-Movie Saturday Matinee Serials and are treating them (inappropriately) as high art.
0321012542|4.0|The Complete Works of Shakespeare edited by David Bevington<br />Bevington's edition of Shakespeare's plays is a popular choice, and not without good reason. But that doesn't make an ideal choice. The introduction to this one volume edition is ample with chapters on life in Shakespeare's England, the drama before Shakespeare, Shakespeare's life and work. These are good, but they tend to rely on older scholarship and they may not be current. For example Bevington repeats Hinman's claim that there were 1200 copies of the 1623 Folio printed. However later scholars think the number was quite a bit lower, around 750. It should be said that we don't know for sure how many copies of the 1623 folio were printed and either number could be correct.<br />Bevington's edition prints the plays by genre. We get a section of Comedies, Histories, Tragedies, Romances and the Poems. He puts &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; with the comedies, though we know the play was slated to appear with the tragedies in the 1623 folio. The play was never meant to appear with the comedies, and all the surviving Folios that have the play have it at the beginning of the tragedies.<br />Let's get down to brass tacks. You are not going to buy an edition of Shakespeare's works because of good introduction. You're going to buy one because the quality of the editing of the plays. Is it reliable? Is it accurate? For the most part this edition is reliable and accurate, but that does not mean it is accurate and reliable in every instance.<br />Modernized editions of Shakespeare's plays and poems are norm. Since the 18th century (and even before) editors of Shakespeare have modernized and regularized Shakespeare's plays and poems. There are good reasons for this modernization. There is the reader's ease of use and the correcting misprints and mislination. I have no problem with this regularization of spelling or punctuation. But when an editor goes beyond normalizing and modernizing--when an editor interferes with the text then I have a problem.<br /><br />Let me give two examples of the editorial interference that I am writing about:<br />King Lear 2-1-14 (p. 1184)<br />Bevington has:<br />Edmund<br />The Duke be here tonight? The better! Best!<br />This weaves itself perforce into my business.<br />The Folio has:<br />Bast. The Duke be here to night? The better best,<br />This weaues it selfe perforce into my businesse,<br />Even allowences made for modernization of punctuation and grammar would not account for Bevington's &quot;The better! Best.&quot; Bevington glosses this to mean &quot;so much the better; in fact the best that could happen.&quot; Nice try, but &quot;The better best&quot; of the folio is a double comparative, (which is a regular feature of Early Modern English) and not two separate adjectival phrases. Interestingly, the Quarto printing of Lear prints this scene in prose, and there is no punctuation between &quot;better&quot; and &quot;best&quot; in that version either.<br />A few lines down Lear 2-1-19 Edmund continues<br />Bevington has:<br />Brother, a word. Descend. Brother, I say!<br /> Enter Edgar<br />But Bevington has reversed the order. The Folio has:<br /> Enter Edgar.<br />Brother, a word, discend; Brother I say,<br />Bevington does not say why he changed the order, though to be fair other modern editors have done the same thing.<br />These two changes just a few lines apart go beyond regularization or modernization. They interfere with the text as presented in the 1623 Folio. And Bevington does not explain the changes. So next time you pick up this or any other modernized edition you should ask yourself &quot;am I really sure what I'm reading is what Shakespeare wrote?&quot;es with the text then I have a problem.<BR> <BR>Let me give two examples of the editorial interference that I am writing about:<br />King Lear 2-1-14 (p. 1184) <BR>Bevington has:<BR>Edmund<BR>The Duke be here tonight? The better! Best!<BR>This weaves itself perforce into my business.<br />The Folio has:<BR>Bast. The Duke be here to night?

B00000DQSZ|5.0|if you've ever heard an 80s club mix, you will instantly recognize the music from TEE.  upon listening to this cd, i was struck by the similarity to Radiohead's Kid A.  a few days later, i happened to read an article in which the guys from Radiohead talk about the major influence that Kraftwerk had in the making of the album.  TEE is older than i am, so this is a connection that younger people might be able to make with Kraftwerk.<BR>i've always been weary of purely electronic music, but TEE is done with an amazing musical creativity.  &quot;Metal on Metal&quot; is incredible (just close your eyes while listening to it) and &quot;hall of mirrors&quot; is another haunting personal favorite...plus, the German accent in 'hall of mirrors&quot; is kind of funny if you don't have the energy to go out and find the German version.  <BR>don't be afraid to check out this album b/c it seems &quot;primative.&quot;  you won't be disappointed.
B000059HAI|5.0|This movie is Awesome. If you want the true story of what really happened on Dec. 7, 1941, than you must see this one. It ends with the reflections of Admiral Yamamoto, foreseeing the awakening of the &quot;Dragon&quot;, and ends there. It does not go on about our &quot;response&quot; to the attack, as that other movie does. It ends where it should. A must see for all history fans and Pearl Harbor fans alike.

B00005LKHW|4.0|Ok, so I admit, this sort of juvenile humor makes me laugh. But lets<BR>get it straight: this is juvenile humor done right. It's still<BR>immature, but its timing is excellent and the casting is superb. <BR>I would strongly suggest you _don't_ watch this film with any<BR>stuck-up people around (friends, family) since you'll probably be<BR>too embarrassed to laugh at certain spots ...
0060926317|4.0|I really don't enjoy &quot;lesson&quot; books. I didn't expect this one would be an exception. It was. Mutant Messsage Down Under was the story of a woman taken on a several month walk through the Australian outback. The lessons she learns during her walk were profound, and the author pulls the reader into the lessons, through anecdotes. While listed as fiction, this book has a clear, undeniably real message to anyone who reads it. Enjoy!
1586210912|5.0|This practice blueprint for success was long awaited. Within these pages, Kiyosaki rises to the challenge of disturbing the mold of what society as a whole believes wealth building to be. Then he introduces sensible and doable strategies for obtaining the kind of success most people have longed for but just didn't have the tools needed to make it happen for themselves. Thank you for sharing your wisdom. I was homeless at 17 and I retired at 26, so I know what it means to disregard conventional thinking and just do what works.
6304806418|5.0|This star-studded motion picture is not only famous in U.S. and Europe, but is also famous around the world for it's breathtaking scenes, musical features and at most times, the way it really reflects the many ways of life and it's consequences. Starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas, it also features a short part of Andrea Corr, who played the role of Mr. Juan Peron's 16 year old mistress. As she is my idol, I really favour this movie. Also, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's musical idea was popular again the second time around after 'The Commitments', in which Alan Parker was director and Andrea Corr was the lead actress. Wholly, Madonna and Antonio Banderas acted superbly by blending into the scenes like they were really  Eva Peron and Che'. A simply fantastic movie.
B00005QGAV|5.0|This is probably my favorite MJ cd ever.  It's packed with hard hitting dance hits, SFX, heartfelt lyrics, touching melodies and beautiful harmonies.  It's a perfect capture of the MJ persona.  It also sports one of the greates album covers of all time.  Not only is it visually stunning to look at, but it can be read as a psychological exam of MJ himself!  Notice that all the flash is a mask, hiding the real MJ behind it.<br />This special edition is remastered, given a booklet with 6 new photos (one featuring Eddie Murphy and Iman from the Remember The Time video) and a cardboard keepsake case.  Dangerous was recorded with the best technology available when it was first released and this special edition doesn't sound that much better.  Actually, as special editions go, it's pretty flimsy, but seeing that the original album is packed with 77 minutes of some of the best music from the 90's you can hardly complain.  This cd is packed to the teeh already!  Yes it would be nice to have a picture disc, a photo underneath the clear cd tray, a bonus song or two, but look at what you do get.<br />JAM - A slammin dance track that says all the worlds problems aren't enough to get MJ (and hence us) down.  He can still jam!<br />Why You Wanna Trip On Me - A very personal song that still gets us to dance.  Listen to that rock lick in there!!<br />In The Closet - MJ sexiest song yet!  There is such a sexual tension running through out.<br />She Drives Me Wild - Great companion song to 'Speed Demon' from BAD.  Great use of SFX, and a kicking beat. MJ's on the prowl, watch out!<br />Remember The Time - Beautiful layerd vocals, a chorus that won't leave your head.  It's a song about a failed romance but somehow manages to be uplifting.  Always brings a smile to my face.  Showcases the power of melody and rhythm over lyrics.<br />Can't Let Her Get Away - MJ doin his funky best.<br />Heal The World - A beautifully written and sung message of hope for the world.  Listen to his range on this song.  MJ's still got it!<br />Black or White - A guitar riff to end all gutiar riffs, a positive message, and it's uplifting!  How can you go wrong?  You can't, just as long as you skip the spoken intro.<br />Who Is It - Haunting song of a broken relationship.  Again MJ piles on the vocals to tremendous effect.  He's an expert at the atmospheric, jilted lover type songs.<br />Give In To Me - MJ rocks out and give a preformance you'll not soon forget.  Listen to that ache in his voice!<br />Will You Be There - Probably the stongest song on the album.  Suprising in the fact that it's such a religious song.  It oozes emotion.<br />Keep the Faith - Truly inspirational.  It's songs like this, 'Will You Be There' and 'Man in the Mirror' that make me long fo rthe day when MJ makes a full out gospel album.<br />Gone Too Soon - A loving tribute that has MJ in top vocal form.  Simple yet very powerful.<br />Dangerous - A kickin dance song to end the set.  A therapist would have a field day with lyrics like &quot;Deep in the darkness of passions insanity, I felt taken by lusts strange inhumanity&quot;.  Hear the poety in that?  This song is an entire film set to music.  Stunning!<br />So pick up this CD not for it's special edition features, but for the music itself.  You won't be disappointed.  If you really want a special edition keep your eyes open for the rare Australian edition that featured an entire second disc of remixes or the extremely limited edition that came in a case featuring a pop up rendition of the albums cover art!on this song.  MJ's still got it!<br />Black or White - A guitar riff to end all gutiar riffs, a positive message, and it's uplifting!  How can you go wrong?  You can't, just as long as you skip the spoken intro.<br />Who Is It - Haunting song of a broken relationship.  Again MJ piles on the vocals to tremendous effect.  He's an expert at the atmospheric, jilted lover type songs.  <br />Give In To Me - MJ rocks out and give a preformance you'll not soon forget.  Listen to that ache in his voice!<br />Will You Be There - Probably the stongest song on the album.  Suprising in the fact that it's such a religious song.

B000003TA4|4.0|this is a fantastic marvelous cd.the only fault it have its that it some time sound in the same way all the time but listen to this album and realize that the world  have lost a musical &quot;geni&quot; when kurt took his life.Rest in peace kurt!
B00005QGAX|5.0|BAD is an incredible follow up to Thriller that features MJ's songwriting talents, as 9 of the 11 songs are written by him alone.  It's an incredible achievement that's filled with memorable, dancable, moving, groving songs that will stay with this listener forever.  He really came into his own with this album.  Thankfully, it's all preserved and remasered for our continued enjoyment.<br />The sound presented here is really incredible.  The pulsating bass on Bad really stands out as does the vocal layering on Leave Me Alone.  It's amazing how much better technology is, that this kind of clarity that can be achieved with a 14 year old recording.  It's also amazing how well thes songs stand the test of time.  These tracks don't seem dated at all.<br />Aside from the remastering, this special edition also features 9 new photos (plus the original 8 fish eye lens photos), interviews with Quincy Jones and 3 rare songs.  A few nit picks: the isn't a track listing for the bonus material in the booklet, the spoken intro to 'I Just Can't Stop Loving You' has been excluded for some reason, some cd cover art would've been nice (all we get is a red cd with white lettering) and I was disappointed to see there wasn't a photo underneath the clear CD tray.<br />The bonus song 'Streetwalker' was vying for the place 'Another Part of Me' took on the album.  It's an ambitious song that beautifully captures a street feel with lots of horns and bass.  It's very much dancable and running 5:49 it would've been the longest song on the album.  It's wonderful to finally be allowed to hear it but I'm glad it was cut from the album.  Not because it's bad but because Another Part of Me is so wonderful.  I'd have hated to miss out on it for all this time.<br />'Fly Away' is a mid tempo love song.  A lyrical bon-bon akin to 'I Can't Help It' from Off The Wall.  It's not mentioned in teh interview sections why this song was deleted from the album, but it surely deserved a spot, just as long as it wasn't going to replace any other song already on the ablum.<br />The spanish version of 'I Just Can't Stop Loving You' is really beautiful and it's fun to hear MJ singing in another language ( he nails those rolling the 'R').  Probably won't listen to it much, but it's nice to have anyway.<br />Ultimately, this special edition is the only edition of BAD to own.  The songs have never sounded better and you get 3 incredible bonus songs plus interviews with Quincy Jones.  Aside from all that, this is one of the greatest albums from the 80's.  How can you go wrong with a cd that features not one but FIVE number one hits?!?!  BAD is Great!wasn't going to replace any other song already on the ablum.  <br />The spanish version of 'I Just Can't Stop Loving You' is really beautiful and it's fun to hear MJ singing in another language ( he nails those rolling the 'R').

0767853636|1.0|why is this movie sooooooooooooooo Bad we will never know........
B00005QGAZ|5.0|What more can be said of this album?  EVERYONE knows the songs and it's incrdible history.  Simply put, this album is a staple like bread, milk or butter.  You can't be without a copy.  Now comes this special edition and for all the original's gretness, this one outshines it!<br />Remember the incredible remastering done on HIStory?  Well imagine that applied to the entire Thriller album.  The sound is unbelievable!  Everyhting is so crisp, full and alive!  The songs practically leap out of the speakers.  You've never heard Thriller like this before!<br />The gold colored cd clocks in at 72:32 with a total of 21 tracks (9 remastered hits), 6 new photos in the booklet, interviews, a demo and two rare songs.  Unfortunately these new tracks aren't numbered in the booklet or on the jewel case, so you'll have to memorize their order.<br />I've always liked 'Someone in the Dark' from the E.T. Storybook, but hardly ever listened to my recording as I was afraid of damaging it.  So it's great to finally have a superb recording of it that I can listen to over and over again.  It's a touching (some might say sappy) song about finding someone special then loosing them.<br />The Billie Jean demo is pretty short (only 2:20), has decent sound quality and is really insightful.  The melody and rhythm is exactly like the finished recording, yet the lyrics aren't finalised.  It's almost like the lyrics were an afterthought to the beat.  Incrdible for it's peak in to MJ's creative process.<br />'Carousel' sounds like a completed song but only runs 1:40.  It's very 70's sounding and is overflowing with refrences to sugar and children.  Sample lyric, &quot;She's from a world of popcorn and candy&quot;.  Ultimately I'm glad the song was cut, but I would've like to hear the entire song.<br />The section where Qunicy and Rod talk about how the Vincent Price sectin came to be is really entertaining.  Then we even get to hear the recording session!  Hearing Vincent Price separated from the song highlights his talent and well honed technique.  It's a joy to hear this and the extra verse is exceptionally creepy.<br />You're sure to listen to the extra songs multiple times and the interviews make for a good listen once or twice.  That plus the amazing remastering of the original album makes this a must have replacement for all die hard MJ fans and a necessary addition for anyone still not in posession of it.  It's a thriller!ng highlights his talent and well honed technique.

078322818X|5.0|This is where George Lucas' brilliant Hollywood career really got started. This is a magical film that is still fresh today as it was many years ago. The storyline is pretty much about a bunch of California teens in the summer of 1962 who are on the verge of impending adulthood. Everybody can relate to that story in some form or another. The greatest thing this film has going for it is the incredible cast : Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, Paul LeMat, Mckenzie Phillips, Candy Clark, and, of course, the hilarious Charles Martin Smith. I don't know anybody who hasn't laughed til it hurt at Charles' opening scene with the motor bike. Hilarious. This is a feel good and very nostalgic film that can be viewed over and over again. Watch out for a cameo by Suzanne Sommers too. A great teen classic.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael Jackson's first solo album as an adult tops many peoples list as his best yet.  It's an incredibly strong and innovative album that set the mold for the greatness to come.  This special edition reveals the album as it's never been heard before.<br />The clarity of sound presented here is astounding!  Especially when you go back and listen to the original release.  From the swirling cackles in the title track, to the bass on Burn This Disco Out, to the layered voices in Don't Stop, the sound enveopes you in it's crispness and rishness.  It's pure aural candy!<br />The special edition includes a booklet with 4 new photos (one featuring Paul McCartney), a brick design on the cd itself, and 18 minutes of bonus material including, interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton and, the best treat, two demo recordings.<br />Both demo's run about 4:30 and feature Randy and Janet on rhythm and sound efects.  There is a hillarious spat between Randy and Janet at the begenning of the Don't Stop demo that had me roaring in laughter.  These demos really give a sense of the Jackson family as a whole, fun, musically inventive, talented and wanting to help each other out.  They also showcase Michael's strong song writing skills.  The rhythms and arrangements are completely fleshed out but the lyrics are barely there.  What you can hear of lyrics is very different from the final recordings and seems like MJ made it up as he went along in the song (Is he really singing 'Keep on with you hot dog' in Don't Stop Til You Get Enough?).  The demo's highlight his talent as a rhythm arragner and song builder rather than a lyricist.<br />On the down side, the interviews aren't that enlightening and I can't imagine wanting to listen to them more than once or twice.  Also nowhere in the booklet or on the jewel case is the bonus material given track numbers.  There are a total of 19 tracks here with an announcer, interviews and demos.  A track listing would''ve made it alot easier to find the demo's later.  One final nitpick, I would've liked to have seen a picture underneath the cd's clear tray in the jewel case.  Instead all we get is black.  Oh well, it hardly detracts from all the great things about this sepcial edition.<br />If you're a MJ fan or have an older copy of Off The Wall, then you have to have this for the incredible restoration done, it's historical value and the insightful demo recordings.  For the rest of you, don't miss out on this strong, innovative, fun and moving album.  The sepcial edition is the one to have!find the demo's later.

B00003003R|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I have, I just love waking up in the moring to the great sound of Estranged, eating breakfast with Night train, and going through the day with the other songs on the CD. This is definately a must have for every Guns N roses fan, don't think, just click on Add to shopping cart, if you're just starting with guns n roses, you should get Appetite for Destruction, and after that use your illusion 1 and 2, after that Lies, and if you really have to go for The Spaghetti Incident?, as soon as you'll get to know the fantastic songs and get used to the screaming vocalist Axl, you are ready for this CD. Live recordings of their best songs! It would also make a fantastic birthday present. So, DON'T THINK! Just buy it!
B00000IGGA|5.0|I have to be in a Tom Waits sort of mood to pop this puppy int he player. What kind of mood is that, you ask? Nights with a full moon (dark clouds help), or alone in my room contemplating various subjects that are generally not considered &quot;Happy Thoughts&quot;.
B000000H57|5.0|This album is truely a modern masterpiece.  This is the kind of lush recording where you notice something new every time you listen to it!  There are some brilliant songs present here.  &quot;Love you to death&quot;, &quot;Green Man&quot;, and without question &quot;Haunted&quot; are destined to be classic &quot;metal&quot; songs. The last 2 1/2 minutes of &quot;Haunted&quot; are worth all the goosebumps they bring about.  This is a great cd for driving alone at night!! Or anytime for that matter. Be sure to check out their ENTIRE collection of cds. You will NOT be disappointed!
B00005OB0A|4.0|When Kylie Minogue found her way back to pop after a small turn into something slightly harder it was Light Years beyond anything she had ever done.  She did it again!<br />Fever is a more modern and more cohesive collection than last years Light Years and it is fantastic throughout.  Influences range from 80s electro-pop and dance through the 90s scene to develop something entirely now.  The first single, &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; is proof of that.  The song spent 4 weeks atop the British chart and kept Michael Jackson's abysmal come-back single from the top.  This is no fluke - the song is great and as catchy as hell.<br />Standouts include &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; with it's Modjo like guitars (I love this one), &quot;Fragile&quot; a striking mid-tempo track with a beautiful vocal, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; pure bliss with a reference to last years chart topping, &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and &quot;Burning Up&quot;, which is like nothing else with it's quiet verses and &quot;burning&quot; chorus.<br />The one miss is that there is no ballad and, while it's not necessary, if you've heard &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; or &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; from her 94 album, you'd want one, too! BUT, it's Fun and Fantastic...Feel the Fever!
B0000029LG|4.0|I had heard a few Michael Jackson songs just like everyone else. (Thriller, black and white etc.) The first disc of the two set cd was absolutely incredible.  The songs are immediate hits and seem to stick in your mind like honey. Billy Jean is a perfect song to lead off the track because of a great beat and meaningful lyrics. These are followed by classics such as the way you make me feel, bad and the best of the best, THRILLER. THis cd is an instant hit whether you be old and wanting a look into the past or a kid looking for a good beat to dance to. THe second cd in the set it much weaker hence my 4 star rating. The tracks seem to drag on a little bit and do not have the instant likeable sound of the first cd. They are not the #1 hits heard by all of the world but some new and unreleased tracks. Stay away from cd 2 but cd 1 is an instant classic for everyone. Classic Michael. Buy it and you will be satisfied.
6304602979|4.0|(a great title for this flick) Me, being of a somewhat newer generation, didn't think I'd like this movie from the title alone, but as soon as I read the description, I knew I;d love it. Drugs, prostitution, freedom, and most of all true love; you can't get much better than that. I want to give it four and a half stars. I loved it so much I recorded it &amp; have been watching the movie at least once a day the past few weeks. The two have such a wonderful chemistry together and the cameos are great as well. Everything about this movie is practically perfect; except I'd change the first minute and last minute and a little of the music. It only fits some of the scenes' like at his dads house, the pimp's pad, the telephone booth. Its true romance: reminds me of Sid and Nancy or Bonnie and Clyde except better sometimes. Theres just some sort of feeling this movie captured so wonderfully that most films leave out.  Love it. Its good for both the guys and the chics out there. Yea, man, Its obsession worthy...
B00002NDB1|5.0|No doubt Bruce is better than Blaze, but let's not cast stones, all you Maiden fans KNOW if Bruce was on the vocals for this album you'd give it 5 stars! Theres no 'if ands or buts' about it! This album is GREAT! I love Bruce too (more than Blaze), but lets give credit where credit is due! Steve Harris is still master of song writing, Dave Murray still shredds (as does Janick Gerrs), so get over it! (Again: I LOVE Bruce MUCH better than Blaze), But come on, this album was (is) awsome!
B00003CXWU|2.0|This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman. The film is based on one convict's memoir, and it presents an interesting point or two, but everything in this film has been covered before, in better films.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever.  You need to buy it now, because all your friends have it and are tired of letting you borrow it.  Pop music done right.
B00005QIPH|4.0|&quot;Is this it&quot; brought pre-release hype to new heights so now that the record is out the obvious question is: Does it live up to the hype? Well, of course not. People were expecting the second-coming of the Rolling Stones or the Velvet Underground (post Cale) and the Strokes ain't either. But on the other hand this is a brilliant album and it's most likely to end in my TOP 10 this year. In a time when most (indie) music is ethereal, intimate, slow-paced and, let's be honest, BORING, this comes as a fresh breath of air! The Strokes' most obvious influence is New York Punk from the late '70s (they're always compared to bands such as Television, the Stooges, Velvet Underground and a bunch of others). I particularly love The singer's raw vocals, delivered, as Amazon states, with &quot;weary nonchalance&quot;. All in all, this is a must-have!
B000002UKS|5.0|&quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; may be the best album of the 90's.  This is an excellent collection of rock songs that flow together an actually feel like and ALBUM, not just randomly assorted tracks.  Lots of variety here, ranging from straight ahead rockers to punk-influenced power pop and soothing slow songs.  It amazes me that a major label, radio marketed album such as this can be so amazing, but then again, David Grohl is a great musician, and Nate Mendel was in Sunny Day.  This has so much more depth than the rest of mainstream rock.  In fact, if you listen closely, you hear lots of punk and indie rock overtones.  The Foo Fighters are a band that's bigger than the music industry, that's bigger than your scene, and this is a great album.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I don't really see why pearl harbor got some bad reviews . i do have to admit some TINY parts reminded me of Titanic but overall  the movie was great. the story with danny (Hartnett) and rafe(Affleck) as the best of friends and then the twist of them both falling in love with the same girl gives it flavor. but to add to the suspense the have the war thrown in it so that the love triangle is put on hold and the thing on peoples minds is how to help others and yet survive at the same time. the director had a great cast with award winning ben affleck hot.. josh hartnett and talented Kate beckinsale. i definately am going to buy this video the day it comes out. it is a sad movie but yet it's a great family movie. i highly recommend it!!!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Finally a disc that lives up to the hype.  My big-screen TV and surround sound system love this movie.  A must have for any DVD fan.<br />One complaint though...the English Subtitles can't be turned off.  If they can, I sure as heck can't figure it out.  The options menu seems to be worthless.
B000002KHH|4.0|Well this is a classic.  I first got it on LP a couple of decades ago.  I bought it because of the radio play songs.  You know, the infamous Iron Man and Paranoid.  Well, there is more to that album than meets the MIND.  War Pigs- the album's opener, was originally the title of the album, let's the listener know that they mean business.  Eerie in sound, this song pushes music into a deep, dark realm we call Metal.  My favorite songs are Hand of Doom and Fairies Wear Boots, and Electric Funeral.  These songs show the talent of the band.  They have a strong blues influence mixed with a jazz flavor.  Indeed they have their own style, which is seen in many of today's music.
B00005NI5Y|3.0|Bob Dylan this set is really interesting in that He finds His Music&amp;Feel again.my knock on Him is His Voice&amp;overall I Prefer His Older Material better.but make no doubt about it He has a Pretty Good Album here that will hang with what's going on now easily.He has His Lyrical Content in check&amp;The Production is Good.it's worth listening to&amp;Hearing somebody out there that still knows what they are doing.some things don't work but for the most part this is a Good Collection.
0930289528|5.0|V sits perfectly on my shelf next to Brave New World &amp; 1984. Comics-Noir meets Ayn Rand. The chilling surrealist story is perfectly complimented by the dramatic visual presentation. It's a gripping as a Stanley Kubrik movie. 5 stars are simply not enough for this monumental testament.
B00005QGAV|4.0|I enjoyed this Album when it dropped ten years back&amp;I think it has held up especially on the Groove side.this Remaster really doesn't bring anything for me.I wonder why the Bonus Disc got Dropped??nevertheless MJ&amp;Teddy Riley connect here.the other Tracks are Hit&amp;Miss but overall it was a Risky Move on MJ's Part&amp;for the Most part it works.
B000002J29|5.0|Because after that, the steeped down roll-off would overcome.<BR>This is the last album any serious Genesis lover should buy. Then the supergroup sadly became an average radio trio or quartet -even quintet- of commercial composers. For those few who believed Peter Gabriel was not the heart and mind of Genesis, just listen to this and then pick 1993's The Shorts and The Longs.
0201633612|1.0|The topic is great. But it is extremly hard to figure out what the authors are trying to tell. <br />It is just like I am reading some randomly generated sentences.<br />The reason, I guess,  might be the authors themselve didn't understand those patterns.
0804102988|5.0|For a historical monument of which so little is known Mr. Rutherford sure makes you feel like you're actually living it.<BR>The depth of the story is mind boggling yet it doesn't bog down like other epics. Every character actually has credibility and depth. The monuments method of construction is highly credible.<BR>Brilliance of this type needs recognition.<BR>Little else needs to be said.
B000002WYT|5.0|On a long car trip, one of the passengers suggested a CD and willingly offered &quot;Crash&quot; by Dave Matthews. This wasn't my first experience with Dave, I already owned &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming.&quot; But my favorite of the three is definately &quot;Crash&quot;. <BR>It's one of those CD's that are good for the end of the day when you're tired and stressed out and need peace. This CD IS peace. Listen to the whole thing and I guarantee you will be ready to fall asleep and forget everything about the day. The music is so outstanding and so original, it would be worth the money alone. And then you add Dave's voice singing the lyrics(which may, at times, make no sense...does &quot;Proudest Monkey&quot; give you a hint?) and you have created peace. This is the CD that shows off DMB the best, so it is obviously a must have for all fans. And it is perfect for a tired, human life.
B000002HD5|5.0|When I fell for Greg Dulli, I fell hard. It was 1993 and I was in tenth grade. I listened to &quot;Gentlemen&quot; every day. With that said, this album isn't for everyone. But you should listen to it anyway. It has everything to do with excellent guitar playing, song composition, and Greg Dulli's unrivaled delivery and phrasing. He is a rock n'roll genius. And that's what &quot;Gentlemen&quot; is, a great rock n' roll album.<BR>I have re-discovered the Whigs (even though they are no more) just this year. I stopped buying their albums because I was certain NOTHING could be as good as this one. I was wrong, if you like this album, buy &quot;1965&quot;. It's equally amazing. Greg Dulli is once again igniting every spark in my soul and singing it into the ground. There is no one (who's white) that can sing like him.<BR>Another note, astronaut Neil Armstrong absoutely adores the Afghan Whigs.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Back in the days before Pantera were known as the \\"Cowboys from Hell,\\" they were into glam metal and released records that didn't sell very good at all. Finally, they dropped the trendy look and released \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" after four albums.<br />The best songs on this album would have to be \\"Cowboys from Hell,\\" \\"Primal Concrete Sledge,\\" \\"Psycho Holiday,\\" \\"Heresy,\\" \\"Cemetery Gates,\\" \\"Domination,\\" \\"Shattered,\\" \\"Medicine Man,\\" and \\"The Art of Shredding\\". <br />The only songs I don't like a whole lot, but do not mind are \\"Clash with Reality,\\" \\"Message in Blood,\\" and \\"The Sleep\\".<br />Here is my rating for every song on the album:<br /> 1.

0792844793|5.0|David Lynch's provocative film, BLUE VELVET, is a dark masterpiece of post-modern art. For what does all art aspire to do? I would claim, to tear away our illusions of the world in which we live; To strip away the false faade and reveal to us that which we do not want to see, but that we know is there. Lynch does this by attacking a small town and removing the idyllic surface and showing us all the murk that boils beneath. My favourite shot in the film is of a bed of roses, where Lynch has added (through his brilliant use of audio) a surreal, distorted noise that sounds like a thousand insects creeping and crawling. Dennis hopper stars as the embodiment of evil, Jack Booth, who's truly one of the most psychotic persons to ever appear on film. He has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Kyle Maclachlan's characters sums it all up by asking, \\"why are there people like Frank?\\" But there's also beauty in this film. Isabella Rossilini standing on stage singing the title song, BLUE VELVET, is a wonderful image. Lynch isn't just preoccupied with tearing away at everything. Once in a while he seems prepared to start building things up again from scratch; Certainly there's hope somewhere. BLUE VELVET is easily one of the most important contemporary American films. It's a must see for any one interested in film (not having seen BLUE VELVET for a film buff is like an art student not having seen Picasso's painting of the Spanish civil war).
B00000DQSZ|5.0|One of the best all synthesizer albums EVER! This was my first Kraftwerk record and still one of my favorites. T.E.E sounds modern today, even though it was released in 1977. It is obvious that many bands in the 1980's threw today have been influenced by this piece of work along with their other albums. &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; is a great avaunt club number, while &quot;T.E.E (the song)&quot; adds a strange ambience to the album.
B00004YKUY|4.0|I enjoyed listening to this cd arrival by Journey. It it great<BR>in the 21st century to have all original and clean material<BR>from the quintent Journey featuring Neal Schon guitar, Ross Valory bass, Jonathan Cain keyboards and two new members Deen<BR>Castronova drums and Steve Augieri vocals. I found Higher Place<BR>the first track that stands out as the best with a rocking mode.<BR>To Be alive again, World Gone Wild and Nothin Comes Close also<BR>are good too. I would say the only criticism would be a few too<BR>many ballads or light moments. New members Steve Augieri vocals does a great job replacing Steve Perry on vocals having his own unique style and Deen Castronova replacing New England Native Steve Smith on drums with fast fills and power. The content of the songs is top notch along with great songwriting from Neal Schon, Jon Cain, and Jack Blades formerly with Damm Yankees and <BR>Night Ranger. It is also great to see original members Neal Schon and Ross Valory bass giving the trademark rock sound of Journey a new lease on life, and with the last track WE WILL MEET AGAIN it is only fitting Journey has many miles left in its<BR>future.
B00003W8NM|2.0|Fight Club has all the right messages, but it delivers it in all the wrong ways. This movie is meant to be a social satire, supposed to make us think about our society. What we own owns us, not the other way around. Corporate America controls our lives. These are true messages, ones that I couldn't agree more with. The problem is, you can't degrade corporate America when you ARE corporate America. The great message in this film loses it's genuity when the movie is so hypocritical. 21st Century Fox produced this movie to make money, which is everything that this movie opposed. Open your eyes people. This movie is a fraud.
B000002MUN|5.0|This is Tom Petty's finest album. He made it at a time when he realized he wasn't getting any younger, his midlife crisis work with Jeff Lynne past him, battling the end of his marriage; all those strange feelings were condensed and channeled through his songwriting, and the result was the magnificent WILDFLOWERS. It's Petty's first album produced by Rick Rubin (who had already lent his talents to the Heartbreakers' teriffic &quot;Mary Jane's Last Dance&quot; the previous year), and the earthy, crisp sound is a perfect compliment to both Petty's voice and his songs. The beauty of Tom Petty's music is both the casual ease he seems to effortlessly slip into, and the way his songs just manage to stick in your head. At first listen, you'll always find one or two songs that stand out, and certainly the others are good, but not necessarily great. But then, they get stuck. Try as you might, you simply can't get them out of your head. And it's at this point that you realize, all these other songs are just as great. And by that time, you realize just how beautiful the album is. WILDFLOWERS is no exception. The simple instrumentation (powered by Steve Ferrone's minimal drumming) hides the complexity of the work.<br />Lyrically, this is also Petty's strongest album to date. &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels&quot; and &quot;Hard On Me&quot; deal with the pain of isolation, the fear of loneliness. Songs like &quot;Only A Broken Heart&quot; and the title track are almost reassurances, like he's saying it's okay to feel this pain, you're headed somewhere better. &quot;A Higher Place&quot; and &quot;It's Good To Be King&quot; have a twinge of cynicism beneath their ideologies, while &quot;To Find A Friend&quot; and &quot;Crawling Back To You&quot; are about the pain of a relationship (the latter especially touching). And in &quot;Wake Up Time,&quot; a very fitting coda, Petty especially confronts his age, with wisdom, reflection, even a little pessimism and wonder (&quot;You were so cool, back in high school, What happened?&quot;).<br />Musically, while most of the Heartbreakers did end up contributing a lot towards the album (certainly much more than on FULL MOON FEVER), this is a Tom Petty solo album, so it allows for more creative arrangements, and plenty of guest stars. Ringo Starr plays drums on &quot;To Find A Friend,&quot; the wonderful slide guitarist Marty Rifkin is buried deep in the mix on &quot;House In The Woods,&quot; and Petty himself even takes his hand at lead guitar on a couple of numbers. There are a few absolute get-yer-yayas-out jam tunes, &quot;You Wreck Me&quot; and especially &quot;Honey Bee,&quot; sort of the sweatier, swampier second-cousin to &quot;Mary Jane's Last Dance.&quot; Petty would continue to record teriffic music, more or less with his fellow Heartbreakers, but he'd never quite reach this level of sophistication and artistry again. A must-own.
0060977493|5.0|This is the best novel I have read in a very long time.  Poetic, moving, inspiring.  One of the reviewers here described this book as difficult to finish because it was so depressing.  My impression was quite the opposite.  True, lots of sad events take place in this book; but it was catharitic like a Greek tragedy.  Great things are never valued as much as in the wake of their loss.  I was touched by the scenes of the love between the twins and their mother, by the descriptions of the so-eager-to-be-loved and pompous uncle, and by the horrible cruelty that some characters in this book were capable of.  The scene of the lovers (near the end of the book) is perhaps the most sensuous and erotic scene I ever read.
B00005NW02|5.0|I had a lot of fun listening to this cd. I thought that each song was very demanding, musical, and sometimes brutal! Serj is the best vocalist I have ever heard, I love his accent, and Daron does a great job too. I was so psyched about getting this album, but in the process, downloaded the cd off of KaZaA already! Overall, I hope that Toxicity or Aerials is made into a music video and hits TRL.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Thank you George Lucas for finally putting a Star Wars movie onto the DVD format.  This DVD is a must have for every Star Wars fan who owns a DVD player.  The movie images are razor sharp and the sound is so good, it's like watching the movie the first time, everytime.<br />Even the documentary DVD is worth watching with alot of features.<br />Thanks again Mr. Lucas from a life long Star Wars fan.
6305622825|3.0|If you're a movie buff,you've seen this kind of formula caper film too often already.Don't you think that SEAN CONNERY has played these roles to death by now,after 40 years?It would be fun if he played a grandfather for a change.We're lucky to have CATHERINE ZETA-JONES ,who with her beauty makes it tolerable to watch.But maybe you're not a movie buff,and you just want to be entertained for 114 minutes after a hard day at work,then this is for you.Watch out,you might fall asleep on your couch.You'll be glad to go to bed even if you are alone.What about the story you might ask?Who cares really?Don't bother.
B000000QFV|5.0|Sadly, this album has been severly overlooked. Tony Martin's<BR>dio-esque vocals really shine on this effort. If you're a fan of Medieval style hard rock/heavy metal, ala Rainbow, Dio, Deep Purple, Whitesnake, etc., This disc belongs on your list. Every song rocks. I particularily like tracks 5,6,and 7. &quot;The Battle of TYR&quot; leads into &quot;Odin's Court&quot;, which in turn leads into &quot;Valhalla&quot;. 'Blew me away the first time I heard it! Other tracks to check out include, &quot;Lawmaker&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, and &quot;Feels Good to Me&quot;. Go ahead and pick up this gem. You won't be disappointed.
0312243022|3.0|I felt myself to be at a disadvantage after reading other reviews, lacking in knowledge of Virginia Woolfe's background. For that reason, I don't think the novel spoke as clearly to me, although Ms. Woolfe was my favorite character of all.<br />The author weaves three characters together, visiting each with their unique personalities, until they join together at the ending chapter. I found myself frequently wondering how Mr. Cunningham found his way to such a novel approach. However, I probably would not reread THE HOURS, for all its vivid imagery, from dead sparrows to roses. I couldn't seem to locate the depth in those who lived among the pages.
0812550706|5.0|With Ender's Game Orson Scott Card elevates Sci-fi to the level of great literature. Not an easy feat. The list of Sci-fi authors who have done this can be counted on one hand. Mickey Mouse's hand.(Azimov.Herbert.Bradbury.Heinelin.)After the first chapter the trappings of space ships and insectiod aliens become secondary to the trials and tribulations of a 6 year old boy. While I enjoy &quot;pulpy&quot; sci-fi, I realize it is just that. Pulp. Few books ever remain in my memory a week after I read them. They are time killers. Ender's Game isn't. I recommend this book to all my friends who are not Sci-fi fans. Their reviews are unanimous. This is a good book.
6304211740|4.0|The sets and costumes are really really great, but the highlight of this film is the truly wonderful acting on the part of William Hurt. He plays the elusive, eccentric country noble Mr. Rochester exactly the way he should be played. He's quietly passionate, sexy, and smoldering, while still exhibiting signs of being a real stuffy gentleman. Inwardly tormented, Rochester is perfect.<br />Charlotte Gainsbourg takes on the challenging role of the title character, petit and plain Jane Eyre. Gainsbourg's unearthly prettiness adds immeasurably to her character, but she represses some of Jane Eyre's passion that we find in the book. The chemistry between Gainsbourg and Hurt is tense and shaky - exactly how it should be.<br />Zeffirelli has created the best screen version of this book that I have ever seen!
044022425X|3.0|&quot;Drums of Autumn,&quot; the fourth novel in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, continues the adventures of eighteenth-century Highlander Jamie Fraser and his time-travelling twentieth-century wife Claire.  Recently arrived in the American colonies after the shipwreck that ended &quot;Voyager,&quot; Jamie and Claire, along with Jamie's nephew Ian, make their way to the mountains of western North Carolina to establish their new home (after the requisite meetings with relatives, bandits, and other assorted colorful characters).  Meanwhile back in 1969 Boston, their daughter Brianna makes a horrible discovery about her parents' demise and decides to journey back in time herself to prevent that.  She is followed by Roger Wakefield, the dashing Scottish historian, who always shows up a little too late to prevent the headstrong Brianna from getting into major trouble.<br />Brianna and Roger are the two major reasons I did not enjoy &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; nearly as much as the other books.  They are in many ways the typical couple to be found in historical romances--Brianna is at once whiny and stubborn, while Roger is overbearing.  Gabaldon uses the classic (and annoying) romance devices of miscommunication and &quot;whose child is this?&quot; to further their story along.  Jamie and Claire are, as always, great characters, but Gabaldon's tendency of making sure every bad event has closure (and good ones as well, since she drags in John Gray and Jamie's son Willie) stretches thin the already thin suspension of disbelief necessary to make the time-travel idea work.  Overall, Gabaldon's work is miles above other romance writers (and, at heart, these books are romances), but &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; is definitely the weakest in the series.
B00005221L|5.0|This movie has a GREAT plot and superb action sequences. This has to be one of Schwarzenegger's best movies. The scene when Arnold and the Predator fight is GREAT! I recommend this movie to si-fi fans.
0312954468|3.0|If the Egyptians had TV soap operas, this would have been one of their stories.  In fact I'm surprised Taita didn't invent the TV in his spare time.  Only difference between modern soaps and this book is that this book has much less sex and a whole lot more violence.   It was entertaining to a point, and the author clearly has a grand imagination.  A good beach read if you can stomach the raw violence

630027179X|5.0|This is probably the best movie version of the Arthur story, most of the details from Sir Thomas Mallory's book &quot;La Morte D'Arthur&quot; are included and magically depicted here. Outstanding special effects make it as real as it can be done, I first watched this movie when it first came out, and now that I own a copy I can't stop watching it. It is a movie which shows an age of magic, courtly love, chilvalry, and novelty, together with tradegy and sword fighting makes this a must have. It is one of the greatest epics ever produced by the film industry, and with it's outstanding background music it is just extraordinary, a great purchase for any fan of Arthurian legneds and also for any fan of the film industry, that wishes to watch, what I believe as well as most if not everyone to be a masterpiece.

0783216084|5.0|A simple story about a New England resort community that is terrorized by a giant killer shark.  Half of the movie focuses on the shark attacks, human reactions, and character development between Brody, Hooper, Quint, Mayor Vaughn, and so forth.  The second half of the movie focuses on human intervention - Brody, Hooper, and Quint try to kill the shark.  In between there is Oscar-winning film editing, sound, and a now-classic score by maestro John Williams.  'Jaws' was unjustly ignored at Oscar time, especially for screenplay, acting (Scheider, Dreyfuss, and especially Shaw), and director Spielberg.  Roger Ebert was right when he reviewed this movie - &quot;In keeping the Great White offscreen, Spielberg was employing a strategy used by Alfred Hitchcock throughout his career. 'A bomb is under the table, and it explodes: That is surprise,' said Hitchcock. 'The bomb is under the table but it does not explode: That is suspense.'&quot; Spielberg is doing the same thing for most of this movie. The audience doesn't see the shark, but the underlying result of its actions. So, for the audiences who claim this is simply slow-paced fluff where the shark is hardly seen for about three-quarters of the film, put Mr. Ebert's review of the film into your pipe and smoke it.

B000001DYJ|5.0|One word defines this album ~ Kulick!  Buy It Now!
B00003CWL6|5.0|This being one of my top three all-time favorite movies, I was careful to read the unfavorable reviews on Amazon before I donated my own. The general consensus of those people giving American Beauty 2 stars or lower is that it is &quot;unbelievable.&quot; Generally, these people refer to the characters, the plot, all that composes American Beauty's quirkiness. How do I respond to that?<br />If you found American Beauty &quot;unbelievable,&quot; then the film was a success. This isn't a movie about taking what we've already seen, it's about taking what we've always been afraid to show. The fact that people are shocked by it and have trouble finding the truth in this film means that it has succeeded in all accounts. If you find this film offensive, if you find it too risque, if you find it &quot;unbelievable&quot; then you are the prime reason why it was absolutely necessary that this film be made.<br />American Beauty appears &quot;unbelievable,&quot; I'll admit that; but that is only because we are all so negligent to our own hypocrisy. So many of us REFUSE to relate to Lester, or Caroline, or Angela, even though we secretly know just how dead on their portrayal is. We can say Lester blackmailing his boss is unbelievable, or we can admit that we would have more than a little ambition to do the same when it came our way. We can say that Lester's idealized fantasy with a teenager is unbelievable, or we can look at the mean of male society and understand that most men would have jumped at the opportunity that he had.<br />American Beauty's greatest gift is it's concentration of pure truth. This may be a hard fact for most people to understand and they may deny it to themselves, but keep in mind that with such a diverse selection of characters, humanity can not totally distance itself from EVERY character. Every one holds some internal truth for ever viewer, if they are willing to accept it and not rush to the extremes that classify the whole film as &quot;unbelievable.&quot;<br />This film just makes sense; it had to be made; the fact that it turned out so well is amazing. Every time I watch it, I conclude the viewing with the phrase &quot;you learn something new every time.&quot; And that is the absolute truth. I become more in tune with my own self every time I watch it; I reach an area of my existence that I have never seen before; I understand my motivations with a new and heightened perception. American Beauty doesn't do that by taking vacant stabs in the dark, it does it by showing humanity's most disavowed characteristics, the ones we regret, we deny, we term unbelievable when it applies to ourselves. <br />This film is a classic. Perhaps it will gain a greater mainstream audience with time, but there is no reason we cannot apreciate it now. The image is recent: of turn of the century life in America. This is US, at our best and our worst. If you're not going to believe just how depraved you are, then you have no reason to believe how moral you are. We are a species plagued with both sides of the spectrum. American Beauty is one of the first films to show this. If only people would Look Closer.
B000001EXR|5.0|This is a must have... check out the new version of &quot;I Walk Alone&quot; recorded by Bruce Kulick and UNION!  This is rock guitar at its finest!  Bruce Kulick and Eric Carr made Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons rock harder... if they hadn't, Kiss would be an 80's dinosaur, relegated to special issues of magazines.  (laugh)<br />This album illustrates that Bruce Kulick has NO problem walking alone.  Check out his solo album, AudioDog!  Bruce &quot;has your rock... right here!&quot;
B000002AS1|3.0|It's been my experience that Alan Silvestri either gravitates to gung-ho action films, or modest comedies that require a light scoring hand.  Forrest Gump is, obviously, one of the later, and perhaps Silvestri's best in that category, however the continuity of the album is not nearly as rounded and sustained as it could be.<br />Perhaps the greatest hindrance to this otherwise admirable score are the track lengths.  Only one track is longer than three minutes, and that is an uninspired &quot;suite&quot; that does NOT include the main theme, but does manage to tack on some material that doesn't involve the rest of the score.<br />The Main/innocence theme is pretty, and where it recurs is appropriate and suitable, but take in mind that this doesn't happen often.  The score is dominated by more emotional cues that are considerably less exciting and less entertaining.  Prehaps the highlight of the score is the most upbeat and invogorating of the several themes, best exemplified in the The Crimson Gump track.<br />All in all, the score worked great in the film and there is a lot of good music to be listened to on the album, however poor packaging, poor selection, and an orchestra that sounded to me to be somewhat out of tune ruins this otherwise excellent CD.  It won't hurt the listener to get Silvestri's compilation album of Cast Away to get as much material from Gump as necessary, as well as exposure to some of his other, better material from film's past.
B00005N9CV|2.0|So somebody in sales & marketing had a brilliant idea at the last biz-brainstorm: \\"Hey, gang, I wonder what would happen if we dunk Diana Krall in a vat of Revlon,get a couple of African honeybees to sting her lips, strategically place her meemies in the center of her next CD cover, and tart her up in a negligee from Frederick's of Hollywood?\\"<br />The answer: you'll generate a whole lot of \\"out-of-thin-air\\" buzz and suddenly inexplicable unit-shifting sales by an artist who, in the pantheon of modern stylists, is rather on the middling side. Since somebody decided to send her to Glamor Shots, the whole record-buying public is instantly enamored of Diana Krall. It's \\"Oh yeah...Diana Krall is hot. She's SO in and SO de rigeur,\\" or \\"Did you buy the new Diana Krall? No?!? Don't you have any taste?\\"<br />HELLO! This CD is a far more fabulous tribute to savvy marketing prowess (and the shallow tendency of Americans to gravitate toward anything with a well-photographed set of ta-tas) than a tribute to the talent of an outstanding artist who deserves to be heard by millions. Krall can sing, but her rendering of songs like \\"Love Letters\\" et al. brings absolutely nothing new or unique or superior in terms of delivery or interpretation. As sturdy and as BLAND as a bowl of white rice. The arrangements are not even that extraordinary. A very ordinary album...and it's kind of a sad statement about our general American taste in music that \\"ordinary\\" can so mesmerize us--as long as glossy lipstick, and nicely-done hair are part of the packaging. Kudos to the photographer and marketing grunts on this record. Diana, take the money from this trumped-up hype of a record and buy yourself some INNER sparkle. Kiss Kiss.
B00005NI5Y|1.0|As a long time fan of Bob Dylan, and as one who has dutifully bought every album that he has ever produced, I have to repectfully disagree with all the reviews which I have read. With one exception, I find the songs on Love and Theft to be almost unlistenable. As I look back on the last couple of decades of Dylan albums, I find an interesting trend: Each record contains one gem amidst a lot of filler. Songs like Not Dark Yet, Every Grain of Sand, Born in time, Brownsville Girl, Series of Dreams, and the recent Things Have Changed (which did not appear on an album) all sparkle like diamonds discovered in a rock pile. Perhaps Bob only has one great song in him per year, and maybe that's enough, maybe that's as much as any great poet has ever produced.The gem on this album is Missisippi, and it is, by itself, worth the price of the record.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This DVD is a necessity for any true DVD collection. If you thought the special effects and picture was amazing in the theatre, you should see the job Lucas Arts has done on this DVD. The special bonus cd is another huge amazing compulation of deleted material and bonus schematics. If this is just the beginning abilities of DVD creations by Lucas Arts, then waiting for Episodes IV, V, and VI has just officially become unbarable. Trust me when I say that this DVD is probably the best DVD ever to be released.

0061040967|5.0|I must admit that when I first saw this book I thought &quot;Graphic Novel? Ugh&quot; thinking that it would be little more than a cartoon strip effort - I was very very wrong...<br />From page one the as ever brilliant illustrations by Kirby help bring the Discworld to life like never before, from the highly amusing drawings of Rincewind (so that's what he looks like!) to the not-so-subtle Cistene(?)-Chappel-like background picture of Cohen and Blind Io.<br />As for the story, after going off the boil a bit in some of his later books, Pratchett manages to keep his 'revival' of highly amusing and intelligent Discworld stories well on track with this latest effort.<br />All I can say without giving away the story is that anyone who DOESNT buy this cannot call him(her)self a true Discworld fan!
0714834491|4.0|This is a massive graphical, cultural, philosophical tour de force likes of which I have rarely seen. Extremely strong in graphics, less so in philosophy, but  very, very interesting. Reading it is like drinking from a firehose at times: Open it randomly, and you are likely to find something worthwhile, something to think about, something to be inspired by. It also happens to have more good quotes than a typical quote dictionary. A rewarding addition to an eclectic library of a creative individual.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Hole's still my favorite punk band. I dont care how hard they try....they're still punk too me.Which is good...now expect for (Heaven Tonight,and mabye Boys on the Radio) this album isnt poppy at all...its just the bands craftmanship and musicanship have improved, thats all,and thats a good thing right?? I dont think Courtney was really going for pop..i just think she wanted too try something different..and Hole's not the first band too do that..&lt;they come out with a few good albums..expirement w/ their sound a bit..and go back too doing the music started off doing&gt; or mabye she was just trying to see if it was possible too actually make a &quot;good&quot; pop record...if thats the case then she has succedded.Though we all know a good pop record is a rareity.The opening track Celebrity Skin..is really good..and uses some really catchy chords. Malibu is great..i dont care what kinda music you like,anybody would like this song. Northern Star is kind of folky &lt;Courtney deffenitly has a little Stevie Nicks in her voice&gt; Playing Your Song..the closest thing too Live Though This (other than Reasons to be Beautiful) on the album....is where Courtney addresses Cobain's death...and is one of the best on the cd. Hit So Hard i'll never get tired of..excellent song!!<BR>and still if the thought of buying a pop record just makes you gag then not too worry.. if you've heard anything about Hole's up &amp; coming stuff..not to mention Courtney's side-project &quot;Bastard&quot; i seriously doubt the current state of Hole is going too.
B00002ND77|5.0|I can't think of another filmmaker besides Spike Lee who's as qualified to direct this 3-hour epic about the slain leader Malcolm X.  It was really the film he was born to make.  Although it falls a notch below &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (still his best film and a qualified classic), it features a dead-on performance by Denzel Washington.  Denzel definitely deserved to win an Academy Award, though he lost to Al Pacino.  But Oscar or no Oscar, this DVD is worth picking up: the picture and sound are excellent with no print flaws, scratches, lines, or marks whatsoever.  My only beef is that the film has no extras except production notes.  It's my sincere hope that Warner Brothers will revisit this film and come out with a deluxe 2-DVD edition, for this is too important a film.  If you haven't grabbed this, then what are you waiting for?
B00003CX5P|4.0|Me being the true skeptic i was scared when purchasing this dvd. But for the truely skeptic my words won't matter as your minds have all ready been made up.(hee hee) The deleted scenes part i thought could've been longer. I mean 7 scenes you would think would last like a half an hour or somewhere about that. There are some pretty cool features on this disc. The sound and picture quality BLOWS AWAY the video cassette!!!! The begining feature was pretty cool and interesting. My only other complaint is just Jar Jar is truely ******* annoying. Also enjoyed the mini interviews with cast. Not to give away anything but Ewan M.(Obi-wan) has one of best lines in the &quot;making of&quot; feature...Overall it has my seal of approval and should at least quench the thirst for other star wars dorks...
B000050XEI|4.0|There are some songs you can't forget. A few days after Sept. 11, a radio station took 'Only Time.' By adding sound clips from the tragidies, they made the song more memorable than it already is. I cried when I heard that gentle music. It was so powerful, I bought the album.
0446310786|4.0|I liked the book. It was interesting how the book was based on a flashback, insted of a present time.
0553573403|4.0|I got off to a slow start with this book, but then I am used to the epics by Terry Goodkind or Robert Jordan.  I trudged through this book, and started to realy enjoy myself after about 100 pages.  This author is extremely thurough in approaching a political conflict between powerful families, and just as insightful when writing the conflicting emotions every person feels  when faced with decisions that can have a life and realm altering affect.  The next book in this series get even better... and this is one author out of all that I have read that truley understands the concept of a series.  The first book, setting the scene, the second pulling you into the story, and choosing side ... the the third almost peaking to the climax of the story.  Almost like a good song.  If you are a fan of epic fantsy, then Martin is a 'must buy'
079073382X|5.0|The film was a complete surprise; I was expecting some silly teen movie. What I saw, rather, was one of the most inspiring and romantic movies I've ever seen. Linklater turns a clichéd premise into a lyrical and timeless piece of art. I don't think I've encountered such innocence and sublime simplicity before, perhaps with the exception of D.W. Griffith's TRUE HEART SUSIE (1919). <br />The only other romances that personally inspired me were Frank Borzage's STREET ANGEL(1928) and HISTORY IS MADE AT NIGHT(1937). BEFORE SUNRISE lacks Borzage's Christian transcendence and soft-focus dexterity, but undeniably it belongs to the Pantheon of great romances. It is remarkable how a film can be so simple in premise and technique, and at the same time leave you unforgettable impressions. As Dave McCoy correctly observed, the film achieves emotional and spiritual depth that one may ordinarily find in a Bresson or a Rohmer film. Ethan Hawke may seem a bit irritating, but Julie Delpy is simply divine. <br />Don't ever miss this film.
0792156684|4.0|Well, I have this movie on DVD. The movie was great, but they didn't have the film in Full Frame on DVD. So I had to watch it at a 2.85.1 Widescreen format. Also, there were no behind the scenes about how they made the movie Titanic. The only thing on this DVD was just the movie. I wish they would of put more interactive stuff on this DVD, or should of made a box set at lest. Disc One (Widescreen), Disc Two (Full Frame). So if you are a person who loves more than just a movie on DVD, don't count on getting it! You will only just get the movie in Widescreen format.

His personality looms large, even after the public's fascination with the space program has waned.  His accounts of the events surrounding the early days of the space program, the moon landings, and the following steps of man's ventures into space are a must-read for anyone interested in an accurate account of the unparalleled achievements by NASA in its early days.<br />In addition to giving his viewpoint on several well-known and frequently retold events -- as so many books on the space program do -- Kranz gives some as-yet-untold perspective on key parts of the program that are often overlooked.  In particular, Kranz shares the details that went into the development of the processes that were required to send men into space and return them safely to the earth.  He relates just what a monumental task it was to create the mission rules, the flight plans, and the contingencies that made the program a success.  <br />Also newly told was Kranz's recount of the scene in Mission Control as Apollo 11 approached a moon landing and program alarms began to sound in the lunar module -- and the role simulations played in saving the day.<br />&quot;Failure Is Not An Option&quot; is more of an historical account than a novel ... and it's much better that way.
0790729407|4.0|Excellent acting by Liam Neeson and Stephen Rea, but Julia Roberts and Alan Rickman lose their Irish accents at times and overact at others.  Great recreations of Dublin of 80-85 years ago.  Very moving scenes involving the Irish people fighting an oppressive British rule, although I would have liked Neil Jordan to have been historically accurate about the British violence in the stadium (a dozen persons killed and no armored vehicles) and not been ambiguous about de Valera being involved in Collins' death (since Jordan believes that he had nothing to do with it, according to an interview in a good documentary on the film, which is included on the DVD).
B00000K19E|5.0|When asked at the first session of a recent movie making class I was taking, &quot;what is your favorite movie of all time?&quot; -- this was it!<br />Of course there are breathtaking action sequences, moody camera direction et al. But what made this my FAVORITE was the ideas behind the ideas behind the ideas.<br />I bought The Matrix on DVD without seeing it in the theater. A host of friends recommended it and I had just purchased a new PC with DVD capability. My first viewing was exciting. Special effects which now seem commonplace were new, the widescreen format exciting even on my 19 inch monitor.<br />The more times I watched, the more I saw. The first few minutes of green tinged footage started to make sense. Understanding that it was SUPPOSED to be green, limited the time I spent trying unsuccessfully to get those flesh colors correct on my monitor. As I became familiar with the story line and knew what is coming next, the freedom to explore not only the ideas inherent in the storyline, but the actions taking place in the background revealed even more layers of meaning. <br />If you have a DVD - ROM drive, you can watch the movie WITH the art director, the female lead and another director [embarrassed blush here as I don't remember director of what :)]. This voiceover version is like sitting on the couch with the principals and listening to their memories of &quot;when we were making&quot;. <br />Yesterday I installed  a REAL DVD player for my large screen digital TV and can't WAIT to see it slightly larger.<br />My favorite line? No contest.<br />&quot;There IS no spoon ...&quot;
B00004Z459|5.0|Forget comparisons to Limp Bisquick or whatever they're called, Linkin Park are the new overlords, and this album must be added to your collection today!! Every track can be truly described as a gem, with different facets revealed with each new listen. Chester Bennington has an incredible voice, conveying desires and disgust, frustration and fury with an almost tender delivery. He is amazing. I agree though that they need to lose that rapper, he is VERY weak and tends to shift the focus off Chester at times which ruins the overall effect. Once they do that, the sound will be more streamlined and more intense, if that is possible.  This is an intense record. To some, this may seem like endless grating cacophony, but give it a chance -- it is some of the most beautiful noise ever created.
B000050XEI|1.0|Or &quot;A Day Without Gain,&quot; or &quot;Enya's Attempt at Substanceless Pop.&quot; Needless to say, I was enraged after purchasing this CD. Not only is it barely over 1/2 an hour long and costing full price, but it has the poppest lyrics of any of her recordings yet! For example, the subjects on &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; have fallen from the innovative first person singular to the typical maintstream &quot;you&quot; of pop. Gone are any of the poetic, abstract, introspective lyrics of &quot;The Memory of Trees.&quot; The layers have been stripped away and what we get in this cd is a dumbed-down, fluffed-up and washed-out version of her previous recordings. The songs all sound the same, only some are more annoying in their repetitive catch-phrases than others. If I hadn't wasted actual money on it, I'd have been rolling on the floor laughing at the magnitude of the commercial fluff exponent to which this latest of enya's recordings has been raised.
080017948X|5.0|This is a great movie.  Definately Bill Murray's best yet.  This is a story about a selfish, ..., weatherman who goes to Punxatauney, PA to do a report on Groundhog Day.  He wakes up the next day only to find it Groundhog Day again, and again, and again, and again!  This is hilarious and really touches your heart.  Great acting.  Do yourself the favor of renting this movie.
6301247485|2.0|I am a high school student and just finished reading and discussing F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'. The book is wonderful. This movie is not. First, the movie does NOT stick to the book well, at times, extra scenes were added which did not add to the overall plot at all. In fact, it just made the movie seem frightfully dull. The actors, as well, were not well picked. I especially was displeased with Mia Farrow as Daisy. Robert Redford did possess Gatsby's good looks, but lacked the charm and mystique that was so important to his character. Why the two stars instead of one? Howard da Silva's very short appearence as Meyer Wolfsheim. At least they got something right.
B00005N7Z1|3.0|For me the best sci-fi of the eighties.I must say that the best thing of this Dvd are the new soundtrack in 5.1 the subtitles and the spanish language track(very funny by the way).<br />The rest of special features in this Dvd are lower compared to The Criterion Collection which featured many extras like the X rated scenes cut to avoid excessive reviews for the explicit violence and the story boards(image to film comparation).<br />At least it may be include an behind the scenes document not the low and wrongly teaser trailer that features the Terminator soundtrack.<br />Definetly a good title but with flop special features that only deserve 3 of 5 stars.I wait for a special edition like The Terminator from the same studio.

6302794331|5.0|Charles Dickens' classic tale &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; has probably been adapted for stage, screen, and TV more than any other story in the history of literature. Many have been really great -- the Mr. Magoo animated version, Patrick Stewart's one-man stage show, the George C. Scott version, etc. But one of the best is definitely &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol,&quot; directed with heart and intelligence by Brian Henson. This version is particularly noteworthy because it combines two beloved pop-culture icons: Dickens' story and the Jim Henson Muppets.<br />It's been a long time since I read Dickens' original text, but from what I remember, the MCC is quite faithful to Dickens. Like the other Muppet films, MCC combines human actors with the whimsical Muppet characters (just in case you don't know what a Muppet is, it's a sort of puppet). The great Michael Caine plays Scrooge, and the Muppets play other Dickens characters: Kermit the Frog is Bob Cratchit, Miss Piggy is Mrs. Cratchit, etc.<br />One clever touch is having Charles Dickens (portrayed by Muppet Gonzo the Great) appear as a narrator in the film. Gonzo/Dickens is accompanied by Rizzo the Rat, and the two have some great comic banter and slapstick humor. This device nicely complements the main story without distracting from it. The film is enhanced by some lovely songs; my favorite is the one sung by the Ghost of Christmas Present.<br />Dickens' original &quot;Carol&quot; is, at its core, a compassionate and life-affirming story, and the Muppet version is right on target in preserving the soul of the tale. There are some genuinely sweet and moving touches (such as one Muppets' gift to Scrooge) that combine well with the trademark Muppet humor. Add to this good special effects, fine performances (both human and Muppet), and impressive sets and costumes, and you have a true classic: a film for every member of the family. In &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol,&quot; Brian Henson and his Muppets prove that, with imagination and skill, new life can be breathed into a favorite old story.with imagination and skill, new life can be breathed into a favorite old story.
B000000WF9|5.0|Although I only saw the movie a few days ago, I have been listening to the soundtrack for years...from the begining I was simply stunned, and it still continues to impress me today.
0767818040|5.0|This is Brian De Palma's magnum opus.   All of his other movies that I have seen have ranged from decent to awful.  This one stands alone as his one high-quality endeavor.<br />The film is very much like Hitchcock movies I watched as a kid.  The big difference, tho, is that it is spiced up.  Instead of being about either very wealthy or very ordinary people (as H movies usually dwell on), this flick centers around voyeurism, lewd fantasies and the dark underworld of pornography.   <br />The best feature of &quot;Body Double&quot; are the dreamlike voyeur scenes.  They are shot very nicely, and the music is both haunting and entrancing.  As an added bonus, the viewer is invited to spy Melanie Griffith's only nude scenes (at least that I know of).<br />The story is about a struggling actor, Jake Scully [played by Craig Wasson], who is booted from his house by his cheating wife.  To complicate matters, he loses his role in a low budget vampire movie because he is clausterphobic.  Mysteriously, if not miraculously, he comes across a man who is willing to let him house-sit one of the neatest, most lavish houses I've ever seen.  While there, poor Jake is drawn into a web of mystery and intrigue.  <br />Craig Wasson has been much maligned / criticized for his performance, but I really didn't think it was all that bad.  Wasson does not possess much of a screen-presence, but in this film that is actually a plus.  Jake Scully is a rather shy and mousey sort of fellow;  I could not imagine someone like Sean Connery pulling off a role like this (Connery has too much charsima and too commanding a screen presence).   To be fair to Wasson, there are plenty of far worse actors out there.   (Paging Keanu Reeves, Mr. Reeves, please report to the bad actor's guild).<br />If you like suspenseful / thriller movies with a touch of eroticism, &quot;Body Double&quot; just might be for you.   Just be forewarned:  this is certainly a weird movie.  Not that that's bad, of course.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park bursts onto the scene with lots of rock and lots of rap. This cd is one of the best cds I've heard for several years. Though some of you may think that Hybrid Theory changed their name to Linkin Park to end up next to Limp Bizkit, you're wrong. They are incredibly good and I would recommend this cd to all of my friends.<BR>Of my entire cd collection, including Staind, Gorillaz, Tool and most likely soon-to-be Adema and System Of A Down; I like Linkin Park the best. So go out there and buy it all of you!
B00005Q45W|5.0|After 9 years, some of it spent in a Zen monastery, he's back !<br />Back with an incredibly beautiful CD...smooth, slow and mellow. These songs are so quiet and understated, it's just short of listening to silence. The arrangements are simple, and done by Sharon Robinson, who also produced, programmed, and performed the music, co-wrote the songs, and who's very lovely voice is a complement to Cohen's, but kept mostly in the background, making for a perfect balance.<br />These are poetic and thoughtful songs to contemplate the mysteries of life by, or maybe just to sit and watch the grass grow by, which may be the same thing...it will definitely take its place up there with &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; as a favorite CD.<br />Welcome back Mr. Cohen, we missed you.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I was hooked on his music the first time I heard &quot;Suzanne&quot; on FM radio lo those many years ago and his new offering is on a par with anything he has ever done.  There are songwriters and there is Leonard Cohen.  I will always remmeber when I used to put his music on for my friends while we were growing up in the early 70s.  They would want to jump out the window.  &quot;He's so depressing,&quot; they'd say.  Nonsense.  His music is gorgeous and rich.  He writes the most beautiful and spiritutally honest songs of anyone alive.  &quot;In My Secret Life&quot; is an instant masterpiece.  There is much to commend this cd, which I just received about three days ago and have listened to nothing else since.  Perhaps one is not always in the mood for Leonard Cohen, but listening to his unique music and poetry is one of life's great joys.  The world is always a better place when there is a new Leonard Cohen disc to listen to day and night until the mood lifts and it's ok to settle for ordinary stuff again.
B000005AYM|5.0|Quite simply amazing. Subtle but perfectly pitched. I still can get on &amp; on and certainly (flipped it) out of my head and i haven't got round to hearing the whole album yet. Put this album in your collection and you wont be disapointed
B000001DZQ|5.0|This is a 2 cd anthology which compiles Roy Buchanan's Polgram output with a few tracks from Atlantic thrown in for good measure.  The time period represented is from 1969-78.  No tracks from his later Alligator output are included.  Roy Buchanan was from the excellent technique but weak singing line of white blues/rock/jazz guitar heroes which include Jeff Beck, Harvey Mandel and Mike Bloomfield.  Roy Buchanan was a master of many styles from rock to blues to jazz.  This compilation concentrates on his earlier output.  He gained recognition after being named as one of the best &quot;unknown&quot; guitarists alive in the early seventies.  He reportedly was being sought as a replacement in the &quot;Rolling Stones&quot; at one point.  However his alcohol problems eventually led to his downfall and eventual suicide. This compilation contains no less than 7 unissued tracks with an additional 2 tracks from an ultra rare live Japanese only release.  Roy Buchanan's guitar playing mostly resembles that of Jeff Beck among current guitarists.  Beck supposedly was influenced by Roy Buchanan's technically masterful guitar playing.  This set contains many live tracks which gave Buchanan more room to develop songs and solos.  Among his more famous cuts are &quot;The Messiah Will Come Again&quot;, and his version of Neil Young's &quot;Down By The River&quot;.  Buchanan is a weak singer and the better cuts are either fully or mostly instrumental or feature another vocalist.  Most of the music is blues or blues related.  However by the time of his later Atlantic material he become more jazz influenced.  Some of my favorite cuts include &quot;Tribute To Elmore James&quot;, and covers of Cannonball Adderley's &quot;Country Preacher&quot; and Booker T. &amp; the MGs &quot;Green Onions&quot; and &quot;Soul Dressing&quot;.  Perhaps the most revealing cut is unissued jaw dropping 12 minutes plus Buchanan solo &quot;Dual Soliloquy&quot;.  Buchanan solos in a vast array of styles and unleashes all his tricks.  A fitting coda to a tragic figure.  A few cuts I like were missed such as &quot;Roy's Bluz&quot;, &quot;Further On Up The Road&quot; and &quot;Filthy Teddy&quot;.  Most of the musicians who appear are relatively unknown,  however Charlie Daniels appears on a few of the earlier cuts while Steve Cropper and &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn from Booker T. &amp; the MGs appear on the cover of their &quot;Green Onions&quot; while jazz guitarist Ray Gomez appears on some of the later Atlantic recordings. I found this to be the best Roy Buchanan anthology available as it omits some of the weaker cuts.  I also recommend the single disc &quot;Guitar On Fire&quot; a single disc anthology of the currently out of print Atlantic Recordings and &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; which compiles his last recordings with a few unissed tracks added.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The marketers would be real smart if there's an option in the DVD which rearranges the movie's sequences in a chronological order.  This way, people in real life who suffer from short term memory loss will stop asking stupid questions.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Alright - think of this as a slightly biased review - since I am a DM fan. I like this CD. It took me a few runs to get into it, however that is the case with most of DM CDs. &quot;I feel loved&quot; is absolutely great club song, &quot;Freelove&quot; and &quot;When the body speaks&quot; are great ballads. The whole CD is amazing - because Depeche Mode once again took it to another level. David Gahan's vocals are best ever (I also went to their concert in Chicago this June, and I must confirm that Depeche Mode is still going strong). I think that musically this is their best CD yet - and it has become very popular in european and also american club scene. It is not a CD that gets played much on commercial radio stations, so beware - you're not getting a top 20 type of a CD... Then again since you came to this page looking for Depeche Mode, you already know that :)
B00003CX5P|5.0|My review is geared more toward the DVD itself than the movie.  I'll just state for the record that I've been a lifelong Star Wars fan since I saw The New Hope back in 1977 at the age of 11 and have been extremely loyal to the whole experience since.  The Phantom Menace may not have been the masterpiece of TESB but it was better than ROTJ even with Jake Lloyd's sometimes wooden acting.  I didn't even mind Jar Jar too much considering he was better than the annoying Ewoks of ROTJ which absolutely killed the movie for me in parts.  At least the Gungans were believable when fighting the Trade Federation army compared with....never mind, I'm not going to start explaining what went wrong with ROTJ (at least for me).  On to my review.<br />The 2-disk DVD for TPM is an absolutely joyful experience after waiting so long for any of the Star Wars films (let alone any Lucasfilm title) to come out on DVD.  Considering how much time, effort and care George Lucas puts into his projects, you just knew that this DVD would be something special to behold.  Beautiful little touches like the wonderfully animated menus (absolutely loved the Pit Droids on the 2nd disk) to the inclusion of every single trailer made for the film made this just a thrill.  The hour-long behind the scenes documentary was great, though I wished it had been longer (probably no length would have been long enough but that's beside the point).  The movie itself is an absolute vision to behold, finally in digital as it was meant to be seen.  The dual layering on this disk is flawless with absolutely no transition detected on my 4+ year old Toshiba DVD player (compared to flawed layering on The Matrix which pauses several times during the playback or T2 Special Edition which has a definite pause during the layer transition).  I have the Dolby 5 version and since I live in a shared-wall townhouse a DTS system pumped up is a luxury I can't indulge in so I don't care about the lack of DTS encoding for sound.  Besides,DTS encoding eats up disk space and most likely would have bumped some extra(s) due to space considerations.  From what I can tell with my system this disk is almost as close to flawless in encoding as possible, true blacks, no white bleed, beautiful Dolby layering, etc.  Truly a fantastic example of what DVD can display.<br />Since I only got the DVD last night I haven't had a chance to watch all of the extras but I have enjoyed pretty much everything.  Although I do like the deleted scenes included on the extras disk I wish that they could have been incorporated into a version of the full length film (in their entirety instead of the minor reintroductions of parts of the pod race and the air taxi).  I do wish MORE deleted scenes had been included, especially the one at the beginning on Naboo when Obi Wan was running from the STAP because of a shorted-out lightsaber and had to be saved by Qui-Gon.  Several others come to mind but that again is just me, I was happy enough to get a glimpse of some of the deleted footage.<br />Thank you George Lucas (and everyone else involved at Lucasfilm) for delivering a top-notch DVD and making my Phantom Menace experience a great one at home.  I look forward to the other Star Wars movies in the future, the Indiana Jones trilogy and Willow which comes out just before Christmas this year as more stunning examples of what the creative minds of Lucasfilm can come up with for us on the DVD front.
B0000214F2|1.0|It is a travesty that Amazon.com does not allow 0-stars as an option. Instead, I am saddled with the the false implication that I believe this movie deserves 1 star. <br />This movie is so bad I believe the Big Nurses of the world will be using it as a torture device in nursing homes on old guys that ask for more milk with their corn flakes. It's embarrassing that there are people out there that regard watching this movie as a turning point in their life. I watched it with a girl who was crying by the end of it. I, on the other hand, sat in utter mortification at the monstrosity I had just endured. All the respect I had for Robin Williams as a result of his standup career and the brilliant ALLADIN was utterly demolished by the sick abortion that is PATCH ADAMS. It's awfulness is on the scale of a complex multidimensional matrix, thus it would take an entire book to render a just accounting of its abuses of taste and common sense. Only a repressed sadist could derive meaningful pleasure out of experiencing this leviathan of putrescence.<br />Robin Williams' shameless smorgasborg of vomit-inducing cuteness and its fourth-quarter gambit of pretentious depth is an invaluable tool for anyone who wants to know of what a quintessentially terrible movie consists. Just because it was thought up in a brainstorming session doesn't mean a gag ought to be included in a movie. Every dollop of *fun* in this movie is an unfunny and tedious attempt to make the same sanctimonious point over and over: medicine is really about making people laugh, and anyone who doesn't believe that is the bad, bad enemy. Thus, the mentality celebrated in this movie is a mindset of total black and white; religious fanatics and zealots everywhere would feel right at home.<br />Consequently, not only is the Robin Williams shtick totally boring after about --oh-- two minutes (&quot;Look at me, I'm talking like John Wayne. Whee, aren't we having fun?&quot;), the pretentious sanctimony and ludicrous profundity of the &quot;plot&quot; is totally insulting. Gushing cheeze, drippingly sentimental music, and dramatically phlegmatic appeals of the right to act stupidly and dress tackily is celebrated *over and over and over and over*.
6305079811|5.0|Sometimes certain films end up being much better than they have any right to be. Flash Gordon is one of those films. It is, in fact, and I say this in mortal fear of being mocked and shunned by my peers, one of my all time favotite movies. I can watch this film endlessly, and every time I see it I walk around smiling for the rest of the day... it's just that kind of movie.<br />The cast, first and foremost, is excellent. They work wonders with the material they're given... admittedly this isn't Shakespeare, but it plays remarkably well, with very few cringe-worthy moments. Standout performances include Max Von Sydow as the astoundingly evil Ming, Peter Wyngarde as the almost equally evil Klytus, Brian Blessed as the leader of the Hawkmen, and Topol(?) as an eccentric Dr. Zarkov. Then, of course, there's the absolutely stunning Ornelia Muti as Ming's beautiful daughter Aura... she's wonderful to look at, and has an exotic accent to boot. When I saw this film in the theater as a wee lad, I had quite the childhood crush on Miss Muti... sigh. Anyway, all of the actors seem to be having a grand time with their roles, and it definitely shows.<br />With all due respect to the actors, however, I really think it's the brilliant soundtrack that makes Flash Gordon stand out most in my mind. Queen, near the peak of their popularity, provided a wonderful, throbbing, highly eccentric collection of songs and instrumental bits that fit the film perfectly. I badgered my poor mother to buy me the 8-track, in fact, and then proceeded to play it at every opportunity... a very patient woman, my mother. She probably still hears &quot;dumdumdumdumdumdumDUMDUM **FLASH!!** ah-AHH!...&quot; in her sleep. Sorry, mom.<br />The special effects are actually still pretty impressive, as well... bear in mind, however, that I have a soft spot for 1980's effects. I really miss the days when the answer to &quot;How'd they do that?&quot; wasn't always &quot;With computers.&quot; There's a certain mystery to these old effects, and I always respect the effort and creativity that went into making things happen with such limited technology. Sigh... Still, the film is very,very colorful, and there are a LOT of costumes, backgrounds, etc. Everything has a very shiny, surreal sort of look to it, in stark contrast to the realistic, worn-out look of the Star Wars films. It's pretty neat in its own way.<br />In the end, though, Flash Gordon is just plain entertaining. There's hardly ever a dull moment, and the film's almost 2 hour running time goes by in a flash (pun fully intended, with all apologies to the reader). You get a lot of action in those 2 hours... there are laser battles, lots of starships, hand to hand combat on a floating spike disk(?), catfights (in a harem, no less), flame-throwing rings, dominatrix henchladies, evil Space People, a surprising amount of implied sexuality, and the list goes on and on. Just put it in, turn off your brain, and for God's sake HAVE FUN!<br />On a side note, I have to say that the DVD release is a bit disappointing. The five star rating is strictly for the film itself, not for the disc. Although the video and audio quality is fine (easily the best version currently available), there is absolutely nothing in the way of extras. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Not even a trailer, for crying out loud. Here's hoping that someone, perhaps Anchor Bay (king of the cult classic), will have the good sense to release a Special Edition. I would love to see outtakes, trailers, making of bios, commentary, etc. This film certainly deserves better treatment than it's given here. <br />Still, this DVD is currently the best edition of Flash Gordon you're going to find (and it's WIDESCREEN!). Plus, it can be picked up pretty cheaply, if you can actually find it. I wholeheartedly recommend that you search it out, watch it over and over, and then join me in waiting patiently for a collector's edition to come along. Even with its shortcomings, Flash Gordon on DVDmost definitely deserves a spot in your collection. Just file it under &quot;Guilty Pleasures.&quot; :)
B00005NP04|5.0|Everytime I Hear Martina McBride She Blows Me away!! With all her hits on one wonderful album. My Favorite Song is When God-Fearin Women Get the Blues. It has aLOT of attidute in it. Another Favorite Independence Day The Song is amazing. IF you love Contry music or pop music get the Cd or there is No slap-dab a tellin what I'm gonna Do.
B000002TQV|5.0|...you're comparing it with OK Computer. I *BEG* you on the name of all that's holy and important to not trust someone who says this album is bad or even mediocre. This CD is absolutely a classic. There is not one unworthy song on this CD. It changed my outlook on modern music at the time.  I thought rock was dead, but Radiohead shot 500 gigagrams of caffeine into the old boy.  <br />Fake Plastic Trees is the pinnacle of beauty--it delves into forlorn relationships, and trying to be something you're not to make someone happy. It is simply the most beautiful song this side of Mozart.<br />Street Spirit is yet another one that your conscious will just get entangled with the guitar parts chiming throughout. It is gorgeous. \\"Immerse your soul in love.\\"  The guitar work and vocals are hypnotic.  <br />My Iron Lung, an ode to \\"Creep\\" has an eery octave guitar note thing going as the main riff, which is very catchy, and then it just breaks into the gates of hell for the chorus.<br />A very underrated song, \\"Black Star\\", has a great chiming guitar-chord riff and really strikes a chord with anyone who has been in a relationship with someone who has given up--whether it's on the relationship, or life.  I found this song to be a \\"sympathetic ear\\" in a rough patch in my life after a pretty tough relationship ended.  That's what I love about Radiohead's music--it's ability to touch and sympathize with my emotions--not to mention the all out rocking aspect of other songs. :)<br />Every other song is equally profound, beautiful, or rocking like no other rock you've heard. I think that this CD is empirically perfect (I know I'm going to far now, music is not objective, but I'm tryin' to make a point here!). [....]A CD so profound, so beautiful, so...HUMAN...I can't see someone (who is, of course, into rock/pop) not liking it.  Try out this CD if you want something brilliant...if you haven't already, OK Computer would be another excellent choice.
B00003CX5P|4.0|What's to complain about?  This DVD has just about everything: excellent picture quality, sound, and state-of-the art effects work.  The special feature disc is loaded with documentary material and deleted scenes.  Nevertheless, some of the acting is pretty bad (Jake Lloyd in particular), and the dialog is lame in spots.  Certainly these were gripes I had about the theatrical version, and I still went to see it twice!  The extra footage added to the DVD version does make it noticeably better.  I just hope George and the gang make an effort to rein in the more maudlin elements in Episode 2.<br />In my mind, the best &quot;Star Wars&quot; episode overall is &quot;The Empire Strikes Back (aka Episode V)&quot;, displaying excellent acting, visuals, and plot.  The cornball stuff took a back seat; it would be great to see at least one of the first three episodes come close to it.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Directed with flair, audacity and brilliance by Darren Aronofsky, and centered by a devastatingly fearless performance by Ellen Burstyn, this is the most savage and unblinking look at drug addiction, both legal &amp; illegal, ever put on film.  It is a hard, hard film that is easy to admire and difficult to love, which is probably why it was nominated for, but didn't win, many awards.<br />Aronofsky's direction is continually inventive and surprising, jarring us, shocking us, and shoving us into the psyche and guts of these people.  It is a tough trip.  The cinematography and editing is exceptional. The DVD surround soundtrack is especially effective.<br />The story of a Brooklyn housewife/widow becoming addicted to diet pills while her junkie son &amp; his friends self-destruct in their own ways, is a descent into the mouth of hell and no punches are pulled.  It is all too achingly real and sad.<br />Should be shown in every high school in America, and on Oprah for the stay-at-home pill poppers.  This is exceptional film making and brutally honest story-telling.  As I said, difficult to feel warm about a film like this, but a not-to-be-missed experience, if you're ready for a rough ride.

Un greatest hits de Bon Jovi bas enfin sur les pice que l,on veux vraiment entendre, ces vieux et inoubliable succe des anne 80 et 90.  En gros, une voix sensationnelle, melanger a un style de musique diversifier passant de bau slow cochon a des toune rock bien engendrer.

B00004Y9PP|3.0|&quot;Pitch Black&quot; is a good science fiction movie, but it's not great.  Greatness requires an originality that this movie just doesn't have, for the most part.<br />The special effects were first rate, especially the heat vision from Riddick's point of view.  The space scenes were also very well done.<br />Riddick is an interesting character, but they went too far with his redemption at the end of the film.  Holding hands with the girl?  The guy's supposed to be a stone killer, so it just doesn't fly.<br />&quot;Pitch Black&quot; tries very hard to be &quot;Aliens,&quot; but it doesn't measure up.  The raptors are suitably nasty.  I especially liked holding off on seeing them until almost halfway through the movie.  It racheted up the intesity level.  But they still lack the intelligence and/or cunning of most other memorable alien baddies, like the Predator or the Aliens.<br />There are too many holes for &quot;Pitch Black&quot; to make the jump from &quot;good&quot; to &quot;great.&quot;  Of course, I could just be peeved that they killed off &quot;Farscape&quot; babe Claudia Black so early.<br />This is an enjoyable movie, in and of itself.  But it's not great, and don't compare it to any great movies, or it'll come out looking worse.
B00005JKOV|5.0|No movie that I have ever seen contains such an overwhelming abundance of ideas.  Good ideas.  Penetrating ideas.  Ideas about life, reality, the meaning of existence, and lots and lots of ideas about dreams.  Linklater must have been a philosophy major at the University of Texas.  I say this partly because of the sheer abundance of philosophical explorations of a huge variety of topics, but the presence of actual University of Texas philosophers.  I spotted two with whom I am familiar (Louis Mackey, author of one of the best books on Kierkegaard and who portrayed the &quot;Old Anarchist&quot; in SLACKER, and Robert C. Solomon, a prolific publisher of books on a variety of philosophical topics).<br />But I don't mean to mislead someone and intimate that this is a movie that solely addresses the head, and not the imagination or the heart.  It does.  Visually, this is one of the most remarkable films I have ever seen.  Most individuals anticipating seeing the film are probably already aware that Linklater initially filmed live actors in the movie's scenes, and then collaborated with others in painting over the images to create a remarkable animated film.  The result is delightful.  Visually, the movie doesn't look like anything else ever made.  But the film isn't just gorgeous to look at and stimulating intellectually:  it is funny.  Nearly ever scene results in laughter, and interpenetrating nearly every discussion, no matter how serious, is humor.<br />Apart from the visual aspect of the film, WAKING LIFE bears a recognizable resemblance to SLACKER.  If you had seen SLACKER and then went to see this one without knowing who directed it, you would be identify both as the work of the same director within a few minutes.  In fact, one of the earliest scenes in the movie strongly echoes the first scene in SLACKER.  In that movie, a guy at a bus station (played by Linklater himself), catches a cab and begins talking to the cab driver about his dream life.  He explains his theory that dreams might be a window into an alternative reality, and tells him that in a different reality, he might have talked and gotten to know a woman he saw at the bus station.  WAKING LIFE begins with the main character exchanging glances with a woman at a bus station, then going to catch a cab (though he ends up with a ride from a very unusual individual), and then the rest of the movie is an essay on the nature of dreams.<br />Though SLACKER and WAKING LIFE are stylistically similar, in the end they are very different films.  While both are somewhat episodic, with little (as in WAKING LIFE) or no (SLACKER) plot to speak of, and while both appear to be set primarily in Austin, Texas (I spotted one scene that seemed to have been filmed along the River Walk in San Antonio and another on the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC), and both contain a succession of professional and amateur actors, WAKING LIFE differs in two major ways, apart from the visual.  First, WAKING LIFE, despite the variety of character, primarily focuses on the concerns of one young man.  Second, while episodic in structure, WAKING LIFE is structured by the constant questioning of the nature of waking reality versus dreaming reality.  SLACKER was basically about nothing; WAKING LIFE is definitely about something.<br />This movie is not for everyone.  If you don't like ideas and talking about ideas, you might find this film tedious.  It is animated, but it bears utterly no resemblance to a Disney movie.  And it really doesn't have much of a plot.  If you require a definite and involved plot, this movie won't be to your liking.  For those who love extraordinary visual imagery and brilliant conversation about ideas, this movie will be a rare treat.<br />Slight correction:  one character in the movie says that Kierkegaard's last words were:  &quot;Sweep me up.&quot;  This quote is, in fact, based on something Kierkegaard reputedly said a month or so before he died.  He was at a gathering at someone's house when he collapsed physically.  As people gathered around him, he quipped, &quot;Let it lie.  The maid will sweep it up in the morning.&quot;  He soon entered a hospital and died a month later, apparently of a staph infection.  I am not aware of any recorded final words.ouse when he collapsed physically.  As people gathered around him, he quipped, &quot;Let it lie.

B00005N9CV|3.0|OK, if you're a diehard Diana Krall fan, which I am, you're going to want this album just to complete the discography.  But, WHAT is going on here?  This album plays like an alternative to sleeping pills.  Where's the fire behind all the smoke we've come to love and expect?  Not here!  Although the arrangements continue to be right on target  and a perfect balance for Ms. Krall's  delivery, the biggest problem on this album, for me, is programming.  This is not a fatal misstep, but a misstep, nonetheless. This is programming  for the snooze channel: it's one soporific performance after another, so if you need to REALLY wind down, here's your album. As I listened, I just kept asking myself, &quot;Is that all there is&quot;?
B00005AFVR|4.0|...but not without some flaws.  First of all, a flawed Springsteen concert is still better than 99% of all concerts you will ever hear.  With that said, I will tell you what I loved: The incredibly powerful version of &quot;Youngstown&quot; with a memorable contribution from Lofgren, the unique presentation of &quot;Mansion On The Hill&quot; with a country flavor, a wonderful version of &quot;Lost In The Flood&quot; (although Weinburg's drumming seemed to slow the song down a bit), a nice acoustic version of &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot; where Springsteen's vocals and guitar playing are superb, &quot;Jungleland&quot; (incredible how the band can still do this song with so much heart), and a great live version of &quot;Ramrod&quot; that will raise the blood pressure a few notches.  Now the faults: The preaching segment in &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze Out&quot; is too long and ruins the song, this version of &quot;The River&quot; is not one of the best(I've heard many)- Springsteen seems to have trouble finding the proper range in his vocals to give this song a proper flow and harmony, &quot;Land Of Hopes and Dreams&quot; is a good song but runs a little too long (even for Springsteen), and finally the most troubling mistake on this cd is that it is recorded on the last night of a 12 night set in N.Y. after a tour that was over a year old.  Springsteen seemed exhausted at times and you could hear it in his voice.  If he wanted to do a live recording in N.Y., fine, but do it on the first night or wait a few days at the end.  I did notice the 6 additional tracks at the end had a better recording quality and Springsteen seemed more refreshed so these might be from earlier performances.  Anyway, overall this cd is still Springsteen and he's still the best so buy it and enjoy and then listen to &quot;Live 1975-85&quot; when Springsteen ruled the world!
B000002MIY|5.0|Want to listen to the best well here it is.A review doesn't justify class.
B0000029DD|5.0|Once you realize that Buckley died by drowning a year or so after releasing this album, his many allusions to water and death and long sleep will make you appreciate this man's angelic voice and powerful music all the more.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is one of the smartest comedies around today.  It's &quot;made&quot; for children, but so much of the humor is sure to fly right over kids' heads.  Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow are perfect for their character's voices.  Shrek is original and the computer technology is simply stunning.  The whole world was shocked at Disney/Pixar's collaborations on both Toy Story and its sequel, and A Bug's Life, but they in no way can compare with the special effects of Shrek.  I highly recommend this film for anyone, young and old.  The storyline's moral is brilliant, plus it adds a twist to &quot;the greatest fairy tale never told&quot;.
6302968135|5.0|I saw this film at USC in 1993 after a talk by the director, Taylor Hackford.  I do not normally like films like this much, but this was a powerful and moving film which was never slow despite it being quite long.<br />The cast were terrific and I assumed it was going to be a huge hit- I was very surprised that it wasn't.  The best 'gang' film I have seen.

0553565915|5.0|I've read a few books about life after death.  I found this book to be simply written and just a joy to read. It goes back and forth with what's going on in her life and then back to her visions and memories. As a believer in the afterlife I was enthralled by the beauty described and magical experiences. It proves that there are no coincidences in life.  One never knows what's coming next. Which makes the jouney of life even more exciting. Needless to say, I highly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in knowing about the afterlife. Keep an open mind and an open heart.
B00000ILDE|5.0|How much do I like this movie?  I went to see it in the theater twice!  I bought a laser disc player just to own the director's cut version that James Cameron put together!  If &quot;Alien&quot; was the haunted house movie in outer space, then &quot;Aliens&quot; is the war movie in outer space!  How good is this movie?  Well, you do not even see an alien for the first hour of the film and you are still on the edge of your seat!  Once the action starts it becomes non-stop at the end of this one!  Every time you think things cannot get worse, they get worse!  The exciting conclusion culminates in the unthinkable: hand-to-hand combat between Ripley and the Queen Alien!  Plus, one of the great &quot;hero laughging in the face of danger&quot; lines of all-time!  Great ensemble cast of space marines, at least until they get the crap knocked out of them!  And the special effects are mostly guys in alien suits and a whole lot of jump cuts!  Great action film!
6305014140|5.0|The story takes place in ancient Japan. A mysterious outbreak occurs in a nearby village and a team of ninja warriors are sent out to investigate. As the entire group is killed, except for one woman survivor it is then realized that there are evil forces at work. Jubei, our traveling hero finds himself trapped in the middle of this confrontation and must face the 7 demons of the dark.<br />What can I say Ninja Scroll was off da hook!!! For all those that didn't like NS pick up your toys and go back to watching your Pokemon. This is a real man's anime!<br />I loved every minute of NS. The animation, fight scenes, and the characters were awesome!! There wasn't a thing that I didn't like about the movie. Everything in NS flows smoothly. Near the end a lot of things are made clear. For example you learn why the ninja woman's beauty is considered a curse and why fate has pulled Jubei into this war. This movie is something that the hardcore adult anime fan can enjoy. If you like gore, a little nudity, and excellent fight scenes in your anime then this is the title for you!<br />I suggest Ninja Scroll for 17+ due to all the nudity and violence it contains. Ninja Scroll will be a classic throughout the ages and it's safe to say that it's one that I'll NEVER get tired of!!!
B00005ATZT|5.0|This has got to be the action drama of the decade.  Till today, I've yet to find a movie adapted from a TV series achieve the standard achieved by THE FUGITIVE.  The chemistry between the 2leads was truly amazing.  Kept me on the edge of the seat with its twists in the plot.  Guaranteed to keep you glued to your seat (or at least hit the PAUSE button while you're away) so as not to miss a second of the action.<br />Definitely the action drama of the 90's.  You'll definitely regret missing it!

B00000ILDF|3.0|&quot;Aliens&quot; was my favorite film in the series, so when they kill off Newt and Hicks in the opening credtis fo this one, I was very, very, very, ticked off!  So Ripley is now stranded on a penal colony, convinced the big bad aliens are about to start killing everyone!  The second-half of the film manages to redeem itself somewhat when we find out why the aliens have spared Ripley!  David Fincher's 1992 film is certainly the weakest film in the (so far) four films, although Signourney Weaver struggles valiantly with the script's shortcomings!

It is as fresh today as it was when I read it the first time about 30 years ago.<br />I am always struck by those who use Anne's quote about people really being good at heart. . .  According to Anne's friend, Lies Gosslar, Anne certainly didn't think people were good at heart after being imprisoned at Aushwitz and Bergen-Belsen.  Trying to put a happy face on the Holocaust or give it a positive spin is really more than I can stomach.

0060934719|5.0|With Stardust, Neil Gaiman gives us a modern recreation of the fairy tale of old - and thankfully shakes a good helping of dust from what is an undervalued genre. What we have here is a mixture of dark prose, bright humour, vivid imagery and Gaiman's own seemingly limitless imagination all woven together in a story which is fast-paced, often funny and utterly, utterly charming.<br />Imagine the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm (which often had darker elements to them). Imagine the quirky humour of Terry Pratchett. Imagine lines sharper than a fox's teeth. For goodness sake, don't imagine the sort of pre-packaged, sanitized fare you'd get from Disney. It has no place here.<br />Somehow Gaiman manages to rekindle the boundless imagination and wide-eyed innocence we felt in youth and marry it with the knowing, cynical eye of maturity. How does he do it? Ah! It must be magic...
B000002J09|5.0|If you're reading this, you have probably already scanned the track listing, glanced at the Amazon editorial review, and poured over some of the user comments.  In which case you should already have predicted that anything I have to say will take the form of bubbling praise for what has been widely acclaimed as THE essential classic rock album.<br />I don't consider myself a big fan of Led Zeppelin, but you don't have to be to appreciate the artistry and solid-brass rocks that these guys have.  If you distilled fifty years of blues, metal, and pop sensibility into one album, you'd probably get something that resembles &quot;Zoso.&quot;  While not one of my personal faves, this is just one of those records that will be in my CD player twenty years from now just because it's that good.  There is hardly a person I've met who doesn't recognize the signature wail of Robert Plant when &quot;Black Dog&quot; opens up the throttle: &quot;Hey, hey, mama said the way you move gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove...&quot;<br />&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; has been perched at the top of virtually every poll taken for the last thirty years, and whenever someone questions the position of John Bonham as one of rock's greatest drummers, we just point and say, &quot;When the Levee Breaks.&quot;  Even a Led Zeppelin has a tender side; witness &quot;Going to California,&quot; a lilting ballad of the flower power generation.  Fans of Tolkein will find pleasure in the Middle-Earth imagery of &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot; and &quot;Misty Mountain Hop.&quot;  Those who enjoy a balls-out riff-fest will hearken to &quot;Four Sticks&quot; and the aptly titled &quot;Rock and Roll.&quot;  The songs are as dependent on the interplay between guitarists Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones as they are on Bonham and Plant.  Jones provides a crisp yet subtle and fluid bass line over which Page dubs intricately designed chords and layered hooks.  Some may proclaim any one of the band members as the driving creative force behind Zeppelin, but most will recognize that the greatest bands are borne of the chemistry and contributions of all members.<br />Yes, buy this album.  I won't guarantee you'll love it, but I do guarantee that it'll still be in your CD player in another twenty years.  But then again, I'm sure you already guessed I was going to say that.

0440234743|4.0|I thought the book was excellent.  John Grisham did and excellent job of keeping the reader's attention.  He made twists and turns that wern't expected by the reader.  He gave an abudant amount of detail.  He described things so well that I could picture them in my mind as clear as day.  For example, when Nate was looking for Rachel the first time, he was is in a small plane in a storm.  John Grisham describes thunder hitting the plane by saying, \\"A thunderacp just above the Cessna stunned them, like a shotgun in a ... room, and it shook them to their bones.  Nate's eardrums practically burst.\\" (page 98).  When I read this I could almost feel the thunder as if I was actually there with them.  Grisham also made the book very believable.  The plot and the charcters in the story could have been something that happened to a family. With so many rich peole now-a-days, I wouldn't be surprised if this happened to one of them.

0812548094|5.0|I truly find it hard to believe that the negative comments for this book, are really talking about this book.  Stone of Tears is prehaps the best fantasy I have read thus far.  The vividness of this book has granted me an unlimited enjoyment.  The characters were down right likeable, and blievable.  Richard and Kahlan are greatly executed, and I honestly can't find a single fault with this book, or this author.  Mr. Goodkind is like known other, the world hasn't seen an author of his magnitude since Tolkein and Jules Verne.  Mr. Goodkind is a man of pure talent, which won't be contested prehaps many years from now.
B00005QIPH|4.0|...just very very solid. I think someone said that if they came from the midwest, they would have received a tenth of the hype, and that's probably true. It's 10:30 pm as I'm writing this in Minnesota, and right now I can step out of my door and see about a half dozen bands at least as good as the Strokes. I'm not saying that to be flippiant. And someone like Jack Logan could churn out Strokes-like songs, if he really really wanted to, in his sleep.<br />With that said, the Strokes more than hold their own. What drives this album for me is Nikolai Fraiture's bass work, who almost single handedly turns the title track from a very good to a superb song with his aggressive, almost lilting stylings. The drum work is also excellent througout. The weakest part of the album as a whole is the lyrics; servicable, but not quite lines I feel the need to recite from memory. This is the type of album to really enjoy, but not to use as a bookmark for the future shape of music.<br />If you liked this, to be completely partisan, you should really pick up Fiestas and Fiascos by (sadly broken up) Lifter Puller, the definitive album on the art of the binge, and for that matter Consumption by the Rank Strangers. And anything by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. See what I mean? The Strokes are in the thick of a very interesting crowd, but they're not standing out from the crowd in any significant way.
6305335745|1.0|An episode movie that starts out with a boy not being allowed to read a DC horror comic. Once that presentation is over the viewer gets to see a couple of the comics in reality. Some of them are actually quite good and some I just didn't care about. The first one was a pretty creepy ghost story called &quot;Fathers Day&quot; which was less then good(Ed Harris had a role in it). The second was more of a funny screwball piece about a farmer that finds a meteorite and if I'm not mistaken the farmer is played by Stephen King. After that we get to see Leslie Nielsen and Ted Danson and a couple of more actors playing around in something that is less then good.
B00004Y2QS|3.0|I consider myself a pretty hardcore Prince fan.  Musically the man is a genius, which he proves on this video.  As always, he puts on a hell of a show.  And, in this one he gets back to tearing up the guitar like few people can.  <BR>Then, why three stars?  Don't get me wrong, religion is a great thing to have, but I didn't get this video so I could have a tent revival in my living room.  Prince never struck me as the kind of person who followed orders, so I find it a bit absurd that he should be preaching now.  I still love the music, and I'm still awed by his work.  But, I have a slightly hard time combining the religious fanaticism I see here with the the man who trampled over every sexual boundary and taboo he could find.<BR>It's worth having for the music no matter what.  But, if you're not a particularly religious person, be forewarned, and be ready to fast forward.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|I believe that Angelina Jolie is the only actress that could pull off a video character.  She has the great range as an actress. The acting and scenery was equally great.  The story had a great connection.  The storyline really pulls you into the movie and the action.  The movie has some very funny moments and is fun to watch.
0805062971|5.0|I thought this bookw as GREAT it was completly better than the movie and fresh. Palahniuk's narrative style is a great esacpe from the real world. It allows you to exit your life and enter the life of tyler durden, marla, and of course Joe, jack, narrator whoever you want to call him. i recommend this along with his others
B00005QIPH|5.0|Sure, all the hype is pretty damn annoying, but more often than not, it's there for a reason. This album is one of the best of 2001, and I've been listening to it non-stop, unable to get the songs out of my head. The influences (Velvet Underground, Television, the Who) are there, but the riffs and hooks are so sharp that it hardly matters. Take this album for what it is--an excellent debut--and wait until the second or third album for the final word to be in. PS--great live show, too!
B00003CXMG|2.0|Because it got overwhelmingly good reviews, I had high hopes for this film - you can scarcely imagine a better target for knowing ridicule than the world of rock 'n' roll, and Cameron Crowe, having written for Rolling Stone, has the credentials to do this. And basing a film around the celebratedly outrageous Lester Bangs had to be a riot. Didn't it?<br />Apparently not. Almost Famous doesn't even hint at some of the outrageous things which actually were going on in the rock scene at the time. Bangs is portrayed not as a odorous, loudmouthed, romilar-addicted wild-eyed preacher-man of rock journalism, but as an eccentric, slightly cranky uncle.<br />What it boils down to it that this isn't a rock movie at all. It's a coming-of-age movie. It's about a 13 year old Cameron Crowe bluffing his way into writing for Rolling Stone. Now, that story *MIGHT* have been interesting if he'd decided to tell it straight - actually naming and shaming - but he doesn't. He wimps out by making up the characters and then double wimps out by making the characters dull. Stillwater - the fictional band at the heart of the action - are completely implausible as rock idols, having no streak of threat about them at all. They all wear brushed cotton shirts.<br />If you ignore the cop-out plot headline, what you're left with is some silly treacly stuff between mother and son (not even Frances McDormand can save this one, having been given a stinker of a part as a college lecturer and highly-strung mom) and a highly improbable, depressingly sanitised sub-plot about a sixteen year old groupie who doesn't *do* it.<br />Good one, Cameron.<br />If you want a coming-of-age movie, watch River Phoenix in Stand By Me. If you want a rock 'n' roll spoof, then there's still only one contender - This is Spinal Tap. But as for this minor turkey - if you see it on the shelf at the video store and think twice... keep walking.
B00000IP3S|5.0|This is yet another great work by Blind Guaridan.  This is the 4th album I have bought by them and I have yet to be disappointed.  All songs are amazing, and the non metal song Past and Future Secret is one of the best on the album.  A must buy for all melodic metal fans.
B00000K0DT|3.0|Given the strength of the cast, The Usual Suspects was a surprisingly down-beat and unambitious film. It was certainly watchable, but is a bit pointless - in announcing that the subject of proceedings is uncovering the identity of the mysterious Keyser Soze, it telegraphs the fact that There Will Be A Twist In The Ending And Keyser Will Turn Out To Be Someone You Didn't Expect (if there isn't, the film will just be plain dull), and unfortunately the twist is guessable after about three quarters of an hour, and all but inevitable by the time it arrives.<br />Could have been better.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have been putting off this review for quite some time now, and I fully realize that there is probably very little to add to the analysis of Radiohead's 'OK Computer'.  Especially since this is its 800th amazon review (!).<br />I have been putting this review off also because I have been trying to place it in the context of this band's musical development, especially since I was one of those who came upon 'Kid A' and later, 'Amnesiac' before 'OK Computer'.<br />Despite the so-called genre-busting style and texture of the latter two Radiohead releases, to these ears 'OK Computer' still stands as the Radiohead masterpiece.  It is no coincidence that this is by far the band's most inaccessible, difficult work.  Although 'The Bends' was an amazing jump in musical development for the band (and arguably its biggest leap, hugely overshadowing 'Pablo Honey' in both sophistication and depth), I would argue that 'OK Computer' may be similarly a huge jump over 'The Bends'.<br />Initially, I actually enjoyed 'The Bends' more, as it is a much more friendly, embraceable work as a whole.  That's not to say that it's not deep-- 'Street Spirit (Fade Out)' is as good as anything Radiohead has ever done in my humble opinion-- but from top-to-bottom, OK Computer wins as the best overall effort.<br />Something about 'The Bends' strikes me as just a wee-bit radio-friendly, and although they are delicately, sweetly deliciously listenable tunes, both 'High and Dry' and 'Fake Plastic Trees' are just a bit too easily grasped in my opinion.  There is beauty in simplicity, and while the band nailed so much of this beauty in 'The Bends', it does seem as though the band took it all to a new plateau on 'OK Computer'.<br />My vote for the two most mind-smashing songs of this one are 'Paranoid Android' and 'Karma Police'.  I don't think I've heard anything at all like 'Paranoid Android'.  It simply blew me away, and I had thought that I had heard it all.  For fans of classical music, I'm sure thatthe distinct, three-part movement of this epic song were not lost on you.  <br />'Karma Police', too, is very signature Radiohead in sound, tone, and sentiment.  I honestly don't know how these guys can keep coming up with so many musically brilliant, yet highly distinct and unique song movements and tunes.  <br />The only song that might even be remotely considered to be a throwaway 'filler' would be track #7, 'Fitter Happier'.  But even this cut-- which consists entirely of a computer generated voice monotonally delivering the mantra of 'fitter, happier' people-- makes its contribution to this album as a concept.  It may also serve to break up what might otherwise be perceived as a barrage of difficult-to-assimilate songs.  'Fitter Happier' serves as a nice break, almost evenly dividing 'OK Computer' in two halves.  <br />It appears that both 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' evolved from and seemingly do develop on some of the concepts and sounds introduced in 'OK Computer'.  I don't think that it would be fair to say that this record is somehow thusly more primitive that the other two, however.  True, it does not employ as much of the futuristic-sounding effects and overall ambient feel of their later work, but, in retrospect, we must put 'OK Computer' squarely in the middle of the evolution of the music of Radiohead, and thus also squarely in the middle of the revolution of Rock Music. <br />I am convinced that if people of the future have any taste in good music at all, Radiohead will go down as our generation's down-beat, anti-feel-good Beatles.  Their music is that brilliant.  As a music-lover, their influence on me has finally allowed me to re-embrace the rock music genre, and to re-approach the music I hear with a different set of ears and fresh new criteria.  <br />And so far, it doesn't get any more inaccessible yet ultimately rewarding than 'OK Computer'.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I think that this was an awesome album. It was definutly worth the 17 dollars i paid for it at Borders. The album presents the same feel as Kid A (The previous album that was recorded at the same time as amnesiac but realeased nearly a year earlier) but it a more warm and acoustic sound. I do not recommend the album to newbie radiohead fans. It is like all the songs that were too strange for the transition between OK computer and Kid A were recorded on amnesiac. that isnt necissarilly true for every song but i do think that it would scare a new fan away from the band. The fun begins with Pakt Like Sardines In a Crushed Tin Can wich starts with drummer, Phil Selway, banging on something like pots and pans followed by a vintage drum machine beat that fans of the song Idioteque will be happily familiar with. I Might Be wrong will please those who enjoyed the National Anthom on Kid A. After that the album is pretty original stylistically (that shouldnt surprise RH veterans).     I definitly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys radiohead.  I give it a 4 out of 5.
B00003CXXS|4.0|JP3 is nothing more than an action filled, edge of your seat, nail biting, heart pounding, jump out of your seat action thriller with `oh my god, do those Dinos look real' special effects.  With that said, why wouldn't anyone want to see this movie?  I can't think of one reason.  This movie was great.  It was such an improvement over the second one that I am now hoping they make a fourth one, and let Joe Johnston direct it, PLEASE!  I know that Spielberg was happy with what he saw. Which tells me one thing, Spielberg has outgrown these movies.  He's moved on to bigger things, like A.I. and Saving Private Ryan.  So let the reigns of his more meager works be taken over by lesser known talented directors.  Johnston does a superb job of handling the legacy of Jurassic Park.  He takes it back to the roots.  The movie is more of an action adventure.  It does tend to touch more on the themes of messing with nature and whether it is right or wrong as they did in the first one, but not as much.  Alan Grant, played very well again by Sam Neil, is hired to play aerial tour guide for a rich couple who want to see Isla Sorna from a plane.  A crash ensues and of course, people become snacks for the Dinos.  There are some cheesier themes of family togetherness as Grant finds out that his rich thrill seekers are really poor saps looking for their lost son on the island.  But the action that ensues from this is entertaining and pulse pounding.  There are many more types of dinosaurs to be seen, and the new big baddie, the Spinasauras is absolutely nasty.  the fight between him and the T-Rex is worth the cost of admission alone.  Improvements in Computer animation since the first movie allow us to see spectacular aerial shots of so many Dinos that you want to believe there is an Island out there with these creatures to be seen.  As I said beore, don't look for heavy themes of whether we should be tampering with nature as they did in the first movie, but you can count on something much more thrilling and fun to watch then the second movie.  Highly recommended.
B000002GGU|5.0|I dedicate the song Heaven to my husband Den.  I fell inlove with the song when I first heard it along time ago and I could never find it. But now I have. The song has all the right words that comes from the heart and it touches me every time I hear it. When I first heard the song when I was young, I always said that when I find my soul mate, my one and only true love, I would dedicate this song to him. Well I found my soul mate, my one and only true love in 1989 and I found the song that I have been wanting to dedicate to him.  I want to thank you for singing the song and touching my heart with it, it will always be #1 to me. Thanks
B00004TRD8|5.0|In the history of Sequels, very few seem to have the clout to match or surpass the original movie.  This is one of those movies that far surpasses its predecessor and breaks new ground once again.  The first one was stunning because of the smooth transitions between different mock ups of the Terminator robot, stop motion animation and close up shots.  Just as innovative were the make up effects on Arnold, showing a metal creature under the organic skin of the assassin.  Not to mention it's original story, great script, solid acting and genuine emotion.  In Terminator 2, James Cameron knew that if the villain in the first movie was a tank, then the new one had to be like a Porsche.  Streamlined, efficient and incredibly dangerous, with or without weapons.  It seems Cameron got to do what he had wanted to do in the first movie, create a Terminator who is an everyman.  Someone who could slip into crowds without standing out.  Robert Patrick gets the honor of being the bad guy in this movie, the T1000 Terminator.  His steely glare and psycho-tronic movements mimic what made Arnold so convincing in the first movie.  This is a hunter, a killing machine.  And we know that if he were to ever catch up to his target, he would destroy him immediately, no hesitation.  In this sequel (and who doesn't know the story) Arnold is sent back by John Conner to protect his younger self.  The unstoppable killing machine is now reprogrammed to keep a young boy alive, and at first, he's willing to kill anyone who may threaten him.  The young John Conner, played by newcomer Edward Furlong in this movie, stops him just in time.  Cameron ingeniously writes in a different angle on machines in this movie.  The first one seemed to focus on our reliance on machines and how it would eventually  turn against us.  Now, he is making a careful edict saying that we need to show our machines who is boss.  That they should do what we tell them to do.  But eventually, this machine can learn lessons as well.  Cameron obviously grew with this story, showing the possibilities of our ingenuity and what they can be capable of.  Ultimately, good or bad, it's going to be up to us.  Once again, Cameron breaks new ground with special effects.  The computer generated shape shifting of the T1000 Terminator was something never seen before on the big screen.  It made the character all that much more frightening, especially when you see that he can go toe-to-toe with Arnold.  One of the other impressive aspects of this movie is Linda Hamilton.  Her performance is top notch.  She worked out, studied weapons and martial arts and lost weight in order to become the single minded obsessed woman she is in this movie, 10 years after having her prophesized son.  She is not the same person she was in the first movie.  Sarah Conner has changed...severely.  My only complaint was that she changed so much, there didn't seem to be a trace of the innocence, or the personality of the girl in the first movie.  But that only seems to add to the character.  It makes her seem so distant, so lost, that we realize that she has a long way to go as a character as well.  Her obsession to get to her son and for him to stay alive simply for his purpose of becoming a great leader, over shadows her own motherly instincts to just care for her son in the present.  On the DVD, there is an added scene where Kyle Reece comes back in a dream sequence, it shows Sarah's yearning for him and how much she misses him.  It is one of the few scenes that show that she has not gone completely harsh.  Cameron always knows how to direct action sequences as well.  This movie is no different.  He balances the action with a story and makes sure the movie never loses sight of it's own humanity.  The 2 Disc DVD is packed with extra features and is well worth the money.  The added scenes are cool and tend to give a little more to what we really liked seeing.  There is so much stuff on this one that it will take a while to get through it all.<BR>Highly recommended, this movie deserves it's five stars.
B00000064G|5.0|This album is the most perfect 30 minutes you could buy.<BR>It is one whole suite not individual songs; each new song intensifying the last.<br />PINK MOON opens and comes as a warning &quot;its gonna get you all&quot;.  What follows are songs that capture emotions indescribable, Pure Blues.  HORN is minimal to say the least, single notes express thoughts clearly.<BR>The last 3 songs are my favorite, Drake's guitar playing is excellent on these.  I cannot imagine how it is just him playing one acoustic guitar and thats it.  There is so much more going on.  His finger picking and the tone that he gets from his guitar are almost impossible to replicate.  Combined with his voice and lyrical interplay its just brilliant.<br />Listening to this record is like a wiping clean all stresses and problems in your life.  Pure and Simple melodies to soothe your soul.
B000059ZIC|5.0|This is a very memorable album of Brahms Violin Sonatas. As a direct descent of Dvorak, Suk sure knows how to play Brahms, who was Dvorak's mentor. You can feel the polished glory of his sound in every note, and every phrase is played with just the right amount of burning passion and romantic nuance - the d minor sonata especially is a gem you wouldn't want to miss. The crisp Decca acoustics and the golden rich tone of Suk together create a very special atmosphere. Alongside this recording, I recommend the two Brahms trios Suk played with Janos Starker and Julius Katchen: it's the definitive romantic interpretation of those monumental works.
B00003CXB2|5.0|On making Lawrence, Mr. Lean knew that &quot;the thing that makes this a very exceptional picture are backgrounds and the &quot;uniqueness&quot; of the strange atmosphere put around the story. Audiences have seen good scenes and good characters before, but haven't seen what is shown in the first half of this picture&quot;.<BR>Wonderderful locations in Jordan had been left by Mr. Lean for the second half of the film, including Petra, with Lawrence ridind through it, the crossing of Sinai, and few others. <BR>But sadly, producers and others involved with the film decided to put an end to that, and as result we got this second half of the film with  &quot;wrong&quot; exteriors (Spain and Morocco), and viewers denied of being with the &quot;uniqueness of the strange atmosphere&quot; throughout the entire film.
B00005BCOK|4.0|Two friends are looking forward to a couple of nice weeks in the futuristic \\"Westworld\\", a recreation of the 1880s Wild West, served by human-like robots. But after a while, some of the robots start malfunctioning. One of them is the gunslinger robot played by Yul Brenner.  <br />The movie shows, like many robot movies, the danger in letting robots or computers take control. However, that's not the most important thing about this movie. Westworld is a very entertaining Sci-Fi thriller written and Directed by Michael Crichton. The story is quite similar to Jurassic Park, but Westworld is a better movie. I strongly recommend it to any fan of Science fiction or thriller movies, and maybe also to Western-fans.
B000001GXC|5.0|This is as fine a disc of Mendelssohn music as you are likely to find on the market today.  Three of his most engaging and consistently enjoyable works are programmed together here, with stunning results.  The Berlin players are in complete harmony with Karajan's vision of this music, and one wonders how these pieces could be played any other way.  This is really the Berlin Philharmonic at their peak of the Karajan days.  The recorded sound is excellent (if anything a bit too bright in spots), and the march at the end of the &quot;Scottish&quot; which highlights the brass sounds thrilling (Mendelssohn here echoing the finale of Beethoven's Seventh very successfully).  This is perhaps the finest &quot;Scottish&quot; on record in my opinion in its ability to involve the listener. The &quot;Italian&quot; is equally fine, though I have a personal preference for the former.  The only other coupling of the 3rd and 4th symphonies I am aware of that can compete with this disc is Herbert Blomstedt with the San Francisco Symphony on Decca.  To sum up, this is an essential disc.
B00005R2BG|5.0|This movie is on my top 5.  It has everything a movie lover could like.  Great music,dancing,drama,love,a story line,and beautiful sets. It is not at all what Mtv made it out to be,giving it a quality that sugests raunchy flauntness of body. If you love musicals, many kinds of music, and awsome dancing youll love this movie. The whole movie is an adventure of colors and sounds.  The beatiful settings make your come alive and you eyes dance. You fall in love with the tradgic love story of Satine and her young writer.  This is the best movie of the year. And one of the bests of all time!
B00003CXRM|5.0|George Clooney continues to make a name for himself as a brillian leading man in this beautifully and lovingly filmed \\"remake\\" of the Odyssey. John Goodman is used to good effect (as usual) by the Coen brothers, and John Turturro and all the other supporting characters are just as funny, and probably a little bit more subtle, than you're used to seeing from a comedy these days.<br />There are laughs throughout, and beautiful scenes. It's a nice juxtaposition of comedy and gorgeous filmmaking.
6305718954|1.0|Despite it's glossy visuals, production values and dependable performances by Gabriel Byrne and Patricia Arquette, Stigmata is an utter failure at it's core. At the basis of this overwrought dreck is a Catholic conspiracy revolving around a hidden gospel written by Jesus himself. A gospel that the church doesn't want anyone to know about. Their line of thought focuses on the belief that this testament would somehow challenge the basic tenants of Catholic faith. Most pointedly in the removal of a mid-point between man and god. Essentially saying that you wouldn't have to talk to god through the church and follow it's methods of repentance, (hail marys and whatnot). Unfortunately for the pretentious drivel that is Stigmata, there is a simple flaw that makes this film completely null and void. Apparently everyone involved in the production of Stigmata wasn't aware that all evolutions of protestant faith are already based on the iconoclastic tenant of a direct connection with god. Growing up a baptist I am well aware of it. I'm also aware that it's nothing new, and catholocism isn't any worse for wear because of it. Stigmata's intensely self involved delusion is, quite frankly, pathetic. That this film actually caused any ripples whatsoever in the Catholic community is beyond me.<BR>Beyond that more obvious failing, this film has loads more. Logic leaps and plot contrivances are par for the course. We also get to revel in and underlying cheapness. This is most apparent in the occasionl and utterly pointless nudity of Patricia Arquette. Not that she's not a pleasure to look at, but it doesn't serve any purpose other than a thrill. Neither do the over stylized and over loud effects. At one point she is possessed by some kind of demon who procedes to toss Byrne around, trashing the place. The only reason it happens is so they could have some sort of evil and menacing presence in all this mumbo jumbo. Once this film goes all Exorcist on us, (a film who's shoes Stigmata couldn't even shine), there's no saving this mind number.<BR>Yeck! Avoid like the plague.
6305165912|5.0|Who would have thought that a movie about bowlers would attain any level of cinematic greatness, much less perfection?<br />The Big Lebowski will do down in history as a classic film of our time period.  It's flawlessly executed, full of wit, wisdom, and beauty, and it's as timely as it is timeless.<br />I've seen this movie probably twenty times since its release, and it never bores or disappoints, and it never fails to get me laughing.  The Cohen brothers are the only folks out there who understand that the best use of John Goodman is as a dark character.  And Jeff Bridges is fantastic as a potsmoking, white russian drinking slacker from the mid eighties.<br />This is one movie that no film collection should be without.
B000059PPN|3.0|This film is one of Fulcis cruel films, which is crueler than his early films. It is brutal and has factors, which are hard goring. However, it cannot be explained. It happened that in a limited place which makes fear easily. It is a good creation of situation like this. It has many realistic brutal scenes but the plot is unreasonable and clumsy. It is not important in this film because this film just emphasizes a cruelty, which can stimulate curiosity to the audience. Before this film, there are good sound and visual effects, but this one is not better than previous works. Anyway, it is a good movie for people who like to watch the ruthless horror films.
B00003CXE7|5.0|We all know that the movie was great. Well, the DVD makes it greater! Excellent behind the scene footage and a log book written by the young actor. What a smart kid he is! (I actually read the whole thing) Made me wonder what it was like being a kid in Malta filming the year's best movie, rubbing elbows with Russell Crowe and Juaqin Pheonix!
B00000K0DV|3.0|This is a film of Lucio Fulci with New York setting. There are many cruel scenes as well as erotic scenes. In addition, Fulci, he plays a detective who chases the serial killer in this film. As most of his films, this film is also very cruel and brutal, but the framework of this is not so good. Clumsy acting and conversation, and just cruel scenes not interesting plot. This is the most shocking film of Fulcis, which I have ever seen. It is very ruthless, merciless and erotic. A duck voice killer, it is a peculiar creation of situation. Usually, Fulcis films use many sound and visual effects but the plot is not logical, just fallacious. The killing with no reason, pointless story line, but this film is attractive for the people who are interested in horror films, especially Italian ones. It is true that Lucio Fulci is a one of specific horror directors. Actually, it is much better than recently horror films, which are boring and tedious.
0792424573|5.0|I have read this every year for the past five years and love it. Mr. Jackson tell it like it is. He makes you smile and laugh. He makes you cry and scream. He starts with childhood and growing up in a big family and end right before &quot;Bad&quot; came out. He shares lessons he has learned and things he has gone through. This is a very personal book. He doesn't just write, he makes us feel as if we were there with him. Everyone should read this.
0805062971|5.0|I saw Fight Club opening night and I fell in love with the story!  It was intense, energetic, and blew my mind.  Well, so did the book.  I'm 16 and have the reading capabilities of a 10 year old so I rarely read anything, but I HAD to read it to get more out of the movie and I did.  The story was also a little different from the movie and it developed the charactors a little further.  If you enjoyed the movie, there's no reason you wouldn't like book.  It keeps that dim, dark story along with the fast-paced beat and funny dialog; it also seemed to me that many of Tyler's (Almost the main charactor for those of you that haven't seen the movie) sayings and philisophical points of views came straight from the book.  It had a lot of meaning to me and was very easy to read.
0380788624|5.0|Having read quite a few of Stephenson's works, I can say that this is one of his best. Though its size may detract a few of its readers, and occasionally it may seem like the side plots are dragging the main plot down, it is still a great work of fiction. It is set simultaneously in the future and the past with tenuous links between the two which gradually start becoming stronger as the novel moves forward. Expounding quite a bit on cryptography, and sometimes going into the mathematics behind it, it will appeal to everybody who is interested in math. In short, it is a novel worth reading and having in your bookshelf.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Possible one of the greatest trilogy of all time, this set takes the DVD experience to a differnt level.  The sound and picture are excellent and the movie just looks great.  As for the bonus material, I hope you have a few hours to waste, because this this is filled to the rim with bells and whistles.  My only knock is the The Godfather Part II, is on two discs, but considering the movie is 3 1/2 hours long it might be understandable, but I figured they could have jammed it onto one disc by dual layering.  Other than that small complaint this is a great box set and should be a must in anyone's DVD collection.
6303477259|5.0|I wish they would release this great concert on DVD. What are they waiting for??? I'll be one of the first to buy it if they ever do. It is not available in DVD format as of Oct 20 2001... Bummer! Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; is, but I really don't like it nearly as much.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Kylie Minogue delivers another set of dance floor ready gems. Standouts are the UK #1 &quot;Can't get you out of my head&quot;, &quot;In your eyes&quot;, &quot;Burning up&quot; and &quot;Come into my world&quot;. She looks and sounds incredible. Well worth the import cost.<br />Also, the Australian import version of this disc has a bonus track called &quot;Tightrope&quot; that SHOULD have been included on every version!
1587990717|5.0|This is a very playful and amusing book. I couldn't put it down. Anxiously awaiting the sequel.
B00005B36H|1.0|The only reason to buy this cd is for its booklet, it is the only good thing about Lateralus.  As for the songs, they are all a letdown.  The lyrical content drops from the previous albums greatly, and could have been written by anyone over the age of 7.  As for the music, what was once innovative has been traded for repetitiveness.  A prime example is schism, which is like 6 minutes of the same sorry guitar riff on repeat.  <BR>Tool peaked at aenima.

B00000AOUD|5.0|If AQUALUNG, which I have not personally heard, established Jethro Tull critically and commercially, this album cemented Jethro Tull as one of the few bands that successfully pulled off an intentionally grandiose concept album to such a high degree, and my belief is because THICK AS A BRICK is tempered with not only grandiose intentions but also parody elements which prevents this album from assuming a supposed artistic superiority or getting lofty to a fault.  The first (if not, one of the first) release that was a single song, Jethro Tull gives us an album that, had Pink Floyd made it, would be loaded down with pretensions and contains small sections written only advance a sketchy plot and, as a result, do not stand up that well musically (read THE WALL.  For the record, I'm a fan of THE WALL, ...  It just has some flaws).  Jethro Tull avoids those problems altogether by maintaining a no-nonsense approach and employs a jocular spirit to the proceedings that keep pretensions from getting in the way.  (For those looking for another album that does this, turn to DARK SIDE OF THE MOON by Pink Floyd, which is a pivotal concept album about the monotony of life but never seems to get bogged down with the faults of that other classic album, THE WALL.)<br />Anderson's musical muscles really get a workout on this release, with him handling various instruments as well as writing a \\"song\\" that has so many musical sections to make it a musical mini-opera.  As another reviewer pointed out, this does not have a traditional song structure, but rather floats by on Anderson's acoustic guitar or barrels ahead with all instruments full blast.  One of the true merits of this album is taking the myriad musical genres employed and making the seemingly incoherent mass into a seamless whole which flows.<br />The lyrics to THICK AS A BRICK, penned (according to the mock newspaper that comprises the album cover) by Gerald \\"Little Milton\\" Bostock, are as dense as anything that came out of the Beat movement.  Anderson is probably enacting a private literary fantasy by having one of his invented characters create such notoriety and lyrical ambiguity and complexity at such a young age.  Within the liner notes, there is a negative review of THICK AS A BRICK included, which helps tie Anderson into the \\"controversy\\" surrounding \\"Little Milton's\\" lyrics and, perhaps, helps him voice his own insecurities, which, masked as they are, never become apparent if they're real or not because he plays his cards so closely together .  For those who like a good riddle, Anderson gives even Dylan a run for his money which it comes to unlocking meaning to this vast assimilation to countless images which are carefully crafted and selected but precisely what they mean is anyone's guess, probably including Anderson himself.   <br />As a result, this record would become one of the premier albums of progressive rock.  Jethro Tull kept the album-length song in their bag of tricks for the following release, A PASSION PLAY, but that album's lasting stay or ability doesn't quite hold the allure, or accomplishment, or the remarkable playability that is THICK AS A BRICK.
0792839749|3.0|I recently replaced our old VHS of &quot;Chitty&quot; with this DVD -- boy, was I disappointed! Don't get me wrong, it's a great family film with catchy music, excellent production numbers and a lot of heart. But, why oh why, did they fail to give us the widescreen version? With &quot;pan and scan&quot; wonderful parts of the action are simply missing, and you know you are missing those things the director thought were important. OK, I admit I am a widescreen snob -- but with a DVD retailing for over $..., why not give us the whole movie, not just part?
B00005ASHM|5.0|As a reviewer I try to be rather conservative in my opinions to better aid the people considering buying said product, but I think easily PET SOUNDS is the most deserving five star rating I've handed out, ever.  Exaggerations and hyperbolas are the standard in Amazon reviews, but everything I say about this release is both an accurate description and a heartfelt love. <br />Originally a response to The Beatles' RUBBER SOUL, not only does PET SOUNDS proves Brian Wilson head and shoulders above even The Beatles (if only for one album), he quite beautifully  demonstrates what can be achieved by the human spirit.  Musically ceaselessly inventive, with layers and layers of all sorts of instruments and even a dog and a train.  However, music itself does not support the hype I've said about the album.<br />Here's what does: Brian Wilson's collaboration with Tony Asher, who wrote most of the lyrics for the album.  Asher easily proves himself an incredible lyricist and the best collaborator for Wilson's vision.  What makes PET SOUNDS so great is all the songs add to a cohesion of both emotion, spirituality, and searching for the answer that The Beatles never captured (and maintained) throughout an entire album, and only distantly felt (compared to this; in their own right, both albums I am about to cite are intense) in Radiohead's OK COMPUTER and Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.  <br />This is the genius of PET SOUNDS.  It captures a stage in which we evolve the most: youth.  Not only does it capture it, PET SOUNDS recreates this stage and makes it wonderfully relevant to our own lives, no matter how far from youth one is.  Brian Wilson and Tony Asher chart a young man's voyage through his youth.  In only 35 minutes, this musical journey becomes both real and tangible, becoming almost like a novel in its characters' complexity.  While it can be argued that this is only a collection of songs, that strips away much of the beauty and incredible vision that it took to make this album.  <br />Listening to PET SOUNDS is like watching your life unfold: going through romantic idealisation to crushing heartbreak, searching for God and your relation to Him, and a struggle to establish who you are and what you stand for.  <br />While the dominant motif is romance, you can take this as an allegory or analogy for anything a person truly loves and the trials and tribulations one will encounter in a pursuing this love.  This facet is also what makes PET SOUNDS so accomplished and beautiful: it captures the pain of love, whatever that love is, whether it be in romance, which PET SOUNDS chose as its dominant landscape, or any other true love which is accessible to humanity. <br />Every teenager should discover the truths on this album, for it will greatly aid him/her in their own love lives.  PET SOUNDS, because of the ascetic environment in which it responded too (music largely simple with all these impossible romantic dreams, ala &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand,&quot; etc), much of PET SOUNDS deals with romantic turmoil.  The opening track, &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&quot; shows the young man in a very simple, wholly naive belief about love and relations to the opposite sex.  Then Wilson and Asher gives us a study of this young man journeying from idealisation to crushing lost.  The unnamed &quot;I&quot; becomes so real by the end of PET SOUNDS that, listening to the album in its entirety, &quot;Caroline No&quot; is so painfully intense after watching him struggle through so many things in his own life.  Because of the incredible buildup, this is the single most powerful ending to any work of art, let alone music, that I have experienced.  <br />When I said &quot;study&quot;, one may think of a dry, academic approach that only deadens what you really have an interest in and truly love.  Have no fear.  When you listen to this, you are constantly connecting to this person (or persons, even) that PET SOUNDS deals with (the unnamed &quot;I&quot;).  Anyone who will truly allow themselves to be open to this will find much of their own probing of life here, and generally one cannot help but connect and identify with the young man in his quest for identity and a solution to life's ever-appearing questions.  <br />Before I end this review, to clear up my own viewpoint of Beatles records in relation to this, the three mid-period albums (RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER, and SGT. PEPPER), are some of the best albums ever made but simply cannot answer to PET SOUNDS, The Beach Boys only truly significant album.  RUBBER SOUL is brilliant but does not add up to any cohesiave whole as this does.  Wilson wanted to outdo The Beatles after hearing RUBBER SOUL, and in my opinion he did.  REVOLVER, one of rock's most celebrated LPs, again lacks the cohesion to that is required to top PET SOUNDS.  SGT. PEPPER, which, after Wilson heard it, felt crushed and defeated and left one of rock's most enduring &quot;What If?'s&quot; by abandoning SMILE, the follow up to PET SOUNDS which was never finished, let alone released.  While historically the most important LP we have, SGT. PEPPER is more an exercise in band psychology to truly stretch across and become the achievement PET SOUNDS is.  Paul McCartney allowed himself the luxury of pretending to be in Sgt. Pepper's band, and the only importance the &quot;concept&quot; of PEPPER had was freeing McCartney up and getting the band away from their bubble-gum identity.  While it has a tremendous closing, there is no magnificent buildup to what is an already powerful conclusion.<br />I consider PET SOUNDS, the one piece of art from music, that should enter the classical canon of twentieth century art.  Its importance and relevance to humanity cannot be overstated, and is one of art's best epiphanies and expression of human pain, searching, faith, and endurance.  <br />AS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS POSSIBLE!!!
0671024256|5.0|I found this book to be both inspiring and interesting, some thing not many other than the master of all authors could manage in one book! It covers not only his own experiances and his rise to number one best seller but alot of very useful tips on getting in on the writting world oneself.<BR>As an unyet unpublished author I found this book so helpful it is beyond words, he not only encouraged me but made me feel as if I had an audiance with the master himself!<BR>Alot of what is said struck a cord with me, the section on reading, how it feels to know I'm not the only person who carries a book with me every where incase the opportunity arises to read it! The rejection slips with the handwritten &quot;your style is very good but this subject matter isn't for us&quot; I get those too! It gives you hope that he went through the process and came out the other side, maybe I can too...<BR>Thank you Stephan King for sharing both proffessional and personal experiance with us in a bid to help all those who long to be published. <BR>Long live the King of horror may he continue to turn out the books we all love to be scared by!!! If this is a taste of his non fiction then I eagerly await his next, by far the best book I've read for months.
0800177177|4.0|....but a pity about the lack of special features. Nice ploy, though. Columbia Tristar must have realised that this is a favourite among many a viewer and decided to release this version first. We'll see another 'special edition' in a year or so. Trust me, wait a while.
B000000H3W|4.0|This album was Sepul's last thrash album and considered to be their best. Well, I prefer &quot;Beneath The Remains&quot; and &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;, cuz I'm in the minority. Not to say this sucks. No Sepultura album is horrible, except for the 2 Derek Green albums. &quot;Dead Embryonic Cells&quot; ranks in my top 5 Sepultura songs, but the rest isn't that great, but that is just me, of course.
B00003CXDU|5.0|Sometimes when I write a review and give five stars I pause. After all 5 stars makes a picture equal to THE GODFATHER or GONE WITH THE WIND, and BEN HUR etc. Thus when you have a light film such as GALAXY QUEST I think, &quot;Can I really make this movie equal to them?&quot;<br />The answer is easy: Most people don't watch movies for artistic merrits (Stop fainting you cultured ones) we watch it to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, in fact if you are not a SCIFI fan you will find it even funnier.<br />The plot is classic, every American knows somebody who goves a little overborad with their fandom (on any subject.) We joke about the actors who are typecast so we know this movie almost before we see it.<br />The characters are great, and the performances wonderful.  (This is the closest thing to a sympathetic role that Alan Rickman has ever had.) Sam Rockwell almost steals the show with some great lines:<BR> &quot;Didn't you even watch the show?&quot;<BR>They may seem harmless now but in a second the'll turn mean and they'll be thousands of em.&quot;<BR> &quot;I'm the crewman who always dies to show the problem is serious!&quot;<BR> Sigorney Weaver however has the best one, when confronted with something she has to do because it was on the show:<br /> &quot;Well I'm not doing it this episode was badly written.&quot;<br />You can't help but smile here.  Even the actors must have been tickled by that.  She is also a parody of herself in the big chace scene near the end as her front zipper gets lower and lower.  It is unclear if it is a parody of that situation on every Sci-Fi series or if it's just to show her clevage which is still attractive at age 50.<br />In the end Tim Allen and crew of course as humans always do adapt and succeed. It's a fun journey, that actually reminds me of Gilligan's Island, (which of course gets a plug here.) it that its a story of Americans who can make it anywhere.<br />Its clean, its fun and will bring you up, buy it and watchit.
B000021YQV|1.0|Only 2 1-star reviews and I don't totally agree w/ either one. WOW! I know a lot of hardcore metalheads love this album and are obsessed w/ it, BUT CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY?! &quot;Chop Suey&quot; has to be the most played out hard rock song that's on all the &quot;rock&quot; stations out there. I do enjoy listening to &quot;Prison Song&quot;, matter of fact I love that one, but the rest doesn't do it for me. Why? System Of A Down have progressed. Try and compare &quot;Needles&quot; and &quot;Psycho&quot; to tracks like &quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;War?&quot; from the 1st album. The heavy parts in these songs may be a bit heavier, but there are also mellow parts that turn me off.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Without a doubt the greatest rapper of all time's best album I bought this CD the day it came out and it waz the first CD i could actually play all the way through and likeing evrey song.  I think if evrey rapper could have an album this good rap would be a dominant music genere.  If you like rap at all this is the album to buy it definitley is the pinnacle of all rap music.
B00005LC1H|4.0|You can't go wrong with Fawlty Towers, but the directors' commentaries are almost unlistenable. It's not that the directors don't have interesting things to say - they do. However, the way they recorded the commentaries is distracting. You hear every heavy breath and clearing of throat, and there is no mix of the normal audio track with the commentary. WHY?
B00005MCX2|4.0|I heard the name Hawkwind years ago, and even knew that Lemmy of Motorhead fame was a member, but I never got round to buying an album by them, mostly because it's hard to tell what to buy: they all ave similar titles.<br />Although this one does not contain Silver machine, their &quot;hit record&quot; it does contain some serious heavy metal jamming. Less blues based than the Allman Brothers, less industrial than King Crimson, as spacy as Pink Floyd circa Meddle / DSotM and the heavy metal bass work that would fit heavy mateal bands (like Motorhead).<br />Very good to listen to in de dark (at night in your car).
0770428231|4.0|Other reviewers have used the word &quot;haunting&quot; to describe this novel, and I must agree.  This book stayed with me long after I finished it, and compelled me to read even when I was too tired to do so.  At first, I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.  Elaine, the protagonist,  does not come across as a strong character; indeed, she is almost painfully introspective and introverted.  Her inner life is rich, however, and her ruminations about her family and friends are quite perceptive.  So I kept reading and allowed Elaine to reveal herself to me.  As a girl, Elaine grows up in a family that is unusual, but loving and supportive of her.  Her &quot;friends&quot; are another story.  I don't think I've ever read anything that describes so well the cruelty that young girls are capable of.  The social and psychological aspects of growing up are no better shown than here.  However, this is the strongest part of the book.  Elaine's adult life, colored as it was by her past, is not as richly portrayed, but she remains an interesting person.  Her art is her catharsis, as personal and as difficult for an outsider to understand as is the artist herself.  This book is an eerie coming-of-age tale, told with poetic beauty and sorrow.
B00005MKA3|4.0|That's one of Marley's best albums. Almost entirely dedicated to Africa, it is about politics and, obviously, the faith in Jah Rastafari. All of the songs are very good, especially &quot;Zimbabwe&quot;, a joyful song for the conquered indipendence of that state, &quot;Survival&quot;, a song about the difficult life of lots of black people in the world, &quot;One drop&quot; and many more. Highly recommended.
0061040967|4.0|This was something of a surprise to me. I knew that Pratchett was beginning to get bored of the Discworld novels, but there was little way that he could just drop them; I expected some sort of departure for the series, but this was a little more radical than i expected. It's fantastic though- a shorter, but just as impactful, storyline, backed up by some of the most amazing fantasy artwork I have ever seen, almost remeniscent of the original, hardback version of Eric. Inevitably, however, this is a supliment to the canon, but not a replacement to the old-fashioned novels. An excellent one-off, and hopefully someday a collector's item, but I hope this will not be what the future holds for the Disc.
B000024F2G|5.0|If there is only one Bon Jovi Cd to own this is it!!!!  I wasn't a major Jovi fan before listening to Crossroad, but after a friend of mine lent it too me I HAD to own it myself.  I play it everywhere, in the car, at work, at the gym.  It has a perfect balance of classic Bon Jovi rock and famous Jovi love songs.  A beyond amazing combination of Jovi's best songs!  I can't express in words how much I LOVE this cd!!!!!!  This is a must have for anyone who calls themselves Bon Jovi fans!!!  If you're not a fan of Bon Jovi, you will be after listening to this album!!!

B000001IPL|5.0|This disc is AWESOME. The offspring at their best.  Every single song is great. For those of you who dont think the Offspring classify as 'punk' listen to Smash or It'll Be A Long Time. I listen to this album almost every day, it always makes me really angry...pure energy. Get it, you will not be sorry.
B000002KDO|5.0|First off, I had to replace the lp once because I wore the grooves off the first copy I owned.  What a tremendous recording.  Every single cut is fantastic.  From the first Cough in Sweet Leaf to the final reverb in Into The Void, there is a certain air within it.  The overall production of the album is great.  Their sound was really together.  They all shine on their performances.My favorite is Into The Void.  It is a very visual song.I use this album to warm up the fingers in my bass playing; in fact, this album helped inspire me to play.
0767849493|5.0|Here's the story of two fallen angels who have a plan to get back into Heaven, and the last descendent of Jesus Christ is chosen to stop them.<br />I think that this movie is subtly brilliant. I might get slapped for saying this, but there are many profound things said in this movie that make the silly plot worth it. It is a very entertaining movie. But more than that, the script itself is very, very good. It is no way insulting to the Church, rather, it just challenges how we see things. It provides different ideas of how things could have been like for Jesus, and I think that it confronts a lot of hypocrisy that has given Christianity a bad rep.
B000002KIT|5.0|...from a band that disappeared long before its time. The riffs, the songs, the talent, the sheer energy of this magnificantly engineered LIVE album - awesome! Lynott is a legend in Irish rock music and when you hear this album you'll understand why. Your only regret will be that you didn't buy it sooner.<br />Buy it today. Listen to it forever!
B00003CX8I|4.0|This is a really good action movie.  While there are traces of romance, it does not contaminate the real point of the movie: to entertain.  The visual effects looked realistic enough, and it was great to see &quot;non-mainstream&quot; actors in the cast.  Obviously the good guys win, but it is a pleasure to see how.  This is a movie I could watch over and over again.
B00005OB0A|4.0|Well, what can I say, she is incredible.  Not really being the type to like her style of music, she pulls it off well (trying to convence me).  This album is stupendous, hell more than stupendous, no word can really discribe it.  Fever has indeed set a new example for Kylie.  Light Years was great, as well as this, she doesn't know how to stop her audience.
0425180638|5.0|After the dissapointing &quot;Black Notice&quot; I was initially annoyed that this book continued the story, but Cornwell manages to make this one of her better books.  It also suggests more to come in the Kay Scarpetta series as it throws up questions over Scarpetta future which fans will be waiting to have answered.  A thouroughly enjoyable read which leaves you wanting more.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is a very cool cd, its got a lot of heavy guitar riffs, which turn out to be pretty enjoyable. There songs may be similar but there songs are also very awesome so who wouldn't want a lot of some cool songs? I havent listened to &quot;State&quot; so I can't make any comparisons to it except for &quot;Leader Of Men&quot; which i think that a lot of the songs are actually better on Silver Side Up than &quot;Leader Of Men&quot;, which is saying a lot. So I believe that this is a must for any heavier rock listener.
B000050XEI|4.0|Over the years, Enya has become a master at her craft, producing wonderful moving song after wonderful moving song.  Personally however, I find it a little difficult to listen to this whole album at once.  After a while the synthesized voices tend to become a bit tiring.  This album is also not drastically different from her previous works.  I will say though that Enya's instrumental pieces are brilliant.  &quot;A day without rain&quot; is a wonderful example of this.  I think the songs that stand out the most are &quot;tempus vernum&quot; and &quot;fallen ember&quot;.  The former produces harmonies that are seemingly relatively new to Enya (and heck, the lyrics in latin make it a much stronger work than it would have been if it had been done in English) and the latter, &quot;fallen ember&quot; is one of the few pieces I've heard that really showcases Enya's angelic voice, without any distractions caused by synthesized &quot;ahhs&quot;.  <br />This CD is great to listen to if you want to relax, and, while it may be similar to Enya's previous fare, it is different enough to please hardcore fans and casual listeners alike.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved to see this movie.  This is Eddie Murphy's funniest movie.  I want to see it again & again & again.  I would recomend this to anyone.  My aunt actually laughed.  This probably can make anyone laugh out loud.  My favorite chacter is the donkey.  You might not agree with me but that's ok.  There is a very cool suprise at the end.  I won't tell u.  The main plot is for Shrek (Mike Meyers) and the donkey (Eddie Murphy) to rescue the princess (Cameran Diaz.)
B00004Z459|5.0|N'sync has done it again. In this amazing follow up to celebrity(i know they made this album so fast!) justin uses his great screaming ability to scream those powerfully moving words &quot;shut up when i'm talking to you&quot; in the breathtaking masterpiese ONE STEP CLOSER. Joey also uses his amazing rap ability in a song about seeing beautiful purple hills while getting high(or wait maybe that was eminem) but who cares he is still cool, and that song is so inspirational 2 me and my homies!!!! I love u guys NSYNC!!!!! THanks 4 the great album.
B00005LC6Z|5.0|I truely believe Halloween 2 is the perfect sequal compared to any sequal ever made.  The director did such an excelent job continuing the plot off from the same night, considering part 2 was made two years after the fist film.  Everything down to the television and radio reports were so detailed and accurate.  I also enjoyed them taking a step forward with the bloody special effects.  Halloween 2 is undoubtedly more suspenceful and pulse quickining than it's predecessor was.
630280082X|4.0|This was an excellent portrayal of how desparate people make foolish decisions and how good always conquers evil.  Macchio's performance in this movie was uncanny.  The guitar duel in the end was incredible.  If you enjoy listening to blues music or even if you don't, you'll be captivated by the performing tallents of all the musicians here.  This is a must-see so before this movie becomes a lost archive, I recommend checking it out.
0452281881|5.0|E is an amazingly funny book.  I first got the book at London-Heathrow on my way back to the states over the summer.  I figured I just needed something to read over the 6+ hour flight, and a book comprised entirely of inter-office emails sounded clever.  I started reading the book before take-off, and by the time we grounded in LaGuardia, I had finished and was truly amazed.  Beaumont's capability to carry a book soley on the power of the electronically-written word amazed me.  The book is filled with characters both colorful and lacking in hue, friendly and two-faced, neurotic and scatterbrained.  Beaumont manages to weave a tangled web of social scandals, technical difficulties, and a different brand of office &quot;interface.&quot;  E is a must-read for anyone who doubts that the British can be funny. I did, and now, in the words of Davy Jones, &quot;I'm A Believer.&quot;
0783208227|4.0|Heart and Souls is a simple story of &quot;the great beyond&quot; and the posablity that crossing over may not be some great leap,but only a short step.The cast is very good and they play well off each other.It`s a fun watch.
B00003CX5P|5.0|If I knew the DVD would've been this good I would've waited for it and not gone and rushed to get it when it came out on VHS. The extra features are so numerous it takes your breath away. I spent such a long time exploring it all and playing with it. There are so many extra features you could write a book. My favorite feature was the deleted scenes. It was SO much fun. Actually most of the deleted scenes were added on the dvd version of the movie except for a few. The only thing I didn't like about the movie itself was Jake Lloyd the actor who played Anakin. I know he needed to have similar features to Luke Skywalker but I think they could've found a better actor. His facial expressions never cahnged. He had the same expression on his face when he was happy, sad, scared, or bored. But after all he was 9 or younger when they started filming so I guess I shouldn't be to hard on him. Despite that I still give it 5 stars. I'm going to wait for Episode II to come out on DVD and skip the VHS version. If I absolutly can't wait I'll just rent it. George Lucas, if you read this, please don't wait to bring 4-6 out on DVD until after number 3 is out. That would be horrible. Actually I doubt us fans will allow that to happen. Anyways PLEASE bring them out on DVD soon!!!
0812550706|4.0|On one level, Ender's Game functions as a straightforward SF 'interstellar war' yarn, of your basic Earth vs. Insects variety.  On this level, the book is certainly a pleasing read.  But much of the book's merit derives from its thematic underpinnings: as much as it is about interstellar war, the book is also about childhood, pedagogy, technology, simulation, strategy, ethics, and, perhaps primarily, empathy.  The interplay of these themes suffuse the book with a certain richness, and yet do not slow down the forward motion of the plot.<br />Fast-paced, interesting, engaging, and smart.  Not a difficult read: there is little in the language or plot that would pose much trouble to a precocious middle schooler, and yet the book's moral positioning is nuanced enough to engage (and needle) any thoughtful adult reader.  All in all, an enjoyable work, and a solid illustration of the old adage that SF is a &quot;literature of ideas.&quot;
B0000047CX|5.0|Gotta say.  I love jazz but am not very familiar with its inner-workings and disections.  However, I played this CD last weekend for a girl i'm dating and it set the mood perfectly.  It adds so much mood and texture to the moment: the voices match the slow mellow horns wonderfully, it glows with a sense of humaness essential to making one feel comfortable and in the moment...and before the night was over it produced the desired effect.  You know what i'm talkin' bout peoples...get this CD and it will croon that girl of yours right where you want her.<br />=)
0893860220|5.0|Nisargadatta Maharaj's &#34;I AM THAT&#34; is the last spiritual book you'll ever need to read. Congratulations, you've reached the end of your search! Nisargadatta's words are alive and will cut like a razor to the core of your being. Get this book! Read it and be devoured by it. Here are a few quotes...  Nothing can trouble you but your own imagination. (I AM THAT p.113)  General knowledge develops the mind, no doubt. But if you are going to spend your life in amassing knowledge, you build a wall round yourself. To go beyond the mind, a well-furnished mind is not needed. (p50)  The window is the absence of the wall, and it gives air and light because it is empty. Be empty of al mental content, of all imagination and effort, and the very absence of obstacles will cause reality to rush in. (p260)  Leave it all behind you. Forget it. Go forth, unburdened with ideas and beliefs. Abandon all verbal structures, all relative truth, all tangible objectives. (p340)  All are mere words, of what use are they to you? You are entangled in the web of verbal definitions and formulations. Go beyond your concepts and ideas; in the silence of desire and thought the truth is found. (p295)  Too much analysis leads you nowhere. There is in you the core of being which is beyond analysis, beyond the mind. You can know it in action only. The legitimate function of the mind is to tell you what is not. But if you want possitive knowledge, you must go beyond the mind. (p341)  Before you can know anything directly, non-verbally, you must know the knower. So far, you took the mind for the knower, but it is not so. The mind clogs you up with images and ideas, which leave scars in memory. You take remembering to be knowledge. True knowledge is ever fresh, new, unexpected. It wells up from within. When you know what you are, you also are what you know. Between knowing and being there is no gap. (p520)  Consciousness, being a product of conditions and circumstances, depends on them and changes along with them. What is independent, uncreated, timeless and changeless and yet ever new and fresh is beyond the mind. When the mind thinks of it, the mind dissolves and only happiness remains. (p488)  [With self-awareness] you grow more intelligent. In awareness you learn, in self-awareness you learn about yourself. Of course, you can only learn what you are not. To know what you are, you must go beyond the mind. Awareness is the point at which the mind reaches out beyond itself into reality. In awareness you seek not what pleases, but what is true.

B00005QIPH|3.0|hype schmype - this reminds me of a few years ago when a band called jonathan fire eater was supposed to be the next big thing and they quickly disappeared. the strokes also have the same problem, too cool for their own good. the strokes are a decent band, but they are nothing new. lyrics are a bit better than what's on the radio - but the music itself is rehashed iggy pop and lou reed. if you want good rock, try built to spill or sunny day real estate or superchunk. there is plenty of good rock bands out there - the problem is that not all of them want to be rock stars so the media won't pick up on them.
080017948X|3.0|The repeating time loop, in which one experiences the same period of time indefinitely, is a familiar concept to science-fiction fans.  It provides fertile ground for a romantic comedy as well.  Bill Murray is a self-important weatherman who finds himself reliving Groundhog Day.  He goes through a number of stages, from disbelief through near-insanity to a calm acceptance, growing as a person along the way.  As much as I liked the concept and Bill Murray's performance, I found myself growing bored toward the end of the film.  Of course, repetition is unavoidable in a film of this type.  Indeed, it is the whole point of the movie.  Nevertheless, the filmmakers needed to make the repetition seem a little less...well, repetitious.  I still give it three stars, but screenwriter Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis needed to find more for the actors to do.

B00005K3OT|2.0|I recently read and thoroughly enjoyed Joanne Harris's novel Chocolat.  I thought that viewing the film version would be a way to share this wonderful, rich story with my boyfriend, but I was sorely disappointed!  <br />     I realize that when a film version of a novel is made, there always have to be some changes.  Yet it is possible to stay true to the novel's characters, plot, themes, etc. in the film.  This was not the case with the film version of Chocolat.  I don't want to give away too much...but significant changes are especially noticable in the central characters, Vianne and Reynaud.  The ending of the movie is almost totally different as well.  Be warned - Chocolat has practically become a different story!  <br />     Overall, the characters and plot just did not seem developed enough to make this a satisfying movie.  I would highly recommend reading the novel instead!
0395645662|5.0|I thought \\"The Giver\\" by Luis Lowry was a good book.  It's about a place where there is no pain, joy, or any other feelings and your whole life is decided for you.  There is a boy named Jonas that gets chosen at the age of 12 to be the receiver of all the memories.  But when he receives the memories he decides he doesn't like it doesn't want to live there anymore.  So he tries to find a way to escape into the real world but its never been done before where he lives.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I am a teenage girl, and I would like to say that britney spears insults me to the core.<br />why is it insulting you ask?  britney has said nothing in her limited lyrical content that hasn't already been said multiple times before.  she doesn't curse.  she doesn't come off like a suicidal cutter.  she's parentally-friendly.  <br />what's insulting about this album is all of the things that people have admitted to liking about it.  they admit that it is &quot;bubble gum&quot; pop.  they admit that britney lip syncs.  they admit that 99% of her sucess is attributed to her image and a good studio producer, and yet none of this seems to bother them, because the music is &quot;catchy.&quot;<br />this is not music.<br />music is playing to a crowd outside when it's raining.  music can be performed with as much power acoustically as it can in a studio.  music is someone living through something and writing it down and singing it with the pain of memory.  <br />music is not a bunch of guys in expensive suits sitting down to write a song that's catchy enough for britney to dance to and make lots of money.<br />and that's the bottom line folks.  your money.<br />when you buy her CDs, you are saying that everything britney stands for is O.K. congratulations for becoming another mindless member of society.  you have just sold out.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock was the master of Cinema's Rule One: 'Do not tell. SHOW.' Director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan takes that philosophy a step further in this film noir masterpiece by controlling not only the viewer's visual sense but their perception of time as well, reconstructing the protagonist's attempts to make sense of his world by reading the clues he leaves for himself (and us) and deciding who to trust in order to understand not only what occurs, but why. In effect, Nolan has rewritten the rule: 'Do not show. EXPERIENCE.'<br /><br />The cast is exceptional, Guy Pearce in particular, and traditional film noir elements are executed very well, with haunting music, taut cinematography, smart dialogue, effective voiceover, and a constant search for motive. Humor is used sparingly and effectively. This is really an editor's film, and Dody Dorn deserves an Oscar nomination for editing this gem.<br /><br />As for the DVD edition, it is a mixed bag. Though operationally a bit buggy, cinematically and artistically the special features are creative and fun. For instance, interesting scenes run behind the menus, and many film clips appear framed as Polaroid camera shots, both fun to watch and relevant to the film's concept. The original idea for the film was supplied by the director's brother Jonathan, who wrote a short story based on the same idea and designed the film's web site; information rendered from outside the time frame of the film, viewable on the DVD as newspaper clippings and notes by Guy Pearce's Leonard, are adapted from that web site. Also included are Jonathan Nolan's short story, an Independent Film Channel interview with Christopher Nolan, trailers from Memento and an earlier Nolan film, cast and director biographies, subtitles in English or Spanish, and a tattoo gallery (which looked interesting, but I couldn't get it to work on my Power Mac G4).  I wish more DVDs would incorporate this kind of material.<br /><br />I was disappointed because I'd heard that on the DVD you could watch the film as if it was shot running forward but that is not here, unless you count running the chapters in reverse from the Chapter Selection feature. I would also have liked to have seen behind-the-scenes footage, especially storyboards.<br /><br />This is a great film to watch with a group (as long as they don't talk during the film) so you can talk about it afterward. Nolan and crew can be proud of this fine film. The DVD extras could have been better, but they are still fun to play with.watch the film as if it was shot running forward but that is not here, unless you count running the chapters in reverse from the Chapter Selection feature.

6304346107|5.0|I saw the Paltrow &quot;Emma&quot; and thought it was quite good, but the Kate Beckinsale/Mark Strong version has it beat by a mile.  The casting is superb. The sets/direction, just wonderful.
0140135154|5.0|thirty years on, 'Ways of Seeing' continues to be a major primary textbook, not just for those studying or interested in fine art, but in any of the humanities from literature to cinema.  You can see the appeal for lecturers - difficult but essential theorists such as Benjamin and Barthes are explained with bite-size lucidity, even if this sometimes has the effect of caricaturing their work.  As Geoff Dyer has noted, much of the impetus given to Cultural Studies, the critical/academic form of post-modernism, can be traced to Berger's TV series and this book: many of the questions raised and areas for study pinponted have generated a whole academic industry.<br />In seven chapters, Berger assaults the traditional bastions of art 'appreciation', with its obfuscating jargon, elitist interests and, most damagingly, its insistence on timeless, non-'historical' values.  three of these essays are text-free, image-based, and Berger claims all the essays can be read independently and in any order, as part of the process of 'deconstructing' the apparatus of art criticism that includes laying bare the mechanics, manipulations and limitations of his arguments, and undermining the very idea of coherent authorship by suggesting the name 'John Berger' signifies a five-piece collective.<br />contrary to Berger's claim, the image-essays can only be properly understood in connection with the textual ones.  these are four now-classic pieces of critical iconoclasm.  the first synopsises Benjamin's famous essay 'the Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction', and discusses how art, and the culture it embodies, has lost its old rarefied authority in a demystifying age of image overload.  chapter three analyses the classic tradition of nude paintings, and the misogynistic/patriarchal worldview it upheld.  A related chapter, five, shows how oil painting, far from ennobling the viewer's soul, was used to celebrate and confirm property, unequal social relations, even slavery.  The final chapter discusses the legacy of this tradition in modern advertising and publicity.<br />Most of Berger's ideas hold up remarkably well three decades later, sturdy enough not to need the linguistic acrobatics of his successors.  As is appropriate, though, for a book pleading the return of history to the criticism or art, 'Ways of Seeing' is itself an historical document.  Not just in the sense of a pioneer work being a little dated in its language, a little exposed in its own ideological assumptions.  unlike his followers, Berger still seems to love some art, even if his 'exceptions' seem to lack method.  Some of his very personal discussions about 'love-making' strike me as being a bit embarrassing, but I'm probably repressed.  His Marxist beliefs might have been expected to be the most obsolete element of the book, but the clarity and passion of his ideas are refreshing in these ideologically compromised times.  <br />No, what I mean is, when Berger wrote this book, he was very much the rebellious outsider kicking against the cultural institutions and assumptions propping up various social inequalities.  While politically little has changed, the culture industry has been made over in Berger's image.  Every work of criticism on literature, cinema, art, even history is now shaped in some way by the ideas formulated here.  it is ironic and sad that a book dedicated to opening minds and new ways of seeing (and thinking), should have merely replaced one monolithic worldview with another.
B000003S0P|4.0|Yes, I'm asking, cause Fripp (as he always does), leaves us with new feelings that can hardly be compared to KC other albums. New bands by the name of KC (unlike other cases, it's not right to use here the regular &quot;Mark 1&quot; &quot;Mark 2&quot; etc., cause every &quot;Mark&quot; brought us new band that hardly uses old material) brought us new musical directions. Basicly I think that KC days of John Wetton were the best of its long history, and Red was the best of these days. &quot;Red&quot; is powefull-hard rock item, that no wonder that years later, Fripp likes to play it. &quot;One more red nightmare&quot; is done great especially by Wetton and Mel Collins on saxes. I could expect a hard rock band to make it a cover version, because this item has great potencial - but this is me. &quot;Fallen angel&quot; and &quot;Starless&quot; are melodic great classics, but as usual, Fripp did'nt let perfect harmony to control his music. So sooner or later you can find those stange noises entering to charming songs. This is Fripp and his artistic way and I accept that. But the stars in that review are given by me... so please forgive me for the one missing star. I do have problems with noises.
B000007OY0|5.0|Tim Robbins stars as Andy, a banker who is put into prison and on the way finds trouble and some friends. He becomes great friends with Red (Morgan Freeman), and their friendship builds up in the movie till it reaches it's maximum peak. This movie is a \\"Total Triumph\\", and probably the best movie of the century. I have been writing stories so I can make movies when I'm older and thought I could make some of the best movies ever. But I would never make a movie near as good as this one. It's mainly a prison film which suprises viewers. Great acting by the main actors, and in my opinion should have won 'Best Picture' and many other awards it was nominated for. I gotta say Stephen King is an excellent writer. Watch this movie!
B00003XB8K|5.0|I love Enigma and I love Cretu's work, and this album is proof of it. After the first Enigma album, Cretu has tried to change his style on his next two albums, making an almost radio friendly sound with &quot;Cross of changes&quot; (the likes of &quot;return to innocence&quot;). This album is a return to the old school Enigma sound, complete with the familiar beats and rifts. As usual, there is the amazing use of remixing operatic favourites (Carmina Burana) into the trancey drums, and sultry vocals. If you liked Mcmxc A.D., get this one and complete your collection.
B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks in my opinion is simply, the best television show ever made.  The work of David Lynch and Mark Frost come across well in each and every episode of Twin Peaks.  The way that David Lynch conveys things is excellent.  If you are familiar with Lynch's works, he has a reoccurring ideal about people.  And that ideal is that everyone, even the most seemingly simple and open people, have something to hide.  No one is what they seem, and if you dig deep enough, you can find that even the best of people have a skeleton or two in their closet.  It is a thought that makes you think, and keeps you captivated.  Twin Peaks makes good use of this principle.  You start to watch the show, and get familiar with the characters, and then learn things you would have never guessed.  It's quite simply amazing.  Twin Peaks was a show made well before it's time.  Ten years many people couldn't handle the heavy thinking and symbolism that was involved with Twin Peaks, and it was ultimately canceled.  But this does not take away the fact that Twin Peaks can easily be called the best Television show ever made.  If you are looking for quality, look no further than Twin Peaks.  But if you are looking for a show that will spoon feed you information and not make you think, then you should probably find something else.  But who knows, maybe people are finally ready for Twin Peaks?
B00004X01U|3.0|Music is such a letdown after Madonna's previous triumph, Ray of Light from 1998.  Music is a mess as it tries to combine underground techno-funk (Music, Impressive Instant), with digital<BR>ballads (I Deserve It, Nobody's Perfect), and country/pop techno<BR>songs (Don't Tell Me, Gone).  Sometimes the album works wonderfully, particularly the sensational Impressive Instant,<BR>the funky Don't Tell Me and the lovely mid-tempo ballad What It Feels Like For a Girl.  Paradise (Not For Me) is a haunting electro-ballad, but it seems out of place on this album (it would have suited Ray of Light).  Runaway Lover is a sub-par dance song, so lazy that you wonder how Madonna even let in on this album.  I Deserve It is such a joyless song that it's hard to believe that it's actually a love song in which Madonna is talking about finding true love.  Amazing is certainly catchy, but it's so similar to 1999's Beautiful Stranger that it hardly seems trend-setting from Madonna.  And that's the major problem with Music, it simply doesn't wow us like previous efforts.  I know the title track is a big hit, but I think it's one of Madonna's laziest hits.  It features banal lyrics and a dance beat that is memorable, but not inspiring.  At ten tracks, the album is short and lacklustre.  A disappointment.

0451194861|3.0|I have been hooked on King's Dark Tower series ever since I read the second installment.  Unfortunately, Wizard and Glass had the same problems that plagued the third-installment:  Too long, too wordy and too slow.  In fact, it took me a good 3 years to finish the book, mainly because I had a hard time staying awake during the first 300 pages.  Luckily, the last 350 pages were an excellent read, reminding me of why I have been a Stephen King fan since I was a young boy.<br />The book picks up right where the second installment ended.  After page 100, the story chronicals Roland's adventurous youth, and particularly focuses on his first love interest.  Roland's story provides insight to the one thing the reader has been trying to figure out since the first installment:  Roland's facination with finding the Dark Tower.<br />Part of the reason why I found this installment to be the weakest of the series is because we get little interaction with the supporting characters we have grown to love from the previous installments.  Because each installment is published every 4 or 5 years, we eagerly await each book and have high expectations.  It didn't appear that King knew where this story was going.  King's rambling put me asleep.  I wish it would have put me on the edge of my seat.    <br />King knows one thing:  his readers are facinated by the Dark Tower series, so much so that ultimately, we will stick through until the ending.  Non-King fans would have dropped the book after page 250.<br />Regardless, King's wizardry has cast its spell on me, and I can't wait for  the Dark Tower V.
B000002JR8|5.0|This is Pantera doing what Pantera does best...creating an absolutely brutal CD.  Becoming &amp; 5 Minutes Alone certainly stand out as Pantera classics, along with a few of my other favorites like Slaughtered, Shedding Skin, and Planet Caravan.  This is a great album.  A great followup to VDOP, and arguably their best album.  A must have!
B00004XQ8E|5.0|Out of the many &quot;Das Lied&quot;s in my collection--starting with Bernstein/Fischer-Dieskau/King, purchased when I was a junior in high school, this is undoubtledly the nonpareil.  I have owned this recording in one form or another for over thirty years--in fact, I even ordered a copy of Decca's previous CD remastering from England when I couldn't find it here, and so I was a tad hesitant to purchase another copy when this release came out; I suppose it was the three Ruckert songs that made me decide to purchase it.  A quick comparison with the earlier CD sold me on this one right away.  There is a clarity to the orchestra's detailing and to the singing that just wasn't there in earlier versions.  The inclusion of the original cover art was a bonus, as well.  This is a heartbreaker--Ferrier's wonderful dark voice is unequalled in any other performance I've heard--including Walter's earlier recording with Thorberg, as well as Christa Ludwig's with Bernstein, etc. Julius Patzak approaches his parts with a passionate abandon that I prize as well.  If you care anything about Mahler, you must own this recording, along with EMI's latest re-release of  Ferrier's Kindertotenlieder.  There's nothing to compare.  One of the greatest of great recordings, and better than ever!
B000002UAR|5.0|I think this CD is one of the best ones there is. My favorite song is 'Here, There, and Everywhere'. It's an awesome CD.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Probably one of the most flamboyant transfers from \\"stage to screen\\" I've seen in a long time, \\"HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH\\" leaves those who experiences it smeared with cheap glittery lipstick and enough gender-bending enuendo to boot. <br />John Cameron Mitchell and Steven Trask created the rock star, glitter drag queen punk rock world of Hedwig with so much depth and jocularity that not only is Hedwig fun and entertaining, but thought provoking, nasty, and infectious. We become sympathetic for Hedwig; rooting for her in all her anti-hero rock star best and worst of times. Not only is Hedwig determined to live his/her tragically down and out rock star dream, but discover the missing fabled \\"other half\\" that completes him as a person, two beings become one in a portrait of all-encompassing love. \\"HEDWIG\\" and Mitchell, who does such a wonderful job directing and playing Hedwig (since he originated the role), are absolutely spellbinding by blatantly inviting you into burn and afterglow of Hedwig's story. <br />Masterfully directed, filmed, scripted, highlighted by blazing moments of shear musical punk rock bliss (the animations are great too!), \\"HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH\\" is a gem of art house cinema. When \\"RENT\\" hasn't payed yet, and \\"TOMMY\\" still can't hear or see you, then rock opera be damned! \\"HEDWIG\\" IS HERE!
0201485672|4.0|Much of what the author says is common sense in the OO field. Having said that, it is also true that common sense is not all that common in practice. This book does do a valuable service is in assembling the catalog of refactorings and naming them. Books like this and other books on design patterns (you know them) try to make a science out of an activity (design) that is essentially an art form. That is progress.
B00005OB0A|4.0|Totally fun Euro-beat.  Can't believe she's not heard more of in the States.  Well I'm an American and I have her stuff.  Great tunes for working out, parties, and other stuff.  &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; is excellent.  Former D-Mob queen, Cathy Dennis, produced and wrote a number of the tracks too!
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd is so awesome!  I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it a couple of days ago.  It's just one of those cds that you might as well just hit the repeat button on your player because it's not not going to satisfy you to hear it just once.  The combination of rock and rap is superb.  I also totally agree with a previous reviewer that you don't need to curse to be angry and get your point across.  That's one of the many reasons I am so pleased with this album.  Another is the fantastic duality of Chester Bennington's voice; he can sound so haunting and innocent one minute then the next he's in your face, full of emotion and intensity.  Each song will stick in your head and they get better each time you listen to them.  As a whole, this album totally rocks and I encourage all who have had any inhibitions of buying it to just go out and get it (you'll love it!).  Kudos to you Linkin Park, for being such extraordinary artists.
B00004TJFL|3.0|Let's see, we just had his Return, this is his Revenge, his Curse followed...for awhile it looked like the Halloween movies would be using the Pink Panther titles as sequel subheaders.  Thankfully we were all spared Trail of..., Son of..., and Strikes Again as titles.  For the record only Halloween 5 appears as the title on the film itself.<br />After reinventing 4's cliffhanger ending, part 5 jumps from October 31, 1988 to October 31, 1989 (the year that this entry was made) and another set of victims to be in a town that really should just cancel the stupid holiday.  Myers again chases his sister's daughter all over town while the quite insane Dr. Loomis (this guy needs his license yanked, and pronto) moans and groans about evil and such.  While the script does attempt to develop its characters more than the average slasher flick would, it cannot overcome the far too many plot contrivances (such as having an elderly hermit keeping a comatose, bullet riddled man around his cabin for an entire year without calling for medical help or something) of the silly plot, perhaps the fault of the narrative concept concocted by series presenter Moutapha Akkad.  Mr. Akkad wanted annual Halloween movies, each year 'revealing' more pieces of the mystery behind the Myers rampage.  It didn't work, being all tease and no substance.<br />Director Dominique Othenin-Girard does handle things well, packing in action and atmosphere.  The movie, while a tad longer than the average Halloween outing, is far from inert and boring.  It just isn't particularly suspenseful or scary.  Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasance do contribute good performances and composer Alan Howarth once again creates creepy riffs on Carpenter's classic themes.  But the minuses (which include a horrible cliffhanger ending) cancel out the pluses and I can only recommend this to hardcore Halloween buffs.
B00003CXAA|5.0|what can i say!?<br />i love the godfather!
B0000039LE|5.0|First word of advice, forget the sequels...they ruin the interior logic of this suspenseful and terrifying thriller.  Second is to see it in the widescreen versions, you'll be glad you did.  John Carpenter is every bit the widescreen director.<br />In the dead of night on October 31, 1963 six year old Michael Myers murders his teenaged sister.  15 years later, in 1978, at the age of 21, he is about to be moved to an adult mental health facility.  But he escapes and returns to Haddonfield to kill again.  And again.  And again.<br />It's a simplistic story wonderfully told.  Screenwriters John Carpenter and Debra Hill build the characters and the atmosphere, constantly dropping hints that, perhaps, Michael Myers is more than just a serial killing nutcase.  He might just be the boogeyman itself.  Carpenter relies on cat and mouse techniques, keeping Myers in the background, unseen by the characters but visible to the audience.  It is a wonderful manipulation that sends icy spider legs dancing up and down the viewer's spine.  A great movie to turn out the lights and watch by the glow of the television after all the trick or treaters have gone home.  An essential for any movie library.
B00005MP58|1.0|Confession:  I did not catch this series on television, even in reruns (which seem to be every  month on A&amp;E).  Watching it on DVD, I must say that it is very nicely done -- quite lively and splendid.  The costuming and sets are great, as is the acting.  Really classic British production -- high quality and entertaining, as well as fairly faithful to the book (a few changes here and there for dramatization).  But unfortunately, like many reviewers here, I found that the DVD itself was a poor quality.  Colors are washed out and the scenes often vary from way too dark to way too light.  Outdoor scenes put an awful glow onto the actors faces, in one instance bathing out Jennifer Ehle's face entirely.  I was continually adjusting my television set for brightness and contrast -- back and forth, back and forth.  Great exercise, but I really just wanted to sit and relax, enjoy my knitting and the film.  Pitiful transfer to DVD.  I'm rather shocked the manufacturer would allow this quality.  Beware of this problem and hesitate -- wait to purchase the DVD until you can be assured that the manufacturer has fixed this problem.
B00005LC1H|5.0|For sheer rewatchable pleasure, it would be hard to find a better DVD investment than Fawlty Towers. I've watched the episodes many times and keep finding new comic bits, puns, or facial expressions   to laugh at. The writing is tight and well-crafted. One understands why this series is watched 25 years after it initial broadcast and will be watched for decades to come.<BR>The DVD is cleanly transferred and is filled with extras, most notably interviews with Cleese and the cast. Unfortunately, co-writer Connie Booth does not appear. The directors commentary is sub par and filled with bad sound and heavy breathing marring the otherwise high quality of the other bonus features. If Shakespeare ever did a sit-com this would be it. Good writing like this series lasts. One can only hope hollywood will get a copy of this DVD and start hiring writers again. All the rest follows, including the superb cast who all credit the high-level of the writing as their primary motivation for doing television.
B000001FW9|3.0|Gentle Giant's second album is definitely a very challenging<br />album to listen to. It is certainly more complex than their first<br />album, but unfortunately, not even half as listenable. I respect<br />what they're doing here, really! My two favorite tracks are<br />&quot; Pantagruel's Nativity&quot;, which has a wonderful heavy metal gui-<br />tar riff from Gary Green and &quot; The Wreck&quot;, which has some very<br />nice singing during the verses. As for the rest,...well, it takes<br />alot of getting used to! There are times on this album that it<br />sounds like they're trying to make the music too complex to en-<br />joy! It is a very daring and adventurous album, but it's not as<br />hard hitting as some of their later albums! I wish I had a better<br />vocabulary to describe their music!!!!!!!!!
0140186409|5.0|This book sat and sat on my book shelf for years.  Thinking it would be one of those &quot;classics&quot; that I &quot;should&quot; read I neglected it.  One day I picked it up and found out the my fears were misplaced.  It reads like any pleasurable popular fiction, with suspence, mystery and great characters, but it also goes beyond and delivers a powerful and heart wrenching message.<br />How do &quot;we&quot; (those in power, those with wealth, those with land, those with plenty) choose to neglect &quot;them&quot; (powerless, poor, disenfranchised)?????  This book isn't so much a look at political systems or an indictment against the rich, it really is a deep glare into the heart of man.  And man's heart is often a dark and terrible place.<br />What really makes this book great are the little victories, those things that made me the reader long for the great sense of love and community that followed the Joad family wherever they went.<br />  Sometimes a man's heart has been recreated, and when it has, nothing dark or evil can overcome.
B000002R0P|3.0|Interview contains my favorite Gentle Giant song ever;that<br />song is &quot;Design&quot;. The whole structure of the song is unique and<br />very unpredictable.The vocal rounds on this song are GG's best;<br />they're complex and very funny at the same time and do a very<br />good job interpreting the very sad lyrics. The percussion and the<br />wierd sound effects in the middle of the song are hilarious, but<br />my favorite part is Derek Shulman's vocal entrance at the start<br />of verse two. As for the rest, &quot; I lost my head&quot; is a perfect<br />combination of GG's medieval and melodic side and their hard rock<br />side. The second half of the track was a sign of things to come<br />for GG. The title track is another great song, showing off their<br />wonderful sense of humour. The low point of the album, for me, is<br />&quot;Timing&quot;, which has some very annoying vocals in it and some very<br />headache inducing violin playing! INTERVIEW may not be GG's best<br />album, but it definitely has it's moments!
B00004XQP4|3.0|green day is gone and thats what is left from them, i am sorry to say that and to give up on the band that i belive was the best band ever but green day sold all of us out long ago, i don't know what has happened but what ever they had they have lost it the first four albums are much more preaches than gold but what came after that is just average stuff you can hear any were from lots of other bands, There music isn't bad but its not as good as it used to be, not even the same flavor <br />i understand that every band gotta change and evolve but to the best, i think what use to inspire bille joe of making his music is now gone after all the money he got, he is not a burnout any more, green day are not the garage band any more, artistically green day has evolved but there message is lost. <br />every thing good ends so quickly but green day ended faster than usual the hole music scene right now is a joke i think &quot;thanks for MTV&quot;, any way i still love them and I'll keep listing to dookie until the day i die and i owe them that.<br />Overall green day are still a great band nimrod,warning had there moments but any body who knows green day well understand what i am trying to say, this is not green day
0061040967|5.0|Famed writer Terry Pratchett has amassed a huge readership in the UK, and a smaller but still BIG readership in the USA. With all that backing his books, he apparently has chosen to branch out and experiment a little in his latest ventures. And this experiment is a roaring success.<br />I was a little nervous about this book, afraid that with big full-color pictures...it would have a lame storyline and just be good pictures. I was grateful to be wrong; in recent years some of Pratchett's books have taken a more serious slant, but this book shows what he is best at: Poking fun. His rapier-sharp wit takes on the barbarians in the typical fantasy novels, as well as god pantheons and a bit of space travel to boot.<br />Cohen the Barbarian was a fearsome hero once before, leader of the Silver Horde. He's pretty old, though, as one can see from the cover--though he often loses his false teeth, he's still pretty feisty and remembers the old days where you could pillage, plunder and \\"ravish\\" without that pesky civilization thing getting in the way. So he concocts a scheme: Blow up the gods. There are two teensy problems: The gods are incredibly powerful, and if he were to succeed, Discworld would end.<br />Patrician Vetinari gets news of this, as the Silver Horde (assorted decrepit barbarians: Boy Willie, Truckle the Uncivil, Mad Hamish) travels to the hub of Discworld (where the gods live) with a kidnapped minstrel (to compose a saga about this last amazing heroic quest) and Vena the Raven-haired, an ex-warrior babe who isn't so raven-haired anymore. (She's in better shape than the Silver Horde, tho). They also team up with an ex-Dark-Lord, Evil Harry Dread, who's gotten out of the Dark Lord business and is as old as the rest of them (though considerably saner)<br />Vetinari doesn't intend to let them end the world, however. So he enlists Leonard of Quirm, an immensely talented inventor from a prior book. Leonard creates a spacecraft-like device, and fan faves Carrot and cowardly wizard Rincewind join the mission (and the Librarian). They'll encounte aging barbarians posing as minor gods, the pantheon of deities, dragons of several breeds, zero-gravity comedy, Death's cameos, elephant legs, and will actually walk on the moon!<br />Where to start? Well, the story itself is hilariously told (well duh, it's Pratchett), about barbarians and kick-butt heroines, Dark Lords and nefarious henchmen, straight out of any hack fantasy work--with the small problem that they're all about eighty years old. Since we never see aging hack heroes/villains in other novels, this is a refreshing change. It's also great to see fan faves like Leonard (Leonardo da Vinci of Discworld), naive Carrot, and Rincewind who still doesn't want to be on adventures but has to go anyway. The Librarian gets a bit more action than in many Discworld books!<br />Dialogue is great as always, especially the delicious scene where Cohen and Evil Harry Dread meet up again: \\"You've GOT to let the Dark Lord escape. Everyone knows that.\\" \\"Got to leave yourself some work for tomorrow.\\" \\"I mean, I always left a secret back entrance in my Mountain of Dread, I employed really STUPID people as cell guards...\\"<br />With that out of the way, let me go on to the illustrations. They're excellent. Many fans may not like having pix of such characters as the Patrician, Rincewind, etc shown to them rather than imagining their own, but I enjoyed them overall. Rincewind's shrinking appearance and sort of tattered beard and clothes are great; Patrician looks sufficiently sinister; the Librarion looks kooky (or \\"ook-y\\"); we also get clear views of such characters as Leonard, trolls, Death (with a little kitty), and what the sinister dragon-armor of a Dark Lord looks like after about forty years.<br />Carrot was the only one I was disappointed in--that face looks too hard to be our Carrot! I will continue thinking of him as a Stephen Snedden look-alike. I didn't expect Ponder Stibbins to look like an adult, clinically depressed Harry Potter, but I got used to it. And it's worth it alone for the GORGEOUS two-page spread of Great A'tuin, the four Elephants and Discworld on top of it all!<br />What didn't I like? Well, it's too short--I wished it had been longer, though it does say \\"fable.\\"...<br />...this is a hilarious new Discworld adventure, not to be missed. (Also recommended for those who enjoy this sort of spoofery: all Discworld books, Diana Wynne Jones' \\"Tough Guide to Fantasyland\\")n adult, clinically depressed Harry Potter, but I got used to it.

B00003CX9W|5.0|Never a big fan of Disney animation, this reviewer has always made Fantasia a major exception in his catalogue.  And it's safe to assume that most people in the same boat (those who favor Kubrick and Scorsese over Cinderella and Snow White) will feel the same way.  Sure, Fantasia has its share of cute, furry animals and ferries to boot.  But the animation / classical score combo is simply awe-inspiring.  How many features start things off with a series of brilliant abstract images matched to Bach's &quot;Tocata and Fugue in D Minor&quot;?  Mickey Mouse has rarely been as enchanting as he is in &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot;, and &quot;The Rites of Spring&quot; sequence is as close to naturalism as classic animation has ever reached on film. But it's the film's finale, the &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;/&quot;Ave Maria&quot; sequence, that is truly breathtaking.  Never has evil been personified in motion picture history as it is here, and it is unlike anything Disney has attempted before or since.  Forget every other Disney &quot;masterpiece&quot;; this is the real deal!
B000002BUY|5.0|Other than the other 3 incubus albums I own, this is the only CD I can continue to play and enjoy.  The music is amazingly brilliant and fun to listen to.  As much as I miss this sound in the new CD's I know I can always go back and listen to S.c.i.e.n.c.e.  A Certain Shade of Green was what originally attracted me to this CD, but there is not one track on here that I can pick apart as bad.  Even thought the funk beats are much more mellow on this album, they are still in the undertones of the notes on this CD and they provide a fantastic backbone.  Anyeone who aspires to be an Incubus fan should buy this CD!
B000002BUY|5.0|If you are a incubus fan, you don't need to read this; but if Incubus is brand new for you, stick around...  This cd is a must have;  at first the cd might not seem as great as Make Yourself, but it's quite amazing.  It's a perfect blend of hard rock, a touch of jazz, and the unique style of rapping that only Brandon Boyd can provide.  It starts up with 4 excelent songs (Redefine, Vitamin, New Skin and Idiot Box), then a little later, the instrumental Magic Medicine, followed by the great Certain Shade Of Green (one of the best Incubus songs).  Then, inmersed in 3 quite heavy songs are the jazzy compositions which make this cd stand out from the rest:  Summer Romance and Deep Inside, which in my opinion are THE best Incubus songs ever.  All in all, this is one GREAT cd, and gives worthy mention as Incubus one of the best bands right now.
0790729628|1.0|Bear with me, this anecdote is relevant to the poor quality of this dvd. I admit it, I am a Blade Runner Geek. I have the original cut on laser disk. I saw the director's cut the second it hit the theatre years ago in a new state-of-the-art Sony theater in NYC. The projection booth was fully &quot;automated&quot; and it began rolling the film with audio only, the screen was totally black. Finally after 5 excruciating minutes, the picture belatedly came on and the theatre manager thought he could just keep the movie rolling  until a near-riot started in the theatre. This was a Blade Runner audience. We demanded to start again from the beginning, we weren't going to be deprived of seeing a pristine print of the breathtaking opening sequence. The manager explained to the angry crowd that he couldn't just back up the projector, that it would require the time-consuming chore of removing the reel and rewinding it on a bench and the mob shouted:&quot;do it now, we don't care how long it takes.&quot; And the contrite manager eventually started the film from the beginning 20 minutes later.<br /> Well, Warner Bros. has done a similarly bad job of presenting B.R. on dvd. Right from the first 5 seconds, squinting at aliasing blurred titles, it looks as though you're watching a vhs tape that has been rented 100 times rather than a brand new dvd of a restored film. Oddly, the letterbox doesn't fully extend to the left and right edge of the tv screen. A smallish rectangle view floats in the middle of the screen with ragged pulsing edges. Unable to stomach watching the whole movie looking like this I scanned ahead to see a poorly transferred picture complete with dust and even a curly hair making a guest appearance! Like that hapless theatre manager, Warner Studios has made a big mistake underestimating the Blade Runner audience--we demand a refund and a re-release done right!
B0000256KE|5.0|last roxy album with the great eno.
B00003CXWU|3.0|Johnny Depp continues his tradition of not selling out completely to the mainstream and making movies that are, at the least, intriguing. BLOW is a good movie, technically very well-crafted, not overlong, not indulgent. Of course I don't care the least about JUng's final destiny, I hope he rottens in jail. Penelope Cruz is the only weak actor performance here. All in all, a good movie without purpose.
B00003CX5P|5.0|For so long, many Star Wars fans have wondered when a DVD version of any of the Star Wars episodes would be available for sale to the public.  There have been rumors that no DVD release would be made for &quot;Star Wars&quot; until the next two episodes are completed.  Of course, this angered many Star Wars fans.<br />But when the word came out months ago that a release was in the works, one could not imagine that the &quot;Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace&quot; DVD would be setting a standard for DVD's in jamming what they could on two DVD's and giving fans more than what they have expected.<br />First, let's talk about the movie.  The movie is provided via anamorphic Widescreen with an aspect ration of 2:35:1.  The movie looks beautiful and the audio utilizes English Dolby 5.1 Surround EX.  Did I say the movie looks beautiful?<br />Now, the second DVD.  I don't know how long it will take me to finally view the complete DVD because it's jam packed with featurette's, deleted scenes, documentaries and much more.<br />One thing is that there are some deleted scenes I wish they added in the movie such as one deleted scene featuring the green bad guy known as Greedo (who was in the fourth Star Wars episode/first movie) and the Web documentaries galore which include the &quot;Bad Droid Karma&quot; which features the difficulties of making R2D2 work.<br />If there was one nitpicky feeling that I had for this DVD was that it didn't feature the movie in DTS.  I'm wondering if we are going to see a &quot;multiple version&quot; like the videos of the Star Wars series was released to the market.  But I'm still pleased with the Dolby 5.1 Surround EX.<br />Although not my favorite &quot;Star Wars&quot; in the series, the DVD is just plain awesome and I'm just hoping if they release the other episodes on DVD, that the others can measure up to this one.<br />An amazing DVD giving new meaning to &quot;jam packed&quot; when it comes to special features.
B00003CXZ3|1.0|Guy Pearce adds another bad tasted movie to his curriculum, summing this up with the utterly ridiculous RAVENOUS. The director had one single purpose here: to enter the history of movie making by shooting the first picture that moves backwards. Ok, he achieved it. Congratulations. But the history... my God, there is none!!! even the \\"Moral\\" dilemma of living in that kind of memory disorder is ridiculous !! The solution, for Leonard, is to become a killer, a good one because he doesn't feel regret (because he soons forget what he did!!!). When Teddy says that he already killed the \\"certain\\" killer of his wife, and proves it by showing a photo of LEonrad smiling full of blood, Leonard destroys the evidence (by means of burning this photo and the photo of the guy he just had killed), and selecting Teddy to be his next \\"target\\", the next man to be hunted to give some meaning to his life!!!! Bad taste, bad taste, bad taste. (...)
B00003CX9E|1.0|(...) With films of the caliber of Citizen Kane this is all the more important...and I can't believe that they would go to so much trouble to release this fine film, with all these \\"bonus materials\\" AND NOT PRESENT IT IN WIDESCREEN!

(And for a nice dash of salt in the wound, they use a widescreen still of one of the first scenes in the movie as a background for the menu&#8230;hit &#8220;Play,&#8221;  and then watch that same scene in all 2/3rds of it&#8217;s glory!)

B000000WF0|5.0|Put simply, this is the ultimate music album. Period. The Verve are back again to conquer and thrill the music world with their various songs which span all the emotions, space and time and maybe a little farther than that. From the soaring Space and Time which may not have been written as a audio journey through space but feels like it to the emotional &quot;One Day&quot; which has the feeling of a friend leaving at sunset, Urban Hymns captures the feeling of all the emotions of life. I think that this album also captures the musical artistry that the Verve have always had and used so well. <br /> &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; is a wonderful and beautiful piece with an excellent symphonic orchestration.. yet the ironic beauty of &quot;Life is a Bittersweet&quot; symphony shows through in life's sad moments. Then, &quot;Sonnet&quot; may sound like a 50's rock song, but eventually when the song speeds up, you get the feeling as if you're travelling past meadows and beautiful mountains. I don't know, I just feel that way. &quot;Space and Time&quot;, which is the first song I ever heard from the Verve, has this soaring, vast feeling of the cosmos and it's the closest thing you can do to feel to fly in  space to going on the space shuttle. Then, the phenominal &quot;One Day&quot; has a sad, but subtley beautiful feeling and the musical orchestration of guitars creates an emotional atmosphere. <br />Overall, this album is a one of a kind album from a band whose intentions of making music doesn't seem like a career.. it seems like it's the Verve's mission. In that case, this album may very well signify &quot;Mission Exceptionally Accomplished.&quot;
B00003CX5P|5.0|I'm so tired of hearing how bad this movie was. If people thought the movie was so bad, why did they buy the DVD?<br />Anyways...<br />I bought this DVD because I'm a Star Wars fan and I liked the film. Was it as good as it could have been? No. Was it bad? No. I saw it eight times in the theatre and a few times since. I can't say that about many films.<br />As far as the quality of this DVD goes, it's fantastic! Where the film may not have lived up to expectations, this DVD certainly does. The picture and sound quality are top notch. The lack of DTS is not missed. Fans should know that Lucas is about THX not AC3. The disc even has a great feature that helps you optimize your sound for THX on 7 channels. I doubt anyone that has complained about this has even listened to the disc.<br />Certainly the extra features are welcomed and well done. There is an hour long making-of documentary. Every trailer and TV spot is included as is the music video for Duel of the Fates. One of the best features are the seven deleted scenes that Lucasfilm went back and finished for this DVD including a whole additional lap for the podrace.<br />There are also some overlooked features. Most people think of the menues as an after thought, but this DVD has the best menues I've ever seen, and there are 3 different main menues that randomly load each time you play the DVD so it's not always the same. There is a DVD software viewer for watching DVDs on your PC. I found this software to actually be better than the one that came with my player. Also for those with a DVD ROM is access to exclusive web content like the trailer to Episode II on Nov. 9th.<br />You really have to see how fantastic this DVD really is. I got mine for $17.99 which was more than a bargain. You most likely have already seen the movie, so that shouldn't be the question. As to how well the film was adapted to DVD format, there should be no question.

B00005J6UP|5.0|Anybody who was growing up in the 80's understands the greatness of this movie.  Who could forget Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Chunk, Data, Sloth, and the Fratelli's.  I think the one thing that makes this movie the most memorable is the great music.  Let's get serious, Cyndi Lauper was a poster child for the 80's and even though overall her music bites, it fit perfectly into the movie.  Although the movie does have some of it's cheesy moments, overall it is a good representation of that era.(...)This DVD brings back all of the memories of seeing the movie in the theater, especially with the cutscenes and the unforgetable octopus scene.  The only real disappointment is that Spielberg didn't integrate the cutscenes right into the movie like they did with Superman.  Oh well, it is better than nothing. If you have a DVD player but not this movie, get it.  You won't be disappointed.
6305252521|4.0|I was intrigued by the ingenious premise of this film. The Truman Show represents the ultimate in 'reality' television. Weir manages to pull off a blend of surreal comedy and human drama in a way that a lesser director might not have achieved, managing to keep the two elements in perfect balance without losing the impact of either.<br />The film is a powerful tale that takes the current trend in reality television to the nth extreme, the story of a man whose life IS a TV show (unbeknownst to him). It lampoons the dangerous direction of current television, a journey which only seems to have accelerated since this movie was made. Manipulation, artificiality, the stifling of creativity and imagination, and the scandalous objectifying of human lives are all exposed in this satire. It shows us where the media is going, though its warnings go unheeded.
B00003CXB4|2.0|ok,i had to give this two stars for one reason. sure it was a great film, but it was such a ripoff of Kimba, the white Lion. I am a huge anime fan, and when i saw this, me and my friend looked at eachother. had we seen this already? almost everything is identical. from the names simba and kimba to the faces of their father's in the clouds. everything is identical. disey should pay...
B00004TRD8|5.0|Without out a doubt, the best film ever made in tha last 100 years. This film contains great flexing and pumping in the special effects departmant. Incredible ground breaking acting by tha Schwarzenator. He manages to include an Oscar-winning performance in the action departmant. This dvd contains neva-before seen footage, way better than the Rocky dvd neva-before seen footage. Tha video transfer is so clean that yu can see Arnuld's puwerful biceps and incredible physique like neva before. Tha sound is so amazing that yu can hear tha sweat rubbing against each otha in Ahnuld's naked scene. I saw this film in my huge home theata, and I had neva had such a puwerful experience since watching Cunan tha Barbarian on dvd.  Jimmy Cameron pruves why he's tha best directur in Hullywood. Yu knew Titanic would be a great Oscar-winning film, when yu see Arnuld shuuting thousands of rounds of ammunition senselessly. In addition, Edward Furlong's role as a rebel without a cause is a can't miss. Linda Hamilton's great acting and muscular physique makes yu wonda if she is a Terminata herself. This is the best dvd out in tha market. Forgat Stallone, Willis, Seagal, Van Damme, and Edward James Olmos. When Arnie is in tuwn to kick to major liquid metal buttcheeks, you knuw that the real deal is on.Don't furgat he's a cybernatic machine frum tha year 2029. If yu don't buy this dvd, John Connor will command him to take your leather clothes,your boots, and your motorcycle. Hasta La Vista, baby :-&gt;

078322687X|5.0|THE BREAKFAST CLUB is one of those rare '80s unknown film gems. It's right up there with '80s films like DEAD POETS SOCIETY and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it in high school sophomore year and absolutely loved it. The cast is just stunning from Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, and Anthony Michael Hall. My favorite character is probabaly Hall's character, &quot;the brain&quot;. I'd give this movie ten stars if I could! This movie is about four very different high school students who all end up together in Saturday detention for different reasons. At first they dislike each other and harass each other, but as the movie goes on, they learn how to have fun even in Saturday detention and how to appreciate each other's differences while they discuss to each other why they got detention. I think anybody who's been to high school (no matter what generation you went to high school in) can relate to this movie in some way or another. And anyone who's gone to high school must see THE BREAKFAST CLUB. I strongly recommend that you buy this DVD today - it's a movie you'll want to treasure and watch over and over again!
6305508550|5.0|This movie was done in classic 80's style and has strong similarities to one of my old favorites: &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;.  In both movies, an average guy one day decides to turn against his mundane and hopeless life to win the day.  It even shares the element of a hilarious goofball whose character is slowly developed in little transitional scenes to receive the butt of some joke.  In Better Off Dead, it was Ricky; and in Office Space, Milton (the character whose short sketches by Mike Judge gave birth to this movie).  David Herman was sort-of ok as Michael Bolton, but I wish they'd cast John Cusack for his part.<br />The movie focuses on a trio of software developers who do some really stupid things in the face of a company layoff.  The plot isn't great, but what carries the movie is that every scene is darned funny -- most of it is achingly so.  <br />I work at a fairly large software company, and everyone on the technical side there is hip to this movie.  The phrase: &quot;Did you get the memo about those new TPS report covers?&quot; has become a pretty standard response.<br />-Jason
B00005J73X|5.0|This Cd is great. It has a lot of his newer and older songs (Live). The live pieces of most songs were recorded long after they were hits. For example, &quot;Living on a Prayer&quot; was big in the late 1980's but the song on the CD was (which was live) was recorded in the late 1990's-2000. Still this is a great buy for Bon Jovi fans.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|After four largely arduous years of painstaking development, when Walt Disney released his initial full-length animated feature upon the world in 1937, every reputable cinema insider, film critic, studio executive, and film business analyst at the time considered this Grimm Fairy based cartoon movie (nicknamed Disney's Folly) to be nothing more or less than professional suicide. Who they considered in their sane minds would sit through an hour and a half cartoon. Primarily who could stand such a prolonged exposure to such brightly tinted colors, conceptually unrealistic images, and plausibly inane child oriented entertainment for such a significant duration. It appeared to the Silver Screen industry that the immensely popular Disney animation studio responsible for such lucrative successes as Steamboat Willie (1st sound animated short) and Flowers and Trees (1st Color animated short) had plundered all of it's amassed wealth and interests into a project that would single-handedly signify it's obituary.<br />With such a relentless stench of failure looming over it's theatrical release on December 21,1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs astoundingly persevered over all of the nay-saying gossip and metamorphosed into an international cultural phenomenon (that comparatively by 1937 standards received crudely equivalent revenue to other film blockbusters such as Star Wars, Jaws, or the Godfather) that heralded in the inception of the Animated Feature as incredibly viable cinematic genre, bolstered the Walt Disney Animated Studios as major Tinsel town heavyweight, and kick started the golden age of Disney Animation that included such milestones as Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi. <br />Amidst the aftermath of it's gargantuan success, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs earned a special technical Academy Award celebrating Disney's massive advances in the art of animation (the award consisted of one large golden statuette and seven miniature ones), created both the massive demand and financial revenue necessary to sustain Disney Studios for years to come, and inspired countless generations of fans to seek animation as a career field. Yet sixty-four years after it was first cherished and adored by children and adults alike, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs still lingers as a colossally endearing cinematic landmark that habitually enthralls, frequently delights, and metaphysically transports us (the adults) to that intangible childhood glee and innocence that is so unfortunately lacking in our lives most of the time. It was the imagination kaleidoscope for generations of children, the granddaddy template for ALL animation films to follow, and the film that introduced such unforgettable characters as Happy, Doc, Bashful, Sneezy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Dopey, Snow White, and the Evil Queen to our collective unconscious for all time. Would really want to have it any other way?<br />As for the Disney Platinum Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it contains a entrancingly THX remastered print of Snow White, a highly informative making-of documentary, deleted scenes (including the famous Soup, Making a Bed for Snow White, Doc and Grumpy's bedroom brawl, and many others) feature commentary, rare inclusive historical drawings, a Disney through the years prospective documentary, rare aborted idea storyboards for Snow White including a fantasy rendition of Someday My Prince will come, the Prince's incarceration at the Evil Queen's castle, and countless others, and numerous other first-class features befitting of this classic.<br />P.S.

Whilst in her drug hazed state, she decides to practice her poetry, which is mistaken for a suicide note (such is her talent.) She then awakes in hospital and is promtly whisked home to her mammy who takes her straight to Cloisters, the local 'mentallers' dry out clinic.<br />There begins an extremely funny, insightful, and often touching story of Rachel and her road to recovery. She is convinced that she doesn't belong in Cloisters (her near suicide wasn't INTENTIONAL) and that she will leave the second that she is free to go. As long as she has never beat a family member about the head with a broken bottle or shot up heroin (smoking it is an entirely different matter) she believes that she is world's apart from her fellow in-mates. However, many revelations are in store for Rachel, and her life could change in way she has never imagined. That is, if she allows herself to admit that musical chairs with a few brown cardigan wearers CAN be fun (ish), even without the use of a narcotic of two. Rachel's Holiday is a fantastic read, that is both highly entertaining and extremely thought-provoking. Get it if you can..

B0000027I6|5.0|In the years following his failed attempt to disband the somber army of rock journeymen he once led, Roger Waters surfaced only occasionally. And by 1992 it was painfully clear that this volcano wasn't going to erupt often. But Amused to Death was no small tremor...it may not have exploded at retail, but for those who did buy it, the ground shook. here was an eruption for the ages. The kind of album you could build a career on, had you not already left a trail of Dark Side of the Moons, Animals, Walls, and Final Cuts in your wake. It was not a concept album the way Dark Side had been, or The Wall, or Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. There was no narrative here. Instead, Roger chose to explore the vein of concept album he had played with on Animals and Final Cut, this time taking it to it's utmost peak. I've never heard this style done better. Roger uses every nuance, every breath, to his advantage. And what you end up with is an album so all-encompassing that it leaves nothing unsaid. Things that came before it, things that have happened since...they are all found here. The terrorist attacks on the WTC and Pentagon? Check songs like Too Much Rope and lyrics like &quot;God wants Crusade, God Wants Jihad, God wants good, God wants bad.&quot; American retaliation? The Bravery of Being Out of Range, Late Home Tonight, part I, and the Perfect Sense duo fit well. <br />The first listen, I didn't know what to think of the album. It had moments that excited me, but nothing made my jaw drop. I was even confused as to where the whole thing was going until the last song, which ties it all together spectacularly. But by the third time I ran it through I was in love, and by the end of that Summer it had broken me. Today it stands as one of the few albums that goes with me everywhere.<br />Scathing, unforgiving, unwilling to accept people who are anything short of the very best they could be, Roger Waters saw fit to create in the early 1990's what would be a soundtrack to much of the decade's events, an attack on a culture increasingly dependant on TV, a cry for a return to a more &quot;Walden&quot;-like lifestyle, and an epiteph for a race that wasn't ready for the powers it created. He did with haunting lyrics and shaken melodies. He did it with an uncanny ability to dance around in seemingly random fits and yet hold fast to the concept at large. He did it the only way he knew how. <br />And he did it all on just one disc.
B00003CXAA|1.0|It is ridiculous that we are expected to pay ... for two good films, one laughable attempt and a disc of \\"bonus\\" materials that you watch once for the novelty then put away forever.  Give me Godfather One and/or Two, but don't expect me to pay good money for the distressingly awful Godfather Three.  My recommendation?  Rent it for now and wait for a fair price for the two films you really want to see.
B000002KYH|5.0|Let me start by saying I recently saw Rod live for the first time (after having been a fan for over 20 yrs) on his current &quot;Human&quot; tour and it was possibly the best damn concert I've ever seen! And that ties into my review in this way, until then the closest I had come to seeing this great entertainer live was this record. And I have to say this record comes pretty close to capturing all the excitement and frenzy of a Stewart concert, plus it showcases most of Rods hits such as the great &quot;Maggie May&quot; all the way down to the equally great &quot;Da Ya think I'm sexy?&quot; And on all the tunes Stewart was in fine voice and the people that worked on this record also did a fine job by just letting it happen and be recorded that way. Even letting the part stay in where 2 female fans showed their appreciation according to the album notes &quot;in topless fashion.&quot;  All in all this is a great album and a must have for anyone who hasn't seen him live and wants to and for any person who just wants to hear a helluva album.  It's great from start to finish, I highly recommend it!
B0000026T4|2.0|I've been following Alice for almost 2 years now (I'm 15, don't blame me for being in the wrong generation) and I love everything of his I've heard.... except this one. The initial track, Poison, is as brilliant as when I first heard it in Alice compilations, but the rest of the album doesn't follow suit at all. As much as I love it, you've gotta admit that Poison is a fairly commercial-sounding track- well imagine that but without the typical Alice genius and you have fairly tacky, dated pop-rock, and that's the rest of this album. Seriously, 'House of Fire' sounds exactly like a Bon Jovi track, as does everything else. I dunno, maybe you like Bon Jovi, but that's not what Alice is famous or liked for among many his fans. I know this album needed to be pretty commercial for it to be Alice's come-back, but I think the music suffered severely. If you're planning on getting into Alice buy Brutal Planet or Billion Dollar Babies, and if you want an Alice album with Poison on it, go for an Alice compilation.
B00003CXXI|5.0|When I went to see Shrek this summer, I was prepared to see a classic &quot;Disney Style&quot; attempt at a kids movie.  I was in for a big suprise.  <BR> Staring a likeable if not slightly repulsive ogre, Shrek takes place in a swamp.  Shrek, the ogre has lived peacefully all alone in his swamp until Lord Farquaad, the shortest ruler you will have ever seen, evicts all Fairy Tale Creatures to the swamp.  Shrek sets out on a quest, accompanied by &quot;Donkey&quot;, to give Farquaad a good talking to and regain his home.  Lord Farquaad meanwhile, has just been told by his trusty Mirror on The Wall, that he is not a true king until he weds a princess.  The Mirror shows him Princess Fiona, held captive in a castle guarded by a dragon, and he is determined to find her.  Only he'd rather not be the one doing the finding. <BR>  When Shrek arrives, demanding his swamp back, Farquaad sees his opportunity.  He assigns Shrek the quest of finding Princess Fiona, and in return Farquaad will return the swamp.  So Shrek and the perpetually annoying Donkey set off in search of the fair Fiona.  Shrek is prepared to run and retrive the princess, but he is not prepared to face the emotion he finds after rescuing Fiona, Love.  <BR> Shrek was hilarious, and thought-provoking,  I would see it again in an instant.  It was enjoyed by my Grandmother, 71, as well as my friend Monica-Jane, 7.  I would strongly suggest people buy this, you'll be in for a real treat!!
B00004SST6|5.0|Absolutely great album!<br />Great performance and absolutely very great recording. The cleanest recording from Benson that I heard to date compared to his previous CDs.<br />I love his rendition of &quot;Lately&quot; which was originally recorded by Stevie Wonder. Other tracks are equally well done as well.<br />A great buy!
B000056K04|5.0|i found this album to be quite good. i never heard any dave matthews before this album, and i must say that i am impressed with the quality of music from this band and i hope they produce more good stuff.
0671027573|5.0|I wish I hadn't read this book, because then I could read it all over again for the first time.  Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.  The Hero and Heroine were an absolute delight, and their first meetings made me laugh out loud, not the best thing to do in a crowded canteen!  The supporting characters were as likeable and entertaining, every girl should have friends like these.  The suspense in the story kept me riveted to the page and I became totally caught up in the plot, each death in the story felt as if someone I personally knew was being stalked and killed!  I grieved with the Heroine and if ever there was a wake I wished I could have attended it was the one found in the pages of this book.  Others might have been able to spot the murderer but I didn't and the end was as exiting and satisfying as the rest of the book, I would give this book my whole hearted approval and its one I will read over and over.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|i must say that i love this film. what creativity and ingenuity! ironic because hardly anything is new in the film. i was very happy to see another musical and hope that the musical genre gets out of its long hybernation. but, while i loved the film and the music in the film, i am not pleased with this album. if it is a soundtrack of the film, where are &quot;Like a virgin&quot; and other, including the hilarious medley in the elephant? why do we need Christina Aguillera and other modern pop artists who didn't contribute to the actual music in the film, but instead are put on there just to attract more of that crowd. i was impressed with baz luhrman, who in his previous two films has gone edgy, but am upset with the producers of this cd who have gone mainstream just to make a few extra bucks. i hope they enjoy their money because it is a loss in artistry.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The ultimate \\"Godfather\\".  The video and audio quality are superb, but I encountered a serious problem with the \\"Bonus Features\\" disc.  I couldn't access most of this disk and, at first, thought the disk was faulty.  When the replacment came and I had the same problem, I learned that it was, in fact, my DVD player that was at fault.  This Toshiba unit that is about two years old, needed something called a \\"Firmware Upgrade\\" that was performed by a nearby service center.  ... , and I now have no problems.  I have learned that many consumers have had similar problems with this DVD. There actually is a disclaimer on the back of the box that states \\"this disk was created in compliance with applicable DVD specifications.  Certain of its advanced features may not play on all machines\\"
B00000K501|5.0|The VHS is awesome, very high quality. The sound is flawless and camera work commendable.<br />(...) There is no naziism in rammstein's work at all. 'Du Hast' means 'You Have' and Heirate Mich means 'Marry Me', quite a sharp contrast to the review's 'You Hate' and 'Worship Me'. In no song do rammstein touch upon the concept of naziism or any other political point for that matter.<br />It sickens me that people can be so ignorant.
089381525X|5.0|These are some of the most powerful photographs ever made.  They are at once disturbing, thought provoking and astonishingly beautiful.  Salgado is a genius of the medium.  He is one of the very few who has managed to elevate photography to a genuine art form.  By comparison, the work of most other contemporary photographers seems like paint-by-numbers dreck.
B00005KARK|4.0|This is another well-endowed DVD release from Disney who are getting up to scratch with their DVD releases! Hurrah!<br />The extras are fitting and informative - the 'making of' documentary is very good and well researched with analysis of the film as well as reminiscing from animators and Disney anoraks, etc.<br />The DVD also does well on account of the inclusion of two animated shorts and the sound process used on animated features. I also like the art gallery which is extensive. <br />The sneak peak at Dumbo II is more a sneak peak BEHIND THE SCENES of Dumbo II (no actual animated footage). Interestingly the DVD also has a trailer for Peter Pan 2: Return to Nether Land where you DO see animation. A lot of it (nice too!).<br />Whilst I love this Anniversary Edition DVD I must admit that I think the animated menu is the most grotesque/naive attempt to animate Dumbo flying over the menu options imaginable! It looks so cheap and nasty compared with CGI circus tent! Taste Disney, taste!<br />Overall a fine DVD - spoiled by an ugly appearance......Isn't that what Dumbo's about anyway? Wow - allegory in a Disney film. What next!
0345413377|5.0|Have you ever read a book that literally broke your heart?  If not, you are missing out on one of life's greatest experiences - and you should immediately read Pullman's trilogy, in particular, The Amber Spyglass.  Pullman's exploration of religion and its place in human life may be impressive and thought-provoking, but the greatest feat of his trilogy is to make you feel not only FOR the main characters but THROUGH them as well.  When Lyra and Will's deep friendship develops into an intense love, you experience it along with them.  Pullman makes it seem so pure and true, you envy these fictional characters - you want that love for yourself, even though it is impossible to achieve.  And when they are torn apart forever, if you have a heart, it breaks.  At the end of this amazing story, you are left feeling shattered, and maybe angry at Pullman for putting you through this experience.  But it is well worth the pain.
B00005N5S5|4.0|The dvd is great with new soundtrak in 5.1 also in the original mono track with a new digital transfer in 16*9 Widescreen format.<br />Also includes a spanish audio track(very funny by the way),but the 5.1 soundtrack sounds spooky specially the gunshots but with the original mono we can hear as was made(sounds better for me).<br />The worst part are the special documents with an interview with Cameron &amp; Arnie that is very boring specially because we can see any moment of the rolling in the behind the scenes;the second document is better as the terminated scenes one specially important that gives you clues about the story.<br />In conclusion a great dvd with full of extras,recommended,buy it,baby.
B000031XBQ|5.0|Yes, it's true: one of the coolest &quot;Latin&quot; CD's comes from a band from Scandinavia. A legendary band from Scandinavia, that is. &quot;Oro: Grandes Exitos&quot; contains Spanish-language versions of several of the best songs from the Swedish/Norwegian quartet of Anni-Frid, Bjorn, Benny, and Agnetha. It seems even as Abba was conquering the English-language pop charts in the late 1970s, they were also prophetically anticipating the Latin explosion of the late 1990s.<br />What a collection: &quot;Fernando,&quot; &quot;Conociendome, Conociendote&quot; (&quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;), &quot;Gracias por la Musica&quot; (&quot;Thank You for the Music&quot;), and more. These songs lose none of their fun in translation; in fact, you might even prefer the Spanish versions. Try &quot;La Reina del Baile&quot; (&quot;Dancing Queen&quot;) and you'll see what I mean. A highly recommended cross-cultural treat.
B00005MP58|5.0|If I was on a desert island (with a DVD player and I guess electricity) this would be one of the movies I'd insist on taking with me - and there aren't many I feel that way about.  I don't rewatch very many movies and this is one of the exceptions, I watch it regularly - there aren't enough superlatives to describe it ... except for the shrill voice of the mother - altho she gave a great performance, the voice went a bit too far.  Other than that, heaven.  Now I've started a Colin Firth collection ...
0780627024|4.0|&quot;Pleasantville,&quot; written and directed by Gary Ross, is a quirky and rewarding blend of comedy and fantasy. The reality-bending premise of the film is simple: a contemporary teen brother-sister duo (the superb Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are zapped into the world of the brother's favorite 1950s black-and-white television sitcom. This &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;-ish premise leads to both humor and social commentary as the two adjust to life in the type of mythic American small town seen in classic TV.<br />&quot;Pleasantville&quot; evokes &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; as the teens are rendered black-and-white in their new environment; this device leads to some remarkable visual effects as their presence gradually causes color to bleed into this world. Maguire and Witherspoon are just part of a superb, multigenerational ensemble cast. Joan Allen is particularly impressive as their 50s era mom; look for the scene where she serves up a mountainous, cholesterol-laden 50s style breakfast to an appalled Witherspoon.<br />The plot and concept, in my opinion, don't hold together completely by the story's end, and the film's message of tolerance seems a bit obvious. But Ross' script is undeniably inventive and intelligent, and the film as a whole is well complemented by memorable visual flourishes. Overall, a worthwhile trip.
B000003BEV|5.0|For years I avoided this supposedly legendary &quot;misfire&quot; because of the almost unanimous panning by critics. But I finally decided to listen for myself as to whether it was really that bad. Was I ever surprised!<br />It is SO plainly obvious this album is a parody of the Beatle's psychedelic period, specifically MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, an atrocious album in its own right. The Stones actually created a send up to the Beatles, and I believe they succeeded. I may be a minority of one, but I believe this album is easily the Stones' best.<br />Yes, there are some tracks on this album that are good in and of themselves, including &quot;Citadel,&quot; &quot;She's a Rainbow,&quot; &quot;2000 Man,&quot; and &quot;2000 Light Years from Home.&quot; And then there are what I believe to be the intentionally terrible songs that will have you rolling on the floor including &quot;Sing This All Together,&quot; Bill Wyman's &quot;In Another Land,&quot; and &quot;On With the Show.&quot; Finally, Brian Jones should be singled out for his extraordinary musical achievements on this album. This is his tour de force.<br />Don't believe the one-star reviews or the critical savaging of this album. These people simply don't get the joke. How sad this gem has been so overlooked.
B000002TQB|4.0|If there's one conclusion to be made after listening to Parklife, it's that Blur are most certainly English, and delight in satirising the English whilst remaining proud of their Englishness themselves. I mean, come on, for a start, the album is named after greyhound racing, and you can't get much more English than that.<br />Next, Albarn's voice is the most blatantly cockney voice since Joe Strummer's early Clash days. Next, 'Tracy Jacks'. I mean, no-one from another country could be called that, and the lyrics certainly couldn't be about a non-English person.<br />Musically (with the possibly exception of the out of place but possibly best song on the album This Is A Low, which is worryingly mature) it isn't exactly complex, or wonderful, but there are come cool, catchy tunes, not least the ultimate annoyingly catchy song of the decade, Girls and Boys.<br />However, lyrically, Albarn shines through, with his wry, funny, witty self-satirising lyrics, along with one song that is most certainly not about England, the great 'Magic America'. Parklife does represent a culture, but it does so in a way that isn't as fantastic as the following years' Oasis and Pulp albums. It is slightly over-rated, but it remains probably their best album, with the possible exception of its polar opposite 13.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is wonderful. I love music and this CD is one that I will be listening to for a long time. I play it over and over again. Every song is exciting and wonderful. I recommend this CD to listeners of the &quot;rock&quot; genre that are looking for a new sound.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Is This It is a great album, however, the media have blown The Strokes out of proportion. Too eager for a band to replicate the sounds of the 60s and 70s, they have ignored the fact that for an album to be truly amazing, it has to be innovative, like nothing that's gone before.<br />That said, it is a great little album, which brings back memorys, shuffling along in its jazzy garage punk kinda way. Great tunes like Is This It, Barely Legal, Someday and Hard To Explain make it worth owning. But the album, for all its enthusiasm and punky energy, lacks any kind of vivid or heartbreaking emotion, and all truly wonderful and classic albums need this ingredient. It will, however, sit in my collection as one of the coolest albums of 2001.
0451203933|5.0|Factual story telling lots about modern military, conflict between high-tech, quick strike US forces, and lower tech Mogadishu bandits, with rocket propelled grenades, and outnumbering US by large multiples.  The situation is complicated with action developing in multiple places at once on the ground, but you can follow it, even though I felt the author jumped around too often, from place to place, and person to person.  It hurt the narrative flow.  Also there are too many names of soldiers, and not enough characterization so you get a feel for them as individuals. But the facts are interesting and important, especially in light of Sept 11, and US probable use of high tech army in anti-terrorism campaign.
B000002U82|5.0|By 1973, Pink Floyd had come a long way from their original roots as an RnB band, becoming the creators of the avant-garde movement, creating rock music more layered and complex than anything that had ever gone before it. The evidence? Dark Side Of The Moon.<br />Often known as the album that was before its time, this masterpiece combines the magic of a few decades ago with the kind of innovation that we're getting these days, without these days as inspiration. Songs like Breathe, Time, Money and Us And Them combine Roger Waters' heartfelt lyrics with flowing, majesty, soul-shaking music.<br />A rich texture of instruments are used: saxophones are very effective on some tracks and sound effects are often used to impressive effect. There are some fantastic lyrics on the album: particularly Time and Eclipse. But the music is the real fantastic element.<br />Take Us and Them: my favorite song on the album and perhaps ever. It starts (although the album as a whole flows so that no songs really start anyway) with jazzy drums and saxophones with soothing vocals, then suddenly we get two humungous powerchords, the vocals belt out at about 8 different pitches, the saxophones run wild and the sound is absolutely ginormous.<br />Elsewhere there are ever-so-slight hints of reggae ('Money') and Soul ('The Great Gig in the Sky', the song which must contain the most oh's ever recorded).<br />Instrumentals On The Run and Any Colour You Like are solid, and closer Eclipse is a wonderful ending. This album is timeless. The proof? Both me and my dad like it.
0451203933|3.0|First, this nonfiction reads like a gripping action novel. Hard to put down. Better plan to lose sleep. Secondly, how could Bowden's analysis of the Mogadishu raid be more timely? Hope George Bush has read it. Hope the commanders are studying it. It is a textbook for opns going on now. Finally, Bowden achieves objectivity, detail, human interest, education, suspense, and relevance all in this compact paperback.<br />A former Ranger.
B00000IPAX|5.0|this is one of blinks best cds.  its best songs are all the small things, whats my abe again, anthem, and party song.<BR>you should buy it is cool
B000050XEI|5.0|If you liked any of Enya's previous albums, you'll like this one as well.  It doesn't stray far from her typical sound and focus, but there is still a fresh feel to it.
0316743305|5.0|This is a great book. It gives a behind-the-scenes look at the development of often secret aviation technology over the past 50 years. The book pulls no punches and tells the stories of failures as well as successes. Written in an easy to read style, the book contains enough technology for the most savvy reader. The book is full of technical and financial information plus humorous anecdotes about developing planes like the U2 spyplane, the F117A Stealth Fighter, the SR-71 Blackbird and others. It also covers the politics behind the sale and production of these aircraft. I could not put this book down! Highly reccommended.
0553106635|5.0|George R.R. Martin is apparently a master. This third book in the series follows suit of the other three, with intense, detailed plots. Martin takes you into each character's point of view with such skill that when you leave it, you can't wait to get back, and each character is like that! You see and feel each character's point of view even those who you thought were villians. I'm not sure anymore. The book features new PoV's YOu're going to love. The series is unpredictable, exciting, intense and masterful. 6 stars!
B00005NGAG|4.0|There is a myth in Hollywood that strong women characters have to be strong women (i.e. Erin Brockovich). What I liked about the film &quot;Beautiful Creatures&quot; is that the lead female characters, Petula and Dorothy, are not strong women initially. They have allowed themselves to be dominated by physically, mentally and sexually abusive men. Neither seem to be capable of helping themselves out of these relationships. But, ironically, they each have the ability to help the other. And in helping eachother, they find the strength that had been beaten out of them. Even though the film addresses a serious subject, I found it to be very funny without making light of the domestic abuse issue. Susan Lynch is terrific as Dorothy, the fed-up heroine who comes to the aid of a stranger and finds herself facing murder charges. And &quot;Mummy&quot; fans will hardly recognize Rachel Weisz from her most familiar role as &quot;Evie.&quot; Weisz is proving herself to be one of the most versatile actors making films today. There is an uninhibited quality about her performances that make every character she takes on totally believable. I definitely recommend this film for anyone who enjoys gritty humor and watching the underdogs win.
B00005KFUM|4.0|Muse likes to compose songs with surprises. Already the opener 'New Born' has a remarkable change of mood and uses an interesting and surprisingly successful instrumentation. Matthew Bellamy's lead vocals link it all to a great rock hymn. Of a unique style - the Muse style.<br />And it continues. The second track 'Bliss' is the other brightest higlight on 'Origin Of Symmetry', though it is the most straight-forward, least sophisticated composition on the album.<br />Generally, the most rocking and least artistically arranged songs are the best ones. The third example confirming this, is the very uncomplicated 'Plug In Baby'.<br />But Muse's trademark remains the creativity. The unique arrangements of most of the songs. That special and original soul which the bands succeeds in putting into rock music.<br />Sometimes Muse sounds quite a lot like Radiohead, especially the vocals, and especially on a song like 'Megalomania'. On this one, the vocals come through very beautifully and are even more beautifully supported by an almost church-like organ.<br />'Feeling Good' is a hit-suspectible rock song, with all the elements a 2001 rock song has to contain, and more. Its changing volume within its constant feel make it one of the best on 'Origin Of Symmetry'.<br />Every song has its own little surprise, like the bubbling rhythm and space synths on 'Space Dementia'. Or the synth beat on 'Citizen Erased' which sounds like the audio for a Commodore 64 generation computer game. The song also has some pretty abrupt but very well-succeeded and effectful mood changes. And there's the metallic feel on 'Micro Cuts', contrasted by its parodistically opera'esque vocals. Or the unusual gitar distortion on 'Darkshines'.<br />'Origin Of Symmetry' is a great album. It comes very close to five stars...
B000002URV|5.0|This first album of Enigma is one of their greatest and most distinctive in style. M.C. Curley managed to shake the world of New Age with his collaboration of Latin chants, french vocals, various instruments and very entrancing music. These qualities are particularily embodied in Sadness and Mea Culpa.
B00005NP04|5.0|I have never heard anybody sing like Martina McBride does. I was privileged enough to see her live show with Reba, and I was blown away. It's a rare performer who gets 4 standing ovations in the same show!<br />I read the other reviews for this album, and they describe the tracks themselves very well. My favorite has to be &quot;A Broken Wing.&quot; There is just such power and determination behind that one. With 18 full-length songs, this is almost like two albums for the price of one. If you don't have it yet, what are you waiting for? BIG HINT: This would make a great Christmas gift for somebody you love.   :):)
B00005O3VD|5.0|What a wonderful film &quot;Funny Girl&quot; is! From the opening chords of the overture to the final fade-out and exit music, it is a real treat for the eyes and ears!Wonderful direction, stunning costumes and sets and amazing performances all come together to make a truly memorable film. An added bonus of this particular incarnation is the widescreen presentation. This, coupled with a lovely, clear picture and great sound, probably make this the best available &quot;Funny Girl&quot; around. The bonus features are pretty good, too, particularly the two vintage featurettes which were made around the time that &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was filmed. All in all a terrific presentation which I would recommend to anyone, whether they like movie musicals or not!
B00005QIPH|2.0|This is a gritty little album. All of the tunes are bouncy numbers, leaning more towards Ramones, than Pistols. The lead singer is an Iggy/Jim hybrid, leaning more towards Iggy. Last-nite is a catchy tune, and could be a big hit for them if it gets airplay. The rest of the album gets repetitive. A band such as this, is much better served by EP's, since they wouldn't have to multiply the same garage tune X12. I think they should also cut the length of some of their songs, 4:37 is toooo long for Barely Legal. On another note, not to take away from the music, but I noticed the downplaying by the music press, and the band, of the song NYC cops. The EP was released stateside Sept. 4th , and we all know by now what happened just 7 days later. I wonder how this band feels about their song, after the fact? I don't see them pushing it, do they feel bad? Or do they just lack the balls to take the heat?
B00005KFUN|4.0|Muse likes to compose songs with surprises. Already the opener 'New Born' has a remarkable change of mood and uses an interesting and surprisingly successful instrumentation. Matthew Bellamy's lead vocals link it all to a great rock hymn. Of a unique style - the Muse style.<br />And it continues. The second track 'Bliss' is the other brightest higlight on 'Origin Of Symmetry', though it is the most straight-forward, least sophisticated composition on the album.<br />Generally, the most rocking and least artistically arranged songs are the best ones. The third example confirming this, is the very uncomplicated 'Plug In Baby'.<br />But Muse's trademark remains the creativity. The unique arrangements of most of the songs. That special and original soul which the bands succeeds in putting into rock music.<br />Sometimes Muse sounds quite a lot like Radiohead, especially the vocals, and especially on a song like 'Megalomania'. On this one, the vocals come through very beautifully and are even more beautifully supported by an almost church-like organ.<br />'Feeling Good' is a hit-suspectible rock song, with all the elements a 2001 rock song has to contain, and more. Its changing volume within its constant feel make it one of the best on 'Origin Of Symmetry'.<br />Every song has its own little surprise, like the bubbling rhythm and space synths on 'Space Dementia'. Or the synth beat on 'Citizen Erased' which sounds like the audio for a Commodore 64 generation computer game. The song also has some pretty abrupt but very well-succeeded and effectful mood changes.

B00005NW02|4.0|I'm 29 yrs old, i really don't like too much of the music that comes out now calling itself metal, but these guys are the one band now that RATM has called it quits that actually give metal a good name!   The Riffs come fast and furious and the lead singers odd eclectic voice fits great!  I think this band actually has a good chance to make some huge marks in the history of rock n roll/metal in the coming releases.  This is a very, very good CD, the only thing that i'm saying is that you can definetely get the feeling that they have alot more to give to people.  I love thrash, good thrash as much as anybody else, but these guys have talent that is beyond thrash.  Get in on them while they are still kinda still coming up because i think their will be a day when this is the band that everybody is talking about and being played on the local stations.  What the hell are you waiting for, if you like the biting guitar style that slayer is famous for then get out and buy this thing, you'll love it.   Thank you SOAD!  I thought metal was dead, and then this band proved me wrong
0792845668|5.0|The sequel to the first movie is as good as if not better than its predeccesor , with more laughs , more screams and hilarious moments. The plot follows Bill and Ted where they left off at the last movie , they are still no good at playing , however they are into the battle of the bands which gives them a chance to prove themselves and they have proposed to their ladies , until in comes denomolos a maniac from the future who wants our excellent heroes dead before they start a revolution against him , so he sends back to replica b and t's to kill them , which they do! there are other twists and turns along the way including a chess game with death , and a confrontation with their chilhood experiences which kinda scared me (especially when bill has to kiss his dead grandma ' that was non non non non non heinous !!!!!!' he exclaims in anger great lines include 'Bill were in heaven and we just mugged three people' and 'we love you ' which b and t say to the evil replicas 'fags!!!'comes the reply just before our heroes are murdered. I was surprised that the phone booth did not feature much , but this movie is about the afterlife , not timetravel , i would strongly recommend this movie especially if you have seen the first , the cast is great Alex Winter and Keanu do excellently. Joss Ackland is also good as the despicable nomolo de nomolos William Sadler is also hillarious as the inept grim reaper . In the words of oyr excellent friends 'PARTY ON DUDES!!!!!!!!!'
0783219598|5.0|I think that many kids know the fabolous story about the pig Babe and he his fantastic adventures on Hogget's farm in Australia, and it deserved the Oscar nomination for Best Picture in 1996 very well.<BR>The well acted animals, the human characters, like the crazy Hogget family, the timeless landscapes, and the beautyful music makes this an classic family movie nobody will forget, and for the kids who saw 'Charlotte's Web' (Many people in Scandinavia don't know about this movie, they should re-release it!), they will love this movie too!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|If you already own the older video release of this landmark animated feature, you should grab this new, superior edition. The previous restoration was commendable but artificial-looking; the image was cleaned but the result was too bright and antiseptic, robbing the film of its vintage, warm patina. (Imagine antique woodwork stripped and bleached and you'll get the idea.) This new DVD uses more recent technology to balance the contrast, brightness, color values, and soundtrack elements, and the video and audio technicians have done themselves proud.  There is a wealth of additional material, including rare reference footage, out-takes, session recordings, radio broadcasts, coming-attractions trailers, promotional films (including one assembled by Disney in two days for the RKO sales force, whose own short is also included), and recollections by those involved in the original production. There are also closed-captions and an alternate version in French (fascinating in itself, with superb dubbing). The &quot;magic mirror&quot; serves as the user guide, directing the viewer to the various menu features. (And if you don't follow his instructions, the mirror scolds you with a few pointed remarks!) This very enjoyable DVD is truly &quot;the fairest of them all,&quot; a magnificent showcase for a timeless classic.

B000009RC2|5.0|Where to begin....This has to be my favorite album I have heard in my short life (18 years so far).  People talk about Page and Clapton (I won't touch Hendrix) as being the greatest guitar players, but c'mon.  John McLaughlin blows them out of the water.  Pick up one of his more recent CDs for ample evidence.  John also knew how to choose his band.  Damn!  Jan Hammer (keys) and Jerry Goodman (violin) could rip out solos like no toromorrow.  Rick Laird (bass) was a fairly sparse player, yet you know he can play anything, and Billy Cobham (drums) is nearly as much a master of his instrument as McLaughlin is.  <BR>The songs on here are all extremely strong.  They all possess a raw, gritty production quality which emphasizes the sheer power that these musicians were performing at. The opener, Meeting of the Spirits, is my absolute favorite song from any album, any artist, anywhere. Period.  It combines a screaming melody with amazing counter melodies and harmonic activity, not to mention the  excited rhythm holding it all together.  The next track, Dawn, is a welcome relief from the incredible tension of the first song.  But it goes right back up with track 3, the Noonward Race, which shows some of John's most inspired soloing.  A Lotus on Irish Streams is the only acoustic track, not to mention the only track that is somewhat relaxing.  Again, Billy's opening 9/8 drum riff lets you know you're in for more high energy fun, which is fully delivered in Vital Transformations.  The Dance of Maya carries a complex bluesy sound on top of a seemingly constantly changing rhythm (in 10/4).  You know, You know shows the band flexing their muscles at a slightly lower energy level, which is followed by them doing the same at full energy level in Awakening, which shows the ability of each member better than any other song on the album.  For all this technical wizardry, they still could produce a simple melody that'll be stuck in your head all day (Vital Transformations!).  This is amust for jazz, fusion, and ALL rock fans.  Buy this!
B000002MP2|5.0|This album got me into Greenday. I lent it off a friend, and the rest is history. The songs combine great music with witty lyrics, and my faveourite song on the album has to be Longview, which has some great drum/guitar combos. Basket case is a nice song too. I don't dislike any of the songs on the album, which is a rarity for me. I would reccommend this album to any music fan, whether you're into punk or not.
B00004XOWM|1.0|For the love of God any youngster who loves this trash...WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE. Is it just me or is this exactle what answers my question about the dumbening down of Americas youth. This band is nothing but pure garbage. When I borrowed this CD from a classmate about a year ago just after this album came I laughed at the stupidity of the content of what came out of my boombox. Hot Dog was so stupid I couldn't help but laugh at Fred Durst for making a complete and total fool out of himself. It's also funny how a band tries to put the F word into a song and yell it over 50 times in just under 4 minutes of endless noise. It's so sad that our culture is becoming low-life when worthless bands like them are shoving this garbage down the throat of America. There is nothing good to say about this really BAD CD. I have never heard such musical vomit in my life.<br />DO NOT call me some 50 year old bald man because I,m 19 years old and I am appalled at the fact that many 13-16 year olds paying more attention on how 'cool' they are by using obscenity than how smart they really are. Well what I can say is that music is really dead if this is what the future holds for our countrys music scene.<br />Buy Roland Orzabals Tomcats Screaming Ourside(One of the best pop albums I,ve heard in years), Bjorks Vespertine, or anything by Afro Celt Sound System. Bloody hell even Korn does better than this.
B00003CXA3|5.0|The French connection i'll have to say is one of my all time favorite movies. Great acting, Great story, Great script, Great cast and crew...and One hell of a movie. You know I watsh this great movie over and over again and discover myself stunned to death that Hackman, not a well known acter at the time put on this fabulous preformance. Infact I take back my five star review,and give a six star review whoever disagrees is not a real man.

B000001G1E|5.0|Five stars are barely adequate to describe how monumental this box set truly is. With seventy tracks spanning thirty years of prime James Brown material, you will be exploring the offerings here for a very long time. I bought this box way back in 1993 and I'm STILL absorbing everything that it has to offer.<br />With the tracks presented in chronological order, you can track the development over time not just of the JB sound (blues to R&amp;B to funk to classic soul), but you can also follow the history of entire branches of popular music in which the JB influence looms large. Disc one covers the early years when James was storming the R&amp;B and blues circuits with some of the most intense new sounds those scenes had ever encountered. He invents funk near the end of disc one, and even says so himself in the liner notes, where he credits the long-lost &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (heard here in its original form for the first time) as his funk songwriting breakthrough.<br />After getting the funk off the ground, discs two and three are a non-stop, relentless collection of piledriving funk grooves. These two discs will rock any party without apologies, and I don't care if you dig the funk or not. James brought on board the funkiest, tightest, and most relentless bands available (especially in the 1969-71 period) to create this incredible music that has been a huge influence on all subsequent funk, not to mention hip-hop and large chunks of the rock world. The party slows down a bit with disc four, in which you can see that James was getting past his prime, although there a few late-period surprises like &quot;The Payback&quot; and &quot;Get Up Offa That Thing.&quot; By this point it was natural for James to slow down on the creation of new sounds, and focus on his current duties as a non-stop live attraction for his ravenous followers.<br />Another worthy part of this box set is the extensive liner notes, which include exhaustive chart listings and historical info, and an acceptable James Brown bio. There is also much good info on the more important members of JB's bands, like Bobby Byrd, Clyde Stubblefield, Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and the teenaged Bootsy Collins (who would later single-handedly redefine the bass guitar as an instrument in his work with Parliament/Funkadelic and as a solo artist). Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go back to getting my mind blown by this set. Like I said, I'm still digging it after all these years.an acceptable James Brown bio.

B00005ASOI|5.0|&quot;Suspiria&quot; is arguably Dario Argento's best film.  Although his films are not known primarily for their narrative cohesion, &quot;Suspiria&quot; is the one that makes the most narrative sense... Jessica Harper captures the right balance of sweetness and strength as Susy Banyon, an American ballet student who enrolls at the Tann Akademie, a prestigious ballet school in rural Germany.  From the very first moment of her arrival (in the film's first memorable sequence: a long,atmospheric taxi ride through the nightttime rain, made even more sinister by the Goblins' now-classic score), she is plunged into terror.  She witnesses a mysterious girl rushing from the school, who is later murdered in the film's second memorable (and much-discussed) sequence.  As she finally gets settled into the school, Susy meets and gets to know several characters:  Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the school's diva vice-directress; Ms. Tanner (Alida Valli), the stern and butch head teacher; and Sarah (Stefania Casini), as a high-strung fellow student who befriends Susy and may know more about the school than she is telling.  After the school pianist is attacked and killed by his own seeing-eye dog(another memorable segment), Susy and Sarah begin to suspect something is amiss at the Academy.  When Sarah vanishes (following a harrowing chase through the school's attic by a mysterious hooded figure in yet another terrifying sequence), Susy really begins to worry and delves into the school's past, uncovering stories of witchcraft and occult rites.  The remainder of the film rachets up the suspense as Susy finds herself alone in the school while all the other students are gone attending a ballet.  This leads to a confrontation with the Academy's directress, the head witch herself.  If this film has a flaw, it's the way it ends so abruptly.   But it is a minor quibble considering everything that has come before.  All in all, &quot;Suspiria&quot; is a collection of terrifying sequences heldtogether by a solid-enough plotline, Argento's unique visuals, and the scariest score ever.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I wasn't really sure if I wanted to see this movie, since I thought it was supposed to me a &quot;kid's&quot; movie, but I was really glad that I did.  This movie was hilarious!<br />Shrek is a big ogre who is wanted dead by the king.  The king orders all of the &quot;fairy tale&quot; creatures out of his kingdom, so they end up at Shrek's.  He wants them off his land, so he approaches the king to have them removed.<br />Without giving everything away, I will close now.  But I will say that Shrek ends up going on an adventure that he will never forget to rescue a princess.<br />Just remember, this is a movie for everyone, not specifically children.  Overly-cautious parents should view the movie before letting their children view it.<br />Enjoy!
B00003CXAA|3.0|While it's a good thing that the three movies have been released in DVD format. I expected much more. In the early '80 NBC ran the GF1 and GF2 in cronological order with all of the out takes. The movie started with young Vito in Sicily and ended with Micheal making a deal with the Sicilian mob over the heroin business started by Solozzo and Barzini. This was what I was expecxting with this DVD, all of the out takes incorporated into the movie.<br />I felt that this offering was simply Francis Ford Copolla rasing money to keep his wine vinyard. He took the three movies, put them in DVD format, dug up some old interviews, a family tree with descriptions of some of the members, slapped it together in a package with a large price tag. Some of the desciptions had major mistakes. Like they say Michael Killed Solozzo and the police captian in a &quot;Brooklyn&quot; resturant. Sorry that should have been a Bronx resturant.<br />I wish they would have released the NBC movie instead. I think the name of that movie was &quot;Mario Puzzo's the Godfather a novel for TV&quot;, and for us dye hard fans of these great movies that would have fit the bill. What they released made me feel as though I was taken advantage of. Just when I thought I had enough they pull me back in&quot;.
0790729628|2.0|I saw the original theatrical release, and when I heard there was a &quot;director's cut,&quot; I imagined that there would be lots of more scenes from the &quot;deleted&quot; ones, etc., but definitely no what they did. The voice over adds a great deal of understanding that it is needed for a better grasp of the motives of the characters. The so called &quot;phony ending&quot; is a definite absolute requirement for psychological resolution and hope. This release at least should had offered both versions. I own the original on tape, and so hard to get, but VHS is dying. I was hopping for the DVD version, but it does not look is going to be one.
B00005LMBK|5.0|i'm a fan of hard rock and metal (REAL metal - none of that Linkin' Park, Staind and other mainstream ....), but this was a nice turn. It wasn't really heavy, and when i got this Cd, i really needed to har something that kind of calmed me down. it was a nice middle ground for a change. my favorite track is Re-Hash, and my other favorites are Starshine, Drum + Bass, 19/2000, and Rock the House.<br />I don't quite see the hype in Clint Eastwood, though. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good song - it's just that some of the other ones are SO much better!
0140182829|5.0|I don't have much to add to the other favorable reviews here.  Despite his premature death and limited output, Alain-Fournier's legacy lives on, most notably in the novels of John Fowles.  For a contemporary American slant on similar themes, try Rand Johnson's new novel &quot;Arcadia Falls&quot;.
B000002W5J|4.0|&quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; is one of the 1960's albums that never seems to grow tired. With each listening, there seems to be a verse or a sound that resonates with current events. The Grace Slick classic &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; ignites the album and still sounds fresh and fiery. The hypnotic &quot;Today&quot; is one of the lesser-known tracks but Marty Balin's lead vocal is perfectly suited to the psychedelic music. The instrumental &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot; does'nt hold up as well but the next track, &quot;White Rabbit&quot; is the highlight of the album. Grace Slick's powerful, relentless vocal builds atop the bass and guitar chords to a screaming climax. The only flaw of this album -  and it is major - ithe sound quality. There is notable suppression  and hiss. A Remaster is sorely needed.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Rarely am I excited to watch a movie for a second time after having JUST seen it. But Memento has broken my general rule.<br />As a college student I'm being exposed to a wide variety of new and intriging information. Among the pool of knowledge is anterograde amnesia, which Leonard (played by Guy Pierce), the main character of Memento, suffers from. He is no longer able to make new memories due to a traumatic brain injury. But the movie isn't just that. It's shot BACKWARDS. You learn Leonard's story slowly, just as he might feel. You see a scene and are left with a ton of questions. The next scene backtracks, showing you the event previous to the scene you just saw. It ends as it begins to trail into the beginning. It's just marvelous. Over lying the main story is scenes shown in black and white. Exactly WHAT is going on in those black and white scenes is yet another mystery and wonderful entanglement of Memento. There's plenty of twists and turns as more and more is shown to you. Who to trust is a big issue and I was on my toes trying to guess exactly what would come next. When the movie wraps up and all the frayed ends are connected for you, the amazing twist at the end leaves you wanting to re-watch the whole thing right then.<br />Leonard can't make new memories. Imagining what that world must be like, because it is quite a different world from those who can make new memories, is quite impossible. The wonderful writers, actors, and directors of this film have made that world possible. The disjointed fluidness of the film truly make it feel as though you're caught up in Leonard's world. I know I personally can't wait to get caught up in it again and catch more details I might have missed the first time.
B0000029DD|3.0|Jeff Buckley has garnered massive priase from critics and fans alike. Much of it is deserved, but much is not.<br />Buckley has one of the most powerfully emotive voices I've ever heard. It is a light, clean, and high tenor, and he shows notable control, filling every word with tremendous feeling. His barren interpretation of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' is an emotional masterpiece, the finest cover of this much-remade song I have ever heard. His guitar-playing is also varied and effective.<br />His songwriting, however, leaves something to be desired. While he pens several good lines, an equal number of them are inscrutable stuff like &quot;Born again from the rhythm screaming down from heaven / ageless, ageless and I'm there in your arms&quot; (from 'Mojo Pin'). Melodies seem to come and go as they please, and the production, while adequate, is fairly uninteresting. Buckley's interpretive talents are wasted on his own material.<br />Jeff Buckley is, to me, much like Enrico Caruso. Like Buckley, Caruso had uniquely powerful and moving voice that could salvage mediocre material but, when applied to great songs, produced authoritative works that still leave listeners in awe. Caruso was perhaps the greatest singer of his time, but he was wise enough to recognize his own finitude and chose to only bring life to the works of others, not try to create his own. Buckley, also a great talent, is best when he follows that same course.
B000002KDS|5.0|This is the last album that Alice Cooper made before he sold his soul for Rock `n' Roll &amp; Teeney bopper superstardom, with \\"Schools Out\\", in 1972. Later on, of course, he had to pay the reaper, give up his high flying Rock `n' Roll life style, put the demon alcohol behind him and take up golf, but that's another avenue we can descend down on another trip.<br /> The opening volley, \\"Under My Wheels\\", comes ripping out of your music maker with its machine gun guitar intro and barking vocals, Alice is straining at the leash right from the off.<br /> Second number up is \\"Be My Lover\\", with the opening lyrics of \\"She struts into the room, and I don't know her, but with a magnifying glass I just thought I'd look her over\\", very P.C. Alice!<br /> The music takes a dramatic upward spiral with the exquisite \\"Halo of Flies\\". This twists and turns as the plot unfolds leaving you in little doubt that the young man formally known as Vincent Furnier has indeed been taken over by a 17th century witch called Alice Cooper and clearly gone completely off his rocker.<br /> The productions of Bob Ezrin was essential to the band at this time, keeping it clean and tight, but not losing any of the sweat and sleaze.<br /> Alice then drools all over you on \\"Desperado\\". This is followed by two up-tempo, stonesy-keefed-up songs that drag you into the pit of Alice's world. Never has there been such a sinister piece of music written like \\"Dead Babies\\". The repetitive bass lines grab you full frontal and batter their way into your head. The demented glee with which Alice rants the lines lets you know that these are indeed very sick beings. With the outrage that pours out at the end of this, you feel that it is very justifiable. Justice is done in the album's final dirge with the gloom ridden gothic rock of the title track, with its wailing lost souls and final guillotine chop as Alice is sucked down to hell in a bucket.<br /> By taking Killer out on the road, Alice Cooper became a rock phenomenon.  It was one of the most provocative and original live shows in the annals of rock music and has never been equaled. It set the standards for humour, debauchery, horror and flamboyant showmanship. Concert theatrics included cuddling a boa constrictor, throwing live chickens into the audience, and simulated executions of hanging by the gallows. With the music from Killer, Alice had the means to blow everybody else away, spot lighting the shock rock that has made Alice Cooper one of the most influential acts in rock history.<br /> \\"We are not worthy.\\"<br />Mott the Dog.as one of the most provocative and original live shows in the annals of rock music and has never been equaled.

6300214710|4.0|I just saw this movie 4 the 1st time this weekend, I liked it a lot, it was on right after the movie sixteen candles, so it reminds me of that movie since the main girl is also in that movie too, anyway, this is a great movie. Its an older one about a girl who is poor and not very popular who has a popular rich guy crushing on her.

B000002KCI|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. If I could only have one Neil Young album, this would be the one. Any album that contains &quot;Danger Bird,&quot; &quot;Barstool Blues,&quot; &quot;Cortez the Killer,&quot; &quot;Stupid Girl,&quot; and &quot;Don't Cry No Tears&quot; is could practically be titled &quot;The Best of Neil Young and Crazy Horse.&quot;<BR>Beyond that, I can't add much to what everyone's already said about this extraordinary piece of music.<br />The only problem with &quot;Zuma&quot; is that it's a rather short album. In a dream world, this will someday be reissued on CD with outtakes from Neil's legendary archives. There must be tracks from the same sessions that deserve to be heard. Maybe it's greedy to want this &quot;enhanced&quot; version of &quot;Zuma,&quot; but one can always hope.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is my favorite Dylan album next to Desire.  The adorable songs &quot;Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Floater&quot; and &quot;Bye and Bye&quot; struck me first and it is amazing how beautiful Dylan can make that growl of a voice.<BR>Upon further listenings, the more intense and lyrical songs began to work on me.  Songs like &quot;Mississippi&quot;, Highwater&quot; and the hilarious &quot;Po' Boy&quot;.  Again, it is probably strange to hear this, but Dylans voice has never sounded better.  Time Out of Mind bummed me out and sort of turned me off to his &quot;New Voice&quot;  but this album set me to rights.  <br />Lets hope Dylan is crafting another trilogy like the one he did in the seventies with BOTT, Desire, and Street Legal. Best album in years
0767802470|5.0|This is a film American audiences need to be more familiar with, because it had a tremendous influence on later films such as U-571. For those not familiar with foriegn films, this piece is not only long but also develops in a non-american fashion. The events move almost like the waves of the ocean themselves. While it is a movie about that battle of the atlantic, it is apolitical; your enlightened girlfriend probably wouldn't mind it. And thank God for one of the few movies not to demonize the German military! We all know the Nazis were an evil empire, but for that matter so were the Soviets and Japanese! Anyway, this work will take you through a long yet rewarding journey; and personally, it was the ending itself that earns this movie an additional star for me. Not that I like unhappy endings per se, but it was such a refreshing (and realistic) relief from the Hollywood formula. Try it!
B00005MKFD|2.0|&quot;Landing on Water&quot; is a very strange album, even by Neil Young's standards. Who else would follow an old-time country album (&quot;Old Ways&quot;) with an often cheesy synth-pop album? But it was hardly a commercial move, as there's plenty of screaming lead guitar from Neil, and Steve Jordan's drums are too snare-heavy and loud in the mix to be radio-friendly. At times, it works. But most of the music sounds terribly dated now in the way that most synth-based '80s stuff does, although Neil threw in just enough of his usual rawness and quirkiness that it's still kind of interesting to hear.<br />And, for the most part, this is a pretty weak batch of songs from Neil, full of trite sentiments, obvious lyrics, and even the occasional nod to the MTV generation (which meant something different in '86 than it does now).<br />A big exception is &quot;Hippie Dream,&quot; a scathing jab at Neil's peers (especially ex-bandmate David Crosby) who succumbed to nihilistic excess and addiction while resting on past laurels. In contrast, moving forward restlessly (and wrecklessly) is Neil's thing: &quot;just because it's over for you doesn't mean it's over for me&quot; is the key line. This song is a standout, a forgotten NY classic, really. Interestingly, it's the track where the synthesizers are least distracting.<br />But there's not much else here you'd want to go back to. &quot;Landing on Water&quot; is an amusing listen once in a while, but far less interesting overall than his better-known (and more controversial) synth-based album, &quot;Trans.&quot;
B00005LC1H|4.0|One of the best shows ever, this DVD was nearly done in by the awful director's commentary.<br />If you want to hear an old Englishman nose-breathe for six hours, listen to the director's commentary track.  The man breathes heavily, not saying a word for minutes at a stretch, then says one or two things, then breathes again.<br />Worse, it becomes patently obvious the director put no thought or effort into it.  He has not seen the shows for years, and didn't bother to give them a look before doing the commentary, and so many of his all-too-rare comments are along the lines of &quot;I don't even remember doing that scene.&quot;  In &quot;Gourmet Night&quot;, he doesn't even remember what Basil had gotten the duck switched for at Andre's restaurant until someone off-mike reminds him it's a trifle!<br />Frustrating, pointless, and embarrassing.<br />However, there is much good in the DVD.  The shows are themselves great.  The interviews with John Cleese and Michael Sachs are very interesting, indeed, and there's a mini-documentary about Torquay that is worth a look.<br />A couple of other niggles:  the interviewer for Michael Sachs digs into his ear with his finger on-camera, and the English subtitles are chock full of misspellings and typos.<br />A poor effort for the special features, but if you get the DVD at least the resolution will let you see a few things you couldn't with the videotapes--like Polly's satiric drawing of Mr. Fawlty as a junkyard with a collar and tie under it.<br />Only the show itself gets this DVD 4 stars.  Don't buy it for the special features, as except for the interviews with the cast members, they're pretty awful.
6300248550|5.0|This version of Jane Eyre is simply AMAZING! If you haven't seen it already, you should because there will never be another like it. This four-hour adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's novel hardly leaves out the crucial parts that are often left out and overlooked by the other versions I've seen. For the fans of the novel, you will find that this movie includes many lines straight from the novel. You may be surprised on how easy to follow this movie is.  I have watched the movie with the book in hand to help answer any questions I may have had. <br />The dashing Timothy Dalton fits the part of Edward Fairfax Rochester, almost too well, except for one thing; he is FAR too handsome for the Rochester spoken of in the novel! :) Despite this, he brings the Rochester created in my mind to life, because with every line he spoke, Timothy brought a fiery magic to his character. &quot;He was born to play the role,&quot; some have said.  I must say, I agree. I have watched this movie many times over, and I hardly find a fault to his performance. I think that if I was closer to Tim's age, that I would find my self-swooning over his fine features and magnetic accent. Accents are so sexy! Come on ladies, don't you agree?! :)<br />Yes, I could go on forever talking about him, but, now I must move on to Zelah Clarke, who although may seem too old to play the part of Jane Eyre, shared a great chemistry with her co-star.  Their onscreen chemistry is too magnificent to put into words.  Some have said she was not \\"plain enough\\" to play the role, I agree that she was pretty, but I think she fit her role just as well as Timothy. I hope that she is well remembered for playing the part of the plain, quakerish governess for decades to come.  After all, She deserves to be remembered because of her acting talents. They both [Dalton &amp; Clarke] have immortalized the classic story that touches on the idea that Love is blind. Love knows no age limits.<br />There are few things I could find wrongwith the movie...some things were missing. I think that if you read the novel, you'll see. Some elements were added or subtracted from the overall plot. No, I won't give away anything more. You'll have to read the novel and see the movie yourself. Then, please email me, and let's talk. :)<br />In conclusion, this truly is an old-fashioned romance movie, and the settings and supporting characters add to the incredible adaptation from the novel to the movie. Bravo, BBC!
B00003CXXS|3.0|Well, its the 3rd installation of the Jurassic Park series.  It definitely ain't great.  But its not bad, either.<br />This film is obviously not meant to be plot driven, but that's ok.  Chances are you won't like this movie when you first see it, but it will grow on you once you watch it a second time.  The special effects are pretty good, if a little dated, and the action is intense and non-stop.  Sam Neil reprising the role as Grant is a definite plus.  Not a great movie, but a fun movie.<br />The DVD edition is actually rather great.  There are tons of features that make it well worth your money.  The collectible booklet is actually a huge pull out of dinosaur size comparisons and movie facts.  The Special Features menu is huge, with 'Behind the Scenes' documentaries, theatrical trailers, Cast and Crew Information, and a bunch of other extra goodies.  While the movie isn't anything spectacular, if you liked the first two, you'll probably still like this film despite the inconsistencies and plot holes.  The plethora of extras make up for this, and overall its a pretty good DVD to add to your collection.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I first heard this album 24 years ago, after I left school with a pile of tapes made for me by a friend.  I knew it had a strong reputation with the school cognoscenti, and yet I still virtually ignored it.  I blame my crummy cassette deck.  Listening now in 2001 to the gloriously re-mastered CD, I realise what a treat I've been missing.<br />Jeff Beck has always been much better appreciated in the States than in his home country.  In the UK, we know him largely for the 60's nostalgia singalong single, 'Hi Ho Silver Lining'.  Play that next to BLOW BY BLOW and you can only conclude that either his has been a hugely under-acknowledged talent or he has been the master of reinventing himself.<br />Here he suddenly invades jazz-rock territory and asserts an immediate claim to the crown.  There are touches of Return to Forever's Al diMeola, but the benchmark album for Beck's sound here is Larry Coryell on Eleventh House's LEVEL ONE, a remarkable LP which has never been reissued on CD.<br />Beck is first and foremost an instrumentalist rather than a composer.  Having decided on Beatles producer George Martin for this solo LP, it was no great surprise that he should end up doing a Lennon/McCartney number as well as a couple of Stevie Wonder songs.  The band throughout is Beck on guitars, Richard Bailey (not Billy Cobham) on drums, Phil Chenn on bass, and the amazingly versatile Max Middleton on keyboards -- he was also a linchpin on John Martyn's GLORIOUS FOOL and Chris Rea's ON THE BEACH, for example.  My favourite tracks are the two Wonder songs, 'Thelonius' and the soulful 'Cause We've Ended as Lovers', but the band's playing is outstanding throughout.  It's extraordinary that they existed for this one LP.<br />As the other reviewers say, you have to get both this and WIRED.
B000056K04|4.0|I loved the new CD &quot;Everyday&quot; by Dave Matthews Band. But then again i am a hard core fan and would love it if he came out with renditions of nursury school songs. The sound is unique and not the same old Dave. He has some new instruments and some of the songs take some time to get used to. I wouldnt reccomend this for a first time Dave listener but die hard fans should enjoy. Thanks
B00004THAY|5.0|Well this cd certainly has more fans than not. It is just so hard to believe that even the small minority here can have given it 1 star, but like the old adage goes, &quot;You can't please all of the people all of the time&quot;. One star though, is an insult to these two greats. This is an excellent blues album and should please most fans of either artist. The songs are all great, not a bad one amongst them. I, for one, love this album, and recommend it highly.
0062502182|3.0|A retelling of a very old story that did not quite live up to its promise.  A sweet little book, probably more appropriate for a 13-14 year old than an adult.  It's a quick read...a diversion for a Saturday afternoon, perhaps.
B00005KFUN|5.0|An unusual, unsettlingly intense voice, intriguing, intelligent lyrics, an always original and unequalled sound...you've got Muse in a nutshell. Athough perhaps less intimate &amp; spontaneous than their first album, Origin of Symmetry shines by its homogenic feeling and brilliant originality. <BR>And yes, there's much more in here than the two first singles &quot;Newborn&quot; and &quot;Bliss&quot; that are exhaustively played on TV. &quot;Citizen Erased&quot; is a monument in itself, easily the high point of the album, and worth your time, and &quot;Megalomania&quot;, an eerie powerful piece, finishing off with an impressive organ finale!<BR>Certainly not least important among good reasons to buy this album, singer Matt Bellamy's voice is pure intensity: imagine a mix of Billy Idol, Jeff Buckley and Freddie Mercury and perhaps you've got the good idea!<BR>And the way this guy gasps for breath in between phrases gives me the goosebumps... <BR>You've got to love the fact he's giving it his all, often indulging in a screeching-screaming fest at the end of some songs, where his voice and the sounds he pulls out of his guitar are undistinguishable (I'm referring to the &quot;oo,oo-waaah&quot;s, &quot;ooh&quot;, and the &quot;wooaahhhh&quot;s which are actually figure on the lyrics) ! ;)<BR>Watch out for the really nice transitions between songs. This album is seemlessly and continuously intense from start to finish, so smooth &amp; well thought out that the 52 minutes of music pass by almost too fast and it has you pressing play again to get prolong the Bliss.<BR>Some last teasers: Watch out for &quot;Space Dementia&quot; which includes a greater sampler of singer/composer/writer/guitar player Matt Bellamy's virtuoso piano-playing (what can this guy NOT do?). They also used the sound of Matt's jeans ziper to close off this song. Are you intrigued yet?
B000002NHN|5.0|CD was a gift that I treasure deeply.  Marco Polo is an all time favorite.  Very spiritual and takes the listener on a beautiful journey.
0743216458|2.0|It is like most other books about WAR, the author does not follow<BR>the factual events, but tells a good story.<BR>The 101st was one of the last Amertican units to reach the Eagle's Nest. The 15th Inf. Regt. 3rd Inf.Div. (Audie Murphy's unitt) was the first American unit to reach it and a French unit at the same time. The 101st came in much later, but joined in the party or what was left.

B00003CX5P|4.0|Let's get this out of the way: the deleted scenes are NOT worth buying this DVD.  Each of the deleted scenes deserved to be deleted from the movie, whereas other scenes everyone wanted to see (such as Qui Gon and Maul fighting on the ramp of Queen Amidala's ship) are never even hinted at.  (In case you didn't know, the scene I just mentioned takes place when Qui Gon jumps up to the ship after scuffling with Maul on Tatooine; in the original, he's followed by Maul, where another melee takes place on the ramp with Qui Gon giving Maul a force push after Maul tries to Tomahawk Qui Gon, a move Maul later gives to Obi Wan that leaves Obi Wan hanging over the energy reactor shoot in the final battle).  Of all the scenes to include, Lucas gives us more Jar Jar!  WHEN DOES THE HURTING STOP?????  <br />Okay, now that I have that out of my system . . . it's a good DVD.  Even after watching it, I'd still buy it.  If tradition holds, the second movie of the trilogy will be the gem of the series (we all know Empire was what made the first Star Wars trilogy what it is today), which means there's still hope of redemption from Jar Jar.  I say: keep the faith.  Like A New Hope (the very first one), The Phantom Menace will hopefully prove to be a &quot;warm up&quot; for Lucas for better things to come.
630512762X|4.0|I'd say one of the best things in this movie is that we can se both Cage &amp; Travolta as a good guy and bad guy. They show how good actors they are! If you like action movies, this one is the one to see! If fact, some people I know were even tired to see the shooting at each other, but (hey!) it's John Woo isn't it???<BR>Worth to buy if you like pure action movies.
B000003TAR|5.0|1 word- nasty. That about covers this album. Personally i think its there best. Even though nevermind is on par with this in greatness, i prefer this alubm for its harder, angrier, fedup sense of style. One of the best albums ever made. I dont know how to stress ebough how good this cd is. Especially like the last track, in a way its sort of a sad goobye from Kurt.
630428540X|5.0|Fantastic! I loved the story, and Travolta was absolutely brilliant playing George! I think that this movie teaches us a lot about life and relationships with people around us. It went straight to my heart! Some of my friends didn't like it, but as far as i'm concerned, BUY IT! It's a must!
B00003CWL6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Lots of great acting and an interesting plot.  The DVD is excellent with a great commentary track with the directory Sam Mendes.  He really explains his craft and this was espacially interesting as this was his directorial debut.
630398021X|4.0|First time i've seen this movie, I thought it was never going to end. But then again, I watched it a second time and I actually enjoyed it! It's based on a really unusual type of script. What is bad is that we can predict quite easily how the movie is going to end... But all things considered, it's worth to have if you like sci-fi merged with suspense.
630529142X|2.0|The Waterboy was greatly hyped, but, in my opinion, was greatly disappointing.  I think the reason the Waterboy was such a big box office hit is that it came after the Wedding Singer which was a much better movie and many people thought they would get more of the same with the Waterboy.  I can only imagine that the hard-core Adam Sandler fans would really like this movie.

014028009X|5.0|I had this book in pile to be read and figured I needed a bit of humor at the time so I started this book. From the start of book it had me laughing. I love the way the story flowed and how it told the story of a woman who is very much like a lot of woman I know. Single, overweight, and a chain smoker.<br />I wished at times I could be right there with Bridget in the story and be living where she lived and meeting the people. I love her friends and of couse Mark, Daniel and her parents and all of there friends.<br />I can't wait to start on the next book and will most likly be laughing just as hard as I did with this one.
B00003CXSP|1.0|One gets the impression that Hollywood just had to cash in on the &quot;Dr Hannibal Lecter&quot; aura and hence the forced sequel. It tragic that Ridley Scott had to waste his movie making talent in making this rather tame sequel that relies more on gore than on story telling and a tight screenplay to revive the protagonists.<br />Dr Lecter is re-born so to say (i.e has come out of hibernation) suddenly as fine arts professor some where in Italy. He is on the FBI's 10 most wanted list of criminals and walks around Italy and indeed in US as if he is taking a stroll in Central Park ! During the course of the movie Dr Lecter manages to leave Italy, return back to the US, and as part of the climax, leave US and presumably return back to Italy without even a smattering of a disguise to hide his identity - which suggests that customs and immigration officials at both Italy and the US airports are brain dead. I mean we are talking about the FBI's 10 most wanted men here - not some petty criminal indicted for drunk driving !!<br />Ms Clarice Starling too has not progressed to far ahead in life and seems to attract bad luck within her job with FBI just like moths to honey. Rather unnecessarily and just to suit the plot she has to undergo demotion for a botched up job with hardly any chance for Clarice to state her side of the story. And why the hell has she been reassigned on the job to track Lecter - I dont know.<br />A few sequences in the movie that are essentially gross and do nothing to add to the story line other than pander to the lovers of horror are:<br />1. Mason Verger's face<br />2. The pig sequence<br />3. The climax dinner sequence<br />4. The rather philosophical exchange of dialogues - so that one gets the impression that one is watching a class act movie or what wud seem like a belated attempt to cover the weak script with unnecessarily tedious and philosophical exchanges.<br />Other than the gore, the plot seems so loose. Look closely and you will note that there is *ABSOLUTELY NO REASON* to a make this movie other than maybe fool a few people and make a quick buck before the other's catch on. There are so many loopholes and other problems that I can go on and on and on...but am quite bored of typing. No wonder Jodie Foster dropped out of this one !<br />All in all a *VERY* disappointing movie.

6305627401|2.0|The only reason to watch South Park is to see Cartman get ... off. He does so in \\"Bigger, Longer and Uncut\\" but not enough for my taste. Too much time is spent on stupid muscial numbers and a hopelessly unfunny plot. Sadaam Hussein and Satan are lovers? Oooohh... tee-hee!! Big Gay Al is big and ... and does a Broadway number at the end? What a kneeslapper! Gimme a break. It's humor for twelve-year olds.<br />Aside from Cartman getting zapped everytime he swears, there's nothing funny here (well, I admit.... making fun of how Canadians talk is pretty funny). Nothing satirical (unless Parker and Stone are satirizing how South Park pushed the limits of animated foul-mouthed kids... If so... whatever guys. Nice waste of celluloid). Don't bother with this one.
B00005LQ04|1.0|Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Read all the reviews about how great and scary the movie was and considered buying it based on them alone (but rented it first to make sure).  Well, I am still kicking myself 2 days later for wasting 2 hours to watch it.  Gory?  Scary?  How about embarassing and ridiculous.  Acting was dreadful, plot was horrible, and I caught myself wanting to turn it off 30 minutes into it.  One of the best horror movies?  The horror is that I actually spent money to rent it.  This movie does not even come close to horror classics such as The Exorcist or Halloween.  Toss this one in the category bin of:  outgoing garbage.
B000002BQK|4.0|Well, what to say. I WAS a Mariah fan in the beginning. I found her music to be rich and deep. With her debut album &quot;Mariah&quot; I found myself pleasantly surprised with the richness of her voice and depth of her songs..in an era of Milli Vanilli, Hammer and Vanilla Ice...(we wont go there), her music was something new and fresh. BUT... in the last few years, I asked myself &quot;Mariah,what happened&quot;? I really stopped liking her music about the time of &quot;Dream Lover&quot;..then I stopped listening to her music all together! <br />Sometime later...&quot;Honey&quot; came on the radio..I said &quot;Wow&quot; she has finally come back! I love this album it has really great moments..for me &quot;Breakdown&quot; with Bone-Thugz and &quot;The Roof&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Honey&quot; I really enjoyed this album.<br />I mean face it..our fav artists will not always go with what we want them to do, but, with what feels right and good for them. I am glad she is taking risks with her music..acting and so forth. I mean, if Janet, Madonna, and other Divas can do it..why cant she? <br />I only wish Mariah would not show so much of herself all of the time. She is a beautiful woman..and midrifts are ok once in a while..even Madonna at her most risque was chic...Other ladies like Whitney Houston, Bjork, Sade..dont show so much of themselves all of the time, and the have the aura of chicness and sophistication, Mariah is worth the same! She should take note!<br />Anyway..buy this album and her new album &quot;Glitter&quot;..I think I am becoming a reforemd fan!
0440236304|4.0|Donald Burgett served as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division and gifts us with this remarkable account of his experience during the Allied invasion of Normandy.  The first part of the book about the formation of the paratroopers and their early training will be familiar to those who have read Stephen Ambrose's &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; or watched the HBO miniseries.  From D-Day forward, however, the stories are very different.  In comparison to &quot;Currahee!&quot;, BoB appears to be an almost sanatized version of the invasion and fighting in Normandy.   In &quot;Currahee!&quot; Burgett does not hesitate to vividly describe the horrors of war - excrutiating wounds, rotting corpses, moments of incredible fear and agony.  Even if you think that you are prepared to face these grim realities, you will still find Burgett's frankness disturbing.  However, I encourage you not to let this put you off reading this book.  Burgett's experience in Normandy was extraordinary, and he does a masterful job of conveying all the terror, exhilaration and grief he experienced.  Since this is just one man's story, it necessarily captures only one perspective about a limited part of the invasion, but Burgett's skillful storytelling successfully conveys what many of the troops must have been thinking and feeling during those remarkable days.

0446677450|3.0|I have heard Mr Kiyosaki speak, and I find him to be an interesting raconteur. Indeed, this book is full of great anecdotes, but I was hoping for much more detailed advice than what I got.<br />This is a book geared at the American market. It contains a lot of investment and tax details applicable only to Americans, not for those from other continents like myself. For example, although it sounds very impressive, I have no idea what a 1031 tax deferred exchange is - or what it is supposed to achieve. Surely where instances of these terms occur, a re-write could have been done explaining the equivalents in other countries. At the very least, a glossary could have been included.<br />This is fundamentally a very interesting book. It has sold millions of copies around the world, and I have one of them. My criticisms are few, but I do believe that it would be a better book if a few amendments were made.
B00004XMS0|5.0|Another fanatastic DVD collection. The first 2 Batman's are truly works of wonders. I thought Jack Nicholson as the Joker and Danny Devito as the Penguin were excellent choices for those particular villians. I wasn't very sure about Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman but she pulled it off quite well. I thought Val Kilmer did a good job in the 3rd film, but Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were absolutley a riot and the addition of Robin (Chris O'Donnel) was a cool also.<BR>The first clue for me that the 4th film had some problems was that Arnold Schwarzenegger got top billing. Clooney just couldn't pull it off The way Keaton and Kilmer did. But they surrounded him with a super cast that included Alicia Silverstone and Umma Thurman plus Chris O'donnell returning as Robin. When this movie started off with Batman and Robin on ice skates (or batskates, your choice), I thought I was watching the old TV show. I was just waiting for a &quot;Kapow&quot; or &quot;Boom&quot; to show up on the screen. Still, for the most part it was entertaining to watch and not a bad movie, just had alot to live up to.<BR>The most amazing thing was probably the fact they always had great casting and every actor/acctress they chose to play the villain was right on the money.<BR>This DVD collection is definitley worth the money, especially those who are Batman fans.

0375703861|3.0|Zadie Smith's book \\"White Teeth\\" reminded me of Hanif Kureishi and his works, \\"My Beautiful Launderette\\" and \\"Buddha in Suburbia.\\"  Smith, like Kureishi, finds the humor and evokes the pathos from the modern-day immigrant's experience in England.  Her characters, like Kureishi's, are an eclectic mix of East and West, and play out the mingling of cultures in their character arcs.<br />Smith's imagination runs amok in a pleasant way; in the book she features a sham Islamic fundamentalist group, an absurd genetic engineering project, an overeager suburban middle-class family, and Jehovah's Witnesses.  The characters surf their way through these groups and their fantastic conflicts as a response to their inner, emotional lives rather out of any political or ideological conviction, which provides the comedy: ridiculously exaggerated situations stocked with serious and emotionally afflicted characters.  Smith's prose is crisp and utterly descriptive.  At times, it can be moving or tense.<br />However, despite Smith's characters, the comedy, and her descriptive skills, the book is disappointing.  The characters sacrifice consistency for dynamism.  The plot skittles about like a flock of chickens on a frozen lake.  The quality of the book varies; the first part feels like the work of a novice; the middle, the work of an experienced professional novelist; the last feels rushed, as if prodded by a deadline and left unrevised.<br />Not bad for a first book.  Considering the popularity of \\"White Teeth,\\" we'll likely soon see more work by Zadie Smith, no doubt more polished.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|What more can I say. The all time best selling album. It broke all records to break and left no stone unturned. All Michael Jackson fans should already have this album and those you don't, I really don't know what to say. The extra tracks on Thriller are somewhat pleasing. My personal favourite is &quot;Someone In The Dark&quot; from the ET movie. It's a real touching, melodic piece and takes you back to the storyline at first listen even. The demo version of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; is astounding as it showcases Michael on the mic, as raw as ever with a very detailed signature bassline of the song. &quot;Carousel&quot; is another signature MJ song with a soft melody and feel good lyrics. I strongly recommend this album to anyone who wishes to experience the true artistic side of MJ, the original Thriller days MJ.

B00005QGAX|5.0|Although this album was released 14 years ago, the sound of the music stays fresh in your head. Michael Jackson's music has always stood out from the rest and if you don't have Bad yet, this is a time as good as any to buy it. What more with the remastered digital sound and extra tracks. I must say that the extra track &quot;Streetwalker&quot; is a typical Jackson sounding record and in my opinion should have made it on the album on the initial pressing. And the spanish version of IJCSLY is amazing, Michael's vocals really shine on this one as opposed to the english version. &quot;Fly Away&quot; is a brilliant love theme that is reminiscent of the old Michael we know and all I can say is that this album is well worth the buy, even for the extra 3 tracks alone.
B000002UJQ|1.0|OK Computer is one of the best albums of the 90s as most listeners and critics tend to agree; because of the impact that it had when it was released in 1997. Seems as if they had been building up the sound in previous albums and released that sound at full magnum on OK Computer. Radiohead's sound captures the modern age (clean guitars, ufo like keyboards) and compliments their themes: alienation, isolation, control, society's many problems.<br />Thom Yorke's voice is at its most effective, multi-tracking, soaring, the choir boy with an oppresed soul and his lyrics work with minimalistic defined depression. All the songs are of high quality and I especially like Subterranean Homesick Alien because of the effects and Electioneering for its power. <br />Something has got to be said about Radiohead's use of artwork for their albums. Machinery, motorways and cold colors grace OK Computer but, in general, the point of each of their albums is highlighted by the artwork.
0790741520|5.0|Get over the Segal thing, people.  This movie is not just action.  It's action/suspense, and that's something Segal could never carry by himself.  Yes, he dies early in this movie, but given the talent that permeates the cast, he IS the weakest link.  Don't get me wrong, Segal is good in an action movie, but the man can only play one kind of character (which is why he's the only one in this star-studded cast who is not working right now).  He was put in the same movie with Kurt Russell, Man of a Thousand Characters, a surprisingly effective John Leguizamo (and I wish he'd take more serious parts like this one), a very talented and versatile BD Wong (the non-martial-arts Asian whom nobody appreciated enough to mention), and Oliver Platt, who is entertaining no matter what role he plays.  With these guys on one hand and Segal on the other, you can't blame the powers that be for their (pardon the pun) executive decision.  At least he went out better than Emilio Estevez in Mission Impossible.

B00003CX5P|5.0|I've been A HUGE Star Wars fan since i was a little kid when i saw jedi in the theaters twice and like many kids went to Burger King afterwards for the classic and collectable glasses. I've witnessed the emotional return to the theaters for the re-releases and all the updates on video and was there opening day for Ep.1 and when it came to video. Now George finally gives us a Star Wars film on dvd and it looks amazing! Thsi Film looks so amazing that Jar Jar actually looks pretty darn good and that says alot right there! This is what dvd's are for and finally we have  Star Wars film on dvd. Now let me get to what bugs me and it has nothing to do with the actual dvd. The people who call themselves fans are greedy! Of course they've re-released the orginal trilogy quite a few times (the 1st time was with new sound and picture quality-the box set with yoda/vader/s.trooper covers)then they released a box set of the special editions and then they re-released the special editions just to clean some of the stuff up, add a ep.2 teaser (which had many complaining but still had people whining) and put it back into print (the special editions were out of print as was the original trilogy)there are so many box sets because the movies continue to go out of print (it's like disney films...they go out of print and are hard to get a hold of until the re-release-dumbo is being re-released once again soon)george has nothing really to work on with all the re-releases and has been focusing on ep.2 full time since the end of ep.1 so it's not like he's sitting in front of a t.v. each day watching soaps...the guy is busier than most of the complainers! it really makes me mad to hear people complain about the original films on dvd and want them now but george plans on taking his time with those and adding all the cut scenes...which will take time (the special editions took a few years themselves)george can't do everything at one time and it makes me mad to hear people and see people actingso foolish and imature over this. If you want a rushed dvd without good looking bonus stuff (trust me the original trilogy dvd's will blow this one away because so much stuff from those films has yet to be seen in on a screen)you'll be mad when you get it and still complain that george didn't put any effort into it! it takes him over 2 1/2 years to make 1 film and he's busy 24-7 for those years so it's not like he has the free time (of course when he does it's with his family)plus...george really didn't have much to do with the ep.1 dvd. Sure he threw in his input but it's not like he focused on this one 100% (that's why i'm sure there will be a even better ep. 1 when in 2005-2006 when the original trilody hits dvd!)Be happy he gave us this and didn't wait until after he was finished with ep.3! George has gave us more than any other filmmakers have ever have given us and still people want more and more! It's sad! Be happy with what this guy has given us because for a while there he didn't want to do Star Wars anymore and we msy have never been blessed with 3 more films or Star Wars on dvd!

0060975768|5.0|A very good account of the Korean War in an easy-to-read fashion.  Not a droning history book, but a fluid interesting book that takes you inside what went on during the war from everyone's perspective.
B000053ZRR|1.0|Don't waste your time with this DVD! I love Bon Jovi, but this DVD stinks! The picture is VHS quality and the sound is cassette quality. Sounds like the drummer is playing behind a wall. Absolutely zero high end, and very muddy bass. If you're not going to take advantage of DVD technology, why offer it on DVD? I did not buy my Mitsubishi HDTV and Sony ES gear to watch VHS.<br />This is by no means a gear or calibration issue. I have plenty of music DVD's that sound excellent on my gear.
6300246787|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I was 12 or 13 years old. I have seen this movie 50-60 times since then. I am now 25. Barbra Streisand is Perfect! The movie is wonderful. Barbra truly makes the movie what it is. Classic. The costumes are beautiful, the choreography is wonderful, and the casting, well, it's perfect. This movie could not have been any better if you paint the charachters with five feet if 24k gold.  -- review by Shanna Williams

B00003CX8J|5.0|I love this movie for many reasons. For one the Marvel Universe has never done a movie this well except Blade. The movie tries not to be comic style and instead goes for a realistic approach. The characters could actually exist in our universe, no outrageous spandex tights or overly comical dialogue, actually quite mature and intelligent conversations and brilliant acting. DVD is loaded with good stuff too. Must buy for anyone with a lick of sense.
B00004Z4SD|1.0|God, this is a film better left on the shelf, trust me. Sure the acting is good, and the general screenpla is good too, but as far as interest goes, forget it, you'll be asleep sooner than the you'd think from such a criticall acclaimed film.From Lnch you'd expect some type of mysterious and intriguing film, something out of the ordinary, but it i so so boring.
B000002VTE|5.0|Well, perhaps it's not as immense and influential than Pet Sounds, but it comes pretty damn close.  \\"Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space (LGWFS) is an incredible album filled with a myriad of instruments and vocals, creating its own sick amalgam of noise.  Back in the 1960's Pet Sounds achieve this same feat, but with less technology (a pitiful four-track studio), which makes it one of the greatest albums of all time.  But thirty years later Spiritualized have achieved this Pet Sounds premise.  The only difference is that LGWFS is a colder, druggier, and more hypnotic.<br />The opening title track is a remarkable achievement in minimalist-type music.  It truly does feel like a eerie voyage through space, coming across as some sort of hypnotic lullaby filled with heartbreak and sadness.  The song crescendos halfway with a myriad of vocals from Jason Pierce bombarding the listener left and right, than sadly spirals down to a soft stop.<br />The second track, \\"Come Together,\\" is a raucous anthem filled with powerful horns and thumping bass.  It stands out as one of the more rocking tunes on the album.<br />\\"I think I'm in Love\\" is truly one of my favorite tracks on the album.  Again, a powerful yet elegant bass is apparent, with a sort of melodious droning sound in the background.  Spiritualized do a good job in infusing some delta blues with its excellent use of harmonica.  Also, traces of piano pop can be found here.<br />\\"Electricity\\" is like the twisted brother of \\"Come Together.\\"  It has several elements of 1960's rock and 1970's blues-rock, yet they are interspersed with Spiritualized trademark \\"space rock\\" sound.  Another flat out rocking tune on the album.<br />\\"The final track, \\"Cop shoot cop...\\" is a seventeen minute rock opus, that has its own arc.  Starting out like a cool jazz tune that you would here at some upper-class cosmopolitan club, it grabs your attention with its oscillating hypnotic sway.  It gradually builds up until it becomes a bombardment of noise, which in some ways is excessive since it goes for longer than in needs to.  It calmly recedes back to its cool jazz state and fades out, pulling the listener away from the seventy minute injection of sound.<br />LGWFS as several important qualities and values that make it an excellent listen.  For one, Jason Pierce's vocal are on key throughout the album, especially on \\"I think I'm in Love.\\"  The second aspect of this album that stands out is that among all the swirling sounds and noises of the album, the bass seems to be always apparent and thriving, a rarity that is not found in a lot of rock music.  Third, Spiritualized has, like Brian Wilson did with Pet Sounds, successfully combined several instrumetns to create one dynamic, unified sound.  In short, Spiritualized's LGWFS is a superb listen, and, along with Mercury Rev's<BR>\\"Deserters Songs\\" and \\"All is Dream\\", is an excellent foray into the wonderful world of space rock.
0780619587|5.0|What can I tell ya, when I was just 8 years old I can remember sitting next to a piano with my father, who wasn't as insane as the one in the movie, but was enough problematic to make me remember that unpleasant experience. This movie is amazing, the plot is excellent, and the actors are wonderful, not one phony moment, but a well written script that makes you shed a tear at the end of it. You have the same feeling like in Rocky movies every time you see david appear in a concert - it makes you feel the experience he is going through. Excellent performance by the actors I must add... If you have it already, it can be an excellent gift to any music teacher you know, or anyone who's into playing Piano or any other instrument. Buy it, you won't regret it, trust me.

B00003CXN4|5.0|Traffic is one of the most amazing and powerful movies to come out in a long time. It had the suspense you needed while kept its relaism and story in place. I was very disappointed when hearing that it had not received the Oscar for best picture. I personally think Gladiator won because of its historical value which was fantastic. But when it comes to story, this blows Gladiator and the other competiors out of the picture. For this, it won the best screenplay award which it rightfully deserved. Traffic is one of those movies where you need to watch it more than once to fully understand it and rightfully acknowlede it. After that, you'll say to yourself, &quot;What a great movie and even more, what a great message&quot;.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This film is now one of my favorites.  Beautifully filmed in the lush English countryside, Gwenyth Paltrow shines as the lead role and Jeremy Northam is everyone's idea of a dashing gentleman in this classic romantic comedy.  Ewan McGregor and Toni Collette are equally good in their roles, though seem somewhat jarringly modern.  Collette also doesn't match the description of the character in the book, which slightly draws away from the plausibility of the story line.  Alan Cumming puts in another fabulous performance as the slightly smarmy Mr. Elton and Sophie Thompson, sister to Emma Thompson, is fabulously funny.  All in all, a highly entertaining, engaging film.
0780631684|4.0|I thought this movie was quite good. It had an interesting premise yet there were several things we should point out:<br />1) Girl friend dies yet there's no reaction whatsoever, I mean, it's plausible right after it happens due to shock yada yada, but I mean... throughout the rest of the movie there's no hint of distress... confusing to say the least.<br />2) After his best friend dies, and goes to the morgue, he doesn't seem to worried or sad... that's just not right.<br />3) Why the hell does death finally strike back RIGHT AT THE PRECISE MOMENT when they realise something's wrong, and that they shoud be dead by then? Why not before? I mean... come on.<br />Well, I hope you agree on these glitches if you HAVE seen the movie, and if you haven't yet... DO WATCH it, and don't worry... these are minor details... no spoilers =)
B00004U2HK|5.0|A cheerful, family classic starring Julie Andrews, there is a reason that this is one of the most beloved movies of all time.  With a wonderful, familiar score and breathtaking scenery, it lasts through many repeats.  Some of the costumes and hairstyles are out of date, as they were in the style of the 60's rather than the late 30s (the Baroness' wardrobe and styling were closer, but still off), but overall, it's a film that endures.

0671004107|4.0|There are few books that leave you with the disire to discuss life, the universe and everything and this is one of them.  Thought provoking and engaging at the same time.  The book has some flaws that the the film was able to repair (one of the few times I think a movie improved on an already great book) - the book has a tendency to be a little too technical and plods occasionally and the ending is slightly weak.  But it's a facinating, well thought out tale by one of the greats of science and science fiction.
