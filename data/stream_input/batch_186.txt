B002E2JYWC|4|So nice to find a soap that doesn't contain everything on earth  ie lavender  olive+fruits  parabens  dyes  citrus  grains!<br /><br />Gentle  yet cleans.  Good for those of us who are highly allergic and who have ultra dry skin.
B003T18TE6|5|I've always loved this brand since I went blond last summer. Love it. Makes my hair nice and soft. Easy to manage. Although I found this same set a a Regis for only 25$. Might buy from there from now on. Also. Took a while to get here all the way from Florida.
B000LUXO3E|5|Nothing else works as good on my hands and feet and this.
B002F50FYE|1|Very delicate material . This hurts like crazy and saw no results
B00NJ681Z8|5|I bought this set in order to decide what overall fragrance I liked best so I could order a large size.  I love them all and can't decide which I like best.  So, I'll keep buying this set and keep them in my purse.
B002DZ65ZO|5|I like this scent.  I normally would buy at walmart.  I needed more product to get free shipping.  this is a good product and I get lots of compliments on the smell.
B00000JGVX|2|This product gives good results, but has a tendency to leak scalding water from the steam vents.
B005MR8UDU|5|This is the best foundation mineral powder in the world. Once you try it, you never go back. I always order it online since it's so much cheaper than getting it from a Mary Kay lady, but I almost feel guilty about that because I could be giving someone such good business by buying this powder all the time. Makes your face look natural and flawless. Love.
B002V17XME|1|Made my hair frizzy and NOT smooth or straight. Waste of $12.
B001KYRRNI|1|it is creamy which is good. but it doesn't blend on skin perfectly. I bought way lighter than my skin.
B003AOFLFC|5|Once I got the hang of using it and not getting my hair caught; it gave me gorgeous curls that last for 2 days.  It takes a little time to navigate.
B000H6A02A|5|THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ELECTRIC RAZOR - I REALLY LIKE THIS KIND, THEY WORK VERY GOOD
B00HHR0SYW|2|It's OK very thin
B00ED5HCXG|5|This is perfect for my home made beauty products.  And it's a relatively attractive bottle at a great price.  Pump works great.
B004CDRUOA|3|It works really well and smells nice.  It's pretty thick, though, so it's sort of hard to rub on.  It also leaves a pearly sheen to your skin, which isn't that noticeable, but is a little annoying to me.  It's not surprising for a mineral based sunscreen though, and what's more important is that it works.  I'd buy it again.
B008RST90Y|5|My fiance' loves this -- it is so cool and refreshing.  And it smalls so very good!  Yea for this product.
B00NBHRNSG|5|perfecr
B006QB4BSE|5|How do I love this product? Let me count the ways:<br />I use in body lotion - any inexpensive lotion will do;<br />I add it in leave in serums for my hair - it is a most potent weapon against psoriasis;<br />After showering and toweling off, I smear  a little in my pubic area to keep that area nice and fresh (coconut oil is an antimicrobial);<br />If I am out of my Kerasal foot ointment, I use this on my feet.
B00AZBVKAS|5|easy to use, and the size is perfect to. great for precipitant nail art's, my kids have a lots of fun with this.
B002RTZJAI|3|Loved it until the wood broke off
B005NY3O1K|5|good buy. takes a few minutes to heat up but works well when it is ready to use. better pick to curl lashes versus the clamp.
B00MC5ZI3U|5|When first I was struck with hot flashes about 14 years ago, they were severe and brought me to my knees. I did not want to go the route of prescribed synthetic hormones. I suffered for about 3 to 4 years before accidentally discovering Phyto-B. I have been using this product for close to 10 years. I too panicked when the pellets were discontinued. Then came the liquid form to the rescue!  It has saved my life, actually allowed me to regain my life. I have been purchasing it from Amazon for about the last 5 years, never a problem. So grateful.
B006972O6G|4|Nice and fast!!!
B00538TSMU|5|I have yet to wear them but they did come on time. They look great and I like the fact that the line is thicker. Sometime when the line is thin they mess up and you can't wear them more than twice. I can't wait to wear them and try some on others. The price was great also I will be buying again.
B00HYV8WK8|5|It was what it was supposed to be
B000EODU40|5|This is a great product and it's REAL mud. I have ordered from other companies and received diluted or fake mud. This stuff is good quality and not diluted. I will continue to buy this product. Thank you!
B010GHFEIO|5|Easy to attach to dryer, gives a nice smooth blow dry and when I used it worked so much faster on clients hair than just my blow dryer<br />Thanks!
B004OHQR1Q|5|These are great. Work wonderful. One side on each is the same on all 5 sticks. You don't get 10 different sizes. Great for price. Delivery on time and come in case.
B005NWMR56|3|Product was different than the product I purchased in a salon. The product from the salon had a little grit to it. This product has no grit and appears to be more watery? I will go back and purchase from the salon. The higher price from the salon is well worth it.
B000G666I8|5|I have used this same pant's presser for years. Then it finally \\"died,\\" and  I have been looking for it in catalogs. Then, Eureka, I thought enough to look on Amazon.com and low and behold they carried it. I'll once again  have crisp pants without shelling out extra money to dry cleaners.  T. Powell, Florida
B00020DY2O|5|Great shampoo and has greatly reduced by itching and flaking.
B00J3MPS4E|5|I decided to see what all the hype was about with Gillette's new razor and I am very impressed. Great new razor with a very smooth cut. Highly recommend
B00E718N6G|5|Love them.
B00HFG83GA|5|Weird hippie scent out of the bottle, but I applied it anyway and once my skin and the lotion warmed up to each other, it gave off a really luxurious scent. Very warm base but not a typical coconut fragrance and the watermelon add just a hit of fruit and feminince (if that makes sense?)
B004DTH77I|5|I opened and tried it yesterday, will update if notice anything negative.  These are beautifully looking shaver and trimmer, especially trimmer. Fit very well into my hands. Cost under $5. They get the job done, easy to clean. Trimmer has two options: short (about 1/4\\"?) and long (about 1/2\\"?).  Unfortunately they are quite noisy - it is fine with me but they can not be used discreetly.
B0059NA3MI|4|Beautiful bb cream feels great on the skin very smooth finish and full coverage but won't look cakey or heavy has a nice smell too. I set it with a powder still testing it out but I really like it so far just testing the lasting power so far I do need to re powder through out the day
B001ET7D9W|5|I have used Dry Idea or Dove roll on for at least 15+ years.  I was hesitant to try this, but this applies easily just like the old style, and dries almost instantly, under 30 seconds. as in you can touch your finger to your skin and it feels completely dry.  I have no idea (no pun intended) why other reviewers are giving this a low rating and saying it is wet or doesn't come out on the roller - I haven't had this experience at all!  It's great! There is absolutely no &#34;dampness&#34; at all no matter what I am doing.  It is so dry I wondered if it would even wash off!  I also thought the scent was nice - not overpowering.  I did not notice a small difference between this and the old baby powder scent.  I prefer scented over unscented just because it's nice to smell the baby powder when applying it, but I certainly don't care if the scent lasts all day.  Supposedy lasts for 72 hours but I am certainly not going to find out.  ;)  I would definitely buy this again.
B000WHWF9A|4|These tweezers are great for getting short hairs because it grabs the ends easily and has a good &#34;grip&#34; on the hair. I use it on borderline hairs on my brows where precision is necessary. It's not great for trying to get fine hairs, and sometimes leaves red bumps from even the slightest pinch. But I've been wanting to buy Tweezerman tweezers for years now and I think it was worth the couple extra bucks!
B001ECQ7G4|5|MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN STRUGGLING WITH INGROWN HAIRS AFTER SHAVING HIS FACE FOR YEARS.  I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WITH THE USE OF TEND SKIN HE NO LONGER HAS THAT PROBLEM.  TEND SKIN IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT!
B000MTJOQK|3|I honestly wasn't to impressed with this lotion at all it has a more of a bland smell and i was using the cypher lotion and that one is honestly much better
B00MYSHEFK|5|Great
B000J2CTYE|5|Very big bottle it it smells so soft and wonderful not too strong.  I like to use it when i go to bed!!!!
B004UKT21Y|5|It's so simple ...I've had it for a couple of months and no complaints!<br />I Keep it at 350 degrees...the curls come out smooth and shiny and they last without Hair spray! I got the XL and they still come out a little tight so if you want loose curls the XL is your best bet just grab bigger chunks of hair and start curling the lower part. The price of this is great! and don't forget your heat protector!
B00GD6AW3K|5|Very good.
B002RPJAO8|1|I was very disappointedwith these mits. The vibrations were very soft and the heat was so low that it was hard to feel. VERY LOW HEAT. It would cost too much to send them back so there in the Attic.
B009OJ7SGC|5|Love this product!
B000P2526A|5|I can only find this product online and love using it.  Many compliments are received whenever I wear it.<br /><br />S
B00GWBR4ZU|4|great for when you want to add a bit of color as well as a plump to your lips. I do it wen I first wake up before I put my makeup on and if I am going to an event I do it while I am prepping and getting ready. I like to have it on for at least 20 minutes. if you suck to hard you can bruise but nothing crazy just don't assume you are going to have gigantic lips in 1 day.
B00G24VMKK|5|I was shown this product during one of my hair cuts, and I love it. I have tried about every hair product for short to medium length hair, and this one is by far the best. It smells great, and works perfect for the person who wants a semi shine look without the gross flakes you get with hairspray or gel. It is a lotion type product that will also moisturize your hands while you apply it. It's much better than a balm or a wax, and it allows for great control of your hair though out the day. It only takes a small amount to style my entire head.<br /><br />HOW I USE IT:<br /><br />I use about a dime size portion and put it on my hand and rub my hands together then apply it to my hair evenly. I like to use it a few minutes after getting out of the shower. That way my hair is still damp, but has had a few minutes to air dry. It makes it easier to shape my hair the way I like it, while still giving it a little of that wet hair look all day long. If you like the drier look let your hair completely dry first.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Holds Great all Day<br />Lotion Like Texture (Don't have to wash your hands after, just rub it in like a lotion)<br />Does not leave your hands or hair sticky or gross.<br />Smells great!<br /><br />CONS:<br />It's a little pricey, but lasts a long time if you only use small amounts.<br />Only comes in small bottles.
B005VX8S4G|5|I was very surprised at how well these were etched.  I had much better luck with designs stamping with the entire image fully covered with polish - I can physically feel the difference between these and my Bundle Monster plates when I run my fingertip over the designs.  I'm thinking, given other reviews, that it's just luck of the draw whether or not yours take polish well or not.  Seems like etch quality is pretty random in ALL brands.<br /><br />I do like the designs more on these as well. Another reviewer called them whimsical, I believe, and that's pretty apt.  There's a number of heart themed ones as well as a couple that say 'love' in various pretty ways.<br /><br />Are the edges sharp?  Yes, but there's a simple way to avoid getting cut.  Don't run your hands/fingers along the edges!  This really shouldn't be something that would stop you from purchasing these lovely plates.  A little personal awareness and the problem is solved.
B004Y9GYZS|5|Love IT!<br />The color is amazing!<br />You can pretty much adjust what color you want!<br />Rub it twice on your lips for a cute soft pink look, or rub it on more for a pinker look!<br />It does do wonders to your lips, like a baby's bottom!<br />Plus it comes with 2! I didn't know that, so that's even better! &lt;3
B003IJE8BW|5|My, name is Allison, and I have been using this product for 20 years.  It has not only prevented blemishes, but wrinkles and fine lines as well.  Go Dr, Murad!!                                             Allison T.
B004DPDS8E|4|Bought this in bulk before I started following a no sulfates, no silicones, curly girl method. I will hang onto it because I found it to be the best styling gel for me when I wasn't following curly girl.
B006K9OQSC|3|didnt find it easy to use. will not recommend to buy.. i preffer the doughnut..chipped as described, affordable, looks durable,
B005YB42EA|5|This is one of my favorites and I purchased for my wife - she loves it! Shes happy, therefore, I am happy!
B00J8SHOUE|5|This palette is to die for! The packaging is great and modern. The colors are absolutely beautiful and they last all day. It is definitely a great value and I am so happy to own it.<br />My favorite color is the Monaco because it's so vibrant and different than any other pinks I have ever had. I like that it goes on the same shade as what it looks like in the palette itself. The St. Tropez is also extremely pretty and natural looking with just a hint of glitter to it.<br />I love the Glamour Guide because it helps me put colors together and apply them in a way that I normally don't know how to do so I'm getting better at application and blending techniques. Without a book I would have been randomly trying to pair colors together and probably not been able to come up with looks as great as the ones shown!
B00FYZQ0QO|1|I really wasn't a fan of this product. I have the spray and love it but this body butter is really hard to rub and goes very streaky. I will be sticking to the spray from now on. I do still love Fake Bake products though, this one just wasn't for me.
B001GTK9SC|5|Excellent product, and it will not weigh hair down.
B004D2C57M|5|Very good
B00KYUXIOG|3|This product is amazing. My skin is baby soft, looks brighter & i feel that it also tightens my skin. Love it.
B001GBIU36|5|If you're reading this on Amazon keeping shopping. Protein 29 can be had for about $2.00 less than the price shown ($5.85) on other sites. I love this product, but it's becoming harder and harder to find.
B004CLUMKQ|5|This helps so much to get rid of my razor bumps.  It's just so expensive though.  But it works for me.
B0029FLT86|4|Good lipstick at a good price.  Applies easily and is a neutral color that goes well with different colored clothing.
B00KYW8CY0|5|I am always open to trying new beauty products. The most recent trend of products I have tried is facial serums. While I have hated some and liked others I have hardly loved any. One recent serum that I have tried that I do love is the New Radiance Naturals Vitamin C Serum.<br /><br />First off the product is not tested on animals and is made with natural ingredients. It is so hard to find beauty products these days with BOTH of these attributes so this was important to me. I also loved their money back guarantee if you were not pleased with the results.<br /><br />I, however, was pleased with the results. After only a couple of weeks of using I could tell that my skin was 'happier'. What I mean by 'happier' was that it no longer looked dull and actually looked brighter when I had no makeup on.<br /><br />This serum was not greasy at all. It was actually very watery for a serum so it absorbed much faster and was not sticky on the skin. You also did not have to wait as long to do the rest of your beauty routine since it did not take as long to absorb.<br /><br />I still have some redness on my face that I do need to cover with at the very least a BB Cream but I am hoping over time that it was also fade as I continue to use this serum.
B002T71IL2|1|doesn't work<br />what a mess<br />drips, smears and after all that doesn't even work<br />I rate it minus 5 stars
B004KIB688|4|I was recommended this product by a friend who works at a salon and my face feels so clean when I use it. Lots of bubbles and smells phenominal I haven't noticed a huge change, though t be fair I am not very routine about using it.<br /><br />**note** The lid cracked all the way across the top when I screwed it on once.
B00HEODENK|5|Leaves your hair smooth and shiny. Wonderful product for people with highlighted hair. Would recommend this item to everyone for sure.
B004HI5H4U|1|I have fair skin and got the lightest version yet it was still too dark and kind of orange. I was disappointed that I spent a good Mount of money on it.
B00BWRLJ6O|5|Update I've been using this shaver for around a year now, give or take. I'm still delighted with it. A few updates: -  * I neglected to mention that it took no time at all to get used to shaving with this device. It was comfortable from the off. * When traveling on business on one occasion, I forgot my shaver, but fortunately I keep a Gillette Mach 3 complete with a new blade in my traveling kit, so was able to compare the results again. I was surprised to find how much I preferred the Braun shaver over the razor. It was much more comfortable and the shave seemed closer, too. * I have altered my routine slightly. I typically just run it under a hot faucet before I shave after washing my face with hot water. This gives great results. * The cleaning fluid lasts forever now. I replaced the last container after around three months and could have used it for longer. * It seems like I take a little longer to shave now, but that's probably because I am obsessing about getting the closest shave possible. The results really are excellent, but I should probably lighten up a little. :) * It's a really excellent shaver and I recently bought my Dad one as a present.  *****************  I used a top of the line (dry shave only) Braun for several years twenty years ago with good results before switching to a wet/dry Panasonic until around 2001. I can't remember why I stopped using the latter, but for at least ten years I had been perfectly content with my daily routine of shaving twice with a Gillette Mach 3, once with the grain and then against the grain. I found that the Mach 3 worked better than the Fusion for this and I managed to get ultra-close results with little irritation and only occasional cuts - so why go back to electric? But then I lucked out when a local department store decided to stop selling electric shavers and sold their remaining stock at deep discounts. At ~$160 for the top of the line wet/dry Braun, it just seemed to be a deal too good to miss.  I've been using my Braun 799cc for the last 6 months and have been very pleased with the results - this really is an excellent shave, even in comparison with my manual routine. I find that I get approximately the same level of closeness (manual against-the-grain shaving is arguably marginally keener, but the difference is negligible at best) with no cuts, no irritation, and less hassle. And I can shave before going out in the evening, too, without removing my shirt.  My routine with the Braun is pretty simple. I do a dry shave to &#34;prepare the field&#34; and then soak my face with hot water for a few seconds before performing a wet shave to get amazingly close results. This approach requires no gel at all - I can only imagine that gel would get in the way - and the time cost seems insignificant. For me, the additional wet cycle makes a significant difference in closeness and I expect that this is what sets this model apart from the 790cc.  Cleaning the shaver is straightforward. My routine for this is to remove the foil and rinse it out, dry brush any remaining stubble off the head, and then run a full cleaning cycle. This is almost certainly overkill, but it doesn't take more than a minute or so and I have found that the cleaning solution lasts for a very long time (two months or so?) this way. Also, when I experimented by running this procedure in reverse (rinsing with water following a cleaning cycle) a little stubble was still washed out of the foil, so mine seems to be the most thorough method. Finally, when I'm traveling without the base, this approach allows me to keep the shaver very clean regardless of the hygiene level indicated in the LCD display (which appears to be based solely on the number of shaves since the last cleaning cycle.)  Time-wise, it's probably a wash between my old double-manual procedure and my new somewhat elaborate routine, but initial preparation and cleanup is certainly reduced, so on balance I probably save some time due to the reduced hassle.  I can't say how this compares to the top of the line equivalent Phillips or Panasonic models, but it's hard to imagine that they can be significantly better than my Braun. In any case, I'd buy it again without hesitation - even at full price.
B002LMN7B4|1|I never actually used this bar on my postpartum itchy body because it smelled so bad.  The outside of the package smelled before even opening it and made the area it sat in for a few days smell too.  It smells like smoke.. Like when you smoke meats!  My sense of smell is crazy from pregnancy and I really don't enjoy the taste or I guess smell of smoked foods, so I didn't even use this product.  It's too bad because I'm sure it would have helped my itching but I just couldn't.  It's made by a small, family owned company , and I hate leaving them a negative review but this product just wasn't right for me, which isn't to say it wouldn't have helped my itching!  It may have, I just couldn't get myself to use it!
B007762NQE|3|Tried this because the price was attractive and it got some good reviews.  Doesn't work as well and doesn't smell as nice as Weleda, which is, unfortunately, much more expensive.  The lavender scent is weak.
B00F5TR464|1|I don't normally leave bad reviews, but this purse is not at all what the picture shows. It looks very cheap. The hardware is flimsy and tarnished. Like others mentioned, the inside smells awful. I tried Febreeze and dryer sheets and it still smells bad. I would love to get my money back, but it took so long to get here that I don't feel like going through the hassle.
B000GX8UI0|5|I purchased this color after seeing it in the store and I knew I had to have it. if you like dark then this is the one for you. Its a VERY rich grape-like color with so much shine. it looks black in some lights but when you look closer you can see the purple. I highly reccomend this color because it is beautiful. my first bottle broke and I was ordering a replacement not 10 minutes later.
B00479FP4Q|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I wasn't sure what I was getting exactly, but am so happy with it. What it is is a dry little towel, 5x7 inches or so that has a solution in it. you wet it and kind of rub it to get the suds out. Then you can wash your face and remove your makeup. I use it to remove my eye makeup and it doesnt sting at all, which I was so happy about. So, I will continually buy this as the product runs out. It saves me time and im more encouraged to wash my face bc i have to take my makeup off anyways. LOVE IT. Note: I cut these in half because I dont have a ton of heavy make up on, so half the towel does the trick for me. I cut a stack at once. Oh, other great thing, you dont have to worry about sealing the package like other towels cause these are dry and you add water.
B0087O4XKE|5|I am a do it yourself nail art girl, and depending on your level of expertise, it can get pricy so I am always looking for a good deal on quality products. When testing out first time used products it is easy to pick the wrong one and waste money but this glitter set is a great buy. I am very pleased with it and I plan to get the larger set with more colors. the glitter offers endless decorating combos and I am extremely happy with this purchase.
B0000YUXI0|5|It worked the first day! My son is 5 and has been sucking his 2 middle fingers all these years and nothing else worked. Try it and you won't be sorry you did! Less than a month and he is finger sucking free! IT'S AWESOME and best of all IT WORKS!!!
B00FH692PQ|5|It really work.
B001ESIZA4|5|Love this stuff!  I use it to keep flyaway hair under control and to keep my eyebrows in place.
B000CQRT9C|2|the product seems good but i have been using it for about 3 weeks now and i do not see a difference in any of my acne scars or freckles, i have darkness around my nose and mouth as well and this did nothing for me. The consistency is nice it absorbs right into the skin, it doesnt break me out which is good, but it just didnt do anything. it does not solve hyper-pigmentation issues.
B00EEOGIWC|5|This product does seem to work well!
B0046NEYB8|5|GREAT PRODUCT, THE COLOR REMAINS IN MY HAIR FOR A WHILE, AS OPPOSED TO OTHER PRODUCTS I HAVE USED, I LOVE IT.
B00NY5NGPE|5|This Vitamin C is super good the smell of Orange, as if you had just eat an orange, the Vitamin C Serum is so good that you see the strength and shine to your skin from the first time you use it, &#34;I love &#34;really happy&#34; this Serum, I will be client in this Vitamin C Serum. No.  Skin Clearing Serum also is the best that can buy this product help to firm you skin in just a few days
B00KP5TS4Y|5|Got it fast, works wonderful.  Bought it for pimples and it is very efficient!
B000143K2A|5|I recently gave birth to a baby boy. If your a woman you know how your hormones are all over the place. My hair was shedding really bad. I would go to a beautician here in Germany but they charged $135 for something that's only $80 back in the states. So I figured I'd buy this to help save some money. And it worked. My hair stopped shedding so bad and is more manageable. Ive used this product as a child and regret not continuing this as an adult. Now I will!
B004UA2SLU|5|l love all palmer products.
B004Q8GYES|4|I've used it two days in a row now and I definitely feel the clean. Great product. I feel like the results will be worth it.
B004R6RQOG|5|This product is amazing. I love it and it really works. I will be repurchasing it once I run out.
B00336EUTK|5|This product is the only one that has worked for me.  I drink a lot of coffee, and other products didn't do it.  Very easy to apply and remove.
B00MJDON2M|1|I never ordered these.
B00DCYHU18|5|Love Ibd great color!
B000NNO3FW|5|I very much like this shampoo. It smells delicious and the scent lasts long.  It makes your hair very soft too. I use it in conjunction with the conditioner. I would not buy this product on amazon, however. It is much cheaper in stores- I got mine at giant eagle and walmart for about $3.
B0019SPNQ8|5|I brought this with on a family vacation where we had to share a bathroom with 8 people.  My private bathroom moments were kept private.  Now I keep some in my purse, just in case.
B007AZ4IWY|3|Worked great until I wore it for several hours then it felt like it wasn't making a good connection & felt like only part of it was working. But all in all it was worth it for the price and I did feel some relief. Alot really. I'll buy again
B007K6K0IY|4|I like the subtle scent. Not overwhelming at all. I like the dispenser because you can use a little or a lot. It feels refreshing but does stay sticky for longer then i would like.
B000GHYWTM|2|It is very disappointing that the scent isn't there any more.  Now I have to fine something else and that's not easy where I live and can't  travel or have smell-a-vision yet.
B0050ZP956|5|Excellent product i highly recommend very good.i loved it. What we wanted. Very good everything I expected. comprenlo - guaranteed.
B00SMIIR0W|5|Works great for shower shaving and trims.
B002HEW7YO|5|Great color for my paler skin.  It gives me great color within 2 to 3 tanning sessions and doesn't have that horrible fake tan look that some can give you when you have paler skin.  It's definitely MUCH cheaper to purchase it on Amazon than to get it at your local tanning salon.
B000BTQL3K|5|I have used it for over 25 years. The place I was buying it from quit carrying it. I like how it cleans my hair and makes it feel thicker.
B00016XDPC|5|This is a great lime aftershave. The scent is nice, not too candy-like, isn't overbearing and doesn't overstay its welcome. The performance of the aftershave is awesome. Soothes, heals, and has plenty of natural moisturizers. Doesn't dry skin out, and doesn't leave skin feeling tacky, either.
B002S000QY|5|THE PRODUCT FEELS SOFT WITH A NICE SCENT, THAT GOES ON SMOOTHLY I HAVE BEEN USING  THIS PRODUCT ONLY A WEEK @ I HAVE NOTICED A DIFFERENCE I HAD A WRINKEL THAT WAS NOTICEABLE  @ NOW ITS GONE, @ MY SKIN DOES LOOK SMOOTHER I RATE THIS A 4 STAR.      ADRIENNE
B004NJ8WFO|4|I got this product because I am not going to pay the money for a comparable Clarisonic, and have been very pleased with it so far. I have been using the face brush attachment everyday, and the body brush attachment before I shave. My face definitely feels cleaner using this brush, and I can tell my legs get a smoother shave when using the body brush. I did try the pumice attachment on my feet, and it did nothing. I have so far found no use for the sponge attachment.<br /><br />I did drop it in the shower a couple of days ago, and the battery compartment came flying off, and the four batteries went everywhere. Once it was dried out, though, it worked fine. Just a little irritation, as something that is used in a slippery shower should maybe be a little harder to come apart.<br /><br />Other than that, I am completely satisfied so far.
B00BKTXB1A|2|the pieces are amazingly beautiful but they are not practical. when I opened the package and saw the bows I thought the earrings I ordered arrived early. to my dismay they were the 3D bows. I will mount them and use them as a pair of earings and three necklaces.
B0016SJLD2|5|This is great for skin rashes and cuts. My doctor recommended this for a rash in the back of my ears and my husband hit his head playing tennis and had over a 100 stitches. I used the Silver Gel on his forehead and in less than six weeks you couldn't even tell he had the stitches.  If you have any type of cut I recommend this product highly.
B000Q46K86|5|It works like the polish when I go to my dentist for cleaning, it cleanses very well, and leaves a fresh breath.  I don't mind the salty taste at all.
B00BD7EBVS|5|This works really well to secure a wig in place.
B0017JTF7C|5|I have worn Euphoria for years.  Its my favorite.  I'm always looking for a great price because it can be expensive when its not a &#34;gift&#34; and I'm just out of perfume.  I have even found Euphoria at Sam's Club for right around $57 dollars.  What I really liked about this set was the &#34;small&#34; purse size, that I was getting lotion too, and that it was the parfum.  I read the other reviews and mine set was authentic and the small bottle was full and sealed.  This set came beautifully packaged if you were giving it as a gift (it comes exactly how its pictured).  For the cost of the &#34;set&#34;; I really feel like it was a much better buy than a local department store.
B000052Y62|4|SURELY less irritating shave when using it!! (I have a thick beard and sensitive skin, bad combination, and I tried it with Braun 7526). <br />now about closer, I think that depends on the type of ur beard and skin. Braun 7526 does not do good job (not at all sometimes) on the neck and jawline, after applying Afta, now maybe a little closer on the neck and jawline, but still far from as close as other areas. so it really was not big help FOR ME for a closer shave. <br />the smell is really way strong. Even after I wash my face like 5-6 times with soap, some of it still is still there. Its kinda strong, not the kind of smell I prefer. <br /> <br />Overall, if the shaver is getting irrititating, This is a very good reason to buy Afta. If you are looking for a closer shave, I am not sure, you gotta try it, cuz it depends on ur beard.  <br />Be prepared to wash ur face 5-6 times to at least get rid of most of the scent afterwards.
B00GMP04CG|5|This is an excellent product!
B001FB5IS2|5|This is the best lotion I've ever used, hands down. I am so upset that J&J is discontinuing it!  Lightweight yet very moisturizing.  Excellent smell!
B000Q6SU3C|5|After just one shave with this razor I am completely sold on the Braun Pulsonic.  I used to have a Braun 360 Complete but stopped using it because I was not satisfied with the results.  I was a little hesitant to try again, but you get tired of using a razor, purchasing expensive blades and messy shaving cream so I took the leap once again.  It is worth the extra dollars to purchase this unit over the Braun 360 Complete.  Extremely close shave.  I did find a much lower price from iKitchen but DO NOT DEAL WITH THEM!  They  sat on my order for 14 days (which it states in the fine print, but I figured that would never happen).  iKitchen sat on the order because they don't stock anything and they figured they could buy it cheaper and re-sell. I waited two weeks to  try and save $60.   Well now their price is the same as AMAZON.  I bet iKitchen could ship it now because it's the same price. iKitchen is a loser!  Buy from Amazon, you won't regret it.  This is an excellent shaver.
B007IAE5WY|4|I have not used the products I ordered yet,  I have been using a similar product I purchased in Japan, I purchased this product as back up so I would not have to wait when my present bath towel is no longer serviceable to me.
B002WEWPGE|5|For a clean and fresh yet classic scent, this is the one of the prettiest fragrances to have.  Lasts all day and plenty of compliments to go around! :-)
B00MZPA0X0|5|Loved it!!
B00CCR2XNQ|5|Was looking for a soap and lotion with Patchouli.  Came across this set and decided to give it a shot.  Glad I did. I love these products.  The fragrance is light and most pleasant.  Not only is the lotion's fragrance wonderful, a little goes a long way and leaves my skin soft and feeling nice.
B000052WYL|4|Pretty oily, but it gets the job done.  I ended up buying the Body Shop Chamomile makeup remover (not oily at all) and use this one as a backup/ wax remover.
B000FQFRL6|5|I love the lotion and I love the smell. It is exactly what I wanted! I definitely would recommend this  to others. And I will definitely keep a supply in stock for myself
B004ZD2M6I|5|If you pop off the velcro 'Cap' the device makes a nice 'private happy time' tool 😗.
B003J5FWVU|5|the lipgloss is really a good color that I got. since im a makeup artist it will be easy to use.  the color is great for people who just want a natural gloss.  thanks
B00CWZ0BLE|3|So I recieved my organizer (and a little faster than expected) and well its pretty small which doesn't bother me i guess, most of my lipsticks fits. But when I opened it I saw a chunck of it off. Ughh I hate that but other than that it's fine.
B006FRS9O6|4|This is a great way to help your nails grow if they are pealing or just not growing, worth the money.
B00BKFI9I4|5|Love it use it every other day
B00AF2I050|4|I've been using this for a few months now.  I have young skin, as I'm only 24.  When I first started using this product, it was great.  It kept my face smooth and soft, but that was during the summer.  This is quite a liquid formula and not a very creamy product.  A little goes a long way.  I only need about two-three pumps of this to cover my entire face.<br /><br />  Into the colder months, it sits on my skin longer and actually breaks me out.  Therefore I had to take off a star.  I have switched to using a fair amount under the eyes (using something else on my face instead) and it keeps that area nice and hydrated all day.  The pump is nice and there isn't a strong perfume smell but it does have a slight odor, but nothing major.
B00DQUPBAA|5|This was a really quality bubble bath. Although it has a very perfumy smell to it, which I was worried would be too strong, once I got in the bath tub, the smell really helped me to relax.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about it was that it made my skin feel really clean while making it nice and soft. This product will last a long time because it's very concentrated.
B0027LSEPS|4|I decided to buy this irrigator because Years ago I had bought one that you had to plug in.  Although I liked the fact that the plug in models are more convenient as far as not having to worry about changing batteries and power is always consistent.  I didn't like the fact that it was so big and pretty much had to keep it out all the time because like they say out of sight out of mind.  So I opted for something that can easily be put away.  The system works well and the power is good...would like it to be a bit stronger...the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because batteries don't seem to last very long...power diminishes after about a month.
B00A8JD40G|5|EXCELENT
B000SBGX8Y|5|Third bottle I have had.  Great stuff!  Had many compliments.  Timely delivery.
B00RH8W9KW|3|Works good blends nice with eyeliner but doesnt keep lashes on past 5 hrs. Also hard to get off from eyelid
B001ET72C0|5|I ove this soap, you can do anything with it, bathe, make your own tooth gel, laundry detergent anything.  The Peppermint is better for making tooth gel.
B000KPPECY|2|I only wear medium high heels, less than 3.5 inches. I didn't expect a miracle with these insoles and certainly I didn't get one. They didn't work at all for me: the pain in the ball of my foot was the same (although I blame mainly the brick floor of Boston). However, when I contacted Insolia because one of the insoles didn't have any adhesive, they sent me a pair absolutely free. I bought them in Amazon, not in their site and they sent me new insoles nonetheless.
B00KUQFY3C|2|It broke before I even wore it
B00KDCUQ7M|5|I was so glad to be able to find someone that carried this oil because its hard to find. This scent smells really good and it's long lasting! I love it!
B00271CMTM|4|Scans showed a 3mm stone four months ago.  Hopefully it's gone.  No problems.<br /><br />I'll know for sure in two months when I get another x-ray.
B00RVCU5KU|5|Awesome brush, really happy with the quality. I've washed a few times already and no shedding at all. Super soft. Highly recommend :)
B006UUTNCU|2|Doesn't work after an extended use.
B001COG778|5|I bought this product for my self and my husband. The molds were easy to make. The bleaching trays that were made from the molds turned out well. I've only use the tray 4 times thus far but see a quit a differance. I've use store bought trays in the past that were loose in my mouth and cause me to gag.
B00USCD6K6|5|The pictures are true to life. The tweezer set arrives in a beautiful box with a ribbon and a gold stamp on it making you feel like a kid on Christmas morning opening your gifts again. I immediately tried them out because a lot of tweezers look to be the highest of quality, but then they don't work. This is not the case with these. They get a good grip on your hair and pull cleanly without pinching your skin. I can go on and on...I will definitely buy again.<br /><br />** received for review and inspection purposes **
B00YOHWTZY|5|My purchase arrived fast, and thank goodness it did! It has become a asset during bath time. Thank you simply elegant!
B007NYF4SO|4|Cute bag! Bought for my 10 year old daughter to carry her sewing supplies to class. Holds all the necessities and great price.
B001ET79QY|5|I have used this product before and the store where purchased, no longer carried the item. I am satisfied with the Alba Botanica Kona Terra Gross Tinted Lip Gloss.
B00014D5O8|5|I have this stuff on a amazon 6 month subscription. There is nothing like it to help heal cracked fingers and lips dried out by the elements. I've been using this for several years now and I usually put it on at night since it has a strong but nice fragrance. For daytime I use the non-fragrant &#34;Miracle Salve&#34;
B007XOAKK6|3|Tried product and noticed a slight difference, but haven't been able to use it daily do to personal circumstances. My arms look the same, unfortunately.
B0009VNI40|5|I have been making my lotion. I want to stay natural and chemical free. Aloe gel is the best ingredient to thin your lotion. Using coconut oil and cocoa butter makes thick butter type lotion. You will want to thin it down.
B00DBFA272|5|These are sturdy and re-useable. If you very carefully remove the glue from them after each use, you can wear them at least 5-10 times. As long as they are applied properly and close to the lash line, they look fantastic. They are perfect for theater and ok to wear out if you don't mind being a bit over-dramatic.
B006GQYSGO|1|United Airlines had my luggage, which someone rifled through and stole my 10 year old Norelco razor, of all things. I replaced it at my own cost, this was the least expensive one Amazon had, I guess you get what you pay for....
B007009VDA|5|My stylist used this product on my hair, and I loved the way it made my hair feel. I have heavy course hair that normally will not stay straight. The only problem I had was trying to turn on the vibration, I found it difficult to hold together and get to the button, I used a Q tip, got the vibration turned on, and loved it. My hair is straighter and is very shinny.  I would recommend this product for anyone that want straight shinny hair
B001UO99PC|1|The item pictured was not the item I was sent.  I was looking specifically for &#34;Goody&#34; combs and that is what was pictured as well as what the item was called.  When my package arrived the combs were not in a package and they were not &#34;Goody&#34; combs.  I have followed the guidelines for returning the wrong item and have yet to get a response or my money back.
B008RP6GGC|5|This was recommended on a blog I read as well as on an essential oil site I buy from.  I have not regretted spending the money for it and use it almost daily.  It's small water reservoir does require frequent refilling....I think it hold about 2 ounces of water.  I think we've had this about a month now and it is still performing.  It had better for $50!  It's a lot of fun choosing which essential oils to use each time you fire it up.  EOs not included, of course :)
B002QANC2A|5|My palette arrived super quick, and extremely protected with layers of bubble wrap. The palette itself is great quality for the price. Some of the colors in this are even more pigmented than some eyeshadows I've spent a lot of money on at Sephora! I'm really pleased with this palette, it's worth it.
B00K0PAUTQ|5|This oil is clear, light and absorbs quickly and fully so I don't look and feel like an oil slick. My skin loves it. I will buy again.
B00763M03O|5|I love these!  I use them on my 7 year old son and there are plenty to go around in this bag.
B000065DK3|4|I have had this straightener for over 5 years. it still works wonderful, but recently i dropped it and cracked the frame so now the plates dont stay in. I was checking a few months a go to see if they still made them because i wanted to get a new one, and one for my sister. a few months a go it was only 49.99 and i was about to buy two, but things came up where i couldnt, and now with everything back in order, they are 76 dollars. how can it have gone up so much in a few months? I know that its salon price worthy, but when it was 29.99 when i had boughten it i was willing to pay the extra 20 dollars for a new one, but i dont know about an extra 45 dollars.
B000Z5Y2XQ|5|I will use no other moisturizer unless they stop making this one...which I HOPE they don't.  You really will see a difference with regular use.
B009968WP6|5|All metal.  You can put the curling iron in there hot (which keeps it away from my toddler).
B004CJAV18|4|I love this brand. No bite or after taste and yet does the job, but it's getting harder and harder to find in this area thus I have to order it online which is more expensive than buying it locally, which is the only reason I didn't give it 5-stars.
B004VWBWHS|5|These are tons of fun!! Thank you quick shiop! Little hard to get into hair but figured it out! Thanks
B00IITJVVE|5|good
B00LVPDBA4|5|nice production！
B0009R33U8|2|Well I don't know what went wrong, but this did not seem to work. Instead my hair broke off in smaller ringlets. I followed directions to the \\"T\\", and tried to rinse as thoroughly as possible, but an hour of rinsing it out in the shower was still not enough - because my hair was DRY DRY DRY... I knew this would happen based on other reviews so I armed myself by applying the Aphogee balancing moisturizing conditoner along with Shea Moisture leave in and Avocado butter, but the dryness was a little too powerful.  I am literally afraid to use this stuff again... oh, and why didn't anyone warn me about the rank smell... All I could think was, \\"This $#&@ stinks to high heaven!\\"<br /><br />Oh well. the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I would never have found out about Aphogee Balancing Moisturizing conditioner had I not went in search for the protien treatment.
B006L5BPCU|4|One of my favorites. Not oily and very relaxing. Doesn't clog pores.
B00CTC1Z3I|5|I am a 45 year old woman who just purchased this product. I have only had 3 treatments and YES, that means only 11/2 days. My teeth have already drastically whitened.i have had 3 people ask me if I was whitening my teeth. That right there is factual success.  I was little hesitant to purchase after reading mixed reviews and thank goodness I went with my gut and purchased the pearl. Money well spent. Btw I have never written a review before but the results of this product has saved me money as well as made me happy with results thus far.
B00KO7UZFO|5|Feels great, very lightweight, very easy to apply and doesn't smell.
B007MJKHN2|5|Love love
B004Z209HS|5|I love this product.  I first discovered Argan Oil about a year ago when a friend had given me some beauty prroducts that she didn't want.  There were Argan Oil capsules and I tried them.  I loved the way my skin felt after I used them and the best part is that the product is not in the least bit greasy.  I use it every night on my face and my neck and if my hair starts feeling dry at the ends I apply some and it in overnight.  I would highly recommend this product to any woman!
B008XLEXRO|5|Such a money saver! Wish it came with more muslin strips and the wax remover.
B000GI3TZE|5|Love this product, and the only place I can find it is for sale at Amazon. The container and name have changed a little over the years, but it still works great for me.
B0029F7IHW|4|I've been looking for these! Great product for a head cold or headache to steam yourself in the shower! Smell great!
B008B0FPLU|5|these are like the ones that the salon uses and I could never find any in the regular store so I decided to go online and find some I was not sure if they would be worth it but they were worth every penny
B000C1VSIU|5|I managed to receive a sample of this cologne and I really enjoy it! You wouldn't think you can buy a nice scent for such a cheap price but this one is nice. This would go great in Summer and Spring. I can easily see myself wearing this a lot in the spring time. Its a very fresh scent. not a fresh scent to perk you up but one that is just very relaxing. Every time I smell it, I instantly just feel happy and relaxed. I'm not sure how it smells on others but on me I instantly smell the lavender and makes me feel like I've shoved my face in a bouquet of flowers (Who doesn't love the smell of flowers?!). Shortly after the green notes start picking up with the lavender. I see a lot of people say it smells a bit like the Fahrenheit summer fragrance in case you've smelled that, you can get an idea. I haven't smelled the Fahrenheit Summer Fragrance but one cologne this reminds me of that I have in my arsenal is Azzaro Chrome. It doesn't smell much like Chrome but it reminds me of the fragrance, and I prefer this over Chrome any day. Smells like a good Age: 18-35 cologne.<br /><br />I could see someone with a strong nose not liking this cologne and finding it a bit too much, but I feel most will find it a nice peaceful fresh scent. This cologne would be GREAT if you are going to an outdoor event, and you will want to apply lightly if you wear this in a small office environment.<br /><br />Would I buy this cologne for $80.00? Unlikely. But for under $30.00, this is fantastic and i can easily see myself wearing this a lot during the Spring and Summer.
B0018MQHO2|5|My mom had a true pumice stone when I was growing up, so I was surprised the first time I bought one at a drugstore to find it was nothing like what she had.  This, however, is the true deal.  It will remove dry skin or a callous in nothing flat.  In fact, you have to be gentle with it, it's so effective.  Couldn't be happier with it.
B000C21CLW|5|I was worried that it would be a fake or bad version of First because the price was so good, but it is high quality and smells just like it should.  Love this perfume.  The scent is beautiful throughout the day.
B005N9BHQY|1|Lotion is too thick to flow properly so it does not keep a continuous flow of lotion you tend to have to pound the can to get it to work.
B00W63VO7W|4|pleasant smell, seems to work well
B005PR0AE4|5|Last time, one of the toothgel tubes arrive opened and unusable. This time all was ok.
B001TSRPQY|5|fantastic no more available in stores
B00H93NJLS|4|If you're wondering what fresh Argan oil should smell like, this is it. I love the rich, nutty smell, which disappears a few moments after you apply the oil. Definitely the freshest argan oil I've used, (another brand had an 'old' odor and I'm still trying to get a refund on the full bottle I recently bought.<br /><br />Which brings me to another plus of purchasing this oil - Instanatural's amazing customer service. Just read their replies to negative reviews here, and you'll see what I mean. This company will issue a hassle free refund, in case it doesn't work out for you. This is also the largest size of Argan oil I've seen, at the best price I've found.<br /><br />I love using this natural, organic, fresh oil on my skin. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized. I add a big squirt to my body lotion, rubbing my lotion and the oil together in my hands, before applying to my body. Wonderful. Hopefully I'll see more firmness with continued use.<br /><br />After reading the label, which suggests using 1-3 drops on the face, I realize I've been using way too much product. I'm probably using about 12 drops just on my face and neck. But it smells so fresh and natural that I love slathering it on.<br /><br />I don't really have wrinkles, I have fine lines. I've been using this for about 2 weeks so and it seems to soften the fine lines. I'm using this together with the Instanatural Vitamin C serum, which I bought at the same time. I'll try to post a review on the Vitamin C serum after I've used it a bit longer.
B00KBFTZCS|4|My main interest was in using this as a sort of mini-infinity scarf. I wanted to be able to put a clean-looking geometric black and white chevron design near my face, without the bulk and warmth (and cost) of most scarves on the market. It looks pretty on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Soft fabric<br />- True white, true black<br />- The elastic is firm<br />- I really like the way the  fabric makes a folded loop over itself. That's an unusual feature and looks quite nice. This gives me presentation options for wearing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's too small for my adult-size head. If I ever wanted to wear this as a headband, I'd get a headache in half an hour.<br />-The construction is rather cheap. The stitches are a bit big and loose, and the fabric is a fragile sort of thin nylon. I think asking $7 for this is too high - it's more like a Dollar Tree item.<br /><br />Note:<br />I would hand wash this as needed - don't toss it into even a gentle cycle on a washing machine.<br /><br />Overall:<br />If I were rating this as a headband, I'd give it 2 stars.  It's just too tight and uncomfortable. But as a small scarf, it's cute and makes a nice accessory to mix into my wardrobe. I'd recommend it as a quick and easy adornment item; a form of cloth jewelry.
B001GIOV8C|5|wonderful
B004WSXD4G|4|I think this a very good product. It worked for me but once you finish the lotion it comes back you have to keep using it I guess for better results
B005UKT9LG|5|This Collection has colors for all skin tones.  It has a combination of matte and shimmer colors.  All of the colors appear to blend well. This will let you combine for many diferent looks. This collection is great if you like the smokey eye look in different colorings.  I myself use this one for the smokey eye looks because of the amount of great dark colors it has in it.  I would tell any woman to get this collection, they will not be disappointed with it. Remember the colors are highly pigmented so a little goes a long ways.  The colors also last a long time. A really great collection.  Linda W.
B00CP7BYPG|4|Definitely softens and helps control the beard, but don't expect a heavy duty molding cream. The moisturizing and conditioning is top notch but i sometimes have to use a thicker gel or hair paste to help control this steel wool beard. (might be more of a personal problem). Highly recommended.
B00KHYH50W|5|Bought these for my daughter, and she loves them.
B00TGQWFH0|3|I've heard a lot of buzz about the makeup blender and this product so I tried this one.  Compared to the regular sponge, I thought this would offer something more special.  It blends as well as other types of sponges.
B00015EBL8|5|I've been using the conditioner for over a year now and have been really pleased and thrilled with the product.  Granted it took a bit to get use to since I started out using to much, but now I've learned that I only need about a dime size in my palm, that's because their shampoo doesn't dry out my hair.  I receive numerous compliments on how nice my hair smells and looks.
B0030HNV6K|4|this was for a friend in christmas. he loved it he told me is strong to hold his hair so i believe is good.
B00AW3EGOG|5|I will be buying these in many more colors, very sturdy, put together very well. And absolutely adorable in your hair, love it!
B008R6DUJW|5|Another small make up kit, easy to take in bag.  Has great color variety.  Good for someone like me who randomly wears make up or doesn't wear make up.
B00LI3GY9Y|1|I was given one of these by a friend.  I found that it leaked, and that the strap needed constant adjustment between early and late AM shower, and again if I needed one for a late afternoon shower.  It could only be made to fit by punching holes in the strap.  Rather than 'ruin' a product that SHOULD work with 80% or more of the population, I bought another one,  the kind that looks like a 'nose' that fits with Velcro in the back.  I then saved this one for someone who could benefit from one - I mean we are each different. So a bit later I was able to give it away in a 'Welcome' package' many groups of Larynjectomees give to 'new-be' to make their life easier.  This gentleman found that his neck size varied so much from early AM to PM that he had to punch two holes so close together that with a month the silicone rubber stretched enough that the two holes, the AM hole and the PM hole had stretched SO much that they were now one hole. Yet, as with me, there was NO way to set the tension of the collar close enough together that they would work with his 1/4 inch or so neck change between first thing in the AM and the PM (when he might have to shower before an evening meeting) that they had stretched together to form ONE LONG ELONGATED hole that would not work in the AM or the PM. Since the holes would always hold the guard far enough away from his neck to allow shower water to flow from the back of his head, - soap or shampoo in it as well, straight into his stoma. He mentioned to me that he always had trouble getting the hole to line up and match behind his neck, that he (a self proclaimed Neanderthal)  said he'd formed a FAR better appreciation of his wife's ability to negotiate clipping together a necklace.  When he mentioned this problem to his ENT surgeon, the surgeon said to ABSOLUTELY NOT USE IT - that it formed a pathway for bacteria to run from his hair and neck straight into his lungs.  The surgeon also mentioned that getting one with a Velcro strap might, seriously, save his life from either bacterial pneumonia, or from a kind of 'aspiration' pneumonia  which was not caused by bacteria (and could be treated) and the kind of pneumonia that was caused by chemicals (soap, shampoo, body wash) which would only function to pull fluid out of his blood and into his lungs, leaving him with, at best a life-time of lungs which tried to drown him in his own body fluid, or at worst, kill him slowly over time, but that his death would be painless and without a lot of sufferig save the constant need to feel to cough.  I am sorry I gave this as a 'preset' to a new-be Larynjectomee, rather than just throw it out in the trash as a dangerous piece of 'medical' equipment. ----------------------------- In this day and age we are all FAR TOO FAMILIAR WITH MEDICAL HYPE -- and because it did not work for me, and because it did not work for a friend, I have to warn people that this is NOT to be used by ANY larynjectomee who does not have years of experience in how to deal with dangerous fluids (water+soap, water+shampoo, etc.) when they first enter you lungs.  The ONE good thing my friend mentioned to me was that he sure learned how to cough hard and deep, as well as how to cough by allowing the slower to flow into his stoma and thus flush out and dilute the soap and shampoo which he, and his physician both felt may have saved his life.<br /><br />In short, while it did not work for me, it was something  felt I could trust to a friend - today I can say I could not even recommend it to a friend, and would ask that you find a shower guard with a Velcro strap so you can use it in the AM and PM - and on good days and bad days, days when your neck is swollen between sizes of holes and when your neck begins to heal and is, again, shrunk between holes.  The fix is NOT to put in another hole, as the strap will stretch and eventually you'll end up with one large oblong hole, rather than two holes close together to use for the size of your neck that varies from AM to PM, not to mention was your neck swells from surgery or swells back up from a common old or flu.<br /><br />Look for the kind with the Velcro strap and which looks more like a nose.

B00DD6DCK8|5|I was at first reluctant to try this product because of the review below. I also saw this product recommended on maskcara.com and since it only costs $10 I thought I would give it a try. At first I was shocked when the \\"mouse\\" came out watery and super dark, almost black. This consistency actually helped me rub it in my skin evenly allowing me to see where exactly I was applying it. Also, I do highly recommend you using an application glove or mitt because it will stain your hands when applying. I made sure to apply moisturizer on my knees, elbows, and ankles to keep these areas from getting dark with the tanning product. Tanwise was pretty easy to apply and it worked great! After one application, I saw a subtle tan that even my husband noticed. This product is wonderful for a subtle tan or you can apply another coat the next day for a deeper tan. This is going to replace my Jergans Natural Glow! Also, to help it dry faster, I cheated and quickly turned my blow dryer on low heat for a few seconds all over my body. It did get on my socks just a little bit when I did not wait long enough to put them on the other night but it washed right out.
B00JEZ0T26|5|I love the tanning mousse.  It is my go to self tanner for summer.  The smaller size is expensive for the amount you get, but because I was flying I couldn't take anything larger.  The mousse goes on easily (be sure and wear gloves) and the color is great.
B001DYK74G|5|Super super soft! Must wash a few times first just like the directions say to. Very pleased.
B000C1VWIQ|5|Delivered on time, and smells great!
B004BG6B2U|2|This stuff was a gooey mess, I sent it back.
B004JTICBM|5|Beautiful color, flattering -- and long-lasting wear.  Just what one needs from a lipstain.  And mostly natural ingredients.  A simple gloss on top gives you the moisture if you need.
B00R2L69EG|4|My teeth were whiter in minutes! Crest Pro Health HD worked so fast I couldn't believe it. The toothpaste tastes great, your breath smell kissably fresh, and makes your teeth feel dentist office clean. The gel makes your teeth whiter the first use. They get whiter and whiter everyday. By the third week they were three shades whiter. I'm super impressed. I will purchase this. It's my new go to toothpaste. The only con is my gums became sensitive after a week or so. The pros by far outweigh the cons. Best part of it all I got to try it for free from Crest and Bzz
B0045K1N8E|4|Shipped pretty quick and does was it's suppose to do. You need to apply thin coats or else it will not cure correctly. You also need to buy your own brush to apply this product.
B005C2NAKS|5|I got a free sample of this at a health fair I attended and had to buy some. It smells wonderful and make my skin feel fantastic.
B000NJMSXU|4|Wash my face twice a day. Wanted a washcloth that would be easy to launder, yet inexpansive and plentiful. Does the job.
B00LYLJJO2|5|I have always had problems with ingrown hair. These tweezers work quite well for extracting these hair (rather than near the surface or buried deeper). The pointer ones work super well for pulling the hair out once I've unburied it, and the flatter ones work well for getting to it. Love them, high recommend if you have ingrown hairs too
B0045U2Z72|5|good
B00464BZ6O|2|Shipping was pretty fast, but the packaging was not good. When I opened it up the purse was folded and wrinkled. So I figured I would put some items in it to try and get the wrinkles out. This did not really help. And besides the bad packaging, it wreaked of a foul chemical smell that made my nose burn. I tried airing it out but it still wreaks of that smell. The handles look cheaply sewn on. The pendant was cute, but that's the only thing. I was expecting it to be a little better, especially for $27.<br />If you're thinking about getting it I would say save your money. You can definitely get a better one for just $8 more. The official Sanrio Hello Kitty embossed purses are much better quality and hold their shape.
B007US0CEY|5|it was exactly what I was looking for.
B00008PC1O|5|Works great even on my dark brown hair.  Have been getting a lot of compliments
B001M5UEBW|5|Safari by Ralph Lauren for Women has been my favorite scent for years. I haven't seen it in the stores for a very long time so I was delighted to find it through Amazon.
B00J97OA10|5|Lovely hairpins and clip are just the perfect accessory for my daughter's Elsa costume!!  She loves them!
B002O0D8P8|5|i love this product and i got half as much again of this project as i can buy locally for the same product. great packaging. great service. i will order again.
B001CTQMIC|5|The one I've used so far, since January, is still in one piece, hasn't fallen apart, is still tightly compacted and lathers galore! I like the ribbon hanger on it too. The colors are very nice. I like knowing that I have more, in case I need them. Nice buy and a bargain!<br /><br />Don't hesitate on these! They're work the $6. Trust me, they are!
B0038TVHGG|2|I have bought this product at Target and I am not totally convinced that their ingredient list is accurate. The results of this product are somewhat decent (which is why I gave it a 2 star instead of 1), but feels and smells like there is more to it than \\"natural ingredients\\". My scalp itches like crazy after using this shampoo and the conditioner. That usually only happens when there is synthetic fragrances or chemicals in the product. Makes me wonder....
B00AAICFJ6|1|Burns
B0046DCFI2|5|Best smell ever and I love the anti-bactieral factor.
B000E8XBSG|5|I love this face soap - it cleans well without drying out your skin and will remove make-up gently.
B001F8HY0U|1|This gel did not work at all. I got a lot more relief from Icy Hot
B00HG8AZEA|1|By far, too small.
B0006PLOQS|1|As far as I can tell, this nail file does a decent job of filing--but I cant be sure because it's torture to use it! It feels like scratching your nails down a chalk board -- literally. Every time I try to use it, I get that unbearable cringe in my bones that only nails-on-a-chalkboard (especially when it's YOUR nails) can bring about. But not only does it FEEL awful, it actually MAKES that dreadful, squeaking sound too. Save your money (and your sanity) and go buy a less nerve-grating product.
B001B1W2DU|5|This product is great! I came across it in an Ulta discounted section years ago, though I have been ordering it on Amazon ever since. I have received countless comments on the look and the scent this product gives my hair. Highly Recommend!
B0058SY1X6|1|Charged the clippers out of the box and used for three haircuts.  It won't recharge and cannot be used plugged in either.  I've had three Wahl clipper units.  The best one is the oldest and cheapest one I have.  So much for product development.
B004KTL0VA|5|Excellent hold without flaking.  I have short coarse hair and this has been perfect in holding my natural curl for days.
B0012813UA|5|I really like this conditioner! It has a good scent although it could be a little more minty. Still, for the price it's a great buy for those of us with oily or fine hair. Rich and creamy too...no need to worry about it being wasted running down the shower!
B00SVYCD7U|5|Love this product
B001G5FOLI|4|Took awhile to get here from Thailand. Very sharp.
B004UQ6Q62|5|My husband says that it is much much better for skin and faster than shaving with blades and foam. But he has to finish shaving  with blade because this shaver doesn't work conveniently on the neck
B00W6FE3EG|4|As soon as I got this I cleaned it using a toothbrush and a little jojoba oil. Never use water on wood combs, they will splinter and start to rot. The oil acts as a coating so if I wanted to run it through wet<br />hair it wouldn't retain any water. It's not widetooth. It fact it's has fine teeth. If I had bigger tangles I had to take a little more time just like any other comb but my hair felt better and layed nicer than my usual wide tooth plastic comb. For reference I do not blow dry or use styling products on my hair to keep it as healthy as possible and I think this comb, being a really good price, will help with that. Arrived less than 2 weeks after purchase, so well before the expected arrival date.
B001GIOV7S|3|The product had a 2005 copyright. The one I was replacing it with had 2015. So, I guess they are selling their old shelf leftovers. The product still smells and works the same though.
B001JQLNFU|4|If these lasted a bit longer for the money I'd give 5 stars, Less razor burn than with other razors, but for the price I wish they lasted another week or two...
B00DHSIR4I|5|It did not coms yet, but I know I love it.
B0085RZLQ8|4|Sometimes store brand substitutions are not worth the savings. Though clunky and harder to clean then other leading brands, I would recommend not purchasing the store brand &#34;its good enough to work&#34; and just spend the extra few dollars on the real heads. They fit properly and wont stop with the slightest of pressure.
B00SW8CFLE|5|Great mask and cleanser.  Love that it is all natural. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. This gave me NO trouble. Skin felt so very soft after. I have used on elbows and heels to soften them.
B001FSG9M4|2|I guess that's what I get for not testing perfume before I buy, I was totally intrigued by the name and the artistic description made by the seller, I was super sad that the real smell is close to what I would describe as grandma and stale soap, super sad, but... The bottle is super cool.
B007YQUSKA|4|This is a lovely greenish-blue with gray undertones.  It is just a little bit greener and a little bit grayer than depicted here.  In bright light, the blue shows more; in dimmer light it's almost gunmetal gray with a strong hint of blue.  I thought I'd use it with my reds to make a fun Fourth of July themed manicure, but it's not blue enough for that.  That said, it's the same quality as any other polish from this line in terms of wear.
B003QOZ2C8|5|Just put one of these into your next order and give it to your wife.     It's more thoughtful than you know.  It says, \\"I bought you the good stuff.  You're beautiful and deserve the best.  I don't want you to get skin cancer.\\"      Not greasy.  Not dry.
B000065DJY|5|My daughter loves this blow dryer. She loves the color, the ionic of the blower, and the attachments especially the diffuser.<br />The price was great and it was shipped in a very timely manner.
B009S1V36W|5|The best head and shoulders, made in France. It works better on you..
B00BQ553QE|5|I've been using this product for almost two months now, and my moderate acne has shown great improvement. I've tried creams, oral medication, masks, home remedies, just about everything I can think of to help, and my skin looked better in only one week using this product, following the suggested regimen for the kit exactly.<br /><br />I have seen some dryness, but I use a moisturizer every other night or so, sometimes petroleum jelly for specific dry spots with peeling (this extent of dryness hasn't been common for me, mainly &#34;user error&#34; from using too much of step 3). I don't put anything additional on my face until all steps in the kit are complete and my face is dry.<br /><br />I've had no cystic acne since I started with Acnefree, and maybe two or three bad zits (it's hard to remember since for once, it's an infrequent event!). The rest of my blemishes have been normal whiteheads and blackheads, and those too appear to be fewer. My scarring is clearing up, although overall this product isn't doing much for discoloration (not that it promised to do so). I'd love a good recommendation for that.<br /><br />This may not work for everyone, but after years of searching for something that works for me, I've found it! I would definitely recommend giving this a try if you haven't found the right solution for you.
B005QZQ9JU|4|This is a great idea in skin care. Easy to use. didn't care much for the fruity wash-I can't deal with scented things that well, but the other wash that came with it is great. Trying to find the refills in stores is a little hard-item not that available yet. But Clearasil lives up to its history-clean skin w/o overdrying and keeps breakouts under control. So far so good.
B00685KUGA|4|Best product ever. Clear my face of acne highly recomendes.
B002BAJ3X2|5|3rd time buying and love it just as much!! Grapefruit is my favorite scent!
B001SERK9G|1|This does nothing for my skin, Ive given it a chance for two months and nothing. I wish I could find Pretika MD170 for a reasonable price, the scrubber I used before this one, but it looks like they discontinued it and now want to charge way to much for it.
B00CWDBMSM|5|excellent product and high quality ingredients, goes on easily , absorbs quickly and my skin is clearer and more radiant
B0082D69PM|5|My favorite and it is getting hard to find.
B00I1HAQDK|5|I received this deodorant complimentary of Influenster! I use this everyday and I love it. Longest lasting deodorant I've ever used (and i've tried em all). I became a believer after using it out of the shower in the morning and after going to the gym, work (I deliver mail), and watching a late night movie I to wake up the morning with great smelling pits! It doesnt leave any irritation marks or cause any itching, it's not cold, sticky, or powdery. I use it everyday for anything (hiking, gym, work, and occasions where I have to dress up). Highly recommended for any guy on the go.
B003UOVWGY|5|My husband has used this product for years.  It's perfect for his hair.  Was happy to find it again.  Great product.
B007HT5ZB6|3|I have just started to use this product so I haven't really noticed a difference yet. But, I am still waiting for the good, citrus smell mentioned by some reviewers.  The bottle I got smells more like used motor oil!  Guess I'll wait to see if it works before I dump it.
B0012ZMBDQ|4|as you probably know if you're reading this, the stuff they put in most sunscreens is bad news (oxybenzone) - it interacts with your skin chemistry to chemically block the sun, but it messes with your hormones,<br />this sunscreen (and a few others on the market) don't use it. instead they work like old-school sunscreen, with an actual metal barrier material (zinc oxide usually). usually these leave a white layer on your skin. doesn't bother me but some people don't like it.<br />it stays on pretty well, and once it's rubbed in it doesn't feel nasty.<br />only drawbacks are it's expensive (this is the best deal I've found for zinc oxide sunscreen).<br />the other drawback is that it seems to be whole food's default brand - which isn't Badger's fault, but I try to avoid having anything to do with whole foods or the companies they carry.
B00GMN0WNO|2|Not for sensitive skin<br />Too much perfume in the product
B004XLR744|5|This really does work!  I have tried other brands but Tea Tree Solution For Nails Thursday Plantation is much superior.
B005HGWHF8|5|really works well.my nails were very damaged by artficial nails and schlacking. This product has made them so strong and healthy I will never go back to artificial nails. And Ihave already purchased more so I wont run out.
B00BG9K176|5|This product is great at keeping my hair in great condition.  My hair can be dry and coarse without any product before drying but some hair oils leave it too oily.  This one is perfect, leaving my hair soft and shiny.  I love the fragrance but it is VERY strong...to me it's similar to Juicy Couture.  So if you like a fresh floral or a fruity fragrance this is probably not the best pick for you.
B0048F5ATO|4|good
B000UVZU1S|5|Very nice facial moisturizer. I have dry skin, and this affordable moisturizer works perfectly well for me. Really worth the price!
B004XERFZW|5|I bought this oil and another to mix together to help keeps ticks from attacking my husband. It seemed to work. I also put the mixture on my dog and we haven't found any ticks on him.
B000F63TW0|2|I have this, and honestly, it does nothing for me. Save your money for a TCA peel you can buy on here. They are sooo amazing! I was so glad I found them on Amazon! (Much less expensive than going to my aesthetician).<br /><br /> The results of the Olay peel don't even begin to compare to a TCA peel, which you can find on Amazon easily. Go for a very very low % TCA peel, and you WILL see results.<br /><br />I dooo LOVE:<br /><br />NOT SMOKING (kills your skin and tans it like leather). NOT TANNING. I can spot a smoker or tanner before they tell me they tan or smoke.<br /><br />Neutrogena SPF 100 (  ^^ sun damage is 90%  )<br />Olay Regenerist Serum (so awesome)<br />Olay Scrubbing Brush (exfoliation is #2)<br />Melloderm cream application to dark spots<br /><br />I used to work at Sephora, and I'm sorry, we can sell you skin cream all day long, but if you smoke and tan,  say hello to Early Aging. Bronzer is your friend. TRICK: If you look at your bottom in the mirror, that's how good your skin could look if you didn't tan.
B004WB6M6E|5|This is the only shampoo that works for me as far as dry, itchy,flaky winter scalp goes. I started to panic when I discovered Body shop discontinued it. I have tried everything including prescription shampoos, scalp tonics etc. I was so happy and relieved to find it on Amazon. It is gentle on your hair yet takes care of my scalp issues.
B00280LRZW|5|Why would you possibly need a professional grade trimmer for your nose, ears and eyebrows? The answer is that you probably shouldn't but do. This is really the only one that works and won't break after a few uses. The circular ones sold by Panasonic, etc look great but don't work all that well, no matter how expensive. And the cheaper linear ones may look like the Valera but they are basically crap and break after only a few uses. So your choice is, either deal with a hairy nose and ears, keep buying flimsy drug store trimmers or bite the bullet and get this bad boy. For me, the answer was clear.
B002WVBEH8|4|This is great!  I've been storing my nail polish in a shoe box and finally realized I needed to have a better storage solution so I ordered this and mounted it on the wall in my closet, next to my vanity.  It holds a LOT of polishes!  More than I have, and I thought I had too many.<br /><br />You will need screws to mount this.
B003983I1S|5|I love Gillette! I've been using the Mach 3 Power for as long as I can remember. Its been real good to me even though I don't shave all that often. You see, I hate to shave. I've grown a beard because of how much I dislike it. So the only time I really shave is when there is a special occasion. Well today I have to go to a wedding. I figured this was a great time to try out the new Fusion Power Blades I got for free from Gillette through this great promo. WOW! These blades are amazing. Smooth shave in a quick amount of time. Goodbye Mach 3 Power, I've fallen for another. It didn't even feel like I was shaving. The best part was I didn't have to keep going over the same spot to make sure it was a close shave. My tender face is very happy about that. I would recommend these blades to anyone.
B00314UJQW|5|I love this scent, but it's hard to find good prices.  Found a good deal on amazon compared to store prices.
B00B1N6XME|3|The product is pretty cheap, but look what at the price, right? I do use a few of them, but they don't wear long. I don't think they have minerals. Seller did deliver in appropriate packaging within a very fast amount of time, though. Thank you.
B00OBRKM24|5|Good!
B0087HWF0Q|5|I dont use the brush, I use the pen part of it, and it works awesome. Its easy to use and makes it easy to do designs on my nails.
B007M81A6Q|5|This stuff is great, it makes my skin look flawless.
B00B1ZRTP2|2|too chalky, no pigment
B008XBGNDG|4|This looks like a good value purchase, nevertheless I haven't unpacked it yet, so you better keep reading reviews. lol
B000HVT8AA|5|I purchased this blow dryer about a couple of years ago and I really like this blow dryer. It doesn't dry out my hair.
B001A0WLTW|5|Great product for color treated hair. Love it!
B00G5L89JM|3|The area between the replacement head and the toothbrush doesn't seal perfectly so it creates an area were mold grows.  I now keep it apart and clean it with vinegar often.  Beware of this issue.
B001ET76AI|4|Good product. Will recommend. The bottle loses its potency within a month of being open but until then works very well.
B0084SQ7AW|5|it worked great
B00EEK01BK|5|I got these as a points gift from Sephora. The girl at the counter said they were good.<br />Well, I had used them 3 times and holy c*@p!! What a difference in my skin after only 3 uses. It now feels like porcelain, I have a couple of dark spots from sun damage and it looks like those are lightening a bit as well already. With foundation on to cover those, my skin now also looks like porcelain. So I have now ordered them. I can't wait to see what continued use does. I am in my late 40's and people already thing I am in my 30's, wonder if with continued use of these they will start guessing 20's? LOL<br />They are fantastic,
B00LY60K68|3|i received this product in two days and that was awesome. For the price, I expected more from the product. I've used most of Camille rose products and this product does not compare. My hair was tangled and unmanageable. This cowash does not detangle or have any slip. Not impressive. Yes it removed build up, and that is it. I do love Camille rose conditioner deep algae renew. I also love the coconut leave in conditioner. Both leave my hair soft and manageable. Do not waste your money on this cowash. Shea moisture and As I am cowash is better and cheaper.
B00NTB6CPE|3|They are nice quality brushes, but I don't notice any special detangling properties in the detangling brush.  The bristles are easy to clean though on the detangling brush because they are straight with no rounded ends.
B000C1Z214|4|A very sensual & erotic scent. I have tried Blv many times, but it never spoke to me. This flanker does. It is dark, mysterious. It's got a bit of a boozy note. Like drinking champagne in bed. I really enjoy this one. Wears close to the skin and could be worn every day. A grower and definitely worth sampling, if not buying.
B000AV1E8G|5|I really love this product. The competitions' blotting paper (Walgreens brand, Neutrogena) are made would literally stick to my skin and slide. The paper really soaks in oil and the layer of powder conveniently adds a touch of power to the oily areas and removes the shine instantly.
B002VECKH4|5|I have used these products for years and will continue to use them.  Will be ordering again when I need more.
B00AR86EF0|5|I LOVE these so much, I ordered more. They're so easy to apply, look GREAT & stay put. I needed to move some of them more than once before I was able to permanently place them. THEY DID NOT TEAR NOR FALL APART. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ;-) ;-) ♡
B0018A32XS|4|I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter and it is perfect for her.  Easy to use, easy to charge and it comes with a travel case and small brush, which is great for when she goes to summer camp.  She hasn't tried it as a 'wet' shaver yet, but I like that it is versatile and can be a wet or dry shave.
B00I5H5Z1O|5|Great size and very easy-to-use.  It conforms to your hand to give you a nice clean shave.
B001T0HHB0|5|Works great when switching from my husbands to my sons hair.
B005QDL1K4|5|I've been using these to help shape my eyebrows. They work well, and you can't beat the price for how many you get.
B00620OO0E|1|SO disappointing!  The new formulation is blue green, makes the water look cold and dirty before you ever even get in.  The nice bubbles of the past are gone; although it does still create bubbles, they are about 1/2 the volume.  The smell is different, but to me, not as different as other reviewers have stated.<br /><br />The same thing has occurred with badedas.  SO SAD.<br /><br />This has been a favorite for decades.  The current product is either not authentic or the formulation has changed.  What a horrible decision!
B00EAN0HUQ|5|it's so cute and so long &#60;3
B00F5BJ64U|4|I am tempted to joke, &#34;It slices, it dices...&#34;, but that would be inappropriate! It does what it is supposed to do and can be fun.
B0097G3XDY|3|I bought this product for my mom and she reports to be that it doesn't really seem to be helping her.
B004L4EING|4|Pretty nice set. The brush is soft and the bowl is heavy. I use a different soap, but it comes with a large puck.
B003607ZNG|5|This is my go to scrub ever since a friend recommended it a couple years back. It has a subtle smell, good level of abrasion, and doesn't destroy and overdry my face. I use it twice a week in the shower. It gives my face a nice little tingle. While it doesn't overdry, you do need to put on a moisturizer after regardless to get the maximum benefit. Will be using this for the forseable future.
B00PPCVIR2|1|After reading other reviews I thought this would be a good product and a cheaper solution than going to a professional. Unfortunately I have not been able to get it to work as described. A red light comes on but as far as I'm concerned it is no laser. There is no heat at all, so none of the &#34;elastic band snap&#34; sensation that I was expecting and no hair was removed. I tried for a good 30mins, pushing the button in different ways, holding it on, depressing and releasing quickly, red light, no effect. It might as well be a red diode on an action figure remenicent of Buzz Lightyear.
B000NG90NE|5|Love this color and OPI
B005JE24RO|5|I have never ordered any of my hair extensions from Amazon but I have bought this same brand of extensions for 4 years, they are AMAZING!! I am constantly receiveing compliments. I wear them everyday, so they are curled and straightened and still hold up amazingly. I can't say enough good things about this brand of hair extensions. The picture shown is NOT the color they are, if you don't know your color already go onto the Bobbi Boss website to check and see what color you need.
B00H5UP96I|3|Did not do anything for my skin other than made it peel very bad.
B000UGZDCY|5|Loved the way it evened out my skin tone.
B001E1XWCM|4|Item arrived on time and as described.
B00006JN4R|4|I have naturally dark brown hair that I have had dyed to a dirty blond for several years. Wanting to save money and dye my hair myself I purchased L'Oreal Paris Superior Preference in LB-02. While it did lighten my hair drastically it turned out extremely brassy/orange/yellow. My 8 year old says it is GOLD! I bought two boxes and I am thinking of applying the second box in a few days with the hopes of lightening it more without frying it. Others complained about the smell, but I thought it was quite nice with the exception of making my eyes water (which happens at the salon anyway). The conditioner is amazing and leaves my hair super soft and smelling nice as well. I would recommend this to someone wanting to lighten their already light brown/dirty blond hair, but probably not to someone with dark brown hair like myself (unless you like screaming orange)! By the way, my friends now call me \\"Sunny\\" :) At least I can laugh about this!
B00006592X|5|My old one finally quit and this one is even better.  I mostly use this on my underarms, it eliminates that gray shadow and cuts down on shaving.  I periodically use on my legs and bikini line during the summer.  Once the hair is softer and thinner, after the initial use, it isn't so painful... or maybe I am just used to it.
B004AIAVYS|5|Just a little dab will do ya!!! My dry skin was much, much better in just a couple of days.
B000H3GDYC|5|Good Stuff
B002EEQR2A|5|This product is divine.! So good for your skin, have even been using it in my hair and I cant recommend this highly enough. Seller posted this item very quickly and it was well packed. 5star rating for this item.!
B0092MCO88|1|The quality of this product is poor, very cheap plastic, loud motor, and drying time is slow.  The tube that attaches to the bonnet is tricky as you are doing it behind your head and if it rotates it might fall off.  I wish I had spent more money and bought a better product.  It seems to me that there is a lot of profit being made on this item because it delivers so little to the consumer.
B004Z209HS|5|I rarely write reviews although I depend on them tremendously when purchasing anything. I discovered Argan oil last year and have been using them daily. If you have dry skin Argan oil is really wonderful. I switched to Pura d'or because of the rave reviews. When I use it I do feel a difference than the brand I used to get. Pura d'or is thicker and somehow I feel the skin absorbs it faster, thus I actually need less amount of oil on my face than before. I love this product and this company now and their price for a 4oz bottle is terrific.
B0074EI6CE|5|I tried these on a friend's recommendation. My skin is on the dry side, especially during the winter. The mask was a little tricky getting it on the first time, but I got it figured out after the first try. Here's a tip: before putting it on, pull a little bit of the mask cover off; it'll make things easier. After getting it on, it's pretty easy to adjust by pulling on the edges. I was worried at first, but the material is stronger than it looks. After using the mask, my skin felt pretty soft and hydrated. I will probably end up using this more frequently during the winter, but it feels cool and refreshing when it's on, so I'll also use it during the summer.
B0047PGE4K|5|This Deneuve perfume was sold at a very reasonable price, since it's a very hard perfume to find any more.
B0061DPB04|5|I love this product!  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I am purchasing more today!  I love the way it makes my hair feel.  I don't know if it helps it grow yet, if it does I will update this review, but at any rate I am very happy with it and will make this my regular shampoo and conditioner and as long as it stays available I will continue to buy it.
B003CTTZQQ|5|After my hair was severely damaged from a sew in weave I started using JBC after perming my hair. My hair growth took off. I tried some other products like carols daughter but really didn't see any results. I use JBC 2-3 times a week after washing my hair and only applied it to my scalp. About 2-wks after perming my hair my hair started getting thicker and noticed new growth. I did use a moisturizer and sealed my ends with coconut oil but my growth only took off after using this product. Like some of the other girls I learned about JBC from You-tube. I started using it in Feb 2011 and now May 2011 I have a lot of new growth.
B00MYDWTBO|3|My friend told me about you'll product it made her grow and she told me about it I just brought a bottle for my hair.My edges coming out bad I hope it makes it grow fast.My hair been short for a while I hope my grow real fast when start taking it.
B002QQ7SZ6|4|I really like it, it really conditions hair and everything, but mineral oil. I didn't know that it had it in it, I knew that the non gold one had it, but I guess I should of figured this one had it in it to. So I wont be buying it again. I will just use virgin coconut oil when needed. I also have the dabur vatika oil which I do like, but I've heard on youtube and read recently that it can turn hair red. So I will just use my coconut oil after they are all used up.
B00AO7Q1Y8|3|not sure about it
B000ITJ0LI|4|excellent razor - particularly for the money -   Gives just as good (if not better) cut than my  expensive one...
B0038NQEOC|5|This product does restore moisture to any dry and/or brittle hair.  It is great in areas where the water quality interferes with the frizz factor of your hair.  You will not be disappointed.
B0073A8T4Y|4|Great coverage but the color was not right for my skin tone, and it too weeks to get here! Very long shipment ! Covers very well but color is hard to choose. A bit deceptive in that area. Otherwise great! Just a little hard to choose the right color. I LOVE IT EITHER WAY!!!!
B004CHF8AY|5|This was one of the first wigs I purchased for my investigative job. I have LOTS of hair but still managed to get it up under the wig with no problem. Stays in place well and so far no one has figured out it is a wig...hair is very soft and looks natural.
B000RIJ16O|5|Really good base for lipstick at a good value.  I always reorder when I'm out.  Lipstick stays put longer by using it.
B00GI1L068|5|Came earlier than stated & were a great oz per jar for the price.
B00GWEYFSG|2|Makes lots of noise on the 8240XL, I even changed blades and still the same
B00JH2B182|4|It's disappointing I can't put chap-stick over it because than it'll start to come off instead of staying but other than that I love it.
B000NVBK5U|4|When i use my ergo sit I can feel myself working needed muscles that help me sit up more straight
B00LXEF2UA|5|This is great stuff and started to work over night. It was shipped quick and is high quality. I would purchase again or recommend it to anyone with dark circles or puffiness under eyes. I love it and don't know what I have done without it all these years.
B003JM4OCG|5|I have used this product for years and am sorry it is not sold in the US any more.  This order came from England and arrived promptly from England.  No problems at all with the order.
B00NELG47U|5|This is a great toothbrush..  It charges up in 16hrs - lasts for about 2 weeks, and when used it leaves your teeth feeling CLEAN.  The extra settings to choose from Clean, Sensitive, and Massage cleaning modes is an extra special feature of this toothbrush.  It has the 2 minute setting to ensure that after 30 seconds you switch quadrants as per the established normal brushing time.  It comes with an extra head and the charger which doubles as a stand for the toothbrush.  It has a lightweight design.  I have used oral b in the past and this definitely is comparable.  For the price, I do not see how you can go wrong on this one.  5 stars.
B00GBZCK7O|5|These hairbows are ADORABLE and great quality!!! The flower is not too big but the perfect size. The colors are great! I highly recommend. Bought when my daughter was 1 month old and fit her then and still fits now at 4 mo old.
B00I2495QG|4|Hyaluronic Serum is all the rage these days. It is proven to help with wrinkles and dullness. This serum is a bit watery but seems to be a good one. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. This one seems to be a good one, and for the price is is really great. After a week, my skin is brighter and I look a bit rosier now!
B00479FP4Q|3|They smell so good and feel so good. But were too rough for my skin. As soon as I stopped using them I had no problems. Back to Dove and Olay moisturizer. Don't mess with a good thing.
B00FRDPRBW|4|I do not use a ton of products in my hair, so I usually make sure the products that I do choose to use are of good quality and pull their weight. My normal routine consists of an herbal shampoo & conditioner, followed by a heat protectant / anti-frizz spray, and then a heat source (curling iron, flat iron, blow dryer, etc.). That is it. When I change shampoos or products, I can tell instantly what impact they have on my hair. I have greasy hair, so I wash it every 24 hours or so.<br /><br />When I began using this product - I'm just over 1/2 way done with it - I really enjoyed how my hair would look when I would let it naturally dry overnight and then curl it the following morning. After about three days of this, however, I started to notice that my hair was heavier and greasier looking than normal, and it wasn't holding curl like it normally does. The fourth day I decided to wash my hair in the morning then blow dry it out. That was pretty fantastic looking, and I've kept doing that. It seems that the overall heat and brushing helps to get the oils all over my hair more so than just letting it air dry.<br /><br />Other than the build-up issue, I'm pleased with the product. The ingredient list is a bit long, as are most shampoos you look at. The smell is great and lingers but not in a sickly-perfume type way. Would recommend to purchase once or twice per year to change things up.
B00J7Q1AV6|5|The material and design of these are fantastic. I know, nail clippers, but still.. they are very solid feeling and extremely durable.
B00CD1QU80|4|I have only used the flip-up trimmer on the reverse but it did exactly what I wanted and needed it to do. Item was already charged and ready to use.
B005V3W036|5|Upon opening this oil, it was very strong. It has the pure scent that real vanilla has. I liked it for the purity, and when I put lemon, orange, and about 6 drops of this in my diffuser, I am in love. It will only be 'too strong' if you do not dilute it, and when you dilute it the strong scent dissipates and the lovely vanilla is there. It is definitely pure vanilla, and isn't a synthetic fragrance oil like most of these negative reviews are really expecting. If you want vanilla that smells like vanilla candles and cake then you should get vanilla fragrance oil. I still think this smells wonderful and I'm very relaxed right now as I diffuse this vanilla in my room.
B00OQJW2MU|5|Love these for loose powder in the face .
B002JPJ2ZS|1|I took the regular strength vivisical for about a year and stopped.  I wasn't sure if it had done anything for me or not so I decided to take a break and see what happened.  I still wasn't sure so I decided to try the vivisical again but this time got the extra strength.  All I can say is watch out!  There is something in this formula that really upset my digestive tract and caused major bloating and discomfort.  At one point I thought I was having chest pain from the esophageal burning it produced.  So... if you are at all sensitive like I am stick with the regular strength if it's still available.  This was a huge waste of money for me and I wanted to be sure to let others know that it could be a problem for them as well.
B002QANC2A|5|Great eyeshadows!! Super pigmented and affordable. I had bought the shimmer palette a few years ago, its lasted forvever and I use it frequently, its also great quality! Better than my Sephora and Mac ones.
B00EXY4ZUA|4|amazing product !!
B0069SQVK0|5|I first used this product when I received it in a set of oils.  It is great!  I had to order more so went with the 30 ml.  It has helped me to fight off colds/flus this season.  I haven't been sick yet.  I mainly use it on my feet with a carrier oil, both day and night.  I also have diffused it.  Love this product!
B000OOKS22|5|FANTASTIC PRODUCT! (used from my 30's--thru to present,-early 40's) Although I feel I over-paid for this item on here,- (& I live in NY where EVERYTHING is expensive!) BUT on here now, vendors seem to be &#34;price-gouging&#34; a bit now, due it this item being discontinued--It had normally sold for $8-$13!--&I paid $20 here!!!-PLUS SHIPPING! But anyway,- Ive used this product since I was in my early 30's when, while on Vacation, a combination of &#34;Sun + Antibiotics&#34; caused a condition leading to a horribly spotted face!!- & I needed to &#34;cover it&#34; (realistically) without looking like it was applied with a trowel,-& quickly! Bought it in the local drugstore,-&This stuff worked,and I was also amazed at how &#34;flawless&#34; looking my make-up and face appeared! (Almost like when you'd see the Soap-Stars on TV &#34;back in the day&#34;!..lol- (Im now in my early-mid 40's) and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I get SUPURB COVERAGE-- or-- as LITTLE as I want! --depends upon MY Technique& needs that day... And for ANYONE who COMPLAINS about &#34;Spraying it directly on the face&#34;--- this is NOT like using an &#34;air-compressor/gun&#34;--this spray-nozzle is NOT DESIGNED for THAT type of supremely-fine application by any stretch of the imagination!- HOWEVER-- I find when I spray into my hand and apply from there,(in layers for extra coverage)--it goes on FLAWLESS, SEAMLESS, and does NOT sit in any creases, or wrinkles!! (For &#34;what its worth&#34; - I am a [retired] licensed cosmetologist..) I AM VERY UPSET SALLEY HANSON saw fit to drop this product from its line!!-(or mess with its formula and sell it as a similarly-labeled-product-- nothing else in their line (or anyone else's) at this price point, compares to this product!! ---(and NO, you can't substitute the &#34;legs&#34; version for your face lol! --yes, I tried! LOL) So grab em if u can,-- Im able to make my can last an entire SOLID YEAR with CAREFUL, STRATEGIC, JUDICIAL, APPLICATION!!! (After THAT, idk what brand I'll start using) but paying $20+ for foundation may be something I'll have to start doing now that I've &#34;crossed the threshold&#34; & waved &#34;good-bye&#34; to 39+!!  lol ;)hat brand I'll start using) but paying $20+ for foundation may be something I'll have to start doing now that I've &#34;crossed the threshold&#34; & waved &#34;good-bye&#34; to 39+!!  lol ;)
B008O4YM4Y|5|I love this hair brush! It feels like your getting a massage lol.
B004JOW5CY|4|Nice.  I just prefer another brand.
B00789UP8S|4|it was packaged nicely and it you go a lot of product in the bottles for a full head of hair... i did this on 28 inches hair...... 4 bundles
B00HNKRYP4|5|My husband is a full time student, and one of his classes this semester is gym. After he gets done in the class, he takes a quick shower before heading to his next class. We found that having a can of the Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion in his bag is very handy. Due to the fact that he is in a hurry to get to his next class after gym, he found he can keep his skin soft and keep it from drying out after gym class by quickly spraying on the lotion and heading out! I also enjoy the scent, which is a fresh scent that smells great on my husband!
B000NT2EE8|5|I have used this product for years and have never been disappointed.  Amazon keeps this stocked and the price is very reasonablie.  Highly recommended for all skin types and problem areas.  I will buy this again and again.
B0089XPUXM|5|I will always keep this product on board. It seems to work immediately for those under eye circles. I do not use this every day if just at home but is a must if going out.
B000OYPWN2|5|I Noticed a difference in my hair , after the very first use !! Will be buying a Bigger size next time for sure !!
B003AOF6UC|3|Comes with a clip. Worth the prize will wear for the neon run. I wish the clip was easier to hide within your hair.
B000OUBC8A|3|It's fine but its starts to get a little raggedy after owning it for sometime especially if you brush your hair in a wet state
B0047PPCAW|5|I have been using this product 2x sometimes 3x a day. I have really dry skin and this is amazing on my eyes! I have seen a difference with my dark circles. They look smoother + my makeup doesn't look flaky with this on.You have to keep in mind that its very thick so you can apply it then work on lotion or hair while it dries up.I will be buying this product again. Nothing better than having something that works and being organic!
B003FBI9LS|5|Best waver ever! Highly recommend it. I purchased it 3 times already for me and friends, who are also excited!
B00H4GYYOG|5|wish the cost would come down.  other than that not bad to swallow.
B00ESNRVGG|4|Bought this at the request of my elderly mother. Although it didn't work for the neuropathy in her feet she uses it for arthritis in her hands and says that it works wonders. She puts it on her hands like it's a hand lotion at night and it has provided her with relief through out the night. Overall I'm glad that I bought it for her.
B00080Q90M|5|Full-coverage and sun block all in one. I've been using it for years. I highly recommend it to anyone who is active and out in the sun a lot.
B00CHHJXYI|5|good price, good product, have been using them<br />since they came on the market. Leaves face<br />feeling clean, removes most everything.
B0014AARIK|3|I don't like the powder puff being apart from the powder.  The powder is okay, but it's a little to dark for me.  I would like a thinner compact without the bulk.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|This is just what I was hoping it would be.  Flossing was irritating my gums and deepening pockets between my teeth.  The Waterpik is great.  It removes food debris and massages my gums..  I look forward to using it.  I recommend using it at the 4 or 5 setting since the one time I tried it at 9, one of my crowns came off.  (The crown must have already become very loose and it was probably a good thing that it came off when using the Waterpik and not during a social situation.)
B00135DMG0|1|I bought this product from Costco the first time and loved it. Found it online and purchased it again. Very disappointed it was dried out. The formula Is definitely different. Not sure I will try it again.
B001MA0QY2|5|I haven't used this item yet, but it works and the presentation of the items is great!  Ive never seen so many items in one box for a flst iron.  I'm glad I purchased this item, now I need to see how long it can endure.
B009DU4QYE|4|I've ordered my second bottle of this shampoo. The condition of my scalp has seen improvement ever since I began using it. Before I started using it, my scalp had uncontrollable eruptions of pimples and now they are literally gone. I only get eruption once in a long while whenever I get nuts or other greasy foods. Although this product tends to cause dryness to the hair due to its degrease efficacy, I only use the conditioner at the lower end of my long hair, without allowing it to touch the top of my scalp, in order to eliminate any chance of exposing my scalp to the oil from the conditioner to avoid clogging up the pores on my scalp, thus reducing the chance of eruption.
B000277N88|5|Love the smell! Hubby loves it
B000II1OGI|5|I love this perfume, best part is, my husband does too! It's appropriate for both work & play. Not too heavy, yet still there several hours later.
B0014AV0WM|5|Fantastic  been using it just a week or so. I liked to have been using this for years! I will try some of your other products
B004Y9L4CG|5|love the brush..... really separates my eyelashes
B001KYNUKM|1|It is a micro liner indeed, and since the lead is thinner than your average pencil liners, the lead breaks off too easily. Not worth the price.
B002SW9KWM|5|Quality oil great for facials, hair, skin if you are not a fan of eating avocadoes.  I mix the oil in my hair conditioner.
B0090UJFYI|1|I had high hopes for this serum, after carefully reading all of the reviews, as well as reading in a magazine that hyaluronic serum holds up to 1000% its weight in water. Not only does it not hydrate my skin, I think it makes my skin even dryer. I've bought hundreds of products on Amazon, and this is the first time that I'm completely baffled by why something received so many glowing reviews. My advice: try something else!
B002N5MHLU|5|Finally a shaver that works. Best of all it takes only a couple of minutes to do a complete shave. Very pleased with Panasonic shavers. Beats the rest hands down.
B000NVWW8E|5|I love this cream, blends so easily & is a great color.  I previously used a powder blush that was discontinued so tried this & will never go back to powder blush!  I apply in the morning at home and it seems to last the day at work.
B00IBOJ1BG|5|If you've got a shag rug on your face like I do, you know what it's like. You drool in it while you sleep, soup and cereal milk dribble in, plus all the crumbs, gobs of sauce, ever try eating a bagel slathered with cream cheese shmear or god forbid an ice cream cone? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Napkins are a way of life, but clearly if you aren't shampooing all that nasty out every day, your wife ain't nuzzling her face in your chin and making you feel like a king, now is she? But all that washing strips out all the natural oils from your skin and your beard starts getting all splitty and rough feeling and plus you just want a little bit more, you know? Like let's get a head start on this stink by smelling awesome IN THE FIRST PLACE. So that's where your beard oil comes in. This one feels great, I drop about a nickel-to-quarter sized puddle into my hand after I get out of the shower, rub my hands together, and then massage them through my beard, chin and cheeks for a minute or so to work it in. Then I comb out my beard until I look like a Norse prince. The smell is very manly and I am getting that aforementioned face-nuzzling action every day. My beard pretty much always looks like I've spent years perfecting it, and it feels so soft and smooth even I want to touch it all the time. Highly recommended!
B004YNJ0MI|5|This product is true to what was advertised. It came before the expected shipping date and are great. I prefer the trial size to the full size since I can throw them away when they are old and I don't feel as if I'm wasting the entire tube.
B00LPVG6V0|5|Love this!
B0050HO9MI|2|Cheap, sharp edges, you get what you pay for.
B00L673JT0|1|I hate this thing. I have been stamping for a couple of years now and wanted a larger one for the larger prints. This think won't pick up anything and is so squishy, it just smooshes into the grip. Its cheap and definitely works like it is. Spend more to get a better one! Also, it took me two months to get it in the mail!!!
B0092MCMM6|2|I did not buy this through Amazon since my husband purchased it retail.  Seemed like a good dryer and all features are good, except, the hood will not stay in any position you set it for.  Once hot the hood will fall down.  I am using a wooden shim to keep it in the default position, which is too high so I have to hold it bent over in order to cover my head.  I would return this except we threw away box, receipt, etc.
B0079HNKLI|5|My favorite!
B00317FSMY|4|I recently bought the pink titanium hot tools waver.. let's just say it went back the next day. Then I purchased this one, is all I can say is I love it and so does my 12 year old daughter. The waver stays very hot, I have it set to the highest setting since my hair is really long and thick. The only down fall about this is the is very time consuming. It takes at least hour in a half to do all my hair, and it works much better on dirty hair verses clean hair. Very good product, and very happy with it.
B00HZ4BK5S|5|Gift for daughter and she loved it! Colors wear well.
B000NOFZTY|5|Good price and delivered safely
B004W2OQPC|5|Great product!
B004X1QKVU|2|Ok
B000NYN3ZW|5|[[ASIN:B0013AZ8H6 Osis + Elastic Flexible Hold Hairspray 9.1 oz]]  Absolutely clean and wonderful hold. No flaking, no frozen hair, great fragrance.
B007A59AOA|5|We love this stuff. Tames frizz without leaving your hair to greasy! Now<br />my daughter is hooked on this. Almost time to order more.
B005ICBDTC|2|Half of these clips broke very easily, either because the plastic overlying the metal chipped off or because the clip wouldn't stay shut.  I have only used them on my daughter's baby fine hair.  I thought they would hold well since they have the non-slip grip; however, I find the rubber actually prevents the clips from closing tightly all the way.  I have other clips without the non-slip grip that actually hold better.
B0010SXHVK|5|This is an ancient Perfume, I remember my father buying it in 1995, but luckily Kenzo is still producing it. Because it is one of these great fragrances, one can return back and reuse it again. But do not ever buy from other Sellers, I bought a Gucci Perfume from AAA Merchants and it turned out to be fake, it is smelling just alcohol nothing else...So buy only from amazon...
B00EOZ5AYI|4|Not a lot to say other than it's what I expected. I use it along with essence oils for certain cleaning purposes
B000NN5GQ2|5|Since the grocery stores don't seem to carry this, I checked here for it and glad I did.  This stuff is awesome.
B00AOUCN1K|5|Excelente
B007O7AZBG|5|This brush is absolutely amazing! I used to use a Sonia Kashsuk sponge or hand to apply my foundation but have recently wanted to see what else was out there. I knew I wanted to try a brush instead of spending the 20-some dollars on a beauty blender. Let me tell you I am so glad I did!! This brush is perfect for buffing contouring/concealer and applying foundation. Leaves a really smooth but not 'cakey' texture. It is dense yet still soft. This is a MUST for any makeup collection/kit. I seriously said out loud, \\"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE!!!!???\\" 😍
B001AZ022A|5|I just got this face wash in the mail a few days ago and it has already made my face look clearer, brighter, and it feels smoother. The scent is a little heavy, like men's cologne, but it is not unpleasant. I was sort of hoping it would smell more like the sea. However, I do like it so much that I ordered the toner, moisturizer, and the face scrub. Good product for the money.
B000S8HGIS|5|Fast shipping! Satisfied. Glad I got it here for less then getting at the mall!
B001J6O5Y6|5|This is my favorite brand by a long shot, hope they never stop making it. I would recommend it to any man.
B001LY7GEM|5|EXCELLENT RAZOR,CUTS STUBBLE LIKE A HOT KNIFE CUTS THROUGH BUTTER! GIVES A VERY CLOSE AND SMOOTH SHAVE WITH JUST TWO PASSES.VERY EFFECTIVE, AND I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!
B007Z4RXUO|5|Product is a dream especially on those days I care not to \\"do\\" my makeup which can be new often than not
B000TAE0RK|5|Great clean and smell!!
B001NQIPMU|5|Exactly as depicted.
B000BD97B4|5|I love my Vitapointe.  I've used the for many years and it still does wonders for my hair.  It truly gives your a beautigul sheen,  body and softness.  The Clairol.
B00H7NKNE6|5|I love this product. I do use it for face, lips, etc. A little goes a long way.<br />What I don't use on my face; I wipe on my hair for a nice shine.<br />It does go on oily but don't worry; it will absorb in a few minutes.<br />I will order this again for sure!
B00JO3H5WA|2|Not stretchy and very tight on my head
B000XSJKBE|5|I love painting my nails and have accumulated close to two hundred polishes. However, my place of work is fairly strict about what colors they consider \\"work appropriate\\". Pinks, reds, and pink-n-white French tips are approved colors, so after seeing this polish I decided to purchase it.<br /><br />It is a soft baby pink that would be perfect for those who have the talent in doing their own French tip manicures. The color is delicate and I needed a minimum of two coats, and a maximum of three coats to get an opaque color. However, I did not mind having to put multiple coats on because the formula was really easy to work with. The consistency was perfect, not too thick nor too thin. One coat was a sheer color, but applied evenly, while two made the color opaque. This formula was not streaky, which is something I have experienced with other China Glaze polishes.<br /><br />This really has become a perfect go-to polish for me. Appropriate for work and pairs well with both casual and dressy outfits. I love how feminine and soft it is and how easy it is to work with. A winner in my book!
B0007CXXLY|2|Normally love this product.  It was the transaction that didn't go well.  Expedited shipping took as long as ground - not worth paying the extra.  Product arrived under half full.
B003EODUSI|4|I've never heard of Fash, but my gf wanted it. I purchased this for her, and the shipping was very fast. She hasnt had any complaints about the product. She gets compliments on her eyeshadow all the time. This product is much smaller than it looks btw. Didnt expect too much though.
B001T8OF7G|5|I bought these because I was making a tutu for my toddlers halloween costume and just looped the tulle around the headband.  It worked perfectly for that purpose and now my daughters have tons of elastic no sew tutu's.<br /><br />I also used them as headbands and true to their name- they stayed in place much better than other headbands I have tried!
B00401LIF6|5|works great!  I was having hip replacement surgery- needed long handled brush & lotion applicator and punice stone for surgery leg.  Lulu system had all I needed - longer handle that could be angled if needed, sponge for back and lower leg and foot, non-absorbent lotion applicator and pumice stone for heels in hot summer weather  excellent purchase!
B0015K9BXQ|4|Cuts my hair well (although it makes a big mess!) The slide-out trimmer doesn't work well, but I have other trimmers for that.
B00F54PT16|2|Not what I wanted.<br /><br />Would like to send it back. somehow lost the papers.
B0073P01RC|5|I am one of those people who wears sunscreen all year long.  There is skin cancer (basal cell) on both sides of my family and I want to do everything I can to protect myself.  This product is a rather dark color in the tube but it worked for my very fair skin when I put it on.  (The color doesn't really show once you put it on.  I suspect the tint is designed to counteract the whiteness of the sunscreen ingredients.  You would still need to use foundation or BB cream on top of this if those are products you normally use anyway.)<br /><br />The mineral sunscreens in CoTZ products (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) are my preferred sunscreen ingredients -- especially to be used on my face -- as I've had some allergic or sensitivity reactions from chemical sunscreens.  Perhaps because of the tint, this blends into my skin much better than other mineral sunscreens.  There's no white residue all over my face afterwards.  I also like the smooth, almost powdery feel that this leaves on my face.  It's not greasy or oily at all.  It's very easy to apply and has a smooth texture.<br /><br />My typical routine is to use cleanser, toner, moisturizer, then sunscreen.  I usually follow with a foundation primer and liquid foundation, then a little finishing powder.  (That sounds like a lot.)  This product works well in that routine; I don't get any shine on my face midday.  It also works for lazy weekend days when I decide not to use foundation.  I've used a couple of similar products lately (trying to find the best one for me) and I think this interferes less with my current cream blush than the equivalent Coola tinted SPF product.  For what it's worth, this seems to &#34;get along with&#34; my skin pretty well.  I've experienced no new breakouts or irritation since using this.<br /><br />I'm definitely happy with this product and glad I gave it a chance despite the dark tint.  (I've since ordered this in the lighter tint to see how I'll like that.  The performance of the product is excellent.)is excellent.)
B000A3V2NQ|5|Can't find this product locally anymore, all good things seem to phase out. Leaves hair soft and it protects your hair from heat and not oily like many heat styling products out there. I would recommend giving it a try.
B005C48ZL0|5|Great product for the price!
B00ISEOY20|5|I ordered 2 of these for my wife and they arrived in early October 2014. She uses it once a week.  She loves this and claims it works.
B0085LXOC2|5|girlfriend love and uses this daily so it must be good for her because she can be a bit picky
B000GIOBY2|5|Muy buen producto y cero complicaciones para compras internacionales  Excelente colonia muy buena y el precio tambien    Excellent product
B004H8VPQY|3|used it and not as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. I'm going to order the conditioner and see if that makes a difference
B002NZJ6GO|5|Love this perfume!!! Glad I found it!!
B0043IAUQO|5|I LOVE this product. Obviously I've purchased this from other vendors and love it! I think this seller had the best price on this item. Now my Flower Bomb is contained in an excellent travel atomizer! Thank you!!!
B00DDVAVN4|5|Love this stuff. The Fresh Breasts goes on like a cream, but dries to a powder so it can show on your dark clothes if you're not careful. When this happened to me I just used a clothing sponge designed to remove deodorant marks from dark clothes, worked like a charm. Both products help keep me dry and comfortable, more so than just plain powder, like baby powder. I highly recommend these to anyone.
B00DHMHHCC|5|These La Lavande Soaps smell perfect, whenever I wash my hands with them I just have to smile because of their sweet aroma!
B00KWTYYWE|4|Really nice moisturizer for men.  Absorbs very quickly and doesn't leave a shine.  Some reviewers have commented about the scent. Personally, I can't notice any scent. Have tried about everything on the market over the years and going to stay with this product.
B00OTJ02BK|5|I absolutely love this brush! It's very well made & better than brushes I paid 10x the price if this one. There was a little shedding of bristles but just because I used a comb to back comb & get the hair out but very minimal & I don't suggest anyone do that to their brushes. The first time I used it my hair was noticeably shinier then before. My hair has grown & feels so much thicker that now. That's another plus it doesn't pull out my hair while blow drying like the more expensive brushes I've been using. I need to purchase a larger one. Hopefully I can get the exact one just larger!
B00E4SQ6F2|5|I got it on time. No damage to the product. I'm satisfy.
B0018OVJ0M|5|I absolutely love Gieffeffe. I own body lotion, shower gel and the Eau de Toilette Spray. Like the last poster I have been told many times I smell good but they don't usually ask what it is.  I have used GFF for many years and can't imagine using anything else. It is my smell and it took a good effort to find something I really like. I hope they make it forever!
B00J2APR98|4|I received the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology to try out and loved it! It provided a close shave and did not irritate my skin.  It left it nice and smooth and really liked the FlexBall technology to get around the sides and creases.
B001AN0UTC|3|I have been using bare escentuals mineral veil for years. For some reason when I use this product I recently purchased it makes my skin look ghost white. The texture is the same but instead of creating a transparent finish like it usually does, it creates a opaque white powder layer on my skin. Maybe its the seller I got it from?
B001157V5A|5|Love this soap
B000P41F8W|5|Great Service and item
B007TIM8A6|5|This stuff works. Smells pleasant to me (unscented but smells earthy to me), not super greasy, not sticky like lanolin can be, it just plain works. Oh, and im pretty sure this jar will last me a few months!
B00LHHS0L6|5|Perfect. Arrived quickly and great item
B00FXFBJES|5|Women Perfume Premium Quality Fragrance Oil Roll On- Similar to ED Hardy.... I Love the of roses. But they die to soon. so I found perfume that smells like roses.
B000OROROE|1|I am disappointed after all the good reviews of this. This not a creamy white as I expected, but a goldish shimmer, which definitely does not work for older eyes. If you want a gold shimmer, better than this is Estee Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place ShadowCreme, in #13 Golden Sands. It has a smoother finish, which is another issue with this.
B008XCNH0W|5|Best correcting consealer for me.  Spreads on evenly and lasts all day
B000C1UBV0|1|I'm really disappointed. This perfume is not original. Do not return the product because I'm in another country.<br /><br />Llevo a&ntilde;os usando este perfume y lo que recibi no es jamas la fragancia original. Si pudiera devolverlo lo haria.
B000F4USF8|5|Works perfect!!!  Is very versital.
B00J2AP81U|4|I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch razor from Gillette as part of a campaign.  I have been relatively satisfied with the performance.  The razor does angle well and can get to spots that are otherwise difficult to shave. I would not buy it over any razor however.  i tend to just purchase the cheapest razors I can.
B001TSNA8G|5|I'm in love with this tweezer. I had no idea such amazing tweezers existed and I'm happy I made this purchase.
B00E87B410|5|I love this product more than I love chocolate. And I love chocolate. I use it mainly for my underarms, but I can even endure a DIY bikini wax when I have to. I tried regular wax and it was so painful, bloody and awful - but with this I can only feel the hairs being ripped out, not my flesh.<br /><br />I have bought this for years, one jar is good for a 6 months to a year. I will never, ever go back to shaving. Virtually painless, comes off with water and the strips are reusable.<br /><br />I love, love, love this product.
B007EP9JXI|5|Works as advertised! My hair can range from straight/wavy to frizzy curly and when I use this shampoo I get awesome beach waves. It also smells nice, maybe a hint of coconut?
B006IB8QHE|5|FAST delivery of a reliably fine product. WELL PLEASED !
B007FTQNJ6|5|Super price on this replacement mask!
B0085OD72G|5|Smells good, makes my hair full of body and it lasts for days. I love this shampoo! I'm totally hooked!
B003983HZK|4|I received a free sample of the proglide blade from Gillette, it's a good close shave. It has spendy blade refills but you can find them less expensive than here. The no slip grip on the handle worked decent too, but honestly I don't pay much attention to that. This is a good clean shave if that's what you're looking for.
B006SVCY6I|5|These brushes are amazing. I'm very impressed and pleased with this purchase. It got delivered right on time. I love the black leather case it comes in, the matte black material. You're also getting a lot for the price. It is just awesome. So yeah I highly recommend this to anyone!!!
B00023AIZW|5|I was a little hesitant to purchase this product because the lady at Whole Food's said it would be very rich for my combination skin.  I am in my mid-forties and I am willing to try anything to gain back my youthful skin and I am so glad I did because it make my skin look amazingly dewy and clean.  Just the day before, I purchase the new translucent makeup by Dr. Hauschka and loved it so I wanted to get more products.   With my combination skin, the rose cream somehow regulates the oily areas so my entire faces looks perfectly dewy all over without any oil slicks.  My pores have gotten larger due to the aging process and since I've been using this cream, they are not as pronounced.  That alone is huge.  I cannot say enough good things about this product and cannot wait to go back and get the cleansing system.  Give this a shot as I have spent hundreds of dollars on beauty products and I actually like this better and my skin looks like it did 10 years ago.
B00N6MQ4YA|5|Very nice lipstick. Very pretty color.
B0015VI0L4|5|This is a nice thick cream- very good for dry hands.  My cuticles tend to get very dry & are helped by rubbing this into them a couple times a day.  It makes my hands very soft.
B0047C8OAK|5|Smells divine!! Light scent and my son loves it.
B00CJOC8SW|4|good quality brushes but could still use one size smaller  brush
B00O19V5SC|5|I don't have very good luck with face washes/creams, but based on the good reviews I thought I would give this and their face cream a try.  My skin is very sensitive and always red (I've never been officially diagnosed, but pretty certain I have rosacea), and no face wash/cream I've ever tried has made any difference.  After just a few days of using this face wash/face cream combo only once a day in the morning, I could already see a difference!  I've had such little luck in the past that I started wondering &#34;is it really the ERA Organics stuff, or am I just having a good week?&#34;  Then I went on a vacation for almost a week and forgot to bring it, and my bright red face let me know that it was indeed this wash and cream doing the trick.  For the first time I have finally found something that makes a difference in the redness in my face and it's organic and all natural to boot!  Hallelujah!
B00IMNLD4Y|3|Hubby was the guinea pig for this product.<br /><br />He has owned many electric razors this product doesn't work any better or any worse. It has a great price point. He has dense hair growth. This product doesn't shave as well as manual-blade razor. Also the battery life is not great; it averages about 25 minutes with a full charge.<br /><br />The Detail Trimmer is in a more strategic place then on most shavers.
B00CRGM45O|5|Just buy it.  It's the only tongue brush you'll ever need unless you lose it.  And yea, you definitely need a tongue brush. Then follow up with 3 or 4 drops of ie. oil of wintergreen on your toothbrush.  Briefly brush it over your gums and problem areas and swallow it immediately, which will help sterilize and protect your mouth and leave it minty fresh, while reducing the viral load on the rest of your body.
B007JLKYO0|5|Love it
B003UTEE32|5|I ordered this product from Beauty It Is, and it was delivered promptly and as described.  It came in the proper salon packaging and looks, smells, feels and works just like the one my hair stylist uses, but for nearly half the price.  I have lots of fine hair and a narrower head, and using this at the roots gives me volume and lift without having to undercomb and use a bunch of hair spray and have it looking stiff.  Some people don't like the texture or slightly &#34;sticky&#34; feeling this gives hair, but I think it's a genius product.  My hair is still flexible, and has texture at the roots, and when I want to refresh the volume, I just tousle at the roots with my fingers and the volume and lift is renewed.  Why pay an exorbitant price when you don't need to?  Excellent product and customer service!
B00E4MLBS0|1|This product is disappointing. It isn't very powerful, it does not heat up as it states, it's oddly shaped and the buttons are not user friendly.
B002TSA90C|5|Power scrubbing loofahs for men! On one side, you have a pumice stone like thing to scrub all the grime off with, and on the reverse side you have a loofah to wash it all away with, leaving you power washed like a man, but clean and smooth, like, well,  a man.  Rawr! Boyfriend loves it!
B000EMUBZI|5|I like the 12-power over the 10-power magnification mirror because<br />it makes my whispy little mustache look like the one Tom Selleck has!<br /><br />Great little mirror. Warning: makes little facial flaws look like that river<br />goin' through The Grand Canyon!
B004TSFE28|5|I admit I've never used MAC or more high end brushes so I'm not able to compare, but these brushes are VERY soft and for specifically the shadow and contour brushes I don't think I'll be straying from this brand. Soft, REALLY pick up the eye-shadows, and do their jobs.
B002VJ50PI|5|I's an Oster!
B000HGLNQM|4|The coconut body butter has a great scent and doesn't irritate the skin. It offers decent coverage and is a good moisturizer, but if you want something that is even better, go for the hemp body butter.
B00ABC55UM|5|I hav high arches (meaning faster callouses around the edges of my heels). So, for the last 30 years I have bought every callous &#34;file&#34;, from pricey to the ped egg.  Most did little and a few did a moderately good job. This is the first product that made fast and easy work of the callouses (not perfect, but far better than any other device or file that I have tried). I just hope the motor lasts!
B0015TI5GQ|5|I thought it would be gooey but it's not bad. Love it and the watch.
B000KFX10Q|5|She likes it.
B001B4JOX8|5|My son fell and had a small open wound, basically the skin just split right next to the eyebrow, but not large enough to require stitches. Well, maybe 1 stitch. I had these butterfly Band-aids in my first aid kit and I also had some Nexcare (3m) butterflies. I tried to get the wound to close with the Nexcare butterflies and they didn't work. I think that the problem with the Nexcare was that the space in the middle was not wide enough to allow me to bridge the wound and pull the skin to close. It is hard to compare because the shapes of the two are completely different and also it probably depends on the location of the wound. Nexcare is more like an 8 shape and it will probably work fine on maybe the forehead. Then I tried with the Bandaid butterfly and while it is true that opening and removing it from the protective backing was not easy at all (nothing like regular bandaid, I had to hold the end that was attached to the skin and really pull with the other to remove the protective backing), it did stretch and lay over the wound a lot better and easier than the Nexcare and once in place, it pulled the skin closed, which is what I wanted. So for me, it worked great and I am getting some more just in case.
B001C53IDI|2|I love lemon perfume and was hoping this would be just the thing to carry in my purse for an instant fresh point-of-view.<br />It has a cloying old-lady-perfume smell and the lemon is barely detectable. Don't do it.
B00W35D46C|5|Got the black trim. Solid container. Not as cheap of material as another product I purchased.
B000F4USF8|1|Very upset. Flimsy attachments battery life is terrible. A bad product.
B00HWLY1UA|5|Smells fantastic, leaves my hair soft. ine of Bed Heads best
B002G57WP8|4|I used this product last summer everyday after swimming in a pool, and it really helped to hold protect my hair in general.
B00ODSL90K|5|favorite face mask highly recommend.
B0009ET5LW|5|This is a great lipstick - long lasting, with a minty taste that tingles.  It doesn't dry out your lips, so the color lasts.  Fig might be a little dark for some skin types, but for me it looks very natural, just a little darker than my natural lip color.  Overall, this is a nice alternative to the usual dry oily lipsticks, and I will buy it again in the future.
B0018A32XS|5|excelente
B00O8ODHOA|5|This is a great upgrade in the tooth department. I had a 8 year old basic oral b, I consider switching to the sonicare, but read comparison studies that said this did the same job for 1/2 the price. ( I used saved money to buy a water flosser- another great buy).<br />I love the blue tooth app, I did not want a device on the wall. I find the app helpful and my note 3 has plenty of room for it.<br /><br />This comes with one basic head, all the heads are cheaper than sonicare. I wish I could buy a variety pack instead of a three pack.<br /><br />Between the water flosser and this I am off to a great start in tooth maintenance. I would buy again and will keep upgrading.
B000I5MJ8S|4|It's a little more involved but I'm enjoying my BeautyBlender. I find I use less product and get a better finish. Considering how much I hate using the typical wedge sponges that's saying something. This set (with the cleanser)was only $3 than the set without...so I'd say it was definitely worth it. The cleanser works well and does remove all the product. The scent is mild and pleasant.    I'm happy!
B00B0SPRPE|5|So much better than I ever expected. Definitely will be purchasing this again and again. Every scent is so wonderful and well equipped with great mixtures
B001441QCW|3|It moisturizes well, but the unscented has a bit of a strange smell to it. Fortunately the smell does not linger at all, but when I first apply it, I smell like donut grease for a few minutes (this is the only way I can explain the smell). I will not be repurchasing.
B00G4R48AQ|4|I was going to buy the much more expensive version by Panasonic, but gave this a try.  I don't know if clam of Nano-sized water particles can be substantiated or not (really, if they didn't care to get a proper English translation on the box and have no instructional insert, have they really tested the size of the particles?).  It pretty much seems to be a water boiler with a small hole to prevent splashing. However, it does what I need which is to open pores (and sinuses) with an abundant supply of directed hot steam without bubbling hot water onto me.  It's also very cute.  For the price, not bad.
B008LEQENE|5|Very clean and rich Shea Butter with a beautiful white color. Made several batches of soap and turned out beautifully. Will buy again.
B007SUF9M4|5|Very satisfied ! Smell wonderful.  I apply in the evening, it leaves my skin so moist throughout the night ! Highly recommend for people who has doubt, buy it !
B002RL8IWC|2|Did no help my wrinkles
B004Y9GTAS|1|leaked all over package
B00GA77KYG|5|Exactly what was needed to attend an NFL game.  Met all their requirments.
B007VCFVWC|5|I bought this a bit cheaper on eBay, but as far as I can tell it's the exact same product. It's a pity that Amazon lists the various colors of the product as separate products rather than one product that comes in different colors. This way, reviews end up scattered around the various listings. But I got the white one, so I'll review the white one.<br /><br />So here is the question I'm sure everybody is waiting for: Why on earth would I want to spend this much money on a hair dryer?<br /><br />First of all, I did not spend quite as much as the list price here, since as I mentioned I bought elsewhere for a good discount. But even with a good discount, this hair dryer is expensive. A good consumer grade hair dryer is usually more in the $20-50 range.<br /><br />Well, let's start at the beginning. I hate hairdryers, because they take forever. Sure, I like the idea of drying my hair with a hairdryer. It makes it nice and smooth, and you get to dry it as you are putting in product, rather than haphazardly directing the product in the general direction of still wet hair and hoping that once it all dries up the product will cause the result to look better than it would have without. But at the same time, I'm busy (or, if you prefer, lazy.) Usually, my sloth wins out over my vanity, and I just towel dry my hair and get on with things. Then, one day, when I was a little bored, I decided to actually give some thought to these problems that had been going rumbling about in the furthest recesses of my brain for years. Is there a better way?<br /><br />It soon dawned on me that when you get your hair cut, they often wash it before and dry it afterwards. And they often dry it remarkably quickly. I had always assumed that this was because the hair had already had a chance to air-dry a bit while being cut, but this kind of thing called for a bit more research. How much power do hair dryers actually put out? What kinds of hairdryers do professional hairdressers use? How much powerdo those put out?<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the research turned out to be very simple. There was no need to experiment. All the information was readily available online. As it turns out, the main variables to consider in a hair dryer is how hard it blows, and how hot. More air per minute means faster drying, and so does a higher temperature. The power usage in Watts of a given hair dryer is a decent indicator of how effective a hair dryer will be, but it is not perfect. It turns out to be easier (read: cheaper) to increase the power of a hairdryer by increasing temperature rather than volume, but that is not actually what you want. There is a practical limit to how hot you can make the air coming out of a dryer. If it is too hot, it hurts the scalp. (I don't mean that it causes some cosmetic damage to watch out for. I mean it _hurts_.) Also, the consensus seems to be that too high a temperature with not enough volume of air causes the hair to dry in a way that makes it frizzy. (The details don't really matter to me, but it's explained in several places on the web.) So a good hair dryer has a lot of power, but also, it allocates a good amount of that power to blowing harder and not just heating up the air to a higher temperature.<br /><br />Then there is the ionic business. The amount of pseudoscience being bandied about on that topic is too large to dig through; I suspect that all that's going on is that by putting a slight electrostatic charge of the same sign on every hair, the hairs repel each other a little, leading to a smoother, more even look. But maybe there's more to it. Google around and you will found pages of theories about the endless benefits of ions.<br /><br />Anyway, armed with this background knowledge, the obvious next step is to ask where professionals buy their blow dryers. I soon found out that most brands market themselves pretty much exclusively to professionals or exclusively to retail customers. The professional brands are often European or American, rather than East Asian, in origin, and prices are of course higher. From what I could find, Parlux appeared to be clearly one of the most desirable brands. Everybody writes the same thing about these things: they are solidly built, and they put out a very high volume of very hot air to quickly and smoothly dry hair. Moreover, unlike other pro-oriented brands, Parlux actually has a compact model, which is the one you are looking at now.<br /><br />Based on all that, I decided to go for it. Sure, it's a lot of money, but if I was going to buy a _good_ hair dryer, I was going to buy a _really_ good one, not one that was better than the old one but not quite adequate and that would end up having to be replaced yet _again_ later. This hair dryer is clearly the Cadillac among hair dryers. Or, maybe, given it's size, we should say it's the BMW 3-series: very high quality, but compact.<br /><br />All right, so enough with the suspense. What is it actually like to use?<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about the Parlux is how solidly built it is. The design is elegant and as pretty to behold as a handheld electric motor and heating element are going to get, but once you hold it, it exudes quality. The dryer as a whole is surprisingly heavy, though not so heavy as to be hard to handle for a person of normal strength. The selection switches for setting the temperature and fan speed are clearly of a very high quality, designed to be flipped many times daily for many years in a busy salon setting. The air filter on the back, which comes off for cleaning, has a very tight and precise screw fit.<br /><br />Actually using the dryer, you notice that the maximum temperature is precisely the highest temperature that you can comfortably use, and it is reached virtually immediately when you turn the heat on. The volume of air put out by the fan is enormous. In terms of drying speed, this is not an incremental improvement over the $40 consumer-grade device I usedto have. This is a whole different experience. My (admittedly not very long, and thoroughly towel-dried) hair was dry within a minute or two, and came out very soft and smooth virtually immediately.<br /><br />It is up to you whether you want to spend this sort of money to get a really good blow dryer. When making your decision whether to buy it, I think you can reasonably assume that this is about as good as a blow dryer is going to get. The question is not whether this product is good enough; it is whether that is worth the money, which only you can decide.
B00DIJPH5I|5|I had to take the time for a review. I have the driest, peeling, ridge filled nails I have ever seen. I have taken biotin and other supplements to remedy to no avail. I have searched and tried different oils. Some inexpensive and some very expensive. This was the first one that I was able to see results after one or two applications. The base coat has helped to seal in the oil and provide a more healthy look till they grow out. The base does fill in and bind with the nail. It will not peal off like others. I wear rubber gloves when hands are in water for extra protection. I apply the oil to cuticles and under nail. I use to be self conscious about showing my hands, but now the nail looks much better and is not dry, thin, and sensitive. This is a relatively inexpensive product that REALLY works.
B001BKQ3ZY|5|this eye cream seems to do the job. I've only been using it for about 2 weeks and I've noticed some improvement under my eye area.
B00NB5AZ38|1|I have waited one month  and i inly got one plate! The pictures has more than ten but it only gives u one of those plates! Dont buy or waste your money on this! Its a waste of TIME AND MONEY!
B004BCVFHA|5|This is a very subtle but sexy look on my lips. This lipstick applies nicely and the colors holds well. I would purchase again.
B004OEO0E0|5|This lipstick holder is as advertised----very sturdy, useful and well designed. It can be  put on a counter or stored in a drawer.  I am waiting for Amazon to replenish their stock so I can order two more.  Who has just 24 lipsticks????  I have way more.  Love it!
B002SR1HHS|1|Slight disclaimer, I have been using Bare Minerals for the past 3 years and was looking for a powder that would give better coverage (I am prone to pimples and have a lot of freckles).  One thing this powder is GREAT for is coverage...which is good, because after using this for a few days, my face broke out and has been a train wreck ever since. I just switched back to Bare Minerals and am already seeing an improvement.    Bottom line...don't use it!
B000EGVYMI|5|I got this color in a holiday gift set with two other colors (topaz, and celestial), and I loved it so much, I used it all up. I had to order more, but Laura Mercier no longer sells it. So glad I found it here!
B00GBCPM6I|5|Very sturdy acrylic and clear in color. Fits all sizes of nail polish bottles that my daughter owns.  Received as one piece.  Received timely and packaged well.
B00DG8EZKO|4|Nivea creame always does a great job in winter.
B001MA0QY2|5|Worked as I expected it to.  Loved that you can adjust the heat setting.  Easy to use
B005C48ZG0|1|This is the most terrible quality!  The brush is horrible and I have never had such clumpy tarantula looking eye lashes before until I used this.  I am sorry that I tried something new, will definitely go back to my old brand.
B0014UCK12|5|Marjoram oil works quickly on tired, sore, tight muscles as well as muscle spasms and pain. The Quality and the price are very good.
B004WAASO2|5|My hair is very fine and many of the volumizing sprays weigh it down more than fluff it up!  I really like this spray - not heavy or sticky. Would recommend.
B00070QF20|1|It was horrible it came like if it was used the bottles were all faded . Wish I could get my money back!!
B00DJWNBXY|1|worst sunscreen I've ever used....and yes I have used mineral sunscreen before. This does not stay on at all, doesn't rub in, gets on cloths and ruins them.  Not worth it at all.
B00C7UF0PG|5|Great oil! I use it in the shower and rub in my skin. I also use it to moisturizer arms and legs in dry AZ. I am planning to add essential oils to it, but haven't yet. It's nice and unscented. Love it!
B003BRQ36O|4|While purchasing DE blades I accidentally selected these little gems while building my order, after the blades arrived I discovered what I did, rather than returning them I picked up a Parker shavette to make use of these blades.  Having had some time behind a straight edge in my shaving endeavors, the switch to the shavette was rather simple and I couldn't have been happier with my mistake, A smoothe shaving blade with not a hint of razor burn. I can get 3 solid 3-pass shaves from these up to 5 if I push them before they start tugging on my whiskers.
B00DAGJ3OU|5|easy to store, and perfect for drying brushes. Almost wish it had more brush holders.
B007FMXL52|2|I give it 2 stars because even though the shampoo removes the chlorine smell the conditioner really doesn't do much for your hair after swimming. I've used it before and after and my hair just doesn't feel smooth, it mostly removes the smell.
B00IX9D42G|2|I love the thought, but It doesn't work.
B00D0ELR46|5|Beautiful and well constructed.  Receive many compliments when I wear it.
B00PPIQTWK|3|Great time but is very fragile
B009RNUH4A|5|This is the second order I have placed for more than one can. Usually 2 -6 in one order. I ALWAYS receive 1 can that does not work/spray at all. And yes, I turned the cap to expose the spray hole. The product is not returnable because &#34;regulations&#34; so I am just out the cost for an unusable can AGAIN! Very frustrating and just wrong that I cannot get a replacement. I will attempt to find a store locally to find this product in the future, so 1 can doesn't in the end,  costing me the price for two.
B002QHFG3Q|5|WOW WOW great product.  Works great no issues. Everyone should have one. It heats fast and does an amazing job of straighting hair.
B003BQ6QXK|5|I've used several different fogless shower mirrors (all bought from Bed Bath & Beyond).  Most of these work only for a short period of time and then fog up no matter what I try to do.  Bought this fogless shower mirror based on others' reviews.  It works very nicely and I have no complaints.
B005E2VMZQ|5|Bought these because of the price. Was very happy when they arrived as the quality is the same as the ones I was buying on ebay but the price is much better. I would recommend these to anyone.
B004USSAAK|4|I love the One Sweep eye shadow.  I got a sample as a BzzAgent and it was super easy to use and the colors blended well on the different parts of my eyelid.  You just pick your eye color, swipe the applicator on the colors, and run it across your eye. It's as simple as that.
B001H988KW|5|Great product at a great price.  My wife couldn't find this product in the store but found this great deal on line.  Sorry for the long delay in reviewing this purchase.
B004W03H9U|5|I was turned on to Bentonite in 1999 and have enjoyed its wonders ever since. It clears up almost all skin problems, and many other health issues, cheaply and quickly, so no wonder it's still kind of a secret. No major drug or cosmetic firms will talk about it, unless it's to give it some fancy name and charge a fortune for it. It could and should replace their overpriced junk in a snap.<br /><br />That's why this stuff is good; it's top quality bentonite for just over five clams a pound, and a pound will last you months. Not much profit margin for the multinationals, is there? And no side effects requiring the purchase of more products. Dang, Mother Nature hates money! What's her problem?<br /><br />IMPORTANT TIPS: Don't just mix the powder with water and use right away. MUCH better is to make a magma gel ahead of time. Here's how to do it right: use a glass, clay or plastic container with a tight lid, and fill it with one part clay powder. Then add two parts fresh, filtered water on top. DO NOT MIX. Or shake, etc. Just add water, cover and let sit for a week. It will now be a perfect gel that spreads on your face and body more easily and effectively. That gel will last for years.<br /><br />The reason you can't use metal is that the gel has a magnetic charge that's the key to it sucking up toxins and heavy metals etc from your cells. Using a spoon to touch the gel, etc will kill that charge and stop the magic. Seriously, I've made the mistake and seen the lack of results. NEVER let metal touch the gel and it will stay active for years. Decades, in fact, if you keep adding water when it dries out.<br /><br />Yes, this stuff sucks up all sorts of bad chemicals from not only your skin but your whole body, especially if you drink it. Well, you really eat it, as the gel is more solid than liquid. It can be hard to get down, but once you get used to it and see its effects, you'll enjoy the taste!<br /><br />Bentonite is great for cleaning your teeth and breath as well, so leave some in your mouth and brush or swish it around for a minute. No more halitosis!<br /><br />It also chelates better than anything I've ever used. I've seen it pull serious toxins from people who first spent thousands on unsuccessful chelation therapy. The trick is to make a bentonite bath, but first cover all the metal in the tub with duct tape. The first bento bath I took left the tub filled with black goo. Every bath since has been light grey. Clearly the first one got a ton of crap out. Please scrape the goo out after draining the water through a filter, as it will clog your drains. If you were toxic enough, you could burn your hands on the black goo; some say you should use rubber gloves. It's now full of toxins, so wrap it up well and let the earth in your yard filter it out by hosing it into the ground.<br /><br />Truly, this stuff is one of the great health miracles of them all, but is kept pretty quiet because they can't patent it, and it's so abundant across the planet, and sooo cheap. I used to buy 50 lb bags for 40 clams! Now they don't sell those commercially and it's at least 6-10 a pound, with about a 500% markup. This clay is just over 5/lb, so I recommend it over the more highly packaged stuff.<br /><br />But frankly, I think it's best to try every type of bentonite you can find and see which works best for you. I have both green and white French montmorillonite, clay from various southwest US deposits, etc. Each seems to have its best use. And because a pound of powder can last years, why not experiment?<br /><br />I haven't mentioned one of its greatest uses: it clears up bowel issues and really makes your intestinal flora happy. Kills heartburn in minutes and then you poop like a king for days. No lie, it works, try it.<br /><br />This magic clay can get rid of most of the pills and meds and chemicals many of us use daily, and for pennies...no wonder it's not very well known.<br /><br />For a ton of really in depth facts about bentonite,I've never found a better resource than eytonsearth and then a dot and then org. The eytonsearth guy knows this stuff inside and out, and persuaded me to use it the same way: both inside and out. And boy does it work. Check it out and learn for yourself why bentonite is one of the finest things the planet earth has provided for the health of the human body.<br /><br />Bentonite forever! Literally, because it's been here millions of years and we won't run out of it for millions more.<br /><br />Mother Nature wins yet again.I've never found a better resource than eytonsearth and then a dot and then org.

B003V360NY|4|This is the first shaver I've used. I think it shaves great, my skin is not irritated, unlike as with razor blades, and it shaves smoothly. The only problem is charging the power. The recharger is not convenient to take with me when I'm travelling. However, because the battery works for three weeks, it's not that much of a problem.
B003YCAQDC|2|It was thick and clumpy right from the start. Didn't live up to its claims for me. Would never recommend this product.
B003HN393C|5|Clear Zinc products are great for our family with sensitive skin.  They are non-irritating and block well.  We are sailors & swimmers which puts any sunblock to the test for running/streaking.  These hold up well & don't run into the kids eyes.  Great for hair parts as well..
B00E8LW8GQ|5|LOVE THIS PRODUCT
B001ANOOOE|5|My favorite. I always make sure to buy one before I run out
B0056GDG90|1|This is one of those hair curlers that you have to wrap your hair around the stem rather than having a clip to hold your hair. I don't have enough hands to do what's needed, so I returned this because I simply couldn't wrap my hair around the stem. Instead, I got one of the curlers with the clip. It works great.
B005RTYPAK|5|great product
B000M8AF0A|5|very  useful
B00385WMJ6|5|Original review: Ive had this for about a year and I use it 5-6 times a week.  The pattern has rubbed off a bit around the creases, but I don't handle it much except to put it on and take it off.  It sits comfortably on my big head.    Update: I upped the star rating to 5 stars.  I purchased this cap way back in 2011 and I still use it 4-5 times a week.  I bought it to replace the cheap hotel shower caps that I used to go through about once every month or so.  The elastic is still in great shape and holds my medium length, thin hair securely.  I don't usually get it wet (only because that makes a loud noise when I'm in the shower) and I don't grab the patterned portion (I don't want to get my hands or hair wet in the process of removing it), but instead slip my fingers under the band to take it off.  The pattern is still completely solid except around the creases.  I've not had any experience with black marks, but then I'm not rubbing my hands all over it.  No signs of mold or mildew after 3 years even though it doesn't always dry completely between uses.
B00KP5TS4Y|2|harsh and uncomfortable
B002BA60WO|5|I haven't used foundation in years because it is so oily and heavy and I have a problem with breaking out.  I had been using the mineral powder which still makes me break out but not as much.  I hate the wrinkles under my eyes so I thought I would try this product but was worried it would increase my breaking out.  I've even tried pro-active which didn't help me at all.  I first bought the wrong color and the store wouldn't exchange it because I already used it (should have went to Walmart!) so I contacted Cover Girl and they sent me a coupon to get the correct color.  Great customer service!  The jar only lasts about two months, but immediately I noticed it went on feeling smooth and silky yet not heavy.  It felt like I wasn't wearing any make-up at all.  It evened out my skin and on a scale of 1 to 10 I would say the ageless effect was about a 7 for around my eyes and a 9 everywhere else.  After using it for the first two months I noticed I haven't broke out once!  I don't know what other ingredient they put in this make-up but it stopped my acne.  I have been using it since Christmas 2009 and have not had any acne problems.  My 14 year old daughter started breaking out pretty bad so a few months ago I gave her one of my almost empty jars to see if it would make a difference on her skin, and I couldn't believe it, her acne went down to a complete minimum.  She ran out about two weeks ago and started breaking out again.  I don't know if it is because out skin chemistry is the same or if it would help reduce break-outs for other women and teens, but I can't say enough of the difference it has made for our skin and would say that it is not just for older women with wrinkles!
B0091ENBQG|5|i've used it for years and have had trouble finding it. It &#34;erases&#34; better than any other product I've tried.
B0067F28ZW|5|I love these brushes! Great price and amazing for beginners! The Brissles don't fly away and are very absorbant. Arrived on time and are adorable! Also a great assortment of brushes. Definalty should purchase these brushes!
B002QFGQAK|5|Love it! This was everything I expected it to be and more. It applies smoothly and gives a flawless look. I love it!
B003HD28FW|4|I enjoy the product, I use it twice a week and it leaves me skin feelin smooth clean and refreshed
B002YLEQ2Q|5|love it
B0081U1HV2|3|My lips are extremely dry so when I saw this and read the description on the box I thought why not try it for $6.99 at the local Marshalls.  It tingles a bit like most lip plumpers and I put this on without any lipstick.  It does moisturize nicely but it didn't smooth my lips out completely.  Would not pay more than what I did for it.
B001BLRYMO|1|The rollers are much smaller than they appear.  I hate this product.
B00KA5R3KU|5|Love this makeup mirror!!  Uses batteries or plugs in and gives plenty of light!  (Great for tweezing.).<br />I popped some batteries in it and brought it on a cruise and it worked great!  Only downfall is everyone wants to use it at the same time!  :)
B00C8YCFU4|5|Love this product. Fast and easy to use
B00HV3S1GY|5|I love these. Everything about them. The cut amazing I'm so happy with them.
B004XMW27A|4|I couldn’t control my hair, any hair gel that I used was unable to keep hold of my hair. Even the “extreme hold”  labeled products were no match for my hair. Until I found G2B products, inparticular the glue. Now my hair was under control and hold. Sadly I don’t use this product anymore because my hair is short now. If you need to control your hair then I would recommend this product.
B0091OCAZE|4|Finally!  Something that actually seems to be working!
B001KYUGFO|5|I was so totally pleased with the customer service from Yavonae Skin Care. They responded quickly, no questions asked and completed my request within hours. They could not have served me better.  Thank you Yavonae, I will be purchasing from you again soon.  DJ
B000H7O5M0|5|As a pro barbar these cut nice and close/ Excellent prof=duct by Wahl. Still using in 9/2014
B000C1Z1GU|5|I'm always a fan of this fragrance that is the reason why I keep one at work and one at home.
B0045W9YJC|5|I ordered this product on Aug 30th & got it on Sept 1st in my mail box. Very fast! It is exactly what I was looking for.  Every end is clearly a different size & 5 of the ends are large points which is why I ordered it to begin with & it has 1 end that is teeny which works perfect for nail art.  Perfect for doing flowers on my nails & art.  Highly recommend these 5 over the cheaper $2 5 marbled sticks they have on Amazon.  Great seller!
B00BI0ZR9U|5|Perfect, especially as I had never used it before. Easy.
B006L5BPCU|5|I love St. Ives body lotions and this one is no exception. It has no real scent to it, and the formulation is nice and thick. I use this mainly in the winter because it does a very good job of keeping my skin  hydrated without feeling like I just covered myself in grease. It soaks in quickly and works very well. I highly recommend this body lotion!
B00BFFQ0IA|5|My mother loved it. I have bought this style from this particular brand several times before and was pleased! Looks great , modern and sophisticated.
B004RSQ3X4|2|I don't like the smell - especially for small spaces and you can't put them out like you can the incense sticks
B00J7FY8V6|5|Smells great even unlit, works like a room diffuser. when lit burns evenly and makes the hole house smell great in moments.
B00AB2PHNW|5|Excelent
B002LZ3IJ2|5|Is it weird for a non-metro sexual male type to buy stuff for himself because it smells great? If so I plead guilty. Don't really care if the ladies like it or not, I use it for myself.
B00876T3W0|3|They were smaller than I thought they would be its hard to even see the shape of the bow.
B00ABW36K8|1|terrible
B003ILUQPM|5|I was purchasing Konad Plates but they were getting too expensive for me.  When I discovered Bundle Monster Plates and compared the price with Konad, I decided to try it out.  I was very well pleased with the product and the fast delivery.  Konad product, in my opinion, is a more superior quality compared with Bundle Monster, but Bundle Monster will do just as well and you can't beat the price!
B001CEWDHG|5|This is a great product, first recommended by my dermatologist.  Minimizes wrinkles and gives skin a softer look.  I use it before applying moisturizer.
B0099L5NFI|3|It's OK but not something I would purchase for myself again.
B001E722V8|5|This is perfect room and linen spray from anyone who likes the smell of lavender.  Nothing artificial about the smell, you can even use it as a body spray.
B000GHYSVE|5|very good
B004KFS7UQ|4|Actually picked this up in St Lucia.  Haven't used it as an aftershave, however it is excellent for mosquito bites, bug bites etc.  Works in seconds to stop itching.  Great stuff.
B00064JGBO|5|Love it! Keeps my tongue nice and clean!
B00064JGBO|5|Fast shipping....received as stated
B0017WGHRU|5|My wife absolutely loves this scent.  I've never been a user of Old Spice until watching the commercials with pirates. Girlfriend is a big fan too.
B001G7PMX6|5|I have used this product for many years and it really works for me. I have dry skin and this helps leave it feel moist without leaving the shower or tub with a film on them. I recommend it.
B00005B6ZL|4|I have a heavy beard, but this one is the only one I have found that gets each and every whisker.  Easy and price competitive to buy on Amazon.<br />Assembly a bit difficult, but makes for a great shaver without having to buy a new one.  Please add explicit instructions, with thanks.
B001UM30EA|5|The only body wash that actually smells like Honeysuckle
B00DUW2YJK|1|It does nothing and it doesn't come with adhesives
B004ZZM7SO|4|About a month ago, I recieved a small sample of Flora by Gucci and I instantly fell in love. I have been searching the internet for a good price to buy it for ever since and I was not willing to pay 60-100 dollars for a small bottle. I found Flowers by Touche a couple days ago, and thought, well for 3 dollars, i might as well give it a try. I recieved it in the mail today and I LOVE it. It is a lot stronger than Flora by Gucci, but that's a simple fix, just use less! It smells almost identical to Flora and i would definitely recommend it. As soon as I use up this bottle, I will for sure be buying another one!
B0045A2DPG|5|Nothing will work better!
B003SSTKHU|5|Very quick shipping and another great product from Vivo Per Lei!  This moisturizer doesn't leave an oily residue behind and is great morning and evening!
B007462EP2|5|Works great! Much smaller than expected but still great ! Thanks!
B002JKR0HA|3|Took awhile  to get used to this scent, I like it more, but it is not my fav.  Lathers OK.
B0023ASBSS|3|It works just ok. I was hoping for something thicker and a little more moisturizing. It does the job but I will try another one from this product line next time. The scent is alright but not anything special. I have long hair and need a deeper conditioning. This is better for someone with short hair, I believe.
B009UYDOUK|5|I usually this Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream twice a week alternating with the Red Tomatotox Magic Massage Cream.  They both works really well on my skin.  They made your face clear and smooth for 2-3 days.  The price are very good comparison to more expensive brand from USA.  I definitely recommend to friends and co-workers.  I shall buy this again in the near future.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|really good
B00016XJ4M|5|I've been using this for a couple of weeks and I've seen the difference in my skin<br />after using using a baking soda scrub and daiso Japan charcoal peel off mask twice aweek I use this<br />toner morning and night and it feels refreshing<br />Humphrey's lilac and lavender is just as good
B00A7EB256|3|The product gives shine but it doesn't last on my hair.  I may need a different type of oil for my dry hair.
B003MZA9GK|3|its normal, not great
B008AZDTZK|5|haven't worn these since the sixties. I love these. They are the perfect size and length no need for cutting as they are extra short.  They wear nicely.
B003V11QJO|5|I bought this to protect my tattoo from the sun and I think it's going to do a great job. The stick is easy to apply, feels nice against my skin, and even smells nice. Zinc oxide is the way to go when you want strong uv protection.
B000P3ZDNQ|5|I love Betsey Johnson!! I had no idea what it would smell like, I bought it on a whim and am very happy with the purchase. Price was right and the smell is fantastic. A little sweet and has a bit of a musky scent.
B00BP7JEKO|5|Love this mascara, makes my lashes grow and not look clumpy. Can be layerrd well. Took me a long time to find this
B00C7WG9MM|5|Great price. This was a gift for my mom and she loved it.  Shipped fast too
B009CET0RE|5|This conditioner feels great on my hair, even if I didn't have extensions I'd consider an oil free product. It makes my hair feel so soft and look so healthy, I even wash my hair less frequently.
B00J4JWN2Q|3|Its OK, not overall impressive. I like the touch control but you can't always see it. It fits nice in hand nice grip and automatic shut off is always nice works pretty good on my daughters hair when she wants a curly hair day.
B006VEBR24|5|Great product, will buy again.
B00GALDRXU|5|Vitamin D 3 supplement which is easy to swallow. Highly recommended.
B00BQYYMN0|3|It's okay the quality is very nice its thick the color is perfect a little more vibrant than the picture though. The only thing is its a circle seem and if you try to move the bangs you can see the wig cap. I bought this for Ariel cosplay for my girlfriend. She couldn't style the bangs like Ariel which was disappointing. If you plan on  wearing it flat or using for A Poison  Ivy or any other costume that you just need long hair and not really styled i would recommend getting it. Its really a great deal for the wig you get. The shipping did take a while i wouldn't recommend buying it two weeks before you need it it took about a month to get here so order it early just in case. i bought id october 6 it got her nov 2 so just be prepared to wait.
B0050RIN98|5|Great product !!!
B0009OMU0A|5|I've been using the MB-200 for at least three years now.  My previous one broke after I dropped it.  I've noticed that other reviewers are saying that they had issues with the battery, but I haven't had any.  I used my previous one at least twice a week for three years and I've never had a problem.  For the money, I've never found a better model of trimmers.  I feel that this is an excellent value, which is why I bought an extra one in case they discontinue the model. Great value at Amazon too.
B002WJHLJ0|5|Wonderful scented candle.  And powerful.  It could handle a very large room.  For a smaller room, the candle can be lit (or under a candle light) for a short time, then turned off and the scent will linger quite a while.  The scent is very refreshing.  No heavy floral overtones.  Not offensive at all, even if on for a long time.  This is one of my most favorite candles.
B005GMYRXS|1|It is shimmery, but this color is the sort that you see on all the old ladies not for a young woman. This color's not very flattering though it does glide on smoothly.
B00QLG0BE2|3|This is a very inexpensive wig, so I was expecting it to not be the greatest quality. You get what you pay for with it. There are no straps to lock the wig in place. It basically slips over your head and that is it. If you need the type of wig that is adjustable so it will stay in place this wig is NOT for you. Overall, the cut is nice. My only complaint is that the hair itself is SUPER shiny; much more than what the pics depict, so it looks extremely fake. I am going to see if there are any ways to tone down the shininess so I can use it for a cosplay.
B001OVQSJG|5|I got this because i was having scalp issues and red that Tea Tree Oil helps and it really does. I love how it tingles so you know it is doing something. It also makes my hair smooth and shiny. I am hooked!
B00B1I3SA4|5|A wonderful hand cream! I struggle with super dry hands. This seem to work with less than I would use in another cream. Also, NO CHEMICALS!
B00EL27A4C|5|Great gift!
B009HKB152|1|I picked this up to replace a previous wet to straight flat iron: Remington S7100a 1-inch. I had loved my previous one and wanted something which was similar. First, I have long, wavy, fine hair. I wanted something that did a decent job or straightening without damaging my hair.<br />I purchased this and immediately noticed that the air vents for the steam released from wet hair are right where your hand is supposed to hold. This was especially true if you use the finger grooves at the end of the wand to hold it shut, which I needed to do since the straightener often did not close all the way.<br />I use this primarily for my bangs, however I noticed that the iron plates are exposed even when the flat iron is clamped on your hair. This means that I often burnt my forehead trying to get the part of my bangs closest to my scalp. I never had this issue with my previous wand because the iron plates are protected with a layer of plastic so that they are not exposed when the iron is clamped.<br />I also really appreciated the locking feature of my previous one, which allowed the iron to be locked into the closed position. This made it easier to store and it made sure it was out of the way with the plates unexposed while it was heating up.<br />I think it was worth the money to do the more expensive version because this straightener is definitely what you pay for.
B005Q4RKWQ|5|Love it.
B00BJUOS12|3|I have purchased hair extensions before but I always bought them in the store and they were amazing. But I would honestly say I would probably not buy them online ever again. The weft I received seemed shorter then ones have purchased in the past also they were thin. In order to have a good amount of hair you would have to triple the weft. But I made do with what I got because I opened it up already and I spent a lot on it.
B005OKYGHO|4|Very Simple (easy to wear and easy to apply)! Very beautiful looking! The hair texture was quite right and blended perfectly with the saga remy hair!
B004BCTFVS|5|Will continue to use, Works for me. No clumping or flaking and easy to apply. Great product, would recomend. Thanks!
B003ZBL820|5|Excellent product for the hair types for Women of Color!It is very easy to use and the results are great!
B001MA0QY2|5|GOOD
B00FVRCQ0Y|3|I used this for several months and it actually works and works well. Unfortunately, it stained my clothes terribly and I didn't notice until I'd been using it for several months. I stopped using it because a lot of my tops have been ruined.
B001O4B514|5|Got this for my wife and she loves it. Its very easy to carry around. Smells great too.
B00AXF3LN0|4|These are the only thing I've found which reduce my under eye puffiness
B000VXELII|5|Not much to say, other than this product is a great example of an alum bar.  Just apply to wet skin, post shave, and before any &#34;aftershave&#34; you use.  Closes the pores nicely, with a cooling sting (no pain).  This, however, is not a styptic pencil, so don't expect it to fill that role.
B0039MU376|5|love all the scents!! really helps scent up a room pleasantly. enough to share with friends. i will order again
B00GGHEK5C|1|Not what I had order. I receive a totally different bottle
B00H93NJLS|5|Very happy w Argan Oil.
B000PNXXJW|4|I often get acne under the skin which causes large red bumps that are extremely painful. These, then lead to scars and redness that do not go away. I found this online and gave it a try, and I am currently on my second bottle. The whole first bottle really hurt every time I applied. Because I do use harsh skin products, I thought I would be able to handle it, but please be aware of the intense stinging you will feel.Now that I am on the second bottle, I can keep the treatment on for a few minutes without discomfort.  I am happy with this product as it does make my face smoother and more bright but I am not sure it is helping the acne/red scars. I think it is a great boost to use every once in a while, when skin becomes dull. I usually use it during a time of a breakout to help refresh the whole face.
B000OV3ZDO|5|I can see difference in just 2 weeks thanks. now im as pale as a ghost^^
B004TGWRV6|1|For me this product did not work.  It did smell quite nice although I thought a bit too strong for my taste, but I did not notice any difference whatsoever, not with my husband, or co-workers or even girlfriends that supposedly would become even nicer.  I read a lot of the reviews before risking it, but in the end my own charm and personality can do better than this product accomplishing exactly what it claims to do.  I do not think I will buy it again.
B00A1RIMKC|5|I have this kit and had immediate results the first time I used it.  I woke up with smaller pores, diminished lines, softer and smoother skin.  I now have been using it over a month and yes it gets better everyday.  Lots of compliments on my skin.  Family and friends that know me better asked what I am doing.  I use the cream at night because for me it is too heavy for the day but it works very well (apply after serum).  The serum is the very best; your skin transforms before your eyes.  I hope they never stop making this !
B000C1UEGC|5|Cheap, Arrived well before it was said to and exactly as ordered.<br />Real product, very happy with this purchase.
B00BXKJFCA|4|Does what it's made to do.
B0047F70B6|3|High cost performance, but I use the allergy
B00752ZINU|4|If I ever run out of bobby pins again my husband says that they aren't meant for me to have! They are sturdy and perfect
B0013UAQ00|4|I noticed a difference in the appearance of my scar within the first week of using this product.  It looks a lot better, but it's still a bit too \\"pink\\" for me.  I would like the scar to fade further but it looks as if this is as light as it's going to get.<br /><br />All in all, I was pleased with my purchase.
B00V75IIU6|5|Fast shipping! Love the spray bottles!
B000K5HCM4|5|I have been using this product for years on my highlighted hair.  It softens my hair and makes it easier to detangle, and also temporarily lightens the highlights.  Since it tends to run more to the platinum color than gold, it's also good if you have areas in your hair that are too brassy. The longer you leave it on, the lighter it gets, or you can wash it out immediately if you don't want as much brightness. I can tell a difference when I don't use it; my hair looks darker, duller, and drier.  It's hard to find now, which is why I was pleased to see it on Amazon with this company.  The price is low so that makes it even better.
B00CKGGA8I|5|Wow!  These are gorgeous!  I bought them for my daughter's dance competition.  They are truly beautiful.  Great Great Purchase!
B0013TTSW8|2|This is not like the other Wahl products I have had. The gaurds come right off while cutting your hair. CHEAP
B003ZKG6SW|5|Wonderful.
B00390DN34|5|I always have this wherever I go.. It's like my life saver when my hair looks flat and dull..
B000C1ZFBG|4|Excelente gracias
B000EHNDD0|5|I had my old one for a few years before the button wore out. Great product so i bought it again. The only thing i would improve is the ability to clean inside the unit.
B001F51RBU|5|If I hear one more comment from a dentist or dental hygenist that I need to clean better between my teeth where my permanent retainer sits, I am going to scream!  I have tried everything.  The little floss threaders.  Another kind like this but the floss was fuzzy (like a pipecleaner) and kept getting stuck on the metal.  These work so well!  I use this every single night, and it has yet to fail me.  Even though it seems to be stuck in the tiniest pile in the bottom of the package.  These are not cheap, but you get a better deal from Amazon than the local grocery/drugstore, and besides, these are not the easiest to find in my area.  Last cleaning, the hygenist did not yell at me.  That says a lot.
B006LAFU8U|5|This is a very good product. You don't have to use a lot and it makes my hair soft
B004WPWOS0|1|It clogged my pores so much!
B005620XIQ|5|Received them in good time. Good product.
B002KQ0PL6|5|Ever go to the salon for one of those cute bobs (long or short) and leave with the softest, lightest, bounciest hair imaginable? Then you try to recreate it at home and end up with a flat mess. That was me. I've been through countless round brushes...each time with whatever sales associate telling me I needed to get the one with the straight plastic bristles b/c of my thick hair or (when that failed) to get the one with tourmaline or 24 kt. gold and any number of odd suggestions. I thought maybe it was the hair dryer I was using and went through three different models with all sorts of diffusers and attachments. Finally, out of desperation, I turned to shampoos and styling products. A sticky, dry, oily while later, I pretty much gave up and decided to grow it out and channel my inner flower child. Then one day I got a haircut and the stylist had a brush that was just amazing. Gripped my thick hair without any problem but instead of pulling hard on any tangles (I'm tender-headed), it softly brushed through them like sheets sliding against each other...leaving behind a slightly billowy and very voluminous result. She couldn't remember the company that made her brush or even what size it was, but I examined it carefully and then came on Amazon to track it (or its closest relative) down. Enter the Nexxus Volume Effexx. Built just like her brush (for all I know it IS the same as hers), this brush has the longer and more rigid plastic bristles paired with a shorter boar-like one. The result is that it grips even the thickest of hair and then \\"whips\\" it up a bit to create lovely volume.<br /><br />I used it for the first time yesterday, and I received so many compliments at work. Everyone was asking me what I did differently or if I got a new haircut. Just one run-through with this brush gave me a beautiful soft curl (yes, a bonafide wavy curl) at my bang area. And the rest of my hair just felt so smooth and light, capturing perfectly that salon-like bounce and feel. Also, the brush is very comfortable to use: light-weight and with a super soft handle that gives you both comfort and traction so as to reduce your grip and relieve hand-pain.<br /><br />Can't say enough about this brush and would recommend to everyone. Oh, and I purchased the jumbo btw.the brush is very comfortable to use: light-weight and with a super soft handle that gives you both comfort and traction so as to reduce your grip and relieve hand-pain.<br /><br />Can't say enough about this brush and would recommend to everyone.

B00A9WCSNG|5|Had a bar like this for several years. Didn't know where I got it, so ...looked around, found this...which looked similar. It was the same soap! This is a hard-edged TOUGH bar of soap that gets rid of EVERYTHING! Cuts through grease like magic, has a nice, strong scent, and the grit scrubs off the most stubborn dirt/grime from the garden. Careful...it'll dry out your skin if you over use it, but it's perfect if you're looking to get out soil and/or oils from outdoor work. Doesn't take much to get it going, either. A rub or two gets you enough soap to lather up AND grit off whatever you're trying to manage. HIGHLY recommend this.
B004MOB3KQ|4|My mother got me this for Christmas this year.  In fact my whole family got 2 bottles in this size in different scents.  I received the Basil Lemon and Jasmine scent.  I like that it's 92% natural...no parabens, but it does have alcohol.  I'm not particularly on a completely organic kick but sometimes moisturizers that are loaded down with chemicals will break me out.  My sister and I and Mom all have super dry skin and tend to neglect it in the winter because we never can afford some super nice and luxurious hand cream that will help moisturize.  This does the job!!!  At first the scent can be overwhelming, especially the basil lemon.  But after awhile the scent dissipates and all your left with are incredible soft and supple hands.  I've noticed that the older I get, if I ever scratch or scrape my hands I have a scar long after the initial hurt disappears.  I found out that this was because the moisture and collagen aren't produced properly.  (I cant remember if we just don't produce it or if its leeched out...not sure but it goes away!)  With adding the intense moisture back in the scars are visibly lessened and fade quicker than they used to.<br /><br />I would recommend these lotions anytime...any day!!  The only thing I worry about is if your sensitive to strong scents...then look for the yogurt or guava scented lotions.  I've heard their scents are noticeable less or non existence in the case of the yogurt.  I've read the guava smells like sun tan lotion when applied.
B004ZEQYQG|5|IM IN LOVE WITH THE SCENT! it smells like lemon merengue something very sweet and the lip gloss it self makes my lips look very shiny love this product
B0052EDBIM|5|I like Vichy deodorant, is the best control of all for its purpose, I will always suggest this product to others
B001E6ILDM|3|I have long, dry, very coarse, very wavy, colored and highlighted hair.  This curling iron did about as well as my Conair or my T3 Tourmaline Wet to Dry (see my reviews on those products as well), not as good as my Jilbere.  In fact, I did a head-to-head test with the Conair 2-in-1 and there was no discernable difference between the two, even though the Conair's max temp is 395 degrees.  Like all my previous flat irons, it does occasionally pull a few hairs.    The Wahl took quite a bit of time to heat up to 410 degrees.  It says 90 seconds, but I'd give it 5 minutes or more.  Trying to flat iron my hair before then left it still quite frizzy and wavy.  Even afterwards, it was adequate but I still went over my hair a few times and even then was not fully satisfied with the end result.  Upon careful examination, I found that the plates do not fit tightly together.    About the attachments--I'm not sold.  The comb made it difficult to run the flat iron smoothly through my hair, so I got rid of it.  I was left with one conditioning strip.  There is at least a small section of hair that does not receive any conditioner prior to being subjected to the flat iron.  IMHO, that could be problematic over time.  The conditioner also appears insufficient for any but the most well-conditioned hair with infrequent usage.  I normally slather on the heat protection cream, so I just don't see how an imperceptible surface coating could offer enough protection.  (If you want to know if the conditioner is being applied, look at the hot plates after ironing a section of hair.  You will see faint wet streaks.)  If I was in a hurry and just wanted a quick touch-up, I did feel less concern about not applying product first.  I can't shake the suspicion that I could regret that shortcut in the long run, though.    I switched to a bagless vacuum because I got tired of the expense and hassle of getting bags.  They practically give away printers because the real money is in the print cartridges.  And, while this curling iron seems a bargain at under $50, it would cost well over $100/year in conditioning strips.  That's a year's worth of Biolage fortifying heat styler, even at the ridiculous amounts I go through.    There is no little lip or stand to hold the flat iron in place on the countertop.  I'm always afraid it will spin into something and melt it.  I do like how it's very easy to close, even when heated, as the latch is no where near the heating element.  That offers me some peace of mind with 3 small children running around.  The shut-off feature is also nice.  So it does have some good qualities and is not a bad iron overall, but for the same price, I'd recommend the Jilbere.
B00119TXES|5|This stuff is amazing!  It works better and smells better than any other brand I have tried.  Never switching again.
B0062OF5L2|2|Pretty sure this was a knock off. The fragrance doesn't seem to last for longer than an hour. Not worth the hassle of returning so I consider it a lesson learned.
B00023DIBI|5|This soap is a must for the kitchen.  Has a pleasant herbal smell.  Really cleans and softens the hands.  I keep this on hand at all times!
B000R37OBS|2|Thought this brush was great when first got it but IT'S FALLING APART.  The head plastic is actually cracking and the bristles are falling out.  It's bad enough that toothbrushes go wimpy but to actually break?  Ugh!
B001BKI34I|5|Went to a durable medical supply store and tried this product out and loved it!  I will be using it to transfer myself from a bed to a commode, wheelchair, walker etc.  I have arthritis and can not use a cane, forearm cane, or even a knee walker scooter to get around.  I made a terrible mistake by ordering a knee walker and had to pay a restocking and shipping fee.  The arthritis in my knee was very painful the following day and knew it didn't work for me.  The HEMI is very sturdy and well made.  Its the only product I found that has 3 bars you can grab onto.  Its light weight and folds flat.  Very portable.  Great product!
B009XJ0E46|5|love it
B002WTCK4G|1|If you actually receive the blue DenTek nightguards that are pictured, I would give them a 5 star product rating (I have purchased them before from Walgreens and was quite satisfied).  However, despite ordering from this very link, I received a set of all clear DenTek nightguards, which are bulky and uncomfortable, which deserve only one star.  Buyer beware!
B00BW7GYUU|5|It's an awesome product! One of my friends recommended the product about a month ago and now I can't live without it. Since I have very sensitive oily skin I was concern about using any new product, but this is definitely the one. Now most of my friends are using it...not too expensive and suitable from oily to dry skin. Try it and you'll see the difference.
B002PR2GLM|5|I have fine, type 3 curly hair that is dry. I live in a humid, tropical climate so frizz is always a problem. I have tried 100% argan oil and even after using a ton of it, my hair was still a mess. Silicones are the only things that work in my hair. I used Moroccan Oil and it worked very well but my hairdresser introduced me to this brand and I found it actually worked better in my hair. Although the texture of my hair is fine, I have a very thick head of hair, and therefore need to use a lot of product. At this price I can style my hair without worrying about the cost. I've received a ton of compliments since I started using it. I just apply it when my hair is damp, and braid it for shape and let it air dry and it comes out looking wavy, shiny and full of volume.  And it smells great. I'm a fan.
B0050INH2U|5|Let me just say WOW! This tanning lotion is amazing! I am an advanced tanner and I usually use either spellbound or Australian gold which are pretty expensive especially in the salon. I was at a plateau and couldn't really get any darker so I wanted to try something new without spending a fortune only to be disappointed and then I came across  millenium products.. I saw all the great reviews for their lotions and were so cheap I ended up  choosing black and tan. I went to the tanning bed in the same one I always go in and came out 3 shades darker!! Not orange at all but a deep bronze color! And it smells great too! I am a customer for life now and want to try their other products. If you are hesitant don't be and try it you won't be disappointed!
B00HBSC3JA|5|Great soap! this stuff smells amazing. i also use the amish soap and these both clean the same. this has a manly smell i think fits more men, the amish soap has a more natural smell....just get both and switch them up, that's what i do.<br />The block of this is much larger than i had expected, i think it will last a year.
B001ESE2KG|5|This butter is perfect for my skin. I have Sjogrin's Syndrome and my body is dry. The buter is great for moisture and it doesn't stain my clothing.
B00QL89MRW|5|I received my SANO NATURALS Hyaluronic Acid Serum + yesterday and I am so excited.  I have long been wanting a product that is natural and healthy to activate collagen production without surgery. Firmer, younger textured, brighter skin is POSSIBLE and SAFE after all!  I noticed that Geranium Essential Oil is in the Serum ingredients as well..this is beauty &#34;Mother Nature's Way&#34;!
B00CCYOHPQ|5|I have fine, thin, limp hair. I'm always feeling self conscious about how little volume/density I have to my hair and it makes it a constant challenge to style. The reviews on this product were so good I decided to give it a try and I'm thrilled that I did! I've also even purchased it for my mom and my sister! :)<br /><br />Keep in mind that you'll want to use it mostly on your roots and somewhat sparingly to avoid to much hold. I generously mist it into my damp hair around the roots, comb it through and flip my head over to blow dry and round brush it upside down. I always love how great it looks when I flip my head back up and see all the volume!<br /><br />This product does have a scent, but I find it pleasant and not overpowering. The bottle lasts a long time and I've never had any issues with the sprayer clogging or not working.<br /><br />Overall this is just simply amazing stuff! Nice hold without being too stiff or getting tangled, no sticky residue, flaking or oily feel, and amazingly great volume! I'll be using this as long as its in production!!!!
B008FCWGFC|5|If you want a dramatic effect on your eyes on a budget, these are it. They add a great effect. One of my favorite pairs.
B003HD2LBI|5|Would buy again
B00B1M0XCG|4|not sure if this works
B0018FNUXU|2|I purchased this item because it was linked to the retainer cleaning tabs that I needed to purchase. The vibrating feature is pretty weak. It should not be sold with retainer cleaning tabs.<br />I do not recommend to purchase its a waste of money.
B008OS3FCK|5|I was left with a left leg that was severely and deeply burned at the end of radiation treatments for a sarcoma that was removed from my leg. All my doctor had to offer for treatment was Aquaphor ointment which did nothing for either the<br />healing nor to ease the considerable pain. The wound was so deep it even bled. But I knew what to do as a regular Amazon shopper. I searched Amazon for something to heal radiation burns and found Biafine. I intently read the reviews. I applied the Biafine cream for the first time before bed. Immediately there was a soothing feeling. When I checked my leg the very next morning I was amazed. So much healing had taken place after just the first application! I kept applying the Biafine several times during the day and at bedtime. My leg healed so fast because of the Biafine!  I am so grateful. Thank you manufacturers of Biafine. And thank you Amazon for making it easily available and getting it to me so quickly! My friends and family can hardly believe how quickly and completely Biafine healed my severely burned leg!
B001ADU3FI|3|this was a spur of the moment purchase. waiting for it to arrive was fun and even though the packaging was beat up te product was fine and works well.  all together pretty good for just fun.
B0002RYHTQ|1|Cheap material for the price. Cloth had a funny smell when new
B000EBFJXS|3|pulls hairs,
B003DV6HWS|3|Nice product but wasn't strong enough for me, this product worked for a little but I eventually had to get a prescription from my dentist. This would probably work for someone who doesn't have a severe case of gum disease/infection!
B003WL7OD0|5|For fine hair I love this product
B0037YRN24|3|I have used Chrome deodorant before. This is just a different fragrance. However, I do love the clean, fresh smell that Chrome provides. I also use Chrome Azzaro EDT.
B00027DMSI|5|I have used these for years now and they really work!  I cannot go to sleep until I put my Frownie on!
B000MD65FO|5|Only thing my wife will use.  I hate going to a salon just to get this stuff too.  Fast shipping, no leaks.  Bottle lasts her at least 6 months.  Helps keep her scalp clear and hair shiny.
B001E5E26I|5|I really loved this product. It did what it was supposed to do. It was a little heavy but it did great and lasted a long time.
B00E4PMQAO|5|Quality Trimmers... Higher quality that any others trimmer I have seen. They work very well! Better motor and a light make them east to use.
B0012RST8K|5|It's my favorite in the winter months.  The scent blends so well with sweaters and wool.  It's so cozy and light.
B001AFGLSO|1|I agree with many of the other comments here..this unit is very poorly designed.  I bought this one to replace an old faithful Conair version.  I have a lot of hair but it is very fine and straight.  So I need this type styling tool to add as much volume as I can to my flat life-less hair.  My old one had the on/off switch positioned nicely for the thumb to slide it up to low then high or all the way back down to off - all with one hand.  On this unit you have to hold it in one hand while turning a large dial on the bottom.  The unit is way too thick to be comfortable in your hand.  The air escapes from vent holes before it even gets to the brush, blasting down on your head and hand in one concentrated stream with very hot air.  The adjustable barrel is a joke - yes you can dial it from 1 inch to 1.5 but it doesn't lock in position so it easily collapses.  Wish I had done my homework - I will be looking for a replacement immediately.
B003ZMAT0G|5|love
B00PEF7VZ8|5|Enjoyed all of the samples.  Will probably order more at a later date.
B001F51RBU|5|I have used these for years.  They are great
B0009PVV40|4|It works great
B00CDGR29G|5|I love these plates. The images stamp very nice and clean. They are large enough to cover my whole nail. There is also a large variety of unique designs. I love the cute little case they came in as well. I can easily say that this brand has become my favorite as far as stamping plates go.<br />Other brands that i have purchased had designs that were way too small to use on any of my nails and that were repeated on other plates and even other brands. The images on these other brands stamped very sloppily or not at all.<br />The only complaint I have is that I did not receive plate #45. Instead, I got two #46 plates. I still plan on purchasing the other set of plates very soon.
B00NW5H2DS|3|Pretty but they are small most just fit the pinkie
B00IX89J8K|5|What was expected
B009YSXB3M|5|Perfect fit and good protection from UV rays during gel fill.
B001AO0WCG|5|This product is just as described.  Without making your hair greasy, it makes it very soft and manageable.  My hair has been processed for 20 years and has been damaged a lot.  I can't say it is a hundred percent better.  But, I noticed even on the first day a BIG difference in my hair.  Definitely will continue to use and will buy again.
B002MZ8BK2|3|We have yet to get this product to work correctly. The materials it is made of seems like quality, however we just can't get it to work. We have awesome stamp sets, and I wanted this Konad stamper. It could be the nail polish, but we have tried LOTS of polishes, so I'm assuming it's this. Good luck!
B002QDV2OC|5|This hair was excellent for the price. It does require upkeep and lots of oil sheen to keep it nice. It was easy and fast to braid with. I've received so many compliments on the curl pattern. I'd recommend this product.
B0051BWV28|2|It is very thick cream and feels heavy on your face, but if you like that, it probably works just as well as the Argan oil.
B006HCJXBM|5|Love love love the colors they go on soft and last a long time. They were wealth every penny!<br />I would definitely buy more of these even before I run out
B002D4SDU0|5|I like this because it's light and spreads well. A winning product in my opinion, but I will say for those looking for leave-no-trace product, it's a bit greasy and leave a white cast.
B00D0ANSAG|5|I been wanting to buy a sponge like these but wasn't sure if it was worth it. After looking at the reviews I decided I would give them a try. I really like them, my foundation looks great, it takes a little getting use to since I've been using a brush this whole time but overall I can say it was worth it. It was a good deal because I've seen these sponges for about $24 each.
B00GI0K9ZC|5|My hair went prematurely gray. Using hair color products too often damages hair, but this product helps cover gray roots without damage, and prolongs the time between using permanent color on my hair, minimizing damage. Unfortunately, this color has been discontinued, but there are others still available.
B000C21CRG|5|Great fragrance.
B0006LNOY2|5|awesome, it had really nice coverage for my uneven skin-tone color. I bought NC35 which was just a tid too dark, but overall it was rly good.
B005X2F7KI|5|Super fast shipping. Product came as described.
B00LVPDBA4|5|The item is very nice.I like it very much!
B00IQN770Y|5|Blood pressure is a problem each person goes through their life time. Its always good to keep your blood pressure checked every few days. But who has time to go to the doctor. This is where the wrist blood pressure monitor comes in very handy. It was so easy to set this device up and even easier to use. The display is nice and the text is large enough for people with less vision to also read and understand. All it takes is wrapping the device on your wrist and keep it on the same level as your chest for correct reading. A very good feature in this is that it stores your previous reading and so you can monitor your pressure. It also comes with a carrying case to prevent damage to the monitor when carrying it with you. I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest unbiased review.
B0082ZD63S|5|Non-greasy, easily-absorbed emu oil... I add other skin products to it in order to get them to absorb deeper. Recommend this product.
B00Q1BNG6C|3|For the price, this is a good pedicure file. It does an adequate job and is much better than filing by hand. However, I think the next time I buy one, I'll go with a slightly more expensive for greater strength.
B00GXBEV0A|4|I liked this product, the only thing i didnt enjoy was the smell..
B00N14I4Y6|2|I've bitten my nails off and on since being a toddler.  Now in my older adult years I can go a very long time without biting but if I start it's very hard to stop again.  I looked all over for a product like this and couldn't find one so I ordered it.  I like that it goes on clearly but it isn't bitter enough.  It says you don't have to apply daily but I don't think it lasts that long. I don't really taste it until I've already bitten the nail off!  I really miss the Hard as Nails nail biting polish.  That always worked best for me.
B000JL1P4A|5|Smelled fantastic. My fiancé loved it.
B00A6H2DD4|5|I bought this tools for my sons, and they seem to be happy with it...it does what it should and is easy to keep clean with rubbing alcohol.
B004BCX8B6|4|Works good on keeping lashes looking thick without makeup. I use this every day and my lashes look great.  Just a little pricey.
B00AQ2HEOW|5|Originally tried out this nail polish when I got a mani/pedi at a salon. I really liked how long it lasted without chipping. Lasted almost a week probably because it's so thick from the texture of it. The mini pack is nice because you can try all four colors before investing in a larger bottle of your favorite color.
B00A3LVMMQ|4|Works exactly as it should. Weighted on the bottom so it won't fall over and holds both my brush and razor.
B001GQ3GF8|1|The product don´t go on, I just use it once, bat product at all.<br /><br />Don´t buy it, really don´t buy this product.
B001B2S2PG|5|Love it !
B00943D1JQ|5|It's a 10 products are the best around!!!My hair is shiny, manageable. has never been in better shape.I can not say enough good things about it.
B002UFBSHM|1|The pencil is not creamy and does not glide on easily.  It pulls the skin.  Very difficult to apply and hard to see the glitter at all.  Disappointing, but not surprising at the low cost.  Just can't find a gold glitter eye pencil that really sparkles and is high-end and applies easily.
B00A8LQM80|5|I really like these New York color eye kits and have been collecting them whenever I see one in a new pallet.  I tend to use the white cream (illuminator) as my primary and to use the prime as a concealer is it's very pigmented and blends well into even bare skin.  This particular pallet is a limited edition and not available anymore (it was from the summer).  So I was really happy when I was able to find it here on Amazon, as I was only able to pick up its companion pallet at Rite Aid.
B00NN07IMW|3|Not too terribly impressed - main thing that sticks out is that the brush is not as firm as Sonicare brushes....its like when you are trying to clean a stain out of the carpet and you are using your finger instead of an actual brush. Plus they still rattle like the sonicare brushes do, which I throw in as a design fault by Sonicare....since the brushes don't mount firmly and without rattling around
B00EYUZLIS|5|Cant wait to try it!  Love my Konjac Sponges!
B000FBUQMG|1|This product doesn't work.  The bottle leaks and it is over priced. <br /> <br />Save your money.
B000SZMGL8|5|Awesome product
B0088P2RVE|5|it's amazing I love it I recommend everyone to try it, not expensive & really soft on the hair !
B0026BC9Z0|5|I've been using this for a few weeks now, and I have sensitive eyes. True, it smudges, but only if I rub my eyes, and not as bad as some brands. I didn't notice that the consistency was strange, but I have been using other mineral and natural mascaras for awhile, so that might be why. This hasn't irritated my eyes, but if you have sensitive eyes, any product can do it, even natural ones; there are some eye drops I can't use. I'm not sure if Amazon does returns on beauty products, but I would recommend making sure they do or buying first from a store that does.<br />This smudges and clumps a lot less than the last natural mascara I bought which was $18.<br />I think this gives a great look, but I also have naturally long lashes and I like them to be well separated. I have only had a couple of clumps I've had to pull off, and it seems to get dry enough pretty quick. No problems with it ending up in my eyeshadow, or with things sticking to my lashes.<br />One coat looks nice and natural, two or three is good for a fuller look.
B008X365AU|3|It arrived on time.<br />It really doesn't take my pain away.<br />Hopefully it will work for others
B009A8B7VE|5|TRULY LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR REAL!
B009YLQR4Y|4|So, I got these strips to try on myself, and I tried them on my fianc&eacute; to see if they worked on him first!  Ha, it was funny and awesome at the same time.  You just rub the strip in your hand for about 30 seconds, peel them apart, apply it to the skin, rub it in the direction of the hair, then pull.  His hair was gone!  I tried it on myself yesterday and they worked great (used them on my arm pits).  Of course it hurts, but that's just how waxing is.  It only missed a couple of stubborn hairs that were growing in a weird direction.  These strips are great!
B001TK4LM8|5|This is awesome as a base for bright eyeshadows. Had to depot it to get the product out. Just search YouTube for a &#34;jumbo pencil depot&#34; tutorial.
B004R7QKHO|5|These are so great hair clamps. They were very hard to find at first. They really hold your hair in place.
B00OHXB000|5|This wig looks great!  I'm  pleasantly surprised  at how good it is for the money.
B00A0J0A8S|4|My skin doesnt really feel hydrated after each use but it tends to make it feel tight. But I do think this product is worth it. I use it every time before I head off to class.
B00523FW76|2|Hair drying function is good, but the handle of this machine vibrates annoyingly and unpleasantly in the holding hand during use,
B0091JN2B0|5|I am a Connective tissue massage therapists  and I also like to make body products, this product is pure, and great quality, since it is raw there may be shell pieces and debrie but thats is ok with me the more something is processed the less of its natural healing components remain in the product, I rather filter my own shea butter underneath the boiling point and know that I have a high quality product then to trust someone else to do it. This is 100% raw shea butter
B004ODBFC6|2|Cleans like you'd expect.  No exfoliating beads or anything, just simple liquid (moisturizing) soap... but has a scent like old lady perfume.
B00008MOQP|5|The only mascara I will use.  It's always been the best and I think it always will be.  It stays on and doesn't flake under my eyes. I don't find it irritating like I have with many others...
B000FP7M7E|2|While the charger I received serves its purpose, recharge my razor, it's not the item pictured. I thought I was buying the original charger.Could have bought the same generic charger for half the price.
B00EL8RLL8|5|Great product for a great price. My wife and I looked at 5 brick and mortar stores, 2 consignment shops, and 3 online stores before she finally &#34;settled&#34; for this. I'm happy to say that it is far beyond either of our expectations. She loves it and uses it everyday.
B003VR26UQ|3|While Naturtint is available at Whole Foods, I wasn't able to find this particular shade so I ordered it off of Amazon. As far as hair dye goes its like the others. Easy to apply, not messy, and had a comparable odor. It didn't smell like chemicals but it did remind me of my compost bin. Coverage was good. I found it to be mostly black. I don't see any blue. Could be because I used it on dark brown hair but I don't see even a hint of blue.
B006MMOZC4|1|I have used other brands of squalane oil. This one, I am distressed to say, smells like gasoline. It also has a very thin, slightly gritty texture. Not like any other I have used.
B00M92G53S|3|I like it!! But it was not the one I oder(I order the animal printing and got the black) but it works great.
B003VPNG3E|1|I won't be able to wear this. All 5 of them are the same horrible colour. I will probably wear it at bedtime to get something out of it!
B000KOLX7U|4|I've been using this product for about a month. It moisturizes well, makes my skin smooth. I like what I got. It works well under makeup.
B003FJ6ZS4|5|I purchased these flip flops for a health fair in which we were doing free foot assessments, and shoe fittings for diabetic patients. These little flip flops came in quite handy when going from one station to another.  They were easy to put on and take off. Once they were finished with them they could be thrown away. No worries about getting someone else's foot fungus!
B0009RFB76|3|This was not for me and my skin. I am starting to notice that ROC brand products does not work for me well. It tends to make me break out if it is for the face or make me red. And I don't have sensitive skin either. I am 31 with fair skin and I am indian. Hope that helps.
B000JPMHWK|4|These work great as a starter blade.  I used them after purchasing the long handled merkur safety razor.  I am eager to try the fearther blades after this pack runs out.  I have a thick beard and once I get the full technique down I think it will be time to move on.  Still great blades, but I have a thick jungle of a beard, so any pull slows me down and stops my movement.
B000225ZNS|5|I love Karma. It's one of my favorite scents. I smell more orange and gardenia than I do patchouli, though. It's a very sweet, vibrant scent, without being too sweet and candy-like. I have had no problems with it being gritty or anything like that. I use a powder puff I bought for it, so there have been no problems applying it. I just love this stuff, and it goes further for the money than the soap does, too.
B00IW3HKXC|5|I buy if for a friend and she loves its
B00OP22IWW|5|pretty color and came in quickly!
B00PFEFE3O|4|Love this cream. It isn't heavy and I have seen a result after a week. Smoother skin, general healthly looking
B002UUT392|1|This cleanser makes me break out really bad plus leaves my skin really dry. Do not like this product at all.
B008DCP8I6|3|I bought both this and the Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curling Wand to see which was better.  The truth is they are both OK but neither is great.  It seems like they would be more effective if the heating aspect could be combined with the traditional crimping curler but apparently there must be some engineering issue that prevents anyone from designing such a tool.  I've found it to be most effective if I first use the traditional crimping curler then use one of the heated curlers and then follow up with the traditional curler again.
B00743VJ4W|5|Tried for the first time and it really dies leave your hair extremely clean!!!
B007S64A0A|5|Thank you for the savings!
B00HHGPKZK|5|I am so pleased with this product. It actually works and I'm grateful that I can be pregnant with clear skin and not have to use harsh chemicals to do so!
B001KOTQIM|5|Excellen
B008U8N26I|1|It did nothing. A waste of money. 1star mandatory, but does not deserve.
B00GYN9A08|5|very nice clay..premium quality
B0023UOAME|4|I like it but its hard to use because its a liquid.
B0069SQVK0|5|I love this oil. I use it in both my diffusers and it has drastically reduced the number to colds and flues my family has had this year. And it makes your home smell fresh and clean :)
B007ZKATV8|3|it hurts so much when i take it off, and it didn't clean that well as other comments said
B000WUD83E|5|This is my all time favorite soap. I've also used Dr. Woods Peppermint (which is more mild than Dr. Bronner's). I love the smell of the soap. I use it for everything: cleaning, body wash, face wash, an ingredient in home made shampoo, dish soap, hand soap, dog shampoo. It's really mild, doesn't dry out the skin (I never need lotion anymore), and has smoothed out my complexion. I make it last extra long by filling 1/4 or less (to your preference) of an old foam pump bottle with this soap and the rest with water. It foams the soap really nicely and extends the life of the bottle a long way. I highly recommend it.
B00KHEYQB8|5|I had been having trouble finding this in the stores. It feels so good on my face and it really seems to show results. The seller got it to me even faster than i expected. I will order again
B004RBZ9UO|5|Apparently, I've had dehydrated skin for quite some time (acne combined with dry, flaky patches and a tight feeling after just splashing with water) but just didn't know. This stuff has totally helped me re-hydrate my skin! My acne has gotten much better and the dry patches are totally gone. Another great perk I've noticed is that smaller pimples will disappear overnight. There one day and gone the next. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, too! Totally glad to have an organic miracle product. :)
B002VWK8HK|5|I initially fell in love with this product before it was discontinued and started as a deodorant. I'm absolutely in love with the smell and I'm happy that I can still purchase this.
B003WR3QSG|5|I picked this brush up when I recently made the conversion from electric to a safety razor. I agree with the other posts that it did feel a bit prickly at first, but now is butter smooth. I soak the brush in hot water in my bowl for about 2 minutes while I brush my hair, etc. I've noticed that this will hold a LOT of water, so I have to be careful to get enough water out so I don't have a thin lather. Initially there were several hairs that came out, which I expected. Now that I have used it 5 or 6 times, I think only one hair came out today. I can't speak to the life of it yet, but I will amend my post if it seems like it is deteriorating prematurely.<br /><br />I also did not notice any smell, but I started with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving cream. Smells like grandpa when I was a kid, and I dig that smell. The brush took on the smell immediately, so that was nice.
B000H88QOM|5|It really makes your hair very smooth & shiny when used with a blow dryer & round brush. It doesn't weight your hair down.
B000C00VBG|5|This scrub by Korres is the very best that I have ever encountered and beats the 50.00 a jar scrub by a landslide.  It has fine granules and a fresh scent with no oil film or greasy after affects.  The ex foliating effects are incredible. Absolutely the very best!!!
B001FDKGIW|4|Head to toe. Light weight & powerful
B004YWRYUY|3|Way to go, L'Oreal.  This face cream (says it is a sunscreen on the jar itself, not a cream for anything like age spots or wrinkles)  BURNS MY EYES.  This cream burns my eyes.  Terrific.  What face cream might not get in the eyes.  Way to go L'Oreal.
B00O2MJPXA|3|Nice but bigger than they were described !
B00Q5XEN4U|5|This is my second jar!  I have been using it at night and wash it off in the morning. My skin has been really smooth and no irritation whatsoever.  I have very sensitive skin ( grew up with eczema), hence I am very careful choosing any skin product.  I check all the ingredients being used, and I feel safe to use it for my teenager.  It has cooling effect and really feel great to apply after getting tons of sun during summer.  I am going to need one more for the summer.  I would buy it again.
B0037ZHFRQ|5|I'm really not sure what the other reviewer had to complain about. I'm also really not sure if that reviewer used both full bottles before trying to complain.<br /><br />I am a black woman, mid-30's with oily/acne prone skin. I do not breakout severely, but any time I break out it leaves a hyper-pigmentation mark. This happens whether I mess with it or not.<br /><br />I had a horrible breakout during the summer of 2011 that left me in tears. I was crying not because I had broken out but because I knew I would have to deal with the dark marks for months after the acne had healed. I was desperate to stop the breakout and return the even tone to my skin. That's when I discovered Jolie MD.<br /><br />I researched this product on several beauty blogs and their own website before making a decision.I also took time to look up the ingredients and understand what each one of them did. I was careful to make sure they didn't have any harmful ingredients (especially Hydroquinone).<br /><br />On their web site they had many positive reviews but they said to not expect results until at least six weeks. I knew from my own knowledge that was a reasonable expectation.<br /><br />I saw a changes in my complexion WITHIN 3 DAYS.<br /><br />Friends and customers (I work in retail)started asking me what I used on my skin. I had to tell them in secret because we didn't sell it in the store I work in.<br /><br />I have since finished my 2nd kit and I'm about to order my 3rd. I had been procrastinating because of the price, but my skin is starting to return to it's former \\"non-glory\\". I know better next time not to let my shipment lapse. And although the price is a little expensive for my budget, I have cut down the number of products I had from 5+ to only 3. My kit also lasts about 3 months. I don't even have to use it everyday.<br /><br />Don't listen to nay-sayers before doing your own research. You just might find your answer to better looking skin.
B00CQZVI76|5|very nice product
B00B868SK4|4|Some really nice designs.  Not all of these plates have nice patterns, but most of the designs are nice and new.
B0032PSU9S|2|Pictures misleading.  Ordered this set cause I wanted the batman sign a and power Rangers that were in the picture. Very disappointed.
B000C1VW6I|5|Just a nice, pleasant scent!  I first smelled it on a resident at a care facility -- she smelled so 'fresh'!
B00AW691IY|5|I use this every day under my eye moisturizer. Love this product!!
B00E4PMQAO|5|Works great. The little light seems to be a gimmick more than anything. I don't see how it much helps. But that does not matter. The trimmer does what it's supposed to do and it does it very well.  And it's a cinch to clean. The head looks almost identical to a Panasonic trimmer I bought many years ago. I almost bought another Panasonic, a newer version, instead of this one, but reviews of the newer version of the Panasonic were iffy. People said it was not as good as the older version. So I came here instead, and bought this, and I'm glad I did. Highly recommended.
B006E3STSM|1|I used this serum every day, twice a day, for about a month (or however long it was until the tube was empty).  While it was non-greasy, absorbed quickly, and was fine under make-up - I did not see or feel any improvements on my 30-something skin.  Not recommended.
B002SQZCCA|5|The set is as promised. A great additional feature of the seller was pre-wrapping the gift set. I appreciated this as it was a Christmas gift.
B000E7YK5K|5|It's rad
B0012BNVE8|4|I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR 4 MONTHS AND I CAN SEE THE GROWTH.  SLOWLY BUT SURELY.  I WILL BUY MORE AND WOULD RECOMMEND PRODUCT TO FRIENDS.
B003WR3QSG|3|First of all, if you don't have a shaving brush, get one right now! Otherwise you are wasting you money on good shaving creams (get a good shaving cream too if you aren't using one!) and not getting nearly as good of a shave as you could be.<br /><br />This brush is ok. Ok backbone, no smell, but pretty scratchy for my skin. Looking back, I wish that I had gone to WhippedDog and purchased a silvertip badger hair brush for $26 from the beginning and not wasted my money on this brush - just my opinion.
B00BM1V2U8|5|Excellent
B009AAW1J4|5|Smell like James Bond himself, or at leas what they want you to think. In all seriousness, I have tried many colognes and this one is always my favorite. My wife loves it.
B0096AWT72|2|It's &#34;just ok&#34; because it's not as strong as I expected and needed. You have to apply it over & over & over<br />to begin to see any results but may be strong enough for some people.
B00HAT8EKW|3|didnt work for my wife and mom. they both tried it and it dried their hair more
B000K7JLGM|2|bought it. didn't use it. wanted a silver one. picture looks silver. returned it. will get exactly what i want instead.
B00CP4H3T0|5|My older Philips shaver needed new cutters, however this was on sale and cost me $10 more than a new set of cutters.  Shaves well but then again there are times when I get out the cream and blade.  Let's face it, shaving (manual or electric) is a personal thing, so give it a try if you use electric razor.
B005BREB6Q|5|This cream is a classic for a reason. It works great, makes your skin look healthier. The original formula is getting hard to find...
B005CT9MQW|5|works wonderfully to get rid of the flaky dermatitis on the scalp...also it takes away the dirty odor from oils on the scalp
B00A8WQKAO|5|colors are beautiful!!!
B001CS8BJ6|5|I bought this shaver a couple of years ago to use as a daily razor.  It was really inexpensive and worked so well I decided to buy a second one for a spare.  It's a great bargain.
B000URWZB0|5|I have tried everything for my feet, and nothing worked.  A friend turned me onto these and they really work!  They last much longer than the package says.  When I first got them I used one 2-3 times a week.  Now I use mine once a week just to keep them up.  I have given them to several friends who are now hooked on them as well.
B005JRGJ5O|5|I am very happy with this product.  It has such a fresh and appealing scent and I would definitely recommend it.
B003FVDNO6|5|The spin pin is amazing!  I have shoulder length curly hair (somewhere between 2b and 3a) and the Spin Pin is great for creating quick messy buns.  I love the messy bun I have been a huge fan of it since I discovered it a long time ago, and the Spin Pin allows you to make the messy buy without getting your hair tangled, using 10 million bobby pins, or using a scrunchie that flattens your hair and leaves a dent.  It does not get tangled in your hair.  You twist it in and twist it out (just don't cross the 2 pins - I imagine that would get it tangled in your hair).  I definitely recommend this product.  You only need 2 to create a hairstyle, but I might even buy a backup set, just in case.
B003OKTJW8|5|I lived in the Caribbean for 16months (I'm still see-through white) and this helped protect my skin while I was there. It would help heal small burns overnight and if I remembered to put this on immediately after getting out of the sun, I wouldn't burn at all.  Highly recommend as I have skin allergies that prevent me from using other aloes but this had no negative side effects that I could see.  I also used on regular stove burns and chafing as well.  Helped tremendously.  Also, just a few drips (stuff is VERY runny when warm) goes a very long way.  I lasted the whole 16months on just 3 tubes of this stuff for my daughter and me (using at least once a week, if not everyday).
B00P8CQK90|5|Very niece and thank for the download on a book using coconut. Feels nice. A must have. Arrived sooner than excepted thank you.
B001DU718U|5|Delivered as promised and a great price!
B00062O4OK|5|This cologne is wonderful.  Spicy, subtle, but lasts all day.  I've received compliments while wearing it hundreds of times over the years.
B004VMGU98|5|I get a foot sugar scrub from my regular masseuse but like to use this in between visits.  It also works wonderful on elbows.
B0015YULAO|5|I absolutely love this scent! Since I have been wearing it, more and more people ask me what I am wearing.  I normally don't get asked that question with regular fragrances.  I have placed another order for more.
B00OYVZ6UA|5|it good on hair
B00PG50VGW|5|Good service  and will order again.
B002S8Z4S0|1|was suppose to give a glow, looked like a clown.
B00VV3UV2W|5|[[ASIN:B00VV3UV2W Dead Sea Mineral Hand Cream by LeliaSea Smooth and Non-Sticky Hand Lotion &#x2022; Instantly Heal Dry, Cracked Hands &#x2022; Relief for Eczema and Psoriasis]]<br /> It's the first time I have bought and like it very much. Not greasy, a small amount goes a long way and has a nice fresh sent. I'll definitely purchase it again.
B010U3ME7S|5|Works like a charm. No complaints here!
B00BKFI9I4|5|I was skeptical about the benefits of charcoal soap for it's deep cleansing properties and skin improvement but from the very first use I was convinced.  My facial pores are cleaner and now smaller and my all-over skin is so much smoother.  I now ONLY want to use charcoal soap and the price (which I thought was too much in the beginning) is a bargain compared to what a single bar of Biore charcoal soap is priced.  I am buying this from now on.
B00G3HM9ZI|5|This is great!  It scrapes dead skin right off, but is soft enough that it doesn't hurt and doesn't leave irritation behind when you really go at it.  On a large callus, it takes a while but will still get it.<br /><br />Love that it's flexible too...will conform to wherever on your foot you need it to go.<br /><br />Easy to wash - just used dishsoap and water.  Seemed to do the trick very well...no funkiness left behind.
B0037MMES4|4|I purchased this product a couple of years ago and have been very pleased.  Unlike the previous consumer, I did not have any problem with the brushes.  However, when I purchased the item both the packaging and air brush indicated it was Revlon by Helen of Troy.  I have had excellent service from anything endorsed by Helen of Troy and of course Revlon is a solid product.  However, I have not been as fortunate with any purchases (and I have made a variety of them) endorced by Vidal Sasoon. (the products don't last) Sorry to say I wont be purchasing this item.
B003YJ9YBU|5|I have used Jan marini cleanser for almost 6 years. I constantly have people guessing me at 30. Is very flattering. I'm 40! It's my little secret! This product is beyond all others. I recommend it to everyone who asks about my skin care. I do use a firming moisturiser from another company. But I've tried other glycolic cleansers from others like Mario Badesku etc. And I always come back to Jan. Love the prices from this vendor, fast shipping, my go to when I need more!
B00YYURAJ6|5|This is a great toner. Honestly, I have often skipped toner in favor of just washing and applying moisturizer. My current routine involved a blackhead clearing scrub and Argan oil to finish. With the addition of this toner, I saw a very noticeable change in my skin within a few hours. It seems to have brightened as well as becoming even more soft. I use this on my acne prone face, neck and chest.<br /><br />This is a very refreshing toner that absorbs quickly. It is of superior quality. I find the results superior to that of rose water or witch hazel. It came in a plastic bag which would have been awesome had it leaked, but it didnt! Good packaging.<br /><br />I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.
B0009EILAS|4|I have very dry skin and sometimes it gets itchy, this product is a natural way to help dryness as well as itchy skin.
B008W0CSLE|4|i have had beautiful lipsticks and love this color. But i i dont know why i still found out tiny hole there. But it's enough good to me.
B000YC5AWW|5|This product is amazing. I love that it comes in 32oz size and with a pump in the lid for easy use. It leaves my skin soft and smells great
B00B8VU94W|5|My wife has about 50 different Perfumes and Parfums and when she smelled this one, she was delighted. We don't have a Macy's near by. They had advertised it. I went on Amazon and looked it up. The price was slightly lower than the store, but it was available. I received it with 3 days of ordering and it shipped from CA.<br /><br />This has been one of my better experiences with Amazon. Great product and the seller provided great service. Happy wife!
B00OU5JPPM|5|Lids are a cheap plastic, but otherwise very nice looking storage jars.
B0080MGH5M|4|It was an okay BB cream. It covers pretty well and gives a sense of elasticity. But it doesn't stay on all day and makes my face a little oily than normal.
B000ETVRP4|5|I Love, Love, Love this shade of eye shadow!  I've worn it at least 6 or 7 years now!  It has a good payoff! And is even prettier when wetting your brush!  Lasts all day!  I hate it is so hard to find.  *bay had 1 being sold for $10.00 ((what?!?)).  Glad I was able to get it here a lot cheaper!  I have Mac, Estee Lauder, Bare Essentials etc. even WnW. But I continue to come back to this Prestige Golden Retriever (Orangey Golden Antique Color Bronze) when I really want my Medium Brown Eyes to pop & make a Spectacular Statement!!  Thank You!
B002T3V294|5|Great product for the price! I bought for my daughter for Christmas and she approved! That says a lot!  I liked that it told what each brush was used for.
B004INUWX0|5|Love it. Does the job quickly.
B001UHN0LS|5|the only dryer I will buy
B004H5GD6E|5|My grandma used this on us kiddos when we were little ones growing up in the 80's.  Every little scratch, rash or scrape would get a little bit of this along with some good old fashioned TLC and we were better because of it.<br /><br />I began using this on my children after discovering it's still being made in Germany!  Opening the metal tin, peeling off the protective paper and smelling the scent was so therapeutic.  Brought back fond memories of my childhood!<br /><br />The stuff still works just as well as it did 30+ years ago!  And it's fun to hear our toddler says that she would like the \\"nah-ten\\" cream when she wants it!
B001FJV20C|1|this item was the worst I,ve received from amazon the chain  was missing parts I  threw it in the trash. cheap price and cheaply made.. it was a rip off the chain had only one side to hold glasses.
B00515JT6A|4|I have super thick and naturally dry kinky hair. Not putting it down but being honest. Before this product I'd accepted that I just had dry/crunchy hair. That's so not the case. It works differently for different textures of hair. Personally I go section by section squeezing some in my palm, mixing with EVOO, and combing thru. If I'm doing a twist out then I also seal my ends with Shea butter. Magic. No additional moisture needed for about two days (that's a looonnggg time for this hair). I'm even confident enough to lay on my hubbys collarbone without fear of scratching his neck up lol<br />only dislike is that it contains mineral oil but heck after about a $100 worth and bathroom full of useless products...who cares? Plus great prices on this
B003T3TVGY|4|I have external psoriasis on my ears and back of my scalp due to the stress of a legacy back injury. I had used the Rx Clobetasol (a steroid) with moderate success, it improves the symptoms temporarily as long as I continue to use it. When I lost insurance, I could not get Clobetasol (liquid is very expensive at over $70 for a 4 oz bottle). After some research I found Edguard Cream, and it does the trick. It acts the same as the Rx strength lotion (it is likely not as strong as the Rx strength) for a very reasonable price. I would assume that this &#34;Body Lotion&#34; is similar to the cream, and I recommend it for this type of use.
B006Z757D2|1|No good, small and cheap don't purchase.
B005FLODXE|5|Love, love, love this rinse!!  I use the shampoo with it and my hair is soft and smooth.  I'm 44 years old and love the smell of lemon.  It is light and not strong.  I also use the Bliss Butter moisturizer on my body after a shower.  Fantastic!! Soft and smooth!!!  Good company, good products!!
B00C1BLQA4|4|The clip in wasnt as dark as I hoped, but for the length you can't beat the price! I've been wearing it braided at work all day, it stays secure and doesn't irritate the scalp. It does feel real, like chemical treated hair but I still love it!!
B00Q3N72YA|5|This set smells amazing!  It was the first thing I noticed when I opened the box.  The products are all natural and they feel great on the skin.  Given the harsh winter we have had, the moisturizing products feel great.  I would highly recommend!
B00D5FZCY6|5|My wife swears about this product especially when she has a headache, she puts it on her head and after a few minutes she gets relief. Will be buying a lot more bottles in the future.
B0037QGE9A|2|Good Cleanser. I used it for about 2 months. Unfortunately it did not do anything about the redness. I felt that my face was cleaner after using it but the redness did not go away.
B00GCW0D0C|5|Nice for those of us that like to slide something into the rear for male enjoyment.  Touching the prostate is a wonderful sensation to the men that need a little charge to stimulate themselves.  A lot of men wouldn't admit that it does feel good to stimulate the prostate for pure enjoyment.
B00N9PVXIQ|2|When I opened the package and took the headband out, one of the rhinestones had already fallen off so I had to glue it back on before I could even wear it. You get what you pay for.
B000L596FE|4|I do like this brush, the bristles are pretty thin and flimsy, so on the top of my head when it is hard to brush i have to press down unlike my old brush, but this one leaves my hair feeling smoother and makes it easier to brush, it's als bigger than i expected, which is a good thing.
B000K73KCI|5|The Body Shop Camomile Gentle Eye Makeup Remover Regular - 8.4 fl oz;  Bought This As A Gift For My Sister So I Can Only Imagine That It's A Good Product.
B00L3LBUGI|5|It is working for me, better than most I have tried.  I am using all 3 cream, vitamin c and mask.  I have tried many.  I may stick with this one.
B004YBW5T0|3|I've ordered this item twice and it came from different sellers each time (about a week or so apart). The first time it was in a 1lb tray and white as snow. The second time it came in a round tub and was ugly yellow and was actually only 15 oz (though the tub said 16oz).<br /><br />I made my body butter with it anyway, but it was slightly disappointing.<br /><br />My first order shows sold by Aspen Naturals and I'd jump at the chance to buy from them again. My second from SimplyBeautiful and I'll avoid them like the plague.<br /><br />Lesson learned, buyer beware.
B001CX4JSS|2|Got this for a X-Mas present and it doesn't do the job @ all...not a good investment, would not recommend buying this item...there are much better toothbrushes on the market!
B007OQQDCC|5|I have been using this lipstick for years and I love the shade.  I'm very sad that L'oreal discontinued the shade.  I'm glad I was able to purchase the few that was left at amazon
B003VMZTCI|5|love the color it is a dark purple and doesn't look black or blue which i love. if you are new to using shellac do LIGHT layers. It will peal and chip quicker if you do it to thick. only do 2 light layers over a base coat and cover in a light top coat.
B00F029PWC|4|They r great, all received well, just don't like that they sit so flat on the nail, its almost better to just make ur own from scratch on the nail.
B000P22UEM|4|I love Jungle Gardenia but it is a bit expensive for me right now so I got this instead. I like it but not as much as Jungle Gardenia. It does smell good though. I recommend it.
B002XITZ08|5|I have worn Cool Water for years. It's always been one of my favorites.
B005CRJUEI|1|It does not work....I've used 1 full tube and have another and will use it, but so far nothing has changed....How do I know this?  Because I took a picture of my hands when I first started and there's nothing different,,,,,,,,I'm so darn sorry that it didn't work because my hands realy need to be the help.
B004YNE8K2|5|Absolutely the only leave-in cream that gives body to my fine, very fine hair. Without it my hair frizzes; with it I &#34;crunch&#34; and get curls. Holds through the day. It began to disappear from the hair care shelves. Thank goodness I can still get it through Amazon.
B00QU7CVKE|5|I got the bib for a handicap woman, perfect .She is been using all the time to keep herself clean. Big enough, good quality.
B00AYDN0JG|5|Love this lotion!
B00756HQNQ|5|This has saved my heels.  I've tried so many things over the years, nothing worked (lotions, pumice stones etc).  A couple minutes of this every few weeks and my heels are golden.  They not only look better but then I don't get cracks.  It's very easy to use and does not hurt.
B002E7NCLQ|3|This razor shaves well when the blade is brand new, but some design flaws in the blade head make it difficult to use multiple times.<br /><br />The plastic backing behind the blades does not allow water to flow through, so it is impossible to clean out residue and whiskers.  Additionally, tapping the razor on the sink to clear out the blades is not an option, because the attachment of the blade head to the rest of the cartridge is via a few small plastic tabs that have broken on me multiple times.<br /><br />I guess an advantage for this razor is that the replacement blades are pretty cheap, so you can buy a shelf-full.  But you are going to go through them faster than you will for other brands.  So, overall it's probably a wash.
B00CNWJ9GO|5|Comfortable.  Didn't pull hair.  The color wasn't too bright or glossy - definitely like it.
B005CRED1S|5|I love this so much. This is my new signature fragrance. I just love all of the notes in this.  I would describe this scent as spicy, but not overly spicy.  It just smells sexy!  Men love this on me.
B00D6KTSNG|3|I used this in a little burner that I have for essential oils.  It is a mild, slightly sweet smell.  I wish it was a little stronger. I would just buy the candles from now on.
B002OE79CC|4|This product works well for the &#34;nasty.&#34;  It handles nose and ear hairs well.  I wouldn't consider it adequate for anything more challenging.  Leave that to your barber or hair stylist.
B006UOFJH4|1|I used this product three times in three days. I did what the directions said... I washed my face with an oil free moisture scrub and put it on before bed. On the third day of using this stuff I woke up and couldn't even smile from the dry skin and the 1st degree burn it gave me. I hardly put any cream on my face too!
B00205TSH4|5|I went thru menopause instantly after a total hysterectomy 15 years ago and subsequently my hair did thin some; However, now I am having severe thyroid and adrenal problems and my hair was falling out pretty bad and my scalp has also become very sensitive.  This shampoo and conditioner is very soothing to my scalp and definitely makes my hair appear thicker....I will difinitely keep using and hope as my endocrine problems get under control that I will be seeing new growth in my hair......this was a great deal for Nioxin which can be very expensive.
B003338B02|5|I love this product.
B002HEW8I4|1|I only tan in the winter and spring and I just so happened to buy this at the end of tanning season last year. Thank Goodness. It looks like soap, it smells like soap, and instead of bronzing with it I turned red as a beet. I have been tanning for at least 10 years so I am not a beginner. This was liquid soap.
B00L4SCGYK|4|I like that while it is white on the outside, so the color won't transfer to your pillowcase, it's black on the inside so it keeps more light out. However, there's still a bit of light coming in around the bottom edge - but even my memory foam mask lets a little light in around the nose. In bright light it probably blocks out 80-90% of light but when your eyes are closed you won't notice this. Lastly, although it's made of silk, it's slightly &#34;sanded&#34; so might not be as slick as you expect. I'm quite satisfied with it.
B0085PMFHI|5|The iron works really, really good, i am well satisfied with my purchase. i recommand it to anyone that wants something good and economical.
B007T6VSCW|5|A must have for removing polish and cleaning up around the nails after you have done a manicure on yourself!
B00IM7O15S|3|Nothing happen
B00016KMD8|5|Great product. It's small enough to store and it holds a good amount of wax
B00JZ017L2|5|This has always been a favorite and still is.
B000C1VXQ2|5|Very nice
B000XE4CQG|1|Smells horrible... Family said it smells like fried pork chops
B0014P8L9W|5|My family had been using this product for over 20 years to pull infections out of BIG and small wounds/bites :) we wouldn't be without it
B004SJLTHC|5|Smells great, last a long time. Always a nice buy!
B001TK4LM8|5|okay so first of all the shipping was super quick which is always amazing. But most of all this eyeliner can be used for so many other things! you can use it as a base, eyeliner, highlight, and much more its just simply amazing.! 5 STARS.!&lt;333
B00RFYVWN8|5|So easy to use, great quality.  Thank you
B0050PZ0SW|4|I finally found the perfect combination shampoo, condition and leave in conditioner that works wonders on my daughter's hair and they smell great too!!
B00BK3T6JM|1|You need to try other product intead of this, doesn't wiorks
B001ET7IY2|5|I bought this a couple of months ago and just love it!  I also bought the toothpaste and gum.  It was pricey, but if you don't want bad breath it's worth it!<br /><br />I only use 2 pumps of each bottle twice a day instead of 4 pumps ( I read that on other's people's reviews on [...] and amazon.com) It does the job and lasts twice as long.<br /><br />I would and will buy it again!
B0029F7LUG|5|I'm loving this company and their products! I highly recommend them to anyone that wants to have healthy lifestyles !
B0020ZEA40|5|[[VIDEOID:moQ7K7XI35291Q]]I really wanted to do a video review but I only had limited time so the video has been unedited. :o<br /><br />I've been using this product with great results over the past 3 days. I'm acne prone and this has NOT broken me out! It's really fabulous, just be sure to treat it like makeup and wash it off before you go to sleep. :)<br /><br />About the seller (seoulglamour): AWESOME! Shipping was super fast (2 weeks earlier arrival than the earliest predicted arrival date). Additionally, the seller sent me other BB Cream samples. :)
B003A3I7XG|5|Aloe Vera Butter is a very excellent product to use, when making DIY bath & body products. I LOVE the way it makes the skin feel ❤❤❤
B00HZHKTEI|5|This is honest to God the exact duplicate of the Urban Decay Naked 2 eyeshadow pallet. I loveeee it! I have used the naked 2 pallet and I can say. This is hands down just as good as the urban decay one!
B003TQTZ4Y|1|I ordered 4 sunblocks, and the arrived with no top cap (as clearly shown in the picture). I can´t carry them around at all with no cap, as it spreads everywhere.
B001KYRNAK|5|I've been using this mascara on my lower lashes for years. As an Asian, it is difficult to find a waterproof mascara that can be easily applied due to our eye shape and how close the lashes are to our skin. The short bristle length makes it much easier to NOT make mascara marks on the skin below the lashes.
B000EBIDJ0|3|I've only had this item for a few weeks and as of now, I haven't noticed a great change in my skin or ingrown hairs which is why I purchased the product.
B005ME8WK4|4|Great machine for the price.
B0045XE3AG|3|It's tough to say whether these are better or worse than the once-a-day variety, because it's tough to judge whitening.  I will say that I did not notice a big difference, which was disappointing.  I think that what they give you in ease of use they lose in the perception of whitening, though I don't have studies to say they actually fall short.  So, while it's possible that I'm simply over emphasizing the feeling of accomplishment for strips which require a few days use, I'm going back to those rather than keep using these.<br /><br />They're not bad, but I'd expected \\"express\\" strips to give more of a \\"wow\\" when I was done.
B001ET73JM|5|I have horribly sensitive, yet oily skin.  This, along with Johnson & Johnson's Purpose--they're almost exactly the same product--is the only cleanser that I can use.  It helps cleanse away the excess oil without making the skin overly tight, preventing both irritation and breakouts.  Acne-prone people should use this with a good, sightly nubby washcloth (for exfoliation) and top with your favorite acne medication (I like Acnomel, which seems to be the best full-spectrum preventative for my skin).
B00HB2ARDU|4|This is a replacement for my old-old Norelco (with the vacuum to suck up my shorn whiskers) and my third Norelco trimmer. This one is quieter, FAR less irritating to the skin (pretty much zero irritation), and charges seem to last forever! The rotate around head that goes from wide trim to detail is extremely convenient--especially for travel. The ONLY reason I took away a star is that I saw today that the released a new unit for whole-head grooming that I might like better! Not enough to return this one in order to get it, but certainly enough to leave room open for that 5-star rating.
B00HNKRYP4|3|i received this lotion as a trial from influenster.  It was super convenient to spray on, but the sent was a little to strong.  my husband has only used it once or twice, rather than our normal vaseline lotion that we use.  he agreed that the sent was too strong, and didn't allow him to wear cologne
B007FTQNJ6|5|I choose to go with Amazon instead of the local sleep center for my mask.<br />They charge $185 for the same mask. That is if I have met my deductible for the year, if not it is 250.<br />Delivered on time and was a great buy.<br />Same quality as the other masks.
B0029MVMAE|3|It's ok I guess... smells nice... got it thinking that Paul Mitchell was more like salon quality... but discovered it's still full of hair destroying sulphates.
B00F008GFQ|5|This is an Amazing brush!  It's suuuper soft, doesn't shed and super dense! It rivals my Sigma F80 brush without the price tag (I bought it for $11.97). One thing to mention though, it doesn't dry as fast as my real Techniques brushes, which is also made from synthetic taklon bristles. But that's not even a big issue,  overall I'd recommend. 😊
B000C1Z6NS|5|my mom's favorite perfume
B00FVZB0YY|4|This is thin and lightweight, but seems quite sturdy.  I use it for hats and it works well.
B003O7JM78|4|I have light very light skin with lots of freckles. I think most foundations and powders make me look washed out and cakey. But this stuff makes my skin look great.    This is all i wear for a nice even and natural look. It's not heavy and a little goes a long way. It evens out my skin tone and helps cover problem areas without looking over done.     The only con is that the pump doesn't work very well, but that may just be my bottle.
B0019GAX8I|5|I just love this stuff, it's great for styling and does not produce flakes......I give it 7 out of 6 if I could
B0014KQSE2|4|Gives volume without stiffness with only a tablespoon size amount,  Hair looks even better the next day.  No greasy buildup.  Have been using Kerastase mousse for 2 years.
B001GS6OB4|5|Hurts like hell but love it!!!!!!!!  Get use to the pain but gets all the hair and it stays away much longer than shaving.
B00LSY6GFU|5|Great nail clippers.  They're heavy enough to cut stubborn corns.  Good buy.
B00OOSBW5Q|4|Works great, but I prefer the older  models digital pad.
B0009MFUPY|5|Great Product
B009Q1YQ5Y|5|This is a reasonably priced eyeshadow that works great.
B007ADJZC4|5|Like the best stuff for your skin very made
B0071GQQ4U|3|I can't say there is anything exceptional about this shower gel. It happened to be selling at a decent price, but I prefer Nivea's citrus (orange) scent to this one. I can't really say this one is any more hydrating than Nivea's other shower gels either. It's not bad, but not something I can rave about. It's not drying and, to me, that's all that really matters
B001A7WV0Y|5|Had a few small bare patches show up from stress on head and in beard. This stuff worked great. The spots were only an inch or so in size. The only drawback is, you would probably have to reapply during the day if you touched the area. Otherwise, for small patches, product worked great.
B00FS2N3FE|5|This was a Birthday present for my husband and he loves it.
B005OKUWL8|5|Its works wonders. Ive tried tons of products that will not dry my hair out after a shampoo. This works for me. I will continue to use this.
B00008IHO4|5|This was recommended (well, required really) by my dermatologist for me to use every day.  I have always had a problem with other sunscreens leaving my skin feeling oily and slick but it's not a problem with this sunblock. It also has a nice fragrance which is great since I don't want to smell like I should be at the beach.  It works well under foundation or powder and it doesn't break out my oily skin. My skin can be sensitive too and I have not had the burning that another reviewer has reported.  I highly recommend it.
B001U582SQ|5|Perfect & fast delivery
B001FXUTUM|5|Tried to go with the knock off at first....don't do it!!! This tool is much more effective and gets way better results. Very pleased that I decided to try this.
B0080JF936|5|Great stuff and no white mess on clothes
B00EYMWQRA|5|I tried this product at a friends house & ordered it not 5 minutes later (ordered on Saturday evening, post office is closed Sundays, Monday was a holiday, and arrived on Wednesday). I have very sensitive skin & normally have to stick with bland lotions. This lotion goes on very lightly, while still moisturizing better than any others I've tried, and has a very nice scent as well (reminds me of Juicy). There's no way to feel like you've applied too much lotion. Can't wait to try more Hempz products!
B000IG83VE|5|It's lighter than some reviewers have said, and I'm comparing it to a similar &#34;professional grade&#34; blow dryer of similar wattage.  I have fairly long and extremely curly hair, so I needed something that would get me through a blow dry without taking most of my morning, creating frizz and making my arms tired.  This one is compact and strong, and is light enough to get the job done.  I also love that I can now tell people I own a Ferrari.  Well, it's a blow dryer, but still . . . it's a Ferarri.  I think you'll be happy with it if you pick one up.  I've been using it for a month, and no complaints.  My previous expensive one lasted 5+ years so I hope this one has the same life span.
B0017JUVTI|5|This is the first time I ever used this scent and I was not disappointed. This scent has a nice vanilla background and is good for either day or night. A little goes a long way.
B0027LSEPS|4|The new Panasonic irrigator has a battery compartment and electrodes similar to the previous model (EW1270AC), so I'm sure the same comments apply:<br /><br />My old irrigator gave out after 5 years of travel-only use. It occasionally wouldn't switch on, finally wouldn't switch on at all. Batteries were good. I scraped the (-) contact in the battery compartment cap and the (+) contact at the bottom of the battery compartment with a straightened-out wire coat hanger and it worked again.<br /><br />These contacts do corrode. If you're not going to use the device for a while, take the batteries out and leave the battery compartment cap off for a few days to let the contacts dry thoroughly.<br /><br />This Panny supplies higher water pressure than the old model but not as  much as my WaterPik (WP100) and I wouldn't rely on it for daily use. However, it's great for travel. Note the WaterPik cordless models (WP360, WP450) have  a 110-120 vac charger rating rather than the 110-240 vac that all my other plug-in portable devices have, so the WaterPik can't be used in Europe with a plug adapter; you'd need a (heavy and bulky) step-down transformer.<br /><br />And I wouldn't use any dental irrigator as a substitute for daily flossing.
B000G647Y8|4|I bought this item after being \\"treated\\" by my family to a more expensive line of \\"art\\"-istic shaving gear (their cheapest brush, the one I have, is $55, and you can spend up to $1200).  I got hooked on the experience of using a brush after years of foams that left me with razor bumps and irritated skin.  The brush isn't the singular answer to this problem, but it helps.  I got the \\"Tweezerman\\" based pretty much on price, and that is was a badger hair brush (there is a difference between badger hair and synthetic, for sure).  I wanted to have a brush I could take with me on trips, and leave the other one at home.  This brush is at least as good as the original brush I have.  It holds water well and makes great lather.  Get this one - can't beat it for the price.
B00G7ZC4AG|5|So far I love it! Def tingles/burns a little but did not leave my face red at all. Noticing the difference it's making on my pores. Using at least 3xs a week.
B0035CTRHW|4|I have lots of fine hair. I have a hard time finding a conditioner that smooths and moisturizers without weighing down my hair. I think this product does a good job of both. On really cold, dry days it's still a little staticky, but I think in those conditions it would be hard to avoid that. Overall, I like and would buy again.
B00517W45G|5|I switched from a rotary due to a dead battery and I like this shaver better. A little more compact and holds a charge well.
B0006M56BK|4|I got these because I knew the brand from way back when. I had no idea about choosing blades when I bought them. Now I would recommend these if you have tried them before and liked them, otherwise get a sampler and work your way through as many blades as you can find. There's no &#34;best&#34; blade for everyone, just the best blade for you in a particular razor.
B00K5T5N08|1|I used this product for years. I recently bought a 4 pk of it form a wholesale club and much to my dismay they seemed to have changed the formula. It's so runny now that the pressure when I pull off the cap causes it to fly out of the container and onto mirrors, floors, dressers etc. I guess it's time to try for find another brand now. They should have left well enough alone!
B0086STZ4K|5|Buy this product
B007SOJ6WE|2|I BOUGHT AS A SAMPLE- IT JUST TINGLES YOUR LIPS DOES NOT PLUMP LIKE IT CLAIMS. IT DOES MAKE THEM SMOOTHER. SELLER WAS GREAT AND SHIPPED IT FAST THOUGH
B0023XF60Q|5|I like the product, even though the shave is about the same as the gel I previously used, because of the additional benefits, as follow:  less messy, can use it w/ my wet/dry electric (2 drops), very compact bottle for travel in a toiletries bag and the container is clear, so that you can tell when it's almost gone, something that you can't do w/ a metal can. As a result, I will continue using it as long as it is made.
B000FTQGHM|4|Soap is great.  Been using it for 40 years, however, it arrived at my house with shipping box ripped open and several individual soap boxes severely crushed.
B00VSTRMNU|5|My boyfriend got me a set for our anniversary, as it was my first time using bath bombs and it was an awesome experience! The packaging is beautiful in itself, and it felt like a spa day experience! Would highly recommend for gifts for your girl, or just to treat yoself!
B00JVXVCS6|5|Very good. Recommend definitely
B00AAJTDLI|5|Great shampoo. Smells great too!
B000FEF1V4|1|I like the concept of this trimmer with the vacuum and all, but I'm really annoyed that the people who make these things won't tell you what lengths the comb settings will trim to.  Even if you go to a store to look at one, they have it all sealed in plastic that you have to cut open just to take a look at it.  So I got this thing home to see if it would trim to my preferred length, and no it won't.  I'm liking the stubble look, and about 3-4 days growth looks best on me.  This trimmer only goes down to what represents 7-8 days growth for me.  I have another Panasonic trimmer that works fine, but it has the same issue.  I can take the comb off and cut the stubble down to about one day's length and then let it grow back a few days, but I'm getting really tired of doing that.  I think these manufacturers should specify their trimming lengths so you can do a reasonable buying comparison.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|Works well, brush after brush. Good quality, as pictured, work well as the manufacture describes. I love this product. Would suggest to for great dental care.
B007M81A6Q|5|Ok so I have never ever written a review but I just had to for this. I did not buy it on amazon but from a beauty store only because it was on clearance. I bought it because I was going down the shore(then Vegas) and wanted a little color coverage with the benefit of sunscreen. I have tons of sun damage on my face and neck and it's way past time for me to start taking care of my skin. The first time I used it, it looked a little orange but then adjusted to my skin tone. It also just tingled so slightly, but I figured that meant it was working. I did not feel it again after that first time. I used it for a week while I was down the shore n was very pleased with the look and feel on my face, not too greasy and nice and light. My daughter noticed I had some dry skin on my face and I was surprised at that because it didn't feel like it was drying out my skin at all. Well, when I went to remove the dry skin, guess what else came off with it: my ugly brown damaged spots!! It was like I was using an eraser, I couldn't believe it!! I had big splotchy areas on both sides of my face that were brown and they have been erased!<br />I had no idea that would be an added bonus! I am going to start using this religiously on my chest as well. This stuff is a miracle worker, age eraser!! And if you want a more matte look I found that just putting some finishing powder on top does the trick. It's not enough coverage for foundation, but for a daytime look and sunscreen protection in one, it can't be beat!!! I bought the light to medium and it works well for my summer tanned skin(it's kinda dark but sheer at the same time) will definitely be purchasing this again and buying the lighter shade for my winter skin. So pleased to have found something that actually delivers on its claims.
B000R80ZTQ|3|I have had this dryer for about a year now and it has held up great, has great power and is hot enough.  I have medium length & thick hair just past my shoulders and my hair will dry completely with this dryer in 7 minutes.  My only complaint is that the plug is really loose to the wall so I have to plug it into an adapter I have otherwise it will literally fall out of the wall plug.  Also it is very short cord even when pulled out all of the way.  Sometimes when trying to retract the cord it gets stuck and wont go in all of the way so I have to keep pulling it in and out to try to get it to reel up all the way.  When it does this it makes me just want to wrap the cord around the dryer negating the whole idea of the reel.  Overall its been a good dryer though and am glad I have it and it was a good price.
B000C1Z6KG|5|I love this scent!! Thank you for the fast delivery and great price!
B006KXD2GU|5|Cheap in price and one of my favorite blades to shave with
B001G7PMV8|5|I'm so happy that Subscribe & Save is available on this item. My husband goes through razors so quickly that I'm sure Warren Buffett is truly grateful. But it's all worth it when my special guy feels well cared for when, like magic, I'm ready with a fresh supply whenever he starts to run low. Please, nobody tell him that I don't even have to think about it, and Amazon does all the work!
B000E1VWA2|4|This oil doesn't come with a dropper so it's not easy to measure. It seems very pure though, and does the job.
B00008DQJQ|4|I purchased a 7526 Factory Recon.  It gives a great shave like all of the braun shavers I have had over the past 25 years.  One problem is that it came with the on off switch malfunctioning.  Perhaps it was checked quite carefully enough or it was damaged in shipping.  I am returning to get the same model.  I like the shave but can't deal with the shaver going off if I don't hold the face firmly in place while shaving.
B009MKETVU|5|This is the perfect color for me. I am blonde with green eyes and it is really flattering.
B000RFS118|5|use it every week since i bought it. dont even have to shave anymore
B003B3Q6L0|5|Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood  is a great product<br />Not a strong scent and you can't go wrong with this
B00BNRV6JS|5|great sexy scent, not to strong, or overpowering, very soft great price.
B00PC7YI0Y|5|Fantastic trade.
B009L6714C|4|The little plastic tubes lasted longer than instructions indicated. Left open too long, they dry out. Did the trick while I shopped for a regular size version.
B004S6LIBM|1|Right pic but the wrong product was mailed . I was very dissatisfied .''
B009WMZSZO|5|I use this every day. Works so well! My hair tends to be frizzy but this flat iron straightens it in a second
B007CN7I7G|1|I purchased the size large in the body shaper based on my bra size 36C.  This shaper was entirely to large & did nothing for me<br />it would have cost me more money to return it.  So I will just take the lost.
B005V3DVKW|5|Amazing soap. When I was a kid my mom had found some &#34;egg soaps&#34; from a boutique shop and never could find them again. Finally I came across these and they don't look the same as the ones my mom originally loved, but they work wonderfully and smell like bliss! I bought a box for Mothers Day and my mom loves everything from the whimsical designs on the box and the soap itself! Put some on a washcloth and gently rub away the day's dirt and it'll leave you skin soft and even!
B002GDKRJ8|5|The Cupcake Pink dye lasts a very long time and makes an adorable baby pink when diluted with conditioner!
B000QU8Q0A|5|[[ASIN:B000QU8Q0A Olay Body Wash, Age Defying, with Vitamin E 23.6 fl oz (700 ml)]] I also love this brand of Olay, because it works very well for me.  Disappointed because Amazon. com will be charging taxes because I live in Texas, think this is not fair and I do love to order this product in bulk, but, at the time I ordered this there was not any in bulk, and now I see that there is, depending upon the taxes, will esoon let me know if I will order from Amazon.com again, because, I beleive that as a consumer, I should have been notified in some way, because I receive most of the advertising that Amazon.com has to offer, but, the product in itself is very, very good.
B00GOXONG4|4|This is a great tanning lotion it dont have any of the after tanning smell and it leaves your skin very soft but I personally like Black Ink better I like the color that Black Ink better.
B00AMLHK00|5|Screen & Cutter is working at 100% Frank A Trombino
B0050QM1BK|5|I don't think I have ever been this excited about anything that I have bought before!<br />First off-the packaging-AWESOME<br />The look- CUTE<br />The feel in my hands-COMFORTABLE<br />The feel on my scalp- SMOOTH, GENTLE, THERAPEUTIC!<br /><br />My husband even tested it and remarked how nice it felt on his scalp. (Goto watch him now in case he decides to snitch it! Lol)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this brush as an everyday brush.<br /><br />Having said that- I also bought one of the flat vented ones for blow drying my hair. I think that one is a lot more sturdy and hence better for that specific task.
B003RW2K0G|4|I think it made my hair really soft but the smell is very strong!!!! It smells like argan oil + aftershave x10000. Lol but the next day I guess the smell absorbed into my hair because it wasn't as stronge.
B00112BTME|5|I love this lip liner have had many . I also love the plum shade.
B0085RZLQS|5|I feel like I have been to the hygienist after brushing my teeth with  sonicare.  I have used the sonicare before and I really like it.
B009QZCAM6|2|It does not meet expectations from advertising and is like mascara for the eyebrows.
B0043OYFKU|4|I like the way it feels like my skin is getting cleaner and it really helps exfoliate and deep cleanse.  No complaints.  I like this for my face, neck and chest.  I use this with other face wash products that I use also.  Good price and I like that it works in the shower!
B00AFWVHI2|1|I bought this toothbrush, and really liked the flossing bristles and silver treatment.<br /><br />However, I soon found out the bristles are made with PBT plastic (Polybutylene Terephtalates). It appears many companies are switching from nylon bristles, which seem to have been safer, to phtalate based bristles - probably because they last longer. As a scientist aware of what they are, I just can't keep using anything made with these bristles.<br /><br />If you know the research on phtalates' effect as endocrine disruptors, you know how terrible they are, being associated with reproductive defects, endocrine problems, and cancer. This is well controlled scientific research, too.<br /><br />Being in the process of cutting BPA, phtalates, and other harmful (most) plastics out of my life, I can't really keep using this toothbruth. Plus, if you are trying to conceive or undergo IVF, phtalates can really lower your chances of success, due to causing chromosomal abnormalities (read Improving Egg Quality, and It Starts with the Egg books, all citing solid scientific papers).<br /><br />If Mouth Watchers would make these with nylon bristles, I would rebuy instantly. Or better yet, if the industry would come up with non-petroleum/plastic based bristles that worked reasonably well.<br /><br />UPDATE: Based on requests on the comments, here is a link to a 2012 report by the EPA on the effects of phtalates. Pages 4, 6, and 7 contain information most relevant to humans. Feel free to draw your own conclusions!<br /><br />[...]
B00EOB0042|5|This is the first natural deodorant I have tried after doing my research.  I am so glad I switched from aluminum filled antipersperants!  This does not stop you from sweating but I feel like I sweat less.  The smell is great too. I don't smell like B.O. like I did with regular antipersperants.  I highly recommend this product! I am ordering more!
B00385WMIM|5|Nice shower cap.  The material it is made of is substantial, not like those cheap hotel-provided caps, and has good elastic so that you shouldn't have water leakage problems.  The flowers are fun.
B007RTR8A2|4|I have been using Clear shampoo along with Clear conditioner to care for my long hair.  The scent and texture do not stand out in any way, but what I look for is results.<br /><br />I consider my shampoo a positive success if it helps me avoid split ends and dry, flaky scalp.  So far, my hair looks great.  I continue to get compliments on my silky, shiny hair, so the shampoo is doing its job.  I like it.
B00I11RWDS|3|not a difference really from regular mascara, just more things to do..
B004KN2SLW|5|Just what I needed!
B0009R15Z8|5|this is the powder that best control the shine on my face, for more time than others expensive powders. really like it!!
B0036ZA40W|3|I have very sensitive teeth and gums was was looking for a toothbrush that is gentle to use.  I have not found this toothbrush to be the answer for me. It is better than some.  But I finally was given a softer bristled toothbrush by my dental hygeniest called Plak Smacker Ultra Gentle.  It works!  I have yet to find them in any store so I can purchase it myself.
B008JD4PGU|5|An exact replacement for what my wife needed for her CPAP machine. It has made her so much happier in the morning.
B005QG52F6|4|I really like this product . My hair is difficult and curly and this is one of the few things that works.
B00KNZ9YLS|2|Will snap on, but cutter comes off when removing to clean.
B007ZXR4I6|5|If you have fine hair the 200 degree setting is enough for you. Two passes and it's shiny and smooth city. This is worth the investment so treat yourself. I do wish it would save the degree setting each time you turn it off but otherwise I am very happy with it.
B000GG0NAU|5|I used to get this at Walgreen's for $.99 but could not find it anymore.  Amazon provided a connection to purchase, but it was $2.99 and will not order this anymore from Amazon.  While I love the product, I refuse to spend triple the original amount.
B00E6BH4IU|5|So portable and stylish ~ does a great and super fast job! Love my 5-45 Gelish led lamp! Will recommend to all
B002LP7KQE|5|Husband needed to replace shaver foil and since the shaver is an older model did not know if we could find one.  He had never replaced his heads and it sure was overdue.  Replacement arrived in as scheduled and changing over to new heads was a snap.<br />He loves it, says the shaver is just like new.
B006OZF3DY|2|I purchased this product but was dissapointed with it, it has no coverage at all. And as a primer I wasn't impressed either.
B00KOSWTX4|1|The &#34;spray gun&#34; cap broke within about 10 uses. Cheap cheap packaging.
B00LBDX1QA|5|Seriously, the best flat iron! I have very thick, wavy, Mediterranean hair and have been using a Chi flat iron for years. This flat iron blows the Chi out of the water! It takes me a LOT less time to flat iron my hair with the BaByliss. Careful though! The top heat setting (450 degrees) may be too hot for you - it was for me. There are lower heat settings you can use, so just choose what is best for your hair.
B0043OSIVM|5|Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength Dandruff Shampoo  14.2 Fl Oz is an excellent product and really gets my hair CLEAN.<br />It is good for the scalp, too.  I'm ordering it again.
B00AREI56U|1|Leaves a white residue, it's nasty.
B00CC89OQE|5|Absolutely wonderful.
B002G3K1TY|5|I love this polish, my one dislike is it chips easy but it makes each color a little different. I love it.
B000GHDI2E|4|I love the scrub sponge side.  I'm recovering from back surgery and am not able to bend, so this item has been extremely helpful.  However, the sponge part which I'm not even using fell off after a few weeks.
B0086VI9TE|5|even though the image is not a product photo, rest assured these brush heads will fit. Included are three heads for the Philips Sonicare Proresults toothbrush, each including a small plastic head protector.
B0087B9IE8|5|I love, love this stuff.  Problem is I can't find it in stores anymore.  Thankfully Amazon has it but there's only one bottle left.  I put it on my nails every other day and in no time I can see longer nails.  I've tried other products but they made my nails yellow.  If you can find this product don't hesitate to give it a try.  Then you'll be in the same boat I'm in....looking for it in every beauty supply store you can find.<br /><br />Now here's the deal breaker.  The product costs $4.60.  Amazon wants to charge me $4.99 to ship it to me.  Ain't gonna happen.  So if somebody else wants to buy it, I'm cancelling my order.  As much as I love this product I'm no fool to pay more on shipping then what the product is worth.
B005K2ISOI|5|I cant say enough about the scrubs,im a 45 male and everyone thinks im 30.the co.is so helpful and easy to work with...
B008FGVF0K|5|Nice package with reasonable price. Large-enough to use for single male consumer. Proven Lab series product with great belief. Completely satisfied what I've got.
B00ID8H4OG|4|This curling iron is super cute...I love the colors and design. Besides that, it just seems to be pretty basic to me. I'm not sold on the whole oil infused thing either. The heat range is awesome and gets hot pretty quickly, the swivel cord makes it easy to maneuver and doesn't tangle easily. Overall it holds a nice bouncy curl.
B000F7KBUC|4|A little too oily, but still good.
B004SPDEWE|5|Works beautifully!! makeup stays put!  my skin is super oily, and this helps it my concealer, and eyemakeup stay intact.
B0051BV8ZE|4|Have used it once, was surprised to see so much lathering for a sulfate free shampoo, did seem to moisture my hair as it cleansed, so far so good.
B00C9M506G|5|I started out a month ago with a $34 Merkur razor and blades.  The blades were not very sharp at all--so I got feather blades.  After getting feather blades, i started to wonder how much better their Feather DE $175 razor was.  so...i took the plunge.<br /><br />I could not believe how much better the shave was.  it was AWESOME.  couldn't even feel it cutting hair.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  if you don't like it, put it on Ebay or badgerandblade.com.  I'm sure you could get most of your money back.
B00BB5YHEI|5|Recommend this razor for snyone! Excellent shave and affordable.
B003KJBK3E|3|Flimsy.
B003PXZI2O|1|This product does not clean hair.  It makes hair a greasy mess, even when you follow all of the directions to the T.  It has taken 3 washes to get my hair to not look greasy.  If I could give it negative stars I would have!
B000F6RFX4|4|I like the smell of this soap, it is light and not overwhelming. It reminds me of going to the spa. Doesn't dry my sensitive skin. Just have to remember to rinse the shower well or it will leave black at the bottom. It does clean up well though.
B00PR786IE|5|high quality brush. I have 2 from beauty junkees and I reach for them daily. I will be buying more. Dense brush and none of the hairs fall out even when washing. Very impressed.
B00HN6ILCI|1|Does not work.  Have used every 2 weeks for 4 months with no reduction in hair.  Amazon will only return within 30 days.  Way too much mony to spend on something that does not even work 1%.
B0009VNI5E|5|My hair is crazy thick and heavy, this product tightens up my very wavy hair and makes it look curly.  It's the best, and as far as I can tell no longer carried locally by CVS or walgreens where I used to get it.
B00BN1MP5S|3|too small
B0017OLMVE|5|It worked the way I expected.
B00BXPUIBM|1|The powder is way to dark! And it stains clothes! And spills everywhere! I do not like it at all.
B00Q8ORTD8|1|don't last not very coarse
B00SETTAUA|4|Pretty good. Not their best. Works well in shower.
B000052YBV|5|This product is no longer available where I live,but Amazon had it and I will order it again when needed.I have always found what I needed at Amazon at reasonable prices.Amazon can't be beat as far as I am concerned.Thanks Amazon!!
B0084EGSW8|5|I've been painting my nails for Many years & although the colors are many and pretty, none have compared to this product!  It's just a tint of color, not heavy or lacquered feeling.  Alas, it was discontinued.  I was so sad!!  I Absolutely Love This Product!  On the off chance of finding it on Amazon (since they carry almost Everything imaginable) I looked & to my glee there it was!!!  I wanted to order every bottle available but I knew it wouldn't keep so ordered only 1.
B00538TSMU|1|they sent me two of the thin eyelashes they dont give you what you see in the picture im not happy at all!
B004L4EING|5|My husband loved both the soap and the real badger-hair brush; he told me that it made shaving much more enjoyable and easier. He uses a vibrating Gillette razor and it worked well with the set.
B000ICPTSS|5|Just what I wanted
B0030HNNS6|3|I bought this in the store and  I loved it! I went researching and found it to be cheaper on here. Except after close examination I believe the one I received to he a fake. The bottom did.not have ridges, the jar was not filled with as much,  the glass was merky, the writing was bolder, the gel had a slightly different consistency,.the brushes were noticeably different, and the part of the jar where the lid screws on was lowered a bit. I dint know if this seller received a fake and sent it unknowingly, or he knows.this and.is trying to mAke more money. I love this eye liner, but I can't give 5 stars becAuse it was fake.
B003S9FIPM|3|I haven't used it yet. The quality is ok.  Not as heavy duty as others I have bought.  I think it will get the job done.
B000VUX4T8|1|I have fine hair and this product made my hair dry and break right after the treatment.  Beware!!!
B00GQJJY9W|4|No problems installing the replacement brushes and they function like the originals.
B002UQ7XQG|5|Hey everyone! I am a guy with medium long thick straight hair. Sorta like an emo/scene style and this product is great. My goal was to flat iron my hair so I could give it a more beachy look with different flips and curls. It looks way better. This mini flat iron is the perfect size and it doesn't feel cheap. It heats up pretty fast but its not the fastest. If you want a 30 second heat up, this mini is not for you. It takes like 1 minute to heat up. My brother has pretty curly hair and he has a mini flat iron like me, but not the same one. He has the Jose Eber petite flat iron which is even smaller than mine and heats up in 30 seconds. I highly recommend that one too. The croc however, I think, is better for thicker hair because it has a slightly bigger plate. You can grab a little more hair and if you run through your hair slowly it flattens it out and makes it really straight. Also, I like that this flat iron has spring plates which means it doesnt completely crush your hair. It adjusts to your hair. This is supposed to be healthier for your hair. One way to check if it has spring plates (I don't know what the plates are really called) is if you press down on the plates and it moves up into the iron. Remember to buy a thermal heat protector if you blow dry and flat iron your hair daily. Thats what i do with this iron and it makes my hair shinier than when i use the flat iron alone. It also protects your hair from heat damage and makes it look and feel healthier. If you have longer hair you shouldn't go for the mini flat irons.
B005FRB7F0|5|stinky but when mixed with cooking? Wonderful
B001DO0JYE|5|I have thin flyaway hair that also tends to get greasy really fast.  I used to pile different products one on top of the other to solve these problems and ending up getting greasy unmanageable hair that I had to wash every day.  This product solved all of my problems.  I use it on damp hair (2-3 pumps then massage over scalp) and my hair develops this bouncy, shapely, thick and manageable texture that I love.  It also keeps my roots from turning oily without drying out the ends.  I can also run wet hands through my hair to bring out the volume later in the day or the next day.  It's not sticky, it's not smelly - just fabulous!  Highly recommend...
B00AO73GSM|1|Not that good
B007K6K0IY|4|I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for #free in a #promotion #sponsored by #BzzAgent. I normally use aerosol sprays so I was eager to try this. I loved the sleek design package as well as the gel and how the product is dispensed through the small holes. It applies very nice and smooth. I think its great that it is clear and not white and chalky, nor does it leave the nasty white residue on your clothes like other products do. What I did not really like about it was the scent. I have no clue what it is! I would much prefer this in say a soft petal or lavender scent.  Overall its a nice product. I will buy again in the future, just in a different more pleasant scent.
B00QSHEM6C|5|This is from Burts new line.  No matter what your skin problem is, this is the best cleanser that Burt's has put out.  I have autoimmune disorder that causes mallar rash on face.  Only product (including burt's sensitive line) that clean's but yet leaves skin feeling great.  Small amount goes long way.  Last month purchased directly from Burts Bees because Amazon didn't sell yet.  Suggested that they do; they did start selling.  Next time will purchase from Amazon.  A little tip:  try and stay with all product's in the renewal line.  Lot easier.
B0009V8KG6|5|I've used this for at least 25(!) years. Have tried other removers, but always come back to this. not only is it gentle and effective, but it hydrates the area around your eyes. I love it.
B001AJ8YGC|5|I can't get over how quiet this thing is. I was previously using a braun micromesh electric. One that I bought on the cheap side something like 5 years ago. Needless to say, the Braun is in the trash.<br /><br />For the price, gentlemen, there is nothing better than this razor.
B00I6GAT7Y|5|much fresher version of daisy, but it's definitely not too far off from eau so fresh. I'd smell aound before buying both of these. I made a blind buy on this when I already have eau so fresh. And they're not too different. Still nice though.
B00PB48ZZM|5|omg this hair is soooo amazing 😍😍😍😍 , it curls very nice h<br />, has a nice texture it had no smell no gray hair !! i would defentially be buying this again  thankyou 😍
B005FKTDLW|5|works fine.
B0050HO9MI|5|I bought this razor even after reading all the bad reviews and have to say I am completely satisfied with it and will be ordering another.
B00BDTEAMG|5|Just what I needed.  Right fit!!
B00B588F12|5|I love it! it's great for dark spots, and makes your face look a lot younger and cleaner.
B004XA44NC|5|Great anti aging system. Can see a difference in skin after several weeks of using. I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction. I'm allergic to most products I have tried...great line. Will be ordering full sizes now
B00CB6R70W|5|love the smell
B00I9KPBTS|1|Smells terrrrrible
B003HG4GQI|4|It sharpens everything nicely. The only thing in my collection that had trouble were some high saturated lipglosses by urban decay. I think that is more Bc of the creamy glossy formula to them rather than the sharpener.
B008KSEZLO|5|I used this whitening gel with trays that I customized (also available on Amazon). It was easy to set up and apply each evening for the prescribed 30 minutes. There was no bad taste, no sensitivity problems, and it was not uncomfortable since the trays were molded to fit me (this also allowed for perfectly even coverage). I saw results immediately, and I love the way that I can decide on the brightness of my teeth! My dentist was going to charge me hundreds of dollars for a whitening treatment which he also warned me would cause sensitivity. This 'home remedy' is far better by every measure for me. I highly recommend this product.
B00PV15BPW|3|It doesn't seem as strong or smell the same as the peppermint essential oils I had been using.
B005DM0OHE|5|Have burn scars on both arms, these are great cover ups. Hold shape well and easy to wash. would recomend
B008OWGB68|5|smells heavenly
B0018715KS|1|Do not buy it  It is very poor quality
B00HXAIGM4|3|Not bad; I just don't like that it is slimy. I like the portability of it. Haven't seen any results yet but haven't used it long enough either.
B00K90JVG0|5|I am in love with this mascara..  As a make up artist and esthetician, I am always looking for something that not only I love, but can share with clients.  This product is fantastic!!!  There is a small learning curve but after that, wonderful results.  The company also resolved an issue quickly and very courteously.  Highly reccomend.
B00QI0O8VS|5|I was in love with these brushes as soon as I open the box. Not just because I received a bonus gift that made me feel like a princess as soon as I picked it up.<br /><br />The sponge brush I already love. It took it out of the package and I love the non latex material, and this is perfect for my foundation because of these star shape, & make it a million times easier to get around my eyeballs.<br /><br />Is a makeup junkie, I have a lot of brushes. You can never have too many, but it's easy to tell the good ones from the bad ones. I despise opening up a new package of brushes and having that weird chemical smell, and this package did not have that! So that's already two bonuses.<br /><br />The brushes are a synthetic hair, and each one is perfect in its handle. The I round brush is I think, probably my favorite. However, that being said I am going through an eyebrow phase! But I love the bristles on the eyebrow one because they are not as soft as the other brushes, they are a harder consistency, which is actually perfect for using on your eyebrows!<br /><br />The crease brush is really nice, the liquid liner brush I actually had to cut just a tiny little bit because it was a little frayed, but that so far is the only flaw that I see in this whole set which actually is not bad, especially considering the price!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this for carrying in your purse, or for me for some daily usage, & a couple in my purse for those emergency moments :-)<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.
B00FIJI8GG|4|Lovely and unique designs, but on the small side.
B009WUA658|2|mediocre clippers. not very sharp.
B00E4OQ63I|1|love it
