B0047VEE0U|3.0|I am sorry to say that this is quite a disappointment. Sure, the content of the box sounds satisfying, but it would have been so much better if the contents had actually varied from box to box. From reading other reviews, I am certain that both the film cells and the \\"signed\\" music sheet are identical in each one (as I also received the first page of \\"Detonators\\"). The musical sheet is not even a real musical sheet, just a photocopied one on GLOSSY paper. Still, had not the autograph also been photocopied, it would still have been acceptable. Now, it is just a piece of glossy paper that I could have printed myself.  Furthermore, the actual design of the box is poor. The CD's and the DVD does not stay in place when the box is closed, and albeit the sturdy packaging from Amazon, two of the three discs along with the booklet had fallen out of place. None was scratched, but the booklet was a bit dented.  On the other hand, the picture vinyl is gorgeous and the music itself sounds fantastic (especially when listening to the 5.1 mix on the DVD).  Overall, it's OK, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone but a real fan of the music.
0143116177|4.0|I enjoyed this book but it did leave me longing for more details. With such an immense subject no one could expect great detail in 350 pages but the author did a great job of summarizing such a vast subject and a coherent fashion. There are many critical reviews of this book but I acually enjoyed it for it's high level view. I'm a huge fan of economics and with the viewpoint from this very qualified author, I feel I learned a lot. In summary, I feel this book was well worth my time invested and it added a lot of perspective to the history of money.

B001BNFR6W|1.0|I was so excited to get this DVD collection for Christmas.  The first few DVD's played ok, but then after awhile, the DVD's start skipping and freezing to the point where every other episode cannot be watched.  I have tried them on 4 different DVD players, but each has similar results.  Very disappointing... I can't even watch the complete series... :(  Perhaps if you are looking to get the complete series, you should just invest in buying them season by season.
B003QCCS36|4.0|I like the entire premise of this album, from collaborating with the Pariah Dogs, to LaMontagne helming the production, to even that fantastic album art. It feels like a very cohesive effort, in much the same way that \\"Trouble\\" is, and yet for me, something is lacking here that the eclectic and moody previous albums had in spades.<br /><br />I'll use \\"Are We Really Through\\" as an example. In atmosphere and in composition, it closely resembles other profoundly beautiful songs in his repertoire like \\"Burn,\\" \\"Lesson Learned,\\" \\"A Falling Through.\\" Yet on this album it's a rarity. Most of the other songs are missing that indelible melodicism that so stamps LaMontagne's music as his and no one else's.<br /><br />The absolute standout track for me is the title track, and is one of my favorite songs this year. The lyrics are deceptively simple and unfailingly evocative, and the percussion moves up front in the most unobtrusive manner possible; the whole thing rolls along with an easy rhythm and the kind of flawless melody I've come to expect (perhaps demand?) from this brilliant modern troubadour.<br /><br />There's something haunting about \\"This Love is Over\\" - it evokes a damp day near a brickyard, no money in one's pockets - and I enjoy the jam session that bookends \\"Repo Man.\\" By contrast, \\"Beg, Steal or Borrow\\" just never goes anywhere, and the final two tracks contain a promise never fulfilled. \\"For the Summer\\" has a cool, contemporary groove that would do quite well on radio; \\"New York City's Killing Me\\" is too light to stick. I don't mind the steel guitar and the somewhat country bent of the tracks, because the music itself is still organic and honest, and LaMontagne seems even more comfortable stepping back in time to immerse himself in the inspiration of decades past.<br /><br />\\"God Willin' and the Creek Don't Rise\\" is a quality album; it's just missing some of the magic that I'd gotten used to, and the experimentation which defined his last two efforts. I'm not worried, though. It's Ray, and yes, I'm one of those fans that will gladly take whatever he has to offer.worried, though.

1934429376|4.0|This is a beautiful representation of Charley Harper's work.  It is a smaller version of the $200 version, but it is still a high quality, well bound edition.      Great for lovers of the artist on a budget.
B003EYVY04|1.0|After releasing years 1 and 2, which were everything a Harry Potter fan could hope for Warner Brothers really blew it with the new installments of year 3 and 4.  The number one feature that your average Harry Potter fan looked forward to was the extended edition of the movie.  This treasured feature is no where to be found in years 3 and 4.  And then the bonus features dvd could be used for target practice if you want to receive some enjoyment out of it.  If you have a gift receipt .... use it!  Warner Brothers is pulling down any negative reviews from their site and Amazon seems to be lumping all reviews of Prisoner of A. in to one category instead of by individual versions of the product, so when reading the reviews please make sure you are reading the reviews for the Ultimate Editions.
B0046UGSNS|2.0|I rented after all the \\"picture of the year\\" hype I heard about this movie.  My opinion is that I must be too socially conservative to feel uncomfortable by some of the scenes in this movie.  Just a warning to others who may feel like I did, the gratuitous gay porn movie (3 scenes with it, over done even for those it didn't bother) and the F bomb being dropped almost as much as in Scarface ruined an otherwise well acted movie about a very non-traditional family just truing to live their lives in a so called normal world.  (Do all lesbians swear this much??)  I think the casting and the acting were perfect for the movie.  The scene where Ann Benning is sitting around the dinner table with all the \\"family\\" and the film is slow motion to show her emotions at that time is acting perfection.  You can feel her emotions like they were happening to her.     I hate how movies these days feel the need to get the R rating to draw audiences when in fact the story could have stood by itself.  I wouldn't call this a comedy as it is billed.  I think of this as a complex family drama with a few dry humorous moments.  Not a comedy.  I'd have given this 3 stars instead of the 2 I did if it wasn't for the Howard Stern shock value of a handful of scenes and unnecessary language.  IMHO,not up to the hype.
006056251X|4.0|This is third installment in the popular Wallflower series by Kleypas (if I'm not mistaken, three of the four titles made it on the AAR Top 100 Reader's Fave list this year) and it doesn't disappoint for a good read. Lisa Kleypas writes one darn good romance- and she surely doesn't let you down in the bedroom. The sensuality rating is scorching in this one. But the romance is just OK.<br /><br />Sebastian is the wild, lustful, fun rake who agrees to an &quot;anvil wedding&quot; with shy, stuttering Evie. The arrangement is mutually beneficial. She needs a husband to escape her awful family that abuses her and would marry her off to a grotesque cousin to keep her inheritance. And he needs need a wealthy wife to support his rakish lifestyle. When she appears at his doorstep with an offer, despite having ever talked with him before, he readily accepts and whisks her off to Gretna Green for a wedding just days later.<br /><br />This romance lacks the bed wooing because the two waste no time consummating their marriage- of course to make it legit. We get to know the characters intimately long before we know them emotionally, and the pair could say the same about each other. I actually liked this plot device because it was fresh and original. (And realistic, I'm sure, for the time period.)<br /><br />Once back in London, the pair move into Evie's father's gambling hall to care for him as he lays dying. Soon, Sebastian inherits the gaming hall and takes it upon himself to run it and even improve it and finds a passion within his formally idle self that he never knew existed. The gaming hall and his sweet, new wife seem to give this rakish man a new perspective on priorities and he quickly changes his ways in order to win the heart of his orange haired, freckled beauty.<br /><br />Throw in a fiendish family, several murder attempts, one chaste bet to stay celibate and lots of kisses and bed play, and you have &quot;Devil in Winter.&quot;<br /><br />What this novel is missing the most is character development. If you don't carefully read the passages, you will miss the transformation in Sebastian and he will seem to go from rake (who, yes, calls his woman a &quot;bitch,&quot; OUCH) to poet, a man who begs his wife to make love. But worst of all, and what makes the story at all inferior, is that it's missing my favorite character... REGENCY ENGLAND. You will find that this is a two stage story. Besides the anvil wedding, the two stay within the walls of the gambling hall almost entirely. This novel could take place anywhere, and Society is null and void.<br /><br />That being said, Kleypas rarely lets you down. She knows how to write a good love scene, and there isn't a novel of hers not worth reading. I can't rate this one above three stars though, because it's missing such important elements that make a novel a keeper for me.<br /><br />Hmmm, and one last note.... what's the deal with the cover of this novel? I wonder what Lisa thinks of it? We see a large Victorian mansion, bay windows abound, sitting in a frozen countryside in the middle of no where. Though the story seems to take place in inner city London.g the most is character development.

B003EYVXXW|4.0|This was a fabulous movie!! Almost every hated, banned or controversial film seems to rank in the best ever made for some reason. This masterpiece is one of them. I liked the panorama of it, and methodology used in casting. The Director had me feeling like I was there witnessing the murder of Hypatia by the Christians. The Parabalani were ironically dressed in black, the color of Saturn, the previous Roman cult. That was an incredibly smart observation.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz gave a oscar worthy performance, as she made me feel she was channeling the philosopher. All the characters and groups were portrayed sympathetically, Theon shown as fallable.<br /><br />The savagery of the torture, murder should have been shown, and I can only hope Mel Gibson does a Passion of Hypatia to make up for this oversight.<br /><br />This film is nevertheless, brilliant, and should be seen by everyone to get a good sense of how the Dark Ages began. (Not sure how the US Censorship happened, fascist creep I guess). This Movie Classic was scheduled for wide theater release in the US for November 2009. It didn't happen.
1439152780|4.0|Kate Morton's The Distant Hours, a Gothic tale of buried family secrets, is very reminiscent of Diane Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.  Very reminiscent.  Right down to the eccentric twins, spooky castle, and literary plot agents.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as an evocative moody novel, is sometimes just the kind of book one craves.<br /><br />Morton's story begins as a long lost letter reveals a family back story that our opening narrator, Edie, could never have imagined.  At times hard to follow, the novel travels back and forth in time delivering the points of view of many of the main characters throughout the twentieth century.  Highlights are: Morton's use the evacuation of children from London during WWII, a fascinating historical moment; her deft use of an imagined literary mystery, and the kind of family drama that layers and anchors her characters.<br /><br />The Distant Hours is a rich and thick historically set treasure chest.

B003O85W3A|5.0|I held off on reviewing this album for a few weeks so that I could really get a grasp on it. I've been listening to Arcade Fire on and off for 5 years or so, but they never really resonated with me until I re-listened to all their albums within the last 6 months. This album, like all of theirs, took some time to grow on me, but it was worth the wait. Neon Bible still stands as my favorite overall album of theirs, but this one was fantastic. Sprawl II & Suburban War stand as my favorites on the album, but they are amongst so many other good ones. I mean, really, there's no songs I find myself consistently skipping when I listen through. Great album all around, although, as stated, it might take a few listens through in order to fully appreciate it.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|The toys from the Toy Story series are great. They draw you right in and I still love seeing them whenever I'm in Disney World. If you haven't seen this yet let me warn you that it is a tear jerker. Both my wife and I found ourselves crying at different parts but we both definitely cried at the end. I won't spoil anything but you will enjoy this movie :-)

B0025UHKNS|3.0|I researched this product before purchasing it for my wife.  I don't recall ever learning, in that research, that the heart rate monitor requires the user to wear a big nylon band with electrodes and a transmitter around their thorax.    That sort of negates the value of a very compact GPS unit that you can run with.  Why couldn't they design it so that it measures it through the wrist, where the unit itself is attached?  High-end electronic stationary bikes can measure the heart rate if you squeeze the conductive ends of the handlebars; that is, through the hand.  Why would Garmin expect runners, of all people, to wear a massive nylon band between their shirt and their chest, all the way around their chest?    One other quibble:  They've tried to approximate the iPod experience by making tactile controls, like a poor man's touch-screen.  But it's not the screen itself, it's the bezel.  To scroll through menu choices, you have to move your finger around the bezel, lightly touching it.  Half the time it doesn't work, and that's when you're indoors and stationary.  That will be a lot of fun when my wife is bounding along a road in 40 degree mist.    Other than that, it's OK; the GPS receiver works well, so far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've been looking for a good series for a while, and this book certainly quenched my literary thirst.  Best book I've seen in a while.  This well thought-out plot will leave you twisting and turning until the very end.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|When I first saw the commercials I was like, \\"Yes! Another Disney Princess flick!\\" I love it how Disney tries to make every little girl, no matter what race or background, into a princess, but making movies in which those girls can relate to. This movie was really cool, and I loved the music. I'd heard complaints that Prince Naveen was a typical white prince, and that now different racial little boys had to wait even longer for their role model. By the commercials I was skeptical of this 'outrage', and after seeing the movie I just shook my head at those people's stupidity. Naveen is in no way 'white', and when watching the previews I'd thought him as Middle Eastern. But besides this point I didn't agree with, I really, really enjoyed the movie. It's good to see a diversity in princesses forming.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I recently got a laptop with an HDMI port, so I decided to get this cable as well so that I could connect my laptop to the TV and watch shows and movies on the TV. Needless to say, it was well worth the small price. The cable is made of sturdy material that is obviously going to last a long time, and the video quality is just mind blowing with this cable. One of the best purchases I've made. Highly recommend it.
0792839749|4.0|My kids love this movie. Lots of music and songs. Even though my kids are french speaking, they love this english version. It is funny, full of surprises and they watch it over and over... Definitely a must have!
B003Y7L5W8|2.0|Very disappointed. These tracks sound more like album fillers and rejected B-sides than a whole new album. True, they regain the \\"sound\\" that characterizes them, but the music, the hooks, hell - even the LYRICS (not that they are worth THAT much to me) are simply not there. They should have reworked this album until the songs actually solidified. As they stand now, they are not worth more than a second or maybe third listen, just to confirm your first impression of the album was not wrong. Why won't they remaster their ENTIRE old catalog instead? That would have bought them more time and earned them extra money from royalties while they reworked these awful and corny tracks. I am VERY disappointed with this piece.
B003TSEL7S|2.0|i can't lie, I was dissapointed by this book. Percy Jackson was my guilty pleasure so I had to get this one. The new characters are pretty bland, and the one girl character annoyed me the whole time. Basically, I would say the book isnt really worth reading if you are used to any older-adult literature. I had to force myself to finish it!
B003PIUC02|1.0|While I enjoyed what I was able to view, (the first two discs), the third disc was defective and would not read in any blu-ray device I tried. This happened even on the replacement discs after amazon replaced the first set. I will say that Amazon has been quite responsive in replacing the disc but it looks like there is a bad production run on the third of four discs.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|The Lady Gaga Fame Monster was a big disappointment. Sound is flat, dull - I've played it on different systems & they're all the same - no depth, no all-surrounding sound. Tunes are good but sound is not of the quality I expected.

B003ZK58WM|4.0|It's a real shame this book is so ridiculously overpriced because it is quite wonderful. I am currently listening to it while I drive and I never want to get out of the car! Ken Follett's writing is as captivating as ever. You immediately get drawn into the story and become attached to certain characters. I never knew much about WWI but this novel had me looking up information about it because I had no idea what the world was like at that time. The amount of historical research utilized is astounding. The cultural aspect is also amazing. I love how Follett gives us a glimpse of other times and cultures you would never have experienced. You will not be disappointed. Unfortunately, there is no flippin' way I would pay $19.99 for a flippin' e-book! I don't care how good it is or who wrote it. Just get it from the library like I did. Sorry Mr. Follett. I would have loved to financially support your work because it is awesome, but 19.99 is WAY too much.

B00005QHV5|5.0|Having 15 sets of Beethoven symphonies, why on earth would I ever purchase another? I love my Karajan, Gardiner, Szell and Zinman sets ... so why would Wand have anything more to say. He recorded these in the late 1980's at the age of 75 after all. Surprise! Wand's performances have no ego ... simply the composer sounding upbeat and fresh. The SOUND is outstanding. Listen to the tympani ... every beat counts and perfectly. Each section is simply top-notch. No notes are lost by muddy recording. This set is a delightful surprise.  If one were coming to Beethoven for the first time, I recommend this set as the one to begin with ... and a bargain to boot. I'm going to buy a batch and give them to friends who have ears to hear.

0767830555|3.0|My thoughts on Seeing Taxi Driver,the film itself is complicated to explain,yes there is Intense Violence and you have someone who is not well,on the other hand You sort of have De Niro's Character and the Loneliness come through Raw and Gritty,I would call it a Gritty Street Film Not ART or A \\"Masterpiece\\",It certainly was not meant to Be Pleasant. Certainly Cannot Condone such behavior,I was skeptical because I thought maybe it was a Political Statement at the time on Guns and Violence as usual from a Hollywood Liberal Perspective,and it might be in a way in some sort of hidden meaning. It also just so happens De Niro is a Vietnam Vet in the movie or former marine so the Stigma and \\"Political Jab\\" may or may not be there for some including myself. I do not view it as a Classic but It is Eerie,And De Niro certainly pulled it off.
B002ZG980U|5.0|it's a puzzle that will require multiple views to get all the details straight. Lot's of fun to discuss with friends after it's over.    If you like the Matrix, you will likely enjoy this movie. If you don't like the Matrix you will likely still like this movie.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise. I'm always a bit wary of remakes, but when I saw that Jackie Chan w/b in it, I took the chance.  I was very impressed with Jaden Smith & all the hard work he put into this movie, with the help of Jackie Chan.  Very impressive. Nice to see Chan finally get the chance to show that he's about more than comedy action.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|I wasn't sure how much I would like this but I was looking for a decent comedy & based on reviews decided to check it out. Emma Stone was also a reason. I like this actress & her style of acting. She easily pulled off the character & I think she's part of the reason why the movie went so well. There are some laugh out loud moments but the story line is good as well. This isn't just one of those immature, gross humor kind of teen movies. Overall, this was a good movie, perfect for those times when you want something light and funny to watch.
B000055Y0Y|4.0|Excellent movie, great casting, great directing.   Mr. Petersen seems to have custom made the part for Mr. Eastwood, including his piano playing into the character. This makes for some lovely moments in the movie.   I think this is the last movie, to this date, in which Mr. Eastwood starred but did not direct himself. Mr. Petersen did an excellent job.   The extra material is quite interesting, too.
0452286751|3.0|*Includes some spoilers* This book can be divided into three parts:    The beginning, where Roark and Keating are introduced and their differences are quickly established. This is perhaps the most interesting part of the novel as it is the part most driven by plot and dialogue.    Then there is the middle, when the powers that be are impeding Roark's progress, which doesn't seem to affect him emotionally at all. This part is also still mainly driven by plot and dialogue but by this point the reader will most likely already be weary from all repetitive events of the story. Roark facing some sort of disappointment and Keating achieving increasingly greater status. This is mostly a repetition of events that portray Roark as a martyr. Other characters are developed including the main antagonist Ellsworth Toohey and the love interest Dominique Francon so this section is still somewhat interesting.    The end is the main problem of the novel. The closer the story draws to its conclusion the more philosophical it becomes and it goes from repetitive events to repetitive speech. The three main protagonists Roark, Dominique, and Gail Wynand are all essentially one character. That is, they all seem to share the exact same thoughts and ideas and they each talk about them in length multiple times. The reader basically ends up reading the exact same speech over and over again from three differenct characters whose interactions are especially painful to read. This leaves the antagonists, Keating and Toohey, as the most interesting characters of the novel because they are the most dynamic and rounded. This is significant because the author isn't just trying to make good heroes and villains but is trying to make a statement about individualism. The hero is an \\"ideal man' does not compromise his ideals while one villain is a sycophant who has no ideals, and the other is a master manipulator trying to supress the greatness of man. Even for someone who agrees with objectivism, or justa Libertarian or free-thinker, the character of Roark can still be unlikeable and obnoxious.     One wonders why the author even bothered to write a novel in the first place if it was just going to serve as a giant allegory for capitalism vs. socialism, right vs. left etc. It would've saved both the author and the reader a lot of time if she had just written an essay or a book about her philosophy. Her ideas are interesting and well thought out. She captures the essence of libertarianism and rational egoism better than any fiction writer and better than most philosophers and politicians ever have which leads you to wonder why she didn't just write some sort of essay or philosophy book instead of a massive, repetitive novel.    Technically, the author is not a bad writer. Her prose is well-structured and easy to read and the plot and dialogue are engaging at times, mainly during the beginning. The problem lies in her beating the issue to death and leaving the reader exhausted and annoyed by the end of the novel. A novel should not have to be satisfying as long as the reader doesn't read the last 1/3 of it. The uneven pace is also a major flaw. Most of the novel is medium-paced and major events spaced out by character interactions. However in the last 1/3 of the novel the pace fluctuates between extremely long, drawn-out speeches about from Roark/Dominique/Wynand and very fast action. The end where Roark destroys the building, is taken to trial, and is found not guilty happens at a more rushed pace with less detail than the events in the first 2/3 of the novel.

0062024329|3.0|I purchased this book as a gift for a friend because I have read the paperback edition and found it most enjoyable.  When I received this \\"graphic novel\\" it was like a comic book in hardcover.  I returned the book and got the paperback edition instead.  Please do not misunderstand, the story is very good but the format does not fit the story in my opinion.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I don't get all the negative reviews. I like this CD just fine. I think his voice is fine. I like some songs better than others but I feel that way with any album. There were so many negative reviews I almost didn't get it. What a mistake that would have been. I guess the negative reviews were from people that only like one style of music....their  loss really
B003VPWXRO|4.0|I must have liked this book, since I couldn't put it down, and when I did I couldn't wait to get back to it. Just one thing I didn't like was that Portia keeps repeating the almost the same scenarios during the times she was starving herself. I wonder if it is brave to have wrote this for the world to see. I love her as an actress and never knew she was anorexic and wonder if this is what almost all of hollywood women do to be thin and it is actually the norm for leading ladies?
B002VECM6S|5.0|When it comes to inspirational movies, it's always best to find the ones based on a true story; that way you're not just getting Hollywood-feel-good fluff.  \\"The Blindside\\" does an excellent job of telling an inspiring story while keeping away from common \\"cheesy\\" and cliche approaches.    The first minutes show that it's more than just the story of \\"Big Mike\\" by telling the purpose of the \\"blindside\\" and why the position came to be.  This is important exposition, because we come to find that this role is played out not only on the field, but in Mike's personal life, in the interaction of the family, and so forth.    The writing is excellent, as are the performances. There is so much happening with the story to keep you engaged throughout (much of the action takes place off the field, so it is not your token sports movie) and the actors keep the characters believable and relatable.    If you have not yet seen this, do yourself a favor and get it.  It is one you will watch more than once.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I saw Mumford and Sons at the 2010 Telluride Bluegrass Festival and immediately recognized their fresh invention,   artistic energy, and thoughtful lyrics. Since I purchased their CD \\"Sigh No More,\\"  I have played it daily, seeing greater depth of emotion and instrumental genius each time.  The haunting quality of the lead singer, the close and evocative harmonies, and the varieties of tone and rhythm signal the merit and promise of this young group.  I look forward to their future work. I recommend this CD highly.
B003L20ICE|5.0|I loved this movie, and after reading some of the negative reviews, think a lot of people got hung up by watching it as a social commentary. With gay marriage such a hot political topic right now, I guess it's hard not to do that, but I really think it wasn't written to be that way. It's not a soapbox movie. IMHO it's not trying to portray lesbian marriage any certain way, or lesbians themselves, or teenagers, or sperm donors etc. It's about 5 people. 5 individuals, with very distinct personalities, psychological baggage, desires and fears. Two happen to be gay, two happen to be teenagers, and one happens to be a straight male who's never married and once was a sperm donor.<br /><br />If anything, this film is about marriage and family apart from any of the individuals involved. Or rather, it's about the struggles most of us go through trying to make these things work. The unique back-stories and social milieu are part of the struggle for these particular individuals, but not the point of the story. So I don't think it's fair to judge whether these were 'real lesbians' (who gets to decide what that is anyway?) or 'real teenagers', or whether this presented gay marriage in a positive or negative light.<br /><br />I think the main reason I loved this movie though is that personally I was just carried along by the characters every step of the way. I believed every single one of them. I thought these 5 individuals put in fabulous performances, and that Annette Benning's was Oscar material. I also laughed out loud at points, so that's great, too. Well-written, well-acted and unique - a gem.

B001TKD4ZI|1.0|I was hoping for so much better after reading the many good reviews.  Possibly it was a question of timing.  I read this book right after finishing Queen of Shadows by Dianne Sylvan - which i found to be a truly fabulous story.  By comparison, How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire felt embarrassing to read.  Another reviewer used the word \\"cutesy\\" and that's probably quite apt.  And i agree with whoever made the point about the use of the phrase \\"God's blood\\" - I was reading on a my iTouch and at one point the term was used once per screen for several screens in a row!  Anyway, if you are in the mood for something campy and silly, this might be what you're looking for; the book does have a decentish pace with lots happening.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This was an incredibly fast read, but the ending or &#34;Great Reveal&#34; was quite dissappointing. For the most part the book was entertaining. Yes, I did roll my eyes at part of the premise, but it's fiction, so I kept reading. Despite what other reviewers may have said, there really is nothing negative about the Masons in the book. Brown constantly points out how misunderstood the Masons and their rituals can be.  Anyone claiming that Brown slanders (libels actually, since it is written) the Masons hasn't actually read the book.   The most unrealistic part of the book is towards the beginning where Langdon is lecturing to hundreds of students, yet is still able to have a discussion with them as if they were in a small classroom of 20.  Overall the book was fun to read, but the ending dissappoints.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have read all the Percy Jackson series & for a spin-off book it's great. I was disappointed when I had finished the series so for it to continue with new characters and new plots plus some old characters is great. I would recommend this book to anyone. Although you might not have to read the Percy Jackson series but I suggest you do, not only does it help with some background info on myths but it also helps you understand some characters in this book.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I was a big fan of the show, and liked the first movie. For me, the first half of this movie - while 'the girls' were still in NYC - worked. The story lines established there for each of them felt character-relevant and age-appropriate: Carrie - working to define a childfree new kind of marriage for herself and Big, Miranda - struggling with work/life balance and an authoritarian boss, Samantha - facing (or facing down) menopause, and Charlotte - dealing with the challenges of motherhood. The gay wedding scene was a little over the top for me, and many of the character comments too, but the show always had that over-the-top, slightly slapstick element at times, so I could let it slide.<br /><br />Once the girls went to Abu Dubai though, it was all downhill. Why, why, why? And who, who, who thought this was a good idea? The setting (and plot) were just too unreal, the girls got whiny and started feeling false, Carrie's meet-up with Aiden was beyond absurd, and some of the commentary on middle eastern culture, and especially the role of women, didn't ring true and made me squirm in discomfort. All in all, a very bad move. The movie could have just stayed in Manhattan and done fine. Oh well. I hope they try again, but this one was a three star at best.
0061440795|4.0|Great reading in a small package. The story is clear, direct, focused and nicely translated. One can easily do it in a day with no big efort but great satisfaction.  I haven't read the original in french, but this translation brings me back to the time it was written easily. And the text is timeless, the plot could've happened last summer as much as decades ago. What was \\"shocking\\" by the time it was written isn't that much today, but that doesn't lessen the plot absolutely. Even today it has many advices to the young and older also.  Enjoy this classic and this nice edition that also brings us some good extras on the author.

B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I love this cable and am so glad I paid the extra money for the audio. It has re-defined my life. I now can use my 32' Samsung HD TV as my Mac computer. Whereas some files may not play on the Xbox 360, you install VLC on your mac and get a hold of this plus a decent HDMI cable and you have the greatest multimedia device there is. Emulate old school video games on your big screen, or watch your digital movies on a screen much bigger than your iPhone. If you plug your Mac into a powersource, and have a wireless mouse and keyboard you don't even need to open the laptop is just lays flat as a slim lightweight hard drive. All in all this cable + HDMI + Nice TV + Mighty Mouse + Bluetooth keyboard = The Ultimate Entertainment Source. Don't forget to get VLC, a little open-source program capable of playing any video file!
0385342047|4.0|I read with amusement the negative reviews for this book, which mostly revolve around two main complaints  - 'the shopaholic story is tired' and 'Becky never learns'. Of course! This is a franchise! If you are tired of the premise and Becky, don't buy the book. You know what you are going to get - it's pretty much a fixed product.<br /><br />If you take it as such, and can suspend disbelief and give yourself over to it all, you can have fun. That's all I was looking for and this book delivered. Just don't take it too seriously, or expect too much of Becky, and you'll be fine.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|The original disc with all of its edge enhancement and plastic-looking skin tones was replaced this summer by Paramount.  They posted an address where you could send disc one of the original blu-ray. After waiting four months and sending a couple of emails the end result is I'm out the original blu-ray and never received the replacement disc.  I will avoid Paramount discs in the future as the way they handled this entire exercise was a mess.
0307266303|5.0|IF you are an avid runner, you must read this book.  It is an amazing insight into the reasons humans are the best runners on the planet...how our bodies were made to run.  I don't believe in the evolution part of it, but that doesn't impact the importance of the information.  I just believe we were made that way.
B0024F08RO|5.0|My rating is not about the quality of the show but merely its quality as a product. Playing through my Samsung Blu-ray player it looks the same as a Blu-ray quality movie. I loved this show, especially the first two seasons. While I would have to say this was the worst of the seasons it does bring a conclusion to this thrilling series and if your like me you need it in your collection. If your looking into buying this item than you probably want it, if you dont have any of the other seasons, look into getting season 1. It will blow your mind.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I grew up with Toy Story. Sure, this may be a bit dark for some 5 year olds, but the kids that were five when they watched the first one, aren't anymore, as reflected in the story, we're in college now. I had only one small complaint, apparently too small to remember, but besides that, it was perfect. I had a smile on my face so wide, for so long after walking out of the theatre. I wanted to live in the world of toy story, it reminded me of my youth, it reminded me how much things have changed, how much I've changed. But you're never too old to be a kid again. You're never too old for Toy Story.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I thought it was going to be difficult to like this new version, since I'm a Karate Kid fan (the original one I mean) but, sorry Ralph Macchio but Jaden Smith rocks!!!

B001DZLAWI|3.0|the problem is not the content on the album.the problem was the product itself. record # 1 came warped. both records had melted vinyl around the center hole on side 1&2. and the gatefold cover was made from flimsy cardboard without any finish to it at all. if i wasnt so lazy i would have definitely sent it back.just seemed mass produced at a very high speed, like no care was taken at all.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I really liked this movie, and my husband actually watched the whole movie also. The movie is still a chick flick, but it was a good date night movie.     The movie was better then that last two I think.  It's not a snoozer that's for sure.

0525423273|5.0|I'm a nerdfighter (nerdfighters.com) and when I heard one of the spokesmen for our glorious Nerdfighteria speak on how a fellow nerdfighter had published an incredible book, I scurried off to Barnes and Noble with my gift card and purchased the novel. And it was made of awesome; sweet, sweet awesome. The characters of St. Clair and Anna are perfectly, slowly developed with rich histories that are complex enough to make them feel authentic without burdening the ease of their conversations or boggling down the plot, which is perfect in itself. Two eighteen year-olds in Paris discovering themselves and the most romantic city in the world attend the elite School of America in Paris. Anna bids her home of Atlanta goodbye against her will but soon falls in love with the city, her new-found independence and the beautiful, short St. Clair. Through out the twists and turns of the novel, you genuinely want them to end up together regardless of their circumstances, and Perkins writes an ending so eloquent that all will be satisfied. Funny and flawlessly conjured, j'espere que vous acheterez ce livre! DFTBA.
B000XXGMS8|4.0|This boot was good, but I wish the sizes were truer. It takes a lot of time to ship and return. I have read that they were bigger than true sizes, but it was hard to estimate how much. Perhaps Amazon should consider using a 'Timberland' scale versus its own. :-)

B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is by far one of the most original films in recent years. A great action film, it also provides a strong metaphor for film making. What makes the film great are the strong performances by Leo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy,Marion Cotillard  Ellen Page, Dileep Rao and Ken Watanabe and the spectacular visuals. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a master extractor - a specialist in stealing information from target's dreams. Cobb assembles a team in order to perform inception - influenced inspiration on a subconscious level - so that he can have criminal charges placed against him lifted and return home to his family. While the plot requires a large amount or suspension of disbelief, it is handled in a brilliantly realistic manner. The Bluray includes a number of entertaining extras for people who like learning more about the behind the scenes process. This movie should be considered one of the new \\"classics\\" and is definitely worth the purchase.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|This series is without doubt the most fast pased action Vampire entertainment thus far.  This is like 24 meets the Twilight Saga.  Much more happens in this series at such a fast pace.  If you start to wtch you will be glued to the story and turning events.  In addtion to Vampires new myth identies are introduced such as: Witches, Warlocks, Compulsed Humans (Zombie like Tranced), Werewolves.  All belended into a modern day young adult setting.  I recommend anyone to watch it from the beginning of the series.
0698400852|5.0|Why is it so darn hard to find this story unabridged??<br /><br />Is it really so hard to understand or keep kids attention these days??<br /><br />To me, if you are going to bother reading a classic, read the whole thing as the author wrote it.  Otherwise you are reading someone else's work.<br /><br />This book is not only the full story, it is beautifully illustrated.  It is a wonderful edition and one that will be an heirloom, remembered by little ones when they are grown up and reading it to their little ones.<br /><br />I looked far and wide for an edition that was unabridged and lovely enough to come out every Christmas and this is absolutely the one and I'm so happy to have it!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This movie is the best version of P&P there is. The cast, setting, direction, costume, script, every aspect of this film is brilliant!<br />The wit and humor from the novel come to life on screen with the very talented actors. Lizzy, Darcy, Mr. & Mrs. Bennet, and Mr. Collins are perfectly cast. The rest of the cast is absolutely delightful too, but the ones I mentioned really stand because of their superb acting, humor, or both.<br />The locations used in the movie are beautifully chosen as are the songs for the soundtrack.  This is by far the the most all around high quality movie I can think of.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Figure when Hanks and Spielberg do a project together it's going to be good, and Band of Brothers is very, very good. This is realistic, well acted, and keeps your interest through the whole series. I highly recommend this series. If I were a high school civics or history teacher, I would show this to my students every year.
0439023513|1.0|At least that's what I got out of it. She shows you a dystopia where propaganda is spewed, recognized and bitterly swallowed by her characters. With this book she's the creator of equally distasteful propaganda that her readers had to do the same with. War is bad. I challenge her to find a person who has lived through it to prove her wrong. But that same person will tell you of the hope as well as the despair that was felt in those worst moments. The source being human connection. And that's the part that Collins has revealed herself incapable of grasping in the end. Or blinded by motive.    Peeta was that hope and salvation for me. I compare him to the remaining grain of sand, of Fantasia, that the empress holds out to Bastian in The Neverending Story. With virtually everything gone and broken there still remains the simplest of foundations to build upon whether they be tangible or the shattered will of a young girl tired of living her life in perpetual survival mode. Instead Peeta and the rest of the characters are patsies in Collins's goal, much like they were in Coin's.     The absence of the emotional was painful. Had she allowed her characters to develop in this direction the rest would have written itself without discounting the ugly side of war and human nature. I enjoyed the twists and even the futile mission idea but they would have served a better purpose had she kept her characters engaged rather then mere observers or victims of carnage. There were multiple missed opportunities to overlay earlier more naive perceptions of Katniss's with new more mature ones and show her reconcile these.     ***Small spoiler*** The scene where Katniss rhythmically smooths the pearl against her lips was lovely but relegated to only a glimpse of what this book could have been.     Hate to be obscene but this book was like an abortion. Nurtured, even pampered, during the first stages to only be ripped from the womb and callously discarded. It makes you wish you never even read the other 2 books in the first place.     Collins left me feeling \\"Why should I care if she certainly doesn't\\" and this, I can't forgive, no matter how noble she thought her message was.
B0011Z31V8|1.0|This cd is for a NONE Prince fan. The record company just trying to fool the public. If you are a true fan you already have his music. This leaves out so much. A\\"Very Best of....\\" would be a triple cd. or more. Don't waste your money .
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The very first disc of this season's 5 series will grab you. I was sitting on the  edge of my seat the whole show. I found it interesting and challenging because   this series relects actual events from the bible. I loved that I actually knew  some of the prayers that were said, it made me think of events that are  fore told,it made me interactive with this show. I am no scholar but, it was   thrilling for any show to actually cover this topic. I am a fan  of the entire show Supernatural, at first season 1 was hard for   me to get into, but the actors, the writers and the show itself   matured. Better writing, it just pulls you in. At the end of 5th   season, I found myself up for hours thinking of the ending, actually  hard time to sleep, could not shut off my brain. I thought, ok, I am  good with this ending. Not really, but I can accept it. Then the   next day, I found out there is season 6. OMG!!!!! I can't wait,   where are they going next?
1401322425|5.0|I have to say that before this series on Food Network I was not a huge fan of Jamie Oliver's. But the simple setting and focus on the garden really caught my attention, and it was one of the only shows that I watched every week. I bought the book this summer and I have to say that it has been a pleasure to read. The binding and pages are high quality. There are beautiful pictures of Jamie's garden through the book, as well as growing tips for each of the vegetables. He also shares his viewpoints on factory farming, and eating organic local food. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to garden and cook, and those who like to read cookbooks. The recipes are simple and straightforward, and are meant to highlight the vegetables.
B001FXW0W2|5.0|Probably not the first time that word has been associated with Amelie -- infectious.  My wife bought it.  From the cover, it seemed to me like a 3-snore chick-flick.  Boy, was I wrong.  Beautiful; like a series of stylized abstract paintings. Clever. Relentlessly optimistic. Perfect cast. But, mostly, one of the truly original/creative movies I have ever seen.  From reluctant chick-flicker to -- Amelie is now in my top 5. I have a crush on Audrey Tautou and I can't even pronounce her name.   This movie is even good the second and third time. And [spoiler alert] it did wonders for gnomic yard ornaments.  Just see it.  One a nicely-sized HD screen.  Hint: Amelie is quite possibly the greatest first-date flick in the history of mankind.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Great deal for all three movies, digital copies and blu-rays. If your looking to add this collection, it's a must have.
1878424505|3.0|If you can get through the \\"there is no God - we are all God, there is no Hell - we live in Hell on earth, and there is no Heaven - we CAN have heaven on earth by following the 4 agreements\\" mumbo-jumbo, the actual 4 agreements are good rules to live by.      I only start the review that way because for completely unprovable positions mentioned above, the author certainly takes an authoritative stance.      It is a very quick read with some good techniques that could be applied to improve anyone's life.  I read in in about an hour without putting it down.  I would have given it more stars, but the author chose to base everything around is \\"we are all Gods\\" theory, and even through in some corny prayers at the end.      The bottom line is this: at the end of our lives, there will be a truth.  Until then, the author would be best served sticking to the four agreements - they are pretty applicable.
B00427X9WI|5.0|This is one of the most profound movies I have ever seen. It seemed to resonate with my Soul!!! The travel,settings,the music and cast were exceptional. The messages were very powerful. It is a funny yet  inspirational movie!!!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Thinking that it's probably another sequel that doesn't match up to the original. I was wrong; I thought Iron Man 2 was better, a more likable and entertaining film than the first! Of course, it helps to know in advance that the \\"hero\\" (\\"Ton Stark,\\" played by Robert Downey) is even more obnoxious in this film. Knowing that, I didn't let that bother me and just enjoyed the good acting in here and the excellent special-effects.     Mickey Rourke (\\"Ivan Vanko\\") is almost always interesting to watch so I enjoyed his role, too, even if I had a hard time understanding his Russian accent.    The story is, yes, sophomoric but most action films today are. Just enjoy the funny lines, CGI, the pretty women (Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johannson) and wild heroes and villains and you should get your money's worth out of the viewing. See it on Blu-Ray and you'll enjoy it that much more.
B001UV4XFG|2.0|I was very disappointed with this movie. It seemed like they just threw it together to get it out on the market sooner.  The quality of acting seemed to go downhill too, all the actors seemed bored.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I started using this headset with my PS3 and I loved it. All my friends have the Astros or other high-end headset, and I have tried them all. I must say that on the PS3 that these are just as good as any high-end headset on the market. Very easy to connect and setup, and works great. The one disadvantage is the cords that run from the system to my couch (will happen with any good headset on the market).    Now for the XBOX360, this headset is sub-par. Just getting the headset to connect to the XBOX360s was a pain. I had to order a special adapter off amazon ($7) to get it to connect and still use HDMI for video. After that trouble, it isn't so bad. However, the sound is better on the PS3 than it is on the XBOX.    Overall on the PS3 I give this headset a 9/10, but for the XBOX360s I give it a 6/10. Overall, about 4 stars.

B003VB5E2E|5.0|This is another Crossroads \\"winner.\\" All three of them have offered a lot of great moments and this latest one does, too.<br /><br />Yes, it has a number of the same artists from the 2007 Crossroads concert, also held in Chicago, but some of them are better in this one, and some of the \\"newcomers\\" really shine. All in all, it more than balances out and gives you four hours of very good stuff.<br /><br />Who's good and who's bad is subjective, depending on which artists you like, but almost everyone I've talked to agrees the \\"jam sessions\\" are the best in this 2010 festival.<br /><br />The groups of Buddy Guy-Jonny Lang-Ronnie Wood; Derek Trucks-Susan Tedeschi-Warren Haynes; B.B. King-Eric Clapton-Jimmie Vaughan-Robert Cray and the amazing contingent of Vince Gill-Keb Mo-James Burton-Albert Lee-Earl Klugh-Sheryl Crow are all so good it can bring tears to your eyes and a lot of life to your toe-tapping feet.<br /><br />Those \\"sessions\\" alone make this concert well worth adding to your collection of music DVDs. The sharp Blu-Ray transfer doesn't hurt, either!
B004498KPU|3.0|The product does not show all videos in the HDMI format that it claims it was formatted for.  Although you see about 3 of them in that format the rest look like they came directly from VHS.
B003OFHMKO|1.0|I have been an Esperanza fan since her first release a few years ago...and was eager to see what her next contribution would be. Needless to say, it is no where near the mark of her previous release.  There was very little creativity in the song choice, no lyrics worthy of remembrance, and the continous moans made me wish someone would hand her a Pepto Bismol.  I know she is capable of a much higher standard in delivery.  I am sorry she chose not to meet that standard in this release.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|My family and I love this movie.  As we are watching we are often able to point out things a character will do that reminds of us of one of our own family members.  We haven't finished watching the DVD first season completely, but so far very enjoyable.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Well, this lived up to the hype, which wasn't an easy accomplishment. Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment. Thankfully, it didn't happen. In fact, it looks like they saved the best for last.    With a bunch of reviews already here, there is no sense going into the story. For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes.      Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places. This is a \\"must\\" for Blu-Ray.    Finally, what's really cool, too, is that the people who voice the main characters are still the same men and women who did the first two films, with the exception of Jim Varney (\\"Slinky Dog\\"), who died in 2000. It's great to still hear familiar and distinctive voices, such as those of Wallace Shawn (\\"Rex\\"), John Ratenzenber (\\"Hamm\\"), Don Rickles and Estelle Harris (\\"Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, respectively).    Kudos to all those involved in making this film. They nailed the essence of \\"Toy Story\\" and how much loyalty can mean.
0061743526|5.0|A gift for my husband.  We have only ever watched the movie and love it.  Recently, at a parent teacher conference, the teacher advised the class will begin reading it.  She advised the book is a lot more than the movie.  My husband and I thought it would be cool to read the book as my son's class was reading it.  This book was chosen because of the hardcover.  Also, because it's the 50th anniversary edition.

B0006AAS5G|3.0|You probably read that some models do not have tachymeter function, while others have.  After reading the reviews and doing research on the web, here how to differentiate between the old vs new version of 9211.  I believe it is correct, but not guaranteed.<br /><br />The old version of 9211 uses Miyota OS20 movement.  This is the movement with true tachymeter function.  The large second hand is used only for chronograph function.  The small second subdial at 6 o'clock is used for counting seconds.  You can tell the difference on the dial.  The subdials are closer together.  There are room for small index at 3, 6, 9 o'clock, just outside the subdials.  The stock photo used by Amazon is a photo of the old version.<br /><br />The new version of 9211 uses a different movement.  As far as I can tell, it does not match any of the Miyota movement.  It is very similar to JS20, except JS20 has 30 minute total counter while 9211 has 60 minutes.  The large second hand is used for normal second counting.  The subdial at 6 o'clock is used for timing.  The tachymeter is not usable.  So this really defeats the purpose of the 9211 bevel design.  With this new movement, the subdials are further apart and are closer to the dial's edges.  There are no room between the subdial and the dial's corner.  So there are no index at 3, 6, 9 o'clock.<br /><br />If you look on eBay where the actual watch photos are posted, you can differentiate between the 2 types.  Look to see whether small index (indices) exist at 3, 6, or 9 o'clock positions.  Old 9211 model with tachymeter function has these indices.  New 9211 model does not have these indices.<br /><br />Miyota OS20 is a very common movement used in chronographs.  You can search for videos on this movement.  When you reset the chronograph after using it, the second hand will flyback to the 12 o'clock zero position in 1 rotation.  On the new 9211, the second and minute hands will wind backwards (at a high speed) to the zero position.  It is not just single rotation, it will rotate as many turns as the timer was used.  So if you had the timer running for 10 minutes (10 rotations), it will take couple minutes for the timer to wind around and around and around (10 turns in high speed) back to zero.  It is pretty weird and interesting to watch, but really defeats the use of timer feature.<br /><br />I purchase 9211 from Amazon in Nov 2010.  I was hoping I would get lucky and get the old version.  No such luck.  I didn't keep the watch as I wanted the chronograph/tachymeter function, which is how the watch was designed originally.<br /><br />Here is my take of the watch.  The watch is decent, but you get what you pay for.  Invicta cut some corners with this watch, as you can tell by the actual sale price.  Where did they cut corners?  (1) Movement.  Described above.  (2) It does not have solid end links.  The last link, where the bracelet is connected to the lugs by pins, is made of rolled metal piece, rather than solid piece.  (3) The buckle or clasp is thin.  (4) The crown is really flimsy. On other watch with screw down feature, I can feel the screw down engage.  On the 9211, it is spongy and I cannot feel the screw down engage at all.  I suspect this can easily cause cross threading.  Or maybe the unit I got was already cross threaded.<br /><br />On the positive, the watch case and bracelet links are solid.  The watch and bracelet weigh 155g.  Solid and hefty.<br /><br />Also, the watch size can be a bit small for some.  This really on your preference.  But I will provide the detailed measurements here.  The case measures 39.5mm without the crown; this is not large by today's standard.  With crown, it measures 42.5mm.  And because the watch has wide bezel taken up by tachymeter marking, the crystal and dial only measures 30.5mm in diameter.  Because of the small crystal/dial size, 9211 appears smaller than it's almost 40mm case would suggest.l rotate as many turns as the timer was used.

B002ZG99NG|5.0|The Town is one of the most satisfying and enjoyable movie experiences I have had in a long time. The movie is part heist movie, part action, and part drama. Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm specifically are great and the whole cast does a solid job. The three robbery scenes are worth the price alone. The Town is also quite funny and is never ever boring. The Town balances being a fun flick and being smart. The action in The Town is not Transformers type action. I cannot imagine anyone not enjoying The Town. The Town delivers a terrific product that is much better than I ever expected and is so much fun to watch.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian's hardcore workout style is not absent from this DVD either. Granted, I am 5'5 and weigh 230 pounds which of course makes things difficult, but this is a great challenge with much greater results.    This DVD is divided into 3 workouts and there really isn't a timeline of when to hit the next level within the 30 days so naturally, one would move on once they feel ready to do so.    I have been doing this continually for about a week now and I already notice subtle differences in my body. I haven't seen any results on the scale, but I have more energy during the day and my clothes (especially jeans) are getting a bit loose.    Even if you are in good shape, Jillian suggests that you start at level one and then progress on because it IS that difficult. The first time I try a new workout DVD, I always watch it in its entirety and I noticed that even the participants who are in excellent shape were suffering. In fact, in one of the workouts she even embarrasses one of them because they didn't move quickly enough.     You do cardio, strength, and abs and the only rest you get is switching between exercises. You have the option of using dumbells. All of the workouts about 20 minuets long. Honestly, I think you get the most for your time by continuously working out for a short period of time without any breaks. This workout incorporates interval training which is a great way to lose inches while building muscle. She does give you the option of modifying some of the movements, but those are mostly strength workouts.     The only con I can think of is that this is not the DVD for you if you have joint problems because you'll be doing a lot of jumping around which can be troublesome for the knees and feet. Also, you do a lot of push up/plank exercises which can be a killer on your wrists.     I would recommend taking your body measurements BEFORE starting this because it can be a great way to see results if the scale isn't doing you any favors.    Overall, I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a challenge and is looking to work their body in its entirety.

1400079144|1.0|This book has none (I repeat, NONE) of the qualities that made _Angels and Demons_ and _The DaVinci Code_ so good.  The plot of _The Lost Symbol_ is just patently absurd.<br /><br />For all of Brown's blathering about the Masons, this supposedly \\"secret\\" society has the worst-kept secrets in the world. The ritual Mr. Brown elects to describe at the beginning of _The Lost Symbol_ can be found nearly verbatim at any public library in the country (or on-line for that matter -- in fact, you can purchase it from the United Grand Lodge of England)...  Brown just hasn't done his research very well. This scene has so many factual errors that it's almost comical (I've been a Freemason for nearly 30 years so I should know!).<br /><br />I asked one of my friends who is a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Mason (yes, the 33rd degree ONLY exists in the Scottish Rite) about the scene involving watching the Solomon video that is supposed to provide the \\"national security crisis\\" that necessitates the CIA's involvement in the story.  There is no \\"fifth libation\\" in the Scottish Rite (its a part of the Order of the Temple in the Knights Templar -- part of the York Rite -- a totally separate group!).  Brown could've asked any of about 10 million different people or gone to any public library to find this out...but he didn't.  For an effort that took 5 years of research, this is really inexcusable...<br /><br />The character of Katherine Solomon is just there to provide screams in the right places.  And what does Noetic Science have to do with ANY of this anyway?  None of this is ever fully developed.  The Robert Langdon that appears in this book serves mainly as a telegraph that something is important.  There's no character development at all -- just psycho-babble about pseudo-history and global conspiracies.<br /><br />In a story like this, it's the bad guy that drives it...  The bad guy in this one is just not very believable (even with the plot twist at the end that's supposed to wrap the bad guy's story up and expose his motivation).  It's reminiscent of the the story of the Joker (Batman's arch-nemesis)...except, as we have seen, the Joker is a far more interesting character with a far more complex psychological make-up than the villain of _The Lost Symbol_ is given.<br /><br />The chase is ridiculous...and toward the end, it devolves into a lot of mumbo-jumbo that sounds like Latin phrases and funny names and mystical chanting just strung together for effect.  Let's hope Ron Howard makes a far more interesting movie than this book was for me.  He'll need a VERY GOOD script writer in order for the film version of _The Lost Symbol_ to be anything more than a 21st-century version of the Keystone Kops (does ANYONE think the CIA is as inept as portrayed here?) with dark, foreboding music and Langdon's moronic (italicized) dramatic asides thrown in for effect.<br /><br />_The Lost Symbol_ is formulaic pap that wasn't very entertaining.

006145205X|3.0|Without a specific account of rationality, Ridley's use of \\"rational\\" seems to mean \\"has reasons based on good evidence\\".     This book does offer substantial evidence for Ridley's unflinching optimism. The work is not badly written, although sentences often contain excess verbiage. And what Ridley seeks to convey could be done in much less space. The thesis is simple enough. It is based on a firm belief that human ingenuity is inexhaustible.    For readers who hunger for hope, this book will not disappoint.     For readers who are more agnostic as to whether Ridley's optimism is indeed rational, some may be convinced that it is. At the very least, it is rational in the sense that Ridley seems to intend.     More critical readers will find themselves wondering whether Ridley's view is one of rational optimism or if these are merely rationalizations of an optimist. I tend toward the latter. Even if human ingenuity is an inexhaustible resource, ought it not be considered that human stupidity is as well?

B0028IDXDS|4.0|The Petite Consumer's review:<br /><br />The Wubbanub is a super cute Soothie silicone pacifier that is attached permanently to  a special weighted stuffed animal in a variety of styles. The stuffed animal prevents the pacifier from rolling away, makes it easier for a baby to grasp and manipulate, and helps keep the pacifier in the mouth.<br /><br />Coos<br /><br />BPA, PVC and Phthalate Free.<br />Uses a Soothie which is a medical grade, latex free pacifier.<br />Prevents the pacifier from rolling away from the child (and possibly less screaming from baby).<br />Plushie may help soothe baby due to the way it \\"cuddles\\" baby.<br />Plushie allows babies to grasp and manipulate pacifier themselves.<br />Lots of cute animal plushies to choose (Ilana's son had the dog...we think it is really cute).<br />Perfect for a baby with low tone and other mouth issues (Ilana's son was unable to keep a pacifier in his mouth due to weak muscle tone. The Wubbanub allowed him to push the pacifier back in his mouth).<br />Used by NICUs and hospitals.<br />Can be put in the washing machine to clean (...and you will need to).<br />Plushie is secured safely to the pacifier to prevent accidental removal.<br /><br />Boos<br /><br />While the Wubbanub can be washed the pacifier can not be sterilized (due to the way it is attached).<br />The only pacifier that is used is the Soothie. If your child already prefers a different kind of pacifier it may be difficult to switch.<br />Due to its plush design, it is not safe for use in the crib per experts (we do not recommend using it in the crib and to use a \\"plain\\" Soothie for sleep time).<br />If the baby becomes attached to the animal it may take you longer to wean off the pacifier (Ilana solved this problem by detaching the pacifier with some creative scissor work).<br />Dogs love to eat them (Ilana lost two to her dog...amongst other things).<br /><br />The Petite Consumer says: A \\"lovey\\" and a paci combo sounds like a baby's and parent's dream.  A great shower gift too.

B003B96AOW|4.0|I got mine today at the local Comics n Stuff store.  It's nice and big, around 7-8\\" tall and very sturdily built.  Comes with two long swords, two sais, two pistols and one rifle.  The base is big and heavy, and very nice.  the scuplting is nice and the paint is detailed.  My only problem is the articulation.<br /><br />His head spins around but does not move up and down.  His arms only bend half way at the elbows.  There is no articulation at his hips, so his legs are always at the same angle (but plenty of articulation at the knees, fortunately).<br /><br />Very sturdily built and still a great figure over all.  Taller and much bulkier than the Hasboro figures that just came out a month or so earlier (those are very skinny and have very small feet, which make it more difficult to stand, this one has bigger feet).

0060557818|4.0|A friend recommended Neil Gaiman's work to me, and I guess I've had my head in the sand, because I'd hadn't come across his name or works before.  Neverwhere was the first of his books I read, and now I'm a real fan.  It's a dark tale; a journey that opens your mind to the stuff of myths and nightmares.  This is not a fast-paced thriller. It's more like a map that unfolds.  You follow the highway before you, not knowing where it's going, but not minding the journey because it's so intriging.  If you haven't read his books before, don't let the discouraging reviews stop you.  Gaiman has a unique voice, and this is is truly a peculiar tale.  The characters live in a parallel world that is a bit of Dickens, and a dash of Gollem. Neverwhere is a place all it's own.

B003YBNRHU|5.0|You know how it is when you want your favorite band to do well and you excuse their poor to mediocre offerings? That's not the case with the Doobie Brothers' \\"World Gone Crazy.\\" I cannot believe how great is this album! This is not a CD of retro '70s music. This is a band that argues their passion for music is as strong as ever and still relevant. It's been my CD of choice since October, as I listen to it daily during my short commute to work. The old Doobies' magic has returned with Ted Templeman returning to assist as producer. Tom Johnston makes a statement about making rock 'n rock for 30+ years with the song \\"Young Man's Game\\" in which he boasts \\"I'll tell ya what don't work for me / the crazy ideology /that says playin' rock 'n' rock is just a young man's game.\\" The Doobies plead their case well that their band, with 30+ plus years of touring, is not merely a nostalgia act, but a band determined to make relevant music. They dusted off and reworked \\"Nobody\\" from their self-titled debut album from almost 40 years ago and made it richer with layers of terrific guitar work and strong harmonies. I still wonder why this is not a huge hit on the charts. You will find influences from gospel, Calypso, country, southern rock, blues, R&B, jazz/rock, and latin music on this CD, yet none of it seems out of place. You will find yourself aloud to choruses from \\"A Brigher Day\\". \\"World Gone Crazy\\", and \\"My Baby\\", as well as the songs I've already mentioned. Songs like \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" with Michael McDonald on background vocals and \\"Far From Home\\" should be on the rotation for soft rock stations. \\"Old Juarez\\" reminds me of work by Carlos Santana. The only song that doesn't work for me is the Patrick Simmons-Willie Nelson duet in \\"I Know We Won.\\" I realize Nelson's vocal don't follow the usual rules, but it really seemed mismatched with Simmons here. However, other reviewers seem to think it's a highlight. Maybe that's what makes this CD work--there are songs anyone would enjoy and listen to over and over. Finally, I ask the question, \\"Why aren't the Doobie Brothers in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame?\\" Millions of albums sold, numerous Grammys, obviously influencial, ability to play multiple genres, obligatory inclusion of their music in soundtrack for movies about the '70s, and musicians looking to capture new audiences of young listeners. Vote them in!

B001H5X7JS|5.0|Tropic Thunder is pure comic genius.  I can see how some people might find it offensive, but you know, sometimes comedy is offensive.  The film is satire of the highest order, and in some ways, is actually a multi-layered, nuanced, comic look at the entire film industry and world of film makers. Admittedly, the subtlety is easy to miss with the cheap, exploitative humor thrown in every 15 seconds or so.     What is truly funny is the bonus feature of \\"Rain of Madness\\", which is a fake documentary (mockumentary) on the making of the film Tropic Thunder (as if the film were actually being made by Tugg Speedman, Kirk Lazarus, Damien Cockburn, etc.).  The mockumentary is a perfect send-up of the real-life documentary \\"Heart of Darkness\\" about the making of \\"Apocalypse Now\\", only it is told as if directed by a Werner Herzog type film maker.  If you are familiar with Herzog's work, and listened to his riveting movie commentaries, you will appreciate how hilarious the mockumentary \\"Rain of Madness\\" really is.  Brilliant stuff, and accredited to actor Steve Coogan (who played the director in Tropic Thunder), and the co-writer of the film, Justin Theroux. Rain of Madness deserves to be seen by everyone who enjoys satire, but it really helps if you've seen Herzog's \\"Grizzly Man\\", or perhaps seen \\"Fitzcarraldo\\" or \\"Aguirre, The Wrath of God\\" beforehand. Priceless.

0393068382|4.0|All those studies that say that women are bad at math and men are bad at relationships because their brains are hardwired that way can be very discouraging, and there are a LOT of those studies. But Cordelia Fine has looked into those studies and found flaws in them. Add into that a large number of studies that show how easy it is to jigger people's minds into doing better or worse at tasks depending on how they are psychologically primed before hand and we can see where the author is coming from.<br /><br />Fine's thesis is rather than there being any physical difference between male and female brains, the differences that we see in math scores are there because our culture expects them to be there. Even when people attempt to raise their children in a gender neutral environment, culture intervenes. On TV, in schools, in children's books, in the clothing sold to children- everything is divided into genders, and females end up less adventuresome, more nurturing, expected to be nicer and not fight, and to focus on home and caring rather than invented and discovering. Toys for girls and boys are separated, and children who choose to play with toys for the opposite gender are disapproved of, especially boys who play with dolls or other `girl' toys. Tomboys may be told to act more ladylike, but boys will get beat up by other boys.<br /><br />The core of her argument is that studies where test takers are primed to consider themselves members of sets other than gender yield different results than tests taken when the test takers are told things like \\"men traditionally do better on this test\\". For instance, when a group of males and females take a test and are told before hand that people who go to certain colleges (colleges that some of the test takers go to) do better on this same test, the test takers conform to this and the males and females who belong to the colleges mentioned both do better on the test than the non-certain collegians- and the males and females in that group score the same as each other on the test under these conditions. These tests have been done numerous times by different researchers, and the results are always the same- the test takers conform to expectations set up before the test. Therefore, psychology trumps brain structure where intellectual subjects are concerned.<br /><br />It's an interesting proposition, and one I think needs to be investigated more- much more. There's a lot still to be untangled in gender studies. Intellectual abilities are jumbled in with emotional tendencies, and I definitely think they should be considered separately. She pretty much ignores the effect of hormones on emotional states except for the case of fetal testosterone. I think that while this book doesn't settle any gender issue questions, it does cast a lot of doubt on previous studies and urges us to look at them much harder.the same as each other on the test under these conditions.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me preface with a little history about me,  I am a 22 year old college student studying design who, up until recently thought books were a waste of time. \\"Why not go to the movies instead... more visual and less time\\" is what I would usually say. Two years ago I picked up a book that my girlfriend at the time encouraged me to read, it was a Stephen King book called \\"The Stand\\"... and that's where I got hooked on reading.     I would always talk to people at bookstores, get to know their interest in books and find recommendations that I sometimes hated but most of the time loved, and that's where I found \\"The Hunger Games\\".    From the very moment I picked up \\"The Hunger Games\\" I couldn't put it down. I locked myself in my room and embarked on a journey that I didn't realize would blossom into fascination and a sort of \\"hunger\\" for more, it was only until the middle where I found THAT out. I am a reader who loves many genres (psychological thrillers, mystery, science fiction, and fantasy) and who love many books (\\"Enders Game Series\\" , \\"Enders Shadow Saga\\" , \\"Duma Key by Stephen King\\" , \\"Harry Potter Series\\", \\"The Good Guy by Dean Koontz\\") for what they do to me, that lasting impression, that escapism, that \\"hunger\\" for more or for it to be real. That empowered feeling after reading a book or a series that brings suspense, joy, happiness, anger, grief, and even sadness... and The Hunger Games did all of that.     If you are an adult and are a wondering if you should read this series or not let me tell you bluntly, READ IT! You do yourself a disservice for not reading a series that is great and will, quite possibly, be as big as Harry Potter.    Thank you and happy reading!    - Joseph
B000PMGS8G|5.0|The movie was in great condition and the personal touch of this vendor was very nice.  The note and candy were very nice.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second of a set of three, this book left off around where the first ended... and that's where the journey began. I was quickly engrossed with a world unlike ours but fascinated all the same. A world where uncertainty was present and corruption was the foreground. You always got a sense of dread reading, \\"Catching Fire\\".<br /><br />For those who have read the first and are thinking about reading the second, I would encourage you to read it. There are many books, many series that are being published each month, some good some bad but only a few that we call \\"great\\" and they don't happen everyday. This book and the trilogy itself is one of the greats. I am a 22 year old male college student who studies design... So please, do not be dismayed by the category of \\"Young Adult\\". It is up there with Harry Potter.<br /><br />Thank you and happy reading!<br /><br />- Joseph
B002JVWRAO|5.0|what can i say about this show? i think its great. now i realize this show is not for all. but for me the love these brothers have for one another is enough to keep the show goin it could be a comedy centered on the fact that they will do anything to help the other out. you throw in the drama and paranormal aspect of it however and you have a very good show. if shows about demons and ghosts and angels isn't for you then please don't even bother looking at it or even considering and don't make remarks about it. however if you enjoy seeing shows or movies about all things paranormal and find it interesting how different everyone's views on the matter is then yes this show is for you and please rent it or buy it or tivo it which ever is best for you just find a way to watch it!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders Game, what an amazing adventure... this book is probably one of those books that MADE science fiction/fantasy what it is today.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I'm a woman in her early 30's and I grew up on old school rap in the 80's but after awhile I got tired of the tacky sexist lyrics that took over the airwaves in the late 90's. So, I stopped listening to rap. Fast Forward to 2004 and I hear Jesus Walks on the radio. The song moved me in a way I hadn't felt in a long time listening to a rap song. I went and got the album to see what this young brotha was talking about and I was moved.    This whole album is amazing. The cussing is low and the lyrics made sense and told a story. He didn't have too many guest (which is nice because too many rappers can't carry a song without help nowadays) and he wasn't just talking about sex and rims. Overall I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear real rap with a meaning
0743496736|5.0|This book came on time, in good condition. I have read it and while her subject matter is never \\"fun\\", I consider Jodi Picoult to be one of best writers on current hot-button topics out there today. She has the courage to explore these topics from every point of view, even getting inside the mind of a school shooter in this book.
B002ONC9NC|3.0|Interesting and well acted story about a dedicated 16-year-old student in London, England circa 1961 who is swept off her feet when she meets much older guy (Saarsgard).  As their relationship grows, she realizes her goals of finishing school and going to Oxford are useless as the new man in her life teaches her about having a comfortable life without working. But when she discovers who he really is she realizes everything comes at a price. The movie raises important questions about women and what society expects of them.  And even though the movie is set at the beginning of the 60s, these questions are still valid today. Mulligan is the most beautiful thing I´ve seen on the big screen in a very long time.  Solid entertainment.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This movie is great.  You can't beat Amazon's prices for movies... especially Blu-Rays.  Bought this as a Christmas gift and it showed up in plenty of time.
0525951652|5.0|I have read all of Follett's book. This is the best as he takes three characters and intermingles them with history. I cannpt wait to read the 2nd and 3rd books of this trilogy. If you like Jeffrey Archer, you will love this book.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This movie is great.  You can't beat Amazon's prices for movies... especially Blu-Rays.  Bought this as a Christmas gift and it showed up in plenty of time.
B003ZW0N2K|4.0|It's pretty simple. If you are a fan of OMD, especially any of the albums after their more experimental first several, then you should be pretty pleased with HoM. The MP3 samples on Amazon give you a good idea of what to expect, though they don't really do the songs justice. There is a good mix of very good and decent songs, with only one or two clunkers, but taste is subjective and what I like and dislike, you might not. I think it is great to have the whole band back together again and their recaptured (though slightly modernized) sound is proof that even after the so-so albums of the 90s and 00s, they can recapture the magic that made them special.<br /><br />Who is this album not for? Well, I don't think it'll win over many first-time listeners. Not that it isn't good, but it does have a retro sound I don't see getting much airplay these days. Also, the limited edition version w/DVD is only for the completest hard-core fans. Everyone else can save a little money and get the standard edition or download.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I bought this movie for my sister who has read all the books and saw all of the Twilight saga movies. She loved it. So if you have an avid twilight fan, or are one yourself, you cannot go wrong with this movie.
B00192IV9U|4.0|It is not better than the previous releases but I really like it. As many others comment the songs are not really lined up as Michael would have done so or maybe a few of them were not even finished yet but the songs are great. If you are a MJJ fan you can't afford to miss it.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I'm not gonna go on and on about this and that and plots and story lines.  All I want to say is that this movie kicks butt and after watching the DVD (I wish I saw it in a theater first) I logged onto Amazon and bought it.  I didn't care how much it cost!  How many movies can you say that about?!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I should start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the series. But honestly, how can you not be? It's hilarious, heartfelt, sincere, and above all, innovative. So few shows have the ability to do pretty much whatever they want without letting down the audience, and Community's got boldness. In spades.    At first, the fast-paced delivery of joke after joke is reminiscent of Arrested Development, but in my opinion, Community bests the holy comedy in almost every way. Much like AD, there is no laugh track, and thank the holiest of holies that it doesn't. So much of its charm and comedic effectiveness comes from its rapid fire pace, and a laugh track would have a. gotten in the way and b. been a total buzzkill. The characters do and say hilarious things that should be appreciated on their own merit, and therefore don't need any assistance to remind the audience that THIS IS FUNNY.    Granted, the show doesn't start off perfect, but as the episodes progress, all the characters and the writing really come into their own. Every character is sympathetic, and in time become real three-dimensional people with real motivations and understandable dilemmas. Another brilliant aspect is its longevity. I've watched every episode at least 6 times, every time enjoying it and spotting new things I didn't catch before.    I cannot recommend this show highly enough, and this DVD box set makes for a great gift, and all of the extras/commentary wet my tv geek whistle. Especially recommended for fans of NBC's other magnum opus, 30 Rock.
B000TERFGO|5.0|I found this to be an AMAZING album even though I am not well versed in the Jazz genre.   The creativity of this music was totally unexpected. It's a wonderfully vibrant music listening experience.    Him playing the sax is ridiculously OUTSTANDING.     What a master of the art, Mr. Coltrane was!    I got it for $5 but I would've been happy paying $12!    'A Love Supreme' will be my next purchase from this artist. [[ASIN:B0000A118M A Love Supreme]]
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is seemed like it maybe was a light into what Jaycee Dugard's story may have been.  I couldn't put this book down.
B002ZG983M|4.0|This DVD was not what I expected. I expected comedy, and it ended being very serious. Different story line. Not your typical super hero movie. Good ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read these books! Both young and the umm well not so young can enjoy these wounderful books. With charecters that you connect with from the start you cannot help falling into another world umtil you finish all 3 books. I cannot stress enough how much I love love love these books. Thamk you Suzanne Collins!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This collection has it all!  A cool collectible pyramid box, the game, and all the beauty and sound of Blu-Ray.  One of the Greatest shows that has been on television!!!    I know that the Blu-Ray discs are much more scratch resistant than DVD's, they came in cardboard sleeves that slide into slit-like pockets.  Each season has its own sleeve (quad-fold), available for two per section.  The seasons are all packaged in a separate single cardboard sleeve for putting separately on your shelf.  Mine arrived packaged in a single box with Styrofoam to protect it during shipping and arrived undamaged.  Everything comes packaged inside the pyramid, with a guide to every episode in the series.  The one small issue that I had with this collection was the cardboard slits for the discs, maybe could have used hard plastic with center clips like most other collections.  But, this did not stop me from purchasing, I am just a little bit more careful removing them.    I bought it the day after Thanksgiving for a great price and I am glad that I did.  No regrets about this purchase.    Now, go out and purchase this.  You will not be unsatisfied.    Get LOST!
B001TODCII|4.0|Spoiler alert    This movie is very Halloweenish in so much as the chick with the cherry survives, everyone else perishes.    I would have been happy if the dude had gotten his daughter back with a few punctures, but she comes with narry a blemish where as a compatriot from the exact same timeframe is riddled (40ish) heroin holes and green goop gurgling out of her mouth.    Leem Neelson, much like Matt Damon, makes a surprisingly good bad ass
B002N5N5LG|5.0|The episodes from the first season of Community have the rewatchability of Arrested Development or 30 Rock.  The series is quirky, fun and more than a little bizzare but is all held together by a fantastic cast and immpeccable writing. Each show has a cast and crew commentary, which I love, and some of those commentaries are quite hilarious. A definite pickup for any fan of the show.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I can only say this is not the Robin Hood your parents knew - it holds little resemblance to the story we all know. About the only common factors are Nottingham, Prince John and the Sherriff (Even Robin isn't who you expect), and the children are excellent even if they start as the bane of Marion's life!  However I'd have to give it at least 4 stars for the acting, 5 stars for the sets (except the landing craft!), 5 stars for a more realistic and unraomanticized storyline, 4 stars for the continuity and beleivability / realism with 5 stars for how this twist on the original tale pulled me in and kept there until the closing credits. The special effects were the only part I'd describe as average.  Hope this helps without giving much of anything away about the storyline and ending, which did leave it ripe for a sequel.  Would I recommend it - absolutely!   Watchable again - yes, in time.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This movie is the only thing my daughter asked Santa for. It comes with 3 discs, commendaries and 3 different endings. She has watched this movie everyday since Christmas!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Grandchildren just loved this movie, and grandma did too!! Thanks for the speedy delivery, and the CD was marvelous, the packageing was superb, just as it was it was advertised.  Thanks again I'll be back, regards and best wishes for the new year.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This is a great product.  We are really enjoying the DVD's and all of the information that came with it.  My child is really enjoying the Christmas present!!!!
0895260131|5.0|This is a great book for somebody looking to cut through the PC lies propagated about Islam, Western culture and The Crusades by today's progressive, PC media. Islam never claimed (until very recently) to be a religion of peace. It was spread by military conquest, enslavement and the slaughter of unbelievers. Jihadis today are committed to the goal that Islam and Sharia law must rule throughout the world and that those who refuse to receive Mohammed as Allah's Prophet and Allah as their God will pay whatever price the Muslims decide to mete out. Westerners ignore these fact at their own risk. Mr. Spencer uses copious citations and sources to support his assertions. For those who state that the teachings of Jesus and Mohammed are really the same, he has inserted into each chapter a small box entitled \\"Jesus vs. Mohammed\\" and compares and contrasts the teachings of both. Read this book and arm yourself with the facts.
B00493AD74|1.0|I watched this movie because I thought I would need some inspiration and what not, but this movie was boring, dull and ridiculous. I am so disappointed. I couldn't even finish the film. What a waste of $3.99. It is hard to believe that a woman who doesn't have anything seemingly wrong with her life needs to spend lots of money and go on a trip to \\"find herself.\\"<br /><br />Boo-freakin'-hoo.
B000002UZ1|4.0|You have to wonder at this late date what the function is of this 1967-70 Blue Album and its bookend, 1962-66 (Red). Last year we had massive remasters of all the Beatles Albums, English and American, mono and stereo, EMI and Ebbits. The fabs are also now on I-Tunes. The Beatles finally have the digital ubiquity they should have gotten in the mid-1980s.<br /><br />The Red and the Blue albums were issued in 1973, three years after the Beatles broke up. To me, the idea of a \\"hits\\" package for the best band, the true eighth wonder, is antithetical. Even in 1963, the group was making albums that held together as such when most were just slapping singles together surrounded by filler By 1964 they were advancing, using Bossa Nova and by 1965 they were soaking in Dylan. Every album was a leap, so you really can't divide the fabs into early and late periods.<br /><br />And you really do need to hear every sound of every album--none of us will--to understand rock and Western Music itself. That is a lifetime undertaking. There really are no short cuts with the Beatles: if you get Red and Blue, you may think you found an `inexpensive way to learn about this band, but you are going to wind up thinking that you wasted money in the end. You'll be buying every album very soon anyhow. These sets are a good overview, but in 2010, there are quicker ways to do get this.<br /><br />Trust me, get these sets if you are a complete collector, but if you are just starting out, you might as well just get, say, Please Please Me, Revolver and Sgt Pepper on day one, and start your headlong dive right in.<br /><br />By the way, if you are just getting on your way to full fledged Beatledom, here is a fact for you: the shot on the back cover here is the Beatles at EMI in 1963 and was used for the cover of Please Please me in the UK. In 1969, the Beatles started to record an album called \\"Get Back\\" and were going to use the front shot here-same place-as the cover. But the band was falling apart and Get Back became Let It Be, so the cover was not used until this issue.the cover was not used until this issue.
B003PIUC02|4.0|The first 2 or 3 episodes are kind of cheesy, and resemble a soap opera... but it pick-ups after that.    The photography takes a while to get used to (it looks kind of fake, and not like 300); BUT, as with the plot, it improves after a few episodes.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I love this CD; I neither know nor care if MJ sings on all the tracks.  I will leave that battle to people more qualified than me to determine hopefully in a court of Law. What I do know for sure is that I cry tears of joy and smile every time I hear The Way You Love Me and Best of Joy.  Breaking News and Can't Make it Another Day makes me get up and dance.  Keep Your Head UP is what MJ did so well with his music, he encouraged and inspired his audience like no other artist could. Monster is a sad testament to what the price of fame will cost. I never paid attention to the MJ controversies while he was alive and I want do it now that he is gone.  I'm just grateful that I had a chance to witness the phenomenon that was Michael Jackson and I can't wait for more of his music to be released.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|The instructions were fairly easy. I was very impressed with the quality of the sound as an MP3 when copied from the original vinyl. Copying old songs for my use on my PC and ipod is something I had wanted to do and would highly recommend this Sony turntable and sound software that was included.
B0002TKFRM|5.0|I was once a casual fan of classical music and had bought many of the \\"discount\\" versions of classics.  I have since matured my listening habits and have started buying quality recordings of my favorites.  I have the Living Stereo recording of Scheherazade with Fritz Reiner as conductor and its one of my favorites.  Reiner conducts these pieces as well and they are outstanding.  I highly recommend this CD.
0385523912|3.0|Although I am giving the book three stars, definitely read it. The in depth stories of the defectors lives are amazing, but the author's opinion and organization make the book harder to read.    The author interjecting religion into her piece is unnecessary and annoying. She compared the the North Korean's revelations that the North was bad to people's conversion to atheism. While not religious myself, I found that comment simply rude to those who believe in god. Also the insights into South Korea seem very shallow. She says Seoul has \\"rows of KFC and KFC knockoffs.\\" From the comment the author seems like someone who looked at a bunch of pictures of Seoul rather than actually visiting it.     Regardless, I thought the book was not even organized well. The beginning chapters mixed together an overly simplified Korean history and the beginnings of the stories of the defectors followed in the book. Unfortunately, I already knew the history, but I was forced to read what seemed like pages and pages of over what I already knew. The author did not separate the history and the story into different chapters, so I was forced to read through the history because I did not want to miss the explanations of the characters. The history should have been thrown into an introduction, or given a separate chapter.     The stories of the defector's lives, however, were nothing short of amazing. The idea that people can still love even in times of famine shocked me and enforces the idea people are inherently good. While other reviewers may have thought it was just wasted text mentioning the love lives of the defectors, I thought it was telling of human nature and it definitely had a place in the text.    All in all, I gave this book only three stars because the ridiculousness of the authors comments and the lack of proper organization aside the stories are telling and are one of a kind.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|I buy the most recent release in the series for my brother each Christmas and got him this one this year. He loves it as do I! Sorry to see the show end but I think it was time.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|It's December 28.  I got this game for Christmas and I have already gotten 4 of the 6 endings possible in this game.  Expect a lot of sleepless nights, because you won't want to put the game down and the intricate plot will have you lying awake trying to put all of the pieces together.  The plot is intricate and thought-provoking.  Only through multiple playthroughs can you gather all of the snippets of information necessary to unravel the game's many, many mysteries.  This game is exceptionally well-written and the music and sound effects ratchet up the tension and the drama beautifully.  999 will give you goosebumps and have you leaning closer to the screen, breathlessly waiting to see what happens next.  There is a lot of variety in the puzzles and they get progressively difficult without being insanely hard.  Because you can fast forward through text you've already seen in previous playthroughs, playing the game multiple times is fun without being a chore.  I can't recommend it enough.
0767812166|4.0|I was very pleased with the service I received when ordering and receiving this CD.  I gave it as a gift.  However, I have never watched this movie.
B000JIHP88|5.0|a great item. my little one has really been nursed to sleep with this. it is easy to install and works like a charm. i would recommend getting extra batteries, it takes 3 D (the big ones).
B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock is a new version of the old favorite,and done very well.  It will not disappoint old fans or new ones to the series.  Contemporary, yet it manages to hold onto the classic sense of the original characters. It doesn't let one down at all. Truly enjoyable!
B004APVI1G|5.0|Our family watched this not knowing anything about it.  We received a blu-ray player for Christmas, and we used our free HD rental on VUDU to watch it.<br /><br />All I can say, is WOW.  What a great movie, story for the entire family.  The animation was amazing.  I can't believe what they can do with movies now.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to rent it first, that will just make you want to own it that much more!
B003NRYJLS|4.0|At first I was bored. But after first 10 minutes it became fascinating.Did you see how Jesse wore a face mask that looked like it had fly eyes on it? He was one of Walts \\"flys in his ointment\\" because Jesse is stealing the Meth and going to get everyone in big trouble. Also, at first you have no idea why Walt is so obsessed with killing the fly. As it unfolds you understand that the fly represents all of the huge \\"annoyances\\" that has accompanied Walt's \\"breaking bad\\"....the death of Jesses'girlfriend, the death of everyone on the airplane that crashed, the break up of his marriage, Hank's being shot....as Walt's wife said to him in the previous episode \\"I know that somehow you are responsible for Hanks being in the hospital\\".  Walt had repressed his anxiety and guilt and the fly was a representation of those. He kept trying to exterminate the fly, but never could. Finally, in a Somenex tranquilization he confesses all his feelings to Jesse- he feels so sad and guilty about Jesse's girlfriends death for example. He wishes he had died before the plane went down...then he could have been a hero to his family-(given them the money to support them after his death) he would have had all the money for them, without having had experiences all the consequences of his actions. We see Jesse sympathize and empathize with Walt for the first time in a few episodes, after they've been at each other's throats for weeks. He even risks his own life on the ladder to kill \\"Walt's fly\\". But even after Jesse kills the fly, it comes back in Walt's bedroom. Walt's guilt, shame anxiety will never go away....
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I buy it from amazon, 6 days arrived cool. This stuff is great, I drive with PS3, oh yeah.. first impression for gaming is superB, I feel the real surround, not like virtual surround usually, play medal of honor 2, I can hear the foot step,teammate talking,and fire sound so clearly, I was shock.     For movie and music is good enough too. Still waiting for burning, hope it has significant sound increase. The one I like it is very comfort, it feels like I didn't wear it.    Pros: - sound superB especially on gaming        - very very comfort while wearing        - design is cool, I like it    Cons: - little noisy        - in fact 5 meter only for wireless, I see earforce claim it has 10 meter.    Concl: Must buy if you're love for gaming especially hearing / playing in late night
1416550534|3.0|This book of historical fiction is a very pleasant easy read. But be warned, if you have read more than a few of these you will find yourself in too familiar territory. This is a story of a woman's life, Grace, who became enamored with Hannah, a girl her age, granddaughter of the master in who's house she is a servant. The book spans the time from the heyday of the British aristocracy before WWI to the present and through this we see the devolution of their way of life. I wanted it to be more of a treatise on the class system. How the nobles saw themselves as better than their servants and in the end showing that we are all the same. Apparently the author does not share that view. We do become updated on Grace's life throughout the story but these passages are lackluster when compared to Hannah's.     There are other problems I have with the book.     1) Many times as I was reading, scenes would unfold and I would think, \\"Have I read this book before?\\"     2) It was pretty easy to figure out the what really happens at the lake.    3) It was also even easier to figure out who Grace's real father was.    4) There is a point in the story where the author breaks form and we read about Hannah firsthand and not through Grace. I know Hannah supposedly told Grace all this but, really!!?? It seems like a cheat by the author.    5) I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone so I won't be specific but there is a connection made at the very end of the book that is a little too pat.    6) Grace makes a grand sacrifice for Hannah that the author \\"fixes\\" in the end. Again.....too pat.    7) I found it hard to reconcile the two Graces. Where did the young Grace illustrate any of the drive that the older Grace must have had to complete a doctorate in archaeology as a single mother? The only determination she showed was to blindly live her life for others.    I did enjoy the present day Grace and found the telling of her final days compelling. As I said, it was a very pleasant storybut one who's characters left me the minute I closed the book.

The LP's have Morrissey's original etchings in the middle. The LP comes with a huge fold-out poster of Morrissey. The sounds quality on the LP version is amazing. Bona Drag is a collection of Morrissey's first few singles, and tracks from viva hate. So If you love Morrissey and the Smiths, then this is a must have!!!

B00000K3CR|5.0|\\"Big\\" was made over 20 years ago in 1988.  Tom Hanks was just the right age and perfect star for this role.  It amazes me how well he interprets being a young boy in a man's 30 year old body.  The young boy is named Josh Baskin (David Moskow), who has a crush on an older girl.  While at an amusement park, he is stunned to learn she is dating  a boy that is old enough to drive.  He leaves her in line for a ride, as he is disqualified for being too short for the thrill ride on a roller coaster.  Soon he makes a wish at a carnival \\"Magic Seer\\" machine.  It is an old machine and the robot inside looks devilish with red flashing eyes.  Josh wishes to only be \\"big\\" and receives a card from the machine saying his wish will be granted.  He goes to sleep that night at home in a room shared with his baby sister and wakes up a grown man.  He is astounded and frightened as well.  When he tries to tell his mother he grew up overnight, she screams and becomes panicky - and thinks this man has stolen her boy.<br /><br />Josh realizes he can't go back home until he returns to his normal size.  So the next day he travels with his 12 year old friend with the mission to find the same machine that can fix his wish to be a boy again.  Because of his youthful mind, he gets a job in a toy company and moves up fast as he knows what toys kids like, and what to make that will sell.  He has to adjust to adult ways, and Hanks plays the role to the hilt!  Hanks, as Josh,  also plays the best childlike romantic lead with a woman (Elizabeth Perkins - who looks like a young Judy Garland).  I laughed as he tried to eat cocktail corn at a party.  His apartment was nothing but a playground and the whole story was fresh and appealing.  What fun to be young at heart and be paid for it.  The movie is one of the most classy and appealing stories I have enjoyed.<br /><br />This movie is a classy classic.
B003JZCL4Q|5.0|This series is a one of a kind show with spectacular graphics. It's more grown up than the 2 Series before it, and brings the Stargate Lore to the forefront. The show gets better and better up until the end, and leaves you on the edge of your seat wanting more. I recommend this to any Stargate fan!
0345509617|5.0|Hard to do a review like this that doesn't sound like forced, paid-for gushing. But I'll spare all the examples and longwinded \\"whys\\" and simply say that if you, like me, love this movie and grew up wondering about how they made it (and the stories behind Yoda, Boba Fett, the Imperial Walkers, tauntauns, how they built a life-size Millennium Falcon and a Dagobah set, etc.), spend the $53 and get this book.    I've had it since Christmas Eve and I've not put it down. If it was just the text part, it would be worth the price. But the fact that it's packed to the gills with photos, drawings, script excerpts, behind-the-scene/on-set photos, models and prototypes, costume sketches, candid photos of Lucas, Kirshner, Ford and all the rest, etc. just puts it over the top.    If you're a true fan of this movie, you're crazy if you don't get this book. You're missing out on one of the most interesting \\"making of\\" stories out there!

B0043RSE2M|4.0|This is my third 3D movie and one of my favorite movies of 2010.  The movie is funny and my daughter loves it. I'll let others comment more on the movie.     I want to comment a little on the 3D. I noticed very little cross talk and the details were impressive. The 3D effect has definitely gotten better since the Monsters vs Aliens disc I got with my Samsung package back in May 2010.  The special effects weren't over the top. Overall, this movie makes me glad I purchased a 3D TV.

There are so many special moments in this film that really make you think and tug at your heartstrings!!  I have four grandchildren from 9-11 and all of them took some good lessons from this movie.  This is one for my collection that we will watch as often as we watch \\"You've got Mail\\", Wizard of Oz\\" and almost all the Disney movies!!  Grandma G
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|A great movie for fans of the Final Fantasy 7. A good way to remember the characters of the Playstation one's game. The quality of the graphics is impeccable. The extra material is very good. Do not miss the opportunity to see.
0385341008|5.0|Like the main character in the book, you are slowly drawn in by the amazing group of people living on Guernsey and soon find yourself making new friends along with her. What makes this book so refreshing is the format of being written in letters...it will make you despise email and texting and long for a beautifully handwritten letter from a friend filled with good stories and news. Do read this book and do become a member of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society...you will not regret it for a moment!
B00275EHJG|5.0|I was am a fan of all Pixar flicks, as I feel they are very well put together.  Toy Story 3 continues the adventures of Woody and gang and does right by the previous 2 films without missing a step.  I am a grown man and teared up a few times (I like to think I'm a tough guy, so this rarely happens), which is a testimont of how well this film connects with it's audience!
B002NXSRX4|5.0|The movie was so cool! I loved it. I wish they continue with G.I. Joe movies! It is wort watching and owning on DVD or blue-ray! The story is good, the characters are nice. Some are better then the others.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Excellent quality.  It is amazing to see more detail and things you never noticed before and that makes watching these movies again worthwhile.

B001NLKT60|3.0|\\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" is one of those infuriating books which are not quite bad enough to abandon.<br /><br />To be clear, crime fiction is not a genre I typically read, and I started \\"Tattoo\\" solely for some mindless diversion while on a family vacation.  Like other readers, I was intrigued by the Lisbeth Salander character, even if other aspects of Stieg Larsson's first novel seemed less interesting.  However, in the second book of his trilogy, the author demonstrates that his inspired choice of heroine was pretty much the only good idea he had - and then he manages to squander that one.<br /><br />\\"Fire\\" makes it abundantly clear that despite all the love the Larsson trilogy is receiving on bestseller lists, the whole series is simply a Nordic-inflected blast of cheesy pop fiction.  However, rather than throw it aside and move on to more rewarding material, I continued to read the lengthy second novel, albeit with increasing dissatisfaction and annoyance - hardly a ringing endorsement, but there it is.<br /><br />Among my complaints:<br /><br />- In the first novel, Salander was an undersized, dysfunctional loser with a random handful of capabilities that made her an improbable heroine.  She was interesting.  In \\"Fire\\", she's a cartoon superhero who suddenly sports a resume to make Lara Croft envious: she's a math savant on a Harley, a ninja-quick street fighter who dispatches bad guys with aplomb, and a misunderstood outcast shouldering a ludicrously dysfunctional family history.<br /><br />- Larsson's inexplicable insistence on specifying computers, cell phones, PDAs (really, PDAs?), and seemingly the entire IKEA catalog by model names inevitably makes his writing sound amateurish and outdated.<br /><br />- Too many bit-part actors!  Some of this may be due to my lack of familiarity with Scandinavian surnames, but the confusing stream of cops, journalists, and thugs did little to advance the already-muddled plot.<br /><br />The most damning indictment of all?  Despite my kvetching and disappointment in how thoroughly Larsson brought his promising debut novel crashing back to earth in \\"Fire\\", I bought the third and final book of the series.  Hope springs eternal.in how thoroughly Larsson brought his promising debut novel crashing back to earth in \\"Fire\\", I bought the third and final book of the series.  Hope springs eternal.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Zombieland is a lot of fun! I love that movie. I want more movies like this! Characters are good and a lot of fun through the whole movie!
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|It had suspenseful, scary moments in the \\"who's next?\\" kind of feeling whenever the elevator dimmed.  However, there was no real scariness because I didn't feel connected to any of the characters.  None of them have any real depth and even if they are sinners, I think it would have been a lot better/creepier if they spent some helping us identify with any of them.  In Drag Me to Hell, the 'sin' that protagonist Christine makes is one we can all see ourselves possibly doing under stress from work and or wanting to prove people wrong (her bf's family thought she was 'unworthy' of him).  And then being tormented by the Devil afterward is scary because that felt like a truly unfortunate twist of fate.  I would recommend watching that one if you haven't yet.      Also, the twist in the end of Devil could not really have been foreseen, unlike the one in the Sixth Sense, where, if you go back and watch it, M. Night was definitely dropping us carefully placed hints along the way.  It just doesn't have the same attention to detail, which makes this movie a scary while you're watching it but very forgettable afterwards.
1423113381|4.0|This book is the first and a strong start to this new series. Riordan creates and epic tale combining action, humor, and lots of suspense. In this story, there are two children, Carter and Sadie Kane. Their father is Julius Kane who is an Egyptologist. Their mother died six months ago and ever since, Carter has been traveling and being \\"home-schooled\\" with his father. Sadie, on the other hand, lives with her grandparents, the Faust's. On Christmas Eve, the two siblings are reunited and their father decides to bring them to the British Museum and \\"make things right\\". But on the way, shadowy figures follow them and at the museum, Julius Kane summons a mysterious figure who banishes Julius and causes a fiery explosion.       Soon Carter and Sadie find out secrets about the world and how the ancient Egyptian world is awakening. They must stop Set, an evil god, from destroying the world and making it his own. To save their father and the world, the go on a perilous journey facing great dangers and tests while finding out secrets about their mother and life.        This was a very intense book and with the humor included it makes a great book. There are some boring parts but overall, this book was good.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|This product is great for just a quick \\"sweep\\" job.  It is not intended to be used as a vaccuum; however, I was surprised by the \\"pick-up\\" power.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|I was one of the many Avatar fans who bought the first dvd when it came out already knowing a 3 disc delux would come out. I didnt think it would be good enough. Then I found out what would be on it:    -The original cut  -The re release cut (8 extra minutes)  -The extended cut (the 8 minutes plus another 8)  -A censored cut (the foul language removed)    Special features:  -Watch the added scenes without watching the movie  -Deleted scenes (yeah thats right, additional to the 16 min. in the  extended, there are deleted scenes)  -Behind the scenes    Yeah there arent many special features but the lengh. The deleted scenes are over 1 hour long, the behind the scenes isnt a few short ones. Its practically a full lengh documentary being at a hour and a half. So if they combined the extended cut will the deleted scenes the movie would be at least 4 and half hours.     Now the dvd does have its flaws. One its 3 on discs, all 4 versions are on both discs but half on each. So half way through the movie you have switch discs, no matter what version you are watching. Even though the special features are great, I would have liked a commentary for at least the theatrical version.    The deleted scenes are all unfinished. Most of them are half done digital affects, the others still behind green screens and one just has the actors in motion capture suits acting out the scene.    Also, the case looks great but the way the dvds are kept in. They are in a slot in cardboard with no protection. So there is a chance you'll get scratches    Pros:  -4 different versions of the movie  -Over a hour of deleted scenes (not in any version)  -A hour and a half long documentary on how they made the movie  -The look of the dvd case    Cons:  -Half way through the movie you have to switch discs  -No commentary  -The way the dvds are in the case  -The deleted scenes are half finished  -They tricked fans into buying the 1 disc and then releasing this dvd set. So either miss out on this great dvd or buying 2 copies.    This dvd is a buy, if you own the 1 disc. Upgrade
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I have seen this movie on tv many times but everytime I found it I had missed the beginning. So I desided to just buy it. I'm so glad I did. It is a great movie. Drew is perfect in it. and the ending is wonderful. Also The girl who plays Rose in Two & a half Men is in it and she has a good part. If you have not seen this movie do buy it.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|The Eagle Eye is a Godsend for FPSs! I used to play FPSs on the PC so trying to get used to the PS3 controller just wasn't working for me. But the Eagle Eye brings it all back.     So far I've used it on Killzone 2 and COD: Black Ops. Works great on both except: Killzone 2 does not give you enough sensitivity adjustment for my liking. I turned the sensitivity all the way up and it's still not fast enough. Not a problem with Black Ops. Also, Killzone 2 has a few parts of the game where you have to tilt the controller to perform certain tasks. Pretty sure you can't do that with a kb/mouse. So I had to keep switching back to the PS3 controller to perform those tasks and then back to the Eagle Eye to continue. If there is a way to switch between controllers on the fly during a game I would sure love to know. Again, has not been an issue with Black Ops so far.    Programming the key maps was no problem and it's nice that you can have 2 different key maps for different games. Most games use pretty much the same layout for the PS3 controller but it's not 100%. I had to end up writing down the key map and I keep it handy until I memorize it. I would recommend writing it down or printing it out and denoting which games you use for each layout. It comes in handy if you want to go back and maybe change one thing about the layout. It would be nice if the Eagle Eye kept a file on your hard drive with your previous layout.

B0009P5YXO|3.0|My son is a huge Doctor Who fan and wanted nothing more than his own 10th Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver for Christmas.  While this does resemble the one from the show, it has not stood up to a six-year-old.  The caps for the pen and marker are very difficult for an adult to remove and my son has already broken one of the prongs that hold the changeable marker and pen ends onto the screwdriver and I have had to glue it back on several times.  The light does work on any of the glow in the dark markers which is fortunate since he cannot get the cap off the one that came with the screwdriver.  I would not recommend this for a young child, it will not hold up.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I bought 'The Sound of Music' as a gift.  The blu-ray restoration is of course,  great - no doubt about it!<br /><br />This classic movie on blu-ray will forever be a great gift idea for any occasion or a Holiday stocking stuffer.<br /><br />If you already own 'The Sound of Music' on DVD, then the upconversion on your blu-ray player would do a fairly good job with the video.  It certainly will not be 1080p Hi-Def with 7.1 DTS-HD Sound, but the difference is just not worth discarding your 'The Sound of Music' DVD to re-purchase this 45th Anniversary re-mastered blu-ray.<br /><br />My advice to you then? ... Just add [[ASIN:B003VS0CX8 The Sound of Music (Three-Disc DVD/Blu-ray set)]] to your wish list and wait. ... There's always an occasion for gift giving and ... for receiving! :))
B000FCK9D6|2.0|I have recently started reading A.C.'s books on my Kindle. I'm used to seeing some typos in the eReader versions of books, but I was appalled at seeing 27 in Death on the Nile! Mostly they were OCR typos, a space was needed between words or the space was misplaced. I tried to write to the publisher: Harper Collins, but found that their website was diabled as of 12/19/10. I really like reading these books on my Kindle, but so far, I've only found the Harper Collins versions. Are there others with less typos? Is there perhaps the complete works of Agatha Christie?
B00275EHJG|4.0|I have enjoyed the Toy Story series since it was released in 1995.  The series has adapted and pushed to create greater movies instead of riding the steam of the original movie.  Toy Story 3 up to the reputation as it pushed you to tears with a wonderful warm ending.  Another great Disney-Pixar production that is fun for the entire family.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Solid action movie.  Covers well worn ground, but it didn't feel derivative.  Almost lost a star due to the ham-fisted Joline song edit at the end.  Re-ordered the verses.  I will NEVER understand why people making movies think people won't notice that kind of thing.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|I bought this as a gift and when the recipient opened it - we found that the album \\"Beatles For Sale\\" was missing a disk!
B000M341QE|5.0|I was wary of this movie because of the \\"all-star cast,\\" which too often in movies means that egos clash and you're left with a half-made film that still makes money because of the names involved.  However, my fears were swept aside within the first ten minutes, which indicates that this is a new take on the classic gangster films in the vein of The Godfather, and by the end, I was convinced that this film is destined to become a classic.  The dialogue is a lot like the violence - visceral and unforgiving without getting in the way of the central plot or themes.  The acting is simply superb, and every member of the cast deserves recognition.  The pacing is near perfect, and there are several twists at the end.  Again, though, this movie does not revolve around its twist, unlike other recent films, and it's amazingly re-watchable even when you know what's coming.  I gave this movie five stars because you get exactly what you pay for - a gritty crime drama that uncovers new territory for its genre while still delivering a solid film.
0060531053|4.0|This book was recommended for my boyfriend, who is just learning to brew his own beer. He was thrilled to receive it. It's full of great tips. Highly recommend. It was a little bit worn, but fine for our use & it was shipped very promptly.
159448385X|5.0|I've previously read The Kite Runner and really enjoyed it, so I decided to read A Thousand Splendid Suns. I was so absorbed in the story that I read the entire thing in two days. It was very easy to read and I thought it was very interesting. I definitely recommend it and I am pleased how it ended. So many things in it were hard to believe because it's so sad to think that that's how women are actually treated in other countries. I've been interested in the Middle East for a few years and I think this book was informative about what happened the last 30 some years as well as a good read and a great story!! Enjoy!!
1601251505|5.0|This is the true successor to 3.5. If you want to play D & D with all the pedantic nuances developed over 30+ years of rigorous nerdiness, Pathfinder is for you. If you want a dumbed down pseudo computer game maybe go for 4th Ed. There is everything you need in this book to run a campaign, and along with the Bestiary you've got all that's required. Word to the Pathfinder, though like every D & D Roleplay they should give you more space on the character sheet.

B000P0J06U|2.0|I waited for this much anticipated sequel only to be disappointed.  Michael Keaton did not seem to carry the movie as he did with the first one.  The focus of the movie seem to be on the Penguin and Catwoman characters.  The story of the Penguin is a sad one but I do not need to hear about it for the entire story.  Catwoman as a love interest for Batman was overrated and the final scene where Batman reveals to Catwoman who he is was weak.  Still a good movie no less.
B001HN694K|5.0|Disregard the snobbish reviews and explore the movie for yourself.  I was surprised at how much I ENJOYED this film. Yes, it seemed a little drug-induced and surreal but I really enjoyed that fantasy quality.  It felt like a dream. Depp's portrayal of the Mad-Hatter is sensitive. The character of Alice goes beyond just being one a girl caught up in a wild adventure. She's a Joan of Arc. She's a girl with a mission and a real heroine. I loved this movie. Give it a chance and decide for yourself.
B001OST0LW|3.0|This Batman movie intrigues me at times.  You have Val Kilmer as Batman which to me would not have been my first choice, but he tends to bring out the dark side of the character better than Michael Keaton.   Jim Carey as the Riddler was dead on.  Jim showcased all his talents playing that character.  Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face did not impress me much.   Then there is Nicole Kidman as the psychiatrist with a fascination for the Batman.  To be honest, I would have left her character out and see how the movie would have played out.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|The songs on this cd are very fun, energetic, and thought provoking. For example, \\"Uprising\\" makes you think of the importance of why it is better for people to be more united when it comes to standing up to their government. The video to the song really gives it more dimension. It is really weird but creative at the same time because of the teddy bears utilized in the video that are making some angry faces. I was intrigued to watch the video to understand the song some more, and also because \\"Uprising\\" is my husband's favorite song. My favorite part of the \\"Uprising\\" song is where the Muse Frontman Matt Bellamy sings \\"If You Could Flick a Switch, and Open Your Third Eye, You'd See that We Should Never Be Afraid to Die\\". The reason why I enjoy that part of the song is because it symbolizes to me the importance of seizing opportunities in life even if you intend to joyfully live a long life. I believe the song \\"Resistance\\" is about how what is wrong or right in love is shaped by whoever is perceiving it (depending on the person). My personal favorite song of this album is \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" song.  It has a very original beat, and very romantic lyrics.  \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" is a song that many are going to enjoy regardless of one's romantic level. \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" is a beautiful message about someone that wants to have a passionate affair with someone regardless of what may have transpired in that individual's past. It is suprising to me that the \\"Undisclosed Desires\\"has yet to see radio airplay where I live because it is very enjoyable. Overall, this collection is going to appeal to many who enjoy pop and/or rock music.
B0045DO8NI|5.0|Very happy with this purchase.  CD & DVD are inserted into a sturdy book jacket with a few pic's and verbage from Pink.  The music selection is perfect, with the feel that Pink thoughtfully selected each song for the CD with the intent of fun!    The DVD also just uplifts you and gets you dancing and singing along.  This is a MUST have for the consummate Pink fan!!!
B00275EGX8|1.0|Why did everybody and I mean everybody make such a big deal about how great this was when it came out.  I didn't find a single person that disliked the film in the first 6 months.  Now it seems people are seeing the light and this film for what it is.  There is almost no plot, the characters are simple and hateful and apart from the locations that look pretty good the film is a disaster.    Honestly, I wanted them all to die after just a few minutes.  This film does nothing for either the art of film or the men and woman fighting in Iraqistan.    I would give zero stars if possible.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I had seen this movie years ago and loved it. I wanted my four year old to see it, however, I was a little concerned that she might be too young to enjoy it. Not so! We have watched it three times! This is the only version of the Sound Of Music that I would recommend; it has DVD and Blu-ray DVD.
1440503257|5.0|This is a great cookbook.  It isn't just about the sweets and goodies in the movies.  There are some excellent \\"real\\" recipes in it.  I love the little \\"aside\\" notes the author included.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone who loves Harry Potter.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I personally loved this series from start to finish, unlike 50% of the lost viewers that fell off this show because they had attention deficit disorder.  Being patient and enjoying the mystery, despite the long wait for answers, was very well worth it. The final 2 seasons make up for many of the side-way stories that took place over seasons 2-3 that many people seemed to hate, though i personally felt they delved nicely into the character development for a lot of our characters.    For the black friday price of $125, this set is undeniably one of the best steals of the year.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is the only TV show I've ever bought. Well worth it. I'd forgotten how funny those first episodes were. I also got season 2 and 3.
B00386EZJU|2.0|sound track is alright; order of pieces are almost in the order that they appears in the movie.  Like the addition of the bag pipe; which is a instrument that you don't hear option...of course like most pieces; each charactor has their own theme which is presented thru out the arrangements.
0060723513|5.0|I enjoyed this book for it's incredible truths and wonderful revelations Ms. Morgan experienced through another indigenous tribe that has been wholesale murdered and destroyed by so called civilized culture. Happened to the Indians of South America and America and all throughout Africa.    These stories are finally being told by the people and those able to get the word out with a voice that has no vindictiveness quite the  contrary it's a wonderful curiosity to when we in the Western world are going to see the destruction we've created by our elevated opinion of ourselves.    This book will bring you to humble thoughts of what Love, truth and compassion and gratitude can accomplish in Life.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I enjoyed the movie set. It was a great value for the money. Just be careful as the show is not for everyone. The language is really bad and is really sexual in nature, so it is not for those offended by these things or for the young.
B003MC5N28|5.0|A great read.  A peak at a &#34;perfect&#34; home and how it can become not so perfect.  I didn't want to put it down.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I have only heard Lady Gaga on the radio.  My 11 year old daughter and I love the songs on the radio so I put this onto my wish list to listen with her.  I received it for Christmas.  I was quite surprised when it arrived and I looked through the lyrics how much bad language is in her other songs.  The \\"F\\" word is strewn through a her songs.  I know not all parents are concerned with what their children listen to as I am, however I wouldn't recommend this CD for children.  I wish there had been a warning about the foul language, or if there was and I missed it I wish it was more prominent.  I also wish I wasn't stuck with a CD that I don't want.
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|I bought this game for my 3 girls, 6, 8, & 9 thinking it would be great. Basically you just get to play with legos in game form. The rules are pretty basic, build what is in the picture. There is actually a set of rules that says make up your own rules. Don't waste your money. Most likely these legos from the game will just end up in a bucket for the kids to play with.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I live in a small town in the middle of the Rocky Mountains so there is almost no radio reception here...my wife has Satellite radio so it's no big deal to her, but I get tired of changing cd's all the time (even tho I have a 5 cd changer in the car). A friend had a cheapo fm transmitter in his ride that worked ok, but had some issues. However, I really liked the concept so I did a little research and came up with the Satechi Soundfly as the best all around buy for the money. The Soundfly worked great except I was not too happy with the shuffle function. It worked just ok, but not the way I had hoped. Called Satechi directly and was pleasantly surprised by their willingness to solve my problems...customer service, what a concept! The tech there, (Allen), suggested that the Soundfly Aux would be better for what I was looking for (better shuffle function) and offered to upgrade me...for free! Whoa! Yeah, it  was only 5 or 6 bucks difference in price, and I had to pay to ship my original purchase back to Satechi, but they made a new friend. The new transmitter works killer and I have sold three of them for Satechi already by talking up the product and the service...I' ve just had it back a few days now but I am super pleased. I have over 2000 songs loaded onto a USB flash drive and it plays with great sound quality. I love this thing...get one!
1400067936|3.0|I find the topic of this book interesting but I feel like N.N.Taleb could have made his point in much less pages. The book contains lots of anecdotes related to randomness in finance and use it to show that our way of reasoning is subject to be fooled by randomness.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The first time I saw this, I thought, \\"meh.\\"  This film grew on me after repeat viewings, though.  It's not as good as the original, but I would still recommend it.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Transaction was ridiculously quick and smooth.  Ordered it when i was at home sick and it arrived so quickly I was able to enjoy it days later as i recovered.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|In this film, R Lee Ermey gives the best performance in any movie ever made ever.  And a bunch of people get shot.  Pretty sweet flick.
031603438X|4.0|Enjoyed the read.  Had a hard time to put it down.  Got a little lost in the guitar stuff as I am not musically inclined but a very good read.
B000EZ7ZZE|5.0|This film has hot chicks, and it has zombies. That's really all you need in order to make a good movie. Buy this.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|This movie is absolutely wonderful. It is just as great as the first two films. The only thing I did not like is that one of the characters was not in this movie but was in the first two. It seems that they just decided to not have that character in the movie which was a bit odd. The movie was funny and emotional. If you liked the first two you will love this one.
B000YPUFA6|5.0|This film has hot chicks, and it has zombies.  That's really all you need in order to make a good movie.  Buy this.
096798467X|5.0|This book is awesome.  The instructions, the photos, and the author's creative inspiration are just great, too.  Charming extras like the author's wife's bread dough recipe make this one of the best in the how-to-build with cob collection!
B002ZG981E|5.0|If you've read any of my other reviews and think I'm a loon, please believe me when I say that you will really, really love this movie.  It's like Ocean's 11 meets Nightmare on Elm St meets James Bond or something like that.  You'll have to watch it at least a dozen times to catch everything.  It's a seriously dense, intelligent, and mind-bending film.  Also, there's tons of gun play.  And there's hot chicks in it, but they keep their clothes on.  Normally, fully clothed women would knock at least one star off a rating, but it's friggin Inception, man.  Just watch the movie, and you'll see what I mean.    Most important of all -  DON'T watch this movie stoned.  You will have absolutely NO idea what is going on.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is an amazing glimpse into the real lives of our past heroes.  I loved Band of Brothers and this is a great 'sequel' to that project.  The cinematography, and stories told throughout the series will tug at your heartstrings, and give you a greater appreciation for the sacrifices that were made by those men.  If you enjoy war movies, books, interviews, or just want to experience history in a vivid manner, this is a great set to purchase.
B001CO42MU|5.0|If you like Johnny Depp, and if you like cocaine, then you will love this movie.  Even if you've never done drugs before, this film will get you pumped up and make you want to become a drug kingpin.
0439023513|5.0|No spoilers here. I was surprised, but in the end, pleased, by how this book turned out. The main messages; war is hell, power is dangerous no matter what side you're on and good people get damaged by that power. I was surprised that Katniss didn't end up being the stereotypical hero but I felt the book reached a more profound depth because of that. She sees that power in the wrong hands need to be resisted and she acts accordingly. Mockingjay is powerful because it has no easy answers. Highly recommended.

B001RL4K1Q|5.0|No review needed.  If you haven't already seen this film, then you are so out of touch that you probably don't even know what the internet is.  If you don't own this, then buy it.  If you already own it, then buy another copy.  Danny Boyle needs the money to make the planned sequel entitled Porno (buy the book).
B0021L8V0M|5.0|\\"Salt\\" is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It is fast paced, the topic is about sleeper cells and there was one found in the USA just this year.  Angelina Jolie is one of the best actresses of all time.  Everyone should really like this movie.<br /><br />And, as Kathleen said, to find ALL THREE VERSIONS, go to MENU and you will see the star (mine is blue) on the LEFT SIDE of 'PLAY MOVIE'.  You SELECT that and wham, all three versions are listed.  If you select the \\"star\\" to the RIGHT of PLAY MOVIE, then the movie will start, so select the one on the left.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This is just the best friggin movie ever.  Definitely the best mainstream martial arts film released in 2010.  If you're an old school gamer such as myself (been gaming for the past three decades), then you will absolutely love this film.  In fact, you almost have to have owned an 8-bit NES system to fully understand this film.  Even if you aren't a gamer please buy this.  I want the producers of the film to make a butt-load of money so they make a sequel.  Also, there's a hot Asian chick in it.  I like hot Asian chicks.  They're purty.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|For those of you not yet familiar with \\"True Blood\\" it seems to be \\"Angel\\" meets \\"Twilight\\" meets \\"Suppernatural\\" meets \\"Sex and the City.\\"  Due to the adult graphic themes of the show it is a show not suited for young viewers.    What attracts me to the show is the story.  Against the odds (life and death, mortal and imortal) Sookie and Bill thrive together.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Spoiler Alert!    The allies win the war.      Even though I just ruined the ending I promise you will still enjoy the film.  I mean, come on.  Brad Pitt and Eli Roth acting in a Tarantino movie?  What's not to love?  Also, a bunch of people get shot.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|My sister and her husband got us interested in this series and now we are addicted.  Dexter is truly, to borrow a word, 'diseased'!  It is fascinating that anyone can think this way.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|It's a Batman film, and Joel Schumacher had nothing to do with it.  Therefore, it kicks butt.  Also, Cillian Murphy has really pretty eyes.
1400064287|5.0|Really amazing book.  I was a bit skeptical at first, in that so many books are out there like this.  However, this book has incredible content.  I spent a couple of days revisiting in a bookstore, looking and reading it through.  There was SO much great content that I decided this was one I wanted for my library to re-read and study more thoroughly.      They do a great job at breaking this down into a science/method..........without being too simplistic or formulaic.  Definitely recommend to anyone involved in marketing/sales.
B002AF4Y96|5.0|Screw Citzen Kane.  This is honest to god the best film in the history of the cinema.  Not only is there wall to wall ultraviolence, but the movie has a message, so you don't have to feel guilty about enjoying the violence.  Cheering for the killers is the whole point of the movie.  Of course, I cheer for the killers every single time I watch a movie, but this movie makes it ok to do so.
030746363X|2.0|Took a good look at this (1.5 hours) at a local bookstore - and wasn't that impressed.  Format of narrative and lots of \\"data\\" made it a frustrating read.     All that said, had some interesting information in there - especially a couple of dietary ideas that I hadn't heard before (supplements that don't have addictive qualities and cold water treatments).
B0028T6XXY|5.0|WHO EVER DOSEN'T LIKE THIS SET IS NUTS. THE CONCERT PARTS WHERE GREAT, BUT THE PERSONAL STUFF WAS EVEN BETTER. I WISH I KNEW THIS MAN PERSONALY BECAUSE HE JUST SEEMS LIKE SO MUCH FUN TO BE AROUND. THE BEST PART IS THE LOYALTY HE HAS TOWARDS HIS PEOPLE. I CAN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO PLAY IN NEW YORK AGAIN. COME BACK SOON
B002ZG994U|4.0|Okay, so the show The A-Team was never rocket science, but this film is lots of fun, plus the stunts are impressive; not every film you see needs to be a 'masterpiece' it should be fun and enjoyable...and this one is!! I loved the series and found this film version of the series lots of fun with elements of the series in-tact! The cast is excellent as well! I hear a second A-Team film is in the works, and I hope so...I LOVE BRADLEY COOPER AS \\"FACEMAN\\"!!!!<br /><br />P.S.  If you enjoyed The A-Team, you'll like The Expendables as well!!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|Quite simply, I was very much looking forward to this movie, but have never been more disappointed in a movie in my life.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Kurt Russell and more star in Quentin Tarantino's 2007 action thriller.<br />Young women are hunted by a psychotic stuntman who uses his car<br />to kill people. This isn't bad and Kurt is great as usual. This dvd has<br />good picture and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Both my boyfriend and I ordered this knife for camping and hiking. SO far, it works great! I have small hands and this knife still fits my grip perfectly! My boyfriend also likes it too and fits well in his manly hands! I would recommend!
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|I have been a fan on Tropper's ever since I read his book \\"This is Where I Leave You\\".  His writing is both at times laugh-out-loud funny, and thought provoking.  This time, reading \\"How to Talk to a Widower\\" hit just the right note at just the right time for me.  I had just delivered a stillborn daughter, and the way Tropper described the overwhelming grief and anger Doug felt was EXACTLY the way I felt - but was unable to put that feeling into words.  That almost explosive outrage and grief tempered by this overwhelming apathy was perfectly expressed by him - as only someone who has lost the most precious thing can possibly understand.  Tropper somehow knows grief, but doesn't shove trite phrases down your throat to get you to understand it with him.  I absolutely loved this book, and laughed for probably the first time in weeks - while crying in the very next chapter.  WONDERFUL!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This flash, with the flash turned up (bounce flash) simply solves the problem of casting shadows when using flash photography indoors.  It just fills the room with light.   It is light weight and comes with a nice carrying case.
B00000F566|5.0|I had all the versions of Dirty Dancing except this one. This was the only one to have the concert. I watched the concert on VHS years ago. It's cheesy, but it has great music and brings back good memories.
0439023513|2.0|SPOILERS!!!!  The title of my review sums up my feelings about this novel.  I was addicted to the first two books.  I could not put them down.  When it came time to read the last book I kept saying that I needed to pace myself since I knew it was the last but instead I read it in a day.  In the end, there was no need to rush.  Now, that I've finished the trilogy I feel as wronged and empty as Katniss felt at the end of Mockingjay.      First of all, after reading the first two books I viewed this as a story about an incredible character named, Katniss.  I felt that the war was a backdrop to the character. This was was what shaped her, matured her, tested her.  But, by the end of the series it changed.  It became about war, war is bad, blah, blah.  Everyone knows this.  This is nothing new.  I do not need Finnick to get chewed to death or for Prim to incinerate for me to know this.  But, what I didn't know and what I wanted to know was how Katniss would resolve this issue of war, this issue of being a pawn, of loving two different boys.  These things were never told to me because she spent the majority of the book hiding, getting injured, being unconscious, staying drugged, or half insane.  It was horrible enough that the usually dependable character of Peeta was hijacked but so was the character of Katniss.  Her character and her reactions to the Games and the war were what made me invested in this story.  There was none of that in Mockingjay.  She just simply existed. Gale and Peeta were both seriously injured at the end and she didn't even try to find them once she healed.  Really?  These two men she would die to protect she suddenly could care less about them when one got shot and the other got burned? The author seemed too focused on throwing in as many tragedies as possible instead of showing us any genuine reactions or dialogue from the characters the readers cared about. Also, when Peeta was struggling to find his old self back in 13 she did nothing to help him but just kept avoiding him.  In fact, that was really what she did the whole story which was such a change from who she was in The Hunger Games.  The second thing I didn't like was there was just so much pointlessness.  When the heroes leave for their mission to assassinate Snow I think that we are finally going to see Katniss take control and stop being a pawn.  We are finally going to see her mature and figure out who she's going to love.  I'm waiting and waiting for this pivotal moment.  I've got no time to grieve for Boggs or Finnick because I'm just trying to hang on to the climax that will make everything worthwhile.  It never happens.  Peeta and Gale get injured \\"offscreen\\".  Prim who stayed in the background for most of the book suddenly gets plopped literally right down into the middle of all the action only to die.  I'm still thinking there's time for this great climax BUT NO!  Once again, Katniss gets injured only this time it's worse. Not only does she watch her sister die but she gets to forever carry scars that will remind her of how her sister died.  But, that's not enough. Apparently, Peeta will also carry the same scars, too, only the readers don't even get to read what happen to him.  All of this just seemed so pointless.  I understand that war is bad and unpredictable but it did nothing to move forward any kind of plot or character development. I just felt like the author was trying to hammer home how terrible war can be but people already know this.  This story in my mind should have stayed on track with the character of Katniss.  Also, just how many people in a book can be \\"losing it\\" at one time?  You have Katniss, Peeta, Finnick and Annie all having mental problems???  That's a bit too much.  Third of all, there were so many things unresolved.  The resolution between Katniss and her two men just simply happened by chance it seemed.  Gale invented the bomb that killed her sister so she simply picked Peeta.  It helped that Peeta moved back to12 and Gale did not.  Would she have tried to find him if he didn't?  Did she pick him because he was the only one there?  Would she have picked Gale if he moved back?  She was never proactive with her choices in the end.  Everyone else made all her choices for her.  Then there were other characters never fully resolved.  Effie suddenly appeared at the end with little written about that.  The style team just went away.  Gale never really said good bye.  There was no scene to find out about how Annie was coping. Her mother had nothing to say to her in the end other than a letter that was never read.  Haymitch barely got mentioned once they were back in 12. Johanna had no ending.  Peeta should have had plenty to say after what he went through and how Katniss treated him but there was nothing there to reward the readers in the end there, either.  Also, the character of Katniss ended up doing pretty much nothing with her life after she stopped being the Mockingjay.  Did her life peak at the age of sixteen and after that she did nothing that was meaningful?  It seemed she married Peeta because he never left her side and had children for him because it was what he wanted...not her.  In the end, she became this hollow shell compared to the girl her took her sister's place in The Hunger Games.  She became her mother whom she hated so much in the beginning for \\"losing it\\".  I didn't even understand why Peeta would want to stay with her in the end.  She was nothing like the \\"Girl on Fire\\" that he and Gale fell in love with.      After I read this book I could not stop thinking about it.  I couldn't decide if I even liked it or not.  I was glad she chose Peeta in the end but that was all I was happy about.  I had problems shaking off my feelings of depression.  The book itself was depressing but I finally figured out my depression came from how drastically different this book was from the other two.  It changed from a story about a unique character put into an impossible situation (Hunger Games and the war),deciding between two equally great men and instead changed into a lame After School Special on how war is bad.  I already know this.  What I wanted to know was how someone as great as Katniss would handle it.  I never found that out because the character that I fell in love with never showed up in this book.
1416511946|5.0|I've been fan of Motley Crue going on 6 years now.  Not a long period of time I know, but I'm only 20 years old.  But none the less I'm a huge fan of the Crue and Nikki Sixx.  I just got this book for Christmas and have already finished it after only 3 days of reading.  Needless to say I was blown away by this book.  Nikki has quite literally been to hell and back.  He's lived more than twice the life anyone of us will ever live, and is alive to tell the tale.  Nikki Sixx is a big idol of mine and to many others, I'm really glad he made this book, it is simply incredible.  This is a must have for any die hard Crue fan.
142311339X|5.0|I have in my life read a LOT of genre fiction - along with my more serious reading - and as a parent plenty of \\"young adult\\" fiction. And while both genre fiction and young adult fiction is sometimes unfairly maligned, let's face it, in terms of pure literary values much of it is poor to mediocre. Harry Potter, for all its virtues is ... problematic stylistically, mediocre in terms of character development, and has clunky prose. And there is worse, much worse ... don't get me started on the Eragon books. But Riordan is a genuinely good writer - he's not going to get short listed for the National Book Award any time soon, but he has a solid, literate prose style, and people who appreciate good literature won't have to wince every couple of pages.    Of course, the book has MANY other virtues, but they are set forth very well in other reviews. I thought I'd focus on an aspect of the novel not sufficiently mentioned eslewhere.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The second season i felt was even better than the first if that is even possible. The stories and acting is superb. I highly recommend it.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I liked this film, and had no trouble following the story. My wife also watched it and could follow it, and she's not even much of a sci-fi fan (except star trek and Dr. Who) and we even discussed it later. I would recommend this to anyone, and this comes from someone who had taken literally ages trying to make up his mind whether to buy it or not. Now I am glad I did.     The only reason I gave it 4 starts was because of the bonus DVD with extras. What extras? We got a long long discussion (something like 1-1/2 hours I think) about dreaming from several actors and the music tracks. (Although they were good to listen to). The other extras were pretty much just drawings and sketches of the movie concept and stuff. What I would have loved to see in the 'extras' was how they made the movie, how they put it together. There was really none of that. Quite disappointing in the bonus DVD.
0439023521|5.0|This is a great book.  I'm 29 years old with no kids and I LOVE it and will be telling all my reading buddies they MUST read this series.  I'm trying to think of ways to get enough copies to have my 8th grade class read this book, (I need 25 copies, if you're feeling giving).  They wouldn't be able to stop!    READ THIS BOOK!!

B003X2O6KW|5.0|Kanye came into this album with three greats behind him (College Dropout, Late Registration, Graduation). While 808s and Heartbreaks certainly WASN'T great, this album wouldn't be possible without it. Kanye is rapping better than ever before. While no one is ever going to confuse him with Marvin Gaye, Billy Stewart, or R. Kelly, Kanye doesn't push his voice to places it can't go and for that reason, his singing is an effective change of pace. The production is out of this world. There are moments of the chipmunk soul mostly associated with College Dropout. \\"Power,\\" in its anthemic grandeur, reminds the listener of \\"Jesus Walks.\\" Orchestral and electronic influences reminiscent of Late Registration and Graduation weave their way into the mix as well. \\"Devil In a New Dress\\" comes off like a distorted reflection of DJ Drama and Lil Wayne's \\"This What I Call Her.\\" Auto-Tune appears, but doesn't overwhelm anything nor does it serve as a crutch. 808s and Heartbreaks manifests itself in the album's distortions (vocals, drums, samples) and these bits of ugliness, dirtiness, or grime mirror the subject matter.         Did I mention the guest list? John Legend, Kid Cudi, Raekwon, Nicki Minaj, Prince Cy Hi, Swizz Beatz, and the Rza make appearances. Bon Iver, Rick Ross, Jay-Z, and Pusha T all appear twice. Remember Kanye revitalizing Twista's career and putting Lupe Fiasco on the map? Let's hope a few more people hear Pusha T and The Clipse (whose Hell Hath No Fury has been horribly slept on) now that they've heard P show up typically awesome in the spotlight of a Kanye guest spot. And the list of outside help is really a lot bigger; from No I.D. to Elton John, the help was clearly welcome.         Here's the point: No one has EVER made an album like this before and Kanye has never made one this consistently great. Don't miss it.
0307704610|1.0|Beware!  I gave this book a 1 star review.  My review was attacked immediately by several people who seemed at first to be true fans of the book.  After investigation I found that several of them had profiles with ONLY 5 star reviews of this book, along with negative attacks on anyone who wrote a 1 star review.  I found it disturbing, and I'm questioning if they are real people or fake avatars.    My review was removed today, it seems.  Beware the reviews!  It seems that 1 star reviews are attacked and removed, while a mysterious 100+ 5 star reviews all popped on the site on the same day.    If you purchase this book as a 'read', well then no problem.  If you have ANY illusions that this book is a \\"GUIDE\\" as it states in the title, and you plan on using it to lose weight, gain muscle, or have 'incredible sex' there are many different books on the market better suited.  This book is one man's testimonial to the extreme abuse he put himself through.  Ferriss' loopholes (such as the REGAIN of muscle, touted as GAIN) are misleading and dangerous for the average lay person.    Buyer beware!
B001O22ELQ|1.0|If I were simply rating the entertainment value of the music, it would be 5/5 easily.  However, I feel compelled to rate this 1/5 due to the terrible video quality, as well as the terrible user experience provided by Amazon.    The video quality when streamed or played through Unbox is unacceptable for a $5 video.  The video quality is, at best, on par with Youtube (which is free).  The download, when played through Unbox on Windows is equally poor.    However, when played through Windows Media Player, the quality is a bit better.  Unfortunately, there are still plenty of encoding artifacts (which I would expect in a free video, but not in a video I payed for).  Some of these are extremely noticeable, especially near the end of the musical.  Also, if you were hoping to play the video with your favorite non-WMP video player, you're out of luck, due to the DRM scheme used by Amazon.    So, overall, if you are fine paying $5 to download a ~850MB file to watch a mediocre quality copy of a great musical, go ahead and get it.  But if you can find a copy elsewhere, that's probably a better bet.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|With vocal finesse, musical savvy and raw emotion, Annie Lennox restores verve and snap to the Christmas story, which has been so sanitized, romanticized and dumbed-down by modern sensibilities (cute baby, clean hay, cooing mother, nothing disturbing), we forget just how shocking and powerful the original telling in the Gospels is (unwed woman, suspect pregnancy, homeless couple, stinky stable, mass infanticide). Thank heavens for this album, a beautifully and thoughtfully crafted antidote, drawn from longstanding, classical tradition, to all the musical pap that usually assaults us at Christmastide, depriving us of the full breadth and depth of the Christmas story and just how shocking God's debut amid the human race is. Kudos to you, Annie, for producing a rich musical feast that really captures the spirit and invites us to plumb the depths of spirituality in a world not very much different, or any more inviting or accommodating, than the one the Christ Child was born into two millennia ago. Thank you, Annie: this work of yours is simply inspirational, running the gamut from exhilaration to quiet reflection to pathos, as found in the original Christmas story. It's deservedly destined to be a bold, brave landmark in this genre.
B0047CTO9A|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my little sister, She say's it's and okay album not bad at all. She says the album kinda falls in the R&b/Pop genre...

B000W746GK|5.0|Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is an excellent book and also an amazing movie. Unlike some of the newer HP movies, this movie isn't boring. Aside from the 7th movie, this one is one of my favorites.
0385333846|3.0|There are good and bad points to this book... overall I found it a bit overrated and the prose throughout the book was mediocre not my favorite voice or way to read a story.    The story telling was disjointed and a little boring in the beginning.  The voice was detached which helps the reader feel nothing about all the bad things happening in the story. Which could be a good thing.  What I particularly disliked is the author making fun of prayer and the Bible.  It is always in bad taste to poke fun at what other people hold sacred. So this was a big turn off.    Also, the phrase \\"and so it goes\\" was so overused I felt like throwing up everytime I read it and thinking to myself... \\"please please dont make me read this damned phrase again.\\"    This book presented some interesting ideas and ways of looking at things.  For one, I got to learn about the Dresden bombing which prior to this I had never even heard of. Looking at time as a whole instead of in chunks like we are trained to do and thinking about the fourth dimension... that was all interesting stuff.  But the idea I found most useful to take away from this book would have to be \\"Vy me? Vy me?  Vy anybody?\\"  that was said by a German soldier.  I now know what to answer when someone asks \\"Why Me?\\"  LOL.    I probably wouldn't recommend this book to a friend, but it was an easy read and quite informative.  Also, it seems the author is depressed and finds life pointless.... which is nothing new or worth writing about. :)  I think its a stretch to call this a classic or a must read. Except maybe to say you've read it and to know why you, indeed.
B003DT19F0|5.0|I have never written a review before this one and after seeing this movie, I felt it was time. We have the first two Tinkerbell movies and I thought they were well written, had great animation and a storyline with a lot of heart. A lot of the movies out there for children have very mean characters, use words that in a \\"G\\" rated movie I feel are inappropriate and wouldn't want my children repeating, and or focus too much of the movie on the mean characters. This being said, I have been very pleased as are both my children one a boy (age 4) and my daughter (age 5)with all three of the Tinkerbell movies. This movie had a lot of heart, was funny and shows children the value of friendship. I would recommend this to any parent who feels a children's movie should have a positive, fun-loving, and funny storyline. My children had asked to watch this again as soon as it ended!!! Two thumbs way up!
B002WJI65S|4.0|My 9 year old son was absolutely thrilled to get the Goomba plush from Santa Claus this year.  Goomba's eyebrows did not survive the day, however, as they are made of felt and ripped off quite easily.  This did not bother my son in the least and he is still thrilled with Goomba and can't wait to show him off to friends at school.
030746363X|1.0|I don't think the authors suggestions are anything a normal person could make a long term commitment to.  He himself seems to jump from one thing to another.  One chapters suggestions seem to contradict those in another chapter.  His \\"Slow Carb Diet\\" is eat nothing other then eat lean meat, vegetables and beans for 6 days (no fruit and no dairy whatsoever) and then you can eat whatever you want on day 7 and lose weight.  No duh.  I'm not sure how severe restrictions and then completely gorging yourself can be healthy long term either, but then again, it doesn't appear from the language of the book he has maintained any of this theories for more then a few weeks at a time either.  His exercise advice includes doing squats and planks to tone up and get into shape - not sure how this is revolutionary??  Nothing new here and what is different is ridiculous.  I'm disappointed and would not recommend this book for anyone who is serious about getting healthy.
B003UESJH4|5.0|importance. I knew as soon as I was aware of this movie, The King's Speech, I'd have to go & see it, asap. So I did. Coincidently I'd just finished the book, The Reluctant King  (also reviewed). Quite an excellent book on the whole life of George VI & of interest to any Anglophile. In any case, this movie is quite the best I've seen in a decade. The Prince of York  (Colin Firth) second in line to a the British throne had a severe stutter. It did not become a major problem until it became obvious that because of his elder brother's personal problems he would succeed to king. The majority of the film is given over to his sessions with a an Australian therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). His manner with his royal majesty is decidedly informal as his insists on calling the now future king, Bertie & in turn being called Lionel. He feels this puts them on equal footing & he can talk to the king frankly. This just isn't done! But the king relents in the privacy of their sessions. Mr. Logue feels the stuttering is not a physical problem & probes into the kings private life & recollections of childhood. This intrusion by an outsider infuriates the king. Interestingly he does not stutter when he loses his temper or curses.That is used to humorous effect as Mr, Logue eggs on the king to the most vulgar expletives in the loudest voice possible. Helen Bonham Carter has a large role as is wonderful as the Queen consort Elizabeth. She is of course, the mother of the current Queen Elizabeth II. For all who appreciate good historical drama with a bit of humor. The acting all around is simply the best. Academy Awards? I'd say Mr. Firth & Ms Bonham Carter must be considered as best actor & actress, with Mr. Rush as supporting actor. This movie itself could very well carry off the Oscar as the best picture of the year.

If you felt a lack of options for the core classes from the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition, taking balance into account and options of what to do in and out of battle (in case of 4th edition), give Pathfinder a chance: you will fell very familiar with its system.
B00000ILBK|5.0|Star Trek: Insurrection plays a lot like an unusually long episode of the original TNG series - for some (myself included) this is a good thing, but for others it is a source of disappointment.  The television series was popular for good reason, so I can't see the reinvoking of that atmosphere as a bad thing, especially following on the heels of the rather dark Star Trek: First Contact.  All of the cast seem to be enjoying themselves here, and the film still has plenty of great special effects (all digital, by the way) on land as well as in space - and I think the story is quite good, as well.  Best of all, there's no over-the-top buffoonery such as Data trying to function with his emotions implant installed.  It's true that this film does open with a Data malfunction, but there's nothing remotely silly about it, as it sets the stage for the crew of the Enterprise to defy the orders of a Starfleet admiral.<br /><br />After receiving a communication informing him that Lt. Commander Data has gone berserk while helping observe the inhabitants of an alien world, Picard and the Enterprise head into an area of space dubbed the Briar Patch to capture Data and find out what went wrong.  Ignoring all of his Starfleet protocols, Data had revealed the presence of a joint Federation and Son'a taskforce to the Ba'ku people, refused to let team members leave the planet, and even fired upon the starship carrying the Son'a captain and Admiral Matthew Dougherty of Starfleet.  Clearly charmed by the nature of the Ba'ku and their peaceful nature, Picard refuses Admiral Dougherty's order to leave the system until he finds out what is really going on there.  The increasingly evident rejuvenating effects among crew members of time spent on the planet give him a pretty good clue.  What Picard ultimately discovers is a conspiracy that leads him and his officers to defy orders and commit themselves to defending the planet's people and culture from exploitation by the Son'a and Federation central command.<br /><br />When the Son'a aren't getting their old and decrepit skin stretched by weirdly alluring alien females, they are grouching about the Federation bureaucracy that keeps getting in the way of their getting what they want.  The Son'a aren't' that intimidating at first glance, but F. Murray Abraham does a great job of giving the race a sinister edge through his performance as Son'a leader Ru'afo - he even gives vent to what is possibly the second most memorable scream in Star Trek franchise history.  The Ba'ku, in turn, are epitomized by the graceful and elegant Anji (Donna Murphy), a woman whose charms are not lost on Captain Picard.  I think Michael Piller's script doesn't get the respect it deserves, as it tells quite a good story that includes a nice little surprise or two along the way - and lends itself to philosophical debate for any viewers so inclined.  Star Trek: Insurrection may not have the extra wow factor some seem to expect in a Star Trek motion picture, but it plays out like a delightful reunion of characters from a show that millions of us loved.  That is more than enough to satisfy this TNG fan.mmand.

B003UBTX7C|3.0|At some point every series begins to decline, and this book is the beginning of that descent.  In each of the previous Camel Club books, the story flowed well and the twists and turns were unexpected.  With the exception of how the ending was presented, this one appeared evident all the while. Wait for it in paperback (or the equivalent lower Kindle price).
B003BVK2ZS|4.0|Any bibliophile is going to automatically be drawn to this title.  My personal love for books is more than evident to anyone finding his/her way into my home.  This isn't the story of a true book lover, though; it's the story of a criminal who steals valuable, collectible books in an attempt to improve his self-image and define himself as a cultured man of leisure.  He doesn't love books in and of themselves - just the way a shelf of rare old titles on the shelf makes him feel.  While his type of criminality may not be common, John Gilkey is nothing but a common criminal - a fact which the author sometimes seems to forget.  I thought this book was supposed to be about the efforts of Salt Lake City book dealer/ book detective Ken Sanders to identify the man responsible for a growing number of book thefts on the West Coast, but Sanders ultimately gets short shrift in this book.  Apart from stepping up and taking on the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America (ABAA) security job no one before him would do and thus creating a network to communicate the specifics of stolen titles among rare book sellers, Sanders has a diminishing role in a story that becomes more and more about John Gilkey and the author's relationship with him.  I suspect that Sanders' stern rebuke of some of her investigative tactics has something to do with this.<br /><br />I will admit a bias against the manner in which author Allison Hoover Bartlett chose to tell this story.  I really don't like to see an author make herself an important player in a story rather than just telling the story in an objective manner - I think it calls into question the author's true intentions and thus hurts the author's credibility.  Bartlett doesn't just interview Gilkey; at one point, she actually accompanies the man into rare book stores he has robbed in the past - and when Gilkey reveals knowledge of potentially unsolved crimes, she looks for excuses not to report them.  While she may not have done anything wrong legally, I clearly view Bartlett as an ethically-challenged writer.<br /><br />I should point out that Gilkey obtained his books via bad checks and credit card fraud - nothing so exciting as sneaking a Kerouac first-edition into his pants and sidling out the front door with it (although there is reason to believe he has physically stolen books from libraries before).  What sets him apart from other thieves is the fact that he does not steal books to profit monetarily from them (although he has tried to sell a stolen book here or there when he needs money for such things as bail).  Acquiring rare books makes him feel important and cultured, and he clearly does not think he is doing anything wrong.  What is wrong, according to Gilkey's warped mind, is the fact that he doesn't have the money to actually buy what he wants.  Clearly, he will never stop what he is doing; he has already served time on several occasions, and every time he has gotten out of prison he has fallen back on his old criminal ways.  Seemingly, a desperate need for attention is the only reason he would cooperate so fully with the author of this book.<br /><br />The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is certainly an interesting read, and I particularly appreciate the insight it gave me into the business of rare and collectible book sales.  Sadly, however - whether or not it was her intention - I cannot help but feel that Bartlett has glorified a two-bit con man in these pages.legally, I clearly view Bartlett as an ethically-challenged writer.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought this piece of crap for $75 after tax , $10 off at target . Every review on this item I read and watch on youtube claim that this is the best headphone , I for one disagree. After wearing it for 3hrs , my ears hurt.  I tried to return it , unfortunately I was unable to do that due to Target no return policy.  So in my conclusion , With a $75+ price tag , not worth it. Save your money and get a better head phone.
B001UV4XFG|2.0|I normally do not write reviews but I feel so necessary to put my thoughts on paper to get my frustration out.  First of, I'm a new fan to the twilight saga.  I watched Twilight to see what all the hype was about.  I know I'm a little behind all the diehard fans but I wanted to check it out.  The movie was terrible.  The dialog and the acting on Kristen Stewart's part were just horrendous to watch.  I told my friends this and they urged me to read the books because it is so much better.  After I read the 1st book, I was hooked!  I got the other 3 books and was just obsessed over the books.  I guess it would be too much to expect the movie to emulate the book exactly but come on...it is so way off.  The first Twilight movie was actually very painful to watch comparing to the book.  The part where Bella told Edward that she knew he was a vampire was so endearing and touching in the book and they totally butchered it in the movie version.  It actually looked really stupid in the movie.  This is after all a love story and they took most of the love part out of the movie.  It was really disappointing.  Then I watched New Moon, it was a little better than Twilight but still left off a lot of dialog from the book that should be included.  Then the 3rd movie, a little better than the other two but at the end of the movie, I long to read the books again.  The movie is nothing compared to the books.  I know the movie would be like 5 hours long if it follows the book exactly but if you are going to take things out, that's fine but don't change the entire thing.  The part where Edward confronted Jacob for kissing Bella, in the book, it was just loving and so protective.  In the movie, it was dumb and so childish.  I just hope Breaking Dawn will be better and they will keep most of what is in the book and translate it into the movie.  Since they are making 2 parts for Breaking Dawn, should be plenty of timing to allow this.  Maybe down the road, someone else might do a remake ofthe entire this and it will be much better.  I just don't know how Stephenie Meyer would allow the movie to be made like this when her books are so much better.  They need to get rid of the screenwriter and maybe have Stephenie write the script.

0062515675|3.0|I have to say that the foundation of what this book is based upon is quite solid and it is a tried and tested formula that appeals and appears to work for people. I think that is great!    I did find the writing a little forced and a bit 'gee-golly-whizz' at times - but you get over that too. This is where we wish we could find ourselves between Paulo Coehlo and Kahlil Gibrain's 'The Prophet'. It's similar territory and useful information - but the packaging was not to my personal taste. That said, I am quite sure that many people will get a LOT of good out of this book. I know I will, despite my niggling dislikes about the delivery. I know it needs to be simple and easy to digest, but it was a little patronizing at times in its use of language.    As I said before and will say again, however, the message is a good one. So if you can overcome stilted prose you are onto a life-changing aid...
B003EI2EH2|4.0|Tim Ferris is all about getting results.  He has done a lot of self-experimentation and tried all sorts of things to figure out what works best for losing fat, gaining muscle, healing injuries and generally getting your body to perform at it's peak.      The book itself is a little different than most.  It's not meant to be read cover to cover, instead it's more like a \\"choose your adventure\\" style book where you skip from chapter to chapter reading what's relevant to you.  I've chosen a few of his ideas to integrate into my diet and workout regimen and I'll probably add some more and evaluate how they work for me.      Tim's writing style is a little annoying to me.  He's a name-dropper and most chapters begin with an anecdote like \\"I was having lunch with <famous person> at <famous restaurant> and ...\\"  But so far I've been able to get past that and find useful information among the bragging and self-promotion.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Very, very good book.  However, I wish I would have read the first two before I read this one.  The background knowledge would have been helpful.  I still found the story/plot compelling and had a hard time putting the book down.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|This mini-series was the perfect solution to yesterday's snow day. I went into the viewing expecting Band of Brothers- Pacific edition. This was not really the case. The Pacific is far more character driven than B of B. I was a little disappointed by the introduction of interesting characters that then disappear to bring in new ones. I enjoyed this mini-series immensely; just wish there had been more consistency with pacing and character development.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is simply my favorite war movie/series ever (I say that as a fan of Band of Brothers).  Unbelievably well done in terms of realism.  Every detail thought through.  CGI is so seamless that I re-watched many parts because I was trying to figure out if the scene used any computer effect...I couldn't tell!    I am ex-military, so realism is paramount to me...and this series delivers it like no other.    Amazing in Blu-ray.  I can not recommend more highly.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|When I first purchased \\"Black Christmas\\", I did not immediately watch it.  I was intrigued from reviews and have been a consistent fan of the horror genre.  When I first watched it, it seemed slow.  I did not pay much attention and wrote it off as an \\"alright\\" DVD.  I was very wrong.  When I watched it a second time one winter night in December, I was scared out of my wits.  If you've watched this movie and found it slow-moving, WATCH IT AGAIN.  It is truly a gem.    The opening scene depicts a Tudor-style sorority house blanketed in snow and Christmas lights.  \\"Silent Night, Holy Night\\" is playing in the background and you see the main character Jess (played by Olivia Hussey from 1968's 'Romeo & Juliet' fame) entering the front door of the house.  The camera pans above the front door to see that it is framed by the old, Charlie Brown-type multi-colored Christmas lights (the film was made in 1974 afterall) and we see the bustle inside as the camera moves from window to window, decorated with red, blue, & green stars.  Everyone in the sorority house is getting ready for the Christmas recess and it is busy with the girls preparing to leave.  We also see an \\"unknown\\" stranger from his POV (ripped off by John Carpenter for 'Halloween') climb an outside trellis attached to the house and enter an attic window.      The suspense of the movie slowly builds with the periodic prank calls from a stranger that the girls nickname \\"The Moaner\\".  The calls are juvenile, obsene, and profanity-laced with the caller coming off as disturbingly insane.  One-by-one girls start to go missing and we see them being murdered by the unseen stranger in the attic.  When \\"good girl\\" Claire (played by Lynne Griffin who also has another small, memorable role in 'The Amateur') is suffocated in plastic wrap, the viewer finds themselves in rapt attention.  Each time the phone rings, your heart quickens.    Throughout the film, the characters are defined and interlaced with the suspense.  Olivia Hussey's Jess comes across as a quiet, kind girl that seems to maintain great composure and control in the face of a terrifying situation.  A young Margot Kidder (pre-'Superman') is the wise-cracking party girl Barb and Andrea Martin (SCTV fame) is the nerdy sweet Phyl.  Mrs. Mac adds humor as the closet drunk housemother, but does come off as a bit annoying and lacking credibility as a housemother.  John Saxon is wonderful as the police officer assigned to the case and Keir Dullea does a fine turn as Jess' eccentric pianist boyfriend.    \\"Black Christmas\\" will quickly become a viewing Christmas tradition that will put a twist in your holiday season.  As the tagline says \\"And all through the house a creature was stirring....\\"  INDEED.

The plots ok but Hal Holbrook is this old guy who keeps coming  up with ho-hum platitdes referring to his moralistic ideas of approaches to stock market  investment which make one want to throw up.      The most interesting true story ever related to stocks is the life story of Jesse Livermore.  Livermore was a poor farm boy who left home at 15 with 5.00 his mother gave him.     20 years later, after learning to trade, he eventually made 100 million shorting the 1929 crash.    Now theres movie potential.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|Any movie that opens with a man getting blown in half, tells you that plot is not going to be as important as action. This movie is a ton of fun, and great for kicking back, grabbing a beer, and eating some red meat. It won't be winning awards, unless they create an Oscar for \\"Best Bad @$$ Film\\", but it's definitely worth watching.
1594488843|5.0|Some books for me are \\"game changers.\\" All of Malcolm Gladwell's books fall into this category: \\"Tipping Point,\\" \\"Blink\\" and \\"Outliers.\\" Frans Johansson's \\"The Medici Effect\\" prompted me to organize two leadership gatherings: The White Rhino Intersection and Intersection 2.0. Daniel Pink's latest book, \\"Drive,\\" belongs in this same category. I love what Gladwell said about Pink's book: \\"I spent as much time thinking about what this book means as I did reading it.\\" Well said; I have had the same response.<br /><br />To regular readers of The White Rhino Report, Pink is no stranger. I wrote effusively about his earlier book, \\"A Whole New Mind.\\"<br /><br />I recently offered a link to a TED talk that summarizes the most salient points of \\"Drive.\\"<br /><br />Having been thoroughly mesmerized and intrigued by the \\"Drive\\" video, I wondered if I needed to read the book. I am glad I chose to take that additional step. The video serves as an excellent appetizer and introductory tool, but the main nutrient's can be found in the book.<br /><br />Pink's genius is his ability to take previously published research from a variety of fields, synthesize and coordinate the data and present the findings to a lay audience in a way that does not \\"dumb down\\" the content or the significance of the discoveries. He takes the \\"what,\\" and turns it into a powerful \\"so what?\\".<br /><br />In discussing what motivates individuals and teams in almost any setting, Pink describes two types of motivation: Type X (extrinsic) and Type I (intrinsic).<br /><br />\\"Type I behavior is a renewable resource. Think of Type X behavior as coal, and Type I behavior as the sun. For most of recent history, coal has been the cheapest, easiest, most efficient resource. But coal has two downsides. First, it produces nasty things like air pollution and greenhouse gases. Second, it's finite; getting more of it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive each year. Type X behavior is similar. An emphasis on rewards and punishments spews its own externalities. And 'if-then' motivators always grow more expensive. But Type I behavior, which is built around intrinsic motivation, draws on resources that are easily replenished and inflict little damage. It is the motivational equivalent of clean energy: inexpensive, safe to use, and endlessly renewable.\\" (Page 80)<br /><br />He goes on to describe what lies at the heart of Type I behavior and the underlying motivations. He issues what amounts to a manifesto for change.<br /><br />\\"Ultimately, Type I behavior depends upon three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. and it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose. Some might dismiss notions like these as gooey and idealistic, but the science says otherwise. The science confirms that this sort of behavior is essential to being human - and that now, in a rapidly changing economy, it is also critical for professional, personal, and organizational success of any kind. So we have a choice. We can cling to a view of human motivation that is grounded more in old habits than in modern science. Or we can listen to the research, drag our business and personal practices into the twenty-first century, and craft a new operating system to help ourselves, our companies, and our world work a little better. It won't be easy. It won't happen overnight. So let's get started.\\" (Pages 80-81)<br /><br />As the author continues to sketch out the components of what he calls Motivation 3.0 - a large quantum leap beyond the traditional Motivation 2.0 that fueled the Industrial Revolution - he describes four aspects of autonomy.<br /><br />\\"And what a few future-looking businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy - in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with. As Atlassian's experience shows, Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four T's: their task, their time, their technique, and their team.\\" (Pages 93-94)<br /><br />In discussing the importance of \\"Purpose\\" as a factor in motivation, Pink's work comes close to the themes of the book \\"Half Time - Moving from Success to Significance,\\" by Bob Buford, which I reviewed in this space a few months ago:<br /><br />These themes are also resonant with Rick Warren's best-seller, \\"The Purpose Driven Life.\\"<br /><br />The demographic time bomb that is my generation of Baby Boomers presents an interesting dilemma and opportunity occasioned by our anticipated increased longevity.<br /><br />\\"Upon comprehending that they could have another twenty-five years, sixty-year-old boomers look back twenty-five years - to when they were thirty-five - and a sudden thought clonks them on the side of the head. 'Wow. That sure happened fast,' they say. 'Will the next twenty-five years race by like that? If so, when I am going to do something that matters? When am I going to live my best life? When am I going to make a difference in the world?'<br /><br />Those questions, which swirl through conversations taking place at boomer kitchen tables around the world, may sound touch-feely. But they're now occurring at a rate that is unprecedented in human civilization. Consider: Boomers are the largest demographic cohort in most western countries, as well as in places like Japan, Australia and New Zealand. . . In America alone, one hundred boomers turn sixty every thirteen minutes. When the cold front of demographics meets the warm front of unrealized dreams, the result will be a thunderstorm of purpose the likes of which the world has never seen.\\" (Pages 132-133)<br /><br />In my observation, the impact is even more dramatic than that which Pink describes. In my role as a career coach, life coach, recruiter and mentor to many emerging leaders, men and women are beginning to ask the \\"purpose question\\" at increasingly younger ages. This bodes well for our future, and will force companies to address this issue if they hope to survive and to attract and to retain top talent.<br /><br />The purpose dynamic has another aspect to it. In the absence of working for a higher purpose, Type X high achievers - the classic \\"Type A\\" personalities - work longer and longer hours to achieve material success and promotion. The result is burnout and dissatisfaction.<br /><br />\\"One of the reasons for anxiety and depression in the high attainers in that they're not having good relationships. They're busy making money and attending to themselves, and that means that there's less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count.\\" (Page 144)<br /><br />In the title of this review, I call this book a \\"Must Read,\\" yet the book is not for everyone. I recommend it to you only if you meet the following criteria:<br /><br />  * You are a life-long learner who is willing to learn new facts and to change your thinking and behavior in accordance with these new insights.<br />  * You are in a position of leadership - in a company, in the military, in a family, in a school, in an organization - in which you need to and desire to create an environment of work and learning that maximizes autonomy, mastery, and purpose.<br />  * You want to make a positive difference in the world and in the lives of those whom you influence.<br /><br />If this is you, then order this book now, devour it, breath it, taste it, smell it, talk about it and live it.

'Wow. That sure happened fast,' they say. 'Will the next twenty-five years race by like that? If so, when I am going to do something that matters? When am I going to live my best life? When am I going to make a difference in the world?'<br /><br />Those questions, which swirl through conversations taking place at boomer kitchen tables around the world, may sound touch-feely. But they're now occurring at a rate that is unprecedented in human civilization. Consider: Boomers are the largest demographic cohort in most western countries, as well as in places like Japan, Australia and New Zealand. . . In America alone, one hundred boomers turn sixty every thirteen minutes. When the cold front of demographics meets the warm front of unrealized dreams, the result will be a thunderstorm of purpose the likes of which the world has never seen.\\" (Pages 132-133)<br /><br />In my observation, the impact is even more dramatic than that which Pink describes. In my role as a career coach, life coach, recruiter and mentor to many emerging leaders, men and women are beginning to ask the \\"purpose question\\"at increasingly younger ages. This bodes well for our future, and will force companies to address this issue if they hope to survive and to attract and to retain top talent.<br /><br />The purpose dynamic has another aspect to it. In the absence of working for a higher purpose, Type X high achievers - the classic \\"Type A\\" personalities - work longer and longer hours to achieve material success and promotion. The result is burnout and dissatisfaction.<br /><br />\\"One of the reasons for anxiety and depression in the high attainers in that they're not having good relationships. They're busy making money and attending to themselves, and that means that there's less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count.\\" (Page 144)<br /><br />In the title of this review, I call this book a \\"Must Read,\\" yet the book is not for everyone.

B0043KK4N6|5.0|I saw the movie and was completely enthralled with it the minute I walked out of the theater. I ordered the CD and it is AWESOME. Most of the songs make you want to get up and dance, and two of them are heartfelt, but also great. Highly recommend if you like Etta James style music with an up to date twist!! A must for long-standing Christina fans. :)
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Christie Collins' son goes missing, and when the LA Police Department claims that he is \\"found\\" and the case is closed, Christie sets out to expose the policemen's negligence. She gets much more than she bargained for, and also finds out about a separate police case that might lead her to the whereabouts of her boy.<br /><br />This is a chilling but TRUE story. After watching the movie, I was so interested in the details that I went to look up the true story myself. A city even changed its name in real life to avoid association with events that were portrayed in the movie! Angelina Jolie plays a convincing role as the single mother who wouldn't stop until she could find out about her son. Her supporting characters are pretty good as well. Most viewers will find the police in the story morally repugnant, will hate them and will be waiting for them to be torn apart in the film.<br /><br />No scene in the movie makes a reference to the title, but I looked it up anyway. A changeling is a creature posing as a child to replace the actual child that was taken away by a mythological creature. This is sort of an appropriate title for the movie, but another title relating to the corruption, politics, or any of the other major drama in the film would have been fine too. Either way, the movie is worth watching!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have always been a fan of Pride and Prejudice, so when I saw this movie I decided to buy it for christmas. This movie stuck very close to the book, and used several lines directly from it which is awesome for those of us who are huge fans. I highly suggest that anyone who is a fan of Austen's to buy this!
0385342047|2.0|I, for one, missed Becky Brandon (née Bloomwood ) and was looking forward to reading this latest installment in the Shopaholic series. But what a letdown! Becky has always been quirky, but her antics in this book were a little too much for my tastes.     The last time we saw Becky, she and her husband Luke were ecstatic about the birth of their first child, a daughter they named Minnie. This book begins two years later, with preparations for Minnie's christening. Even though Minnie is now an active toddler, Becky and Brandon still haven't chosen a middle name for their daughter or had her properly christened. Minnie is spoiled beyond belief and out of control. She runs around grabbing things that don't belong to her and yells, \\"Miiiine!!!\\" a lot. Minnie's christening turns out to be a disaster and Luke can't even attend. So Becky decides to hold another christening a few months later, unbeknownst to Luke, and make it a christening/surprise birthday party for Luke. But then the reverend suddenly arrives at Becky's parents' house and baptizes Minnie on the spot, so the big party turns into a huge birthday fete for Luke. The rest of the book focuses on Becky's trials and tribulations as the big day draws near. The lengths Becky goes to hide the party from Luke are ridiculous. Becky has gotten into a lot of crazy situations in the past, but this time, everything is over-the-top and I found her behavior silly and not the least bit funny.     A lot of reviewers object to the fact that Becky has never outgrown her shopaholic ways. But that doesn't bother me in the least. After all, if Becky no longer had a shopping addiction, then there would be no more Shopaholic books, right? In fact, I was looking forward to a lot of mother-daughter shopping trips. However, Minnie isn't really a big part of the action. But that's because she's too young to do all that much--she doesn't even speak in complete sentences yet. The book takes place from December 2005 to April 2006, when Minnie is only 2. The author could have easily solved this problem by moving the action forward a few years and making Minnie a little older. Personally, I was never crazy about the character of Luke. He always seemed a little arrogant and aloof to me. But the birth of his daughter seems to have mellowed him and he's now a lot less uptight... although I don't think that a loner like Luke would have been the least bit happy with the ostentatious party that Becky throws for him (it seems that all of Britain--even the royal family--wishes him a happy birthday!). Surprisingly, the most interesting person in the book turns out to be Luke's estranged mother, Elinor. The scenes with Elinor and little Minnie are poignant, and I actually found myself feeling sorry for Elinor, who had previously been portrayed as the Wicked Witch of mothers/mothers-in-law.     Although the book seems to go on and on and on (I think a good 100 pages could have easily been cut out), the conclusion leaves a lot of things up in the air. In the end, Becky and Luke still don't have a house to call their own, and Luke hasn't reconciled with his mother. I take this to mean that there is going to be another installment in the series. If there is, I might read it. I'll always like Becky and I never want her to reform completely. But I'd like to see her move beyond all the silly--and ultimately boring--antics she gets into in this book. If not, I'm afraid she is in danger of becoming the British version of Lucy Ricardo.
B0032FPVKE|3.0|I'm sure there are better bags out there for basically the same price. This bag is ok but I'm not all that impressed with the storage design and also it has a double zipper for the main storage flap and one of the zippers doesn't work. The bag seems to have ok material but not quiet enough room for my needs.
B0006ZE7G2|3.0|Being a huge fan of Pink Floyd, like many others, I've always believed that the music of Pink Floyd plays on such a massive sonic landscape, that no amount of time, money, or filmmaking genius could hope to match their enormous scope of vision on the screen. When I first saw The Wall movie, I thought I would be overwhelmed by this effort to elevate Pink Floyd's massive masterwork to visual experience. However, my feelings about the result were mixed. The movie, while filled with all sorts of creative efforts to tell the story of \\"Pink\\" and his downward spiral into madness, comes across as nothing more than a hodgepodge of vignettes with little or no connection to each other. Unless one knows The Wall beforehand, one will be completely lost in following this movie. Watching this movie, I thought of other movies that attempted to bring music albums to life. Two much more successful examples are The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\". These efforts were more successful because they didn't take their respective albums as screenplays for the films. Rather, the albums were inspirations for the films, and the results were far better. In the end, one can only call The Wall movie as a brilliant failure.
B0033QC0WY|3.0|Some of these performances (especially the 5th) are terrific, though I prefer Bernstein's Columbia (Sony) recordings from the 1960s, which seem fresher and have been gorgeously remastered (in 2009?).  Bernstein was planning to complete this cycle for DG with a new performance of the 8th when he died.  The label inserted a 1975 live recording with the Vienna Phil for this box that's just a mess.  In the first movement, the orchestra slips in and out of synch and the architecture of the piece nearly collapses into cacophony by the climax.  I've never heard anything like it (fortunately).  My only other real complaint is the same as another reviewer's: To squeeze everything onto 11 CDs, the sequencing has been played with.  It would have made more sense to put the 2nd, 6th, 8th, 9th onto single discs (they fit!), even if that meant leaving room at the end of the CDs for the 1st and the 4th.  Instead, the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th AND 9th are split across two CDs.  Which is a pain, even for those of us who have the ability to load and program multiple CDs into a changer.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|If you are a fan of Castle and you read this book, you will find that as you digest the pages within, you yearn for these two characters to be Castle and Beckett.  Not at any time did I envision these characters in different ways.  I found myself torn between wanting this book to be the continuation of the story of the characters on the show, vs. a standalone book about Nicki Heat, Castle's creation.  The similarities were too overpowering to disregard.<br /><br />Had I picked this up first, I may have enjoyed it as a stand alone, but after watching the show, I found it to just be a slight knock-off of a really good TV show.<br /><br />I may try to read the next installment, if there is one, but it is doubtful.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I read and read and read, waiting for something to happen and nothing did. Finally I gave up and didn't finish the book. It's totally awash in blood, meaningless wars, characters who have dull conversations. Nothing takes place in an exciting or interesting way. It's kind of like a grown-up Dick and Jane book. Oh, oh, look, look. See the blood, see the war, see the walls falling down, see the mages, see the blue-tinged skin on the lady. Everything is told instead of showing with descriptive words and phrases.<br /><br />I'm a big fantasy fan and I love good fantasy. This is not good fantasy. It's a plodding experience.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned the book is a waste of time and money.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Rated as album of the year by many esteemed magazines throughout the world, Kanye takes you on a whirlwind ride on this new album. I've had it for a month now and still play it all the time!
B0042U94UQ|4.0|We bought this movie for our 2 year old son as a gift and watched it Christmas day. He loved it and we did too. The minions are adorable. Mr. Gru is incredible is both dispicable and loveable at the same time and the plot was well developed enough to entertain both adults and children. I suspect that this is going to be on the frequent play list at our house for months to come.
B003DZX3US|4.0|I bought this movie for my two girls and yhey absolutely love it.  The picture quality is excellent it looks better than ever
B000Z45PEC|4.0|Got this for my son who is a huge Back to the Future fan.  Its pretty neat.  The doors open just like on the movie.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|If you enjoyed the movie you'll love having the soundtrack.  Some of the music is reminiscent of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" which is not a bad thing by any means.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|If you love Community -- Buy the DVD set!  NOW!  The DVD packaging and UX are well done and shouldn't provoke murderous rages.  Buy it NOW
B0046LUTUA|4.0|I purchased the book for as a Christmas gift for my son.  He's very excited to have his hands on it.  I read the first chapter myself and has already drawn into the story.  The book was a good purchase.
0891419063|5.0|Very well written, great point of view by Sledge. This book does not use a lot of profanity to describe the battlefield, however, it is very descriptive.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|My fiance and I loved this movie. And after watching the movie  I immediately ordered the soundtrack from Amazon. I wish Sex Boh-hom was a real band! I'd buy their cd for sure too.   I haven't read the comics but have played the arcade game on PS3. I liked the tie-ins.
B001EN71DQ|3.0|Unfortunately I truly feel that all of the computer animation did the film some injustice. All of the computer graphics really made it feel cheesy and out of sync. The story line itself is great. I completely understand that you have to use some computer animation to create some of the scenery, worlds, and people that are contained within the movie, but it seems that all of the technology butted in on the story line and the characters. Overall, if you are a Star Wars fan, this is a must have. It makes 4,5, and 6 more understandable.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|A lot of Christmas collections are the same old thing.  This collection has a nice mix of the traditional and the unconventional.  This is a very interesting band, and an enjoyable Christmas album.
B003THN75G|4.0|Castle ain't no \\"Wire,\\" or even \\"Firefly,\\" but I doubt anyone is really watching it for that. It is kinda exactly what you think it is - a little campy, predictable, and funny in an obvious, but smart, way - except, it is done very well. I have all the seasons and so far, I haven't gotten tired of it.    So, if that is what you are looking for, this is perfect.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is a must read! I could NOT put it down! I highly recommend this book! Just check out the sample and you'll be hooked like I was. I thought it looked like it might be interesting and got the sample. Then I had to buy it, because it was so intriguing! Definitely will check out more books by this author! :D
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The movie is excellent.    The only minor issue I have is that Amazon shipped it in one of those bubble wrapped envelopes so there was some damage on the blu-ray case (ie one of the latches broke). There was probably nothing Amazon could have really done since I know it's impractical to ship it in a hard box.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|This was my sons favorite movie when he was younger.  I searched all over and finally found it on Amazon.  He opened it on Christmas morning and loved it!!  He hadn't seen it t a very long time.  Thanks, Debbie
B00428CPUY|2.0|not as good as the first two shows... 2004 and 2007... getting kinda old now needa a new host we have seen enough of Bill Murray.  Hope the next one has some different guitar players like maybe Mark Knopfler and Eric Johnson Brad Paisley, and can someone tell Jeff Beck to lift a few weights he has an arm like a 80 year old woman
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Ben Affleck has proven he is an A-lister with this one - both in front of the camera and behind it.  Wow - great movie.  Its been a long time since I've seen a movie that had it all... and this one has it all: action, drama, suspense, a tad bit of comedy, and even a bit of romance.  An outstanding movie that for sure, will be nominated for Best Picture.  If its not, I'm going to stop watching movies.      Nice work Mr. Affleck!  Well done!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Each of us creates our own mythology.  When we start college or begin a new job or we have a baby, it's an adventure, a call to action, a journey into the unknown.  Jack, Kate, Sawyer and the other survivors of Oceanic 815 are all heroes in some way.  And in Season 6 this concept is really driven home, as the survivors continue to try to get off the island and get home.    As we've seen the characters develop in previous seasons through flash-backs and flash-forwards, this season presents a unique flash-sideways that is compelling and causes, as usual, more questions.  Season 6 also holds a lot of answers for LOST fans, too, however.  Who is Richard Alpert?  What kind of relationship is there between Jacob and the Man in Black?  Who are Adam and Eve?    Over the past six seasons, this series has intrigued and inspired.  The writing is clever and very moving.  Ending a series is always sad, since its audience has spent so much time with the characters, getting to know and love them.  Ending this series gives the audience just enough information to answer a few pending questions, but begs them to ultimately look inside themselves, to reflect on their own journeys.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This show is great, the second season is even better than the first. It's pure gold! Neil Patrick Harris is a great character that you will fall in love with and he'll become a role model.
B003DT19F0|5.0|What can I say really, I got the movie my daughter wanted at an AMAZING price (even cheaper then the black Friday price), it came quickly and plays fine. All around perfect purchase!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|All that I hoped for.  My 14 year old son was blown away when he opened it Christmas morning!
B004132HZS|1.0|I'd like to love it but it simply doesn't click for me.     There's no real chemistry between any of the characters, simply what seems to be standard BBC mood lighting (first seen by me in \\"Wire in the Blood\\") and some rather snarky quirks substituting for characterization. And Holmes doesn't seem to be any great shakes as a detective. For example in \\"The Blind Banker\\" Holmes spends most of the episode baffled by the \\"code\\" which are simply Chinese numbers. I recognized them as ideographs right away and certainly something like Google Translate would have given the answer. But a BOOK CODE in the 21'st century? (They've never heard of PPG?) And there was the bit where Watson,supposedly an experienced combat surgeon, goes off and leaves the girl he's supposed to protect alone to be murdered. There is a terribly contrived bit where the villains confuse Watson for Holmes, but only because they look only at selected items in his wallet and they or rather the writers ignore the fact that Watson must have Military ID and a driving license. Not to mention some extraordinary kind of permit for his pistol.    I'm also a bit boggled by what's going to happen when/if SH or JW Google their names and Conan Doyle's most famous creation pops up. Or stroll down Baker Street toward Regent's Park and pass the Sherlock Holmes museum. I'd ignore the paradox if the series were better. :)    Worth watching once and I'd buy it from the Walmart bargain bin. I think it's got potential, but the first three were, IMO, rather bland.     I really hope it gets better. My favorite line:  Sherlock: \\"I'm not a psychopath Anderson, I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.\\"    Unfortunately one liners are simply not enough to carry a Sherlock Holmes series.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma! Naturally, I bought it for my own collection as soon as it was available at a financially reasonable price. The movie itself deserves 5 stars. It is charming and witty, plus it has its funny moments! (Perhaps not as much as Pride and Prejudice, but still...)<br /><br />Sad to say, the way that Emma was put onto DVD was quite disappointing. I hate how the movie is divided into the 4 episode format as it premiered on BBC. It gets annoying after a while to have to skip through the credit interruptions throughout the movie. Why couldn't the film just be all one thing like all of the other Jane Austen films? (i.e. Persuasion, Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice) Why did it have to be different for this movie? This is where I have to give 3 stars.<br /><br />I'm not trying to discourage Jane Austen fans from buying or viewing this movie, but I'm just bracing them for a little surprise or disappointment on how Emma was put onto DVD.
0060507772|5.0|My librarian pointed me toward Terry Pratchett's books a year or so ago and I have enjoyed every one that I've been able to get my hands on. If you like a humorous, irreverent approach to science and magic; if you enjoy satire; if you like being surprised by a twist of phrase, you will enjoy Terry Pratchett's works in general and this one in particular. The artwork by Paul Kidby enhances the story--I HAD been wondering what Mad Hamish and the rest of Cohen, the Barbarian's \\"boys\\" look like and now I know.<br />The storyline is a quest in reverse as Cohen, the Last Hero of Discworld, attempts to return that which the First Hero stole from the Gods. To say more would ruin the story, so I'll leave it at that.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|What adult wants to read a 330-page story told by a five-year-old?  Everyone who ventures onto the first page of Room, a stunner of a novel!<br /><br />Donoghue's child narrator, Jack, grabs readers with his first words, \\"Today I'm Five.\\"  Half the novel is set in a single room where Jack's mother, kidnapped as a teenager, is trapped by a psychopath who rapes her regularly.  Wardrobe is the bedroom where Jack retreats to escape the attention of the kidnapper, his father, whom he calls \\"Old Nick.\\"  The conditions of this life define normalcy for the child protagonist, captive since birth.<br /><br />Jack's mother, \\"Ma,\\" makes their soundproofed, hidden outdoor shed livable and lovable to her boy, for whom Room and its accouterments--Table, Floor, Bowl--are unique entities and Room itself the world.  Mother and son carry out a daily routine of exercise, learning and play designed to maintain Jack's well being.<br /><br />Old Nick's weekly routine is to drop off necessities that Ma requests and to withhold them when she angers him, which she does in a harrowing incident.  Out of spite, he turns off the electricity for a week, and keeps mother and child in the cold without sufficient food.<br /><br />In Room nothing is wasted: empty egg cartons are turned into toys; spoiled food is eaten.  Ma sees to it that her son receives proper clothes and nutrients, as well as books and toys that keep his mind engaged.  She makes up games, runs track around the table, and raises a child who is verbally and mathematically precocious but has no sense of the world at large and lacks such basic skills as depth perception.<br /><br />Through Jack's innocent observations, his mother's mental and physical anguish--her migraines, her depression, her unbearable sense of loss--are keenly felt by the reader. Their escape back into the world is rife with irony and nearly as pernicious as their bondage.  Their experience of freedom evokes the Lovelace verse: \\"Stone walls do not a prison make . . .  minds innocent and quiet take that for an hermitage.\\"ake that for an hermitage.\\"
B003TT2X72|3.0|NO need to review the Movie, thats been done over and over. Reviewing the Blu ray release, this is just another Double Dip edition only the movie was in HD the extra Features were on DVD, if you own the Original DVD buy it but only at a fair price you wont be getting your moneys Worth.. The Blu Ray Transfer was great, besides that theres nothing new. if you are buying for the first time get it, if you trying to upgraded wait for the Extended Editions(or if you can get them for less the $10).

Good Stuff.
0060899220|5.0|Two caveats up front. First off, Anthony Bourdain is not a writer. His prose is basic-to-mediocre, and the text is riddled with typos (although that's as much on the editors as Mr. Bourdain). The second caveat is that this book is unapologetically not for the mass public. Bourdain's real aim in writing was to be authentic to who he is as a cook, communicating with other cooks in language only they will truly understand, although along the way he tosses out some bread crumbs for the lay person. Given these starting points, this is one of the better books I've read in my life.<br /><br />Bourdain is, using the oft-repeated mantra, the Hunter S. Thompson of the cooking world. This is the gonzo journalism of the cooking industry. He's an awful person, and you can tell you'd hate working anywhere near the guy. He's crass, he's foul-mouthed, he tries to sneak in big words to look smart. You will actually hate this guy sometimes, and you'll also likely want to stay away from the restaraunts he's decribing. But then you realize. Bourdain's power as a writer lies in stirring your feelings. You feel revulsion at his life, because he tells the story with painful truth. You hate the man, because he does a very good job communicating what horrible things he's seen and done. You become squeamish about restaraunts, because you can tell the horrors are all too real.<br /><br />And yes, there's a lot of horrors found in this text. People having sex in back rooms, snorting cocain off the bar, shoveling \\"unused\\" bread from one table to the next, and why the Monday fish special is usually a bad idea. This is the truth of the cooking industry, warts and all.<br /><br />Or is it? As many have said, there's a big asterisk on the whole book, partially thanks to the updated edition. Bourdain has recanted a lot of the subservion found in the book. In fact, partly because of this book, you're less likely than most any point in history to be serviced by any kitchen where waiters are spitting in your food or cutting dangerous corners maximizing profit. There's more scrutiny than ever on the cooking industry, and a lot more money flowing, causing standards in today's kitchens to be much higher than at the time of writing.<br /><br />Kitchen Confidential, in some ways, is to the kitchen industry what Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" was to the meat-packing industry. The more terrifying parts of the book are now relics of a bygone era. You might say that this is what the restaraunt industry was, not necessarily what it is. And that's okay.<br /><br />So much like the works of Hunter S. Thompson or Chuck Palahniuk, this book makes you feel. Bourdain's crass writing accomplishes this goal in spades. The additional commentary from Bourdain that the new edition contains will also tell you that Kitchen Confidentail massively surpassed Bourtain's expectations in terms of being true to the cooking world and \\"telling it like it is\\". Will you like this book? I can't tell you that. You might hate this book. You might ignore every word, toss this paperback in the garbage, and return to restaraunt dining with nary a care in the world. Regardless, you have to admit that this book does exactly what the author intended.<br /><br />Recommended enthusiastically to anyone who has ever eaten food.

B003HGKJH8|4.0|The sound on this album is the spawn of some of the most influential people of the 60's.  Tame Impala has taken notes from the fluid and trippy sounds of the 60's era psychedelic movement.  This album sounds like something that the Beatles did with Brian Wilson and then asked the 13th Floor Elevators to chop it apart and put it back together.    Great Musical Experience.  Play it LOUD!!
0439023513|3.0|My friend and I immediately went and got the book the day it was released and automatically began reading it nonstop. The beginning and mid section of the book became gripping as usual, but near the big fight that's supposed to happen, things just get messed up, confusing, frustrating, and yes, stupid. Collins soon didn't even make any sense of what the crap was going on between Katniss and a possessed Peetam, who for some reason, \\"gets back with her.\\" Huh? Where's the details? This book would have sold more and would have gotten better reviews if SHE JUST ADDED DETAILS TO EVERY DANG THING!!! If you are a die hard Hunger Games fan, continue reading if you want, but I warn you, disappointments are sure to come your way. And don't come crying to me.
B0042MDAL8|1.0|This is ONLY the movie, NO extra features at all (not even for digital download). I pre-ordered to get it on release day... which Amazon DOES NOT do anymore.  Hubby thought he found something cheaper & switched items in my cart, so I got this crap version. Even the case & paper insert look like a bootleg copy. Don't buy this for a Twilight fan... They will be highly disappointed.  It wasn't any kind of deal. I have no idea why this was even made, unless it is an actual bootleg item.  Very disappointing that it even exists.  & Eclipse is my favorite book & movie.  I have been promised another copy.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|Most of the newer entry level Nikon DSLRs do not have commander mode to remotely control the flash OFF Camera. As the owner of both a D5000 and D3100 I wanted to be able to remote fire my SB-600. Now that I have the SB-700 I can do so very easily. The interface on the SB-700 is much more straight forward than the SB-600 which requires you to push two buttons at the same time to enter certain menus to control the flash. The SB-700 is easier and faster to setup and has more features than the SB-600.    The SB-700 also includes 3 flash covers: Diffuser, Tungsten and Florescent. These unlike gels that wear out come in handy in certain lighting conditions to get the shot you want without having to purchase aftermarket covers/diffusers/gels (nice touch Nikon!).    Though the SB-700 is slightly less powerful than the SB-600 I just find I rather shoot with the SB-700. The SB-700 also has the \\"Bounce Card\\" on top of the wide angle diffuser cover. I wish they put that on the SB-600 as it is very useful when you can't bounce light on a ceiling you can at least bounce the light off the card to light up the subjects eyes.    All in all I highly recommend this flash over the SB-600. I wanted to get the SB-900 but its just too big/heavy for \\"MY\\" needs and couldn't justify the additional cost.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|First, my rating is for this disc, not the movie. I give the movie 5 stars. I also give the disc 5 stars... IF you have a compatible bluray player. I got this for a christmas present from my mom. We tried to watch it while at her house and could not because of all the extra 2.0 menu crap. There was no way to skip it for us. Others said they could just hit cancel on the first message that said it couldn't connect tot he internet. They said they could wait a while and the movie would finally play... My mom has a brand new visio bluray player (with net apps if that tells you how new). it is a 2.0 player. It took about 5 minutes to get the first message about the internet... I canceled out of that, then waited... then waited... then waited some more. We walked down to the beach for a bit and came back... and it was still sitting on a black screen... it never played! For that, this ITEM gets 1 star.    I brought the movie home and it played without a problem on my panasonic. When you get the full effect, the skynet edition is pretty cool but honestly, who cares to see the stuff that makes it the skynet edition more than once?
0714843377|2.0|The title of this book had me very excited to read its content. I thought for sure I'd find some insightful commentary about building and exuding confidence in yourself and your work. Perhaps there would be some helpful tips on re-shaping your thinking and setting goals and ways to achieve aspirations you weren't entirely sure you could reach. Maybe there'd even be some creative tidbits to appeal to my designer self. I'm sad to say I found very few if any of these things in the book.    I've read some reviews of people complaining that the cover is mis-leading to those not within the advertising industry and I can certainly understand their point. Many of Arden's thoughts are framed from the perspective of an ad exec or creative director. This didn't deter me personally as I have a background in advertising though I've since moved into consulting and user experience design. What did bother me, however, was the old-school mentality of his advice. The advice perpetuates what many now consider to be harmful practices to the industry such as spec work and exaggerating in ways that seem smarmy-leading to consumers' mistrust in the ad industry. I even found some suggestions in this book to be downright offensive. For example, he suggests creating business cards for yourself which twist your title or company in very mis-leading ways. He suggests a \\"Pump Attendant\\" create cards for himself that tout \\"Petroleum Executive\\" and that a first-year student of architecture print cards which lead the recipient to believe they OWN an architectural firm. I suppose I can see his point if it's that we should not feel hindered by our current title but be willing to explain, with confidence, our true value or future value. But why can't you talk up your good qualities, willingness to learn, strong work ethic and do it all while being confident AND honest? I'd never want to work with someone that I felt intentionally deceived me about their position or status to get ahead.    And lastly,I don't feel the author went into enough depth on any of the topics in this book. His thoughts are sometimes disjointed and mostly superficial. I'd have rathered he choose one or two points in this book and give more in-depth analysis, personal anecdotes and solid advice based on his experiences. I did decide to give this book two stars because I found three or four morsels of valuable insight and there are some nice quotes in the back. I suppose if that's all you're looking for and you're willing to pay $10 for it, then this book isn't all that bad. But, for my expectations and for my money, it just wasn't enough.
B00328R21C|4.0|My grandson listed this among his Christmas \\"wants\\" for 2010.  It was very well received by him!!!  He enjoys assembling Legos.  I will get him more.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is outstanding.  The author does an outstanding job of portraying the story thru the eyes of a five year old boy.  The relationship between mother and son stole my heart.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I really like these headphones.  Sounds are crisp, clear, and I can make it as loud as I can tolerate.  I can easily tell \\"direction\\" based on how I hear the sounds, which I was worried about losing due to not using surround sound speakers.  In addition, I can hear higher frequencies than I have heard before (shell casings hitting the ground, footsteps, etc) and really think this helps me out.  The bass seems pretty good.  It's not the house-shaking bass that my subwoofer puts out during explosions, but then again, it's not shaking the house, which is the reason I got these.  In-game chat works great, and I can actually hear my friends talking to me now.  The headphones mix in your own voice into the headphones, so you don't have to shout to hear yourself talk.  All my friends hear me just fine through the included mic.   As others have said, when you turn on the mic function, you do get a slight hiss/hum in the background that is noticeable.  This is an area for improvement, and kept it from getting 5 stars.  It is enough to be annoying, but not ruin the experience.  It probably wouldn't be noticeable except that when the mic is not on, the sound is absolutely crystal clear, when it is on, hum/hiss.  The only other thing as other have mentioned is that there is no battery level indicator.  It would be nice if there was some sort of beep or noise to let you know that your batteries are getting low.  There is no warning, when they are too low, it just shuts off, leaving you with no sound.    Overall, these are very high quality and I really like them.  I am hearing sounds that I never heard before, and my wife is happy that she is not hearing sounds that used to shake the house and annoy her. I can hear and understand my buddies and they can hear and understand me.  If I want to watch TV or a movie in silence, I can.  Great purchase.    UPDATE AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF USE:    Updated 6/29/2011-  Lots of things you buy seem great on day 1, I am updating my review to let you know of a few downsides experienced so far-  Overall, I still love these, but there are a few annoyances that really should be worked out by Turtle Beach in subsequent models.     -1) You really need to add in some sort of audio or visual indicator that the batteries are getting low, perhaps a slight beeping in the ears or a light on the side of the headset, it never fails that the darn batteries decide to quit in the middle of an intense multi-player COD match.  No warning, no nada, just poof, no more sound.  Try playing a multi-player FPS with no sound after getting used to hearing footsteps all the time!      -2) The included chat cable to connect the headset to the controller is absolute garbage.  I was getting clicks and pops and noise the point that my friends asked me to just turn my mike off because it was bothering them.  I replaced the cable with a $3 cable available on Amazon which works flawlessly.  You are telling me that a $3 no-name cable works better than your expensive, included cable?    -3) More of a wish-list than anything else- Make the unit expandable to be able to use another wireless headset.  The current set up is great for me when playing games, but if the wife wants to watch a movie with me, and we want to wear headphones, I have to plug a wired unit into the base.  I would gladly pay for a spare set of wireless for guests if the base unit could beam the sound to all headsets.

0545140323|5.0|picked up Elizabeth Eulberg's THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB just when I needed it most. I was going through a difficult breakup and was pretty disillusioned, much like our main character Penny. She's pretty much given up on the opposite sex and is determined to start anew - without a boy to complicate things.<br /><br />Penny swears off boys, and highly encourages that her friends do so too, but this book isn't really about a woman, or girl, scorned. It's about being true to who you are, about doing things for you, and about realizing who your true friends are and being faithful to those relationships.<br /><br />It's easy to lose your identity when you're in a relationship, to blow off your friends because you'd rather spend all your time with him, to slowly make someone else's interests your own. THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB celebrates individuality, strong girls, and healthy relationships with a quirky main character leading the way. Penny doesn't sit around and mope after her heart is broken, she's proactive. She looks around her and she sees how destructive her peers are to themselves, all in the name of boys. Eventually, Penny comes to realize that it isn't necessarily boys that are the issue... and, even though, deep down, many girls are aware of the truths Penny and her friends learn, it's comforting to see the characters achieving this realization and making the same journey many of us will take ourselves.<br /><br />I enjoyed Penny's character, but was thankful for the secondary characters as well. I think most girls will identify with our main character, but, if not, they'll definitely find something in common with one of her friends. Not only does this  allow for a deeper connection between the characters and the reader, it allows Eulberg to demonstrate how the lessons The Lonely Hearts Club members learn apply to every girl.<br /><br />And we can't expect our heroine to swear off boys forever, can we? Her blossoming romance is adorable and I found myself rooting for the boy in question!<br /><br />I believe every mother, daughter, and sister should take the time to read this book. I haven't sworn off boys forever, but I'll be entering my next relationship with the lessons from THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB in the back of my mind.ve every mother, daughter, and sister should take the time to read this book. I haven't sworn off boys forever, but I'll be entering my next relationship with the lessons from THE LONELY HEARTS CLUB in the back of my mind.
0446569895|4.0|\\"I Am Ozzy\\" is an interesting and hilarious read. Ozzy gives us a lot of detail about his childhood, his days with Black Sabbath, solo career, and his personal life. How accurate are Ozzy's recollections of past events? Even Ozzy admits that his recollections may not be completely accurate. Regardless, the book is still worth reading because we get Ozzy's views on the set of events and controversies surrounding his life and career. The only thing this book lacked was greater detail about Ozzy's time, relationship, and music with his guitarists, especially, Randy Rhoads. All in all, a great book!
B00448VST6|1.0|Really enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone who is interested. But do not under any circumstances download this movie! Buy it in stores. That is the sole reason for the 1 star rating. The download comes with digital rights management (DRM). This makes it impossible to watch the movie on anything but the computer you download it on. You cannot burn it to a dvd, you cannot transfer it over to personal computers. I bought this download for a friend for Christmas since I couldnt find it in stores. Now I have to re-buy this movie because I can't copy it over to my friends computer or burn it for them.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I bought seasons 1+2 of Seinfeld but was sent Season 3 which is much better and more expensive. Thanks Amazon warehouse workers!
0439023513|2.0|OK, I rather liked the first two books. They were decent reads for a plane trip - an easy 2-3 hour filler that took up a bit of time. Good if your Battle Royale or Running Man DVD wasn't working. The language is simple, the story is nothing but romantic tension and copious violence, they're (mostly) attention-holding without too many cringe-worthy moments, and it's easy to thrash through them quickly. They're formulaic and derivative but there's nothing wrong with that in a trashy paperback.    This one? ATROCIOUS. It was like a bad action movie, as scripted by a 14yo boy. I wouldn't even rate it worth my time if I were trapped in an aluminium tube at 37,000'.    If you liked the first two books, steer clear of this one; invent your own ending because after building up for three books the ending is extraordinarily clumsy and unsatisfying: it's like Ms. Collins hit the minimum word count for her English assignment and just cut it off as lazily as she could.    Come to think of it, does she have kids? Maybe she got her son to write this.
B0010X758Q|5.0|The vinyl edition of Vampire Weekends debut self-titled album is a great record. This album is great and owning it on vinyl is even better. The sound is amazing and barely has that crackle that is on my older albums. The nicest thing is the consideration that went into the packaging. The album comes with a digital download that allows the listener the convenience of both digital and a traditional listening system. The best of both listening worlds.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|I purchased this video for my wife. She loves this movie.  It arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  She was delighted to receive this video as a gift for Christmas.  I highly recommend this movie. It is an action packed thriller involving a highly decorated combat veteran and the corruption that can and does occur in the federal government.
B00005UKE0|5.0|It's a well documented fact that during his time with the Beatles, George Harrison's attempted contributions were more frequently than not rejected by Lennon, McCartney and producer/sonic wizard George Martin. In the early days this proved to be a good decision but starting around the time of the release of \\"Rubber Soul\\" at least and especially on \\"Revolver\\" with gems like \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Love You To\\" he began to really blossom as a songwriter. And unlike John & Paul, he didn't have that valuable input from a collaborator to help him along. Speaking for myself, I find most songs by George from this point on to be at least equal to the songs by the Fabs' head writers. By the time the Beatles disbanded Mr. Harrison had amassed a good number of excellent solo compositions. Quite a few of these wound up on his debut solo album \\"All Things Must Pass\\". The song itself had been considered and rehearsed by the Beatles but was ultimately not used on any of the band's records until the Anthology series was released. It's on the third volume.<br /><br />While he probably didn't get the support he deserved with the Beatles, plenty of other great artists were more than willing to collaborate with George, not the least of which was his hero and friend Bob Dylan who co-wrote the seductive, sweeping opening number \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" and wrote the breezy country folk song \\"If Not For You\\" George and the band cover beautifully. Unlike the atypically sparse production he did for Lennon's \\"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\\" album, here Phil Spector unleashes his famous `wall of sound' to heavenly affect for a large part of the album. \\"My Sweet Lord\\" infamously got George in some legal trouble- a copyright infringement of the Chiffons' \\"He's So Fine\\", by all accounts an innocent accident. Nevertheless, it remains an uplifting and lovely piece if a bit repetitive. \\"Wah Wah\\" is a fine example of Spector's `wall of sound' approach with a great melody, rich guitar licks and a mighty horn section, the first real rocker on the album. \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" is a mournful ballad with wise lyrics that belie his relative youth. The slide guitar adds tasteful accents to this lovely song. \\"What Is Love\\" wouldn't have sounded out of place on any of the Fabs' mid to late LPs. Dylan's influence can be heard again in the tender ballad \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" that follows \\"What Is Love\\". Next is \\"Let It Down\\" which starts off in full symphonic rock mode before mellowing into its dreamy, languid verses then returning to a fuller sound again on the chorus. \\"Beware of Darkness\\" begins a bit melancholy but is ultimately uplifting, especially in the litany of warnings George sings about. \\"Apple Scruffs\\" is a carefree, light ode to the (mostly female) fans that hung around outside of Abby Road studios and the Apple building in the end days of Beatle mania. \\"Let It Roll\\" is a stately but gentle piece that evokes English gardens for me somehow. It precedes the uplifting gospel sound of \\"Awaiting On You All\\" adorned with lots of slide guitar and percussion. The title track closes the first disc- its melody is gorgeous, its lyrics simple yet so wise. I listened to this song a lot when several beloved souls passed away a few years ago and it helped me process my grief.<br /><br />Disc 2 of the CD version is weaker than the first. \\"I Dig Love\\" is somewhat weak, another version of \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" is bit redundant and the `apple jam' part of the album test my patience but \\"The Art Of Dying\\" is a strong rocker and \\"Hear Me Lord\\" is a very affecting spiritual ballad. On \\"All Things Must Pass\\" the jams sound professional enough but are in essence rambling exercises in playing. The jams were on the third vinyl LP and as a kid I listened to it a few times, never really impressed, and rarely do now. Regardless of this part of the album, \\"All Things Must Pass\\" stands as George Harrison's undisputed masterpiece and the strongest testament to his spirituality he'd ever record. This is a very fine album.

B0047WJ12K|4.0|Inception is a movie that actualy lives up to its hype. It has the stunning visuals of Avatar, but only with an engaging story. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because at certian times the multi layered story is hard to follow.
B002VECM6S|5.0|You don't have to be a fan of football, Sandra Bullock, or southern drawls, or the personality unique o the south to enjoy this movie.  Sandra Bullock deserved th Oscar and Tim McGraw was perfect as her partner.  The coaches, the school, the casting, the town ... it all worked for one of the best two hour treats of recent movie making.  Best line: who knew we'd have a black child before we knew a Democrat?  I loved this film and recommend it to everyone.  It is perfect entertainment.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This animated film is cute, funny, happy and sad all wrapped into one film. I also enjoy the film because it brings to light a couple of serious aspects of modern life. Definitely one of my favorite films.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|Am very much pleased with this product.  Learned a lot that I didn't know about the space programs and all its benefits.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is a bit confusing the first time you play it, but once you understand the game it is so much fun to play. Especially if you play with people you are equally matched to. For older kids (probably 12 plus) and adults. Only drawback is only 4 people can play unless you buy the expansion pack.
B002PQ7JQK|2.0|As a longtime Trekkie, I hate to write anything negative about it. However, my comments are directed only at the quality of the Blu-ray reproduction. Most of the bright, indoor scenes are crisp and clear as you would expect on Blu-ray. On the other hand, some of the darker special effects shots look like you're viewing them through a screen door. The lights and stars are not steady, but tend to flicker. This problem does not exist on every episode with every special effects shot, but it should not exist at all. I've noticed this on some other Blu-rays I've purchased in the past so it's not uncommon. Whatever the cause, I suspect it has something to do with the manufacturer going for quantity over quality. If you have a standard DVD set with the enhanced special effects, don't bother with Blu-ray. There's very little to be gained for the cost.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Maybe it's just the fact that I read this during the Christmas season with tons of distractions,but I didn't find the book to be as gripping as many of my friends that read it and recommended it so highly.  I found the \\"escape\\" just totally unbelievable, but there were other aspects of the book that I found quite real.  In short, good quick read; gives some interesting food for thought, but light in other places.
B002ZG997C|3.0|I just watched this movie....didn't bother going to the theatre...watched it at home<br />on DVD. Let me begin by talking about what I don't like about the movie. First,<br />at times I felt like I was watching some sets from the Mad Max and Planet of the Apes movies....How many motorcycles will be running in the future and how many gangs<br />will be out there? Water is a precious commodity, but gas is in abundance?<br />Seemed silly to me. I thought the acting of Gary Oldman and Denzel Washington<br />more then made up for those details. As a child of the 1970's...seeing Jennifer Beals again was Nice. The story is intriguing inspite of the Mad Max and Planet of the Apes \\"feel\\"....I thought Denzel's Eli was interesting, but at times I thought of the series Kung Fu.....again from the 1970's.....Fortunately those \\"reminders\\" don't deviate from a compelling story about a future I hope never happens....<br />The references to the Bible as both a reason for Hate and a reason for Hope is Interesting. The movie also has a fururistic Western feel to it which makes it appealing to non-sci fi fans.....<br /><br />Atreides
0439023521|5.0|I'm not a young adult, but I read this book on the recommendation of a couple of my friends.     It's an incredibly engaging book, in that I had to force myself to put it down to go do other things with my life. Luckily it doesn't take that long to read, so I only had to walk away from it a few times.    As others have said, it is a bit brutal. Not gory, but there are certainly parts that make you cringe.     I don't want to give away too much of the book, but I liked it enough that I wanted to put up a good review. Take a few days and read it! You won't be sorry.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|This DVD skips at various spots and will not play in others.  The disc is obviously very used due to this and the amount of scratches on the disc.  Definitely not as advertised.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|Ok, so this appeals to the younger set, but I have to admit, as a full-grown adult, I too got a kick out of all the drama happening. And it certainly doesn't hurt that all the main characters are easy on the eyes.  As far as the DVD set goes, the extras weren't very exciting and all the lovey-dovey from the cast was a wee bit over done, but enjoyable just the same.  So, anyone into the Vampire Diaries will certainly appreciate the whole set. Sometimes it's just easier to sit and watch 3 or 4 episodes (or one whole DVD) at a time because the story line flows quicker

B00004XMVI|5.0|U-571, 2000 film   The story begins in Spring 1942. German U-boats attack shipping in the North Atlantic, the supply line from America to England. The Allies can't break the enemy codes used to send messages. A U-boat launches two torpedoes to hit a ship. The appearance of a destroyer causes evasive action. The depth charges draw closer and create damage, the U-boat surfaces. An Enigma machine is used to report damage to Berlin. In the USA there is a celebration among sailors. Their passes are canceled, they return to base for a special operation. Their submarine is loaded with supplies and ships out. We hear the purpose of their mission: to intercept a damaged U-boat and capture the Enigma coding machine. [How did they know?] The German U-boat commander shoots a lifeboat with survivors. The S-33 approaches the U-boat. [Doesn't wearing an enemy uniform violate a Rule of War?]  The disguised sailors successfully board and invade the submarine, their tommy guns conquer the enemy. They capture the coding machine and its papers. The survivors are taken back to the S-33. Suddenly a torpedo hits the S-33 and causes an explosion! The boarders must use the captured U-boat and quickly learn how to run it. A few survivors are found. Somehow, a motor is started and the U-boat proceeds. A German airplane flies over, a destroyer is seen approaching. Can they escape? Destroying the radio shack prevents sending a warning. Can they use their last torpedo to sing the destroyer? The destroyer drops depth charges. The captain has a plan to save their lives by jettisoning garbage. Hersh explains their choices to the captain. More splashes are heard, then explosions coming nearer. The sub drops to 200 meters or 660 feet! Then another problem develops! They bring the U-boat up to the surface. A man must do a job in finding an air leak and turn it off. The destroyer approaches firing their cannon. The air leak is stopped in time. There is a spectacular explosion! The remaining crew abandons ship and paddles away.  This film is dedicated to the Allied sailors and officers who risked their lives capturing Enigma materials from U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic. This occurred in May 1941; October 1942; and June 1944, when U-505 was captured intact. This dramatic film is fictional. Hollywood does drama better than history. The Battle of the Atlantic was won through many means. Building Liberty ships rapidly provided expanded shipping. Small aircraft carriers provided a local air force. Producing more ultra-high frequency radar sets allowed detection of enemy aircraft and ships. Most of all, the convoy system provided collective security. The Allies knew about the Enigma system before WW II began; the machine was invented in the 1920s for businesses. They developed a mechanical device to help in decryption, it later developed into the electronic computer of the 1940s. &#34;The Ultra Secret&#34; explained this and was published in the 1970s. The Germans regularly changed their rotor settings but this had a flaw. Knowing the secret message alone won't do much good unless you can take advantage of it.  In 1944 many spies were dropped behind enemy lines &#34;to learn the secret of the Enigma&#34;. Most were quickly caught and tortured to learn their mission. They were pawns sacrificed to make the enemy believe the Allies could not read the Enigma traffic. Does this film echo that story?
B00275EHJG|1.0|I am shocked and disturbed by this film. It is completely inappropriate from start to finish especially since it is marketed to young children through commercials, toys, and even coloring books. The themes and characters are dark and deeply sad. I don't even have to get into how the scenes in the movie directly relate to the most horrible events in human history.  I feel this film does nothing more than to steal the innocence of children and put forth the idea that there is nowhere in their world that is ever safe.    This film is a Trojan horse promising to be fun and touching and instead it left me feeling betrayed and sick to my stomach. I wish I had never seen it at all, but since I have I feel compelled as a mother to warn other parents not to let their children see this film at all.  I could write a list a page long of how the various ideas portrayed attempt to teach terrible things about the adult world to children before they are ready.  I am appalled that anyone could feel good about showing this to any child.   How dare Disney Pixar teach children to be afraid of the beautiful process of growing up!! And what's worse, the so-called \\"feel good\\" ending of this movie does very little to fix the problem.  It really just reminds the viewer that this whole process of instability will go on and on. Hey maybe in Toy Story 4 the Toys can suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.  It's only fair seeing how I'm sure you've managed to give plenty of nightmares to the kids you serve.

B00337KM2S|2.0|You know those films that think they are so smart; the ones that brow beat you with their `message' but wind up blowing a lot of hot air for nothing, because they don't even know how to make their message come across as anything truly substantial?<br /><br />`Up in the Air' is one of those films.<br /><br />The basic premise behind `Up in the Air' is that of Ryan Bingham, a loner of sorts who ruins peoples lives for a living.  He is hired out by cowardly bosses to fire their employees.  He spends his life segregated from society and works his hardest to avoid any form of commitment, going as far to do motivational speaking where he instructs others on how to remove commitment from their lives (empty the backpack).  When Bingham's company sets in motion a change that will ground Bingham (who travels around the US to fire people) and forces him to fire individuals via internet conference, he starts to panic.  His self centered tendencies kick in, in the guise of mock concern for the people on the other end, and he finds himself traveling with a young business woman who is pimping the new system in order to `show her how it's done' so-to-speak.  Add to this an intoxicating woman named Alex who is just like Ryan, and you have a recipe for a mid-life crisis.<br /><br />Sadly, this films immature construction and poorly explored themes results in a mediocre attempt to capitalize on potential.<br /><br />I have a lot of minor issues here that culminate into one gigantic problem; the film is just too shallow, despite it's overabundance of overbearing `points'.<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman has a specific style to his direction that serves itself better suited for lighter fare and younger crowds.  His take on `Juno' in 2007 is an example of his talents better directed.  He created something fresh and sincere and in tone.  I even thought that his sarcastic touches on `Thank You For Smoking' were nicely placed and propelled the story (no matter how underdeveloped the film really was).  Sadly, his directorial approaches here are just out of place and distracting.  The film comes across like a poorly realized `television movie' thanks to the carefree effervescence he lends to each scene.  It is so airy and light and thus devoid of necessary weight.  The film seems to be trying to hard to be young, and it is not a `young' story.  The film also doesn't know how to make the most of the key scenes.  Take for instance Ryan's talk with his future brother-in-law.  It just seems so anticlimactic, especially for a scene that is designed to shed light on Ryan's personal shifts.  The script is just horrendously fleshed out.  The ending dives off the edge into an endless barrage of clich&eacute;s that try to (quickly) validate all the personality shifts in the central characters.  The endless finger pointing at Ryan's way of living was also a deterrent (not to mention that disgusting abuse of narration).  It was like Reitman thought his audience was too stupid to draw the right conclusion about Ryan's character and so he felt it necessary to remind us at every opportunity that his life was all about solidarity and that no one else around him (outside of Alex) understood him; thus he is abnormal.<br /><br />But of course he's not strange; he's just confused...right?<br /><br />The acting was a saving grace, although I'll never understand the praise and accolades heaped upon Anna Kendrick, who was fine but far from noteworthy.  George Clooney was charming and sincere and likable despite his unlikable tendencies.  In other words; he was very comfortable playing himself and it showed.  Whatever.  Vera Farmiga though, was a triumph and I'm so glad she was recognized by Oscar.  What she does with Alex is beyond words amazing.  She actually creates a character who is well rounded, understandable and three dimensional.  When her character is truly uncovered you sense all the layers of this woman stripping away and it is gloriously handled with a simple stare.  Farmiga is a master actress and I'm so glad that this film gave her the chance to make her name better known.<br /><br />In the end I'm struggling with this one.  I mean, the whole `we are poignant because our current economic state is a mess' angle just didn't do it for me.  The ending collection of `confessions of the unemployed' was embarrassingly unnecessary.  It just felt like a lazy `tag on'.  The film isn't that invested in the idea that our current state of affairs is that relevant to Ryan's story.  This is a story about a man-child who needs to grow up.  Just because he happens to fire people for a living doesn't make his situation any different than 90% of all the other man-children depicted in cinema today.<br /><br />Yes, we all need to realize that a job doesn't make us but it is the people who surround our lives that make us who we are.  I get that.  Watch `Days and Clouds' for a film that really understands the weight this economy has on a person.  For `Up in the Air', the economic crisis is just a gimmick to attract unwarranted attention.his film gave her the chance to make her name better known.    In the end I'm struggling with this one.

B00275EHJG|5.0|This was my 3 year old daughter's first movie at the theatre, so it's special to us. Great movie; expect a few sweet tears at the end. I picked it up here for $13 which was a good price for just being released. Just one DVD with a few special features on it. Excellent deal!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I'm not a history buff and have no interest in politics, but this movie about a man's struggle to confront and overcome his handicap was riveting. I was pulled into the story and enjoyed every moment. You don't need to know anything about history to appreciate the characters or the movie. As a special plus there is no sex and violence (it is rated R due to four-letter words).
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I ordered this item on November 26.  It is now December 28 and I still have not received it.  It was supposed to be a Christmas present.  Usually Amazon is pretty good at getting things out to me in a timely fashion but definitely not this time.  Since I don't have the item, I can't really review it.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|We bought this for my 6 year old who is very interested in space. He absolutely loves it. Despite a few negative reviews I read i purchased it anyways. It does make a  little noise which doesnt bother my son at all. He turns it on every night and falls asleep with it on. The only thing I didnt like was that the pictures made it seem like the toy was clipped on to an exisisting light fixture when it actually has to be screwed into the celing. It looks great and works well though.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Can I return this set of movies. I was needing the regular DVD and I must have selected the Blue ray. The plastic wrap has been removed but the DVDs have not been removed from the box.
B002ZG9846|4.0|THis is a great must see movie for all comic fans.  I cant get the digital copy to work however, as it continously asks me to enable cookies when I already do have them enabled.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|The best game to flick. This one is worth your time. Tongue in cheek, the movie has fun. Alfred Molina chews the scenery and steals each scene he's in. The adults will enjoy as much as the kids.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|While I've generally liked all of Shakira's 21st Century albums (aside from the original release version of Oral Fixation Volume 2), I just can't get enough of SALE EL SOL!  I can't say that I dislike anything on here.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:B00004RKI2 Donde Estan Los Ladrones]], SALE EL SOL covers lots of musical ground.  I can't say I'm much of a reggaeton fan, but I must admit two of my favorites are Gordita and Rabiosa.  Both are kind of obnoxious--but in a GOOD way!  If my vote counts for anything, I'd like to see Devocion released as a single--it's \\"classic\\" Shakira.  There's a LOT to like about this album!  Lyrics included in the booklet.<br /><br />As a note, be aware that the WAKA WAKA versions on this album are remixes and NOT the single/video versions which feature other female vocalists.  So, if you're expecting what you've heard on the radio, this isn't it.  Although living in the backwoods of the midwest, I hate to report that we don't get to hear Shakira on the radio at all--not even \\"Hips Don't Lie.\\"  So, I'm forced to get my Latin musical fixes off the TV music channels and internet radio feeds!<br /><br />I give FIVE STARS to SALE EL SOL.  I liked it from start to finish and can't even muster a petty gripe about it!  In my opinion, as a complete album, it's the best Shakira album of the century--so far!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I adored Community already, but this is a terrific DVD set -- lots of extras, commentary on each ep, easy to navigate menu.  I love how the packaging even ties in so closely to the themes of the show.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|There are several very good reviews of this product that I could never top. If you care are seriously considering this, you will enjoy it. If you are someone who thinks it is a wast of time, it is not for you. No one here wants to convince you that we are right and you are wrong.  I purchased it from Amazon new for $129.00 at that price point it was a no brainer. The current price of $219.00 is a price point I would not be able to justify. Unfortunately, it appears you will not be able to get these discs separately like you can the remastered Stereo versions. So you must buy the set all at once or not get it at all. I think that the packaging is much better than the Stereo packaging. It fits better with other cd's and it is easier to get an individual cd out. Yes, I still buy discs instead of digital downloads. I burn all of my music to a lossless format and yes it does sound better than MP3 versions of the song. I have a nice stereo and the difference is easy to hear. How long will it be before I can only get the music as a lossy download? I don't know but until then, I will continue to buy CD's and make my own digital copy.
0316098337|5.0|I'll keep it brief because I don't want to give anything away from this magnificent book!  It hits every emotion possible.  At times I was physically shaking because of the intensity but it was never short of amazing.  Knowing I had to get up early I started the book and planned on only reading a few pages.  I couldn't put it down.  I read the entire book before falling asleep.  The exhaustion today was totally worth it.  Read this book.  It will be one of the best books you ever read!

B002776NS2|5.0|Have had this album for several months now...and it's one of the most compelling  collections of song and rhythms I've owned. I've left it playing continuously in   my convertible...the sounds are Natural celebrations of the magnificent earth--soulful, inspiring, lyrical. I paid $3.98 for the download..it's purely a privilege to hear music that is so moving, that speaks to the Universal being. I don't know how anyone would even hesitate, at any price. To have the magnificence of Yeha-Noha or any of the songs in this collection is nothing short of a Gift of The Ancestors. Beautiful way to expose young people to the chants and traditional songs of Native Americans or any indigenous people. It fills my home with energy. Great way to begin each day, I promise you.

His brother Randy Jackson posted a series of messages about the album on his Twitter account stating that family members weren't allowed at his studio where the album was being completed According to Randy, when engineer Teddy Riley played him some of the tracks, \\"I immediately said it wasn't his voice\\". In a statement, Sony Music Group countered that it had \\"complete confidence in the results of our extensive research, as well as the accounts of those who were in the studio with Michael, that the vocals on the new album are his own.\\"[39] Producer Teddy Riley, Frank Dileo and Jackson's estate have since defended Sony's claims that the song is authentic. Teddy Riley who worked on the songs \\"Hollywood Tonight,\\" \\"Monster\\" and \\"Breaking News\\", told Reuters that he had to do \\"more processing to the voice, which is why people were asking about the authenticity of his voice.\\" Said Riley, \\"With the Melodyne we actually move the stuff up which is the reason why some of the vibrato sounds a little off or processed, over-processed. We truly apologize for that happening, but you are still hearing the true Michael Jackson.\\" Ahead of the album's release, a lawyer for Jackson's father Joe said Jackson \\"would never have wanted his unfinished material to be released.\\" Will.i.am, who collaborated with Jackson for the album prior to his death, also criticised the release, saying it was \\"disrespectful\\" to release the unfinished material because Jackson was not able to give it his blessing.

B0044FEZBM|5.0|// This title has been available in Europe since november 2010 //    It's bizarre that the Bolshoi Ballet of today is still so slightly represented on video. In the last five or six years the Moscow company has developed again into one of the most compelling and popular troupes around the world, with a stunning roster of dancers and a vibrantly interesting repertoire. Yet, we can still count the Bolshoi Ballet video releases on one hand and as seems to have become a habit it is left to French companies to make it all happen. This new, very welcome release of the old Soviet ballet \\"Flames of Paris\\", revived in 2008 by former Bolshoi Ballet director Alexei Ratmansky, is again produced by BelAir Classiques - the same inspired team that also gave us recordings of \\"The Pharaoh's Daughter\\", \\"Bolt\\" and \\"Queen of Spades\\".    The original \\"Flames of Paris\\" dates from 1932 with a choreography by Vasily Vainonen and music by Boris Asafiev. It quickly turned into one of the most popular 'dram-ballets' of the era, remaining a hit with Russian audiences until the 1960's. Allegedly, it was also a favorite of the otherwise not particularly ballet-minded Josef Stalin. \\"Flames of Paris\\" carried an obvious ideological message with its dramatic French Revolution setting, depicting the triumph of the heroic people over a depraved monarchy and aristocracy.    With that ideological message now obsolete and rightly comprehending the significant value of the balletic legacy of the Soviet era, Ratmansky rewrote with Alexander Belinsky the libretto for his 2008 revival, focusing no longer on the brave masses, but rather on the fate of four individuals, two pairs of lovers, caught up in the uncompromising and bloody chaos of the French Revolution. Also by reducing the original four acts into two and with a smooth, almost cinematographic manner of storytelling, he made the ballet more appealing to a present-day public. Since most of the original Vainonen choreography was lost, Ratmansky choreographed anew from scratch, incorporating the surviving bits of Vainonen, among others the famous \\"basque dance\\". Interestingly, the resulting stylistic diversity - from Vainonen's classical and character dancing to Ratmansky's neo-classical with a tinge of modern expressivity - gives the ballet extra punch. \\"Flames of Paris\\" readily exemplifies Ratmansky's gifts to tell a story in dance, while there are very little choreographers nowadays who are as musical as he is. His choreographic invention reflects to a large extent the variety of moods created by Asafiev's score. While mime dominated the original Flames, in Ratmansky's ballet it are dance and movement that pull the action forward. Characters are introduced and shaped by dance, events are energized by a skillful use of the ensemble. The production is efficient and attractive with evocative decors by Ilya Utkin and Evgeny Monakhov, inspired on contemporary (monochrome) engravings. The handsome and colorful costumes designed by Elena Markovskaya further provide an agreeable historical time frame.    The story is simple. In 1789, two peasants from southern France, Jeanne and Jérome, fleeing from a brutal marquis, are forced to join a group of revolutionaries marching onto to Paris, led by the soldier Philippe from Marseilles. Jérome was saved from imprisonment by the marquis' daughter Adeline (a character introduced by Ratmansky), who eventually also follows the revolutionaries in disguise. Once in Paris, though, the Revolution is taking full swing and with the new Republic, freedom is proclaimed. But not without a certain price: in a dramatic denouement Adeline's true social status is uncovered and she is brought to the guillotine (also introduced by Ratmansky) before the terrified eyes of her friends.    With its thundering cannon, fearless red-bonneted girls waving tricolor flags, crowds chanting revolutionary hymns like \\"La Marseillaise\\" and \\"Ca ira!\\", and even the infamous guillotine \\"Flames of Paris\\" may bean unusual ballet at first sight, but there is no doubt it is quintessentially Bolshoi. The spirit and scale of the old, almost mythical Bolshoi lives on in it, but it is a reborn, exciting and talented Bolshoi guided by an inspired hand that turns it into a performance which can be relished by audiences of today. The cast seen here is very much ideal. To have Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev in the leads is a continuous blessing - their pas de deux alone would already be worth the admission price. They are the company's most acclaimed young stars of the moment and this DVD shows us exactly why. Supporting roles including an excellent Denis Savin and ravishing principals Anna Antonicheva and Ruslan Skvortsov, are all outstanding and reflect the Bolshoi's current state of grace.    The present performance was filmed live at the Bolshoi Theatre in March 2010 and generally captures the production beautifully. The editing is very agreeable, with not too many unnecessary close-up shots. The picture quality suffers from some red saturation in certain scenes, although overall the Blu-ray version scores better in this respect. The sound is excellent. Included is an interesting bonus feature with interviews with Ratmansky, Osipova and Vasiliev, about the genesis, revival and performance of the ballet. Finally, this release campaigns Ivan Vasiliev as the Bolshoi's principal superstar, whose first DVD this is, yet he might have been graced with a less unflattering cover photo. Otherwise, a five-star release.
0316098337|4.0|I really loved this book.  When I began it took a minute to get it.  I was worried.  It seemed a little cheesy that everything in the room(rug, plant, bed) were almost characters but, then it all fell into place.  This book is sad and sweet and well worth reading.

B003YUC2FE|5.0|I am reviewing this on the movies and the box set itself. The movies are obviously great and look even better on blu-ray. All 3 of these will be timeless classics.<br /><br />I also enjoy the toy box that they come in. I always like neat packaging anyway and this was a smart way to handle 10 discs in one box.

0553582038|1.0|I refuse to believe that the same author who wrote the first three books of the series also wrote this horrible terrible \\"book\\". It is even more laughable that the george martin took five years, more time than the time taken to write *all* the other three preceding novels, to come up with this steaming pile of cr@p.    Now compound that with the fact that it has been another five years since AFFC came out and there is no sign of the fifth book. In 2004-05 george martin said that the next book was ready to be published. A man of his word truly.     As I said before, I refuse to believe that books 1-3 and book 4 are the work of the same author. I call shenanigans on this. If book 4 is written by george rr martin then he stole books 1-3 from some unnamed author. there I have said it.    Do not buy or read this book. Do not start the series if you haven't already. The first 3 books were great but the original author is missing and some untalented imposter has taken over the series.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|LOST is not about the end as much as it is about the journey.  Even so, the 6th season provides an excellent conclusion to the entire series.  It is unfortunate that the LOST series did not go as long as originally planned, because the last few seasons end up feeling rushed as a result, with more action and fewer opportunities for intellectual intricacies.  In spite of that fact, the creators of LOST bring this, one of the greatest stories of our time, to an emotional and epic close.  If you enjoyed the earlier seasons of LOST as I did, you may enjoy this season.  It has the same feel and goes back to many of the same points the series began with.  However, many posters felt dissatisfied with the final season.  I contend that this negative reaction is more a result of disappointment over the very ending of the series than the way in which it ended.  LOST has always been a series that inspired thought, inquisitiveness, and even self-reflection.  In Season 6, there is arguably more screen time spent on finalizing character development and simply wrapping up the series.  However, if you truly invested yourself in its philosophy from the very beginning, its finale won't disappoint.  In short, it's an artful end to one of the greatest stories ever made.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|GITS II far surpasses the first film and is also a great summary of the concepts covered in the Stand Alone Complex series.  It's fantastic not only for the spectacular visuals it commands, but also for its interpretative depth.  This is certainly a film you will want to enjoy again and again, uncovering a new layer of complex philosophy each time you do.  The scenes are as artistic as they are political.  This is THE film to watch in the 21st century.  As we continue to integrate technology more and more in our daily lives, it provides a necessary pause for thought.
B003TML0VO|3.0|I soley bought this product because it was on the 'lightening deals.'  I like some Santanas songs, and what I have heard of them, they are smooth, mellow, and easy-listening songs.  But most of the songs on this are way out there, and I don't get to hear the gift of Santana. Sadly- I will not listen to the CD as much as I had hoped.  Goes to show that should check out if I like the songs before I buy.  Lesson learned!
B002ZG980U|5.0|When \\"Inception\\" was in the theaters, I chose not to believe the hype and skipped it.  Then I watched it on DVD five months later: WOW!  Yes, it borrows some elements from other movies (especially \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Dark City\\"), but the concept is endlessly fascinating and the execution is absolutely perfect: not one dull moment, not one botched line of dialogue, not one clumsy edit!  Christopher Nolan is in the big leagues now (\\"Memento\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\" bored me to tears, but \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"Inception\\" are amazing).  James Cameron and Peter Jackson replaced two has-beens named Lucas and Spielberg; now they (Jackson maybe, Cameron definitely) are about to be replaced themselves.
0316096199|5.0|Alice Siebold's memoir of her rape at Syracuse University in 1981 is a cautionary tale of the unanticipated consequences of violent sexual assault.  In precise prose Siebold chronicles the subtle losses that accrue in the mind of a rape victim to a point where the victim actually experiences a loss of the Self so catastrophic that the conflicted emotional state can best be compared to that of war survivors.  Sadly, for soldiers as well as victims of rape, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that ensues is a war between the conflicting aspects of the  personality:  the innocent victim who never asked for her fate and the fearful, angry, disillusioned survivor who strives to deal with the consequent psychological disequilibrium.  This hyper vigilant state - the survivor's legacy - means that the victims of war and rape experience difficulty falling and remaining asleep, have an unusually intense reactivity to sudden, unexpected noise, and generally experience a pronounced alteration of their nervous systems as a result of the trauma.  Thus, one could argue that the survivor is hardly \\"lucky,\\" as Alice Siebold was told after her rape, having lost not only her innocence but her peace of mind as well as her very identity.  Siebold details a journey to recovery that is arduous, emotionally painful and never over.  One lives the aftermath of such violence forever, without respite.<br /><br />Siebold writes acclaimed dark literary fiction with unparalleled grace (\\"The Lovely Bones\\" and \\"The Almost Moon\\").  Perhaps the experiences detailed in this memoir provided the emotional depth for her to do so.  Whatever reason, she has an uncanny grasp of man's dark side, and it serves her well in her fiction.  Her memoir describes an emotionally isolated childhood in a home of intellectuals who maintained a calculated distance from their children and each other.  Her father, a Ph.D from Princeton and professor at Penn, was a workaholic who retreated to his study to translate Spanish classics and lived for his summer conferences sans family abroad.  Emotional expression was anathema to him, even when his frustrated daughter demanded he show some affection toward his wife upon departure for his annual escape to Spain.  Siebold's mother, educated in an elite school, was subject to \\"flaps\\" --  disorderly, painfully debilitating emotional meltdowns resulting from anxiety.  For years, she was an alcoholic until she managed to end her dependency.  Although the Siebold house was full of books and both daughters were well read and intelligent, family discussions were sadly lacking.  The daughters had difficulty speaking to their parents or each other and instead withdrew to their respective rooms for solace.  Both girls were virgins, subscribing to a code of personal ethics that precluded their giving away their chastity and thereby being held hostage to male demands or an adolescent desire for popularity.  That both girls were idealistic in that sense is particularly revealing; both were steeped in classical literature, their lives formed by the information and romance of books.  In fact, one of Alice's boyfriends was a Cervantes devote', seeing in her suffering after the rape his own version of Dulcinea while mimicking Quixote in the process of courting her.<br /><br />Particularly interesting is that after the rape, Siebold's father could no longer fail to recognize his obligation to his daughter; he had to accept the emotional responsibility of acknowledging her  plight as well as acknowledging the inhumanity of others.  He is compelled to assume the levity of parenthood.  Although he manages to avoid some of the responsibilities of the father of a rape victim during aspects of the trial, he cannot escape all of them.  In the end both parents are tainted by the crime; nevertheless, they are obligated to be there for her.  For them there is no alcohol, no study to disappear into, no coping mechanism nor mental illness that can cushion them from the reality of Alice's plight.  Distant though he is, her father ultimately grasps the Phyrric victory his daughter achieved in the trial process even if her hard won effort is incapable of being fully understood by one so imprisoned by his intellectuality and aloofness.<br /><br />One of the worst aspects of Siebold's victimhood was the sense that she, along with all others who'd been raped, was a freak and would always remain so.  People didn't know what to say to her.  They were insensitive to her needs and for the most part chose to withdraw from her rather than deal with her suffering.  This meant that she was the subject of scrutiny without the necessary emotional support.  To counteract this, she insisted on retrieving out of the ashes of her personal suffering the benchmark experiences of the modern coed: having boyfriends, experimenting with sex and drinking, and enjoying the social status of a student writer and intellectual.  As she stubbornly clung to the possibility of resuming a normal life, she didn't realize that she was escaping in the pat ways survivors do: through drugs, through alcohol, through playing victim in announcing her rape through her own poetry, and through informing her mentors and others of her plight.  She returned to Syracuse in the fall and sought out her old friends and reclaimed her literary opportunities in an attempt to achieve some kind of normality.<br /><br />Finally, she takes charge of her fate when she glimpses her assailant.  At this point, she experiences the full extent of survivor's rage.  She allows the rage to fuel her vengeance and gains some satisfaction from that endeavor.  Yet she cannot escape the sense of freakishness that is part of her acquired identity.  She has migraines.  Her sexual experiences are unsatisfactory and increase her sense of victimhood.  Her friends find her difficult since she is unable to refrain from discussing the rape.  At one point she composes a poem to achieve a catharsis and it has a disastrous result.  Her poet mentor refers to that tragedy as related to  \\"this poetry thing,\\" as if the poetic expression of one's trauma is merely a door that opens up all the unpleasant experiences of suffering humanity -- a vile Pandora's Box.  The \\"poetry thing\\" is the communication of sordid thoughts; poetry fuels the bleakest of truths.<br /><br />As the years progress Siebold realizes that her life has spun out of control.  She is taking heroin and remaining with a man she doesn't respect.  She becomes a teacher and as such is privy to stories of diverse women.  She studies up on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and reads materials she avoided when she pursued a normal life.  At last she seeks the truth, and she finds it in the stories of the ordinary women she teaches.  As their teacher she achieves a life purpose as well as the psychological strength she yearns for.  Earlier she had lamented, \\"I wanted to be better, but I didn't know how.\\"  She realizes she was depressed then, but now she can act because she has come to an understanding of something that once derailed her.  This speaks to the validity of truth.  As had her mentor, the aging military veteran at the writers' retreat she attended in California, she comes to an understanding of what a burden the whole experience of her rape actually was and how it stunted her emotionally.  She had earnestly tried to deal with it, but not knowing how and still trying to be authentic, she had slogged on, wallowing in her despair until she reconnected with her true self through teaching.  She then extends herself to her students.  The novels that were to follow this memoir testify to her having gained insight and depth through her horrific experience at Syracuse University and her teaching.<br /><br />The book is a straightforward, explicit account and a thoughtful, analytical road map through the shattering, labyrinthine nightmare of violence.  After reading this memoir one approaches the subject of rape with more insight and compassion.  For me, although a woman and always fearful of such an experience myself, it means that I now realize the vast possibilities of reaction to such an experience.  I would think most victims would heal by articulating their experience, as Siebold did.  For me, dealing with unpleasantness requires acknowledging the truth, and one must inevitably express that pain in a constructive manner such as telling someone close to you or dealing with it in terms of art.  I would press charges against my assailant, as she did.  For Alice, however, these measures did not complete the process of recovery; the act and the fear it engendered remained.<br /><br />Her friend chose another method of recovery; she elected to hold onto her life as it was before the rape.  Her choice was to deny the consequence of the rape and to erase from her presence those who reminded her of it.  Thus was she willing to abandon a friend for her own emotional survival, a choice Siebold probably would not have made.  For me this was one of the most interesting aspects of the book - how diverse are the ways people survive such trauma.  For Alice whose upbringing had been emotionally hollow due to parents who did not express their emotions or repressed them in the name of intellectuality and decorum, being an emotional person mattered.  For her, maintaining her friendships mattered and likewise holding on to her need for self-expression was as significant for her as her healing from the violence.  Thus, she chose dulling the pain through substances for a while, but the need for authenticity reared its head again and again until she chose the path of recovery in that sphere of her life as well.<br /><br />In this regard, the book is a fantastic, meandering journey, a model for how an emotional female proceeds from the damage of rape, the loss of innocence and her virginity, and the underlying disgust for her fellow man to become a realized human being who understands, not only the consequences of human violence, but also the importance of regaining authenticity in one's life, even if it is so hard, being as we are, surrounded by those whose values of truth and honesty are not the same.  For some, the truth of any matter is not as essential as is the survival of the psyche at any cost.  For them, as in Lila's case perhaps, it is the maintenance of the image that matters most, not the healing of the mortified soul.  Better to ignore that component and move on, as so many do in terms of relationships, conflict, jobs, homes, etc.  For Alice, being attuned to the world and capable of emotional commitment and expression truly mattered. Because of that, hats off to Alice Siebold for her courage and honesty in the face of push-back and indifference from those close to her.  Thumbs up to the woman for whom Truth mattered most!<br /><br />There are a few examples of awkward syntax in this book.  There are some baffling observations such as Siebold's of the poet Tess Gallagher:  \\"She had long brown hair held back by combs near her temples.  This hinted at an underlying humanity.\\"  Pardon me?  How so?  There are long stretches of trial testimony that are repetitive but arguably necessary.  The language of the book is direct without flourish or lyricism, just straight talk, as it probably should be.  There are few moments where the narrative bogs down, and in my judgment there is little, if any of the book, that is superfluous.  This is a powerful read, if one is willing to extend herself to understand --  without judgment and with a keen eye for truth in all manifestations.  Rape is a dark subject, after all, and not every reader wants to tread into those black waters.  But for those who do, \\"Lucky\\" provides the insight good literature promises without sensationalism or maudlin sentimentality.  Just the truth, folks.  Unvarnished, painful, uncomfortable, distasteful, unsettling, disgusting... are adjectives that come to mind regarding the subject, but not thewriting.  This is not a book for the timid or the superficial, but it is one for those who read to understand the world - both its grandeur and its darkness.<br /><br />Marjorie Meyerle<br />Colorado Writer<br />Author of \\"Bread of Shame\\"man and always fearful of such an experience myself, it means that I now realize the vast possibilities of reaction to such an experience.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|the book is a great story with a non stop mood of danger and action. when you read the book you will read until your finish it is a great book
0375851569|5.0|An easy, fun way to start reading English. Great for non-English speakers. The collection is very good value per money, buying the single books separately would have been almost double the price (per item).
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This was my first Blu-ray movie purchase and I think I couldn´t choose another movie to start our Blu-ray collection. The combo is filled with lots of goodies and the DVD disc is a great plus if you want to see it on yoru laptop or PC
B0018P4L8I|1.0|bought it a while ago. I did not notice the warning about no English subtitles (was it even mentioned back then?!) and I was greatly disspointed. its a WONDERFULL, AMAZING movie, but completely missed w/o translation. what a miss!
B001AQO3XS|4.0|I love this movie, I originally watched this for the first time in the theater when I was a teenager and loved it.  I bought the VHS, then the DVD, and now this BD.  Taking into account how dated this is, and some of the bad editing, this movie still is entertaining and I love the characters.  The one issue that I've always disliked was the tinny and grating soundtrack.  I don't know what they used to record it but it sounded to me like it was done on the cheapest equipment you could find at the time, that's why I took away one star.
B000VMFDW2|3.0|Firstly, i must make clear my undying support and utter respect for all of the Allied soldiers, underground combatants, displaced persons, populations affected (all over the world) by the war effort, as well as the nearly hundred million fatalities caused by WWII.<br /><br />Please bear this in mind while i criticize a book, not the man, his efforts, unit, the Marines, the US or the Allies.<br /><br />This book has only reached bestseller status because of the HBO series \\"The Pacific\\" (\\"Band of Brothers\\" in Asia).<br /><br />Eugene \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge, a bonafide war hero who fought on the front lines in some of History's bloodiest battles, is nothing if not honest when he says that he wrote this book as a family account of his experiences in WWII.  The book has little literary merit: it lacks style, the narrative is at times confused and, more often than not, repetitive.<br /><br />The author conveys his feelings regarding war in general and the specific battles in which he bravely participated in.  The book is a confused and confusing narrative of the conflict in the Pacific (which reflects, as the author wanted, the state of things on the front lines), seen from his very specific point of view.  It could have been a fantastic essay or short 50 page account with no loss of ambience or information.<br /><br />It is nevertheless important in that it shows the meat grinder's putrid innards with gory detail.  This book is a must read for students at military academies: officers will get precious insight into day to day frontline conditions and the psyche of the common soldier.<br /><br />Once again, I profess my deepest respect and gratitude for the selfless efforts of men like Private Sledgehammer.
0810979772|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this book. Very cute. If you have a Diary of a Wimpy Kid fan...this is a must have!
B002ZG99CC|4.0|This was so much better than the original.  I liked Jaden Smith in this, less cheesy than Ralph Machio(where is he now?)  The producers kept the same theme and feel of the original, but made it for today's youth.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Loved the Pacific a great follow up to the Band of Brothers. Both are the best series I've ever seen and are the favorites in my collection. The European theater always seemed to get most of the spotlight but this series \\"The Pacific\\" really sheds light on how tough the Pacific theatre really was and reflects on actual characters that really gave their all for their country. Its led me to read and research more about the battles and about the people these characters portray. This generation saved the World and I hope HBO will continue to tell the story to the younger generations and show the courage and sacrifice of so many brave and proud Americans. Thanks HBO
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|This anime movie is good! Unfortunately, almost all other Japan's anime movie without subtitle, sometime not in English or even in other language what I not know...
B0000C5RQF|5.0|This production of The Magic Flute is marvelous. Sir Colin Davis perfectly conducts this darkly whimsical production at the Royal Opera. The cast is very impressive. Diana Damrau as The Queen of the Night is very memorable. She has a strong vocal quality that is needed for the role. The top notes never cease to impress. The costumes and sets seem to exist in a fantasy world that is both dark and beautiful. A very imaginative take on the Mozart Classic! Highly Recommended!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|There's not much to say that hasn't already been said, so I won't waste your time. Community is funny, but intelligent at the same time. What I love most about it, besides it's meta humor and parody episodes, is it's heart. There's just something warm about this show that's missing in a lot of other shows on television today. It's sorta like how the Simpsons used to be, but instead of using Springfield, they use Community College as jump off point to dive into some completely zaney yet brilliantly contrived plot.    Community also makes good use of the ensemble cast, similar to Friends in that it starts out focusing on one character (or in the case of friends, Ross&Rachel)but as it progresses, grows to encompass the whole group, each with their own storylines often happening at the same time. Conspiracy Theories/Blanket Forts, Mean Girls/Tranquility Trampoline, to name a few in recent episodes from season 2.     It points out a lot of truths in life in smart ways, (the bar episode, also season 2), and their special episodes (xmas/halloween) were both phenomenal. (Though if i had to pick last season would have to win hands down)    There's just so much to say about how awesome this show is, and i could go on and on, but plenty of people have already done it. So what are you waiting for? buy it.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Great flick if you like to be scared. You won't sleep well afterward. Filming is kind of jarring and hard to watch (similar to Blair Witch). The camera jumping around so much is irritating. But overall, worthwhile.
0385335482|2.0|Asinine, Brainless, Clich&eacute;d.  It's not that I'm surprised; the title is enough to send my cortex into a debilitating palsy.  But honestly, even as far as chick lit goes, this book makes an instruction manual for how to buckle a seat belt look like a dissertation on quantum physics.  I mean, it is one thing to write a light romantic comedy with delicious, albeit predictable plot twists and happy endings.  But it is quite another to intoxicate oneself on nail polish remover and discharge a brochure on the modern day, fiscally retarded frivolous female using the writing sophistication of a remedial third grader, which is exactly what Kinsella has done here.  If you want to know the gist of this story it is as follows: Single girl likes shopping.  Single girl maxes out credit cards.  Single girl accidentally uncovers scandal at local bank that honestly, a mountain goat would have found suspect but for some reason the whole of London's financial sector is apparently bowled over by the revelation.  Single girl becomes famous, lands super high paying job, is no longer in debt, and randomly starts dating the wealthiest man in England so she's no longer single.<br />I know.  Let that sink in a second.  Now electrocute yourself because if you're anything like me your brain is flat lining, and move on with your day and far, far away from this book.
B003TML0VO|3.0|This is an OK CD but I wouldn't say that these are the greatest guitar classics and definitely not of \\"All Time\\". I am happy that I got this at a good deal.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sometimes you walk away from finishing a book and the story lingers with you--that's what Sarah's Key did for me. In this beautiful, easy to follow narration, the author flips back and forth between the 1940's Val d'Hiv roundup and modern day Paris. From the beginning, I was riveted to the story and couldn't put it down until I was done. I stayed up late at night and even snuck my Kindle to work so I could keep reading! Even after finishing the book I found my thoughts trailing back to this tale. This book was so great that I gave it as Christmas presents to some of my family members. Highly recommend.     If you like World War II/Holocaust stories, I would also recommend reading the Diary of Anne Frank, The Zookeeper's Wife and The Book Thief.
B001BZRUR4|3.0|I bought this book for my Kindle because I absolutely LOVED Markus Zuzak's \\"The Book Thief.\\" I found this book to be similar in writing style (very familiar narration) yet completely different at the same time. The storyline is interesting (not really believable but still interesting) the message is wholesome and the narration is easy to follow.    The only reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 4 stars is that the ending is completely off-in-left-field and is totally unrealistic. I loved the first 90% of the book and would still recommend it to readers. Just go into reading this book expecting the unexpected and be ok with things that are a little wierd and you'll be glad you read it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|At first I found this book a little confusing--the first chapter throws you right into the story and each chapter jumps to different moments in time with different characters. It aggravated me a little but I kept reading, and I sure am glad that I did! As the book continues, parallel stories bloom and follow a whole family during different times of their lives. About 1/3 of the way into the book, I was completely engrossed, and stayed up late to try and read more. This book was VERY well thought out and the timeline-jumping of each chapter ended up making complete sense as the tale progressed.     As I was reading, to make things simpler, I drew a family tree of the characters and added branches as new children, parents, aunts, cousins etc were introduced into the storyline. I also put a few notes like (very kind, had many miscarriages, died young) to keep up with the family tree. This made it much easier to keep track of the entire family and the story as well.    If you like this book, I would recommend reading anything by Edward Rutherford, especially \\"London\\" or \\"Sarum.\\"
B0029QRA1U|1.0|The unit has poor record to digital   The software has no filtering for needle clicking  The cartridge is low quality     I cannot recommend this product!!!!!
B0041VB8BO|5.0|These guys are absolutely wonderful! This is one of the rare albums that does not have a weak song in the bunch. It is a necessity especially if you liked The Format's Dog Problems.
0316069485|4.0|The book's title has a double meaning:  the \\"Lincoln Lawyer,\\" Mickey Haller, normally a defense attorney, is asked in this instance to act as an independent prosecutor in a 1986 case that the higher court has reversed and sent back for retrial.  The defendant was convicted of abducting and murdering a 12-year-old girl and has served the past 24 years in San Quentin.<br /><br />As a condition of accepting the appointment, he demands his ex-wife Maggie McPherson as his second chair and his half-brother, LAPD detective Harry Bosch, as his investigator.  Rounding out this little family get-together are Mickey's and Harry's daughters, cousins who have never me but finally get together along the way and showing some human sidelights of the two main characters, especially taking the hard edge off Harry as an inexperienced parent.<br /><br />Bringing together the protagonists of his two popular series gives the author the means to write a straightforward courtroom drama led by Haller, as well as a fairly good police investigation a la Harry Bosch.  The plot moves forward in alternating chapters, with each concentrating on one of them, giving the reader an insight into not only what goes on in the courtroom, but also outside those hallowed walls.  Written smoothly, with a somewhat unexpected conclusion, \\"The Reversal\\" is recommended.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a fantastic game!! My 12 year old son got it for Christmas, he has played it before at a friend's house, and HAD to have his own! I played it with him, and had the BEST time! It's easy to learn, and addictive! We love that the pieces of the 'board' are mixed up every time you play, so you never play the same game twice,, that will add YEARS to our game playing fun!      One flaw we do see, however, is that the pieces that form the outside of the 'board', bow up a little, making it hard to get all the middle hexagon pieces to sit just right,, But my son figured out that if you put heavy objects on the border pieces while you are putting the middle pieces in, everything goes a lot smoother, and the game stays together throughout play, even when the heavy things were taken off. We think they could have made the 'board' pieces out of wood or plastic, because eventually, cardboard wears out.  That being said, everthing IS made durable,, even the cardboard pieces are heavy duty,, just not entirely flat. I don't think it's a deal-breaker, I still would buy this game had I known that prior to purchasing it.  We will be playing this game for many, many years!

B003VIW8DU|5.0|Bought the CD / DVD package.  Excellent compositions.  Brian really reaches back into his early 1970s and 1980s.  Like most of his work these songs are highly orchestrated, timeless and  challenge the excellence  of both Roxy Music along with the Brian's other solo works.  Amazing!  The DVD is a must!
0375703861|3.0|There is a point in this novel where one fears, through the eyes of 2010, that it is heading into the most horribly cliched place; what, with its trending towards a public display with radical Islamic factions and all.<br /><br />But no, though there is a point where it becomes almost unbearable, *tedious*, to read--it comes back from that brink. Upon closer inspection, the publishing date was 2000, so it really couldn't have gone that far at all.<br /><br />Then again, this book is much more about what doesn't happen than what does. The end of the world that doesn't come, successes not fulfilled, intentions of the parents rallied and railed against to the maximum dissatisfaction, parentage unrevealed, destinies unfulfilled, affairs undone. People not killed.<br /><br />I was prepared to judge this book harshly; it spends much time dawdling and dallying with ideologies of characters without really saying much about them. Alas, it's the inaction, the non-thought that makes the characters. Frequently, this book is funny--but in a sly, sideways, wink-wink-nudge-nudge sort of way. It is unexpected, and one grows unexpectedly fond of the characters. Each and every one of them. In fact, there is not an unlikable one in the bunch (which does not denote that they are one-dimensional in the least). They are flawed, bored, underachieving--but they are endearing and well drawn.<br /><br />And as for the ending...well, I'm not spoiling anything by saying there isn't one. (It may frustrate some, and the author tongue-a-little-too-in-cheek acknowledges that one would like to see a result from the characters' pacing around the chessboard.) But there is no ending in life--only incidents. Only living with ourselves, our families, our nationalities, our faith--and this book manages to capture that quite beautifully.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I absolutely love these headphones & my kinship in LOTRO can here me very well too. I love them & would recommend them to anyone!
0345495004|3.0|I found this book simultaneously fascinating and overly sentimental; painting deep pictures of characters without revealing depth of feeling.<br /><br />It speculates at emotion and motive, but it feels like it never does more than scratch the surface. However, because it is based on fact (the thoughts and feelings of the characters are partially speculative, and partially based on fragments of old letters and accounts) it has a natural draw to it, and one cannot help but fill in some of the blanks with historical information.<br /><br />I went into this book NOT knowing--through some miracle of chance and gap in my education--how it would end. This made the story seem incredibly abrupt to me--but hey, it's an abrupt thing that happened. However, the characterization--where the author has the most leeway--feels extraordinarily drawn-out and slowly paced in comparison to the facts that had to go into the story.<br /><br />I'm also torn on decrying the book as following a cliched line. After all, it is *what happened* for the most part, so if it is cliche, it is only cliche in fact. This is most evident in the perceptions of the lovers of one another; slow-growing friendship turned to passion and a love seen through the eyes of perfect love, glorious, stimulating lovers...and then the shattering of illusions comes. Predictably, awfully... accurately? Perhaps it just could have been handled better.
0689877692|5.0|This book is wonderful - I am not sure what the kids that I bought it for will think, however, I felt like a child again exploring each pop-up page and marveling at the construction. It's a book that small children will need an adult to help with, but it still seemed sturdy and would stand up to many, many reads.  I will definitely look for more of these as gifts for kids - and adults!
0142000655|5.0|Oh Steinbeck. You and your accessible classics laden with allegory!<br /><br />This novel is an American classic in every sense that it can be: It's a going-out-west story. A family story. A foraging off the land story. A story of fortune. Of dreams and thwarted dreams. Of what makes a man (or woman) who they are.<br /><br />Steinbeck \\"himself\\" narrates the story--though from a still-omnipotent perspective--giving a unique tie into the story and also increasing the feeling that (though we know their innermost thoughts and motivations) we are merely observing the characters. We are all players in the Great American Drama of our lives.<br /><br />Steinbeck smacks the reader a little hard with the allegory stick--it's heavy handed and its explanations feel inorganic compared to the rest of the story--but the characters are so finely drawn that we forgive him. The players are in themselves flawed and good (or flawed and flawed), with depth--tragedy and fortune carefully portioned.<br /><br />Through the novel, we get the sense that our lives will repeat on a loop; the scenery will change. The players will change. The times will change. But there will always be the same kind of people in the world playing out the same acts of their lives. Perhaps this makes the Cain and Abel biblical allusions (heavy handed!) not so far-fetched after all.
B0001Z363W|4.0|This album is fantastic. It's mainly acoustic based but somehow still sounds really metal. Crazy or High has a really cool southern rock feel to it, and Steppin' Stone is just incredible. It kind of falters at the end as the cover of A Whiter Shade of Pale is kind of lame. I personally feel the best song is \\"Damage is Done\\" but that's just a personal thing I'm not declaring it the best song on here or anything. I think this is a really good album and one any Black Label fan needs to get. And it is a Black Label album, it's not anything like Book of Shadows. This album is much darker in lyrical content and overall musical composition. That album was more soft almost Neil Young-ish, this is a metal band.
030745455X|3.0|The second book in The Millennium Trilogy (or *is* it a trilogy...hmm... unfinished works are allegedly being discovered. . . ) is an improvement on the first.<br /><br />Unlike \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\", \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" leaves one feeling like they *have* read something fresh--or at least a less familiar case from a fresher angle. It doesn't suffer from being a textbook serial killer case or from *way* too much journalistic-industry-happenings.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, however, \\"Fire\\" is compulsively readable. It drags a bit in the middle, but it also has a bit more substance and bite than its previous iteration.<br /><br />Larsson does tend to get bogged down in the detail, however. Because this is an of-the-moment novel and it focuses heavily on technology, parts of it already feel very dated (and will only continue to be more so as time goes by). This isn't an issue in archaic-technology novels that aren't tech-focused, but it does seem to be a hindrance here.<br /><br />Like a typical middle novel, \\"Fire\\" suffers from loose end syndrome. It wouldn't bother me as much if its predecessor hadn't been so neatly wrapped at the end. This just feels like the novel got too long, so they put half of it in the next book (presumably). While a bit of the plot is wrapped up, we're still unaware of the denouement. It's incongruous with the previous work.

1593080220|5.0|This is simply one of the most gorgeous novels to come out of the Victorian Era. Though it is not unflawed--and at times, indeed, seems very archaic and even downright offensive--it is a beautiful book.<br /><br />Forster has a creeping wit that sneaks up on the reader, offering subversive little nips at the heels of the social constructs. Obviously, times were different when this novel was written, and some of the gender constructs seem downright simplistic or completely off--but one can almost not tell whether Forster is mocking this very construct, or if he is merely keeping pace with the views of his contemporaries. From that perspective, parts of this novel can be hard to read through the modern eye. (Of course, she gave up her opinions because, being a woman, she doubted that she could possibly be right. . . )<br /><br />However, the overall tone of the book is enchanting; there is a deep satisfaction with finding Home in a house, with little rebellions against complexity (even as the heroines are naturally endowed with the complexities that wealth gives) and a drive toward the simpler life.<br /><br />Filled with plenty of commentary on class and wealth and social responsibility--enough to keep a liberally-minded person sated in spades--the novel also focuses on human connection with fellow man, art, logic, etc. . . Indeed, its most famous line--the one that is so oft quoted--is \\"only connect\\". That pervasive sentiment gives the novel most of its gutting beauty--because how can you not take pleasure in connecting with something that is only begging you to do so? :)
B0033G9NVU|5.0|Bought this LP originally on CD. Had to listen to it 4 or 5 times.  I do really liking it. I rate it as one of there best; great on vinyl.  Love the song \\" Angel\\" the best; but the whole LP is excellent. Highly recommend it.

B00472OBYI|5.0|If you need a book that explains the socialmedia scene, full of interesing case history, this the right choice. Obviously in our fast world, it`s impossible to be always pefectly updated. But this is a good example
B003L77TZI|5.0|This is a great CD.  I love every song.  Last Friday Night is one of my faves, but all the songs are awesome.  Great second CD Katy!!!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Beautiful. The remastering is honest to the way the old recordings sounded. I know from experience that CDs can be mastered to sound fantastic and these discs sound fantastic.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|We need more artists like Janelle. She can ACTUALLY sing, she is completely out the box, the music is different yet entertaining, and she's not another musical clone. All I've been hearing on the radio is the same songs sung by different artists. Nobody is original anymore. Janelle's music is very different and may not appeal to the ones looking for another Beyonce or looking for another form of any female artist out there in fact.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Simple Review: I'm not going to bother commenting on how spectacular this series is, but it's amazing. I'm more writing to comment on the exceptional quality of the blu-ray edition of 'Band of Brothers'. For anyone wondering if it's worth purchasing on blu-ray, the answer is a definitive \\"YES!!\\". The transfer is astounding; they've given the 5 star treatment to this beloved series. I noticed that some reviews are saying that this isn't true, that the colors bleed or the blacks don't hold up. All I have to say is that you either have a cheap television, your blu-ray disc, or player, is defective for some reason, or you have no idea how to properly calibrate your HDTV (this is probably the case). I own a 58\\" Panasonic Viera Plasma HD TV (properly calibrated) and the transfer is absolutely amazing. If you own a great quality HD TV (preferably an amazing new Plasma rather than a LCD), that's properly calibrated, then you should love watching this series on blu-ray. LCD HD TVs will give you crappy motion-blur and doesn't show you films in the form they were originally meant to be seen in. So for the few people that are saying these are poor quality discs, you have no idea what you're talking about. This is a must have for blu-ray owners. And if you're going to drop money on an HD TV, then take time to do your research and find the ones that have the best picture quality, that show films the way they were meant to be seen, then learn how to properly calibrate your t.v. or find someone else that knows how to do it for you. Only then will you be able to truly enjoy the added benefits to owning films and television series on blu-ray.... especially ones such as 'Band of Brothers'. This is one of the best looking blu-ray sets I've seen thus far.
0061914177|5.0|This book isn't written as a long monologue of self-help advice.  Its a succinct collaboration of proven idea-bytes that will help you conceptualize the little nuances in your attitude and work ethic that will help you succeed at whatever your goal may be.  Its such a cheap buy, too, that its a good ROI if you learn even one thing from it.  I learned many things from it, so I give it 5 stars.
031603438X|5.0|I have always been a dedicated Stones fan, although born in 1974 I was on the back end of the train. I could hardly put this book down. Keith has brilliant insight about what it means to be a friend, and a musician. He writes very honestly and with much humor. I loved his bangers n mash recipe which calls for a cold pan to warm the bangers. I didn't know that, duly noted. What a life he has had and he feels like a genuine human being. Thanks Keith for letting it all hang out.  I have recommended this book to all my friends and even furnished my father his own copy to read on the beach in St Barth's.
B003L20ICE|1.0|This appears to be another movie people over rate the movie because of the subject matter. Good actors but I was very disappointed in the movie. It reminds me of the movie Piano, everyone raved about it so I watched it. That was 2 hours of my life I will never get back!
B00004R99J|5.0|I looked every where for this movie. Noone had it, & if they did the price was too high. I found  it here for a great price, in excellent condition & it was delivered to me in 3-5 days. How much better can you ask for.
B0040UAYI4|1.0|The device is a very good concept, but simply did not work.    I TRIED EVERYTHING. Went to the forum and asked for advice. I still had no luck.    It wouldn't recognize my mouse or keyboard (tried several), so I returned it.    I really wish it worked because I am a PC gamer and would haved liked to use my mouse and keyboard on my PS3.
B001EO748M|4.0|I bought the first season to 'try out' the series as I don't have cable/satallite and liked it well enough to go for season two--well season two made me a fan and I have ordered the rest of the series.  I have read several history books about the War of the Roses and the Tudors, so thought this series would be fun.  It was!  The second season, as other reviewers noted, was more true to history and focused on the creation of the Church of England (vs. Catholic Church).  However, the Anne and Henry story was just as interesting and Natalie Dormer (playing Anne) captured Anne as a strong, passionate woman, not a helpless pawn of her father or evil 'witch' of a woman--the best representation of the person I have yet experienced.      The second season picks up with Henry and Anne publicly together, shows Catherine in isolation and gives a very telling, but brief, view of Princess Mary after being declared a \\"bastard\\".  The best scene with Mary is when she is watching from a balcony her father Henry leave after visiting his other daughter Princess Elizabeth (he didn't stop to see Mary)--very poignent.  There is also a very powerful scene between Anne and Mary.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This is great, definitely a must have for you die hard COD players! The sounds are so defined and it feels as if you are right there in the game.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I really enjoy this movie with my dad. it was a great price. Thank You . I recomand it you get it.
1608870081|5.0|If you like pretty picture books, this is for you.  I bought it as a gift for my son who has read all the books.  He was excited to open it and immediately leafed through the pages.  I'm sure he'll sometime sit down and look through the details.  It's a great \\"coffee table\\" conversation piece for anyone who loves the books -- or even people like me who just love pop-up books and the effort it takes to make them.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|When i first got this book i was addicted. the first words will just make you want to read it andnot want to stop. this book had so much emotion and made me cry. i do not usually read books like this but it is at the top of my reccomendation list. hannah baker and clay jensen are amazing. by far one of the best novels i have read. i give it five stars.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I love this show!! I can't believe its $14.99 for the Third Season!! Which is an awesome season!! I can't wait for Season 4 to completely air on TV!! Another show you guys should check out is Psych on USA Wednesdays @ 7p or 10p!
B0040JHXTI|4.0|I thought Springsteen's The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story well worth the money.  The 2 concert DVD's were excellent.  I didn't check out the dvd on making the cd/dvd set, but I was more interested in his concerts.  I did like the 2 cd's - the Promise - but I'm glad that the songs that weren't on Darkness on the Edge of Town album were not used on it. The songs were good and reflect his music at that time in his life, but they were not the stuff that made Darkness on the Edge of Town the record it was.  Darkness was an album which reflected the raw anger,pain and hurt that life can bring you. Darkness came out at a time in my life when I was going through a real hard time and hearing Bruce sing about pain and anger helped me make a decision to change what was hurting me in my life. I also felt that I wasn't the only person who had this kind of anger and pain. Darkness will always be my favorite Springsteen recording.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|much much love for HIMYM.  Season 2 was a completely great follow-up to Season 1 as you get to know the characters more.  Yes Ted is sometimes a complete socially awkward moron, Marshmallow/Lilypad are disgustingly adorablely lovey-dovey, Barney is a patronizing womanizer and Robin is Canadian, but each character gets more dimensions added in Season 2.    It's absolutely hilarious and I've pretty much kept Season 2 on constant replay since getting it and I'm still not sick of it.  What's that? Self five? Nice! We out!
B003TXS5AC|5.0|On vinyl this thing is classic, it's a Maiden recording and its awesome. A great album, very different from other Maiden albums, I had to listen to it a few time to start enjoying it. On vinyl it comes on 2 records and all sides of the vinyl are picture discs so its great art work too.... It's not like Powerslave or Piece Of Mind or any thing, nice songs, some folks will definitely have to list to it a few times.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I recently received this album as a Christmas present from some friends.  I am the only person I know that enjoys Bob Dylan. Recently, these friends heard an NPR story on the most annoying Christmas songs, and at the top of the list was Bob Dylan's \\"Hark, the Herald Angels Sing\\", [...] they Had to get it.    This being said, I think this album sounds like Columbia Records lured an old, homeless bum into the studio to sing into their tin can, all on promises of a bottle of Ripple...    ... this is a new Christmas tradition..
0385737424|5.0|It took me a while to write this review. Not because I didn't like it, far from that. It just took me a bit to fully take the book in and fully appreciate all it has to offer.     Set in both the past and present, When You Reach Me follows the story of Miranda, a sixth grader, in 1979. It opens with her assisting her mother, who is preparing for an appearance on The $20,000 Pyramid. She diligently tests her mom, hoping they'll win the grand prize. While doing this, Miranda is haunted by the fact that notes she keeps receiving have, somehow, predicted the future - most notably, that her mother would be on the TV show. As she tries to figure them out, and who they're from, she reflects back to the first note's appearance.     It was earlier that year. Miranda had been disheartened by the fact that her best friend, Sal, decided to stop talking to her after she witnessed him get punched by an older kid. Because she no longer has him to walk with her to and from school, she has to pass the older boys who sometime taunt her and the crazy homeless man on the corner, nicknamed the Laughing Man, on her own. The Laughing Man continuously repeats to himself \\"bookbag pocketshoe\\" and Miranda, a truth New Yorker, has learned to ignore him and his puzzling antics.     With Sal no longer in the picture, Miranda makes new friends, including Marcus, the boy who punched Sal. Marcus, like Miranda, enjoys the book A Wrinkle in Time, and they debate time travel frequently, with him attempting to make points about its validity, and her getting confused. She also befriends Annamaria and Colin, two classmates with stories of their own. During their lunchtime, they get jobs helping out at a sandwich shop, and are paid in food. It's then that she starts receiving the notes. Each one mentions an event that will (and does) happen in the future, and each asks for her to record the events of her life from then on.     The story continues to bounce back and forth between the present tale of the game show preparation and the back story of Miranda, leading up to an ultimate climax that ties everything together, from the Laughing Man's strange behavior to the mysterious notes, aging Miranda in the process. It's easy to note her change through subtle realizations; although very timid, it's notable at the end.     The book was brilliantly done, and incorporates aspects of science fiction, mystery and coming of age genres. Yes, it does incorporate time travel (with strong references to A Wrinkle in Time), but it does it extremely well. It's hard to write an original time traveling story, but Rebecca Stead finds a way to do it. I think mostly because the book isn't ABOUT time travel, the action is just a connecting factor. The true story lies in Miranda's maturation process, childhood friendships, and the family bond. The time travel doesn't feel forced, it feels natural, practical.     Stead is an incredibly talented writer, who's words flow easily. She gives a strong voice to Miranda, characterizing her perfectly. My only complaint would be that I felt she made the kids act too mature for their age. Some, like Colin, were perfect - less mature, and overall goofy. Miranda, and definitely Marcus (who was, admittedly, older), were extremely knowledgeable for their age and grasped harder concepts easily. That said, I still loved both characters.     I really adored how everything wrapped up - and I mean everything. From subtle mentions to large plot points, everything comes together in the end, and it's absolutely brilliant. It shows that Stead did not waste one single word while writing - everything had a point, a message. And while I did wonder if the ending was too complex for young children (heck, it took me a few minutes to understand it all!), I applaud Stead for giving children the challenge. She doesn't dumb down her books, not at all; she guides readers through the adventures and challenges them each step of the way.     The book was brilliantly done and I envy all those who get to read it for the first time.
B000059TEP|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it. Sense then I have seen it several times more.  I have enjoyed it every time.  It makes you laugh and it makes you cry.  Its a feel good movie. The guys call it a chic flick.  Help the man in your life get in touch with his softer side.  Get him, a bowl of popcorn and sit and enjoy!
B002WJI66C|4.0|Fun item, but the 5\\" is a stretch. Perhaps 5\\" if you stretch out the tongue and measure from it to the tail. Cute, but small for the price.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|George Clooney plays an assassin/gunsmith who has \\"lost his edge,\\" thereby making himself a target in this taut thriller.  The director worked as a photographer for 35 years, therefore this film has beautiful vistas in Sweden and in a seldom-seen, arid region of Italy.<br /><br />Clooney's quiet, grim performance would be familiar to viewers who have seen him in films like \\"Michael Clayton.\\"  There's the rub; though the performances are subdued and pitch-perfect, the photography breathtaking, the plot turns are simply too predictable.  We have been here before; as the director admits, this story is the old \\"gunfighter seeks redemption\\" bit.  For example, the protagonist finds solace in the arms of a prostitute with a heart of gold.  How many times have we seen this?  It almost seems like the Eagles song \\"Desperado\\" is about to take over any moment.<br /><br />Though derivative, the film features dialogue which is crisp and understated.  At every point, there are signs of craftsmanship which redeem the tired plotline.<br /><br />The pacing of this film is leisurely by modern standards; there are no \\"Terminator 2\\" style chases - thank Goodness - which has rankled many of the viewers whose reviews are shown here.  It's clear that the director was inspired by thrillers of the late 60's and 1970's like \\"Day of the Jackal\\" and \\"Three Days of the Condor.\\"  Is \\"The American\\" equally good?  No, but it is still better than most of its modern rivals.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The Hyper 212+ is an excellent heatsink for the price.     Pros:      Low price compared to other brands such as Prolimatech, Zalman etc without sacrificing performance    It doesn't block ram slots      Cons:    Requires motherboard removal to install.  Even though my case (Cooler Master Storm Scout) has a motherboard cut-out, I needed to remove the motherboard to install the heatsink.    Instructions are non existent ( I suggest looking up installation video on youtube)    Universal backplate can be difficult to use because of the lack of detailed instructions    Fan is a tad loud      I highly recommend this heatsink for someone who wants good performance without paying too much.  I conservatively overclocked my Core i7 950 to 3.36 ghz and the temperatures never get higher that 70C at full load (using Prime 95).      Installation was a bit of the pain due to the lack of detailed instructions and universal back plate, but it wasn't too bad.  Make sure you don't over tighten the screws or it might damage your motherboard.   The installation video on youtube helped out tremendously, so I suggest watching that instead of trying to decipher the vague instructions.     The fan was a tad loud for me so I replaced it with a quieter fan (Nexus Basic).
0385342047|2.0|I don't know if I'm getting old (gasp) or this whole Rebecca Brandon (nee Bloomwood) thing is, but this book was a flop for me.  I'm sick of the immature, scatter-brained, twit act.  Becky's character is a mother now and needs to act like one.  The Nanny Sue stuff was totally selfish and reprehensible, as was most of what she did in the book.  Grow up!    I finished this book just because I hoped she would learn and grow up a bit (and also because I like to finish what I start).  I've read the entire series so far, but this may be it for me.  I'm really not sure if I'll read a sequel to this one.
B000MV90F8|5.0|first of all.....amazon deserves great credit...for many flawless transactions.....  THIS FILM IS ONE OF GREORY PECK'S GREATEST ROLES....AND SO UNSUNG......HE DESERVED AAN ACAMDEMY AWARD FOR THIS ROLE.........AMAZING ACTING BY PECK AND PLUMMER.......OUTSTANDING FILM............
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I love this movie so much from when I was a kid and now I've bought the special edition for my best friend who shares my sentiment.  Perfection :)
B002ZG981E|2.0|I give the movie 2 stars for visual effects the rest gets zero. The whole concept was totally inane and not at all good Sci-Fi. The theme had potential. Had it depicted an experiment in mind control through manipulation of dreams etc it could have been more believable and entertaining. But the film goes way beyond this and suggests that the dreams somehow become real and that some virtual action in a dream can somehow bring about real action elsewhere. And it invokes multiple depths: 'virtual to virtual to real' etc. Don't worry if you think it is more complex than you can understand. It wasn't. It was stupid.  The filming was annoying also. The action parts were excessively noisy and the dialogue parts excessively quiet. What's happened to the actor training programs? Why can't the performers speak up and enunciate their words so that we can understand what they're talking about?  Rent an old Bogart or Gary Grant or even a James Bond movie and you'll see what I mean.    In this movie you have to turn the volume down during the action sequences and turn it way up in the talking sequences.  Bottom line: The movie was a total dead loss.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Every cut on Imelda May's latest album is GREAT. Her music is fantastic. The band is amazing and her voice just gets better and better. \\"Inside Out\\" is my favorite on this album.
0817439390|5.0|My second book by this author...  I don't often take the time to provide reviews, but this book is really exceptional in my opinion.  It's well written, easy to understand, and has lovely photos as examples.  I've made several notes to take into the field.  As a new photographer (less than two years), I found it very helpful and plan to incorporate much of the information into my own work.  Kudos to Brian Peterson for writing this great book! This is my second purchase from Brian and I will be buying more.
030745455X|5.0|After reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo I couldn't wait to get into this book.<br />It's non-stop action and suspense from the beginning.  I love how the same characters are in this book.<br />Once you start reading it, make sure you have nothing else to do because you won't want to put it down for a minute.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is the my favorite book of all time and I can't wait for more to come. Screw the Twilight Saga, Stephine Meyer has nothing on Kami and Margret.!!!!! I think the reason why I love this book so much is because the authors get so in depth with the characters. Take Amma for example, they did a perfect job on a southern babtist woman who will never loose an argument. I don't even think the jersy shore girls could take on this woman. I also love this book becaiseof the forbiden love...Eathan is an amazing young man who will fight for the girl he loves even when she pushes him away. Lena is still a mystery to me...even though I've read the book like 10 times...trust me shewill suprise yo through out he entire book. This book is the best version of todays Romeo and Juliet, but with a twist. The is action, heartbreak, romance, secrets, lies, mystry and more!!! if you buy this book you will not be dissapointed.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I received the DVD very quickly but didn't get to watch it right away. When I did, the DVD froze up twice but I am not sure if it was the DVD or my player (which is possible) and I won't know until I watch it again. I am confident that if it was the DVD and I notified the seller at once that it would have been replaced. It is my fault that I am unsure.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|My son wanted this movie after we saw it in the theater.  A great story for everyone. Sports, citizenship, team morale and family situations. Get this movie!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought this cable from Amazon and then read some of the reviews about how some of them were defective and so I wasn't sure what to expect. But Amazon has delivered again. Simple high quality stuff, for a decent price. I just use it for the TV in my room, works perfectly without any hassles. The product is made in China though, but I figure, with the way things are nowadays, most of my home was probably made in China anyway, so it doesn't bother me. Bottom line...it works!
B003IVDPC8|5.0|Just beautiful work from both Carole King and James Taylor. This is an album not to be missed by fans old and young. As another reviewer said, you listen to the music and find yourself \\"face down in the 70's.\\" I loved the 70's and was happy to have the chance to hear many of my favorite songs of all time on this magnificent album.
B003WTE886|1.0|I ordered item and never received it.  When I tracked the item through usps.com, it stated it was delivered.  Somehow I never got it.  I experienced several other online purchasing blunders so I aim to stop buying online.  Extremely aggrivating.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have a *great* deal of difficulty with some of the views Orson Scott Card has espoused over the years, but I'm willing to put all that aside in praise of a truly extraordinary work of science fiction.<br /><br />Ender's Game is one of those books you'll re-read every few years and get more out of each time you do.<br /><br />There's a heck of a lot of food for thought in these pages, and the potential for some very wrong headed conclusions to be drawn, but Ender's evolution is something every science fiction fan, and maybe every fiction fan, should experience for themselves.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This film is a great wrap up to the series \\"Firefly\\". Action, adventure, romance, sci-fi, cowboys...what more could you ask for?
0307595579|5.0|This set is the definitive collection of Stieg Larsson's three books.  They are hardbound books with distinctively colored cloth covers.  And they have maps.  The map of Hedeby Island that should have been included in all copies of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, plus a map of Sweden that shows most of the cities/towns mentioned in the trilogy, and two different maps of the Stockholm area, so the reader can familiarize him/herself with the country's geography.  Stieg Larsson's books and Lisbeth are worldwide phenomena--this set also tells about the author and his untimely death in a slim fourth volume.  And as usual amazon.com gave a low price and excellent service.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I've been promising myself the entire season of the West Wing for a while now; and when I saw that Amazon was offering all 8 years at a discount, I jumped.    The series is an addiction. Creator Aaron Sorkin has created an alternative universe full of smart people saying clever things as they go about saving the world. It's a place that's very hard to quit.    The packaging of the boxed set is clever.  It comes in what appears to be an official White House document box, and inside each year comes in its own folder.    The boxed set offers all the episodes, charting the full arc of the Bartlett presidency; along with commentaries from the writers,directors and stars of the series.    Included is a shooting script from the pilot episode and a second book with stills from the series, breaking down each year of series, with a brief description of each episode.     Being able to sit and watch whole seasons in a short time span helps highlight how groundbreaking The West Wing was, and is. There is little on the air today that looks, and sounds like it. And, it expects much from the viewers. Serious political, social, and cultural discussions take place in the 40-some odd minutes. And all sides get to have their say. Some may call it political fiction; but the issues facing President Bartlett are still with us now. And The West Wing takes great pleasure is challenging both left and right political positions.    So, is it entertainment?- Yes.  Is it an education?- Yes. Is it worth your time and money?--Yes, Yes, Yes.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|Double cd arrived a little bit late due to Christmas traffic,packaged perfectly.The album is Fantastic digitally mastered and a really cool spread of their best tracks.Just luv it!
1577311760|5.0|I got the CD so I could listen on my 45 minute drive to and from work. It has given me my life back. I didn't expect much and it wasn't instant gratification.  However after the first 15 minutes, I realized this was just what I needed.  The information changed my life forever.   I have happiness, freedom and peace that I thought I did not deserve. I learned I do deserve this amd more and I am so much happier than I ever imagined I could be. Just do this one thing for yourself!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|If you like older science fiction films than this is a film you must see. I know living in 2010 a science fiction film is supposed to be really advanced as far as special effects but for a film made in the 1950's this isn't bad. It has a good story line too it as well. I give it five stars I used to watch this with my dad growing up and when my dad came to visit me over the holidays I had to rent it.
B001AIRUP4|1.0|The main reason I purchased this item was for the Digital Copy. Come to find out in very small print on the lower back it says the Digital Copy Expired back in 2008! Since it is 2010, the item should not be sold with the Digital Copy if it is EXPIRED! Amazon should no longer sell this product, especially since they sell a more recent version wothout the expired digital copy. Plus, they should post this in the item description notifying all cutomers of the expiration date. This would have saved me a lot of time if I would have known this in the first place. I had to go through the trouble of returning the item and waiting for a refund!
B000PXUA5W|4.0|This LEGO watch comes with plenty of color bands (blue, yellow, red, green among others) to reproduce your kid's favorite team - it's not only black and white.  At this time, however, black and white are sufficient.    The wrist strap extension process took a total of about 10' since we did not have previous experience with a LEGO watch - an infinity, of course, when a kid wants to use it _immediately_. It is straightforward, though.    Bonus: a LEGO character!    Our godson will be learning the time the good ol' fashion way.  Any LEGO watch, at this price point and for the intended use, is highly recommended. You can always \\"pass on your *a-hem* Patek Philippe\\" later in life... ;-)

B004G8ZZHU|4.0|I like movies like this, serious enough to have a story, yet enough fun to keep it from being to heavy :)    I liked this movie way better than the original TV show I watched as a kid. I think Rampage made an awesome Mr.T. I liked all the characters better than the original TV show except for Mr.T which I would give a tie to. (gotta love the old Mr. T also)    I also like how this movie put together pieces of the original TV series to explain things. For example why Mr. T is afraid of flying lol.    Fun movie for sure, yet serious enough to have meaning.
0440111498|4.0|Vonnegut has a penchant for writing books that are deeply thoughtful, incredibly funny, and absolutely depressing. Cat's Cradle forefronts two main themes: (1) humanity has an insurmountable tendency to destroy itself and (2) nothing really matters anyway. Telling the story of a random set of characters thrown together by an inexorable sense of chance, chaos ensues and we laugh all the way to the end of the world. Science, in this book, is not your friend (scientists even less so) and religion, though a heap of lies, is a little more friendly when taken with a healthy grain of salt.<br /><br />in all, the book is good. great even. worth a read and certainly enlightening. but, like Salinger, Vonnegut embraces an incredible cynicism. the sarcasm makes it a bit more fun, but there is little redeemable at the end of the narrative. just take you poison and bid goodnight.
B0045XICB2|3.0|This movie was ok, that is about it.     The first 2 rocked the house. I felt like this movie was not necessary if you watched the first 2.     Yes, this movie did give some extra backround to certain characters, but....    Worth watching, yes....just don't expect it to be near as good as the first two in my opinion.
B0042816YK|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I started working on my laptop during it, it was that bad!  Julia Roberts' chararcter never gave me a reason to care about her, much less about her wanting to go on a year's self pity trip.  The dialogue was excruciating to hear.  I want a refund for 2 hours of my life I won't ever get back.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I kept stumbling across this book and put off purchasing it.  It truly is not a book that I would have purchasing in a bookstore, simply not my type of read.  It was the reviews that pushed me into this purchase, and I am so glad that I did.  I could not put this book down.  \\"The Book Thief\\" in all of her existence tugged at my heart.  Such a sad little life she led, but one filled with love and wonder, and so many teachings.  The Book Thief is a MUST READ!

B001GWK2MC|1.0|Don't buy this if you are looking for a bouncer because it does not bounce at all. Mine also came with a busted wall that wont hold air. If you are simply looking for a fort than ok, but I wouldn't waste any money on this.

B000TSJU0E|5.0|Initially, I was not impressed with the remastering of Eliminator. \\"Gimme all your Lovin\\",and \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" don't sound all that great on this cd to me. \\"Got me under pressure\\" ups the ante though,and when \\"I need your love tonight\\" cranks up all I can say is \\"Wow!!\\". The sound is very clean and muscular for the remainder of the cd. Very impressive! I've heard the remasters from Eliminator done by George Marino for the Chrome,Smoke,and BBQ box set,and the Rancho Texicano collection might sound better to some though. I never bought Eliminator on cd,but I have the LP from way back when. It was good to hear some cuts on the album (besides the big hits) that I had not heard in probably 20 years or more again!    The packaging is fine,but the extras on the cd are terrible. The live tracks sound terrible just like the ones on Tres Hombres and Fandango. I can't speak for the DVD as I haven't gotten around to watching it yet.    This is a very important album that has been done justice by Warner Bros. It could've been better,but it's a very good package overall.    This was the commercial peak for ZZ,but I still say the pre-Eliminator stuff is the best. I've really enjoyed the band's later work from Rythmeen on up to Mescalero,and I'm patiently waiting for that new album that's way overdue. I had the honor of seeing ZZ Top last year,and the band is still in fine form. Billy is still the best,and Dusty and Frank rule as well.

1594201749|4.0|The author raises this question toward the end of this very good book. It's a legitimate one to ask. Mandela takes on an almost supernatural aura as the action unfolds.<br /><br />Playing the Enemy chronicles the birth of post apartheid South Africa and the unexpected role in this of an epic sports contest. It follows Mandela from the beginnings of his contacts with government officials while still in prison, through his triumphant release and election as President. But all this simply provides context for the narrative of a rugby match.<br /><br />And what a match it was.<br /><br />Mandela understood that before a new country of South Africa could come into being, what was required was the creation of a population of South Africans, something that had not existed in the era of the Afrikaners and numerous fragmented tribal groups. He seized on the sport of rugby as the unlikely vehicle to make this happen. Rugby had been the exclusive province of the Boer oppressors, and the name and colors of the national team were vilified among the black population. Mandela's amazing leadership turned this around, and the sight of black masses cheering for the Springboks conveyed a potent message of forgiveness and reconciliation.<br /><br />Read this book to replenish your hope in human potential and possibilities.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|This film is undeniably a classic.  I have loved it for a long time, having seen it on vhs back in highschool.  I love to purchase films that merit repeated viewings, so purchasing this dvd was a no-brainer.     Unfortunately, the dvd has been somewhat disapointing in terms of image quality, especially compared to my dvd copy of Zabriskie Point, which is visually stunning.  And if it is true, as another reviewer suggests, that certain key scenes have been cut, this is a major disappointment!    This classic film deserves a fully restored, high quality blu-ray and dvd release. Right away!    On another note, many reviewers suggest that the film has a \\"dated\\" feel.  I actually think that Antonioni portrayed the then-current fashion and music trends in a oddly detached way that makes them seem trivial and shallow, to make a point. The film is definitely a time capsule, yet it never buys into the trappings of the era.
B001PHTPDU|5.0|If you want to know why our politics are the way they are you must read this book! It will make sense if you do.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|What can I say, Dido is awesome.  She really owns the stage and gives a unforgettable performance.  This is a DVD that you will watch over and over.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I had no desire to watch this but was forced by my teenaged neices.  But I thoroughly enjoyed it!  The characters are likeable, the animation is wonderful, and the story is cute.  Great for all ages!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|If you are a fan of the BeeGees or Celine Dion you will absolutely enjoy this as your best DVD or CD ever. I bought the DVD and the CD and listen and watch both most of the time. I initially bought this for my mom and watched it with her. My brother watched it also with her. After my mom past it became the most harm warming music to soothe the soul especially the song \\"Immortality\\" by Celine Dion with the BeeGees. I bought it for my brother at Christmas and it was the best present he could have gotten. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.
B000VJ271A|5.0|Dessay is simply delightful in voice, acting, diction, and voice,  voice, voice, voice.  Villazon is definitely just as good. Even his diction is not bad, far better than Domingo any day. Alas, Ramey is worse than a disappointment. Production is bizarre - in an arena???? Sets are scanty but effective.      Definitely recommend this Manon. Dessay and Villazon make this an excellent Manon.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|i just bought this book and i read through it in 2 days. it was awesome. if you liked the percy jacksom books them youll definitly wana read this. or if you havnt read the old series then read this anyway. do it now before i send you to tarterus
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Yes it is.  You will never see a \\"Horror\\" movie like this one.  I've read all the praise from \\"Irreversible\\" and it doesn't even compare to Martyrs.   This movie was so different then ANY other Horror movie you'll ever see.    This movie is in your face and just absolutely stunning with its story.  This is one of the very few movies that left thinking about it for weeks.  As a viewer of hundreds of Horror films, this one takes the top spot.     The only down spot for this movie was the subtitles.
0525951113|5.0|When my husband suggested this to me, I thought he was joking. Leaving reviews on amazon is perhaps my most advanced computer skill and I'm just not a scifi/technie type...but geez! I couldn't put this book down! And as an aside---I rarely *love* books--I'm horribly critical with novels!! (I almost never leave reviews because I hate being the lone person giving 1 or 2 stars!)..but I'd give this one 6!<br /><br />And although this book had long parts and some unnecessary storyline (that a good editor would have nixed) it was really a page-turner -- It's going to make a fantastic movie---and never has any book made me rush to download its sequel quite like this one did! I was barely finished, and already downloading Freedom.
B0048LPRD2|5.0|Having seen this movie already, I very much want it on blue ray.     Its graphic, like to the point where its going to cross a number of people's \\"comfort zones\\" by more than a little bit.     I want to give the director of photography a hug, because filming a grater than 2 hour long movie from what is mostly a view looking down on the action flying around through the world of tokyo must have been hell....     This movie is like nothing you have ever seen, it is a visionary look at the experience of death. Nothing is held back, all of the terrible and amazing moments of ones life come to the surface all at once and you simply just fall into the void.     Focused on drugs, death, and a retrospective of the protagonist's life from the perspective of the viewer simply along for the ride.    One of the most unique and visionary movies I have ever seen.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is a bit offtopic, but I'd like to be sure the blu-ray series will work on my BD player.

Anyone to help about this ?    Thank you.

B0006IIKS0|4.0|The documentary's great value comes when the new bassist has been chosen, the album is completed, they start touring behind it, and they are absolutely great on stage. Then it hits you: All the bickering, the whining, the petulance, the back-stabbing, the inarticulate posturing, and the frustration have been necessary parts of the creative process: these all-too-flawed, all-too-human guys work out, haltingly, what it takes for them to pool their talents and produce something fantastic. And you realize, I wasn't in the locker rooms of the Celtics and Yankees and 49er teams that won all those championships, and I've never been backstage to see ballet dancers and symphony orchestra musicians and Miles Davis's combos interact, but I've got to guess it all would have elements of Lars,James, and Kirk's working out how to get it done.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great movie. It's a shame though that Sandra Bullock felt the need to bring some tarnish to her name with the lesbian actions she did after this movie went public.
0312600844|1.0|Oprah, I love you and I usually agree with your book club selections but, this one, you missed the boat on.  Look, I'm one of those people who feels quilty when I do not finish a book but I could only take 180 pages and I was kaput.  This is a rambling wreck from start to finish.  OK, I can understand the allure of reading about familial angst and dysfunctional relationships but the plot in this story is not believable.  The dialogue is not believable.  The relationships are not believable.  The intermingling of characters is not believable.  The yoyo-like relationship between Patty and Richard (personal and sexual) was dizzying.  Richard's on-again, off-again loyalty (or disloyalty) to Walter is maddening.  All of these characters seem to turn collective 180s before your very eyes.  I guess some people really do that but all of them at the same time?  Frankly, the book was a disappointment and not very interesting.  I guess I am the one that is off-base here because it seems that this book is listed in every top ten 2010 fiction category for every book critic.  So, I apologize for being such a downer but I just don't get it!
B00007KLJJ|5.0|This is a awesome movie about loyalty,friendship,courage and love. It also has great battle seens a must see for anyone.

B0037AGASG|1.0|As I listen to tracks from this album, it is even worse than I imagined it could be. This kid is obviously a smartly manufactured and marketed \\"talent\\" packaged to young girls. His music videos sell teen romance fantasies and not the music. What is sad is that this garbage gets so much attention and obscures real talent, because money talks when many of the young and unsophisticated girls out there are drawn to this and feel the need to join the hysteria. The Beatles caused an even greater hysteria with girls in the 1960's, but of course, they actually had real talent. This kid is without any significant talent and has a weak voice requiring much studio doctoring on albums. The live performances are embarrassingly pathetic. Justin may get millions of You Tube hits, but there are usually twice as many \\"dislikes\\" as \\"likes,\\" and the poor overall consumer rating of this album on Amazon speaks for itself. Being 16 years old is not an excuse, as youngsters have displayed amazing talent at 16 or even younger ages. Taylor Swift and Allison Krause were showing considerable actual talent at this age. There is no better current example than 16 year-old fellow Canadian Nikki Yanofsky, who is receiving stellar reviews from the public, fellow musicians and critics alike-and on You Tube and Amazon. Krause and Yanofsky both had great first albums at age 13. If you think Justin's work on this album is talent and real music, do yourself a favor and explore real music and talent elsewhere.

B000P0J09C|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is an outstanding film that grabbed my attention by the throat and never let go until the very last frame of the picture! The acting mesmerized me; it was all done so convincingly and nobody--but nobody--gives a bad performance in this film. The script was well written; the casting well done; and the cinematography and choreography enhance the film as well. The musical score enhances the plot as it moves along; and it's a plot that never left me feeling bored. But please note: this film contains a lot of profanity and graphic, violent war scenes; I would not recommend this film for small children as it might frighten them.<br /><br />Many have noted that the film seems to be presented in two parts; and I would agree with that. The first part takes place on Parris Island, South Carolina, a boot camp for new Marines during the Vietnam War in the 1960s.  The new recruits have to endure incredibly grueling conditions and training by their leader Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) who pulls no punches as he trains them \\"to be killers.\\" Among the new recruits are Private Joker (Matthew Modine); Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio who plays this to perfection and beyond) and Arliss Howard as Private Cowboy. Private Joker turns out to be quite well suited for the Marines but he is eventually assigned to report for the Stars and Stripes newspaper over in Vietnam; Joker also tries very hard to prepare the ill-suited Private Pyle for combat as a Marine.  However, the stress does take its toll and the first part of the film ends with a tragedy that shows the horrible impact of war even before overseas combat begins.<br /><br />The film then somewhat abruptly changes to military life in and around Hue, Vietnam in 1968; we meet up again with Joker (who now wears a peace button on his uniform) and others including Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), who works for Stars and Stripes as a cameraman alongside Joker; and they do get along very well. Things don't stay happy for long as Rafterman's camera is stolen and both Joker and Rafterman become involved covering the action.  Look also for excellent performances by Adam Baldwin as a Marine who goes by the name \\"Animal Mother;\\" \\"Eightball\\" (Dorian Harewood) and Ed O'Ross as Lt.\\" Touchdown.\\"<br /><br />I could tell you so much more about the action and the tough decisions they and others must make during some of the brutal action in the Tet Offensive; but then again I'd be spoiling it for you. Of course, some survive and others don't; and the sniper scenes are some of the most riveting I've ever watched in any motion picture.<br /><br />Full Metal Jacket is an excellent film with a message that war is horrific; and the acting will amaze you. I highly recommend this film for people studying the Vietnam War; people interested in gritty war dramas will not be disappointed.  The film also explores the issues of duty, honor and sacrifice alongside a moral ambiguity many soldiers grappled with while they carried on the fight.Rafterman's camera is stolen and both Joker and Rafterman become involved covering the action.

Brand Blvd, Glendale, CA) when I wandered in there looking to see if maybe some of my favorite authors had published anything new that I had missed.<br /><br />After much discussion, she recommended Rothfuss' debut novel, saying that no one she had recommended it to had been disappointed. She was correct.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is the best fantasy book I have read in a long, long time.<br /><br />It has a number of features that make it similar to other very popular and classic works in the genre, such as: a story within a story, the ubiquity of magic instead of science and technology, a school (university) setting where magic is taught to impressionable teens, an orphaned protagonist anda trio of friends that includes the central character.<br /><br />The author has announced that The Name of the Wind will be the first book in a trilogy, called The Kingkilller Chronicles. The next book, called The Wise Man Fear is set to be released on April 19, 2009. I can't wait!<br /><br />Rothfuss has made me consider reading fantasy again and expanded the list of authors whose work I have begun reading, which include China Mieville and Scott Lynch. There are also several others who I haven't even gotten around to reading yet: Joe Abercrombie's First Law series, Hal Duncan's Vellum and Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's The Shadow of the Wind.<br /><br />These last two are suggestions by the good people at Mystery & Imagination. I'll get to them after reading the The Wise Man's Fear or the end of the semester--whichever comes first!<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is 736 pages long in the mass-market paperback edition released April 1, 2008.<br /><br />PLOT: A.<br />IMAGERY: A+.<br />IMPACT: A-.<br />WRITING: A.<br />OVERALL GRADE: A.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the best of the trilogy by Mr. Larson.  I enjoyed all of the twists, turns, and suprises.  He is excellent at keeping the reader riveted to her seat.  I really liked Lisbeth and her antics.  She proved that just because she was small, she should not be taken lightly.  Finally, a central female character that wasn't perfect but was smart and resourceful. I really liked her and  am sorry that this is the last book in the series.
B000002KB8|5.0|After spending an incredibly indulgent afternoon in LA's Amoeba records, I emerged with a bagful of music that I hadn't listened to in years...and The original Black Sabbath effort has been an incredibly enlightening revisit.....    The MOST AMAZING thing I found returning to this album after 30+ years was the INCREDIBLE PREMONITION of Ozzie's first ever recorded lyric - line 1 from song 1 -.....\\"What is this that stands before me???\\"    Many have written that much started here - goth, metal, satanic forboding - How did he know??????
0312600844|4.0|This is an epic story told over a thirty year time period. It has three main characters, Walter and Patty Berglund, and Walter's best friend Richard Katz. Others pop in and out of the story but the action centers on these three. We first come to know them in their college years in Minnesota. Walter is a straight arrow character, very rigid but appealing if not exciting. Richard is the dark side - a nihilistic musician attractive to women for all of the wrong reasons. Patty is an athlete on a basketball scholarship to Minnesota. She is an interesting character with numerous contradictions. Patty is attracted to Richard but ends up making the safer choice of Walter. We are treated to an in depth look at their early married years as gentrifying yuppies in an up and coming St. Paul neighborhood. We also get an examination of the families of Walter and Patty. Walter and Patty have a supportive even loving married life but Patty continues to be attracted to Richard. In a plot turn that I found somewhat hard to believe the liberal environmentally conscious Berglunds allow their 15 year old son Joey to move in with the red neck next store neighbors and carry on an openly sexual relationship with the neighbors' daughter.<br /><br />During a midlife crisis, Patty succumbs to temptation and sleeps with Richard during a two day stay at the Berglund's' remote lake cottage. This destroys the marriage for Patty but Walter is unaware of the breach of trust. Walter accepts a position as executive director of an environmental trust agency in D.C. and he and Patty move east. The setup for them is again fairly strange. They live in a house owned by the trust and share living quarters with Walter's assistant, an attractive young Indian-American. Patty continues in a deep depression. Events accelerate at this point. Richard reappears and betrays to Walter Patty's indiscretion, the Berglund son Joey becomes in involved in international arms dealing (again to me a widely improbable event) and the Berglund marriage falls apart. Walter takes up with his assistant and essentially has a breakdown that causes him to leave his job and indulge a life style more reminiscent of the 70s than the new millennium. The assistant, Lalitha, is killed in a car accident and Walter retreats to a hermit like existence at the lake cottage in Minnesota. Patty tries staying with Richard but pines for her life with Walter. The ending that brings Patty and Walter reconciled and back together is very satisfying.<br /><br />Let me apologize for a plot summary that reads like a soap opera, but condensing 570 pages into a couple of paragraphs with my poor skills  inevitably reduces the story in a cartoonish way. This was an entertaining and very readable book. It is certainly a modern novel for the new millennium about people who I found interesting though I did have trouble relating to them. The story is entertaining in and of itself, without looking for any other levels of meaning. Franzen is a talented writer, some of his prose rings so true and is so amusingly descriptive that you just need to stop and savor it. There are lots of references to Tolstoy throughout the book and while this family is certainly unhappy in its own unique way, there are no great characters here in my opinion. Maybe that in itself says something about the modern world but while I enjoyed this story and loved the prose I felt cheated in the end that these people were not really worth my time.Berglund marriage falls apart.

B00005QXXO|2.0|I didn't like this album much. I am, of course, a huge fan of radiohead but this album was so much less than I expected. The songs seemed to suffer from a lack of fullness (on the whole there are fewer instruments playing the songs than on the studio versions - not that that is necessarily a bad thing but I think in this case it is), and an excess of noise - both from the audience and all the crazy gadgets that radiohead like to use in their music (and this certainly isn't helped by the poor quality of the recording). The album, as other reviewers have pointed out, is also quite short. Well...., actually it isn't all that short - about 40 minutes - but there aren't many tracks on it which is disappointing.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|Hollywood shows their disdain for our way of life by making our descendants look like aggressive oppressors. If you can allow your imagination to take over and get past that, the inhabitants of the planet Andora are heroic in their endeavor to protect their planet and their way of life. The story is interesting and the special effects make the show worth watching a second or third time.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I think Rick did a great job on his book. I like how he brings in that gods can losethe will t live and then proves it with pan.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|I regret that I've only gotten around to seeing the last season of Ugly Betty just now.  I've been a fan of the show since I saw the first episode and during the last season I was quite busy with work and wasn't able to enjoy the final season of one of my favorite TV shows of recent years.  While bigger shows (that I also enjoyed such as Lost and 24) may have gotten bigger fanfare in their exits from the small screen, I think Betty's final bow was as poignant and touching as any finale I've seen.<br /><br />  I was saddened to hear that the show was ending but perhaps it was the right time for the show.  The last season ended on a high note.  They tied up some loose ends, allowed us to see some of Betty's old flames (Henry and Gio) and allowed Hilda to finally find true love (with CSI Miami's Adam Rodriquez).  Rather than rely on huge stars to pepper the final season (like Shakira, who was in an episode) they instead gave us the things that we've come to love about Ugly Betty---the great Wilomena one liners, the crazy antics of Marc and Amanda, the dedication of the Suarez family and the true spirit of Betty. What most of us loved about Betty was her determination to succeed and her belief in her dreams; something I think most of us can relate to.  While along there way there was lots of outlandish comic soap opera-esque moments, there were also scenes and storylines that were well done and life affirming. The storyline with Justin and his coming out were very sweet and sent a positive message to gay teenagers who may be struggling with the same questions and worries in their own lives.  And the Suarez clan's support and love for their gay teenager is an example as well to family members who find that they have a gay teen or family member.  One of the most memomorable scenes of the final 4 or 5 episodes has Justin coming out to his family by dancing with his boyfriend at his mom's wedding.  Its a subtle, lovely scene that is one of the best of the entire series.  It was also great to see a show that gave voice to the latin community and presented latinos in the limelight for a change.<br /><br />  I'll miss the wicked schemes of Wilomena, portrayed to a tee by the talented Vanessa Williams, Marc and Amanda's unyielding catty remarks and the charm of America Ferrera, for whom without the series would have never been a success.  Her turn as Betty was someone who we could all identify with and root for and her gradual transformation revealed the beauty of the woman inside.  Betty never gave up on her goals or herself and made the choices that were right for her, a positive role model for young women.  She may have become more aware of fashion but she never abandoned who she truly was.<br /><br />  I'll definitely add this final season to my dvd collection.  I'm glad we got to know Betty.....and I'm glad that at the end of the show, they dropped the \\"ugly\\" from the title as the final scene faded to black.  Betty may not have been a fashionista to begin with but she was beautiful on the inside.  Highly recommended!It was also great to see a show that gave voice to the latin community and presented latinos in the limelight for a change.

B000UR9QGW|4.0|Evil Dead 2 is a marked improvement over its predecessor in every way. Director Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell created one of the most memorable horror icons when they introduced the 'boomstick'. Equal parts shocking and hilarious, this sequel is evidence of a director who knew how to push the right buttons in his audience.
B003INBOEC|1.0|I was looking for the English version of the movie and this was not it.  I would like to return this product for a refund.
B003IY48PS|4.0|Before Sam Raimi became a household name for his work on the Spider-man movies, he earned a rep as a master of visceral horror flicks. The Evil Dead is the first of the his deadite trilogy and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash, an everyman thrown into a decidedly unusual situation. The plot is simple, but perfectly functional. What drives this film is Raimi's keen understanding of the audience. The camera and pacing is tight, allowing little room for the audience to catch a breath. This results in a rush which only the very best of horror movies can produce. Although the effects have aged, there is no denying that The Evil Dead was an early sign of the young Raimi's gift behind the camera.
B004927I50|4.0|We bought this as a gift for our grand daughter. It was received on time and the service was excellent.
B00004WNHC|5.0|Catch a Fire started it all and it's great that they reprinted this in vinyl format.  Although I would rather have the original zippo styled record case, this will do for now.  Excellent album and a must for any vinyl collection.  Buy it!
B001CTUI8M|5.0|This concert has an excellent picture quality and great audio.  Performance is incredible, singer Sharon delivers from the start  and continues at the same level all the way to the end. Orchestra  brings grandiosity to the whole event.    Audience responds enthusiastically as the songs passes and some  guests musicians accentuate the overall quality of the entire  production.    It's one of the few blu-ray concerts of the genre (Symphonic Gothic Metal)  and it does justice indeed.    I watched this on my 85 inch screen and 1080p projector and I was blown away  by this concert. 5 star.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|Creationary is a great spin on an old classic game like Pictionary.  Plenty of Lego pieces to build just about anything you need for the game.  Beware...the difficult cards do have some doozies, especially in the building category.  Definitely sparks your creativity.  The Lego-challenged may find it difficult to try to build things instead of drawing them.  However for old Lego buffs like myself, or new ones like my nine-year-old son, the game is a blast.  Basically he and I ended up doing most of the building during the game and his little sister and my wife would do most of the guessing since they weren't as good at building.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars overall is I would have preferred to have a game board to go with the game to provide more of a set goal to reach.  Lego has definitely raised the bar with this and their other new games.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Andrea Bocelli's \\"My Christmas\\" is truly a wonderful Christmas show. There is such a warm Christmas feel throughout the entire concert. \\"My Christmas\\" is a instant classic that could become one of your families Christmas traditions.
0525951652|4.0|Nothing so far will surpass the superiority of novel, Pillars of the Earth.  However, the first of the trilogy, Fall of Giants is well-written and engaging.  Perhaps those which follow will be better, although high expectations tend to be disappointing.
B002ZG976U|5.0|this movie was awesome in my opinion.the dancing, the music, everthing. its makes you just want to get up and move. i watched this movie and im the one who wanted to be up there on stage. christinas' voice is unbelievable where she gets that voice who knows and cher included ....awesome
031603438X|5.0|I usually shy away from celebrity bios; they tend to be self-serving and they leave out all the good parts. Not this one! KR has done a terrific job of recreating Stones World from the '60's onward. The spell really is compete.  His love of music is a big part of the book's charm. Some may find all of the technical explanations a bit much but I loved them. Richards talks to the reader as if he or she is a fellow traveler and that's a rare thing in an autobiography. Enjoy every page -- I did.
0689865384|5.0|This is unlike any YA book I've read. It captured my attention and kept it. When I was finished, I immediately downloaded the next installment, Pretties. I'd recommend it to everyone.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|My kids received this game as a gift for Christmas so we opened it up and have played a few times and to summarize, it's been fun.      The game is essentially Pictionary with Legos.  You roll a die and draw a card to see what it is you are going to try to build, and the other players try to guess what you're building.  When someone guesses correctly, the person who guessed gets points and the person who built gets points.    There are different ways to play, but since we played with young kids and it was important to keep their attention, we didn't take turns guessing, everyone just shouted when they had an idea.  We also set a timer so that if it wasn't guessed after 5 minutes, no one got points and we moved on to the next player.    We had players from age 5 on up to 70+, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  My only concern is that after a few plays you will start to remember what's on the cards and it will make the guessing easier.  Also, it is sometimes hard to tell what the card is telling you to build.  It would have been nice to label them, even if this might have added to the production cost.      Like other Lego games, you're encouraged to change the rules to make the game more fun.  There are options included for team vs. team games or couple vs. couple.  There are different ways you can organize the guessing, and you can always create your own build items using handwritten notes instead of the included cards.  It may also be fun to use other lego pieces from other sets instead of confining yourself to what's in the box.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|LOVED this film. Hadn't seen many trailors and hadn't read the book, didn't know what to expect. Totally messed with my mind and thought about it for long time afterwards. Will definately be watching again. Wish there were more films like this. Acting was fantastic and the movie was so well made and thought out...worked a treat :)
B0042MEQVG|3.0|I found this last dvd of the series to be just alright......nothing exciting. I may have given it second thoughts as far as purchasing it had I rented it before. If you are looking for closure, you are not going to get it. If you have the first 2 in this series you might as well have this one too. Otherwise it's not worth the money. Just rent it.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The story was pretty good. It was annoying to me that all the characters kept saying \\"ok,ok\\". Americans written by a Brit I guess. I hope that improved in future Reacher books.
0486268659|5.0|This is a fantastic edition of Charles Dickens' classic holiday story of Ebenezer Scrooge's transition from Miser to Man of the People. It is unabridged (original text that includes wonderful lines such as \\"solitary as an oyster\\") and bound well for a smaller paperback. An excellent edition for an unbeatable price!  For a gift idea, tie these books with ribbon and gave them as gifts to coworkers, neighbors, and even as stocking stuffers; I did, and they were a terrific hit.
0439023491|5.0|My son has read this non stop the past two days, and just can't put it down.  It takes a great book to make him want to read, so this must be a good one!  He loves this whole series.
B00006AL1G|5.0|This was a gift to my boyfriend.  He is just getting into Dj-ing.  He loves music, and this movie is pretty freaking awesome.  From Dj Shadow to Mix Master Mike.  Gives a nice insight as to what inspires them to spin.  For the amount of money I paid, this movie is a steal.
B000KKPN5C|3.0|Just processed my images from the first use of this flash on my D300S. Oddly enough all the images came out too dark. I had to enhance every one with Aperture. Did not get any red-eye with this flash and it is compact and has no settings. Like the ease of use. Amateur photographer.
B002ZG98LO|1.0|I dont normally feel compelled to write reviews here, but I finished this movie five minutes ago and I felt I should warn against this. I love a good action movie, I enjoyed the original movie. I know how to shut my brain off and enjoy a movie. Sadly this movie was just...boring. The trailer was more entertaining as a whole.   Supposedly the predators rounded up the most dangerous of Earth's warriors to hunt. However, someone forgot to teach the actors how to act like deadly warriors. Not for one second do you lose the sensation that you are just watching actors walking around holding guns. I mean if you are gonna give the actors lines like \\"I work better alone\\" it better comes across as genuine or as some sort of homage to classic action flicks. This movie achieves neither.   I found myself checking facebook during the climax of the movie, and I am the type to normally get irritated at people who do that kind of thing. I could list more complaints but this movie doesn't even warrant that sort of passionate dislike. It's more like total indifference. Save yourself the time. It isnt worth the dollar at a rental kiosk.
B00406UK7S|5.0|I was hoping for an interesting movie about ancient rome and this is it. Based upon the historical discussion of the disappearance of the 9th legion. For a low budget film, the acting is good and the costumes and photography are great. The story was interesting and fast paced. I can't believe this was not released more broadly in the theaters. Loved this movie and wish there were more like it.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for this movie - there's been too many poorly executed 80's TV/Movie conversions. But I rather enjoyed it. Just a good, fun, buddy-type action flick.
B002ZG9940|5.0|Im so very sorry to see so many low ratings for such a fantastic film. I'm sure this is due to people just wanting more of the same garbage that is already out there and being disappointed by something they almost certainly found to be boring and empty. However this film is incredibly sophisticated, subtle, methodical, and intense. This is not a fast paced action film. This is a meticulously crafted work of art by one incredibly talented filmmaker. A character study where the viewer must be on his toes to pick up the paranoia that the protagonist is experiencing. It's gorgeously shot, handsomely acted by Clooney, and an absolute delight to watch. This is for people who love sophisticated yet subtle cinema. I can also see this films roots in the 70s and can only hope this is the start of a building trend. This is a 5 star film and is being misunderstood and misrepresented by those giving it 1 star.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Dickens and have read it a number of times. Like all movies, this one took some creative license in its making. Despite what others have said, there are a number of segments from the Dicken's story left out. There is also a relatively long \\"chase\\" scene involving the ghost of Christmas future that I found...boring...and misplaced. Really? Scrooge shrinking to the size of a mouse? Other than that, the movie is in the GOOD category... not GREAT... good... not as good as TBS's \\"A Christmas Carol\\" with Patrick Stewart; and certainly not as great as the 1951 version with Alistair Sim... It is animated, and there are advantages with that as far as special effects go, otherwise, it's a keeper and worth watching again.
B002ZG981E|3.0|I really appreciate most of Christopher Nolan's work, especially \\"Memento\\" and \\"The Prestige\\". The original \\"Inception\\" script was apparently written ten years ago. However, Nolan seems to have realised that the overall concept, while strikingly original, has too many logical flaws and made a pure action movie instead of something resembling those earlier movies. Why would people meet up in their respective dreams just because they both sleep in the first place? What, or Who, decides who is in or out? This, and many other odd ideas like dream architecture, aren't dealt with properly, presumably because doing so would expose the fragility of it all. Instead of plot puzzles and character development we're treated to action sequences and CGI effects. The main characters are of comic book depth and it's hard to care whether DiCaprio's character Cobb and his gang of cardboard assistants succeed or not. In my view, Nolan should have pared down the number of main characters to half and given those left more profile. The only scenes that really stick in the mind feature Cobb's relationship with his wife (oddly, those scenes are the only ones where some actual psychology enters this dream-based picture). To summarise, an OK movie but it doesn't stick in the mind the way some of Nolan's earlier work does.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is so amazing! Suzanne Collins is an awesome writer and knows exactly what twists to put in the plot. As you read the last book of the thrilling trilogy will keeps you on the egde of your seat until you finish. I'm a quick reader, but even I'm surprised I finished this in only an hour and a half!
031603438X|5.0|I highly recommend the book. I basically could not put it down and read it non-stop - other than sleeping and eating - until I finished it. Richards reminds me a fellow I used to work with many years ago who recently passed away, so it was nice to read it for that reason as well.    He was pretty honest about his bad temper, and there are other things there if read between the lines. He spares no one, including himself.    I play bass guitar (dabble maybe?) so I found the guitar technique and tuning talk very interesting as well. The ego growth that occurs in groups like that - mainly with Mick Jagger - is a common tale. The great news is that they survived it, but it killed groups like Pink Floyd when Roger Waters decided that he was the group.    There are certain people I'd like to have met who are no longer with us, and at I'd add Keith Richards to that list, but the still living list. I'll never meet him with the circles he travels in and the much smaller circle that I travel in, but it's a nice thought.
B002GOAH1A|4.0|I liked this video very much . Found it very entertaining and funny, liked Will Smith playing this part. I have now forwarded this video to my son stationed in Afghanistan. Hopefully he can find time to enjoy it also.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It keeps me intrigued and on the edge of my seat / bed / toes / etc., the entire time.  I love this stuff!
B001PO53IO|5.0|My kids love it.  Great image fidelity. I don't really care about DVD special features and so cannot comment on that.
B003WTE886|4.0|I love Taylor Swift and think this album is fantastic. The only downside (as a country fan) is that with each new album comes a little more pop, a little less country.  Not incredibly surprising seeing as most \\"country\\" is actually pop now, and a great album nonetheless.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is amazingly good. I loved it! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. It brings real life situations back home and touches your heart.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This bluray set is a really great deal. You get all of the films in high quality bluray.<br /><br />Regarding the movies themselves, I'd seen clips here and there of Rocky growing up, but I've never seen all of them in their entirety. These films were excellent. The characters were so rich and textured. Their interactions were so real, so complex and dynamic while grounded and sincere. Adrian is adorable in the first movie. The plots were pretty simple and straight forward, but so well executed.<br /><br />I can see why the Rocky films are definitely an American classic and must have!
B0042LVS54|1.0|In the last several years before this long awaited 'creative' effort, JK (like many other artists) has spent (& lost) lots of his energy fighting his previous record label (Sony) for more artistic control.    Now that he is freed from the evil tyrants (that made him a star) & been fully granted all the control he'd seek, it is quite aggravating, brutal even, to witness the lack of creativity presented here. Sadly for any music lover & even sadder for any true fan, five years in the waiting, what you get here is a mismatched, uninspired, time-filling, disconnected mixture of what could have barely graced b-sides of his past-life singles.    Be-side (pun intended) 'White Knuckle Ride', an uplifting & infectiously effective 'disco-electro' classic JK track (that I suspect, as it is so far off the rest of the album, was destined for a previously unreleased effort), there isn't anything quite aurally spectacular anymore about Jamiroquai's music. The writing is rather futile (compared to his usually intricate lyrics), the arrangements are repetitive & uninspired, the melodies are, for the most part, weak & fast forgotten. Even the self-loathing cover of the record suggest he's over the hill or well on his way there.    When JK was in his prime, the Buffalo Man was often used to distance his pretty looks from his art. And since the art was so incredibly good, one couldn't care less that no pics were found inside the booklets. One would focus on the groovy music & luscious, deliriously vintage arrangements instead. If there was a time I wished the B-Man was dusted off & put back to use on a cover, it has to be on this one. JK looks almost ridiculous. Even his facial expression seems to suggest: 'Don't I look silly?'    Don't get me wrong: I simply adore & respect this artist, i really do. Jamiroquai (Jay Kay) is a master at what he does. A skilled producer, a (usually very) inspired & inspiring writer surrounded by great, almost surreal musicians / vocalists. But let's be frank, if Jamiroquai was still under Sony's management, this record would have NEVER been released.    Stupendously, tyrannous record companies will often protect artists from attempting to release any crap they make, especially when they're so full of themselves to think ANY of their offering is good enough to go platinum. This was, several years ago, why JK got out of Sony, yet this is exactly one of those moments when a higher power should have stopped this mess from happening.    I am now 15$ shorter & terribly sad to admit that this album has only one undeniable quality: It makes ALL its predecessors scream genius, virtuosity & talent. This ain't no Dynamite, this ain't no Cowboy, no Synkronized... Nope.    Very rare are the artists that have actually been able to produce succesful, quality records after the epitaphic 'greatest hits' collection of their past successes. I am afraid there will never be a 'High Times' part 2.    'Pressure, it gets ya'. Nicely put JK, nicely put.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This movie is not what you think it will be.  It is a great movie about kids and their over-active imaginations that run wild.  While the movie does progress into kids doing things that most may just fantasize about, this movie is full of action and has a great ending.  There is violence in the movie, so it is not suitable for kids under 15, and even then they should be supervised.  I highly recommend this movie, and think most people will enjoy it!

B004D7GU3M|4.0|I been listening to this album since I received an \\"advance\\" copy. It's a classic from beginning to end, but what is up with the CENSORED artwork? The vinyl sleeve has a \\"parental control\\" label on it so why censor the artwork with the two monsters???? I think this form of censorship is a tragedy. But what's worse? The pain or the hang over? I wanna take the people who made this censored artwork to that ghetto university!!!!
B00333NCTM|5.0|I'd heard about Ozzy's behaviour and life before, I doubt there's someone born in the 70's-80's who hasn't. I had seen The Osbournes TV show occasionally, but I wasn't really an Ozzy or Black Sabbath fan before I started reading the book. One day a colleague of mine was commenting on the book, about how good it was and I decided to give it a try.  I was totally hooked from page one... The book is extremely funny and very entertaining. Even though lots of things in it are pretty serious, and must have been terrible to get by, really, Ozzy tells it in a way that's very entertaining and makes you laugh most of the time. It's amazing he could overcome all that, and still be alive. If I was Sharon, I probably wouldn't be able to take it.  The book surprised me, because I had this idea of him, and I realizied he couldn't be further away from the 'the Prince of Darkness' title. I really enjoyed reading it and now I'm a fan!  It's one of the best autobiographies I've read so far! And I've read quite a share of them. And a must for any one who enjoys rock n roll.
B0036TGSJ4|2.0|Unlike all the other teen comedies my wife likes, I was actually looking forward to [[ASIN:B0036TGSIK Easy A]]. I'd heard good things about Emma Stone, and Amanda Byrnes has been in some funny modernized adaptations of classic tories. [[ASIN:B0036TGSIK Easy A]] was billeted as an update of [[ASIN:1936594277 The Scarlet Letter]]. Unfortunately, it fails to live up to its promise.     First, I'm not sure how this movie receives praise for its acting. I'm usually pretty tolerant of bad acting, as long as I can suspend my disbelief for an hour or two. However, I was never sold by the acting in [[ASIN:B0036TGSIK Easy A]]. Too often it feels like the actors are reading from a script. Even Byrnes seems unsure how to play a Christian fundamentalist - it just isn't the right role for her.    More importantly, the script just doesn't really work. It becomes too predictable too early and Olive's decisions seem too ridiculous to sympathize with. There are some plot devices that seem simply thrown in for one or two lame jokes, such as the African-American adopted brother - it's clear he has no other role except to make a joke about awkward it is for white parents to adopt an African kid. Occasionally, the film delivers some really witty lines, but these are few and often delivered awkwardly. For example, a mother belittles her son's grade on a spelling test by saying that everybody uses spell-checker these days - and I burst out laughing - but then she laughs and says she's just kidding, which dilutes the power of the joke. There were several points like this where the context of the movie didn't really allow one to appreciate those good moments.    Overall, none of these problems alone would ruin [[ASIN:B0036TGSIK Easy A]], but combined they make for a lousy movie. Too bad.
B0045ODPKY|5.0|Angelina Jolie has definitely reached star status. She makes films that have a certain cerebral quality that the critics enjoy but she remains true to her fans, those that bought repeat tickets to see TOMB RAIDER, by making action films as well. And if nothing else SALT is a non stop action thrill ride that those fans will love but with enough story to satisfy the critics.<br /><br />Jolie stars as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who as the film starts has been captured by the North Koreans and then traded due to the insistence of her boyfriend, an arachnologist (he studies spiders) she was involved with. The two marry and Evelyn continues working for the CIA without his apparent knowledge.<br /><br />Move forward two years and Evelyn is about to go home for the night. But she and her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) are stopped before going to interrogate a man who has just turned himself in saying he was a Russian spy and knows of a big event about to take place. As she interrogates the man he tells her about a spy movement begun during the cold war when deep undercover spies were placed throughout the U.S. to be activated years later. That time is now. Viewing his statement as nothing more than talk, she begins to leave until he tells her the name of the spy who will assassinate the Russian president: Evelyn Salt.<br /><br />The team goes on high alert and Evelyn is place in a holding cell till they can sort through it all. The Russian is being escorted to a cell of his own but kills his guards and escapes. Fearful of what might happen to her husband, Evelyn breaks out on her own after a creative escape. She has to find him and protect him.<br /><br />While Ted continues to defend Salt, Agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) (a sort of internal affairs agent) leads the chase to bring Salt back into custody and prevent what appears to be a legitimate threat to the Russian president. Set to deliver the eulogy for the recently deceased Vice President, the assassination could result in a world war.<br /><br />Salt is tracked to her apartment where she finds the remains of an abduction of her husband, her worst fears come to pass. She barely makes it out before the CIA comes crashing in but once she hits the streets they follow. A sequence involving Salt jumping from the top of one semi-truck to another makes for one of the best chase scenes filmed in some time.<br /><br />Salt makes her escape, changes her look and begins preparing...to assassinate the Russian president! This is where the film brings on a fantastic twist. Where we would normally think that since this is Jolie she has to be innocent, we're suddenly wondering if she really could be the spy they think she is, an assassin. And when she causes panic and blows up the floor of the church where the Vice President's funeral is taking place, bringing the Russian president down a floor and into her gun sights, who knows if she is innocent of guilty?<br /><br />But long viewing film fans will figure out pieces of the puzzle before the last minutes of the film. As Salt continues on her path, reuniting with the Russian agent we saw her interrogate, more deep cover spies are revealed. It seems there was more to this story. Perhaps hundreds of these spies were placed long ago and now the plan is to turn them lose in an attempt to destroy the United States. Will Salt be the one to bring this plan to its ultimate goal or is she really trying to stop it before it begins?<br /><br />You'll have to watch to find out in a movie that has the feel of a roller coaster ride, swinging you this way and that until you roll into the station. The action is non stop, enhanced by both fantastic stunt work and a fast paced musical score that adds to the mix.<br /><br />Jolie does a great job here and should win over new fans. She offers both a tender side to the character as she worries about her husband and a killer side that plots out the destruction of those set in her sights. Best of all she switches those emotions without words but with acting, a tough job to accomplish. Best of all she takes a predominately male type role and offers an incredibly strong female combatant to the spy genre.<br /><br />The ending of the film offers a surprise of its own. What appears to be the final twist in the tale is given another little nudge that means perhaps a SALT 2 is in the making. At least the possibility is there.Best of all she takes a predominately male type role and offers an incredibly strong female combatant to the spy genre.

0789208547|5.0|Beautiful collection! Bought this gift for husband who's nostalgic and longs for simpler days.  He loves it but won't put it out on the coffee table for us all to enjoy--stores it safely away from grandchildren.  So, I haven't looked at it much.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|When we last saw the character of Alice (Milla Jovovich) in the third RESIDENT EVIL movie, she was about to take on a zombie horde again as her friends left for a new world, a new chance somewhere in Alaska. A signal was being broadcast from \\"Arcadia\\" promising hope and safety. Alice was giving them the chance to make it there.<br /><br />The latest edition, RESIDENT EVIL:AFTERLIFE, opens with an army of Alice clones taking on the Umbrella Corporation in their Tokyo facility. Filled with blood and mayhem, the Alices wipe out the initial army sent to stop her, working their way to the head man. A confrontation in a plane as he destroys Tokyo with a massive bomb leads to their crashing but with Alice, of course, walking away.<br /><br />Six months later Alice is flying to Arcadia in search of her friends. She arrives to find a graveyard of airplanes and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) disheveled, crazy and wearing a controlling device on her chest. Subdued, Alice tries to find out what happened but Claire is suffering a loss of memory. Together they fly to Hollywood where they find a group of survivors trapped in a prison and surrounded by zombies.<br /><br />Landing the plane on the roof, Alice and Claire are introduced to these survivors who have been hearing the radio broadcast for Arcadia, except that it's not a town at all. Using binoculars they found that Arcadia was a ship and it's now sitting in the harbor. The only problem is they have to find there way there and Alice's airplane only holds two people.<br /><br />Deep in the cellar of the prison is a special prisoner still locked away. This turns out to be Chris Redfield (in an ironic twist of casting played by Wentworth Miller, start of PRISONBREAK). Fortunately for these survivors, Chris knows a way out. Unfortunately at the same time the zombies have found a way to tunnel in to the prison and begin attacking. Topside a massive zombie with a giant hammer is attacking as well, breaking down the main entrance.<br /><br />Much of this is taken directly from the game the film is based on. The suspense isn't developed in wondering how they'll get out but if they'll get out. You also know from the start that not everyone will survive. Characters in these films tend to become fodder for the zombies to assist others in surviving. It's just a question of who will survive and who will become a very unhappy meal.<br /><br />The action is high level mingled with plot revelations and a storyline that moves the plot forward. It's not a plot on par with the most involved spy thriller, but it does hold your interest and moves the film along. The problem is these films have a tendency to move forward only to set up the next one. Sony has realized they have a decent franchise here and it's more about that than making a stand alone film.<br /><br />This movie was made featuring the newest technological gimmick to lure people into theaters again, 3-D, and while it doesn't affect the story you can still tell the scenes made to feature the effects. Guns are pointed at you, ninja stars thrown your way and blood splatters towards the camera. For me the chance to see this in 3-D it wouldn't warrant the extra expense of the ticket.<br /><br />Granted this is not a set piece for Oscar winning material but the actors here do a great job of making you believe they are the people they are portraying. Movies in this genre have been made featuring some terrible acting (watch nearly any SyFy mega creature film and you'll know what I mean), but the RESIDENT EVIL films have fortunately been blessed with decent actors who make their parts come alive. Well, except for those playing zombies.<br /><br />Perhaps my only disappointment in this latest film was the number of zombies used. We get great crowd shots of them but little one on one confrontation. And when we do they move so fast we don't see much of them. Seeing as how this film was 3-D one would think fans would love to see the gory make up effects coming out of the screen. With the exception of a nasty rooftop encounter for Alice and one zombie shown bursting through the earth after tunneling, we don't get that.<br /><br />Bottom line is the movie is fun. It does offer another tale in the series and does it well. It holds your interest from beginning to end and moves the franchise along, ending with (of course) a set up for another sequel.<br /><br />I'm waiting for the day when I look to see what's playing at the local multiplex or available at the video store or redbox only to discover that everything is a sequel or remake. The way things are going, that day seems to be getting closer.r for Alice and one zombie shown bursting through the earth after tunneling, we don't get that.    Bottom line is the movie is fun.

0756405890|2.0|I've just finished reading The Name of the Wind. Where to start, where to start? On the positive side, the author has a good vocabulary, an excellent ear and sense of timing in his dialogue and a very solid style that allows for a lot of free indirect speech which suits this first person narrative. THAT said, first person is ... dangerous unless great care is taken to create a character who will not end up grating on nerves as being too narcissistic or too self effacing. The only thing worse than false modesty in a first person character is false pride.<br /><br />This character seems ... disingenuous to the point of absurdity ... when he's not being arrogant to the point of nausea. He was hot or cold;  nothing temperate with which I could identify. And neither hot nor cold enough to make me love him or hate him. Since I was never worried about him I also did not come to the moment when I was rooting for him so the story could continue. It was all very 'meh'.<br /><br />I picked up this book because of all the hype surrounding it as a masterful example of world building, which is one of my particular interests in this genre. Sorry, but I found the world dull as dishwater and the basic story so full of cliche and trope that it ended up being a primer on something quite different from world building.<br /><br />The author has some interesting and commendable philosophies - there were some gems buried in the prose - but the mouthpiece he chose is either a sad case of wish fulfillment and he needs to put his Gary Stu disguise away or it is simply a bad case of character creation. It seems to me that even Jesus Christ could come off as a self-important bag of wind if he tried to tell his own story. Creating epic heroes requires at least a level of distance and objectivity which first person, by its nature, cannot provide. Which is why very few really good authors use it and why it is the mainstay of fan fiction.<br /><br />Either way - not the worst book I ever read, but it won't end up on my shelf of a thousand or so that I keep thinking I will reread or use as a reference. I won't be buying the second book, but I will likely await its inevitable arrival in free PDF format.

B000EUDAWG|5.0|A remote-controlled life-size tarantula!  Truly a delightful gift....and one probably not expected by the recipient!  What fun!    Ironic tales from \\"Alfred Hitchcok Presents\\" run through my mind at seeing this, er, toy(?)  I'm sure it has many, many uses!  But one use I would NOT suggest is to give this to any male-chauvinist you know, who has been pressured into inviting his fiancee to his bachelor party.  For he will be instructed NOT to have a girl jump out of the bachelor-party cake.   He is despondent and unhappy....  ...then he spies this remote-control spider....(!)  (Revenge may   be sweet.....but it comes at a price, when your bride-to-be has a   heart attack, and must be rushed to the hospital!    Then again, it can also be used, if you wish to play a trick on someone you distinctly dislike -- but must be nice to....say your boss.  When you are alone with your boss's children, let them play with your remote-controlled toy tarantula.  Like the children who grew up watching \\"Born Free\\", they will soon learn to love the little   black and yellow, cuddly thing with eight arms.  Tell them NOT to tell their parents about your -- and now their -- little friend.  Then, when your rich boss decides to take his children on a vacation to a country with a sunny, tropical climate...!  (Then again, animals can \\"smell fear\\" a mile off -- but if the boss's children are NOT afraid of any real-life tarantula they might meet on this vacation....maybe you have saved their lives, and also, perhaps, (oops!) that of your boss as well, because you have taught them not to be afraid of \\"Mr. or Ms. Furry With the Eight Legs\\".    The uses of this particular toy may indeed be endless.  And, although it is not now included, perhaps the \\"Uncle Milton\\" toymakers could get a franchise licence from the estate of Milton Berle, and then include a DVD of \\"Uncle Miltie's Best Moments\\", with every toy, (not just this one), that they sell.  This way, tots can learn about TV history AND perhaps become more interested in \\"Uncle Milton's\\" other  products as well!  Hmmm....maybe a dress or two could be designed for   the \\"Uncle Milton\\" range of remote controlled insects!  What a great way to form a bond between kids, and, especially, their great-grandfathers and great-grandmothrs, right now!

B002ZG98UK|1.0|I have not been this disappointed with a purchase in my life. After watching The Guardians of..in 3D and watching this movie, I almost threw it in the oven. I was so excited to buy this movie in 3D spending over $30 for it. Infact, do not spend ur money for the 3D, just buy a regular DVD disc and you will just be fine or rent it at some dollar rental. I could watch this movie without the glasses and it was clear as bottled water - no 3D effects. I have a 73 Inch DLP TV, 3D ready, setup with a computer using a 3D software play with Diamond Radeon 6XXX series video card - the entire shebang. I have confortably watched other 3D movies with great satisfaction. I will be returning this to the store - bought it from Bestbuy - they can keep my money if they want!    01-02-2011 - It would not be fair for me to leave this review as is. The problem had been with my video card software. I had to restore my computer to the the last date the 3D worked and the moview worked great. So therefore, this movies' 3D effects are just as good - good. I must say though that outside of the movies with Avatar, the best 3D I have had in Bluray so far has been The Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole 3D. I am updating the star ratings of this movie (Resident Evil) to 4! Sorry if I earlier on spoke ill of any product of seller relating to this review.

I recently bought a pair of BOSE earphones and I was able to listen to the excellent recording.  I have listened to the CD over and over and do not get tired of it.  Call me oldfashioned but my favorite on this CD is TRES PALABRAS, that made the purchase worth its value.
B0042816YK|1.0|Eat, Pray, Love.  Three of my favorite things.  I'm a rabbi.  That should make me a perfect person to love this movie.  I pray a lot, three times a day.  I meditate and do yoga.  Judaism is well known as a religion that celebrates eating well, and we don't have any of those annoying vows of celibacy (I have five kids).    Not only that, the movie takes place in New York, Italy, India, and Bali - all places I have been to and that I like.    So I was positively predisposed to this film.  I went into it with high expectations.  Which made my disappointment all the greater.  I found the movie very tedious.    I was concerned that maybe it's because I'm a guy, and as my 14-year-old daughter pointed out, this is a real \\"chick flick.\\"  I was relieved to discover that my wife - who likes Jane Austen movies - also thought Eat, Pray, Love was tedious.  It wasn't just my testosterone speaking!    The pluses: Julia Robert is still easy on the eyes, despite her advancing years (look, none of us is getting younger).  No problem believing that the young hunks would still think she's hot.  If you like food, you'll like the \\"food porn\\" in Italy.  But the film has a lot of weaknesses:    * The basic premise is not plausible.  The protagonist has a life most women I know would die for.  A great writing job, a hot husband, incredible friends, a beautiful house.  Where does all the angst come from?  You want to travel and your husband doesn't?  Get over it.  Go write your article about Aruba and come home to a nice house.    * The pacing is VERY slow.  Excruciatingly slow at times.  This film is not \\"arty\\" enough, not \\"eye candy\\" enough to get away with moving so slow.    * Everywhere she goes it seems she runs into people spouting clichés and platitudes that she takes for profound wisdom.  \\"The sweetness of doing nothing (it sounds better in Italian).\\" The paradox of how hard you have to work at relaxing and meditating.  That sometimes you find balance by giving up your balance to love.  Etc.  All said by very different gurus: Italians in a barbershop, a rough Texan who has absorbed all the wisdom of the ashram, a toothless old medicine man in Bali.    * Instead of spouting platitudes a real friend would listen.  She never reveals why she is so filled with angst about her life and harsh feelings toward her husband and then her boyfriend.    All in all, a poor execution of a good premise.  The script is so weak that even a strong cast couldn't save the film.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and new it was one I was going to have to have. The cast is awesome and it has the true theme of a Sylvester Stallone movie. Lots of action. I really enjoy it and I love being able to order it from Amazon. They always have good prices and fast shipping!!
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I'm a college sophomore, and to be honest I only watched this movie to see more of Emma Stone.  To my surprise, she was not only hot as expected, but she gave an incredible performance as a high school girl.  The whole movie reminded me of Mean Girls, but that is also a great movie.      Overall, a fun and surprising trip back to high school.  Emma Stone is one of the best young actresses out there now.
0812548094|4.0|Stone of Tears picks up right where Wizard's First Rule left off. With hardly a moment to catch your breath from the conclusion of the first book, the consequences of what was done arrive in an action-packed sequence. After an initial burst of action, though, things settle in for a bit, and the long process of setting up the pieces for the story to come begins. And make no mistake: at nearly one thousand pages, this is a long book. On the one hand, this length helps give the book its epic feel, along with the mythical creatures, heroes' journeys, and high-stakes conflicts, but at times it feels like the writing could be sharper, tighter, and less repetitive (how many times does he use the phrase \\"sidelong glance\\"?). Repetition does seem to be Terry Goodkind's favorite way of ramming a point home, and he walks the fine line between repetition and padding frequently. Another problem here is poor copyediting. I don't knock Goodkind for this, but his copyeditor let a ton of misspellings through, which can be a real distraction. Whether they're word errors like \\"in\\" where it should be \\"it\\" or straight-up misspellings, \\"brough\\" instead of \\"brought,\\" I've never encountered more misspellings in a book more often than in Goodkind's novels. My last criticism is of the overuse of rape as plot point. This is Goodkind's go-to problem for Kahlan and other female characters. It was used well at times, but after a while it lost a bit of its narrative power due to overuse.<br /><br />Still, one does not have to be blind to a book's faults to appreciate its virtues. The action is exciting, the characters have heart and soul, the adventure is truly epic. It's been many years since I read books this long this fast. It's very difficult to stop at the end of each chapter. Throughout Stone of Tears, I'd keep finding myself saying, \\"maybe I'll read just one more chapter . . .\\"<br /><br />In the end, that's the most important thing, particularly for a Fantasy novel. This world, and these characters, draw me in like few others ever have. I care about what happens to Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, and the others. They can be maddeningly stubborn and naive, but their imperfections help to make them more real and interesting. When it comes to magic, adventure, swords, and sorcery, The Sword of Truth series delivers for the second time with Stone of Tears.

0307474712|3.0|'One Day' is written brilliantly- that's about all I can say for it. David Nicholls is great, and honestly the clever, funny way that the story is told is about the only thing keeping me from totally trashing this book. The whole plot comes across as very convenient. And *SPOILERS SPOILERS*, after the two of them finally get together and the book reveals flashbacks of their first day together, you're left wondering...okay, WHY didn't they just get together from the beginning? Especially when their first day together is clearly some sort of whirlwind romance thing. It was believable with just the first chapter- them waking up in bed together, having some awkward conversation, and then him leaving- but are we supposed to believe that, after that day that they had and how much they both CLEARLY like each other, that they wouldn't get together immediately? In the real world, these two people would've become an item very quickly, but because the author wanted the plot the way he wanted it, he ignored that. It's Not When Harry Met Sally. That progression is believable- they weren't fiercely in love after their first meeting. This one is not.     Again, Nicholls' extremely clever writing is what makes me unable to give this book below 3 stars.
B002ZG99NG|3.0|I gave this movie the benefit of the doubt to see how it will resemblance with the movie Heat.  After watching it, Heat is definitely better.  In consolation, it wasn't a bad movie.  I thought Ben Affleck did a great job on his directorial debut.  Had Heat never existed, I would've given this a four star.  Why not a five star you may ask?  Because some of the actors are not that well known or I should say the least, suitable for the role (again, in comparison with Heat).    Overall, the movie is okay with good action fighting sequence.  Would I buy this bluray again had I known or seen this movie in the theatres first?  Maybe.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These headphones perform . They sound crystal clear and the 7.1 surround effect is accurate to a pinpoint. I've used the X31's at my brother in law's place but I think the X41's flat out blow them out of the water. The first game I tried out with them was \\"Dead Space\\" and believe me, the sound scape of this game is even more layered than you might believe. I was hearing details that you just can't pick up on a full home surround setup. Hard to believe that a game I've finished more than half a dozen times became even more terrifying due to these headphones. I played several other games and they all sounded stunning. Halo: Reach, Red Dead Redemption, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Dead Rising 2 basically became different games now. Halo: Reach especially blew me away. I had to keep looking at my wife, thinking that I was disturbing her with all the noise.<br /><br />The setup for this baby is very, very simple and straightforward. I was up and running within two minutes and I didn't even look at the instructions, it was that easy. The headset itself runs on 2x AAA batteries. The transmitter doesn't run on AC and connects to the Xbox via USB, which is nice. A packaged optical goes from the Xbox to the RF transmitter and there's an optical connection going out if you want to run that to a receiver without losing your home theater setup in the process. A cable comes packaged that connects the headset to your controller, that way you can chat. It'd be nice if it was strictly wireless but Microsoft doesn't give up their secrets so readily.<br /><br />I am more than impressed with these headphones and I'd recommend a pair to anyone who appreciates surround sound in their gaming, which frankly, I can't do without. A big thumbs up to Turtle Beach for releasing a stellar product.
1594488843|5.0|In the industrial economy, carrots & sticks always seemed to work best to motivate people--if they do well, give them a reward (a raise, an extra day off) and if they don't, well, perhaps it's time for the pink slip. But what happens when that doesn't work anymore? How do you motivate people in the information age?<br /><br />Daniel Pink narrows it down to three factors: Autonomy, mastery and purpose. When people are given some level of control over what they do, the opportunity to become \\"masters\\" in it and the work is connected to a larger purpose (beyond making some person rich), Pink's research has shown that employee satisfaction increases dramatically and the work they do gets better. We've been using these general ideas in our departmental reviews for about a year and it's been extraordinarily helpful.<br /><br />And as a bonus, the book also helped potty train our daughter.

B0042JTDXK|3.0|I have been a fan of Josh Groban from the moment he stepped on the scene.  His voice is hypnotic and unmatched in quality.  His past albums have reflected his exceptional vocal performance and have been lyrically nothing short of amazing.  With beautiful songs under his belt like, \\"You Raise Me Up,\\" \\"When You Say You Love Me,\\" \\"You Are Loved,\\" and \\"So She Dances,\\" and tearing it up on the soundtrack of Chess - I couldn't wait to hear more for someone so talented.<br /><br />Needless to say Illuminations was at the top of my Christmas list this year.  When I played this album \\"The Wandering Kind\\" was a very welcome surprise.  The Celtic charm of this particular piece was unexpected and warmed my heart.  Again, I was anticipating what I would hope to be a great CD.<br /><br />The songs that follow The Wandering Kind are neither bad nor good.  They are melodic and soulful, however they are tired and repetitive.  The songs are like what most high school choir teachers subject their students to performing.  Groban performs them with the charm and charisma with which he approached his previous recordings, yet somehow they fall short.  These songs are predictable in their melody and the repetitive nature of each of them - to be quite frank - irritated me.  I expected better.<br /><br />The most disappointing part of this album is by far the lyrics.  In some tracks it sounds, again, like a high schooler trying to write their own songs or poetry.  \\"Galileo (Someone Like You)\\" has some of the more unfortunate lyrics:<br /><br />\\"Galileo fell in love as a Galilean boy<br />And he wondered what in heaven who invented such a joy\\"<br /><br />That segment alone is nearly imperceivable.  As I went through each song and listened again and again, I could only come to these same conclusions.<br /><br />It pains me to write an unflattering review of someone I so admire and respect, however, Mr. Groban, I feel as though you missed the mark a tad on this one.  Better luck next time.
B00461MY30|5.0|I  would like to know before I buy this, if these were remastered digitally or analog. Everything seems vague about the source and sadly that often means a company is hiding the fact they used digital masters, which can sound fine, but defeats the whole purpose of why I would buy this. It would be greatly appreciated if anyone can answer this question.

B00008O89K|4.0|Beyond the choice between this (Milan) edition and the out-of-print Varese edition (see \\"tearsinraine\\"'s featured review), there is now a new third option that you should strongly consider. Released in late 2010, it is a 2-disc COMPLETE score, with Nic Raine conducting the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus. Here are three reasons why this new version is a must-have:    1. It is the complete score, 100 minutes of music, so there is significantly more material than the previous recordings (33 minutes more than Varese, and 51 more than this Milan edition). It also features a few alternate versions of tracks and one track from Conan the Destroyer.    2. It is performed by a larger orchestra (96-piece orchestra and a 100-voice chorus) and more instruments, as Basil Poledouris originally wanted it done.    3. Prior reviewers have noted that the Milan and Varese editions sound dated due to the early 1980s recording quality, but this brand new digital recording sounds AMAZING!    To be clear, this new recording is not going to sound exactly like what you heard in the movie. I think this version sounds BETTER!  If you really want the exact movie sound, get either the Milan or Varese editions, but get this new version too, or you're going to miss out on great sound and more music.    Currently, the new recording is only available on Amazon through third-party Screen Archives Entertainment. I almost let that deter me, but I'm glad I didn't. Also, don't be deterred by the somewhat low-quality artwork Amazon shows from the cd's back cover. The sound inside is absolutely first-rate.

0783116934|5.0|That 95 people have sent in reviews of an obscure, 15 year old, made for TV movie movie should tell you something right away. This is an exceptional work. I have owned mine for 13 of these years and have viewed it as many as 20 times. It always gives me great pleasure to show it to people who have never heard of it. Each time I watch it I find something new to focus on.<br /><br />I always want to compare this film to Fritz Lang's M. Yes, each is about a serial child murderer. Neither panders to sensational or lurid murder footage. Rather, each is a drama about the nature of killers and the societies in which their apprehension is attempted. Unlike M, with its criminal underground doing what the police failed to accomplish, the USSR of this film won't catch him because they can't admit that he exists. Only with the thaw of perestroika is the long suffering chief investigator allowed to work without serial impediments. This much more a movie about the USSR than a single killer.<br /><br />As another reviewer has noted, there is a consistent, but unobtrusive thread of black humor in this movie. Without it the film would have been ponderous. Sutherland plays a very cynical aparatactic with an impish sense of humor and Rey slowly develops sardonic wit. Their interactions are electric and droll at the same time.<br /><br />We have grown accustomed by now to TV producing great or near great movies. This was among the first and has languished in obscurity. I believe that the enthusiasm number of reviews should testify to the film's greatness and watchability.

B0035WRY7C|5.0|I have never read an Alex Rider book before, but I thought I would give it a try. I started with Stormbreaker the first book in the series. Alex is a 14 year old school boy, who is told his uncle dies suddenly in a car accident. Alex doesn't believe his uncle accidentally died in a car accident, so he starts his own investigation and discovers the hidden life his uncle had.  Alex discovers his uncle is a British spy for M16 and not the Banker that his uncle said he was. As Alex is investigating his uncles death , Alex is then recruited by M16 to finish out his uncle's unfinished mission.  Alex, a normal 14 year old going to school one day, and saving the world the next!         Stormbreaker was a great book to read because of all of the non-stop action, never a dull moment. From beginning to end Stormbreaker was a real page turner and impossible to put down. Alex, a school boy one day and the next he's surviving  SAS Spy training camp, a dive through freezing underground dark waters , parachuting out of a plane over London, shooting the enemy, fighting  a poisonous jellyfish and much, much more.  Alex Rider seemed to always be cheating death even though the odds were against him. I was glad I took the time to read a book about Alex Rider and his adventures. I feel if anyone is looking for a high action packed book, that keeps your attention throughout, Stormbreaker is the book for you. I would highly recommend this book!  In my opinion, you will enjoy this book and you will also not want to put it down!    Review provided by Bryce C.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Tarsem Singh's \\"The Fall\\" is in my mind very much a masterpiece.  It is genius in a way, though, that doesn't really call itself into comparison with other movies - it creates its own form of cinematic experience.  On the surface you might say it has elements of Fellini (the surrealism), David Lean (the vast cinematic sweep) and even \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (its fantasy and childlike perspective) but Tarsem has definitely created his own beautiful and strange world with this epic, global fantasy.  There are so many elements that are interwoven throughout the movie (images and themes and personalities) that it really has to be seen a number of times to begin to digest what's going on.  It has a really strong poetic sensibility that expresses itself in stunning visuals and in the storyline.  It's interesting that Tarsem sees the film through a child's imagination and, at the same time, it takes place in the silent film era, at the very beginning of film history.  Its almost like Tarsem's attempting to see filmmaking as something wholly new to be discovered for the first time, as it was originally, without all the formulas that directors have learned and practised for the last century.  \\"The Fall\\" is really something unique and fresh and is definitely high risk filmmaking.  If Tarsem has the freedom to bring even half of his personal vision to his next project, \\"Immortals\\", it should also be quite a memorable film. Its very important to have creative directors who are willing to take a chance and do something different - to be visionary.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I was just amazed at how well done this set is.  I would highly recommend this to those who love the show, like me or for those who have not gotten one of the most breathtaking TV series to hit Blu-ray.  For those who have already bought the seasons separately, I don't think this is worth the price of readmission unless you are a die-hard fan.  Nothing here is new in terms of content as each season's set contain the same discs and features as those which have already been released.  However, there is a hidden extra disc that has a lot of new extras that you may find interesting - though still not worth buying this entire set for.    If you still do not have any of the previous seasons, or have a few missing seasons - I would highly recommend that you check this out.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|A great ensemble cast. Can't pick a favorite character, they're all so great.  Aside from being wickedly funny, Modern Family has a lot of heart. Sweet, but not treacly. Clever writing, fun sight gags, all in all one of the best comedies since Arrested Development.

1594484775|3.0|This melancholic novel is set mostly in an out-of-the-way northern England, seaside town and is driven by a cultish regard for a music album JULIET produced in the 80s by the little-known, American musician Tucker Crowe, who has quite literally disappeared for all these years. The book opens with Duncan, by profession, a teacher in England, and his longtime live-in girlfriend Annie, a museum curator, visiting places (shrines in his eyes) frequented in the US by Crowe, including his birthplace and, most bizarrely, a filthy restroom in a bar in Minneapolis where Crowe apparently made an abrupt decision to quit the music business. Duncan, in his preferred life, operates a web site devoted to all aspects of Crowe's life: his every utterance, the hidden meanings in his songs, his current appearance and location, etc.<br /><br />But this neatly demarcated area of expertise is unexpectedly undermined with the release of never heard raw cuts of Juliet, dubbed, Juliet, Naked. Duncan, rushing to control the spin on this latest revelation, declares the tracks to be vastly superior to the refined, final product, much to Annie's dismay. She increasingly sees Duncan's fixation on Crowe as symptomatic of her predicable, uneventful life. She posts a well-received, contrary view of the new release on the Crowe website, which, unbelievably so, is privately answered by Crowe.<br /><br />Their email exchanges are at first guarded (Why has Tucker surfaced is a question), but a tentative relationship starts to form somewhat based on their mutual recognition that large chunks of their lives have been mostly a waste. In the case of Tucker, his many failed relationships have produced five children, none of whom he really knows except for six-year-old Jackson who lives with him. He is basically broke, living off of his estranged wife Cat, with few prospects. Coincidentally, the miscarriage of one of his daughters brings him to London. Annie is upset when Tucker fails to meet at their agreed-to spot, until she learns that a medical incident has landed him in a London hospital. Eventually, despite a certain amount of awkwardness and hesitancies, mostly on the part of Annie, Tucker and Jackson secretly leave the hospital with Annie and return to her home on the coast, Duncan having left over their tiff concerning Juliet, Naked.<br /><br />Despite the overall story line of the book being rather implausible, the regrets of wasting lives on narrow obsessions, in lieu of experiencing full lives, are palpable. Her basically asexual life with Duncan is especially distressing to Annie, although she hardly aspires to being a slut. Despite the fact that the author is generally sympathetic towards all of the characters, many of them are rather stunted. Duncan is unusually tone-deaf about life and the withdrawal and reclusiveness of Tucker never make much sense. The book is a quick read and is not without the occasional sharp insight; however, an annoying aspect of the book is the too-smart dialog of the very young Jackson. There are no story-book endings here, but Annie has had the courage to dig herself out of the quicksand with at least some promise of forging a more fulfilling life from this point.she learns that a medical incident has landed him in a London hospital.

B00110K62U|5.0|I have all cd/dvd/tapes etc made of 'Les Miserable' and they are all very enjoyable in their own way but, for me as a huge fan of 'Les Mis' I have to say that the 1995 10 year anniversary show from Earls Court was superbly done by all concerned from the back stage to Cameron Mackintosh....and the two lead parts inparticular (ValJean & Javert) Colm Wilkinson and Philip Quast made that show something very special backed up very admirably by all other cast members.  I was at that show and I was apsolutely taken aback with the power of the production....simply amazing.  Anyone considering buying this show edition which is definitely miles better than other versions, edited or otherwise, (Not demeaning those I have to say) I highly recommend this original version. Buy it and you will be like me watching it every opportune moment.   Finally can I add a footnote....Susan Boyle did a great job of 'I dream the dream' but once again in no way does her version compere to the rendition by Ruthie Henshall as Fantine....MAGICAL is the thing that comes to mind.    If you think you have seen Les Mis...you haven't until you watch this....sound well up for atmosphere,  good bottle of wine with some 'bites' snacks, wife or partner close by, 4 hours to spare and you will think you are heaven.  I rest my case and thank you for reading this review.  Thankyou  Showman.
B0041T52S6|3.0|I had exceptionally high expectations for this movie. [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]] and [[ASIN:B000RJO578 Hot Fuzz]] are two of my favorite comedies, and I was really hoping that Edgar Wright would knock it out of the park with this one. I was aware of the comics, and once I learned that it was a kind of celebration of video games, those expectations went even higher.<br /><br />Then I finally saw the movie, and I'm not sure what to think anymore.<br /><br />I guess I was expecting it to be more...video game-based. Maybe it was an unfair assumption, but I was surprised how very little the story or anything had to do with gaming, aside from the very loose, very indirect references that were pretty much interchangeable. But let me start over.<br /><br />SCOTT PILGRIM is about a young Canadian in his early twenties and this love triangle he randomly and shamelessly sparks. He's the bassist of a band that has yet to make it big, and is thusly relegated to playing small gigs and sharing a very small apartment with his gay best friend (I know he's gay because the film repeatedly goes out of its way to remind you, as if we wouldn't have figured it out otherwise). Despite the fact that Scott has a girl who is pretty much his counterpart, he begins cheating on her for another girl, Ramona Flowers, who he has no reason to like outside of her very loud hair.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Scott, Ramona's exes have formed a League of Evil Exes that will stop at nothing to ensure Ramona will never have another boyfriend. The rest of the movie shows Scott attempting to date two girls at once, all the while fighting these Evil Exes to the \\"death.\\"<br /><br />The story is not the star of this film. Without the seriously-amazing visuals, it would never be able to stand on its own. Scott, to me, is one of the most unlikeable protagonists I've ever come across. It seems his likability is directly proportional to how much you approve of his juggling two relationships at the same time. I didn't care for this, so there was really no reason for me to care whether or not Scott would even win these fights he got into. That, to me, was a disappointing bust.<br /><br />Fortunately, the characters were interesting enough to carry me through it. Scott Pilgrim's gay friend, Wallace (he's gay, by the way), pretty much steals the show. He's hilarious, well-acted, and was definitely more interesting than the rest of the cast. Ramona Flowers is fairly interesting, as well. Her character seems, against all odds, believable, as was the emotional development she goes through. Kim, the band's red-headed drummer, was also very funny throughout.<br /><br />But, in all honesty, this movie will probably be remembered for the style in which it was filmed, and I have a bone to pick with it in that regard. The video game references. They are laced throughout this movie, and it was one of the main reasons I was interested in watching it. But, in my opinion, they really served no purpose. Throughout the entire movie, two video games are played, and one doesn't even exist. A couple games are briefly mentioned, but it only amounts to name-dropping.<br /><br />Despite the fact that you'll hear the opening jingle to ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST at the start, several sound bites from SONIC and STREET FIGHTER, people burst into coins like in RIVER CITY RANSOM, and that the final battle takes place in the \\"Chaos Theater,\\" which fans of EARTHBOUND will recognize, there's nothing about the plot that constitutes all of these indirect references. If the movie had showed one of the characters actually playing FINAL FANTASY II, it would have made all the difference. Gamers living in a game world. But there's very little about them that makes me think, \\"Now there's a gamer. There's a guy who got the Biggoron Sword in OCARINA, and knows where all the secret Warp Pipes are in SUPER MARIO BROS. 3.\\"<br /><br />All of the references are just interchangeable. In fact, I would wager you could remove all of them and it would make very little difference. That's what was really disappointing to me, and the laughs will really, really depend on whether or not you're able to buy into it all.<br /><br />In the end, the movie was enjoyable, and probably more disappointing to me than it should have been, given the high bar I'd set for it. Fans of Edgar Wright will probably find something to like about this, as will fans of stylistic/cartoonish action films like [[ASIN:B000QGEB12 Kung Fu Hustle]]. The choreography was awesome, the action was satisfying, but as for the gaming element, I don't think the film could have missed the mark any more than it did.hat was really disappointing to me, and the laughs will really, really depend on whether or not you're able to buy into it all.

B0041KKYEW|3.0|At the center of most all of Darren Aronofsky's movies are characters driven by obsession and addiction. Black Swan is no different. Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a ballerina in the prestigious New York City ballet who has the opportunity to perform in the role of a lifetime, and will stop at nothing to perfect it. The only problem is that the she has both a life as well as a ballet routine built upon structure and discipline.  The dual sided role of Swan Queen also requires a simplicity and grace that she painfully (literally) struggles to find.<br /><br />  Nina is also forced to deal with a repressive and controlling mother (Barbara Hershey) who wants nothing more than her daughter to have the glamorous ballet career that she was forced to give up, as well as the star newcomer Lilly (Mila Kunis) whom she believes wants nothing more than to steal her coveted role as the Swan Queen.  As the performance draws closer, the paranoia and tension begin to mount and the line between reality and delusion begin to fade.<br /><br />  The one thing this movie can't escape is that it's a character driven film that doesn't have any characters worth caring about. While many critics have noted the similarities between this film and Aronofsky's last movie The Wrestler, I feel like latter movie succeeded much more because it had characters you could actually sympathize with.  Sure, Mickey Rourke played an over the hill, self-absorbed, and alcoholic wrestler, but man, when he belted out singing \\"Round and Round\\" at the bar to Marisa Tomei, it was hard not to love the guy.<br /><br />  When is all is said and done, it's an average story with great performance that Aronofsky directs the hell out of. I just found it tough at times to really make sense of it all. What's that? We're supposed to figure it out ourselves? Screw that. I'm watching Toy Story.
B0044XV3R8|3.0|The movie is fantastic, no doubt about it. But the disc one in my set is not functioning probably and it keeps skipping on my players (tested on 2 DVD players, and disc one is still \\"unviewable\\")..Luckily Amazon allows me to exchange for a new set. Thanks so much!
1400052173|5.0|I just received this book over the holidays and I can honestly say that I could hardly put it down. The book is about Henrietta Lacks, a poor African American woman who died from an aggressive form of cervical cancer. Henrietta's cells were taken without her or her family's consent and were instrumental in many medical breakthroughs over the years, including experimentations for the cure for polio and other diseases.<br /><br />For years scientists had been trying to grow cells so that they could experiment with them in a search for cures for many diseases. However, many of the cells would die after a while. It wasn't until someone took a collection of Henrietta's cancer cells that her cells began to immediately multiply. Soon scientists all over the world were using her cells in experiments. Meanwhile, Henrietta's own family knew nothing about it and had little access to health care.<br /><br />Who would have thought that a study of cells or cancer could be so interesting? I'm not much of a science enthusiast, but I was fascinated by the historical aspect of how women were treated for cancer, as well as issues of the health care system as it has served poor and African American patients. It's hard for me to believe that fifty years ago that radium was being packed into a cervix in order to cure cancer. I was absolutely shocked also at some of the ethical issues that were presented in the book, such as doctors injecting Henrietta's cancer cells into unsuspecting patients in an effort to study cancer. Unbelievable!<br /><br />The end of the book provides information about the current state of affairs regarding cells and the medical industry. Did you know that when hospitals take your blood and tissue that it is later labeled as \\"waste\\" and that companies can take it to do experiments and make money off of it? Some companies even have patents on certain DNA markers and they control the experimentation and tests that can be done on the DNA. There have even been some people who have sold their blood to companies if they have something unique in their blood, such as an antibody. Fascinating stuff, indeed. It practically reads right out of a science fiction novel!<br /><br />What I also loved about the book was the issue of race relations. Henrietta's family was African American and the author was white. Henrietta's family (along with many other African Americans) have historically been denied quality health care and are distrustful of the medical establishment for various reasons that are delineated in the book \\"Medical Apartheid\\", including the famous Tuskegee experiments where patients were given syphilis and were not treated for many years. In this book, Henrietta's family was distrustful of the author due to these issues, as well as the fact that many people tried to take advantage of the family when they found out who they were. This book is more than just a story about Henrietta and her cells-it's a story about how trust and friendship were also fostered over the years between Henrietta's daughter and the author as they both learned about Henrietta's life and legacy.ir blood to companies if they have something unique in their blood, such as an antibody.

B001FB5634|3.0|Overview:<br /><br />This film appears to be taking place after the Rapture, when the earth is under judgment. Society as we know it has ceased to exist. In a post-apocalyptic environment a man and his son are trying to survive by any means possible. The destination is the warmer south, hopefully the environment would be more hospitable there.<br /><br />Storyline/Plot:<br /><br />We join a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son on the road to betterment. But are they on the right road? Or is it really better anywhere else? Bitter cold, and hunger grip them along the way. Also, they must keep moving and be very aware of others who may want to kill or steal from them.<br /><br />This is a brutal film with the harsh realities that may face humanity that have rejected God in their hearts.<br /><br />In the end there is really no real earthly destination that is a sanctuary for man to run to. The time of the escape has already past. It is really the final journey of lost souls as they seek to find peace and rest, but they have run away and have hidden themselves from all who now seek them.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This movie can be emotionally draining, you keep your hopes up that things will improve but that is really only wishful thinking, at least until the credits start to roll. If you enjoy watching people suffering, then this may be one of your favorites.

B001U0HBPG|3.0|This film is best described as two ships passing eachother in the night.<br /><br />The essence of the film is about a man who is aging backwards, who falls in love with a woman who is aging normally. The process of time eventually takes its toll on their relationship.<br /><br />It is a melancholy tale, of interest is the CG effects, that provides an unusual set of aging effects for Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt).<br /><br />In my opinion, this is more of a rental, than a collector's piece.
0756665949|2.0|This is a very perculiar product. It isn't quite an encyclopedia because it it isn't very comprehensive. It is more a picture or coffee table book  but not a particularly good one. There are several flaws, the most obvious:    1) Poor editing and structure. This is unacceptable for any published book.    2) Odd topics to focus on. For example, there is a two page spread on backgammon (!) with most of the pages taken up by a big close up photo of the game! There is also a two-page spread on Mr Clucks Chicken Shack that merely shows a massive photo of Hurly and Mr Clucks Code of Ethics. Does anyone really care? There is also two page spreads with no titles, hence, no real context. For example, there is a chart showing the relative heights of animals--including the smoke monster--that has no relevance to the show whatsoever.     3) Odd \\"explanations\\" that were never described on the show. The writers made it very clear that they were going to make a descriptive account of the show and not speculate or invite theory. But there are several \\"explanations\\" that are just plain dumb. They explain that the light Locke saw was actually the Monster flashing, downloading his thoughts (as we see throughout the series). It is clear on the episode in question that this was not happening and is later confused when the light from the heart of the island is revealed. Isn't this what John saw? It is explained that the entity in Jabob's cabin was the smoke monster and he created a mock \\"haunting\\" as part of his \\"long con\\". What does this mean? How on earth was the so called haunting part of the smoke monster's overall plan? It is also explained that Nicki and Paulo were bitten by not the medusa spiders but the smoke monster pretending to be the spiders. This may be what Carlton and Cuse were intending but it adds nothing to the overall story and is just plain dumb.     Overall, this is a pretty ok product that isn't reall an encyclopedia. It needs more attention to detail and structure.An index wouldn't have hurt either.

0525951652|3.0|The cast of characters is long and the story is epic.  Fall of Giants follows the lives of five interrelated families: American, Russian, English, German, and Welsh.  We follow these families as they move through life during the times of the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the hard struggle for women's right to vote.<br /><br />Billy Williams is a thirteen-year-old boy who enters the mines on the day of this 13th birthday.  He has now become a man like so many other 13-year-olds before him in the tiny Welsh town of Aberowen.  Gus Dewar is an American law student who is rejected in love but finds a new career working for then President, Woodrow Wilson, in the White House.<br /><br />Grigori and Lev Peshkov, two Russian brothers who were orphaned set out on very different paths half a world away from each other when their plan to emigrate to the United States falls apart because of the war, conscription, and the revolution.<br /><br />Billy's sister, Ethel, is a housekeeper for the aristocratic Fitzherberts and takes a fateful step above her station as housekeeper just as Lady Maud Fitzherbert herself crosses deep into forbidden territory when she falls in love with Walter von Ulrich, a spy at the German embassy in London.<br /><br />Each of these characters and a raft of others find their lives entangled as, in a saga of unfolding drama and intriguing complexity.  The story moves from Washington, D.C. to St. Petersburg, Russia, from the dirt and danger of a coal mine to the glittering chandeliers of a palace, from the hallways of power to the bedrooms of the mighty and beyond.<br /><br />Although the story was good, I was a tad disappointed as I did not find this story nearly as good as `Pillars of the Earth' or `World Without End'.  I think we were spoiled with those two novels and anything less than that is going to be a disappointment.  I'm hoping the second book in the trilogy coming out in the Fall of 2011 will be much better than Fall of Giants.

B000JQUKKU|4.0|The story is obviously amazing and I won't attempt to contribute anything there.  There are some formatting issues though, mostly in the form of extra line break inexplicably inserted in the middle of paragraphs, and not distracting enough to detract from the overall reading experience.  Also worth noting is the lack of an interactive table of contents.

0060899220|5.0|I read Medium Raw because a friend recommended it and I enjoyed it.  After reading it, I learned that Anthony Bourdain became famous with his mega hit, Kitchen Confidential. So, I got Kitchen Confidential. First, I enjoyed Kitchen Confidential way more then Medium Raw. The Kitchen Confidential was more engaging, the characters more wacky and I actually felt I entered his world. I learnt what a character, Bourdain  is.<br /><br />For someone who went to the best schools, he acts like he's from the hood and like he said , he rebelled against everything normal. He is smart and a very good writer which I disagree with some of the other reviewers.<br /><br />I recommend this book for several reasons: One is I marvel how he was able to work for 12 hours,party all night and still got up and wrote for two hours this book.( Maybe cocaine had something to do with it.)<br /> Also, he really knows the inner workings of restaurants, this book is more like an expose, then a book. He shows everything  the good, bad and ugly. The main thing i got is what it takes to be a first rate cook and i was surprise that if someone asked him today if they should be a cook, he would say no. And last, in this updated version, Bourdain talks about the glamorization of cooks today which in his opinion is good and bad. Read the book to find out.
044654759X|5.0|This is now my favorite of Sparks's books. The ending was a wonderful surprise. I love a good twist. As much as I have enjoyed all of Nicholas Sparks books, they are usually pretty predictable. I thought I had this one figured out, but I was WRONG. I loved it!
1439177783|5.0|This story is very well written.  It has helped me to understand how bulimia and anorexia can affect a person.  Portia did a terrific job of really letting the reader feel what she felt and living how she lived.  Such amazing courage and strength.  So proud of her and her ability to overcome such difficulty.
0062513346|4.0|The book was not properly cut: many of the pages were still stuck together.  Also, the same pages were longer than the cover and they had to be cut with scissors.<br /><br />Other than that, the book was fine.
0061990477|5.0|As I progressed in my attempt to master the art of writing fiction, I stumbled across The Thorn Birds by Colleen McCullough. Naturally interested in doing something of a saga covering several generations, I gravitated toward this remarkable book. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Rather than going into the usual reader reviews about the book, I'd like to concentrate on what I found interesting, as a writer, and how that helped me in my writing. First off, the book is a love story between two people, Meggie Cleary and Father Ralph Bricassart, and how their love developed and expanded over a period of some twenty years. Ralph was drawn to Meggie, and vice versa, but in particular he struggled with his vow of celibacy, trying to curtail his natural attraction to her. This is conflict of a supreme nature, and something a writer needs to learn how to use.<br /><br />There are other characters who are conflicted in one way or another:  Fiona, who withholds love because of a betrayal; Frank, who is tormented by his violence and the secret he carries; Justine, who like her grandmother, Fiona, withholds love because she is afraid of being hurt. These are the things that create conflict in a good book.<br /><br />Minor characters added to the breadth of the novel, and served to illuminate the main characters and allow the reader to expand his knowledge of them.<br /><br />The dialogue was done quite well and deftly interwoven into the plot, allowing the reader to glimpse, through a character's own words, more insight into him or her, and thus propel the plot forward while arming the reader with a greater understanding of these characters.<br /><br />The pacing of the novel did not falter. To have written such a work requires, of course, a comprehensive outline and character sketches for all characters. This outline allows the author to set the pace of the novel, and also to avoid stumbling into the pit of having one person's eyes blue in one chapter and brown in another. When to pump up the action and when to let it settle like a leaf falling to the ground is accomplished by following the outline, or changing it, as I'm sure Ms. McCullough must have done over the course of writing this masterly creation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.et it settle like a leaf falling to the ground is accomplished by following the outline, or changing it, as I'm sure Ms. McCullough must have done over the course of writing this masterly creation.

0312539525|5.0|This was one of those books that someone gives you, and you kind of look askance at them for giving it to you until you start reading it. Then, as you progress through the pages you begin to really like what you're reading...The book, then, is about the mountain climber George Mallory whose body was discovered on Mt. Everest in 1999, some seventy-five years after his untimely disappearance in 1924.<br /><br />One reviewer complains about starting the book this way and then having \\"a long flashback.\\" I disagree. If I wrote the book I would have done it the same way. The three page Prologue serves as what is called a \\"hook\\" in the writing trade, and that is what caught my attention. Specifically, when Mallory's body was discovered, Conrad Anker went through the dead man's pockets and pulled out items he believed belonged to Mallory. There was even the handstitched pouch which wife Ruth had made and given to Mallory. But when Conrad Anker looked inside the pouch for a picture of Ruth, the one item which would positively identify Mallory, he exclaimed, \\"There's no photograph of Ruth.\\" That was the \\"hook\\" and that, precisely, was what got my attention. Immediately, I wanted to find out the truth:  was this Mallory or someone else?<br /><br />Read on to find out the answer!
B000W91RUG|5.0|What would happen if a beautiful blond moved in next door to a couple of research geeks? Probably not what takes place in most episodes of this hysterical sit-com. But the acting, authentic dialogue, and writing on this show make it a must-see for us normal intellect geeks. The stories mainly revolve around the three main characters, Penny, Leonard, and Sheldon. However, other episodes feature the rest of the ensemble cast, Howard and Raj. Warning: Some of the movie, comic book, etc. references will make no sense to some viewers, but it doesn't matter. The stories and characters supply more than enough laughs to satisfy the pop-culture-challenged.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|This is a great set for any LOST fan.  I missed the last 2 seasons, so some of what is in the collection doesn't mean anything to me, but I showed it to my mom and she got very excited.     The DVDs are packaged well. All of the ones I have looked at so far are in pristine condition, so the thin sleeves don't seem to be a problem.
B002ZG9940|4.0|This is NOT an action film, or even remotely Hollywood in any way; it's a quiet character study. So don't watch it if, like many of the reviewers here, you need Action! Thrills! Excitement! Combining the slow, peaceful feel of '60s and '70s European cinema with Leone's Man With No Name series, The American works due to Clooney's finely measured performance and director Anton Corbijn's gorgeous sense of composition and light.<br /><br />I picked up this blu-ray (a sweet transfer with a fair but short doc and a few deleted scenes as extras) when I saw Corbijn's name, as I've loved his photography since seeing his first album covers in the late '70s, and his classic Art Of Noise Beat Box video in 1983. His work for U2 around The Joshua Tree era was iconic, and he's done so much gorgeous art I figured this would at least look good. And that it does, very much so. The splendid Italian Abruzzo hill country makes this film come alive, and the many fine supporting actors bring a solid sense of realism to the proceedings. Which is why a few blown details were rather irking..<br /><br />[Spoilers...] I just can't buy that after a bunch of shots, a crashed car with a dead man inside and shot-out windows and tires, along with an innocent local shot to death up the street, nobody is around to look, nor that the police don't have the town swarmed the next day. And why does the gun blow up at the end? Did George do it on purpose? And falling in love with the hooker didn't really gel either. But oh well, I guess you just have to take what you get.<br /><br />And most of what we get here is very good indeed. As long as you're not waiting on a murder a minute like most modern thrillers, you'll get many fine moments here, including a nice opening shock. Ultimately, this is very much a European film, not even vaguely Hollyweird, and that's a lot of what's so good about it. The American is for film fans who appreciate quiet beauty as much or more than thrills and spills.

B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Another great hit by Kid Rock.  The last 10 years has slowly been evolving into this album.  if you are looking for a Lynyrd Skynryd substitute, you found the right album.  You can hear that he is starting to feel his age and wants to kick back a little and relax.  He has his 3rd duet with Sheryl Crow that I would rate in the middle.  Not as good as \\"Picture\\", but still a little better than \\"Run off to LA\\".    My disappointment is that he didn't show much of the Kid Rock diversity I usually look for in an album.  I personally love Kid Rock because he is a little Country, Rap and Rock.  He likes it all and pulls it together well, this album is all country/southern rock.  he even tries falsetto in \\"For the First Time\\" which was surprising and I wasn't sure what to think at first.  The more you listen to it, it begins to grow on you, but not really the best on the album.  My fav would have to be \\"Slow My Roll\\"
030746363X|3.0|I was surprised to see how many of the suggestions in this book were of the do-it-100%-like-this-or-it-won't-work variety. It's obvious the slow-carb diet will work. You'll live longer, or at least it will seem longer. But it's consists of draconian restrictions for the sake of a marginal (if any) advantage over other, more flexible plans. Occam's Protocol for muscle building is likewise draconian in the sense that apparently it must be followed to the letter or it won't work. Limiting your physical activity to a couple of hours a month is not necessarily a selling point for everyone. Some of the chapters. like that on swimming, tell you to go out and buy a different book. One last thing--it may well be true, as Tim suggests, that women unable to climax simply haven't yet encountered the necessary stimulus. But I think that stimulus is likely to be mental rather than a matter of finger positioning. I'm quite willing to believe that a woman who had never been able to climax had her first mind-blowing multiple orgasm thanks to Tim. Sorry, though--I just can't buy that this took place in a room with several people watching and taking notes. (Unless... it was the people watching and taking notes that was the missing stimulus all along? Which is fine with me--I'm not judgmental about such things--but that's not every woman.)
0739309013|3.0|A solid story from John Grisham with an easy, enjoyable pace.  Although its billed as an action adventure--who's killing the jury?--this is more of a character study set in a small, southern town circa 1970.      Young Willy Trainer becomes the owner of a newspaper that coverages everything from the obits to the garden club meetings to an infamous murder trial.  Along the way, we meet the local eccentrics, all whom Grisham creates to perfection.  The main event is the murder trial of a young widow killed by a member of the local drug-dealing, bad-guy family.  After conviction, there is a threat against the jurors who participated in the trial.  Ten years later, some of those jurors start dying.      I am a Grisham fan.  I like his gentle, predictable characters.  The good guy always win, most often walking away into a tropical paradise with a boatload of money.  In my mind, that is always a suitable ending.

It is by far my most favorite Holiday movie to date.  The Santa in this movie is the real deal...he will have any non-believer become a believer.  It captures that feeling of the magic of Christmas.  What it is like to be a child..the excitement and wonder of experiencing Christmas through a child's eyes.  I love how the movie in the beginning explains how Santa Claus came to be! This movie is near and dear to my heart....it may be old and cannot compete with the visual effects of todays movies, but it is a classic in my opinion!
0060989157|5.0|I never had the pleasure of seeing their concerts,but nevertheless I am a fan from way back when. However different their personalities are and each one certainly brought in his own unique style, they came together as one in their music and that's what this is all about.  Making the music, making it work and they certainly did. The book is open and honest.  It's through Mick Mars' own style of playing that encouraged me to take up the guitar, learning about the great blues players past and present and of course I proudly have my first tattoo of Mick Mars on my arm and I'm getting a second tattoo next month. Again I'll say it's about the music, of where it came from and where it began.  It's about the joy I get from listening to their music, dancing to their music and growing old throughout the years, \\"along with the music\\".  Thank you Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil and Tommy Lee.  Thanks for this and for this joy ride called life.<br /><br />Lisa-K, a proud 'age 58'- going strong (with the music).

B00368PSN2|4.0|Outlander is technically about an alien warrior who happens to land on Earth, bringing with him a beast called a moorwen.  This would be a standard alien-out-of-water-hunts-monster plot, but Outlander has a few tricks up its sleeve.  For one, the film takes place in 709 AD at the height of the Viking Age. For another, the moorwen is an innovative beast; part feline predator, part bioluminescent angler fish. And the moorwen isn't alone--it travels with an equally violent cub.<br /><br />This combination of factors makes for a highly entertaining, if rather single-minded, monster movie.  The arrival of outlander Kainan (James Caviezel) and the moorwen that crashed his ship tips the delicate balance of power between Viking King Rothgar (John Hurt) and Rus leader Gunnar (Ron Perlman). Each side blames the other for the devastation wrought by the moorwen, and nobody believes poor Kainan's tale of a \\"dragon\\" that destroyed his \\"ship.\\" There's a subplot between mopey heir-apparent Wulfric (Jack Huston) and hottie warrior princess Freya (Sophia Myles) but they have so little chemistry that the audience already knows who the fiery redhead will end up with.<br /><br />The real star is the moorwen. It is a fully realized CGI creation.  The lighting effects are breathtaking as the moorwen's bioluminescence changes to match its mood. It uses these glowing lures to draw Vikings into its clutches and as a weapon to blind its enemies. Mundane weapons are useless against such a foe.<br /><br />Fortunately there's Kainan, who arrives to teach the Vikings how to trap the creature.  Then it's a journey into the moorwen's lair to finish its offspring.  If this combination of Vikings, outsiders, monsters and mommies sounds familiar it's because Outlander is a Beowulf retelling with sci-fi trappings.<br /><br />Outlander focuses a bit too much on Kainan's past, a past that's bog-standard sci-fi: greedy-colonist-finds-redemption-on-backwater-planet. Freya, who demonstrates her proficiency with a sword early in the movie, spends most of her time in a really poor wardrobe choice as a damsel-in-distress. And Kainan's alien culture remains oddly ill-defined.  But all that is excusable in light of the amazing special effects, cool alien monsters, and Vikings fighting alien monsters.<br /><br />If you can shelve your expectations and knowledge of Viking history for a few hours, Outlander will not disappoint.ie, spends most of her time in a really poor wardrobe choice as a damsel-in-distress.

B004AKCMD4|5.0|When complex animation is mentioned, most people think of Avatar as the benchmark, but the characters in Avatar had wooden faces compared to the range of expression given to these owls. This has to be the best animation I have ever seen. Not only is almost every scene incredibly beautiful, but the characterization is amazing. With little more than eyes and a beak to work with the animators have created subtle expressions that give each owl a unique personality. On top of that there is a feather physics system that allows the animal's feathers to ruffle when they speak or move and even in response to the slightest breeze or movement. Incredible!<br /><br />The storyline here is a simple one, the battle between good and evil and the coming of age of a would be hero, Soren. You won't be dazzled by the simple plot which has been done many times, but you'll be so amazed by the images, flight scenes, mid-air battles and characterizations that you won't care. From the sweet humble Soren to the cold Queen Nyra (voice of Helen Mirren),the only low spot in the entire film is a very poorly suited vocal track inserted during a training session at the Tree of the Guardians. The silly pop song \\"To the Sky\\" ruined that whole segment for me and I literally had to mute the volume. Check out the soundtrack on Amazon and compare it (only song done by OWL CITY) to the rest of the soundtrack which was done by David Hirschfelder who also did some of the music for the movie \\"Shine\\" and appears to understand what a film score is supposed to accomplish.  I can only imagine that it was the work of someone's relative who needed a music credit. It flies in stark contrast to the song that follows which is associated with a zen-like flight scene. That song is \\"The Host of Seraphim\\" done by Dead Can Dance's, Lisa Gerrard. This is not on the soundtrack but it is available here. In spite of that awful song the movie still rates a well earned 5 stars.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is an extremely touching and satisfying look at the struggles of Prince Albert, Duke of York and second son of King George V, with a severe stammer that made it almost impossible for him to speak in public.  This made his royal duties torturous and agonizing, for the Duke as well as for his listeners.  Fortunately, the Duke (known as Bertie to his family) had an advocate: his wife Elizabeth.  Elizabeth tracked down Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist who managed, over a period of years, to help Bertie overcome much of his speech difficulties.  This became even more important in 1936, when Bertie's older brother suddenly abdicated the throne, forcing him to become King George VI.<br /><br />This movie is a magnificent historical tale combined with deep human drama.  The stellar cast does an impressive job recreating the world of the 1930s, with Britain in economic depression and facing a rising threat from Nazi Germany. Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter do an especially fine job as George VI and Queen Elizabeth, which is important because there are fewer and fewer Britons still living who can remember him, while most people remember the late Queen Mother as a befeathered and bejeweled old lady smiling and waving.  The story of the King and Queen's great struggles and the work they put in to speak for and inspire the British people during some of their darkest hours deserves to be better known, and The King's Speech does much to make that possible.

B002ZG993Q|5.0|THE AMERICAN is decidedly not an American made movie.  The subtlety and intelligence of foreign films is everywhere evident - the minimal dialogue, the use of poignant silences, the lighting of tense moments, and the acting. Dutch director Anton Corbijn has achieved just the right amount of subdued tension that propels this story based on Martin Booth's novel  'A Very Private Gentleman' and adapted for the screen by Rowan Joffee. The result is an understated elegy about fear and questions of trust.<br /><br />The film opens in snowbound Sweden where assassin Jack (George Clooney, pared down physically and giving a performance of extraordinary subtlety), thinking that he is hiding, is discovered and must flee.  He receives instructions from his 'boss' Pavel (Johan Leysen) to go to a small town in Italy to await further assignments and to make no friends.  In the little Italian town Jack receives his next assignment - to build a very small but deadly weapon for a Belgian assassin Mathilde (Thekla Reuten).  Jack agrees to this 'last assignment', gathers the materials for the weapon, meeting the town priest  Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli) who is able to read Jack like few others  ('You cannot deny the existence of hell. You live in it. It is a place without love.') and assists Jack in finding parts for the weapon from one Fabio (Filippo Timi) who has a close physical resemblance to the old priest. Jack also encounters a prostitute Clara (Violante Placido) and finds his business arrangement with her evolving into something more meaningful.  Jack's life is further disrupted when a Swedish assassin finds Jack's hiding place and Jack must destroy or be destroyed.  He finally completes the weapon for Mathilde, the weapon is accepted, and Jack decides to make good on his decision to have this as his last assignment.  But fate has a different idea and the ending of the film is intensely dramatic.<br /><br />This is a very quiet movie; the musical score by Herbert Gr&ouml;nemeyer is most often a single finger piano score, the cinematography by Martin Ruhe captures the beauty of both snowy Sweden and isolated Italy while keeping a close focus on the sensitive face of Clooney.  Though this film will not please those who love  loud, conflagration CGI effects, for those who enjoy the beauty of understatement and sensitive character studies this film is first class. The film is as much about what is not said or shown as it is with the quiet action it provides.  It is a pleasure to see George Clooney expand his acting horizons this way.

0446691437|3.0|Altho I got little tired of the monotone in which the author writes. It has a hectoring feel, and it is a much shorter book than it seems, since many of the pages have only a brief paragraph of text. Maybe that's what people like about it. It could have been shorter, still, imo, but seems to have been padded a bit, as there is not much information and very little that is new. It reads like a summary of certain other books. The section I found most interesting was the one about angels and the forces that ally with you when you make a commitment to your true work, and even that has been done before and better by other authors. I have no idea where all the 5-star reviews came from. There are many books on the market on creativity. Many are at least okay, like this one. I think it is a matter of being in the right frame of mind and finding one of them.    The only major problem I had with the book is the number of times he mentions the invocation to the muse from T.E. Lawrence's translation of The Odyssey -- before he actually gives you the text. I imagine the book's short chapters were written separately and put in order later, but it seems like it should have been easy to put the text of the invocation in the first time it's mentioned. By the third mention, I was wondering if he was having copyright problems with it. Then, there it was, about 4/5 of the way through the book. Poor editing, but I guess we are expected to deal with this nowadays.
0061997811|5.0|I got this for Christmas and have to say, it's one of my favorite gifts!  All of the information (IE:  Alan Rickman was iffy about playing Snape???  WHAT??? Tom Felton didn't audition for Draco Malfoy at first.... He auditioned for Harry???) and the beautiful pictures are almost overwhelming.  And we get so many little extras like Harry's letter inviting him to Hogwarts, a ticket to the Yule Ball and even a map of Hogwarts like in POA.  I couldn't be more happy with this book.  There's even a little section on HP7!!!!  An absolute must have for any HP fan!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I was initially reluctant to pay the high price for this product, as I already own practically every piece of Springsteen music and video in existence. But boy, am I glad I did! This is an absolutely wonderful package, with incredible care and attention to detail and materials. The recreation of Bruce's notebook is a brilliant idea, the music sounds great and the concert DVDs are wonderful. I couldn't recommend this more.
B0042KZJR8|2.0|Though I love Buble's voice, I should have KNOWN better than to buy a live concert cd - -you have to sit through all the clapping and whistling.  I have only listened to this cd once, and it just didn't do enough for me to listen to it again - yet.
B001AX9DT0|4.0|This CD has some the prettiest toned songs I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. I can listen to Let It Be me over and over. The only song I don't care for is #7 Hey Me, Hey Mama. I can tell it's a good song musically I just don't think it belongs with the other songs. I love, adore, worship (take your pick) #8 Henry Nearly Killed Me. I love the feeling I get of an old-fashioned locomotive zooming down the tracks at breakneck speed. Even Meg White has an appeal that the actual Meg White does not.
B0041QSZJM|4.0|There were no surprises in this cd. Pink Martini remains one of the most creative arrangers in the music biz, but this cd seems not to be one that will go down in the books as the finest.
B000002UAF|5.0|I received this CD as a gift for Christmas, and it was from EMI Records. Before I opened it a sticker on the back caught my attention that said \\"Product for sale exclusively in South America except Brazil.\\" After spending days trying to figure out on the internet if the CD would still play on my American CD player, I finally put it in and it played fine. The CD is awesome and plays wonderfully.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Great Movie gave as a gift to stepson and he loves it.  Same story but new action which was a great change of pace
B00275EHJG|5.0|My 18 year old son is a freshman in college.  He grew up watching the first two Toy Stories.  The third was released the week he graduated from high school. He and his friends went to see it on opening day; they love this movie. I finally watched it with him at Christmas and I can see why.  The Pixar folks are amazing story tellers.  Who else could tell such a poignant tale - growing up, but from the toy's perspective.  What happens to the things we loved now that we've put aside \\"childish things?\\"  It had me tearing up a few times.  A perfect ending to a lovely series.
B00402FGDK|5.0|I got this for my college age daughter for Christmas, she hasn't stopped watching it since she got it.  She loves it!
B0030BOCKK|5.0|I am a big HIM fan, and I absolutely love this album.  The mood is really self reflective and deep, and any Ville Valo fan should love it!  I had the opportunity of interviewing Ville for my first book \\"The Successful Rebel\\" [[ASIN:1425186548 The Successful Rebel: Getting What You Want Without Losing Who You Are]]with my co author Melissa Ireland, and the 53 pages of interviews with Ville about life, love and success really stood out among all of our rebel's interviews.<br /><br />Ville Valo and HIM are one of my favorite bands, and I'd recommend this album to anyone!
B000I0QK74|4.0|There used to be a time when we would only be bombarded with clich&eacute; versions of Christmas Songs following Thanksgiving. Thanks to the marketing crowed we are now slowly changing Christmas from a holy day into a shopping holiday, for shame. My rant now finished, back to the review. I really enjoy listening to the wide range of world music that has celebrated this wondrous religious holiday. And so it is with great pleasure that I recommend to you this warm, and cozy CD from one of our very talented musicians, James Taylor.  I think the review by B. Niedt of Cherry Hill, N.J. pretty much sums up my feelings about this recording which is a worthy addition to any Christmas music collection.  May you all have a Happy Hanukah, Merry Christmas, and a healthy and Happy New Year.
0446677450|1.0|A book that does not inform at all. Kiyosaki is extremely short on detail and long on repetition. At the end of the book you are simply left with the feeling, the vague notion \\"yes, I can do it too\\", but when it comes to \\"HOW\\" you get absolutely no hint from the book. How to you create a company? Well, after long searching through this an other books he simply states \\"turn you ideas into companies\\" - no kidding, really? Could he be any more general, any more avoiding real information? Where is the meat? Where is the detail? Where is the true help?  He mentions over and over and over again that he listened to dinner conversations at rich dad's table about business...but never graces us with a single concrete real tip, no hint of what he overheard, no help for the reader. and this is typical for the whole book. Motivation, maybe, but true help - not at all. I find repetition after repetition of the same vague concepts, over and over and then over again. He could have used those pages to present some real, true actionable knowledge, but no, he drifts trough more and more vague repetitions - all on a 6th grade level.  You could easily summarize the whole book on one page. What a waste  Very disappointing.....
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Without a doubt, the portrayal of David Tennant as the tenth incarnation of the time travelling Time Lord has been one of the most popular of the new series....and what fan of the Doctor wouldn't be caught without a replica of his sonic screwdriver...in lieu of the actual article, of course.    First off, it looks great.  The packaging...well, not so much.  It was quite a effort to cut into it and get all the tiny bits (batteries, extra ink nub, etc) out...    An awesome replica.  A bit on the light side, but that was unavoidable.  Lights and sound are a bit touchy as well, but with some practice, you'll be up to Time Lord standards in no time.    A warning...it feels a bit fragile, but it's tougher than it looks.  It sits on my stereo speaker next to the Tenth Doctor's Flight Control Tardis and really sets it off.  A definate must-have for Tennant fans.
B000NA28I4|1.0|My step mom and sis read the book before conning me into reading it. I liked it, although I could definitely see other book plots mashed into it. So when the movie came out we were all excited, expecting something similar in relation to how LOTR was made.<br />...<br />...<br />We were furious, to say the least. Throughout the movie I cringed and smacked my forehead, flabbergasted at how absolutely HORRIBLE the movie was. My bro and other step sis, who hadn't read the books, thought the movie was fine, but after the credits rolled the three of us who had read it wheeled towards each other and gushed the major differences in the movie. Eragon didn't look like...Eragon. Saphira's transformation from baby dragon to adult had us rolling on the floor, laughing like lunatics. It was the dumbest way imaginable to skip the chunks of the book about her growing up and moving on in the story line. The journey from Carvahall to Tronjheim is a joke, as no other towns/cities the duo encounter in the book is mentioned, besides one.  Galbatorix's bit is only a 5 second blip that lets you know the general gist of what's happening on that end. And Arya...<br />...<br />...I want to cry at how pathetic that was. I can't believe that they couldn't spend 5 bucks at a costume shop and buy her stupid pointy ears! What elf DOESN'T HAVE POINTY EARS?!?!?!? And towards the end, when she and Eragon said goodbye after defeating Durza, I swore they were going to kiss! Okay, Eragon likes Arya, but she doesn't like him in that way back...So, WHY did they perceive that in the movie????<br />I don't know what's going on with  movie adaptations these days, but they're getting more and more worse. Please, spare yourself from the torture of watching this horrific movie and spend your money elsewhere!
B0025KVLT2|5.0|This is the best the Beatles put out.  I was in high school when this album was originally released.  All of the songs except for a couple were hits.
B003EYVXXW|2.0|I came to this film after reading promo reviews of two highly respected Aussie critics, who described it as visually stunning. It was not!!! The premise was poor. Ignorant religious bigots destroy books and knowledge, and lives. Gee, nothing revealing in that. This movie was a waste of time and money. You could argue that it depicted the superpower as the real villain, but you wouldn't convince me it did it well. I mean, what superpower would manipulate religious morons for its own political ends...?? Yes of course, all of them.
B004IM14RY|5.0|For whatever reason I can't get myself to read why people rated this film 3 stars. Let me just say that this film replaced the definition of the word, mesmerizing in my dictionary and filled it with something else, sand.<br /><br />Buried is a real film with the most amazing storyline. It is in the same category as SAW. Of course there is going to be no sequels to this film, thankfully.<br /><br />Ryan Renolds acts absolutely magnificently. Highly recommeneded. Easily one of the best films of 2010.
0439023491|5.0|There is something so wonderful and so frustrating about a good cliffhanger ending. Catching Fire has one of those endings that leaves me with my jaw hanging open and going \\"Huh-what? What just happened?\\" The whole huge plot twist is within the last couple of pages, and it's abrupt and amazing and overwhelming all at once.<br /><br />*Sorta-Spoiler* Like, where' Peeta? Is he still alive? Where's Katniss's family? What happened to Gale's family? And WTF happened  to District 12?!<br /><br />Normally, I give myself a little time to absorb a book before jumping into the next, to think about my review. I am so desperate to start Mockingjay I literally hand-wrote this moments after closing the book, so I can get my Catching Fire thoughts out of my head, and stay up all night reading the final book.<br /><br />I also can't believe Mockingjay is it! I'm nervous about starting it, actually. Can it all be resolved in only one more book? And I still can't make up my mind. I think I'm still team Peeta, but I do like Gale quite a bit too. I think I'll just vote for Katniss to start her own pretty-boy harem. :D<br /><br />: Left me even more eager than the ending of Hunger Games did! The plot twist, not only once, but twice, is mind-boggling, and I can't wait to dive head-first into Mockingjay.<br /><br />(originally posted @ The Tealeaf Review)
B003H9MSPG|3.0|It is your typical Nerf gun- but does not shoot as far as the box says- in fact it shoot less than some of the smaller ones.
030726999X|5.0|If you enjoy good read...one that keeps you on the edge of your seat, this is the book for you. Steig Larsons books are definitely for those who love trivia and great knowledge drops. You learn as you literally get caught up in his stories.  I've never been to Sweden, but after reading all three books, I feel as though I could travel the path Lisbeth has taken eluding those who have treated her so poorly her entire life.  She's a kick-butt kinda of woman, with a moral code that's all her own.  Just don't get her in her way, or hurt anyone she loves. If you opt to read all of the Lisbeth Salander books, be sure to read them in order. Enjoy!
0765348276|5.0|John Scalzi's book has a great hook. The hero is a 75 year old widower who is joining the Army. The book's focus is on telling the story from the point of view of the hero. He doesn't give away much about the universe the hero lives in. A lot of it he doesn't know about. With any luck John will fill out the details about this world in later books. The book gets better and better as the story progresses but may be a little slow to start for the impatient. I do recommend the book without reservation.
B000MTPAHW|5.0|This movie is not only a classic but its the best. Just as good as the first time we saw it, car chase still will get you to the edge of your seat. Awesome movie.
0439023483|5.0|The first book in \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy is captivating. I couldn't put it down until I finished it, then I went out and bought the other two books. I highly recommend it to any book lover I meet-teen to adult. I purchased multiple copies of each book to share with others. As an elementary school librarian, I have placed the book on my annual \\"Battle of the Books\\" list for my students to read and discuss.  I do not recommend the book for readers younger than sixth grade because of the highly believable violence of the games and the moral issues that arise in the book that young readers may not understand completely.
0439023513|5.0|What can I say about Mockingjay that hasn't already been said a hundred times over? Best book of 2010? Probably. One of the best series to ever hit the young adult shelves? Definitely.     This is the series I would hand to someone who would never in a million years give young adult a chance. I would hand this to boys, girls, young or old. I will admit, I finished this over Christmas, and upon receiving a B&N gift card, the box set of this series was one of the first things I bought. I've become a total Hunger Games fan girl, and there's no going back at this point. I foresee t-shirts and key chains in my future.    The pace, as always, was fast, but never felt rushed. The entire time, I felt myself just wanting to reach out to Katniss, wanting to hug her and shake her silly all at the same time. This was probably the most tense of the books for me, understandably. There's a lot of freaky stuff that goes on in Mockingjay! The reptilian mutts? Totally creepy.     Really, I just want to gush until I'm blue in the face. I loved Katniss, as always, and I love her many transformations. I loved Peeta. I adored Finnick, Prim, and Buttercup. I laughed, I gasped, I cried. I never wanted it to end. The ending was, to me, the only way it could have ended. It was perfect, and left me warm and fuzzy inside, hoping that maybe finally, Katniss could be happy. Could I read ten more installments of the Hunger Games? Of course! But I'm glad it ended where it did, and I'm actually glad I waited so long to read the series. I don't think I would have survived the long wait between Catching Fire and Mockingjay with my sanity intact.    Really, if you haven't read it yet, you're insane. Pick up this series today! It's the perfect time, with all three out, and a movie set to start filming in 2011. Even if you don't like YA, I can almost guarantee you will fall in love with the Hunger Games.

B000YAA68C|5.0|I LOVE this movie!! A very sweet tear-jerker of a romance-comedy. Plus Gerard Butler is so hot! ;~)  I highly recommend that this be in everyone's rom-com collection.
B001GCUO4S|3.0|The grand finale? well if it was for this series,  it lacked that total flesh and blood gripping expectation one would have hoped to find in this genre. The story line was predictable, that being the for-telling of everyones gory demise, but where they had opportunity,(the writers that is)  they lacked more imagination, or not much imagination. Like,  the writter were getting tired of the same old and just wanted to get this over with. the FX were a little better in past 'episodes' of the blood fest and so in this one, made those 'suppose to be thrilling' moments a disappointment. like when the chick was in the car wash...NO!! you dont 'rescue' a girl that is about to be decapitated..[or so we thought] just before you think her head is gunna fly off and onto the floor...she's rescued...kind of like a pre-mature (you know!! :P) The elevator seen was to 'cut up' and the sequence wasnt quite right...made you sick that they blundered yet another juicy scene. Like having raced through the scene where she was getting grinded up,  lacked the SAW series kind of prolonged gore... that scene should have been a little slower with more bone crunching and flesh squeezing would have been delicious, and having her in shorty shorts would have been better. but I guess they were under budget. and didnt want to show much flesh...{like the tanning bed scene in #3} so they race her body through the gears like a tomatoe in a cusin art..there wasnt anything to savor...so for gore fans it was disappointing...and they blanked out a good deal of the truck crash into the diner...so were we really seeing a good horror flick...no..
0312370849|4.0|The story is of a young Jewish girl caught in the horror of the Holocaust, and a present day reporter who discovers a personal link to her, and ferrets out her story.    Sarah's (the Jewish girl) story is compelling.  Frankly, the reason I'm giving this book 4 stars vs. 5 is I would have liked to have read more about Sarah and less about the reporter.    Another bonus is that I learned some history about the Holocaust I had not previously known, concerning French involvement in it.
B004498KPU|2.0|These DVD's are very poorly authored.  It appears that the transfers didn't come from the original films but rather previous dvds/vhs tapes.  Very grainy often pixelated reproductions, especially if you are watching in high definition.  Don't waste your money.  Wait and see if they put together a more comprehensive compilation with better video quality.  Honestly, I wouldn't even classify these as \\"DVD quality\\" and you can forget about any semblance of definition.  In fact, you may feel like going to the eye doctor after watching this.
0446693804|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since I was ten years old, and I've always wanted to read the book but was scared it would make me hate the movie. I bought the book on my kindle last night and read the entire thing today. its a fantastic book because of the way Landon thinks, and how he is with Jamie. I have never read a book this quickly, and I highly recommend it. Its a great love story about teenagers who go through a lot together. i will most likely read countless more times.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I love this movie and I love Sandra Bullock. They did a fantastic job telling the story of Michael Oher. It's definitely in my top 5 dramas.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Was excited to read since it was my first book by author. I was very disappointed since it was all expected. It reminded me of a series of books i used to read in middle school.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Like others I am giving this book 5 stars without buying or reading it (yet) to help offset the 1 star ratings from the childish, idiotic cry babies protesting the cost of the Kindle version.    It was never a secret that Amazon was subsidizing the price of the Kindle version to the tune of $3 to $4 and that the price would eventually rise when they stopped.       Do these idiots actually think this childish behavior wiil change things? Rather they should donate their Kindles to a school or senior citizen center and go pay a few dollars more for the hardcover edition since they apparently feel better about that.  Or wait months to get it at the library - as if that free alternative did not exist when they bought their Kindle.     Grow up people!  You are purchasing the author's intellectual property - not the medium.    I - for one - would pay MORE for the Kindle edition due to the convenience and overall reading experience.  My time is far too valuable to spend driving across town to purchase the hardback edition from Costco - AND PAY MORE FOR IT!
B004CURZFC|5.0|I have to admit that I groaned a little when my twins decided on Legend of the Guardians for our weekly movie night pic, but it was a total hit and I have to admit that I loved it enough to watch it a second time!  The color and picture on this movie are fantastic, it has been such a long time since I have had the pleasure of watching such a beautiful film.     The story was interesting as well, even if it was the same basic storyline just with different animals, and kept the attention of several teens aged 14-19, as well as a couple little ones.  I am not one to watch animated films for more than background noise, and even when we do happen to pick one for our movie nights I will sit with the fam, but get work done on my laptop quietly.  I didn't get anything done because I was too into the movie-- both times.     Bottom line, great film and we will definitely be adding this to our home collection.
B0000CBHOI|5.0|Great overall review of blues from the beginning.  This is a wonderful collection and I would suggest this for any collector.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|First, I dont write a lot of product or movie reviews...but this one is worthy.  This is absolutely one of the funniest, most enjoyable movies we've seen in quite awhile.  There are touching moments as well as hilarious times....everyone was laughing out loud.  Visuals /  graphics are outstanding.  Every bit as good as compared to any Disney / Pixar work.  Cant go wrong...highly recommended.
B002DYKP88|5.0|I love this movie. I have added it to my collection of ku fu movies. Bright colors in these movies and I simply love it all.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|A page turner from the start.  Follet's historical accuracy adds to the emotional connection one feels for the brilliantly developed charecters.  Ken Follet is a literary genius.
159448385X|5.0|this book proves that we need to fight for the rights of all women and children in Afghanistan.  anyone who wondered why are troops are there should read this tale of two women and the life they must endure in a country of horror.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Duffy is the most original person that the music business has seen in a long time. This album is absolutely amazing!! I love her throwback 1960s style to it! Going into this album, \\"Mercy\\" was my favorite, but my picks of the lot now are \\"Warwick Avenue\\", \\"Delayed Devotion\\", \\"Syrup & Honey\\", and \\"Distant Dreamer\\". Definitly worth your money!

B003PIUBZS|5.0|This Series has everything, action, romance, violence, nudity and sex. I would not let  children watch these. It's only for adults, but it is awesome.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an amaxing writer and this book shows it ! I am a teen but i absolutly adore Sparks . I am trying to read all the books by him and so far i have already read two of them in a month and working on a third . if you are interested in romance books then Spaeks is the writer for you !
B002ZCY7TG|3.0|the terrorist tactics used by Jack kinda get annoying. He's supposed to be a good guy. He's fighting these terrorists when he IS a terrorist! Stand back Gestapo there's a new sheriff in town!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I thought that it was a great movie. I like sex and the city. I used to watch the shows every night when i went to bed.
1416550550|4.0|Great story, something original.  Very romantic, poetic and sad on occasion.  You could feel where the story was headed by the middle of the novel, but there were still some surprises thrown in until the very end.  Great read - highly recommend this book!
B004CURZFC|5.0|This is a visually beautiful film that tells of the \\"Hero's Journey\\" of a young owl who accidentally falls into the clutches of a group of power hungry owls who call themselves \\"The Pure Ones.\\" Further, it is the story of his escape and his meeting with the legendary \\"Guardians,\\" who are pledged to fight evil.  The climax of the story comes with the ending battle between the forces of light and dark, and the the film tells of the young owl's adventures in finding his way between good and evil.  The story tells of his search for adulthood in the process.<br /><br />This story does an excellent job of using the ideas and themes of Joseph Campbell in a way that is instructive and fun. The characterization is solid. The graphics are marvelous. There is humor and tenderness along the way.<br /><br />While this is a good family story, do not show this to very young children.  Some of the battle sequences will be too intense for them.  However, this is not a gory film.  Gore is only alluded to(but sometimes strongly) in the movie.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that this film has not received more attention.  It is a good story and the imagery is beautiful.  I wish I had been able to see it in 3-D. As some might say, that would have been \\"epic.\\"
B002BNKQDK|1.0|This had to be the most boring movie I had ever seen.  Jackie Earle Haley was good in it--but that is about it.  Over-blown, over-hyped and just over.
B001H1OUWU|1.0|If you are a neophyte in the realm of jazz please understand one thing, the \\"detractors\\" mentioned in these reviews are right. Fame is not the same as quality. Bitches Brew is famous crap, anyone not quite in the same league as Miles would have rightfully been run out of town. There were advantages to being Miles and this release is the evidence. As one character in the film \\"Christine\\" observed...\\"You can't polish a turd.\\" The elect few get it? No they don't, they just happen to be deaf, stoned, and easily led. Period.
B000002GXJ|5.0|This double CD set features a superb collection of Eagles touring version of their most popular songs. Well-performed, well-produced, and well worth a listen.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|So sad to have finished the last book in the series.  Wish there was a 5th book!  (And a 6th, and a 7th....)
1401323820|5.0|The best thing I could say to give a potential reader an idea of the entertainment value of this and its related title is that I HOPE that these two are only the beginning.  Using characters based on the popular television series, Castle, this \\"fictional\\" writer has given us another opportunity to enjoy the gentle competition and banter that has made the television program so popular.  So whoever is behind these books, keep 'em comin'!

B002ZG98J6|4.0|I loved this movie ever since it came out on the movie theather. I was exited that that amazon had it for 10 dollars. I bought it in \\"new\\" condition, when I received it it was scratched! It only played on my PS3.
1401324029|5.0|Obviously if you've seen Castle, the television series, you are at least aware of this and one other title to date by the fictional author and leading character.  There are no dissappointments to be had either.  The writing is clever, contemporary and a pleasure to read.  So don't hesitate to get an extra \\"dose\\" of one of the best pairings in contemporary entertainment.
1400032717|5.0|I generally don't finish books in just a few days, but I was totally engrossed in this book from the very first lines... I simply couldn't put it down! Intriguing. Funny. Quirky. Christopher is a beautiful character that you can't help but fall in love with. Brilliantly written.
B002E2M5IC|4.0|After the likes of \\"No Country For Old Men\\" and \\"Burn After Reading\\" which oddly didn't seem like Coen Brother films to me, this movie was a welcome return to the style of some of their earlier work such as \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\", \\"Fargo\\" and \\"Barton Fink\\", although I did find the ending to be more abrupt and less satisfying than these other films. Then again most of their movies only get better after repeated viewings.<br /><br />This won't be everybody's cup of tea.<br /><br />Still, if you like the Coen's previous style of dark comedies (and this one will rank amongst their darkest), their offbeat sense of humor, their meticulous attention to sets and details, the quirky characters nailed by some superb performaces, then \\"A Serious Man\\" should work for you.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|If you'd had told me a year ago that there was going to be a major cable network zombie t.v. show in this country, I'd have called you crazy.  If you'd asked me, I'd have said it was more unlikely than the dead ACTUALLY rising from their graves... but how wrong I'd be.<br /><br />The Walking Dead was THE sit down and shut up t.v. event of the year.  All naysayers were immediately silenced when the cinematic masterpiece of a pilot, 'Days Gone Bye' aired Halloween night.  The critics fawned, the audiences cheered, and the social networking machine became as ravenous as a rotted corpse shambling along looking for it's next meal.  Frank Darabont(director/screenwriter of Shawshank Redemption) brought to life, a nuanced yet brutal retelling of the first few issues of The Walking Dead comic series.(penned by Robert Kirkman, drawn by Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard) Somehow the comic series that has won the Eisner for best continuing comic series, was put on an even higher pedestal by the brilliant transition into television that not only shattered all previous cable t.v. records for viewership, but has already been nominated for dozens of awards including the Golden Globe for best t.v. series.(note: not best NEW series, BEST t.v. Series)<br /><br />Some people are complaining that the price on the Blu-Ray/DVD is too high for only 6 episodes, but I ask you this: how many television shows have EVER been this powerful in a mere 6 episode season or even a full first season for that matter?<br /><br />If you love blood and gore, this is the show for you.  If you love tense love triangles, this is the show for you.  If you love slow and nuanced drama, this is the show for you.  If you love fast paced violent action, this the show for you.  If you love gripping character development, this is the show for you.  If you love damn good television, this is the show for you.<br /><br />I got MY pre-order in.  How about you?
B002N5N4M6|5.0|If you hate missing an episode of a series after you're hooked, then you shouldn't watch the first one of these unless you're going to give up that night out to see every episode.  It's too good to even risk a glitch in the DVR.  Witty, smart, insane, and funny as anything you're likely to see ever, The Big Bang Theory is in a class by itself.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|This story will keep your heart racing to the end - a genuine page turner! Oliver Stone and company are wonderful characters (and yes, so is Finn)! I can't wait to read the next Camel Club book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What was once North America is now called Panem. A country divided into the Capitol and 13 districts. During the Dark Ages rebels from the 13 districts began a revolution against the capitol, but when they lose, their lives take on a whole new kind of torture. Residents of the districts are contained in fences and subject to strict rules from the captiol, but the worst part is the Hunger games. Each year all of the districts (except district 13 which was completely blown off the map in the war) of Panem gather for the Reaping, were one male and one female child between the ages of 12 and 18 are drawn to compete in a deadly game; a game were only one of the 24 children will come out alive.<br /><br />I started this book yesterday morning and finished it last night at 2. Thats how great it is! You seriously can't put the book down and when you do all you can think about is Katniss and Peeta and if they are going to survive. If you are having doubts about buying this book don't worry, it is well worth your money! :)<br /><br />Details:<br />+Stands alone but the series continues with Catching Fire and Mockingjay<br />+ My rating: PG-14. Contains gory violence that is not appropriate for young children. No curse words or sex.<br />+ If you like this book you might also like: Catching fire, Mockingjay, Fahrenheit 451, The time Machine, Brave New World, and the Uglies series.
1439133948|5.0|Ms. Bujold continues her Vokasigan Saga in her incredible style and uses her magic vocabulary to wrap the reader into the world of Miles. As always,she pulls you deep into the story and transports you to the scene. She makes it compelling to continue and in the end she earns your applause. Amazing is only the start.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|I guess I was too young, busy, etc. when this movie was presented....but, it is a REAL eye opener!  I was riveted from beginning to end and the extra DVD with original court testimony was very enlightening.  I would recommend this to EVERY American who cares about our future by examining our past.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Heartwarming story we all can relate too. Enjoyed watching with my kids. The added disks are a plus. Digital copy is great for mobile devices.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Im in love with DVD, Its a real kick butt workout. I do it all time. The levels are pretty diffcult but you'll get the results your looking for. I recommend this DVD to everyone!!
B001E45XT4|4.0|These headphones are comfortable after you break into them. The sound quality is OK for the price. The Bass is good, nothing amazing, but good. They can be a bit tight at first but they loosen up after a few uses.     4/5 stars. A really good buy when on sale.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|A classic collection from two awesome performers.  I love the music and enjoyed the little insights that they shared in this live performance.  I highly recommend to even the most casual James Taylor / Carole King fan.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My cousin once told me how much she loved this movie, and she kept repeating the dialogue \\"it's so flufffyyyy!!\\" from the movie. I thought this would be a perfect gift for her.     She was really delighted to receive this package as a Christmas present.    I like the fact that it has a DVD, a Blu-Ray DVD, and a digital version of the movie.    Great value for money!    A must watch movie, and a must-have in your collection of animation movies.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|The story was a little thin but for a classic flix it fit the bill with lots of good action scenes and good macho jokes. Willis and Arnold's scenes were short and less than great but the rest of the cast of action actors did well.
B002N3GD2Q|4.0|I had some of this material on the prior live albums, nice to have the complete shows.  Great music, shouldn't have messed with the original material and left John Sebastian's harmonica as it had been originally captured on tape.  And I can't figure why Doors archival releases are always more expensive than Grateful Dead archival releases (when you calculate price per disc).
0061997811|5.0|This book was full of details and fun \\"props\\" from the movie. My child loves it! If you enjoy the dragonology type books and you love Harry Potter you will not go wrong.
B000U7XUKK|5.0|I've been listening to Arcade Fire for a while now and I never, ever get tired of this album. For me it's one of my favourite albums of all time, possibly number 1.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I like this CD because I like Norah Jones. I prefer my other 4 cds though because I like her singing alone. And except for Ray, Herbie, Dolly , and Willie, I don't know who those people are.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|Rihanna has done it again with another great CD. I love LOUD! What's My Name is one of my favorites on the CD. The song with Nikki Manaj is pretty hot as well, even though I don't like Nikki Manaj at all. Definitely worth the money. Rihanna has grown and this album reflects that.
1589795474|4.0|\\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" is a good book to read if you are trying to become more aware of your spending habits and trying to accumulate more wealth.  I am a big fan of radio host, David Ramsey, and I decided to buy the book due to his recommendation.  The especially interesting parts of the book were the sections on what your net worth should be and how self-made millionaires spend their money.  Apparently, they live quite frugally and that's how they accumulate their wealth.  I recommend the book.  Some of the statistics got a bit boring, but overall, it's a helpful book.   Too bad I didn't read the book 10 or 20 years ago!
B003XL6EKS|4.0|I was little worried about this Solo Album by Brandon Flowers being a HUGE killers fan, but this still ended up being a great addition to my  collection.  He still Follows his Whole Las Vegas theme.  At first listen I thought it was a little slow.  Playing With Fire Had a slight country feel at times. Song 3  Hard Enough is the only Song I don't care for it. Do not really like the Duet. The CD took a few times Listening before I really appreciated it but the more I listened the more I loved it ! I would recommend this CD.  Brandon is an amazing Artist and Writer
B000ZELISO|3.0|Good movie, but I don't get all the fuss. This was a gift for my Wife, who is bonkers for Young Master Potter.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read this book last summer and it was on of the best books that I read all summer. I thought at first it started out slow. After a few chapters I really got into it and it was hard to put down. I recommend this book for anyone who is a dog lover or just wants to sit down and read a great book.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I was really reluctant to pick up a book like this, as it is completely written from the perspective of a 5 year old.  The language is even adjusted to sound like a child with poor speaking skills.  I was turned off by this at first, but I was intrigued with the subject matter because I remember the several dungeons that were uncovered in Austria a few years ago.  This book was definitely something I couldn't put down.  I bought it on a whim, and I am glad that I did because the book sucked me in and I was eager to read what happened next.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|So many of the recent animated films are formulaic, even if they are somewhat entertaining and the kids like them, and they've all got to see them because their friends have seen them, blah blah blah. I did not see this in the theater, as I was expecting it to be as dull as the others that have come out this year. It didn't help that it was (imho) over-advertised, and the image of the strange little yellow creatures, plus the title, made me suspect it was a reworked Mike Meyers show. Then I saw a few reviews that made me think there could be something more to it and it would be worth watching. I took a chance on it as a Christmas gift for my 8-year-old.  I was so pleasantly surprised and amused. The yellow characters (the \\"minions\\") have just the right amount of personality and coherence in their strange, chipmunk-inspired silly language, combined with impeccable timing and just the merest hint of the word you think they'll be saying (e.g., when they are sitting on the copying machine giggling together, they are saying something that sounds much funnier yet not QUITE recognizable as \\"Butt! hahahahahaha!\\") Gru, the \\"evil\\" guy, is a little Mike-Meyerish, and he's predictably \\"evil-looking,\\" with the predictable (for my generation, anyway) Boris-and-Natasha Russian accent--and, as with many CGI movies out these days, I had a vague sense that I'd seen these characters and scenes before (The Incredibles? Bolt? Who knows? They're all the same!) but the three kids actually seemed relatively real--at least the oldest, Morgan, who seems like a sensible, spunky kid. (With real-looking hair!)  They actually make use of the animation in this moview, instead of just doing things in animation that you could probably do in a non-animated film. And, while they do have the obligatory roller-coaster ride (to satisfy the crowd who paid the extra bucks to see it in 3D? Future Universal theme park tie-in?), it is blissfully short-lived. Not like a lot of current movies that waste 10 minutes flying around just because they can induce nausea in those prone to motion sickness, with no corresponding plot support, or any reason at all to be included in the 90-120 minutes of any movie (e.g., Jim Carrey's A Christmas Carol, or How to Train Your Dragon, Avatar, TRON). They have made a couple of new animation advances here, my favorite being the smoke, and the goofiness of Gru's life-long attempts to make something of himself. He's just not that good at his aim to be the world's worst villain. But he's nasty and self-centered, and he's got some really cool toys. With great smoke.<br /><br />The plot is not just a relief. It actually has substance and surprise, plus a few truly unexpected touches! It veers AWAY from the predictable at almost every turn, only heading back in to the predictable in order to poke fun of the standard plot lines, then twist them around again.  Steve Carrell and Russell Brandt, who can be irritatingly, stereotypically juvenile/dumb in most of their roles, are exquisitely cast as Gru and his inventor/manager. I felt like they'd finally found their medium! Gru is just cold enough so that the tug-at-your-heartstrings aspect is surprising and sweet rather than cheesy, and the kids just seem kind of normal, which is saying something for the CGI-generated cute-kid thing. Julie Andrews pulls off a believable and ironic Mom to Gru. My 8-yr-old was losing herself in giggles at some of the pranks, and I was torn between laughing out loud and marvelling at what a good job the filmmakers had done, and how much fun they must have had developing the plot and characters.  The characters and some fun plot points and minor details will make my obligatory 3rd or 4th viewing of it still enjoyable. Plus, the ending is -- dare I say it without sounding cliche -- heartwarming.  But still real and quirky and not too perfect or \\"awwww\\"-inspiring.  Just sweet enough to put an appreciative smile on any parent's face. It is ultimately about family. I swear.And the imperfections of family.<br /><br />This is NOT a scary movie for most kids, even most of the little ones, because the characters, such as the duplicative minions, the shark-mouthed dog, and even the actual shark, are more ironic than real. And ultimately nothing bad happens. Even the explosions are kind of harmless. I'm not exactly sure why this is rated PG, whereas the much more frightening \\"Toy Story 3\\" is rated G. (I confess I enjoyed that movie too, but it's cloyingly sweet and a calculated heartwarmer relative to this movie... plus, even though I love Tom Hanks and his acting abilities, his voice generally doesn't do it for me in any of his animated features. It's just annoying.)  Get this movie for your kids. Get it for you and say it's for your kids. Get it for you and plug your kids and their friends in so you can get something done around the house or shut them up on that long drive. Get it if you are obligated to watch movies over and over and over with your young kids. Get it if you are a sarcastic teenager. Or a nerd/geek. Or someone who likes to complain about nerd/geeks (Vector, who for some reason made me think of Steve Jobs, I don't know). Get it if you are tired of the same old, same old, and want to watch asomething a little more inventive.  Get it if you love Steve Carell & Russell Brandt, or if you hate them. And of course get it just to hear Julie Andrews. Get it if you don't mind a little potty humor (it's funny, not really vulgar). Get it if you have kids, and know how annoying they can be. Oh, and all the minor characters are fun as well.
0307272702|5.0|I pre-ordered Gary Taubes' new book \\"Why we get fat and what to do about it\\",  It arrived yesterday and I spent the day reading it.   Although I've always been a calorie restricting person,   rather than a \\"low-carb\\" person, I loved the book.     I've already read Good Calories Bad Calories several times,   and watched all of his University Lectures on YouTube,   and I've been thinking about these concepts for a few years.  I was worried that Taubes' new book would just seem like old info.   However, this was not the case.     He did a GREAT JOB.   His use of less detail made his concepts far more understandable   for someone like me, who is not a scientist or a medical professional.     I have a lifetime of low-calorie dieting history.    I am female, over 60, and 5'0\\" tall.    18 years ago weighing 271 lbs I had WLS.    Before my surgery I had lost more than 100 lbs twice   and regained it both times.  The year after surgery I lost from 271 to 160,   but as soon as my body could tolerate more carbs,   my weight began climbing again,   and I had to diet for the next 10+ years to maintain around 190 lbs.    6 years ago, I began using a computer food-journal to record all my food,   and I was successful at a low-calorie diet, losing from 190 to 115 lbs.  I have been maintaining close to that weight for the past 5 years  by continuing to restrict calories.    During the past 2 years I've had to average around 1050 calories to maintain my current weight,   and I've consistently been physically hungry much of the time now for more than 6 years.    Thanks to Taubes, I now realize that by restricting calories,    I also unintentionally restricted carbs.  Could it be that each time I've lost weight in my lifetime it was due to carb restriction?  Could it be that my maintenance difficulties have been due to carb return?  Is it possible that I could go low-carb and maintain my current weight without being so hungry?  This year, I plan to do my own personal Experiment-of-Oneto find out.    I found the book highly motivating,   and I recommend it to every open-minded person

030746363X|3.0|I've read a lot of the book and also read a lot of the reviews on here.  I am going to admit that I was very confused by this book.  I have read a lot of health, diet and exercise books and a lot of chapters in this book did not make sense to me.  I think a \\"binge day\\" once a week is a good idea, but how long are you supposed to be on this diet?  It doesn't seem sustainable to me.  The first few chapters claimed how easy it is to follow and stay on, but I don't agree.  He's cutting out way to much.  I agree that white foods are not that great for you, but what about whole grains?  Not sure if I feel that everything I have ever learned has been contradicted or if he is actually on to something.

B001VEHZZ2|4.0|Mohsin Hamid's interesting novella \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" is written in the same dramatic monologue style as Albert Camus' [[ASIN:0679720227 The Fall]] and Dostoevsky's [[ASIN:1936594676 Notes from the Underground]]. In this sense the reader gets an intimate image of the tortured portrait that is Changez's transformation from an American student and businessman into a frustrated and insecure enemy of America.<br /><br />This book is essentially a metaphor. As one reviewer pointed out before, the names of the important characters represent key elements of the story: if we drop the \\"z\\" off of the protagonist's name we get \\"change\\"; if we add the prefix \\"am\\" to Erica's name we get \\"America\\"; and if we add a \\"t\\" to the end of Chris's name we get \\"Christ.\\" Changez is a fresh graduate of Princeton, who enters the work force as a member of an elite New York City business firm whose job it is to value companies and determine where to trim fat (lay off unnecessary workers) for high-paying clients. (Of course, he later realizes that he has become, with his profession, part of what he sees as the problem.)<br /><br />After September 11 Changez's world begins to be transformed. He experiences anti-Arab sentiment (although he himself is not Arabic, but rather Pakistani); he becomes disillusioned with the way the United States is carrying on the War on Terror in his native home's next door neighbor Afghanistan; and worst of all, his girlfriend Erica relapses into a perpetual melancholy over her dead love, Chris.<br /><br /> Changez reflects on how he had \\"always thought of America as a nation that looked forward; for the first time I was struck by its determination to look back. Living in New York was suddenly like living in a film about the Second World War; I, as a foreigner, found myself staring out at a set that ought to be viewed not in Technicolor but in grainy black in white. What your fellow countrymen longed for was unclear to me--a time of unquestioned dominance? of safety? of moral certainty? I did not know--but that they were scrambling to don the costumes of another era was apparent.\\"<br /><br />Thus the voice that Hamid gives Changez is that of an estranged dissenter to the American response to the great upheaval of 9/11. His girlfriend Erica's relapse into a memory-induced depression is a metaphor for this response: America found itself in an uncomfortable position where its easiest response was to look backwards to fundamentals; fundamentals that were, perhaps, irrelevant and obsolete. In sum, Hamid is a talented writer whose book is written with a powerful voice, and is short and entertaining enough to hold the reader's attention throughout this tale of a reluctant fundamentalist.ertainty?

B00078XGRO|5.0|\\"Star Trek - First Contact\\" is one of the best Trek films ever. I saw this in theatres back in '96. I love the cast of the original Star Trek (Kirk, Spock, etc) but for some reason, was never that invested in TNG series when it was on TV. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the pacing, the edginess, the overall action of this film, and Picard, Data, and the rest of the cast of characters grew on me (perhaps not enough to actually make me go back and discover TNG, per se, but it is fun.<br /><br />The premise has to do with the Borg, a race of malevolent cybernetic drones who wish to collect and turn other lifeforms in the universe into part of their own collective. Apparently, Capt. Picard was assimilated into them at one point. The Borg Queen, very well played with a creepy vibe by Alice Krige, wants to travel back to the 21st Century and infiltrate the human race and stop the very first contact recorded between humans and extraterrestials, to try to undermine the inevitable change in human history.<br /><br />James Cromwell gives a great performance as Zefram Cochrane, the scientist who invented Warp Drive, which enabled people to create ships to venture into deep space and beyond. He portrays him as a drunken, broken man, very flip and loose with a one-liner who at first has a hard time being convinced that hes destined to be a great, revered man due to his discovery.<br /><br />The script moves at a breakneck pace, which the best Trek films do, and Jonathan Frakes' direction is flawless; he knows how to pace and gives us a cool sci-fi story with interesting heroes and villians we want to see. The Wrath of Khan definitely had this exact quality. The film's action is muscular and it help represents the best of Trek's storytelling qualities.<br /><br />First Contact is excellent.
0553805371|1.0|This book offers new answers to the ultimate questions of life from a scientific viewpoint while taking pot shots at `philosophy' which it declares dead as well as taking the usual swipe at the Catholic Church for its disciplining of Galileo.    Apart from the hubris expressed by its authors it fails to clearly explain the much touted `M-Theory' which should be properly categorised as a hypothesis rather than theory.    There are such breathtaking contradictions in this book and it is so poorly put together as an argument that I could not believe that Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow actually allowed their names to appear as the authors.    The authors hold that the Catholic Church was wrong to discipline Galileo for his promulgation of the Copernican model and of his own hypothesis that tides were caused by the rotation of the earth. The authors also hold that the Catholic Church apologised for this disciplining in 1992. As far as I am aware, the report by the Curia to Pope John Paul II upheld the correctness of the disciplining of Galileo.    The reason that the Catholic Church disciplined Galileo was because he was promulgating a hypothesis that was controversial and challenged Church teaching at that time and which was based on long established scientific principles (the Ptolemaic model which was accurate in its predictions of the positions of planets), as well as biblical tradition.    The Catholic Church was not averse to changing its position on the nature of the solar system, but as the then pope Urban VIII (who was a good friend and supporter of Galileo), warned him that if a new truth was to replace the existing teaching, it had to have clear proof of its superiority to the old teaching.    The Copernican model was flawed because Copernicus assumed a perfect circle as the orbit of the planets. His model was worse at predicting the position of planets than the existing accepted Ptolemaic model and in addition, Galileo's hypothesis claiming that tides were caused by the rotation of the earth, was derisory.    His arguments were torn to shreds by the inquisitors at his trial and he was reduced to demanding that the Catholic Church believe that his view was correct even if he could not prove it, a strange position for a scientist to be in.    Galileo was wrong. If he tried today to argue similarly today before a panel of his peers, he would be judged by his peers today to be wrong. He was arrogant and self-righteous, convinced in his superiority of knowledge and demanded that he be acknowledged as correct even when his hypotheses were demonstrably in error.    It is interesting to note that at the same time Galileo was demanding that the Catholic Church accept his position even if he could not scientifically prove it, there was another scientist by the name of Johannes Kepler, who after much studying with Tycho Brahe in Prague as well as having access to Brahe's mass of meticulously recorded data, came to the conclusion that the solar system was heliocentric and that the orbits of planets around the sun were to varying degrees elliptical. This was the answer. His model was elegant and accurate. No need for the equants and retrograde motions and all the complexities of the Ptolemaic system.    Kepler also had a marvellous hypothesis for the tides on earth. His observations showed that they were caused by the moon circling the earth.    The upshot is that Galileo knew of Kepler's work but rejected it out-of-hand as the work of a crackpot and alchemist. This was no doubt because of the fact that Kepler worked with Brahe in the court of Rudolf II Hapsburg in Prague, a court renowned for its unorthodox scientific methods.    Kepler retired to Regensburg in Bavaria and published his findings as a hypothesis. The work was circulated amongst Protestant and Catholic circles, thoroughly investigated and stood the test of empirical robustness and was accepted by the Catholic Church as a better explanation of our universe than Ptolemy's. No charges of heresy were laid at Kepler's door. He was not hauled before Inquistions to defend himself because he went about it the right way.    In a round about fashion, I see Messrs. Hawking and Mlodinow doing exactly what Galileo did all those centuries ago. They are pushing a version of reality based around string hypothesis and M or Brane hypothesis which after nearly 40 years of intensive work, are no closer to an answer and instead are becoming more and more grotesquely complicated while having to use an inordinate number of constants in their equations to stop their results going to infinity. Their hypotheses are as convoluted as the Ptolemaic model that they snigger at.    The physicist Lee Smolin, in his excellent book `The Trouble with Physics' documents the cul-de-sac that the boosters of String Hypotheses have led us into. Yet more and more money is being poured into this research by the zealots who are convinced that the answer is just around the corner and all it needs is just a little more. Anyone standing back to question this zealotry is condemned as a `denialist' or `a loser'.    To me, Messrs. Hawking and Mlodinow more and more resemble those alchemists in the court of Rudolf II, who inveigled more and more treasure out of Rudolf II with the promise that they were on the verge of cracking the transmutation of base metals into precious metals. Their proposition that gravity is enough to start new universes without even stopping to consider how gravity came into existence beggars the imagination. Maybe that they believe that like Galileo they have superior minds which understand these things and we lesser minds do not have to concern ourselves about these questions. All we have to do is just accept that what they say is truth! Shades of Galileo! Their book is a total disappointment.    I just hope that there is modern day Johannes Kepler busily working away out there, who will lead us out of this cul-de-sac and back onto the right path.

B001GKJ2E8|2.0|My brother and I saw this movie upon it's release in Billings MT. We thaught that if all else failed, at least Angie Jolie is sexy and the other kid has been good in films, so what the heck. Well all did fail, what a dud! To quote my brother upon leaving the theater, \\"It was the coolest and stupidest movie of the summer!\\" Yep that about sums it up.
038572179X|5.0|I think anyone who can't appreciate this book just doesn't get it. It is so interpretable and inspiring. There is so much to learn about life and humanity from his characters. His prose is stunning; no one writes like Ian McEwan. The plot gives us an insight into the human psyche in a way that no one else quite delivers. This novel proves that Ian McEwan is the epitome of what a good writer must be- insight, understanding, good pacing, wonderful writing, and a heart-breaking ending. One of the best books I have ever read. (The movie doesn't do it justice).
B003ZK58WM|4.0|After reading \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World Without End\\" I anxiously awaited this book.  As my title suggests, it was good but not great.  I appreciate the character and plot developments.  Reading about World War I backdrop events held my interest.  With all that said, I still didn't find the book riveting.  I put it down a number of times and didn't come back to it for days - unlike the previous books where I couldn't put them down.  It was good, but not great.

1878424505|2.0|Concept is good. I've read alot of other books about the same concept. But the author in this book kept repeating over and over and over the same thing which drove me nuts. I couldnt finish the book.

030746363X|5.0|Due to the slew of recent comments I thought I would do my first review. 1st there are people claiming this book has let them down. I question that because for me it was the total opposite. Tim has stated in his book that you should continue to test and that is the truth. Some of these people are looking for the first comma placed on the wrong side of the page to claim it is bogus. Take it from me I have struggled with weight and I had all the so called right information! I wasn't a person who didn't care about my weight but these trainers and fitness companies want to use you as a life line as Tim so eloquently described in the book. They want you to think you need their product because you=$ every single month for their bottom line.    People say the calorie method Tim describes is contradictory how? I am not into health and could see a mile away he was explaining if you took the same people and they were eating different things with the same calorie intake it would be different scenarios. It is logical sense, and if you eat foods that give your body the best nutrients you could eat them no matter the calorie intake.     Tim gives you the resources that others won't. The premise of the four hour body is to equip you to make better choices at health not to give you an end all solution as some of these reviewers have claimed they should have gotten. These are probably the same people who don't finish programs, or practically anything in their life. Sorry to be so harsh but it the blatant truth.     If you want to be equipped on what is going into your body and why it is going there read this book. If you are a fitness buff that wants to find some revolutionary thing out of fairy dust you won't find it.    But don't discourage people who have struggled for years and don't want a new program, they want a life program. They are tired of paying for personal trainers, taking pills for God knows what reason, and just being taught what to do. It is all for profit and the same people that are commenting about being disappointing are the same people charging thousands of dollars to show them what Tim can show you for a measly $13 bucks.     Then again if you look at the history when the Four hour work week came out everybody was stating it was impossible and a waste of money. Now those same people are on the Four Hour work week bandwagon.    Do your own research and let the book change your life to be equipped for the rest of your life!    -JB

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing Turbo Jam for over a year, and was starting to get bored. I delved into p90x with a friend, and that seemed good, but I decided to try this one for $9 before spending several times that on p90x. WOW, this is a serious workout. I am just as sore after doing this as after p90x. I thought I was in pretty good shape, but apparently not! I love how simple and easy the exercises are, and how all you need are handweights. GREAT DVD! I will definitly buy more Jillian Michaels once I get bored of this one!

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|[[ASIN:B000Y5JFNY The Sound of Music (Limited Edition Collector's Set) [Blu-ray/DVD Combo]]]This is the most beautiful restoration of a film that I have ever seen, and anyone who loves the sound of music needs to purchase this for their collection. I started loving the SOM when I was in high school and by the time my family had bought their first Betamax I knew I had to own it. It was one of the first movies I bought from Columbia house on Beta. Then on Laserdisc. Then the 30th Anniversary Laserdisc box set. Then on Dvd. But this tops them all, and I swear it is such a crisp & clean transfer you could almost reach out and touch the green grass one blade at a time.    BUY IT! You won't be sorry!
B001U6YI92|2.0|I was pretty surprised to find out there is no option to watch the original theatrical release! Shocking actually. To each his own and if you like the new scenes you will like this version but the added scenes do nothing for me and the voices are not the same (Lee Van Cleef's part is dubbed by somebody else). I would like to continue to watch the original. Also, the new soundtrack is noticeably different having been modified with new special effects to create the 5.1 Dolby. Again there is no option to play the original soundtrack! Just plain STUPID! I'll go back to watching my DVD! I consider this a waste of money.

B001TW68P4|5.0|This cd I accidentally fell into because for years I was wanting the Turtles Greatest Hits that was unavailable (cover had them lying in a street); now that they were able to get their just dues years later and creative control and rights to their own music, they release this cd which is everything any Turtles fan could want and in exceptional sound and with a very fitting title indeed.<br /><br />It is funny, I owned the Turtles' history VHS some years back which was an anthology of sorts, and in it, they referred to the many ongoing legal problems from their managers who screwed them over, etc and now, this cd is long overdue and I am glad they finally got control of their tunes.<br /><br />This is a problem with lawyers and the music industry ingeneral for years; so many good groups were taken advantage of by lawyer managers and the like, stealing their royalties and controlling their songs and not just the Turtles, but other good bands like John Fogerty of CCR, Badfinger, The Vogues, to name a few which tricky legal maneuvers were done to abuse the musicians and steal their song lists (and $millions in royalties) and I am glad to see this Turtles cd released and THEM finally exonerated after so many years.
B000002V1D|5.0|I was a fan of DD in the 80's.  The 80's were my early twenties, and I loved the freshness and innovation of their music then.  Life got busy and I forgot about DD for the most part until I saw a \\"Behind the Music\\" special on them a couple of weeks ago on VH1.  This CD was mentioned on that show, and after reading many of the rave reviews, I decided to purchase it along with a Stevie Wonder greatest hits CD, and a Tears for Fears CD.  I left the DD CD for last.  I was really afraid of what it was going to sound like.  How could it match Rio, Save a Prayer, and the like of the 80's?  When I finally listened to the CD, my first reaction was, \\"Wow!\\"  I played the CD on random, so it didn't go in order, and I enjoyed each track more than the previous one.  I would love to purchase another CD of theirs, if it is of the quality of this one.  I thoroughly enjoy this CD and would recommend it to anybody.  Even my husband, who has always been an anti-80's music person, liked what he heard of this CD when he was in the car with me.  My husband has always been especially vocal about hating DD, so he too was surprised by the fact that he liked what he heard of this CD.  If you're a fan of DD's music from the 80's, you'll love this CD...not because it sounds like DD of the 80's, but rather, because it's a great set of music in its own right.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|Bottom-Line:  \\"Tron Legacy\\" was an alright movie, but I would not see it again nor highly recommend it.<br /><br />Trends in movie making come and go, and I had hoped that 3-D had seen its time, but its back, but that's in line with the \\"everything old is new again\\" theme currently sweeping through Hollywood studios.  And that brings us to \\"Tron Legacy\\" in 3-D.  Having experienced movie is 3-D in the `70's I would just assume skip it now, and as it happens I did not intend to see Tron Legacy 3-D, but it's the only version the local theater had, so...<br /><br />Story-Line<br /><br />Directed by new-comer Joseph Kosinski, Tron Legacy 3-D picks up where the original Tron (1982) supposedly left off.  The movie opens on Kevin Flynn portrayed by Jeff Bridges (True Grit, Crazy Heart, Iron Man) talking to his young son Sam Flynn about Tron.  Fade to black and Daddy Flynn disappears, light come up and Sam Flynn portrayed by a very bland Garrett Hedlund (Four Brothers, Troy, Eragon) is all grown up and has shunned the gaming company his father started choosing to live the life of techno-recluse on a fast motorcycle.<br /><br />However, after Sam engages in a bit of corporate sabotage, he is sought out by his father's right hand man Alan Brady, portrayed by Bruce Boxleitner (Tron, Babylon 5, Scarecrow & Mrs. King) who gives him to keys to his father's old video game store.  Same reluctantly goes of course, and discovers his father's old workshop with equipment still humming away.  A few keyboard strokes later and Sam is in the Tron universe and quickly identified as a \\"player.\\"<br /><br />The games begins naturally and Sam bests all comers except Tron and is rescued by Quorra portrayed by and equally bland Olivia Wilde (The O.C., Alpha Dog, House M.D.), who just happens to work and live with Sam's father, who we discover is also stuck in the game and doing battle with his (evil) clone.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is in the middle of a renaissance of sorts; an aging American actor popping up in all sorts of high budget, high profile movies and turning in critically acclaimed performances.  \\"Tron Legacy 3-D\\" will not win him any awards, or acclaim.  But, then I doubt the makers of this B-movie thought \\"Tron Legacy\\" was anything than what it is, a fair good live-action movie, which is thin on story and acting.<br /><br />I do not like 3-D.  Cool at first, the effect quickly lost its luster as \\"Tron Legacy\\" progressed.  Watching a film in 3-D is like watching it through muddy water, the movie loses its sharpness and vibrancy; i.e. the colors are muted and take the 3-D glasses off and the movie becomes out of focus!  I do not like 3-D and I will avoid all movies in 3-D in the future.  To be fair, some of the effects in 3-D were cool, but there were not enough of them to sit through this rather dark movie fiddling with over-sized plastic glasses.  I would end by saying that 3-D is for children, not adults, who should take the movie-going experience seriously.<br /><br />My dislike of 3-D aside, \\"Tron Legacy\\" was an alright movie, but I would not see it again nor highly recommend it.  The action sequences were well done, but there were slow spots where frankly I had to fight to stay awake.  And this says a lot about the lack of a compelling story-line outside the action.  There is nothing new in \\"Tron Legacy\\"; we have been down this rabbit-hole before; it is a tried and true formula without much more to say.<br /><br />I wanted to like \\"Tron Legacy\\", but really after one gets past the cool form fitting neon-glow costumes, whizzing Frisbee/disc weapons, seriously cool vehicles and cyberspace milieu, there isn't much to get excited about.  Though I was only a passing fan of the original movie I was excited about the reboot, attracted by the promise of gee-wiz CGI special effects.  On that score the movie delivered, but in the end the story made little sense, and unless we are in the middle of non-stop action--we're not here--the store should be compelling enough to keep me awake!p me awake!

B00005JLF5|5.0|Bottom-Line: Well acted, \\"ST: DS9 ~The Complete First Season\\" is just the beginning of my journey into what might prove to be one of the darkest chapters in Federation history.<br /><br />The Star Trek franchise has been alive for over forty-five years and through all of the various incarnations: Star Trek (The Original Series), Star Trek The Next Generation, Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Star Trek Voyager, Star Trek: Enterprise, as well as nine motion pictures, I have been an eager and loyal fan.<br /><br />When \\"Star Trek Deep Space Nine (ST: DS9)\\" hit the airways in 1993 I was stationed with the U.S. Navy in Hawaii.  I was able to see a few episodes, principally in the first season, but overall I missed most of the 7-season run of \\"ST: DS9.\\"  So when I found all seven seasons of the series on Amazon.com, I plotted a course and picked up \\"The Complete First Season.\\"<br /><br />The Story-Line<br /><br />\\"ST: DS9 ~The Complete First Season\\" is entrenched in Gene Roddenberry's now multifaceted Star Trek universe.  The series was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller and produced by Paramount Television the owners of the Star Trek franchise.<br /><br />A spin-off of Star Trek: The Next Generation, \\"ST: DS9 ~The Complete First Season\\" opens as the Federation takes over the operations of the Cardassian space station Terok Nor in deep space.  The station orbits the planet of Bajor.  After the Bajoran people liberate themselves after a long brutal occupation by the Cardassians, the Provincial Government invites the United Federation of Planets in to command the station alongside Bajorans.  The Federation renames the station Deep Space Nine.<br /><br />The series stars Avery Brooks (Spenser For Hire, A Man Called Hawk, American History X) as Commander Benjamin Sisko, the franchise's first Black commanding officer.  He is joined by the following series regulars:<br /><br />o Security Officer Odo (Rene Auberjonois ~ Benson, The Pirates of Dark Water, The Patriot);<br />o First Officer Major Kira (Nana Visitor ~ Ryan's Hope, Dark Angel, Friday the 13th);<br />o Lt. Doctor Bashir (Alexander Siddig ~ Syriana, 24, The Last Legion),<br />o Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell ~ Paper Dolls, Deep Core, Becker);<br />o Quark (Armin Shimerman ~ Beauty and the Beast, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Boston Legal);<br />o Operations Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney ~ Last of the Mohicans, Star Trek The Next Generation, Clean Break), and;<br />o Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton) Commander Sisko's son.<br /><br />Predictably there are also several recurring Cardassian characters in DS9, including the former head of the station Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo ~ Hill Street Blues, Star Trek: The Next Generation), the primary villain of the series.  Gul Dukat is a complex Cardassian and he undergoes several transformations before ultimately becoming profoundly evil and by the show's conclusion, he has morphed into Sisko's archenemy.<br /><br />Another equally complex character is Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson ~ Ryan's Hope) the only Cardassian to stay on the station after his fellows pull out.  He is suspected of being an agent of the dreaded Obsidian Order, the Cardassian secret police however; he insists that he is but a humble tailor.  Garak's wide-ranging skills and contacts within the Cardassian Empire prove invaluable in several episodes, and he becomes a crucial figure in the upcoming war with the Dominion in later seasons.<br /><br />ST: DS9 ~The Complete First Season deals with the ramp up of the space station and the discovery of the artificial wormhole by Commander Sisko and Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax.  The (stable) wormhole offers passage to the Gamma Quadrant a sector of the galaxy heretofore unexplored.  As a result of the discovery DS9 is moved out of Bajor orbit and closer to the wormhole in order to stake a claim to it.  The wormhole quickly becomes a center for exploration, interstellar trade, political maneuvering, between the Federation, the CardassianFederation, and Bajor.<br /><br />The Bajorans worship the highly evolved entities they call Prophets.  That (religious) worship generates issues between the Federation and the Bajoran population.  The complicate matters Sisko is named Emissary of the Prophets.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />\\"ST: DS9 ~The Complete First Season\\" is one of the best Star Trek spin-off's to date.  Each episode is well written and this first season takes it time introducing us to the characters that in time will become one of the strongest in the Federation universe.<br /><br />In the \\"ST: DS9\\" universe a large cross-section of alien creatures comes through the station, in fact every episode introduces us to a new race, most of which come through the wormhole.<br /><br />Though there are light moments in \\"ST: DS9 ~The Complete First Season\\" most of the episode explore dark material that more than other Trek series explore contemporary issues in American society at the time, including the separation of Church and State, the role of religion in the classroom, genocide, racism, bigotry, and terrorism.<br /><br />Well acted, \\"ST: DS9 ~The Complete First Season\\" is just the beginning of my journey into what might prove to be one of the darkest chapters in Federation history; the Borg are still a threat, and there is an uneasy peace between Cardassia and the Federation, and there is still a feeling of general unrest in the galaxy.

B003I55BIA|5.0|This book was very good. I got the book only two days ago and aleady finished it. It kept me on edge the entire time! It had romance, forbidden love, danger, and a few really hot and intimate scenes. This book appeals to teens with all different tastes. If you are like i was, unsure whether it would be worth reading, GET IT! You wont regret it. I do recommend teens only over the age of 15 read it though since there is quite a bit of foul language used to renforce the feeling of the lifestyle present in the book.  Hope this helped!
B001FB55H6|4.0|Bottom-Line: \\"Watchmen\\" is one of those movies you really have to see at least twice to get the full effect.<br /><br />Ah, Comic Books, they are the province of fertile imaginations and seriously good artwork.  I didn't really cotton to the $.75 color rags growing up; I got into them after I was stationed overseas and longed for a patch of home.  My favorites were those from Marvel Comics: Xmen, Wolverine, The Mighty Thor, and Spiderman.  DC Comics were never that exciting for me, Superman aside of course.  So I was never fan of The Watchmen, though I have heard of the comic series.<br /><br />But, comics made into movies, well no matter who inked the paper, it's time to watch.  Some like the original Superman (1978) were instant classics, while others like The Punisher (2004), and Punisher: War Zone (2008) were, well, instant stinkers.  \\"Watchmen\\" (2009), while not as fun to watch as Superman is certainly darker and every bit as engaging and entertaining.<br /><br />Story-Line<br /><br />Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Dawn of the Dead), \\"Watchmen\\" is based on a 12-issue limited series comic book created by writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins, and published by DC Comics  in 1986 -1987.<br /><br />The basic premise: someone is killing some of the ex-members of the superhero group The Watchmen formed before World War II.  They include Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino ~ Snake Eyes, Spin City, Chicago Hope), Edward Blake/The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan ~ Supernatural, P.S. I Love You, Grey's Anatomy), Hollis Mason/Night Owl (Stephen McHattie ~ Beauty and the Beast, Cold Squad, 2012).<br /><br />Now it's left up to the new members of the recently disbanded Watchmen to find out who has it out for the good guy and why.  The new members include Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman ~ The Comeback, 27 Dresses, Couples Retreat), Dan Drieberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson ~ Angels in America, Little Children, Lakeview Terrace), Walter Kovacs/Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley ~ Breaking Way, Little Children), and Dr. Manhattan/Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup ~ Waking the Dead, Almost Famous, The Good Shepherd).<br /><br />The new team has been disbanded by order of President Nixon(?), who in this alternative universe has been elected to office five times!  Nonetheless, before the end of the movie three of the four Watchmen band together to battle Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode ~ Match Point, The Lookout), the \\"smartest (and fastest) man in the world,\\" as he hatches a sinister plot to save mankind from itself.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />Watchmen is thankfully rated \\"R\\" so you know the movie means business and will truly entertain in a manner befitting such a dark piece of work.  Director Zack Snyder brings to the movie that same sort of dark noir setting that made 300 (2006) such a critical success, complete with slow motion action sequences that really bring the viewer into the film.  I loved it in 300, and I love it here on \\"Watchmen\\"<br /><br />From where I sitting (and writing) there is nothing wrong with an occasional movie that shocks the senses, an adult movie with truckloads of gore, sessions and sessions worth of angst, superhero sex, unschooled, nails-on-a-blackboard narration, seriously fun fight scenes, and enough back-story to fill in even the most casual comic-book reader.  \\"Watchmen\\" delivers all of this and quite a bit more.<br /><br />Slow in places, especially at the beginning, the 251 minutes movie nonetheless never fails to entertain, and do in spades once the action really ramps up.  \\"Watchmen\\" does an excellent job creating the dark, complex, alternate reality which unfolds like a bad nightmare, but don't shy away or you'll miss the rewards that come from a well-crafted adult-themed movie.  And I don't mean adult as in XXX, but a serious thinking man--and woman'--movie where the kiddies can be safely excluded.<br /><br />But \\"Watchmen\\" isn't all darkness and grim faced, there is fun afoot as well in the guise of Pat Buchanan and Eleanor Clift arguing nuclear war on PBS's The McLaughlin Report.  Richard Nixon and his cabinet make frequent, if not hilarious appearances as larger than life bumbling idiots lazily taking the country to the brink of nuclear war.<br /><br />Also look for Ted Koppel, JFK, Lee Iacocca and others to make cameos in this alternative landscape, wherein America won the Vietnam War (thanks to Dr. Manhattan), and the American Dream is a nightmare un vapid unfulfilled promises and the country is on the brink of self-destruction.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" is one of those movies you really have to see at least twice to get the full effect and to soak in little things happing in the scenes you may have missed first time through.  So, I'll be watching the move again thanks to my trusty DVR.

0061544493|5.0|I picked up this book several times before actually purchasing, but I'm glad I eventually did buy it. I am always looking for fashion, hair and makeup tips, and this did not disappoint! It also completely changed my idea of Victoria Beckham. I assumed she would include only very expensive brands, focusing on only \\"skinny\\" styles, etc. but she includes everyone and every body and style and type. There was one section where she was talking about how important it is to buy clothes that fit, and said something like, \\"if you can't bear to buy a size 14, tear the tag out, but don't buy a size 12.\\" I couldn't believe she even KNEW that size 14 existed, but she proved to be much more down-to-earth than I expected. I really don't agree with other reviews that say she is just self promoting. I didn't get that at all. Yes, she talks somewhat about her own brand, and also speaks a lot from personal experince, but how else would she have formed her opinion and give advice? Anyway, I really liked this,Victoria is funny and fun, and the book is accessible to everyone. I don't think you will be disappointed.

B002NOAF9W|3.0|In 1969 I was fortunate to see the Stones. To this day it remains the best concert I've ever seen. Then it was all about the music, no props, no set, just pure hard driving Rock N Roll...yes the Stones are/was the greatest Rock N Roll Band.. Most will agree that the pinnacle of the Stones was during the the Mick Taylor years. I waited a year to purchased this re-issue and new released material. I had read the reviews, and I have to agree I was disappointed. This could have been so much more. To the point if you already have Get Yer Yas Yas...then unless your an avid collector... I wouldn't waste your money. The added bonuses here are the BB King (superb!!!)and Ike and Tina. The DVD is a terrible disappointment and could have really made this set outstanding. There should have been more video (How about releasing the entire set?) What is there is some backstage shots (sans audio. In an attempt to fill the video...there are several slow motion shots of Mick strutting...not sure I'll watch the DVD again. If you what to hear an outstanding live performance of the Mick Taylors years, go to Wolfgang's Vault and check out the Stones 1973 Brussels concert...Wow this is the Stones at their best. Sadly over the yeras the Stones have been glorifed Vegas style stadium act...how fortunate I was to see the 1969 tour...one of the best in history.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have had this amp for about a month and it works very well.  It helps the sound of earbuds and especially earphones.  I have Sony MDR V6 headphones and it gives you more power range above that of an MP3 player.  Check out my photo under the item description where you will see it mounted to the armband slits of a silicone skin over  my Sansa Fuze.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|We got this game for Christmas and have played it several times already!  It is a great game and a lot of fun for us and our two boys, who are 12 & 15. However, as many others have mentioned, the manufacturer would do much to improve the quality and value of this game by making the \\"board\\" out of a thicker cardboard or a thin wood.  We are having a time keeping it all together!  There is a moderate amount to learn, but it is not overwhelming.  You can watch the on-line instructions to get an overview.  After the first game, everyone catches on quickly.
B0042816YK|5.0|Being Julia fans we went to the movies to see Eat Pray Love and although the movie was up too our expectations, we had trouble with the dialogue due to our deafness.    A search of Amazon.com came up with a just released version that has sub titles so I ordered a copy and it arrived within a week, in time for my partners birthday.    Being able too enjoy this movie at our own leisure has made the experience far more enjoyable than the first viewing at the cinema.
0374158460|1.0|I waded through several hours of reading this book before I finally gave up in disgust. People sometimes justify depressing and rather debased views of humanity by stating it's a part of reality. If I need to know about this aspect of humanity, I would prefer to read scholarly research rather than sordid fictionalized details of the depths to which people can descend. I do not recommend this book.
B00019074O|2.0|I've seen this movie around for years, and never got around to watching it.  Its persistence made me wonder if it had the originality and comedy of, say, [[ASIN:B0000A02TZ National Lampoon's Animal House]], [[ASIN:B000B5XOWA Airplane!]], or [[ASIN:B003CRM6PA Caddyshack]].<br /><br />It doesn't.  'Nuff said.
B003FSTN52|4.0|What started off seeming like a feminist cliche, developed into a very compelling, layered and well-rounded story.  If you can get past the shows slightly rocky beginning, great rewards lie ahead!  High praise for \\"The Good Wife\\" is fully merited, and I'd give the show 5 stars if I hadn't foolishly written my original interview after having only watched the first 5 episodes (with which I was not greatly impressed). Not long after that however I did start becoming intrigued by the show.  The actors suddenly \\"became\\" the characters, the plot thickened very effectively and the story suddenly began to show a great deal of depth and breadth - in effect, it found its groove (I remember similar experience with \\"The Wire\\" which also started off weakly - though perhaps had fewer weak initial shows).      In every episode of \\"The Good Wife\\" you get both an individual case for the episode along with the continuing story saga of Alicia and her husband (and family).  While I wasn't convinced by the saga part of the story initially (not to mention some of the episode cases), the quality of both the episode cases AND the family saga started to become a lot more interesting as the season evolves, as if the show had gotten new writers or as if the old ones had started giving their audiences more credit.  The saga element while weak in the beginning starts gaining prominence as the show continues and the characters round out into more interesting individuals as the stories themselves become better.    I'd fully recommend \\"The Good Wife\\" to anyone who likes courtroom drama and a continuing cliffhanger saga laced with politics, law, the ironies of destiny and forbidden love! Having finished the first season at this point I am looking forward to season 2.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|Works very well. Although there is a learning curve to it. It is not 1:1 as PC gaming simply because this device emulates a PS3 controller and takes input from 2 completely different devices. It's heavily recommended to get a mouse that can adjust it's DPI on the fly such as the Logitech G500 (which I also purchased at the same time from Amazon). It took me a few days to get all the settings dialed in just right between the device, mouse, and in-game, and even then it still takes getting used to for someone who's played FPS on the PC for years. After a few weeks with it I couldn't go back to using the classic controller. Very happy with it. As it is still a very new product only a few months old it has room for improvement but just from firmware v.1 and now on to v.2 it has already improved greatly with many added features. The support in the forums is also amazing, the community really comes together to help each other hash out any issues and share what setups work for them, I may have returned it after the first few days if I wasn't able to get help from there. I've recommended it to everyone I play with.
B0029ATTAQ|4.0|This version of the movie follows as close to the book as you can get however, read the book before you sit down to watch the movie. There are several details that are left out that might make you wonder what is going on.     The acting is very well done. The characters stay true to the book.     Overall highly recommended to those 1984 fans.
B002ZG9846|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theater at the time of its release.  I enjoyed it enough to also purchase it in Blu Ray format.  After watching it again, I have to say I found it just as entertaining as the first time.  I know I will watch it again and continue to enjoy it every time I view it.  I completely recommend it!!!!!
B003INBNXO|4.0|Donnie Yen will not disapoint you , with fantastic fight scenes and a remarkable story-line I was very impressed with this movie overall.
3836503050|5.0|I recently purchased this book and have found it's not only filled from start to finish with amazing work by the fantasically creative and talented Gil Elvgren, but the information written about the work was exceptional too. If you're looking for a one of a kind book, that utilizes the image of the 50's through to 70's American/European pin up girls - you're bound to find it in this book! Enjoy!
B000UR9T82|3.0|The product is great, the shipment was really fast (just about a week and I live in France)and the price was good. But...the Amazon site mentionned a french soundtrack and that's why I chose it since my kids don't speak english yet. Unfortunately there's no french version (nor french subtitles)on the item sold by Electronica. Anyway, it's a good lesson, and from now on, I will always contact the seller to know about specific details.

0199536953|5.0|I had previously read Holmes in novel-length, but this is the first I've read Holmes in short form. The shorter form really seems to suit the larger-than-life character that is Sherlock Holmes. Holmes's quirks and ego, and Watson's sycophantic toadying are far more tolerable in smaller doses. Holmes's deductive reasoning is also on full display in these short tales, as attention to the details leads him to the solution, which is always \\"really rather simple, Watson!\\"     It's possible for the reader who attends to the details to figure out the solution to many of these cases, generally at least, if not in all the details. The stories in this volume are just the right length to be suspenseful without being stale. It is easy to see why these detective stories have withstood the test of time.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I bought this album for the song; sweet child of mine. This is one of the songs I remember hearing on the radio but couldn't remember who the artist was. A good find for me. All the songs on the CD are of good quality, no distortions.
068983571X|4.0|This was my first Sherlock Holmes, and it very much lived up to my expectations. In this novel Holmes is called from London to consider the death of Charles Baskerville, apparantly by a crazed and superhuman dog. Reports have come from the manor of a ghostly, dog-like creature that haunts the hills. When Charles's heir arrives to take up residence at Baskerville Hall, Holmes is convinced that the young Baskerville's life is in danger. Watson takes up residence at Baskerville Hall to watch out for Henry Baskerville's safety. When Watson notices strange things happening in the moors, the reader starts to wonder if, in fact, there is something supernatural haunting the moors.<br /><br />The Hound of the Baskervilles is certainly an engaging read. I stayed up late to finish it, and I can imagine that reading it in serials would create great anticipation for the next installment.<br /><br />The one shortfall I found was in my ability to visualize the scenery. I'm not entirely familiar with Dartmoor, and it was difficult sometimes to understand the placement of Baskerville Hall and the surrounding terrain. That's not entirely Doyle's fault, and I certainly did get the sense that the countryside was hilly and desolate.
0140277447|5.0|This is a well crafted account of one, just one, of a long list of 20th century atrocities.  The value of this book may be gauged by the intensity of the campaign modern day Japanese apologists and revisionists have mounted to defame it and its late author, Iris Chang. Iris Chang (like James Yin, Shi Young, and Ron Dorfman before her) has shown a spot light on the ugliest of truths, and it is only by understanding such events, and what human beings are capable in the circumstance of war, that we can hope to quell such actions in the future.  As to the book and the author's many slanderers I can only offer the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt \\"I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made\\".
B00338QENI|4.0|I read this book after reading Emperor of All Maladies  [[ASIN:1439107955 The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer]]. They complement each other perfectly with no overlap. I found myself a few times referring to one book or the other because some of the scientists were mentioned across both books. This is not a topic I am interested in generally but downloaded these two books as samples and was really intrigued. Some people say this book focuses too much on the family and not the science, I agree though I also think that was the author's POV and is framed clearly in the title of the book! That is one reason I recommend EoAM - which is very much about the scientific discovery. By putting these two books together - I was able to see the deep irony of how the cell culturing that was enabled by the tragedy of Ms. Lacks cancer was used to accomplish some of the most significant advances in cancer research and treatment. I thought the author could have done a bit more to discuss the ethical and scientific issues and points of view.
B002KKBV92|4.0|This is a great toy for the kids.  It really engages them in exploring and building for many hours.  They need very little help from parents.  My only complaint is that the set contains 88 pieces, all of which fit very nicely in a samdwhich bag.  The packaging is waayyy over the top, about 10 times the size it needs to be.  Talk zbout waste!  Your kids will love it though.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Having read all the books that were used in this series, I looked forward to it greatly.  I am more than dismayed by actually seeing the production.  It is disjointed and incoherent with a paucity of character development.  One star is all this deserves.   After looking closely at the authors and directors of each episode, I noted that they are all different persons.  I suspect that the disjointed series is due to uncoordinated authorship put to film by different directors.  The outcome is mediocre at best (and not worth watching more than once).
0688014291|4.0|---Summary---  That's a classic book arguing that management of people can be simple (one minute) by applying three basic concepts: Goal setting, praising, reprimand.  There is one key concept stating that it's easier to learn by knowing what to do (i.e. what is right), instead of knowing what not to do (i.e. what is wrong).  This is achieved by putting in place clarity with written goal setting, praising of right behaviours, and reprimanding bad behaviours when the goals and the right behaviours are known.    ---Model/concepts---  One Minute Goal Setting   - Agree on goals, and write each goal on a single page with less than 250 words.   - Take a minute regularly to look at your performance and check if your behavior matches your goal.  One Minute Praising   - Praise people immediately and tell them specifically what they did right.   - Tell people how you feel about their behaviour, and how this impacts the success of other people and the whole organization.   - Encourage them to do more of the same.  One Minute Reprimand   - Reprimand people immediately and tell them specifically what they did wrong.   - Tell people how you feel about their behaviour.   - Explain that you reprimand the behaviour, and still you value the people.   - When the reprimand is over, it's over.    ---Impact---  Even though the model is quite simplistic, there is one extremely powerful concept that can be used in practice, which is: \\"Catch people doing something right\\".  The reason is simple: It's much easier to learn by knowing what to do instead what not to do.  This is indeed a huge motivator for employees, who are rewarded for their successes.  Additionally, when people are rewarded for their good job, they accept more easily the critics (or reprimands).  In my team, this turns out to be a powerful tool.    ---Rating---   - rating Amazon - 4.0/5.0 (206 reviews)   - my rating - 4.0/5.0   - fun factor - 4.0/5.0   - simplicity - 4.5/5.0   - impact - 5.0/5.0    For more details about thereview, its format and metrics refer to my startups and teams blog.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I know some of the kids out there are tweaking out because the 1977 original version is non-anamorphic. But that's because it's...wait for it....the 1977 original version. The only way to make this anamorphic would be to digitally remaster the whole film. Why would any studio go through the time and expense of digitally remastering a film just to provide something that almost any HDTV can do anyway (using the \\"aspect\\" settings)? And if they were going to do that, why not just throw in Dolby 7.1 too? And maybe a few extra Jawas...    If you want to watch a real original version if this movie, this is it. If you want all the modern digital functions and features, stick with the 2004 version. Can't have it both ways without redefining \\"original\\".
B0034G4P7G|4.0|I went to go see this movie in theatres with avg expectations at best, but let me tell you this movie delivered and then some. I had no clue the actualy story of how Facebook got started and was unaware that the guy who started Napster was even remotely involved. I am not sure how accurate this movie is to the true story but none the less, it was a well written story, and this movie wss CASTED perfectly having Jesse Eisenberg (who I feel doesnt get the acting credit he deserves, being compared to Michael Cera WAY @ MUCH), and Justin Timberlake did a incredible job portraying the guy who started Napster.     I have a Blockbuster online membership,but this is the kind of movie you want to own imo, and they have a great deal for their 2 disc special edition DVD,but since I have a Blu Ray im getting it on Blu Ray which I hope includes the same material.       Check out this movie.
0789318121|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GZ6QDS The Dark Knight]] is one of the greatest films of the new millennium...a fact supported by its grossing over $1 billion worldwide (about $1.5 billion after DVD sales), its practically unanimous praising by critics and moviegoers alike (those few naysayers can go screw themselves), and (when stacked against the previous [[ASIN:B000B5XOYI Batman]] films, sans [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins]]) the best superhero comic-adapted film of all time.  Inside this 240 page book are all the elements that went into the making of this amazing film, including:  Storyboard art  Character sketches  Still photos  and perhaps most valuable of all...Nolan's original shooting script!!!  (some slight changes between this and the final film, but ultimately it all worked out for the better).  My only regret for this book is how little of it is dedicated to Harvey Dent/Two-Face.  It's mostly pics of clay sculptings and a short quotation from Aaron Eckhart explaining the special effects.  However, this is not enough for me to downgrade my review from five stars.  This is the perfect companion to [[ASIN:B000GFR9PS The Art of Batman Begins]].  I can't wait for Nolan's next installment in the franchise \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\", due in theaters July 20, 2012 (no question the companion book for that film will be equally spectacular).
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Okay so i decided to wait a bit before writing this review because i had read through so many before buying this that i wanted to make sure nothing was going to happen when i bought it. first off installing this was easy as cake, second i always read reviews saying that with a wireless network in your house that you would have feed back i've had none and im using a netgear n600 and i live in a apartment complex and none whats so ever. the distance between headphone and transmitter i would say is slightly shorter then the 30 feet said i would say closer to 20. next the only time i get crackle and pop is a when i leave that area and that is a bad crackle and pop and also when my battery are close to dead which is about 5 to 6 hours of game play lucky for me i have a rotating set of rechargable that i change out the first time it happens and i dont hear it agian for many hours later. the chat volume for game play is a little wierd to get a hang of but i have the x11 already so i know that to be true for both. the surround sound is great i can pin point people anywhere around me which is nice. all in all very please to add these to my collection that i have already of head phones for my 360 which it will make number 8. my only recommendation is that you get rechargable battery and have them ready to change out when it starts to pop.

B00275EHJG|3.0|Let me start off my family and I love Pixar/Disney movies, have all of them on blu-ray.  We bought the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy set of all three for our daughter(2 year old) for Christmas. We all sat down to watch it and half-way through our daughter stopped watching and asked to watch another movie.  I had to agree with her, I found it to be boring and trying to be to \\"deep.\\"  The characters and storyline didn't feel anything like the first two movies. It had it's funny parts but overall felt it was much more geared to the audience from 11 years ago who have grown up. Biggest family movie let-down for us in 2010. Hoping next Pixar movies isn't as \\"deep\\" and dark.

1439163146|1.0|I am about 3/4 the way through now and I seriously think this entire book is pointless. These teenagers do the most disgusting things, and there is no reasoning behind it. This book is snippets of crap writing, and ridiculous storytelling. I don't really have any positives to say other then that. James Franco may be a wonderful actor, but I am curious to what was going on in his head when he created this monster.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|The only thing that pissed me off about this movie was the disorientation cop out.    Breaks in storytelling, since the narrator loses the plot temporarily. I find this kind of thing sloppy, and the movie kinda over indulged.    Pretty bloody good movie though, and novel in some regards.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|I'm not a good reviewer, but I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed this movie and found it highly informative, as are all of Michael Moore's movies.  Despite the liberal bias, what stands out in this movie, and his others, is his obvious concern for the average American.  He portrays just how the average worker is being forced to work more and more while their corporate bosses feed off of them with their large bonuses, etc.  He calls our society not a democracy but a plutocracy.  He uses humor to make this enjoyable, but it skewers those he makes fun of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  This is a must see.

B000QXDEDG|5.0|For a film based on reality or history, it contains alot of unashamed fantasy and virtual reality. Yet it is pulled together in a balance of weight and seriousness, and the elements of escapism and brutality actually complement each other here. Were it all highly detailed and painstakingly realistic, it might be too laborious to view (unless you wanted a visual history), and were it more fantasy based it would belong in the Star Wars section (and no 'non-nerd' people would want to watch it). I cringed occassionally at the obviously digital effects on screen, but as a whole this was a VERY interesting movie that I definitely enjoyed watching and would watch again.   The characters were respectable, believable and dignified, even though they are made to entertain us.   The digital effects and scenery were rich and artistic, while being dark and non-distracting enough and thus only supported the interesting dialogue and scenes.   It created a near-dreamy effect that played on the imagination and senses and made the viewing experince more rich, without the need for over the top tricks or scenes.   This is a very sensuous film, all sexual elements aside.  The elements of humanness or romance or weakness were not captured in a 'cheesy' or campy way as is typical for almost all movies (IMO) but blended seamlessly into the atmosphere of the whole movie all togehter as an emotional, political, social, and human drama.   I recommend it to anyone who typically shys away form the theaters (like me lol) because this movie actually isnt that bad. It WONT disappoint you like so many others and its definitely enjoyable for a casual evening on the couch :)

The plot was so intriguing and mysterious I would recommend the book to everyone! I believe it is one of the best works of literary fiction.

B000V698DI|5.0|It's the end of 2010, 19 years after this record was released, and I'm going to buy this record for about the 4th time just because Amazon has it on sale. Kurt Cobain didn't make a very good hero or role model, and he didn't want to. His personal life was horrible, his guitar work was mediocre, and the lyrics were often shallow. But he somehow managed to enthrall so many of us, and make music that spoke to us like few did. At the same time, the popularity of Nirvana branded rock music to the extent that little new has come out since. The bluesmen influenced the Beatles and Rolling Stones, who spawned the great golden era of rock in the late 60's and 70's. During that time Led Zepplin and Black Sabbath helped define the hard rock and heavy metal genres that continued after them, and then the grunge movement hit in the early 90's. Most of the music we hear on rock radio today is just Nirvana rehashed the way most rock music before them was just Led Zepplin rehashed. A great example is how much this record doesn't feel dated at 20 years old, but when it came out records that were 20 years old at the time sounded incredible dated. Think about Elvis, early Rolling Stones, or some of the residual hippy music from the early 70's.
B00433TO52|3.0|I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, and I've definitely learned my lesson about sampling before rushing into a great-deal purchase.<br /><br />This collection gets three stars for being a complete collection at a great price. It didn't get five because of a lack of line numbers and a limited table of contents. I would have liked links to each Act, at least, and line numbers are totally required for students.<br /><br />Let me be clear: I am NOT marking this down for my own stupidity of not sampling. Rather, I'm marking it down for its limitations.
B001FB4W16|3.0|Coming from the creator of one of the most enjoyable TV shows (Six Feet Under), I had high expectations for this show. Perhaps unrealistically high.  This show that is basically set inside a secluded bar while critiquing the relationships within a small town seems remarkably similar to a certain show created by David Lynch. However, it doesn't possess any of the suspense or darkness that Twin Peaks had.    If I had to summarize my experience of the 1st season without spoilers I would say this:    1. Enough with the forced Southern accents. They are inaccurate and grating.  2. Too easy to see the comparisons between gay rights and vampire rights. I expect more subtlety for HBO productions.  3. Plot seems to rotate between sex and sucking blood. Could have benefitted from more suspense and mystery.      That said, I'll begrudgingly watch Season 2 to see if it improves.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I was not really sure what to think going into The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the adaption of Stieg Larsson's best-selling Swedish novel. I am not really a fan of crime or mystery novels, but this book has gotten so much attention that I had to check it out. The story follows two protagonists. Mikael Blomkvist is a middle-aged financial journalist who, after being convicted of libel against a very powerful Swedish financier, has been hired to investigate the mysterious disappearance of industry magnate Henry Vanger's niece, Harriet, some 40 years prior. The eponymous Lisbeth Salander is a 24-year old covert researcher who is initially hired to investigate Blomkvist.<br /><br />It takes a little wihle to get going, but after some initial character development Larsson is able to progress the story enough where I started to gain interest. I did have a lot of trouble discerning all of the different characters in the book, which is populated with numerous references to cousins, half cousins, uncles, fathers, etc who make up the Vanger family. It wasn't until the last 100 pages of the story that I actually thought I had everyone figured out. Larsson explores strong themes of sexual depravity and misogyny (as alluded to by the book's original Swedish title - \\"Men Who Hate Women\\") which ultimately form the theme of the entire story. In contrast, Larsson also provides an unusual sexual context around Blomkvist, Salander, and several other character's lives that may be unusual and off-putting to American readers. Partly because of this, I never really found myself caring too much for Blomkvist or Salander the way an author should hope for. Blomkvist is not very likable and Salander comes off as a bit of a brat, even though it's clear her development is surrounded by past childhood sexual trauma.<br /><br />The method of the investigation into Harriet's disappearance is rather dull and lackluster. There certainly were no moments of surprise or shared excitement between Blomkvist and the reader, as one might find in a Sherlock Holmes novel. Blomkvist follows a trail of clues that seem more concerned with luck and happenstance than from any individual talents. With 40 years of investigation, shouldn't the police or the Vanger family have stumbled onto the same path he now follows? Ultimately, the disappearance of Harriet itself is interesting enough that I was able to read through the story without losing interest or growing bored, and I was satisfied with the (initial) conclusion. The main flaws of \\"Girl\\" come from Blomkvist and Salander. Does Blomkvist care about Salander? Is he just interested in her and the other characters in the story for sex or does he actually have feelings for anyone? Does Salander care about anyone? And why should I care about Blomkvist if he doesn't care about anyone else? His and everyone else's strange intimate relationships might be par for the course in Sweden, but they don't work on American readers. And if that's the case, I can't necessarily fault Larsson for living in a different culture, but it does affect my opinion of the story and ultimately will likely lead to my decision not to read the sequels.<br /><br />Finally, the book's second biggest flaw comes at the end. Not with the conclusion to the Harriet Vanger mystery, but with the next 75 pages or so, which detail Blomkvist's attempted revenge against the financier who led to his libel conviction. While this was an underlying plot to the main story of the Vanger case, it did not deserve such a large portion of the book, and felt out of place after I had satiated myself with the Harriet Vanger conclusion. It's almost like the end of a 90's action movie, where you think the story is over until the villain comes back from the dead for one final scene, only it takes several scenes, and it's not the main villain from the movie, but his cousin Steve who briefly had a few scenes in the beginning of the movie. Larsson should have cut this from the book and added it to the beginning of the sequel. It's just not as powerful as the story he previously takes us on.<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is an interesting read, but poor character development and a slightly jumbled plot prevent it from being the acclaimed novel I was expecting, and I think it's more worthy of a passing summer read than the \\"must-read novel\\" it's been hailed as.of the sequel.

B001O1O71C|1.0|There is nothing more frustrating than reading a story that is so unbelievable and so impossible that I cannot possibly believe it, and yet it still tops the best seller list? This is such a blatantly manipulated work of fiction, it offends true Holocaust stories.<br /><br />I have students who tell me this book is a true story. But it can NOT be--Jewish children did NOT live in Auschwitz. They did not make friends with children on the other side of any fence because they would have been shot for getting too close to the fence--that is if they hadn't been gassed already because any child under the age of 15 was exterminated! (unless they were part of Mengele's twins.)<br /><br />My favorite Holocaust book is Rena's Promise, the story of the 716 woman in Auschwitz. That Rena survives her ordeal with love in her heart for humanity, is indeed a miracle. That IS a story and that is true. If you want to read a true account of the Holocaust that is both heart rending and heart warming, do yourself a favor and read Rena's Promise: A Story of Sisters in Auschwitz.
B0045ODPKY|1.0|Everything you see here, you have seen it done better before somewhere else. They are all very easily recognizable. Angelina Jolie really should stick to what she does well, whatever that is. She was barely adequate for Laura Croft, but playing a highly trained assassin is definitely not her thing. The action sequences in this one are painful to watch. Angelina seems slow and weak, and simply fling her arms around most of the time, completely lacks the calculated power and cold efficiency that I would expect from a well conditioned spy. The plot has some big holes, but I only saw the theatrical cut, which from the other comments here, makes even less sense than the other versions.
1591843162|4.0|I liked this book from the opening line: You Are A Genius.<br />Not simply because I want someone to call me a genius, but because Godin is one of the few people who recognizes that most everyone exhibits genius at times.<br /><br />He also explains why people don't understand their own genius more:<br />\\"The tragedy is that society (your school, your boss, your government, your family) keeps drumming the genius part out.  The problem is that our culture has engaged in a Faustian bargain, in which we trade our genius and artistry for apparent stability.\\"<br /><br />Godin does a great job of explaining how this happens and the history of why it has happened.<br />(See Indoctrination: How We Got Here).<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is called The Resistance.  That section is about 50 pages long and attempts to explain the roots of why we fail in our efforts and how that we often take the path of least resistance, which end up being paths of non-creativity.  The section will really make you think.<br /><br />However, that section is also why I only gave this book 4 stars out of 5.  I just think he's wrong on his explanation of lizard-brain.  He sees a different source of the problem that I agree is there.  I read the book ignoring his terms, but enjoying his explanation.<br /><br />Finally, I really liked the section on gifts.  If you are too afraid to give it away, then maybe you aren't really an artist?  Maybe you really only want profit, not the successful creation of something?<br /><br />I consider this book my best read of 2010 because, even though I do not agree with everything he said, Godin definitely gets you thinking new thoughts about the things you do and how we approach creativity and work.  I believe the ideas in the book will live with you and help you produce more of your own genius.  Reading this book is definitely an investment.<br />You'll be happy you read it.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This is the second book in Larsson's series. I found it well-written. It was suspenseful and exciting. Like most sequels, it's not as good as the first book in the series. But, nevertheless, I enjoyed it and I would recommend it.

0312370849|2.0|That this book brings attention to France's atrocious actions against the(ir) Jews during WWII is its only redeeming quality. The primary event, which took place on July 16, 1942, was dubbed (p 27) `\\"The great roundup at the Velodrome d'Hiver...Thousands of Jewish families, locked up there for days, in appalling conditions. Then sent to Auschwitz. And gassed,\\"' (p 50) \\"In the end, France sent nearly eighty thousand Jews to the death camps.\\" These acts (p 116) were performed, \\"By the French government, on French buses, on French trains.\\" In attempting to transform these events into a compelling story, author Tatiana de Rosnay dreamt up an absolutely incredible plot, filled with odds defying moments of extreme coincidence, predictability, and contrivance. Read on (but beware of spoilers) at your own risk.<br /><br />The basis of the novel, absolutely unbelievable to any parent, is one of its biggest flaws. When authorities enter the apartment of a ten-year-old Jewish girl to collect the family, her fearful four-year-old brother hides in a cabinet. She locks him in, pockets the key, promises to return later, and lies to the police, telling them he's gone away. Once outside the building, her mother KNOWING THAT HER HUSBAND AND CHILD ARE SAFE IN HIDING calls out her husband's name. He exits his safety spot and joins his wife and daughter. The first words one would expect to come out of his mouth are, \\"Where is Michel?\\" Instead, he is silent, and doesn't mention the boy until they've gone further. In fact, he chooses not to mention anything to the authorities until many hours later, sealing the boy's fate.<br /><br />Other improbable, unlikely, contrived, or just plain annoying events:<br /><br />It just so happens that the grandmother of one of Julia's acquaintances, Guillame, was the only person in her family who, because of her age, was not rounded up.<br /><br />(p 133) \\"In true American style, [Julia Jarmond] had never been able to drive a stick shift.\\" Since when don't Americans know how to operate a car with manual transmission?<br /><br />Sarah escapes the prison camp WITH HELP FROM A POLICEMAN with whom she is acquainted.<br /><br />With blue eyes and blonde hair she FOOLS A SOLDIER, in spite of the fact that her head is shaved. And why not wear a hat?<br /><br />Julia, a 45-year-old woman with fertility issues, gets pregnant.<br /><br />Julia, a 45-year-old woman with fertility issues who gets pregnant CONTEMPLATES ABORTION. That the author wasted our time showing us how much she agonized over the decision, acting like she was actually going to go through with the procedure, and, at the last possible moment (and not until p 183), has Ms. Jarmond make the choice that is obvious to the rest of us, should be considered an insult to any reader with half a brain. Setting the date for the procedure (impossible to change!) as the anniversary of the Vel' d'Hiv' - adds insult to injury.<br /><br />(p 166) Shouldn't it be, \\"A bat out of hell.\\"<br /><br />The Tezac family moves into the apartment vacated by the Starzynski family two weeks prior. They don't bother to investigate the, no doubt, powerful stench emanating from the locked cabinet (containing Michel), attributing the smell to \\"the drains.\\"<br /><br />A child, Eduouard, is forced to keep a colossal secret from his own mother. Eduouard asks Julia to keep the same secret from her husband (his son). Julia asks her daughter to keep the same secret from everyone.<br /><br />Julia's sister Charla calls directory assistance in the US and obtains Sarah's husband's address and phone number, by asking for the listing by state (and, conveniently, guessing the right state on the second try). Last time I checked, calling information, the operator says, \\"What city please?\\" An internet search would have made much more sense.<br /><br />Julia drives to Sarah's husband's house in Connecticut, showing up unannounced.<br /><br />Julia flies to Italy to see with William, without contacting himahead of time to see if he is even interested in getting together with her. Same with William, who travels to Paris in hopes of getting in touch with Julia, without trying to get in touch with her ahead of time.<br /><br />Zoe, who, fluent (and no doubt accentless) in both French and English (p 267), \\"...accentuat[es] her American accent...\\"<br /><br />Mame, (p 267) \\"Just before her stroke\\" admits to Zoe that she knew about Sarah all along.<br /><br />In a country with 308 million persons, Julia and William end up in the same (albeit large)city.<br /><br />She names her daughter Sarah.<br /><br />Julia and William get married and have a baby named...Michel. Kidding!<br /><br />In summary, thin, predictable plot during which journalist Julia Jarmond gains maximum rewards at nearly every turn in sleuthing out the mystery of Sarah's key. With so many books about the Holocaust and Germany's occupation during WWII, I don't recommend reading this one. Better: Suite Francais by Irene Nemirovsky, Survival in Auschwitz by Primo Levy, Time's Arrow by Martin Amis, The Book Thief by Markus Zusak and Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl.vels to Paris in hopes of getting in touch with Julia, without trying to get in touch with her ahead of time.

B002U6CJCO|5.0|Everyone has their opinion; mine is that the darker, more serious JCVD movies like this (U.S. regeneration), Cyborg, and Sudden Death tend to be his best. There's no doubt the second Universal Soldier movie with Bill Goldberg was just a joke and doesn't fit in with the amazing original and this latest intallment, which would be just as good as part 1 if Dolph Lungren were in it for more than a total of about 5 or 10 minutes.  If you liked the character and feel of part 1, then do yourself a favor and pick this up because it feels like it picks up after a LONG pause since the first one - as if the joke of part 2 never happened.  Yes, Van Damme is getting old but he still looks fierce in this; acts and appears just like a 50 year old zombie on steroids would.  I was very skeptical about this one but after watching my friends copy and having the price drop down to a reasonable $9, I just bought it.  It is undoubtedly one of the four best action movies to come out in the 2000's along with Ong Bok, The Protector, and Rambo 4.
0525423273|3.0|I really enjoyed this read. The characters are well developed and likable (or at least relatable) and the story is often though provoking -- making you think of how you would handle these different situations.     --MINOR SPOILER ALERT --   My only problem with it is that I think it is somewhat unrealistic that this romance should go on for so very long without either of the principle characters realizing it. I started to roll my eyes midway through the book at the \\"I wonder what he really thinks about me\\" lines, which continued until almost the very end.     It's a beautiful love story -- love that their friendship blooms before any romantic relationship, but there is no way it would take 9 months for this relationship to finally be made public.

B002YVAT72|4.0|The ION Profile LP set up easily and was easy to use.  I already have iTunes software and the songs transfered directly into iTunes. I have not yet figured out how eliminate clicks and scratches from the old vinyl recordings so the noise also transfers to the digital recording.  Seems to me that the Audicity software would give a simple, easy to use filter (solution) to this problem.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I could see Bruno being around for a long time. I love this guys voice. The first time I ever heard him was at a Sonic and they we're playing B.O.B's new single \\"nothin on you\\" at the time. I didn't even know it was B.O.B because I was used to him from his old mixtapes. But when I heard the guy on the chorus I was thinking \\"omg who is that?\\" When you have it you have it and Bruno has it. I think this guy could sing about water and people would buy it just because of his voice. There are a select amount of artists who have such uniqeness like Keyshia Cole, Aretha Franklin, Tyrese, and Mary J Blige for example (off the top of my head). You know artists that you can identify just by their singin' voice. I think Bruno Mars is definitely one of those unique artists. What I love most is its actually him singin', no auto-tune, no enhancements. I just hope he doesn't become a victim of what they call fame. I've seen so many artists get completely destroyed by it. And yes I know he got in trouble but everyone deserves a second chance. Sometimes a third, fourth, plus plus till they get it right.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This was my first Lehane book, I finished it in a matter of hours and I was glued to my chair. I thought it was interesting to read the book that the movie was based off of.  I feel I will be purchasing more of his books in the very near future.
B004FDY4LE|5.0|Wow! I am not a fan that has been following the series, books or that follows Zombie films. I happened to come across the series via Hulu and watched the first episode there. I was hooked! It was scary at first with so many questions you want answered like what happened? Where is everyone? Ok, so they just left him there at the hospital? Can't spoil it for others but....    Needless to say I became a fan and looked forward to purchasing the weeks episode on Amazon. I was able to watch the episode with ease instantly with no trouble, the only problem ......waiting a WHOLE WEEK for the next episode!! It's so good your actually scared that the writers will get lazy and the excitement will die down but it hasn't and I hope it won't. For everyone who's not a sci fi fan or into zombies don't worry this isn't your typical sci fi strictly guy series. It has romance, character development, hot steamy affairs :), just the right amount of action and suspense mixed in with a little bit of blood and gore but perfectly done not exagerated and not unbelievable. You get to see the desperation of the characters, the relationships they develop with each other, the lies between them and the way they each view life and survival. It's really more about trying to save the remaining human race and well not die in the process. The cast is great, looking forward to finding out what happened with the father and son who helped the sherrif.     Amazon on Demand: I have bought several episodes, shows, and rented movies via Amazon and on my movie rentals have had trouble here and there with viewing such as pausing, stopping, etc but Amazon has voluntarily without my asking refunded the purchase price whenever there was a problem. There was also one time I did have a problem and had to contact them but received an answer immediately and the problem was fixed. Looking forward to ALWAYS having the same good customer service (hum hum Amazon? ) Good Customer Service = Good Customer :) I use Windows Vista, Laptop, Amazon Unbox.
B004FDY4LE|4.0|Although this episode doesn't follow any part of the comics, it was still a great way to finish up season one of \\"The Walking Dead.\\" However, TS-19 isn't a normal episode when compared to the others. This episode barely shows any human vs zombie conflicts, but it makes up for this by giving an inside look at the infection/virus. Most of the episode is also giving us an inside look at the characters and letting them develop further, but it's still somewhat fast paced for a few minutes in the beginning and for a portion of the end. Much like any other episode of \\"The Walking Dead,\\" this episode leaves you wanting for more. If this is the only episode you didn't yet, and even if you did read a summary of it, I still recommend watching TS-19. (That's what I did.)

The only thing that bother me are the volume controls when u clip it to your pants or wherever sometimes when you move it can move the volume accidentally, besides, it should have an indicator that shows where is the main sound, the chat and the bass. Great quality headphones and headset for the money. You dont regret it and also for 64 dlls wow what a bargain thanks Amazon.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|I can't wait for this HD version to come out because this film is very epic and will be more so in this release, also this version of the film will look as if it were being seen back in 1984.    I am concerned though If Disney does make alterations to the films English dialogue as they have already done this with Kiki's Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky, that will make me mad because I think that this is one of the best dubs ever done by Disney. I don't care if they improve the opening titles to just show the English text, I don't care if they remaster the film or remix it into 5.1 surround sound. I just care about the dialogue being left alone.    I hope this will be worth buying.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|Aside from Statham, this movie is unwatchable.  I'm an action movie fan and certainly don't expect great dialogue or acting in this type of movie, but this one hits a new low.

I'm not thrilled that several of the Bennet girls are a bit prostituted (the madly pouty lips, the bedroom eyes) but whatever it's pretty and I can't not like it.  I am looking forward to S&S more as the artwork doesn't look so lamely sexy.

B002ZG98C8|2.0|Never mind the comically obvious fact that this movie is basically a kind of political propaganda flick. Nobody can deny that. It's transparency can make getting the message across more effective because it is letting you in on what its up to, sort of like in-your-face, wink-wink-nudge-nudge \\"we know You know\\" blatant product placement. I suppose. Anyway what I want to say is the movie is simply not that funny, period. No the politics are not what ruined \\"Machete\\", for me anyway, so much as the way the politics were delivered. My Mexican-American friends didn't like the movie. Because it isn't very funny. Are we learning how Mexicans are persecuted and about corrupt, opportunistic politicians and white racism, etc., or are we doing a comedy inspired by grindhouse and blaxploitation flicks (which means some socio-political commentary)?<br />You can serve-up the laughs along with some soical awareness. Just look at a recent homage to blaxploitation called [[ASIN:B002BWP3W0 Black Dynamite]] to get the right idea. Dig it. And how about just more Machete killing and killing again and Desperado style fights. Brutal action, almost non-stop. But I loved \\"Once Upon A Time in Mexico\\" and \\"Planet Terror\\"... one BIG difference - these movies had more entertaining characters, no? Having Johnny Depp, Salma Hayek, Willem Dafoe, Enrique Iglesias, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes and Rub&eacute;n Blades in your picture helps a lot. Robert De Niro looks half asleep to me through many performances these days and he ain't funny. Lindsay Lohan...whatever. OK, Steven Seagal is funny and could have had a fatter role to play.<br /><br />Look, the Machete preview was *art* as far as I'm concerned and Danny Trejo is still the man.
B002JCSRKC|4.0|For rain boots, these are pretty good.  The price is right, they are lighter than comparable rubber boots.  It doesn't feel like you're walking in lead weights.    For some, these may be awkward.  I found them a tiny bit inflexible around the ankle, then again, compared to rubber boots, they're a little more flexible.  I thought that along with the lightness was a plus.    For cold weather, wear warm socks.  These worked well today in the 20\\" worth of snow-slush in Manhattan, but with wool socks on.    These may be the perfect boot for slush, they look absolutely flawless after a day's walk through salt and brown slush.

He has commandeered the dining room table for the last two evenings and has built about 1/4 of it, judging by the photograph.    The product itself comes in a large box.  Inside, there are four more boxes that contain separate building stages.  Inside those boxes are numbered bags just like other Lego kits.    He's having a blast with this toy.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I researched what fantasy series I should embark on and most pointed towards Martin's &#34;Song of Fire and Ice&#34;.  This book has caught my attention and not let go from the beginning til the end. A book of this scale is rare but to remain as commited to a real sense of feeling for every character is astonishing. Keeping track of the different characters may seem difficult at first but after a short while (and a couple of trips to the appendix of house structures) they seem as though you have met them before. That to me is Martin's greatest achievement with A Game of Thrones; an honest connection with every character in his fantasy kingdom. He does not make the &#34;bad&#34; characters irrational and mistake prone, nor does he make the protaganists invincible and pure.  His characters have a breadth of feelings that make you question their decisions but value their opinions.  While these characters weave you through this sweeping epic, you may forget you are reading fantasy with the amount of factual medieval information he presents in detail.  Magic is but a minor agent in this masterpiece, but when presented, it only makes you read in awe along with the character. To say this book is fantastic would be a gross understatement to Martin's literary prowess.  Enjoy this book if you get the chance, and be prepared to continue on Martin's journey with &#34;A Clash of Kings&#34;.

Austen did a fantastic job with the characters, and their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, she did a great job persuading the reader to switch back and forth to Wickham and Darcy's different sides.<br /><br />P and P is a book to not be overlooked! Everyone can get something out of it, whether that be knowledge, or just another wonderful and fun read.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Disney Special Platinum Edition) is a cartoon that was first shown in the cinemas 1937 and still it is an amazing cartoon. The charchters are still as alive and vivid now as then. The music and songs are amazing and the story which is adapted by the Grimm Brothers is timeless. I love the scenes with the small animals and the scene with the lost small bird is so cute. This is certainly one of Walt Disneys best movies and certainly a nugget in the Disney cartoon vault. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.

0307272702|5.0|Wow, what an important book. One hopes that it will be read by many doctors, nutritionists, and health experts, and will force them to re-examine everything they know about diet, exercise, and weight loss. Lives can literally be saved with the information in this book.<br /><br />Taubes systematically demolishes the following diet myths:<br />1. Weight loss is a simple matter of calories in versus calories out<br />2. If you want to lose weight, all you need to do is \\"eat less and exercise more\\"<br />3. Counting calories is the best way to lose weight<br />4. Obesity is a mental deficiency caused by lack of willpower, and people get fat because they lack discipline to stop eating<br />5. Dietary fat is dangerous<br />and so on...<br /><br />Spoiler alert: it's carbs. Somehow this is controversial these days, despite it being common knowledge for hundreds of years. Carbs lead to insulin which leads to fat. Protein and fat don't make you fat - carbs do.<br /><br />If you've read \\"Good Calories Bad Calories,\\" there's nothing new here. In fact, several of the anecdotes and even entire passages seem lifted directly from stuff Taubes has published before (who can forget the line: \\"Why not skip the bread and the stairs and call it a day?\\").
B00405DUYO|4.0|At long last this film finally makes the theatres. Based on the book by the same name by Steve McVicker, \\"I Love You Phillip Morris\\" is certainly worth seeing-- if for nothing else-- for the performances of the two lead characters Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor who are star-crossed (?) lovers who meet in prison. Carrey plays Steven Russell, the mastermind behind the events that keep getting the two real-life people in and out of prisons, and McGregor is his lover Phillip Morris. While both of these men are extraordinary in their roles, I found McGregor to be even better than Carrey even though at least one critic says Carrey gave one of the best performances by an actor in any film in 2010. Even though Carrey is good, I never forgot that he was Jim Carrey. McGregor, however, completely convinced me he was the blond slightly fey Phillip Morris.<br /><br />The soundtrack is superb, particularly in a particularly emotional scene when Carrey and McEwan get separated as cell-mates as Nina Simone sings the Beegee hit, \\"You don't know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you.\\" Equally effective is Sammi Smith's version of Kris Kristofferson's \\"Help Me Make It Through The Night.\\"<br /><br />The film ultimately suffers from the story line. The writers and director have these outlandish true events to deal with: a lovable con man who could break out of an Egyptian pyramid and law enforcement officers-- often in Texas-- who are dumber than proverbial dirt. What you have is true comedy funnier than anything the writer could have come up with on his own.
B001KMB6X2|2.0|It seemed interesting, but honestly it felt like this movie was just filming without a direction. You never really understand the purpose of some characters, scenes seem randomized, and the ending was like they wanted to make a shocking twist but in the end you just are thinking why did I watch this film. Honestly this film was a huge disappointment.
B002ZG999U|2.0|4 out of the 5 of us fell asleep half way thru.  Reminded me of watching my teenage boys playing Call of Duty or some other fighting video game.  Fake background really noticable...not sure if it was our new 240 hz hd tv or what.
159562015X|5.0|The company I work for made it a requirement to help us to develop our individual action plans. The profile really identifies your strengths. I think they are right on in the belief that if whatever you are doing is not one of your strengths you won't succeed in it to your fullest no matter how much you try, however if you focus on your genetic,God given strengths you will excel in them. I think for corporations this is a great way to manage your workforce and put everyone's strengths to work for you.

0525951652|5.0|I have been waiting for somebody like Ken Follett to write an epic fiction series about the 20th century -- unlike many other reviewers here, I had never read a Follett book before:  Fall of Giants exceeded my expectations.  I usually shy away from mammoth books because I rarely find time to read for more than 30 minutes at a time:  But I literally raced through Fall of Giants.  Because of the different plots, the book never gets boring as Follett switches back and forth between the families and theaters he describes.  At the same time, the various plots are not confusing at all, the characters are very well developed and the backdrop (World War I) is meticulously researched, as I understand is typical for Follett.  A true masterpiece -- Can't wait to read the second part of this trilogy.

1405240474|5.0|I grew up on these books and received a set when my first child was born. My kid are boys, age 4.5 and 2.5. We read the Mr. Men books every day, at least three books a day. Almost all of the stories are excellent (there are one or two that are not great). No other books really keep my children this engaged. The set is expensive, but well worth it. My kids love these books.

I timed my start so my first binge day was Christmas day...that worked out well. I am focusing of fat loss right now and once I get to my goal weight I'll start focusing on building some new muscles. If the muscle building advice works as well as the fat loss advice...2011 will be an awesome year for me :)

B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is the real deal on GameCube controllers.  It is an official Nintendo branded controller and performs exactly as it should.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a better way to play your GameCube titles on your GameCube or Wii.  It also makes a great controller for WiiWare and Virtual Console titles.  This item is imported from Japan, but don't fear the Japanese characters on the box, it will work just fine with your American Wii or GameCube console.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This isn't a five-star film. It's spotty, sloppy, and self-indulgent, more a diatribe than a documentary. My five-star rating is a vote of solidarity with Michael Moore's position: that American health care as a system is inadequate and unworthy of a modern nation. Moore is a 'muckraker' in the honorable tradition of American journalism, and there's plenty of 'muck' to be raked in America, the only wealthy Western democracy that doesn't support a system of universal health care. Moore's targets are the profit-driven insurance companies - HMOs chiefly - the greedy drug companies, and the special-interest 'bagmen' in Congress, from both parties, who collaborate in keeping American health care expensive and inequitable. America and the American people spend more money, both in aggregate and per capita, on health care than any other nation, yet America lags in most statistics of health care quality, and that's a sickening state of affairs.<br /><br />However, what's \\"sickening\\" about Sicko is that it won't persuade those people who have virulently resisted health care reform in the USA. Those who already recognize the failures of for-profit, insurance-dominated health care will applaud Moore's witty cinematography, but those who deny that the system needs reform will latch onto Moore's personal idiosyncrasies and partialities as evidence that health care reform is a big-government intrusion and a socialist plot against Mom and Apple Pie.<br /><br />Some Americans enjoy very good health care. I do, when I happen to be in the USA. I have Kaiser Permanente coverage, which has been fully adequate to cover two very expensive procedures for me, but Kaiser Permanente is one of the villains in this film. Yes, Kaiser and other HMOs are guilty of the misdeeds Moore exposes, but his depiction of them is too one-sided, too selective. Anyone who has had good experiences with Kaiser, as I have, will be skeptical of Moore's integrity. That's 'sickening' because Moore is basically correct. Insurance-managed health care is unfair, capricious, supremely inflationary, and above all UNAVAILABLE for millions of people. The Constitution of the USA pledges the federal government to \\"promote the general welfare\\" of the People, a commitment to a sense of community that is not fulfilled by a system of health care that excludes the poorest and sickest.<br /><br />Moore is also too one-sided in his portrayal of the universal health care systems of other countries, particularly of Canada, France, and Cuba. It is true that those countries provide free or nearly free health care to everybody, despite any 'pre-existing conditions' and despite the disqualification of poverty. It's true that citizens of those countries enjoy a sense of security that many Americans lack. It's true that statistics demonstrate better results - lower infant mortality, greater longevity, better overall health - in those countries than in the opulent USA. But it's also true that the national health care systems of Canada and Europe are far from perfect. There are long waits for procedures, MRIs for instance, in Canada. There are complaints, angry complaints about health care in Germany and England -- as there are of course in Massachusetts and Hawaii -- but Michael Moore doesn't report those complaints. His one-sidedness weakens his case.<br /><br />I've experienced health care needs abroad, by the way, for myself in Spain and Germany, for my family in France and Canada. I've gotten effective, prompt, courteous treatment of urgent medical problems like strep throat in Spain, with no paperwork and no hassle. My family has gotten house calls from doctors in France, as Moore depicts. The right wing insurance-industry propaganda against 'socialized' health care in Europe is just as deceptive and unscrupulous as Moore declares. National Health Care is effective and economical in ways that profit-driven health care can't duplicate. I only wish Michael Moore could have made a more convincing case for it.<br /><br />Ex-Vice President Dick Cheney famously accused Michael Moore, at the Republican Convention in 2004, of being disingenuous. That might seem like 'the pot calling the kettle black' since Cheney has been proven to be a consummate opportunist of disinformation. But it's also inaccurate. Moore is anything but disingenuous; his positions and his intentions are always blatantly clear. In this film, when he briefly poses as the Devil's Advocate for American health care, he's utterly unconvincing. He can direct, but he can't act. His ingenuousness is painful at times; for instance, he delivers one of his strongest endorsements of socialized medicine -- yes, he IS a socialist! -- with a bust of Karl Marx visible behind him. What's disingenuous about that? Unfortunately, many 'conservative' Americans will react to such deliberate honesty as mere provocation. Moore would do better not to taunt his adversaries, assuming that his goal is to persuade them.<br /><br />But then, is the goal of Sicko really to persuade or to entertain? In the end, it fails of one and succeeds at the other.Dick Cheney famously accused Michael Moore, at the Republican Convention in 2004, of being disingenuous.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|I always try to watch all movies that come out most are not worth buying but this one I might buy. I think all the guys in the movie are hot & the story is good.
1594488843|5.0|This is one of those must read books for those of us who just dont seem to fit the \\"if/then' model of corporate motivation. I was a bit skeptical at first, being that I had been brought up in an enviornment where carrots and sticks were used to motivate me and I guess I thought always worked.    This book got me to realize why with certain subjects even though I had amazing grades I couldnt apply what I was \\"learning.\\"     It also helped me in my professional life. It gave me the insight into how to motivate those around me and how to become a very productive member of my firm rather than someone who just did the \\"9-5\\" got his work done and went home. When you are armed with the tools and insight given to you within this book, work becomes more meaningful and one cant wait to get into those tasks that seemed somewhat mundane and dreary.    All in all this is a great book to purchase and not a difficult read at all. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who looks at the workforce and says \\"something isnt right here.\\"
B0027BOL4G|5.0|My daughter who is a Nutrition major had me watch this documentary.  It was unbelievably honest.  I now eat mostly organic foods as a result of this film and am appalled at the way our mainstream food is processed.  This should be required watching for everyone.
160094048X|3.0|First i want to say is that i wish i could rate this at 3 3/4 star instead of just an 3.  Also, I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but i am looking to convert. So this is my first vegan cook book.    SO far..OK! I've made 3 recipes. Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows, Cowboy Cookies, and City Girl Snickerdoodles. There are several factors on why i gave the book 3 stars.    PROS:  - I love the style of the book.   - The sarcastic & funny descriptions of the recipes just makes me want to buy more of her books.  - This book has lots of pictures, and i just love me a book with some pictures!  - The variety in the recipes is great. You kinda get 2-3 books in one!  - And lastly 2 out of 3 recipes turned out GOOD, with alterations.    CONS:  - The one con is that i had to alter all the recipes i've made so far, which a BIG deal for ME since a lot of the alterations were common sense things, which i expect to be already corrected. I have also read other reviews on this book and others had problems with a lot of recipes too.     The cookies i have made..    City Girl Snickerdoodles - Oh these were horrible. They taste nothing like a snickerdoodle, not even a sugar cookie. I looked at the recipe and i was unimpressed that this cookie had little to no spice, so i added some spice to the dough myself. I usually judge a cookie by the taste of the dough(i know, WEIRD), so when i tasted the dough it had a soured lemon taste! All the ingredients were fresh and no i did not use any lemon in these cookies. When the cookies baked, it tasted the same..Soured & lemony! But one good thing i had to say about the cookie is that it was soft and chewy.    Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows - OK. Didnt live up to the hype from the vegan forums. The chocolate dough was a little difficult, i had to add 5 extra tablespoons of rice milk, and extra sugar too(which i still think it needs more!). And when i was making the pillows the dough kept cracking even though i had re-chilled it multiple times AND i wasnt handling the dough much.    Cowboy Cookies- Really Good..buttery too. I had to add extra milk to this cookie too. I used marshmallows instead of chocolate. But i think chocolate will better the next time around.    So basically i LOVE this book but i do not like that i have to alter the recipes! I will be making more of her cookies VERY soon, so hopefully i can edit my review in the future. I would also recommend this book to meat & dairy eaters like myself.
0446677450|5.0|I thought I had the basics of financial literacy down pretty pat, but this book opened my eyes to a much more clear way of viewing things.  I have observed the self-destructive behaviors that Kiyosaki describes in the people around me, as well as some of the wealth-building behaviors. This book helps to understand how these behaviors were learned, and how to begin to unlearn them.  He does a great job of presenting simple criteria to judge assets vs. liabilities (and it's more refined and useful than the definition most people use).  I already had faith that understanding basic concepts about money is essential for everyone who handles it, so I can without reservation say that everyone who is responsible for their own money should read this.  It's a fairly quick read, but contains a lot of thought-provoking points that kicked my brain into a flurry of activity.  I already have made some changes to my wealth-building plans.
B002361MLA|3.0|So I thought this book was very interesting, but heres the thing... Unless you practice his techniques as much as a monk does, it will not do anything special for you.  Enlightenment is near impossible to achieve in this society.  If you are reading this because you want to simply educate yourself on the topic of enlightenment, than this is a great book to read. If you are looking to this book to actually enhance your life in anyway, than i beleive you need to look elsewhere,  enlightenment is nearly impossible to acheive.

B00002MZ2C|4.0|This is the first album I've heard from this former band, and unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations, at first. Then, it grew on me. I realized the vitality and moderate fierceness of this Rage Against the Machine album. By the way, don't be fooled; just because it doesn't have the Parental Advisory doesn't mean that it's clean.<br /><br />Although I was aware of its rap and rocking style, the lyrical delivery was unsoundly opaque at times. I'm not used to commenting on rap-oriented lyrics, but political, wartime, violent, and deathly topics are expressed on this CD. Most, not all, of the lyrics are sensible but not always straightforward; at times, they may be abstract. One thing praiseworthy of this CD is that it encourages people to get more involved in what's going on in the world, but that's if they choose to read the lyrics. The delivery of the vocals are quite dynamic.<br /><br />The rhythms are generally tough and solemn. They're headbangers. At first when you hear this album, you may not like it, but if you give it another chance, it can grow on you and you can see the value in it. You'd wish to understand the lyrics. My friend made a point: if you want to convince your audience, make your lyrics clear. If you listen closely to the lyrics, you can pick up on some things being uttered. However, you'll enjoy the catchy choruses.

B003L77GH4|5.0|The books may have been geared towards teenagers (which I am not one) but the TV series stands up to the best of the best on the air right now.  It has been years since any show has captivated me or my friends where we count down the days, then the hours, until showtime.  Well written plots move very fast, which means if you actually miss an episode, you better download it off iTunes before the next episode.  If you can look past the stunningly beautiful cast, you will be pleasantly surprised at the talent and chemistry stuffed into one hour.  There have been moments of shock, moments of love, moments of warm fuzzies that will stay with you for days.     I have made it a goal to introduce everyone I care about to TVDs and I have yet to fail in my quest to convert them into fans.  I get thanked repeatedly.  I've even brought on new Twitter people to follow the cast since most of them are active tweeters.  So if you have some mind block where you won't tune in because its in the middle of Season 2, or you think its for preteens, you are dead wrong.  Currently on Thursday at 8 pm EST on The CW.  Watch it... you may even dream about it because it is that good.

B0046UGSNS|5.0|A modern film.  First off, I give it a rating of 6/10 stars.  Personally, I thought the best thing about this film was the scenery and the music.  Mark Ruffalo was hilarious in this film.  I thought that Mark Ruffalo, Josh Hutcherson and Anette Bening brought the best talent to the screen.      I thought that the trailer was a bit misleading.  The storyline was a little weak.  At some points I debated whether or not it was about love, family or Mark Ruffalo's character becoming the villain.  I thought the organization was slightly off and due to the fact that there's no perfect conclusion for this film I was disappointed.    The few funny quotes that the characters share during the movie is what really binds it.  If there's no other film on your list then give this a shot.  More than likely, you won't be disappointed.
0553805371|3.0|The Grand Design is an approachable book about quantum physics and the universe(s).  The topics in the book are within the grasp of a reader who has taken an introductory physics or astronomy course, but the reader is no more enlightened after completing the book.    For the general public, Death by Black Hole has better content and a more humorous writing style.  It is the standard.
B00493AD74|5.0|If you'd like to watch a film that you can relate to... perhaps it reminds you of a friend or family member or even yourself, watch it! You will learn something after watching this.

If you can appreciate great talent, beautiful directing and editing- why haven't purchased seen this yet?    It's funny, warm, sad and thought-provoking.

Anyone can appreciate this film's value.

B004EJ14V2|3.0|I expected a lot more from this film.     It's really amazing.  In my opinion, Stanley Tucci (the father) and his character's wife really bring the comedy into this film.  I feel that it's appropriate for it's targeted age group- although I would've hired more experienced actors... I thought that the leading character, her parents and her best friend, Ali Michalka were the only great talent.  The directing was okay.  I was somewhat disappointed.  Rating of the film: 5/10 stars.     If you want a laugh, check it out!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Judging by the 1k+ reviews here and the 25-person wait list for the trilogy books at my library, I don't need to recap the plot for you yet again. Onward.<br /><br />The story is told in a tense, clean style. Katniss' internal life is clear and vivid and so is the reasoning behind the careful, calculated decisions she must make. (I was refreshed by a strong female protagonist *not* swooningly in love with a boy for once). Realizing that intelligent readers don't need to be spoonfed their reaction to a good book, Collins lets the horror of the setting speak for itself without trying any ill-advised overdescription or editorializing. (People criticizing the lack of in-book condemnation of the Games: you feel that feeling in your gut or your chest when you think about it? That queasy, upset, repulsed feeling? *That's* your condemnation right there.)<br /><br />The open-ended conclusion is well done, and a lot better than wrapping it all up neatly in a bow, which would have effectively severed the connection we've felt all along by tossing all that hard-achieved believability right out the window. Remember this is part of a trilogy, not a story meant to stand completely alone.<br /><br />I particularly found the depiction of the stylists, interviewers and media circus chilling -- how many times have we watched media craft a compelling and voyeuristic \\"angle\\" around some competitor in a less-lethal sport? Seen an Olympic athlete emerge as a crowd favorite because of that hook? Witnessed people getting caught up in the artificially created character of someone on a \\"reality\\" show? And how many times have we seen that people intimately involved with brutality can distance themselves from the reality of it, interact intimately with the people affected by that brutality and ultimately send them off to be chewed up and spat out by it?<br /><br />None of what Collins writes about is new, from the Roman gladiators to the deprivations of Auschwitz to the totalitarian oppression of East Germany. She syncretizes it into something completely believable -- and the understatedness of characters' reactions to it, their occupation with practical concerns, is part of that believability.<br /><br />Yes, this is a violent (in concept; not so much in explicit gore) and upsetting story. Yes, you need to be aware of your kids' emotional maturity before you hand it to them and you should TALK ABOUT THE STORY WITH THEM. No, you should not read it if you suffer from PTSD or nightmares. Honor your own boundaries by all means, but I think people who pan this book for being disturbing are completely in the wrong; it's supposed to be disturbing. If we're not disturbed, we're inhuman, just like the Capitol consumers of the Hunger Games. Katniss is caught in a situation with an utter sick wrongness that can't even be adequately expressed, but she's *caught* in it, and she has to make choices based on that. That is what makes the story compelling and worthwhile.s it into something completely believable -- and the understatedness of characters' reactions to it, their occupation with practical concerns, is part of that believability.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|One thing that worried me about buying this set was that I'd read that new music was created for this set because they were unable to obtainable licensing for the original music (for a reasonable price, I assume).  After having watched the first 3 seasons I have to say that while I sometimes notice the music does not seem to be what I remember, it doesn't detract from the overall greatness of the show.  The witty dialog and capture of teenage angst still ring out loud and clear, in spite of any musical track changes.  IMO, this DVD set is a great purchase.
B0010AN7Z4|4.0|It can when you feel the ending inappropriately sweetens an otherwise sour story.<br /><br />Billy Wilder is one of the great writer-directors. Though working in a variety of genres, including war (\\"Five Graves to Cairo\\"), romantic comedy (\\"Sabrina\\"), melodrama (\\"Witness for the Prosecution\\"), drama (\\"The Lost Weekend\\"), farce (\\"Some Like It Hot\\"), biography (\\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\"), and film noir (\\"Double Indemnity\\" -- arguably the ur-bach of that genre), he's best remembered for his cynical, nearly black, view of humanity.<br /><br />In films such as \\"Ace in the Hole\\", \\"Double Indemnity\\", \\"Stalag 17\\", \\"Kiss Me, Stupid\\", and \\"Sunset Blvd.\\", he paints a bleak picture of human beings and human \\"values\\". People are shallow, self-centered, and (most of all) greedy. As the tag line for \\"The Fortune Cookie\\" goes...  \\"There are two kinds of people -- those who'll do anything for money, and those who'll do /almost/ anything.\\"<br /><br />As a life-long cynic, I've always most-enjoyed Wilder's \\"black\\" side, especially its implicit condemnation of American society, one of the most shallow and materialistic in history. Wilder left Europe to escape the Nazis, and luckily for us, found a gold mine of material for social criticism and satire in America. Unfortunately for both Wilder and his fans, \\"The Apartment\\" was the last of his \\"good\\" films, as he slid into sentimentality (\\"The Fortune Cookie\\" being particularly obnoxious).<br /><br />As for \\"The Apartment\\"...<br /><br />There is no fundamental difference between good drama and good comedy. Both are character-driven, and in both we see recognizable humans with plausible motivations make choices, and the results -- good or bad -- of those choices.<br /><br />There are problems when mixing comedy and drama. * Because a comedy must necessarily have a \\"happy\\" ending (or at least a not-unhappy one), the dramatic elements are likely to be seen as unimportant. C C Baxter's problem -- that he's become a sort of \\"pimp\\" for his bosses, in expectation of promotion -- doesn't weigh heavily on him -- until he discovers that the woman he worships from afar (Fran Kubelik) is the mistress of one of the company's major executives (J D Sheldrake). ** Given that Baxter -- especially as portrayed by Jack Lemmon, for whom the role was explicitly written -- is a fundamentally decent person, the story's outcome is irreversibly fixed at this point. Dr Dreyfuss needn't have urged Baxter to \\"be a mensch\\" -- he would have eventually gotten around to it, because that's the kind of person he is. (\\"The Fortune Cookie\\" fails for the same reason. Lemmon's character is so clearly defined at the beginning that the ending is a foregone conclusion.) The only reason we don't lose interest is Wilder and Diamond's writing -- they can find solid humor in almost anything, and do.<br /><br />Wilder and Diamond are /so/ focused on being funny -- and they're /brilliantly/ funny -- that the drama is shortchanged. \\"The Apartment\\" is ultimately unsatisfying, because it doesn't work /as drama/. Both Baxter and Kubelik are reactive characters -- they've fallen into their situations, rather than having initiated them. Had they been more-complex and morally ambiguous people who were consciously \\"on the make\\" *** and had created the situations they're in, the untangling of their knotted lives would be more interesting and compelling -- though likely less-comic.<br /><br />Though both eventually \\"wake up\\" to the truths of their lives, they merely \\"step away\\" from their problems. As difficult as this is, /they do not change/ -- they simply return to being the persons they \\"really\\" are. And that doesn't make for interesting drama. Holis Alpert's criticism of the film as \\"a dirty fairy tale\\" has some truth to it -- the \\"fairy tale\\" part, anyway. The last 60 seconds are too pat, and suggestive of the decline that Wilder's work would soon enter. Yes, the ending is /somewhat/ ambiguous.

030726999X|5.0|Excellent end to the trilogy. It was a great book and he did quite well with the way he ended the book. Things that weren't clear in the first two books became clear in the end. I also love the way, the mean characters got their due as they deserved it. Stieg Larsson had a very sick mind (in a good way of course) to have thought of some of the things he did in these books. I loved the hell out of Lisbeth. I loved her strength and resiliency. She went through so much and still persevered in the end. I love the way she got retribution in the end. Although, I'm sure people would have loved to see her thrown in jail, I'm glad she wasn't because of all the stuff she went through, jail wouldn't have been right. I loved her defense team. They are a prime example of a great defense team that believes in you. Definitely a must read!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have two Panasonic cameras and a three lens packed in the bag along with the battery charger.  Padding is good, size is perfect for me, construction quality is good.  I'm a Maxepediton fan so I am hard to please.  This bag could pass for Maxepediton, its that good.  If Maxepedition made it then you would pay at least $120.  This bag is a great camera bag and a great bargain - go for it.  I would happily purchase again and highly recommend it.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|First saw this movie in sixth grade maybe?  We had a TEST after watching... a fill-in-the-blank test! Literally asked on the test: What did Stewart's character say were the three greatest sounds on earth?  Seriously! (Answer is in the movie.)    Aside from isolating Christmas movies, this is one of the best examples of developing characters.  EVERY major character is developed, you enter the story, HATE Mr. Potter when he tries to get a good guy arrested, etc.  Gritty enough to have a near suicide, touching enough to be a great Christmas movie emphasizing importance of family and friends.  I try to go with BluRay every time with a good screen and sound, whether old or new movie.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Bought these in May 2010.  I waiting to write this review until I had a good amount of use out this headset.  At first there was popping whenever I had the chat cable in.  Amazon exchanged the whole headset no questions asked and the second pair I got has worked great ever since.  It makes such a huge difference in online play to be able to hear where people are attacking you from.  Plus I don't have to worry about waking up the kids.  Only thing I recommend is investing in rechargeable batteries.  Eneloops seem to work great for me.
0307454541|4.0|I read this 590 page novel over the course of three days. The reading was by no means laborious. I ate everything up, though the first 130 pages seemed slow. The author then introduced a revenge plot and suddenly my interest greatly picked up. I burned through the remainder of the novel in two more reading sessions.<br /><br />As a piece of popular fiction, this is definitely an effective mystery. I personally don't read too much mystery or popular fiction for that matter, but for whatever reason the enourmous amount of hype surrounding this novel drove me to indulge. Do not dive into the novel expecting great literature. This has been translated and there is literally no effort put into description. All attention is paid to the characters' actions, their reactions, with a little dialogue in between. That being said, it's an easy read.<br /><br />The plot structure does deliever, otherwise I wouldn't have finished this novel so quickly. It's been written in a way that makes the reader want to know what happens next. I wouldn't say the male protagnoist was particularly sympathetic, especially considering the obvious fantasies that have been granted to his character. The female protagonist engenders respect due to her abnormalities and the pity the reader is forced to feel for her. This novel is wholly sensational and combines a number of elements well known to the mystery genre. This is in part why is has become such a success.

The story is incredibly predictable, the \\"action\\" is about as realistic as Star Wars and I can't believe I am going to say this, Jolie looks too skinny and not nearly as attractive as she usually does.

0307272702|5.0|The brilliant thing about science is that when something is disproved once, it's disproved forever. The not-so-brilliant thing about public health policy is that it has little to do with science.    Everyone in the developed world knows what's causing our obesity epidemic. BBC nailed it: \\"We eat too much, and too much of the wrong things,\\" and Michelle Obama tells us \\"We have to move more.\\" Clearly what we need is a balanced diet of lean meats, some good fats, and complex carbohydrates like fruit, vegetables and whole grain bread, and exercise of 30 to 90 minutes per day. Their prescription is completely reasonable and makes intuitive sense.     It is neat, plausible, and wrong. It has in fact been disproved, as nearly as \\"disproof\\" can exist in nutrition science.    In his previous book, Good Calories Bad Calories, respected science journalist Gary Taubes exhaustively researched and cited two centuries worth of research in nutrition. He came to the conclusion that none of those recommendations is supported by science, because the fundamental theory on which they're based is wrong. Why We Get Fat is an updated summary of that earlier work, much quicker and easier to read, with some significant points clarified.     The most important point of the book is that all those public recommendations -- the food pyramid, the \\"eat food, not too much\\" approach, everything we know about a balanced lifestyle -- is founded on the premise of Calories In vs. Calories Out. That we get fat because we eat too many calories, or we don't burn enough of them through movement. But this is nonsense. It's not just wrong, it is actually not a statement about what causes obesity at all (or heart disease, cancer or diabetes, for that matter.) It is, in Taubes' words, a \\"junior high level mistake,\\" because it tells us nothing about fat accumulation. If we get fat, by definition we have taken in more calories than we've put out -- but WHY we took in those calories, or didn't burn them, is the key point.    Taubes reviews the scientific literature (rather than the popular press) and presents a conclusion that was common knowledge before WWII, and heresy afterward: we get fat because our fat cells have become disregulated and are taking nutrients that should be available to other tissues. Like a tumor, the cells live for themselves rather than in balance with the rest of the body. And since those nutrients aren't available, we become hungry and tired. Therefore we eat more, and move less.      For the chronic dieters among us, one passage about animal models will explain decades of frustration. Rodents with a particular part of the hypothalamus destroyed would become obese and/or sedentary *as a consequence* of their bodies putting on more fat. \\"After the surgery, their fat tissue sucks up calories to make more fat; this leaves insufficient fuel for the rest of the body...The only way to prevent these animals from getting obese is to starve them...they get fat not by overeating but by eating at all.\\" Sound familiar?    The problem isn't one of gluttony and sloth, as Taubes refers to it, but of hormone balance. Simply put, some people are more sensitive to the hormone effects of insulin, cortisol, and a few other -ols, than other people are. The more sensitive you are, the more you're likely to get fat, and the more fat you're likely to get, in the presence of even small amounts of carbohydrate -- and in the absence of enough fat.     That's right, this book advocates eating fat. Not just moderately, but as much fat as possible, up to 78% of calories. Not lean meats, not Jenny-O 99.6% fat-free turkey, not skinless chicken breasts, but lard. Yes, lard. The healthy way of eating, according to Taubes, is moderately high protein and high fat. Yes, high fat. About a 3:1 ratio of fat to protein, and almost no carbohydrates. (Telling people to eat a balanced diet containing carbohydrates is, he says, equivalent to telling smokers to include a balanced serving of cigarettes.) And he demonstrates exactly why a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet is the most heart-healthy approach, as borne out by several dozen recent studies.     While Taubes acknowledges that exercise seems to be good for us for a variety of reasons, weight control isn't one of them. Study after study conducted by proponents of exercise have admitted that they see no compelling evidence for exercise as a weight-loss tool. And it makes sense if you throw out the calories in/calories out model of why we get fat. If we're fat because our fat tissues are starving the rest of our cells of fuel, exercise is just going to make us hungrier and more tired, not leaner and more fit. (It's worth noting that according to Taubes, in the 1930s obese patients were treated with bed rest.)    [This review was edited to clarify the following point.] The main thrust of Taubes' argument, however, surrounds sugar and to a lesser extent any carbohydrate. Insulin is the primary hormone that fixes fat in the fat cells. This is why Type I diabetics lose weight: they're not producing enough insulin. Since insulin is manufactured in direct response to carbohydrates, if you don't eat them, you won't have a mechanism by which to store fat. (Taubes notes that this mechanism is not controversial; it simply hasn't had an impact on nutrition policy.) Taubes argues that any success in standard diets can be attributed directly to the dieter's reduced intake of carbohydrates, especially sugars and particularly fructose.    Once the underlying cause of obesity is understood (hormone balance, not gluttony/sloth) the recommendations on what to do about it are surprisingly simple and therefore brief. This is a book about the science of nutrition, not a diet book, but there is a list of recommended foods in the Appendix. The book does not tell you how to eat in a restaurant. But it does tell you that the issue isn't in your brain, your willpower, your character, your job, your environment or even (except to the extent that you're sensitive to carbohydrate) in your genes. The problem with fat is in your fat cells.    For a lay audience, this book is as good as it gets if you want to read actual science about health and nutrition. If you're of scientific or technical bent, read Good Calories Bad Calories first, then give Why We Get Fat to your parents.

0375842209|5.0|I found this book by chance and I decided to give it a try based on the back cover summary. I love books dedicated to WWII and the topic surrounding the Holocaust. Man, I am so glad I read it! I absolutely loved this book. Narrated by \\"Death\\" about a young girl, Liesel Memminger's account of living in Germany during the rise of the Nazi party. You get a good snapshot of what it must have been like during that time. There are many twists thrown into the story about the fist fighter Jew, her friendship with her friend Rudy, her \\"Papa\\" and \\"Mama\\" and most importantly her love affair with books, which is the catalyst for this story. I just loved the entire book from beginning to end. Markus Zusak did an outstanding job, so much so that I am going to read another of his books. He did a fabulous job bringing to light what the power of words can do in a person's life. The words can hurt, as illustrated by Hitler or in Liesel's case the power to heal, bring others together, and ultimately change lives, which it also did for me! Thanks Mr. Zusak!!!

B0043GAZYS|5.0|I attended a viewing of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World on opening night and right away was saddened that the theater wasn't packed full. I hadn't yet seen whether it was any good or not, but in a Hollywood of the \\"same-old, same old\\",  I was routing for a movie that has originality written all over it. I should also state that unlike most comic book inspired movies that I've walked into, I had no previous knowledge of anything Scott Pilgrim-related aside from the PSN game that I had just started playing days before.<br /><br />I'll get this out of the way right now too. I'm not a big Michael Cera fan, to the point where I'll avoid movies that he's in just because I'm sick of seeing that same character done over and over again. Despite this, I was still very excited to see Scott Pilgrim. For the first time in a long time, I felt that it was finally a role where Cera could play his usual character and it actually made sense.<br /><br />Inception is being applauded by Hollywood and fans alike because it successfully brought something new and fresh to the table. Scott Pilgrim is no different. Edgar Wright has certainly stepped up his game here. The direction, editing, and overall tone of the movie are absolutely perfect. The visual inspirations and sounds borrowed from video games make this a movie that any gamer should flock to. The relentless pace of the movie and quick (yet brilliant) transitions may feel rushed for some, but to me it felt like a story that hit the ground running and kept the action flowing.<br /><br />There are several times during the movie where the average skeptical viewer may question events as they play out. Why does everyone have all these powers and crazy fighting abilities? What's up with Ramona having snow melting roller skates and jumping through random doors? Why do people burst into coins? All of these questions are fair, but they apply to the real world. The world we see in Scott Pilgrim is one that none of us have seen before, and yet holds some familiar properties. The only way you'll really enjoy this movie is if you stop asking questions and just go with it. They're not creating plot holes by NOT answering these questions, they're simply not willing to slow down the pace to give us answers we don't need.<br /><br />The action is incredibly visceral and satisfying. I don't know if it was just my identification with the plight of Pilgrim, but I felt myself wanting to jump up out of my seat and get involved. Not since seeing the rage of the Hulk unleashed onscreen have I had such a similar reaction to on-screen combat.<br /><br />As far as the characters and performances go, there's a lot to be had here. Ramona Flowers (Winstead) could have been a little warmer, but I could see how damaged she is (sexy too, I'd certainly fight off seven evil exes for her). Knives was as annoying as expected. Unlike some, I at no point found myself rooting for her as she seemed far too young in comparison to everyone else. Anna Kendrick is adorably meddlesome as Scott's sister Stacey and is quickly becoming one of my biggest Hollywood crushes. As far as the evil exes go, Chris Evans and Brandon Routh were by far the stand-outs to me. In a completely unexpected yet pleasant surprise, Kieran Culkin steals just about every scene he's in as Scott's gay roommate Wallace. I came out of this movie a much bigger fan of his and look forward to seeing where his career is headed. And yes, I'll admit it. Michael Cera was great. Now leave me alone. More reviews at: [...]ies.

B002ZG9846|5.0|Dave Lizewski (Johnson) is an \\"invisible\\" high school student. His day-to-day life is underwhelming. He lives alone with his father and spends the majority of his time hanging out at a comic store with his buds. The pivotal point in his life is when he asks the simple question, \\"Why hasn't anyone tried to be a superhero?\\" From here, Dave decides to buy himself a scuba suit and answer that very question by creating his alternate persona...Kick-Ass.<br /><br />The film is based on a comic book series of the same name from author Mark Millar, who has also had a hand in The Ultimates, Marvel Zombies, and the recent Civil War story arc in Marvel Comics. While I haven't read the series myself, I'm told that the film adaptation is a nice translation which holds onto the core of the comic books.<br /><br />It's within this translation that we stumble upon my first, and possibly only, gripe with Kick-Ass. Being a huge fan of Batman and all things in the respective Bat-universe, I was very upset to see such a blatant rip-off of the Batman costume being worn by Big Daddy. While other costumes in the film are at least close to their comic book counterparts, Big Daddy is nowhere near close. What we get instead is imagery of a Batman-looking character blowing people away with a variety of firearms. This upsets me for two reasons: 1) Batman doesn't kill. 2) Batman doesn't use guns. I don't know if the filmmakers were trying to piggyback on the success of the recent Bat-films by creating this parody costume, but I for one am not a fan of that decision. Not only does it use Batman's likeness in an inappropriate way, but it takes away from the originality of the character, as the audience will constantly be thinking \\"Batman\\" while looking at Big Daddy.<br /><br />That said, there really isn't much else to complain about with Kick-Ass. I think most people saw the previews and went in expecting a superhero comedy spoof, but that's not what they'll be getting. The movie straddles the line between spoof and superhero fantasy. At times, we're looking at the goofy side with Kick-Ass himself and Red Mist. At other times, we have a more traditional superhero narrative going on with Big Daddy and Hit Girl. It's the blurring of this line that makes the movie so intriguing.<br /><br />The characters were very fleshed out. There were many times during the movie where my heart was racing as I feared what their fate might be. The action sequences are fantastic. While bordering on ridiculous at times, the film sets a tone and stays with it the whole way through. The clear stand-out here is Hit Girl, played by Chloe Moretz. Her performance is so spot on that you'll actually believe an 11-year old girl is capable of that mentality and ability. There are lots of critics and naysayers out there complaining about the treatment of Hit Girl in the film. She's crude, incredibly foul-mouthed, extremely violent while showing little remorse, and receives her fair share of abuse as well. The critics claim that this is inappropriate and will send bad messages to a younger audience. I'm sorry critics, but in case you didn't notice, the movie's rated-R. A younger audience shouldn't be seeing this. It's called personal and parental responsibility. The same kind of responsibility people should have been showing instead of bringing their children to see South Park: BL&U just because it was a cartoon. Did Hit Girl's role in the film make me feel uncomfortable at times? You're damn right it did, and that's what the movie wanted you to feel. Huh, look at that...art making people feel emotions...what a concept.erhero fantasy. At times, we're looking at the goofy side with Kick-Ass himself and Red Mist.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book on Christmas Day, as it was one of Amazon's $5 deals. I'd heard the title before, possibly when the third book came out this summer, and decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />WOW. Wow, wow, wow. This book exceeded my best expectations. I've been an avid reader since the moment I learned how. And this book easily fits in the top 10 best books Ive ever read, and the shortlist of books I'll read more than once. I've already started rereading it, less than two days after finishing it the first time. And it's just as riveting the second time through. The premise was engaging, the writing style drew me in, and I was hooked as soon as I picked it up. I found myself so involved that I was saying \\"No!\\" out loud at crucial moments, startling my family. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.

0375826742|3.0|I've been reading Eragon since I was a lot younger. It was one of the paragons of my early excursions into the fantasy genre. When I first read this book, I remember being satisfied, though not impressed. After a recent reread, I slightly readjusted that conclusion. If you are a long time fan of the series as I was, it will deliver. If you, however, are looking for a deep book with lovable characters, an interesting plot, and a rich and full world... you won't find any of that here. There are many books that I would recommend before this one, but overall, it wasn't terrible. It's more geared toward slightly older children, as it is a lot darker and much more violent than its predecessors, but in the end, I give it 4 stars as a sequel, and 2 stars as a book in and of itself. So, 3 stars total.
0061733199|5.0|This is a fantastic book. A wealth of knowledge. I use to own the United State field manual on survival and kept it with me all the time. This book blows that one away. In fairness the army manual is geared towards reinforcing the hands on training you get. This SAS manual is about teaching. Even though I believe in practicing the skills before you really ever need them, I would say that you could probably pick this book up for the first time and reference it enough to survive for an extended period of time with no prior practice or training. I truly believe it's that good. It focuses on so many environments and scenarios. It covers preperation and planning. What belongs in your survival pack. Pretty much anything you can think of. Even though these topics are covered I would suplement this book with specialty books on field first aid and edible plants.     I would say if you can only carry one book with you at all times then this would be the one. It's not skinny. It will take up some room but it's worth it. This book and my over 10 year old leatherman are going to be passed down to my son when he comes of age. I know in time he will learn to appreciate them.

B001GCUNYO|4.0|'Taken' was originally advertised as a sort of mystery thriller about a kidnapped girl and a father who is out to rescue her, similar to Mel Gibson's 'Ransom' from over a decade ago. First thing's first - this is NOT that type of movie, and that probably is a good thing, as the advertising was genius as it seemed to draw just as many women as men, yet in the end, it would be the men that would be most satisfied.   'Taken' is really your run-of-the-mill action movie, starring Liam Neeson in an pretty standard performance as an ex-CIA father who let's his somewhat shy, pretty and fairly dorky 17 year old daughter take a vacation to Paris (played by Maggie Grace who by the way puts on a very adorable performance), yet upon arrival his daughter gets kidnapped by a gang of sex-trafficking hoodlums. Neeson's characters knows this during a pretty intense, well shot and greatly written scene as he talks on the phone to his daughter as she is being kidnapped, then boldly utters the movie's tagline: \\"I will find you, and I will kill you.\\" Up to this point, all performances are fairly stale, especially Neeson's, but what Neeson lacks in character drama he COMPLETELY makes up for as a one-man Rambo martial arts action hero. It's surprising to see someone of his age basically go all around Paris beating the living snot out of just about everyone. And I do mean everyone.     There really is no sense of mystery or intrigue as the plot is pretty straightforward and linear (to a sometimes disappointing degree), but through the good cinematography work and talented editing, it makes this physically appear more intelligent than it actually is (at only a 90 minute length, do not expect anything epic). There were some good opportunities for good plot twists that were never taken advantage of in any way, and although this is somewhat disappointing watching the film as a critic, the action, fighting, fast cars and Liam's completely bold, relentless, almost completely inhuman I-will-do-ANYTHING-to-get-my-daughter no-nonsense character will probably turn you off as much as it turns you on. He doesn't care about being a hero, he hurts and kills ANYONE who will get in his way, and the average macho-rebel wannabe will love every second of it.     Personally, I found this movie to be incredibly entertaining, and while you don't need much intelligence to watch this movie (even though at the outset it seems you will), it really doesn't matter, the bottom line is you'll be entertained just as I was. This is one of those movie's perfect for a Friday night with friends or family (well, those over 14 as there are some fairly sexually graphic scenes of kidnapped, drugged and sex-trafficked young women and men taking advantage of the, minus any nudity though, but it does come fairly close at a couple of points), it's also a movie that can be watched over and over again. I give my thumbs up!

B002GSXKN8|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my father and he loved it. He didn't have all of these movies, and the ones he had, he didn't have them on DVD (only on VHS), so now he can watch them all. This was an easy gift for a man that is insanely difficult to shop for. I'm sure the quality of the video isn't amazing, but you can't really expect HD when these movies were made 20 years ago.    My dad was happy, so I would recommend this as a perfect guy-gift. (Not to mention the really great price and free great shipping).

0971407614|4.0|This is an excellent book and if you are into bodyweight exercises then this is most likely money well spent. What is particularly excellent on the book is materials on how to vary the difficulty of an exercise and on the workout side there is something that separates this from the rest of the books I have ready about the matter. Mark Lauren makes different workout routines for different strength levels, so it is not only about repetitions or how many sets you can make. It is more about what kind of moves you are capable of. I would have liked to see some scales on the difficulty factors of the different workouts for the muscle groups. Something to kind of collect all the information and put a framework around it. Mark is quite far on that road, but there still remains some steps to take.     If there is one thing to improve on the next edition of the book, then it would be putting reference page numbers on the workout routines for easy retrieval on what to do. Meanwhile just take a pencil and mark those yourself and get to work.
B003ZK58WM|3.0|I did like this book. The period covered (1900 - 1920) is a fascinating era. In the hands of an expert writer the potential for a riveting story was huge. Overall, the book fell below my expectations. Follett weaves the story of 5 characters from different countries with significant historical events. This book is the first of a planned trilogy, and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. However, the characters were not deeply drawn and I didn't feel a strong emotional identification with any of them. Also, the interaction among the characters seems forced and the transcontinental encounters appear way to coincidental. Still, given these drawbacks, Follett frames historical events and issues in simple, understandable language. In addition, his biggest accomplishment is that the reader can easily understand the impact of these gargantuan events on daily life. The different distinctions in class structure are very well drawn. In commenting on the boook, my sub conscience may have caused me to be a little jaded in my review by comparing this work with the awesome Pillars of the Earth. In sum, if you like history, if you want a better understanding of this time period, it a good long read.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book and have personally recommended it to family and friends.  Its an easy read even though its heavy stuff and I loved that it was written through the eyes of a five year old.  Because of this though, the grammar isn't perfect and sometimes it takes a minute to fully grasp what the narrator is saying.  That may drive some people nuts but after I got into it, I didn't really notice it at all.  I read the book in 2 days, it was THAT good, I just couldn't put it down!
0515141429|2.0|Lee Child loves the word \\"shrugged\\", and doesn't like commas. Jack Reacher has the potential to be an interesting alpha male, but the Child's writing needs to improve to expand the character to full potential. To be fair, this novel was copywrited in 1997, so perhaps his later work is better.
