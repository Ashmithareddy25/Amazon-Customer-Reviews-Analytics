0307744434|5.0|Very few books manage to enchant me like The Night Circus did. I was hooked. I had to literally force myself to stop reading, and even thought it is a rather large book, I devoured it with speed and completely unaware of time carrying on around me. This book captivated me with its richly detailed world that makes magic and dreams a very real possibility. The Night Circus is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've read this year, if not the best.<br /><br />Morgenstern stitched carefully and lovingly the seams of this world. It is a magical, detailed, awe-inspiring world that took my breath away. The world of The Night Circus is a sensual suggestion, an intriguing invitation to a world that, despite being wonderfully magical, seems to be all too real. It is a testament to Morgenstern's writing skills that a circus made of magic could, for even just a second, feel real and like a possibility in real life. The world building is strong and magnificently constructed, the plot enchanting and beautifully carried out. It does get slow in some occasions, and the progress of the story is sometimes confusing due to some chapters that shift from past to present, but I felt every chapter greatly contributed to the growth of the characters, the development of the story and the characterization.<br /><br />The characters were intriguing and compelling, that goes without saying. They were mystifying individuals that I desperately wanted to know more about. Since the story is told in third person, every single character is an enigma, and while, from a perspective, that took a bit from the character development and from the connection between reader and character, it combines wonderfully with the tone of the entire book. The romance was sweet, too. I had my issues with its progression and complications, and because, at first, I though they didn't have much chemistry, but then I was swept in, completely lost in the forbidden romance between Celia and Marco.<br /><br />This book is simply breathtakingly beautiful, mysterious and wildly imaginative. The Night Circus is definitely made out of dreams. I strongly recommend it. This book is beautifully written and takes fantasy further than other common, popular books take it because of the quality of the story, the gorgeous writing and the obvious talent of the author. I look forward to see what else Morgenstern has to offer to the world, because I bet you anything, it is definitely going to be good.s simply breathtakingly beautiful, mysterious and wildly imaginative.

0451191153|5.0|I read this as a friend told me it was his favourite book, and I knew it had a controversial reputation.  I absolutely loved it! Not a typical cliche book and the story line was unpredictable.  A nice balance of love, passion and philisophy on life.  I highly recommend if you want to have an opinion on this controversial classic.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|This movie was fun, but the first Ice Age movie can't be beat.  I wanted to see them all and have now done so.  If you've not seen any of them, definitely see them in order is my recommendation.  A bit of immature humour in this one which could have been left out.
160774273X|5.0|I like the fact that the author explained his techniques well.  I will try his recipes and see how well they turn out.

B000OJFV4C|4.0|Although the show has numerous historical inaccuracies, the show is a nice diversion when compared with other dramas. Do not watch the show for historical accuracy; it you do you will be disappointed.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Well, I think I mixed up and gave my review for this one to the other.  Anyway, definitely watch the three of these in order so you can follow the development of the characters.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Even though I know little about the world of racing, this story as told from the eyes of a dog was one I could not put down until the last word. As a dog lover myself, I laughed, cried and understood. An excellent quick read!
B00992CF6W|4.0|the game is great but the gaame is two updates behind apple gets the updates on the real date. but amazon gets it about a month later. It should be 6.1 but it is stuck on 5.0
0307744434|5.0|I am pursuing a degree in Literature, and I loved this book so much that I wrote my senior thesis on this novel. It is a wonderfully old fashioned tale about a magical circus that had me hooked from the very first page. &#34;The Night Circus&#34; will have any literature enthusiast with a love for description and the merging of multiple story lines eager to finish the book in one sitting.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Exciting, Suspenseful.  If our government would only listen to our writers, events would not seen like dejavoo.  Clancey is futuristic. And his Ryan Series are the best.

B003Y5H5JM|5.0|Just love this movie.  The &#34;extras&#34; are worth watching before seeing the movie, so you understand the background and how they put it all together.  Superb performances.
B001Q94TQA|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. Glen handsard is amazing. I got it under one week. very great quality!
B009329ZF2|4.0|I liked the movie very much but then that is the type og movie that i would buy. I watched it twice.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It lets you draw any way you want with fire and water. I like that you can redraw your stickman. I love it!
B006T5C5PS|4.0|I enjoy this book.  It gives you all the info to begin a healing journey.  It is not easy, nor is it a simple cure all pill.  This life style takes work and commitment, but with wonderful results.  I do not have cancer, but I believe preventive measures can do wonders.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|First, let me say that The Lost Hero is a exalent book. But I also have to say that I thing that Rick Riordan went a little to far with the boyfriend/girlfriend show. He diden't have to get that real. He could have said:Piper Miclean liked Jason Grace. End of story. I think the Percy Jackson  through the Heros of Olymypus are really good books. But, I would not recommend it for nine or ten year olds.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took a while to get into but once I did the twists and turns were unimaginable...I highly recommend this book.
B002BWP49M|5.0|This was a great addition to the series. It kept a lot of the feel from the book. I love seeing these on blu-ray especially the forest scenes and the wedding. I can't wait to get the last one!

B0002E5O9G|5.0|Of all the performances of this great work, this one is my favorite musically.  The recent movie version contains the best acting, but this recording is the BEST musically.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I read this after reading Gone Girl.  It is quite scary and Libby Day still shows up in my disturbing dreams.  That said I couldn't put it down and I can't wait for the next Gillian Flynn offering!
B00328G4V6|3.0|Like the cop on South Park says: &#34;Nothing to see here.&#34; For those songs here that were done on previous collections there isn't any version that wasn't done better elsewhere. It's interesting from a historical perspective and it is passable. Let's face it: after 40 years can there be anything Hendrix did that hasn't been released that could be of interest? Probably not.
B00A12VJZM|4.0|I picked this up back during the holidays when it was on sale for $5.99.  It's a great collection with three discs worth of great Stones classics.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Its a very handy app to know the battery life, it also gives you a good break up of what activities activities you can do. I thought its little expensive 2$. Funny thing is it never shows 100%.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun it's exactly like temple run but with trains and Hoover boards and a fat policeman chasing you instead of giant monkeys

B005IZLPMY|5.0|If you want an action filled heroic type movie this is it! And I love that it is clean, no foul language or love scenes.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|thank you it was great  i love that movie i lost my movie so i wanted a new one i love merle streep
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a departure from Grisham's normal books. I have always been a fan, but this was one of his best books in a long time. I am not usually surprised at the plot of a book, but this kept me guessing through most of the book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The way the author captures the narrator's thoughts is amazing and the way the book is written sets is apart from the rest.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This was always one of my favorite stories.  I'm very glad that I now have it in a more portable fashion.

B00AQ71FLK|2.0|It felt like the kind of games I played on my PC 20 years ago.  That and games that require I rapidly pound the &#34;hit&#34; button/key/area...isn't my idea of entertaining ameplay.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie is clever. It is funny. It is different. It appeals to an older audience but I think everyone can connect. A gem.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Is it going to look for an update every time I start it?  It  never finished loading... so I actually can't say much about the game play.  I'm too busy to wait and couldn't even (apparently) read while I waited... as it started the download over when I returned.  Maybe it's a good game... but I never got to find out.
B001DCQI8W|4.0|There are always pros and cons to integral sets like this one. On the one hand, you by definition get a single vision of a composer's works in this or that form. On the other, by further definition you wind up with a vision that may not incorporate the most satisfying one of any single piece in the set. I suppose that would all be certainly true of any Bruckner symphonic set -- at least, it is for me. I've never stumbled across any full cycle by one conductor that I've found entirely satisfying, including this one by Karajan. Oh, these are certainly good performances in the main, though I think they get better as you move up the number list -- or, if you want to take the opposite perspective, they get less good as you slide earlier and earlier in Bruckner's symphonic output. Allowing for the fact that there are different versions or editions or whatever you want to call them -- \\"Hey, these notes aren't quite the same over here!\\" -- for the various symphonies, the fact is that in the early going, up through Symphony No. 3, I prefer, say, the renditions conducted by Tintner on Naxos, with a further possible preference for Inbal in the No. 3. Karajan's recordings of these works seem a bit over-grand to the point of becoming creaky. (Is such a thing possible for Bruckner? Yes, I think it is.) To my untrained ear, Karajan's set comes into its own with the No. 4, which is done in fine fashion but which also suffers from what I to be consider superior competition from Jochum with the Berlin Philharmonic and Klemperer with the Bavarian Radio Symphony. It's with the No. 5 that Karajan's renditions begin to assume the role of top dog, and though I do like Klemperer's version of the No. 6 with the New Philharmonia I'm quite happy to ride Karajan from that No. 5 all the way home. So as I said at the start, my reaction is mixed. I'm keeping my Tintner's for early going, but this budget reissue of the Karajan cycle is a fine one that's a keeper as well, though it suffers from theusual budget box flaw of having two symphonies (Nos. 5 and 8) spread over two discs.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I LOVE Arrow!!!:)<br />I wasn't sure at first if I would like it but took a chance and now it's my favorite show!!!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I hadn't seen the movie when I ordered this, but the music is so beautiful and haunting and I love listening to is. I would highly recommend it to people who enjoy good music.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am addicted to this game I really cant put it down.  if they make it better I will be fired.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Even though it got only so so reviews, I like it very much. I first rented this movie, then decided to buy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am a fan!  Really enjoyed Bared but feel as though Reflected was equally as great.  I liked Eva much better toward the end of the book when she finally developed some confidence in herself and her relationship with Gideon.  Cannot wait for Entwined, it will be interesting to see how Day evolves the story to an ending.  Even if it's a book filled only with scenes of the undeniable chemistry between Gideon and Eva, that will be enough of an ending for me :)
B00A8ZZ570|2.0|I must confess that I purchased this because I was starving for sideman pianist Taborn's material.  Imagine my disappointment.  While I suppose this is up-to-par ECM level output, I have heard all these sax riffs before.  This is one step above smooth jazz. I realize this is his first ecm solo outing, but I think he totally blew it by grabbing the spotlight and being wholly undemocratic with the timeline, not to mention the decibel levels.
B00846REIS|5.0|This, by far, is my favorite series.  I like reading Sylvia Day's writing, she does a good job of engaging you as a reader and sets the story for all of the characters.  The story was nail biting and very sexxxxxy!  Totally loved Gideon and Eva was a good character as well but her lack of confidence was irritating at times creating the bulk of the angst of the story.  Very, very hot couple.  If you haven't tried it yet, don't hesitate, great series!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|If you liked American Horror story Season 1 Murder House, you need to have this set. I've watched several episodes many times and my wife, who did not watch the series when aired, liked it also.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded the Pinterest app a few days ago on my Samsung smartphone.  I enjoy the ease of use.  Now I can actually pin things right when I see them instead of trying to remember where to find them later when I have &#34;free time.&#34;
B005IQZB14|5.0|Well presented adventure and life changing experience. She really takes you with her along the trail, inside and outside. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is a great fun game for all ages and what makes it better is that it is a free game and I love it
0385738765|5.0|WOW!  And I thought the first book was good.  I enjoyed all the twists and turns of this second book.  Rarely is a second book as good as the first, but this one met the mark.  James Dashner writes for younger readers, but he can keep older readers enthralled with his books.  I immediately bought this book right before the first one ended ... and then I bought the last two right before this one ended.  I like the way one book continues immediately where the previous one left off.  I have to say, this series was the first books I have read by Dashner, but they definitely won't be the last.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Excellent dvd, the best band in the world meets the precursors of Blues in Chicago. Great picture quality and sound.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|An outstanding conclusion to a great series.  I think that James Dashner is going to the top of my list of favorite authors.  His books are compelling and keep the reader so interested that I read instead of doing many things that I had to do.  I couldn't wait to read the final book ... and then I immediately started the fourth book in the series, the prequel.  Great writing ... gives great reading.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is gr8 i met a awesome person her restaurant is called eateateat and whats the hubba about money hey at least they ask
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you enjoy dystopian drama, or sci-fi that is more about story and character than tech-speak, do yourself a favor and give Wool a try.  I'm usually wary of the cheap Kindle reads, having been burned by awful writing and flimsy stories.  Wool is fantastic - gripping and suspenseful, with fascinating characters.<br /><br />My only gripe, and it is a TINY one, I assure you, is that ****SPOILER ALERT****  that you get invested in some characters that are taken out of the story entirely, pretty early on.  The \\"real\\" main character doesn't show up for awhile. (Now that I think about it, it is probably because what feels like one book to me is actually 5 separate books sold as a package.  So I'm a little slow on the uptake here!)<br /><br />****OKAY, IT IS SAFE TO READ AGAIN NOW.  That is a tiny, eensy-weensy gripe, not even a gripe really, more of an observation, and by no means should dissuade you from reading Wool.  Seriously.  Do it now.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game could have been good but I felt the developer pushed their product too hard. Every other button you press leads to a sales attempt, and the program is designed to make those purchases a little too easy. I wasted .49&cent; on this piece, (shame on me) ...the dev. gets to swallow my two cents in return.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|A good old fashioned mystery, sharply written, great characters and a suspenseful puzzle. I'll need to get the early stories now.
B002EPWTLC|5.0|This DVD is very good. I like it very much. Besides the music performance It is nice to see also the so living enthusiasm of the audience.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Awesome box set. Has many good Beatles hits one song skips but who cares its an awesome box set! Here's what my dad has 2 say: I agree-in addition, the sound quality is pristine-the bonus Dvd on the making of the albums is a great history of how the Beatles progressed artistically and sonically-you will love this set
B002SYXCVK|5.0|I had some bonus bucks, so the timing was right for this really easy to listen to Christmas album by Sting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So awesome much better than temple run 1. It has amazing features like mines and rivers and even ziplines. Best app ever reccomend to u and your freinds

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I recently started to going to  the gym and I was lost first couple of weeks without knowing what exactly I should target for. I bought the kindle edition of this book and couldn't get away from the book till read to the end!<br /><br />Every detail in this book is clear and easy to understand. You will learn everything what you must know to get best out of your time , money and effort . Joining is just part of the story and rest will come from this book, and good thing is its not waste your time ! Short and easy reading but you will know everything that you should know about relevant topics.<br /><br />TO LEARN ALL THESE THINGS FROM YOUR \\"PT\\" YOU MAY HAVE TO SPEND AT LEAST 5-10 SESSIONS WHICH COULD COST YOU A FORTUNE !<br /><br />I read this book and it helped me to save my time , money and effort by effectively planning my journey towards goals.<br /><br />AND THIS IS NOT A THEORY BOOK LIKE MOST OF THE AVAILABLE BOOKS ON THIS TOPIC. ITS A PLAN YOU COULD START FROM DAY ONE! ITS ALL ABOUT KNOWING THE REQUIRED FACTS BEFORE YOU START YOUR JOURNEY.<br /><br />I am so glad I read this book before be late and end my journey with disappointments, thank you Mike !

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had me hooked. I was surprised at how clever the story was and how tightly it came together. Nicely done. While it's not my usual style, I was happy I bought it.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Ms. Mead did an awesome job writing these amazing series. Rose is strong female character plus she is very loyal to those loves. She is a very likable heroine.

B008AT71WI|5.0|I'm not going to rate the movie, either version (you get both on this bd).  I will say that whether you prefer the original or the director's cut, both are included, and both look absolutely incredible.  This is a top notch transfer.<br />The extras are also great.<br />If you like Little Shop of Horrors, you need to have this great edition in your collection.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|What can I say? &#34;I am a Trekie&#34;!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This one was both unique and captivating.  It was a difficult story for the narrator to have to tell, due to his position in the story.  I thought the surprise ending was excellent and worth waiting for.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is a fun app. I love how you can keep trying for new goals, trophies, and levels. The only part of My horse that I do not like, is how if takes so long to load. I would have rated the app with five stars, but it is simply just ridiculous. on how long it takes to load.  It is good other wise though
B00AREIAI8|5.0|loads of fun. a little slow running on the kindle but any kid would have a blast. gems are easy to get too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the best book in the series. It has interesting characters, a plausible plot, and there was romance accompanying the explicit sex.  I loved this book.
B000BMYWYC|4.0|heres another glue that has its places in the model world. one jar will last me a year , but it has its uses sometimes.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I greatly enjoyed playing the game. Had no trouble downloading to my Kindle Fire and playing. Did have one time in a HO spot that it was running slow so I just got out of the game and went right back in. No problem. A little bit tiring having to run back and forth to different spots to pick up needed items&hellip;but that is usual in G5 games. Has great hint button.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like subway surfer but its kind of like temple run and the people cost to much.I also like the goals the broads and I like that it is in a subway with the trains.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Loved the story and the history lesson of World War II. I CAN'T WAIT FIR THE THIRD BOOK IN THE TRILOGY!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very good app It 's one of my favorite apps in my dock. I just got the app yesterday,best of all,  IT 'S FREE!!!  totally worthy of downloading.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This cover is great. Does what it say it will-good color selection so you can customize your device. Much better quality than the knock off on Ebay. Worth the $.
B0053O89IS|5.0|The item came rapidly and in excellent codition.  It was also a good price and a fair value in my opinion.

B00AE4OGCU|5.0|A truly sublime trilogy. Outstanding characters and blissfully adventurous storyline. Feisty. Brutal. Potent. Unforgettable. Enchanting to the very last paragraph.
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|Stick with your memories of the series and first movie. This is not worth viewing, Carrie becomes such a hateful selfish witch, it's painful to watch.
B0000X61VE|5.0|My favorite workout video!  This is a fun workout so you don't realize you are working as hard as you are.<br />You will probably be sore the next day.
B004SIP7XK|5.0|The perfect price, arrived fast. a great movie. Recommend everyone to watch this movie. Very good cast, direction, and storyline.

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend.
B004D20JP2|5.0|This short of Peter and the Wolf is exquisite.  The figures are incredibly alive; I didn't know it was possible to make movements in stop-animation so subtle.  Some of the human faces near the Uncanny Valley, but they do not fall into it.  Peter and the Wolf in particular have extraordinary, almost uncanny blue eyes.  Peter's are luminous, and incredibly expressive in a very understated but powerful way; I have no idea how they get that effect.  The Wolf has a tremendous presence of his own.  The aesthetic sways uncannily but not disorientingly between dark and playful.
B000046PVN|4.0|The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend.
B00456PKG4|4.0|This movie was very entertaining - good story line with some humor and good action scenes - well worth the 1.99 price.

1619692376|5.0|Wasn't too sure in the early going, but after about the 4th chapter I was hooked.<br />Great story, great imagination from Baldacci
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game reminds me of Mario for super nintendo years ago.  love it! I haven't found anything wrong with it yet
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I find myself playing this little game more often than expected.<br />It is a fun blast to play when you have a few minutes to kill and don't want to use your brain.<br />The graphics are retro 80's and look straight out of the arcade.<br />The music is entertaining and adds to the fun.<br />I would recommend this little racer.
B009C643OC|5.0|o don't know how this app will be I played the first one and it was fool and this one looks better I would buy it!!!
1250027624|5.0|If you are a &#34;Downton&#34; fan then this is a wonderfully written book. The pictures alone make this a worthwhile purchase and a possible coffee table book as well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it. this app is awesome. I have always wanted a horse and now I have one. I just love it. I cant think of the right words to say completely how much I love it.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I purchased this for a friend's 50th birthday when I discovered she LOVED the movie and it was no where to be found locally.<br />To order from some of those &#34;other stores&#34;, would actually have cost less, this came wrapped new, had extended features, it was all great and the friend was pleased.<br />Job well done!
B001223BLU|5.0|frankie valli and the four seasons are one of the greatest groups of all time and i own everyone of thier cds and i play them often
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|great game really makes you think some times. also good grafics. wish it was longer. will play again on harder level
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is really good you should get it because it has a lot better graphics and controls than the first one
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Once I started reading the series, I had trouble putting it down.  Couldn't hardly believe such sexual activities actually took/take place.  I am 70 years old and was 'shocked', but not enough to discontinue reading the entire series.
B009PAETCG|5.0|great. handling real feel and great fun third. tubing. hinl<br /><br />fruiterer. ones. o. bghh. hy. hhggb.  ygvg.  vgffg ghggf defji bjbhg. kingdom ddecg hugged vg. g g ff c c.  c Dc.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun enough to play once in a while. It's not an awesome app, but good enough and it's free. I recommend in for those who want to pass the time but don't want to get caught up in it for hours.
B002LBKDYE|5.0|One of those videos that you probably don't want to spend time watching - but really can't afford to not see.<br /><br />Our 'food system' has some problems - and those issues affect you every day.<br /><br />This is a 'must see' for anyone who eats - and that pretty much includes you!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game because, you don't have to wait to long for your money and lives to top up, and it Carrie's on working whilst your not playing.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|For some reason, Season 2 left us feeling flat compared to Season 1. Maybe the concept of the show got old to us, but we stopped watching after a couple of episodes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A lot of fun and very good graphics. They give you a lot of different things you can do. Very addictive.
B00170I7GG|5.0|Perfect family movie for Feb 2. Kids and I really enjoyed it.<br />eight more words required. eight more words required
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My son loved getting up every morning and making his new lego.  This was easier and cheaper then buying little gifts that get tossed or sugary candies he shouldn't have each day.  It will be our new family tradition.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A few times I felt it was a bit of a pain to run into rooms so far away from each other to complete objectives. It would have been impossible without the hints. That being said, I found this particular game to be a great play length and very entertaining.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I've been listening to this over and over again.  I've also listened to other les mis soundtracks, this is the best.  The orchestration backing up the singers is powerful, even thunderous.  The cast of other soundtracks have singers who by necessity broadcast over an audience.  The movie soundtrack not having that limitation has much more feeling and emotion.  Russell Crow who everyone has type cast as the gladiator and closed minded to a singing role for him nevertheless fills the role more than adequately, even matching or exceeding Hugh Jackman.  The best singing is the younger members of the cast.  But again Jackman pours in so much feeling that I can't help listening over and over again.  Also if your closed minded by what Anne Hatheway has done before, you will miss her powerfully moving performance.
B00004WG2F|4.0|I bought this disk as a birthday present for my wife, an adaptation of a Jim Harrison novel which is, in my very humble opinion,<br />an American literary masterwork. The movie, although quite good, and an abiding love story, only fails a bit in comparison to the book. That flaw is mine, not the film's. I am not as visual as my wife. Too late to learn?<br />There is a small section that will disturb some, but it is of war, and what that particularly insane manner of behavior can pulse<br />and twist and echo in its survivors. Brad Pitt, everyone's supernaturally handsome star, captures that rage beautifully--a handsome demon worthy of Poe.<br />On my wife's behalf I'll add a fifth shadow star. She knows an enduring love story when she sees one. Makes why she married me such a mystery. Mind the voice of One Stab, the narrator: a gift to both the book and the film. We exist at the mercy of this rock we live on and the only certainty is our own impermanence. You can feel that in this story.
B00170I7GG|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I laugh everytime I watch it.  I recommend watching this movie every year around the first of February.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Love the Harry Bosh series!  Great detective work and good story to go along. Looking forward to his next adventure!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not the great American novel but great fun to read. Well-crafted by establishing characters quickly, then moving to the sensual passages. It definitely lived up to the hype. Surprisingly I did not find it to be exploitative of women. I did have to giggle at the over-use of \\"Oh my!\\", as it made me want to hear George Takei do a dramatic reading of the book. All in all, lots of sexy fun.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Have zero complaints. So far anyway. Need friends though so feel free too add me Gameloft ID mamabear87 I play every day and will gift! :)
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This isn't going to challenge Moby Dick as an American classic, but it was quite simply a fun read. The sex scenes were handled especially well, making it tempting to skip the rest. But this book did a nice job of fleshing out the central male character while keeping the reader's pulse racing.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|I own three CDs from Two Steps from Hell, and I would have to say that in just a couple of days time that this has become my favorite of them all!  In particular, the first track 'All's Hell that Ends Well' definitely does serve as the orchestra's theme song; in explores every facet of what they are good at doing, and that is making epic music.  This is most definitely worth your money, whether you get the MP3 download or the CD.
B008B92U32|3.0|This idea has been around for a while, but I have seen better apps in terms of UI.  It's not intuitive so there's a lot of trial and error instead of showing you what this is and what it does.  And more importantly, this is how you do it.  Like I said before, it needs work.  Not all is bad, though.  The feathering is one of the best I've seen so this app has a lot of potential...
B000V7H7HG|3.0|Pieces are hard to keep together. For the money, I was expecting better assembly.we kept it anyway but would have purchased differently if I had known this defect.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|Any movie that keeps my little boy's attention for more than 5 minutes is alright by me! I am also ok watching it over and over again, a little eye candy for mama never hurts when it comes to a movie for the kids.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|Great film and highly underrated.<br />The story offers a fictional account of the seminal event that touched off the 2008 stock market collapse.<br />Margin Call contains a galaxy of talented stars that grab and hold your attention for the length of the film.<br />Not only would I watch again, I would highly recommend to any movie lover.<br />Best part: free instant video when you have Amazon Prime!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Stupid app stopped working. I liked it at first but it just goes back to the home screen! What a waste!!!!!!!! Don't get temple run 2 for your kindle fire (even if it is free)!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Outstanding! Loved the first one, but the graphics in this one are incredible! Got my daughter hooked on it too.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|Soooo beautiful!  Dress is perfect in detail.  Doll has a pretty face.  All the accessories come with the doll.  You will be very happy with this purchase.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Good action film. Cast was very good, interesting narrative in the movie Blake Lively's character's point of view.  Surprise ending was pretty good also. Taylor Kitsch is great in this film. Way more intense than he was in Friday Night Lights.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is great even though the picture gets very busy sometimes and it is kinda hard to concentrate,but it is getting better once you get used to it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played this game on my IPhone 3gs it was very glitchy they did put out a fix. Was glad to see it for the kindle fire hd great graphics fun game
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book isn't an easy read. It's violent, profanity-laced, and real. But that's what war is. Chris Kyle loved it and paints a realistic picture for us. The writing isn't superb, and the book could be more organized, but none of that really matters because the real meat of the story is Kyle's charisma. Say what you want to about the man, but you cannot question his patriotism, his work in the field, and his dedication.<br /><br />American Sniper is easily one of my favorite military biographies. When I heard the news of his murder yesterday, 2/2/13, I can honestly say that I grieved the loss of a true American patriot. We could use a few more like him these days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a interesting game and can lead to hours of fun. If your looking for a fun game this is the game for you.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My grandaughter likes the game. Grooming, feeding, making treats, ang cleaning the stable are her favorite activiteis - too bad it is not real life!!  Took a LONG time to download for some reason.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers Rio is a delightful diversion on a snowy day. The sunny graphics and summery beach scenes are wonderful escapism in the middle of the winter. So far, I have unlocked two characters, and can't wait to unlock more!
1401232590|5.0|Great story and one of the first to really showcase the powerful yet fragile triangle between Batman Commissioner Gordon, and DA Harvey Dent. Also I loved how the took a forgetable Batman rogue, the Calendar Man and made him more viable.
B002LBKDYE|5.0|opens ur eyes to whats in ur meat that u eat.we all need to open r eyes to what is going on around us and help make a change
0060581808|5.0|Used it for an advanced ESL class, discovered it had tons of word groups:  wood, woods, trunk, branch, root, chop, axe, was one group you'd expect to find reading about life in a forest!  Another was about butchering, preserving food, etc.  It was dense information for my students, I'd rethink presentation next time.  One of my favorite books for it's description and cataloguing of life in the woods.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Just as advertised and totally satisfied and also the shipping was so much more rapid than I had expected and do appreciate that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome,it's like your really out in the wild trying to build your own home it's like real life,I'M IN LOVE WITH IT.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Just as advertised and totally satisfied and also the shipping was so much more rapid than I had expected and do appreciate that.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I bought this just after she died and I am still playing it in my car.  It is fantastic. Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a Great game.the kids love it and so do I.and the figures are so cute. Okay Bye.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Don't know how they did it, but it is just as good as Season 1. Just as suspenseful, exciting, heart breaking, and riveting. Never gets old to watch. Plenty of development for the older characters, and lots of new, exciting and mysterious characters.
1608871452|5.0|I was so excited when I received my copy of this book and it didn't disappoint. This is definitely worth buying!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Another fantastic season with plenty of twists and sub plots to keep you on the edge of your seat. Wife and I love to sit down and watch this season and the previous seasons even though we have already seen the episodes multiple times. Great storyline with plenty of character development.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our family has been following The Piano Guys since before they were even The Piano Guys.  We love watching all of their YouTube videos and we were so excited to hear that they were coming out with a CD.  This is a fantastic album that our entire family enjoys over and over again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very addicting I can't stop playing.try it out when you play it you can not stop.my opinion is this is the best app I've ever seen (played)
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I use this app for my kindle fire all the time. It's quite useful. It's very easy to use as well. I recommend for all PDF users.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a romantic comedy-drama genre film. The narrative delves into mental breakdown and the process of recovery which is carried out somewhat paradoxically with conventional and non-conventional methods.<br /><br />The story begins with the glumness of institutional care and lead character Pat Solitano Jr. receiving a hospital discharge to the supervision of his parents.<br /><br />It is the return to familiar and unresolved issues which is the foundation of events and Pat is eager to make good of the past to truly recover, but in the process he hits many walls.<br /><br />His development comes through an inadvertent commitment to bereaved Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) and a challenge to enter a dance competition, which is complemented by his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed family and their well-intended support of him. Pat Sr. is played with sharp authenticity by Robert De Niro and his wife Dolores (Aussie Jacki Weaver) is the warmhearted caregiver who somehow knows how to keep the rabble in reasonable order.<br /><br />The film contains a unique balance with self-provoked anxiety causing Pat collapses, his actions and those who care for him a source of raucous humour and the realisation love can be lost and found, which all combines to present a well-paced, tightly constructed and highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Had a different plot that you don't read in many books.<br />Good twist at the end.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|\\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" is a computer-animated family-action film. The story takes the imaginative direction of life for video game characters during their downtime with Wreck-It Ralph the lead protagonist.<br /><br />Ralph (John C. Reilly) doesn't like his bad guy role and wants to find more meaning by exploring beyond his game, and uses the shared electrical power board as a junction to other games.<br /><br />It is his voyage of discovery which introduces him to Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) and both face different predicaments in their respective games. Their coming together is the primary feature of the narrative and as a team they help not only themselves but game characters that have become redundant.<br /><br />For any viewer who played a video game in the 1980s/90s there are many familiar characters who have come on hard times and like Ralph they feel a bit disenfranchised, but he and Vanellope help them rediscover themselves, which creates some interesting game scenarios and relationships as the background stories of characters across many games provides much humour, as does their interaction because they have notably different game roles.<br /><br />John C. Reilly has the perfect deep, gravelly voice for smash hands Ralph and Sarah Silverman gives Vanellope a playful and energetic tone, which provides an enjoyable contrast between the two characters.<br /><br />It is a fun movie which is original and takes video games to a new level.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B00070QXL8|5.0|We had seen the movie several times and just had to add it to our DVD collection.  Funny great actors and amazon delivered it very quickly.....thanks a bunch.<br />Darrell
B0043X1FOK|5.0|This is a good movie for kids or adults, especially if you saw this movie when It originally came out.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just got this delivered so have not had a change to try it out....but today I will be out on location and we shall see how well it works....very nice looking and holds a bunch of stuff....looks like it's going to be a winner....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for my children and I even like to play it as well! I recommend it to everyone.
B0092MJ6B6|5.0|i got this on cassette years ago when it first came out and its great to have on digital now. after a hard day atwork, just crank it in your car on the long commute home. god i loved the 80's!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good app for all you horse lovers and for people who know nothing about horses. All around good app.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is, hands down, the best game out there, and a must have on your device.  Challenging but satisfying too. It definitely makes you think.  I hope the new levels keep coming.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is very fun and very addictive. The only down side I see is that I have to wait so long for some dragons to batch, but that doesn't keep me from playing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Rated as number one in the ongoing trials and tribulations of the amazing Agent Pentergast and supporting cast of characters. Love the other additions to the open up another storyline. KUDOS!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great Book but the reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because of the ending . I like the first book better (:
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I live by this app / program. I live being able to take sermon notes, create to do lists, keep info thru pictures, text, recordings... it is the best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is the best game I have ever played in my life and my family loves it to.
0316067601|5.0|This first-hand account of the brutal attack upon Marcus Luttrell and his fellow Navy Seals is amazing. If anyone wants to know what true heroism is, I strongly recommend he/she read this book. I've had the distinct honor and pleasure of meeting Marcus Luttrell.  He is an amazing man.  I was humbled just to be in his presence.  Since leaving the service, Marcus has continued to be someone we can all admire and respect.  His fellow Seals sacrificed everything so that we may live free!!  It was by the grace of God that Marcus lived.  Please buy this book and read, not only about the loss of his brothers in arms, but how Marcus became the...Lone Survivor.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I liked the game but I just don't like the 'notes' or whatever they are. The game has a lot of things you can buy but my most have to be bought by 'notes'. It's pretty annoying. Other than that and have to log in Facebook to get more 'notes' it's a good game.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|What a handy way to protect the Kindle and keep it clean too. It would be nice if it had a pocket to store a lens cleaning cloth, though.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I play it all the time.LOVE IT!Hope you enjoy this game also.It is very addictive so let get back to the game .<br />##PUDDING MONSTERS
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is lots of fun. it puts temple run and temple run brave to shame. its one of the more complex runner games ive played.doogiedoes
1582406723|5.0|Its interesting and does not get boring, i would recommend it to people who are interested in reading about a zombie ruled world
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the bomb!  its better than the 1 temple run. I like how they added ropes to slide on and I especially love the minecarts! this game is swasome and its FREE!!  I would totally reccomend to get this ABSOLUTELY FREE game!!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Great, continuous action in this movie, with a surprising little twist.  Love it when a &#34;Bad Boy&#34; gets to show his good side.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is cool. I really like it! Why is everything so expensive? I guess it's the economy! Oh well. Guess that's the way things have to be.
B0017XD3OY|1.0|I will say I have never read the book and did not know there was one, and maybe my review would be better if I had. This movie started slow and never picked up. It is literally the worst movie I have EVER seen. I think because it was Will Smith I expected a little more. My severe disappointment in the story and confusion throughout the movie just ruined it. This movie could have been a little better if they did not save the flashbacks for the end of the story. Maybe in chronological order it would have been better. Still there were just too many unanswered questions. Also this was basically a zombie apocalypse movie. Had I known I would have NEVER watched. My husband found it on clearance in a discount bin and now we both can understand why. Maybe if I was a zombie apocalypse kinda girl, but sadly I am more of a logical realistic type. I won't give up on Will though I was raised with his Fresh Prince shenanigans and this is the first time I have not enjoyed his acting. Though to be fair I believe the severe lack of good story and plot was the actual problem here.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|great! love the movie, would recommend. Strong female characters, great story, and -of course- a happy ending. You should rent it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I love it so much plus when you update the game you get to travel around the world like right now I am in Brazil.
B000S57KVO|5.0|Awesome set of toons for an awesome movie! It always gets me in the mood for adventure or to go cruize in my Audi R8 GT down the coast!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love the packing of this product from the box. It looks very superior. I bought it to go along with my Kindle POWER FAST charger and boy, it works to well. I highly recommend
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It is visually stunning. The story is well written. I preferred the scene where the alien spoke to the android it flowed better I thought. So when you rent it WATCH THE ALTERNET scenes at the end after the credits. Somehow all through the movie I had an aching feeling that something is missing......that just never got taken care of. Good movie worth renting not a five star but close...
B001B1CBSQ|4.0|Love this  CD took me back to my college days. I am a music lover of Ms. Hill so hearing her is always a good time.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This is a great case for my kindle!  The only issue I have is that the charging and mini-HDMI ports are not accessible when the cover is closed.  Sure I could switch it around, then the camera is not on top when I have it sitting in the case.  Other than that, definitely a good case!
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|This is a wonderful updated *and* timeless adolescent coming of age story.  The three main characters pull you into their friendship and the fortress it provides against the everyday angst of high school cliques.  Each of their lives is also complicated by their own backstory, as well, making the healing power of their friendships that much more compelling.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I thought Clint's last movie Gran Torino would be his \\"swan song\\" but I was wrong!  He's back and with a film to match although this is a bit lighter than Gran Torino.  He and Amy Adams make a good pair. She is an over-worked, stressed, and high achieving attorney and he is his same curmudgeon self.  Mickey, named after guess who? has been shuttled off to relatives while her dad,Gus, has pursued a career as a baseball scout.  There's the usual resentment brewing underneath and it all comes to a head when Mickey is pursuaded by her dad's boss to accompany her father who is losing his sight to games and help pick players for the big leagues.  There's some romance in the mix as well with Justin Timberlake playing Johnny an ex pitcher, now scout who looks up to Gus as his mentor.  John Goodman also shows up in this film as Gus's boss and as always adds another dimension to the movie.  A nice feel good movie if you like baseball and like to see the good guys come out on top!
B001R0XNSI|5.0|Beat this thing against several surfaces and it performed like a champ. Cold Steel when you need the best at a reasonable price.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have been waiting for another Harry Bosch book and this one fulfilled all expectations.  Harry is thorough and doesn't give up until a murder is solved.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|In this comedy classic, Bill Murray portrays Phil Connors, a self-centered weatherman from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is sent out on a hated assignment, with cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and producer Rita (Andie MacDowell), to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney. After doing the minimum of what needs to be done, he wakes up the next day to find out it is Groundhog Day again. Everything and everyone plays out the exact same events without knowledge of the time-loop, that is except for Phil who is now forced to re-live February 2 indefinitely.<br /><br />The film works in more than one way. While the repeated events of one day are exploited for comedic effect throughout most of the movie, there is more going on. After Phil is forced to deal with the same people and situations over and over again, his character develops and by the end of the movie he is a changed man.<br /><br />Groundhog Day is a true classic and highly enjoyable.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Glad I could find these rather than replace my Voyager Pro. They work flawlessly and as expected. No issues with condition or delivery.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was awesome. I especially like the end where it gives us his view of their relationship from the beginning! #LOVE!
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I am a big Keith Urban fan and own most of his CDs.  This has some great music and I really enjoyed it.
B001UW58WW|5.0|This made a great gift!  It has a lot of great songs on it, and well worth the money spent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game one of the best free games in my opinion subway surfers and jetpack joyride are the best free games
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Storyline, costuming, acting, sets all worthy of 5 stars. Rare that my wife and I both enjoy the same program equally. Downton seems to offer something for everyone. I wouldn't call it 'family friendly', only because kids might not find a lot to interest them, but although the storylines are adult oriented there is no bad language here.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the second best I app I have. Very fun. I also have Minecraft on the Xbox, and it is better on the Xbox. This is still awesome and definitely worth the few dollars I paid for it. For those of you that do not know what Minecraft is, it is a game in which you can build intricate structures on relatively vast maps. There is two modes, creative and survival. The titles explain themselves. On survival, monsters come out at night and can kill you if you do not kill them first. If I could, I would give this game 6 out of 5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So awesome crashed once &amp; I had to redownload it but cool overall. plus the mineshaft is super incredible gems are a little hard to come by and its free a definite buy.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I saw this app had a good rating and I downloaded it because it was free. In less than a week I had deleted it. I just did not see how this game was fun. There is very little variety in this game.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|The best tv show ever made. I hope they keep making it for years to come. Thomas Gibson is a great actor and leader.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I like love stories.It kept me reading and i didn,t want to puy it down I wished it would of went longer
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have really enjoed this app. I really recommend it and the first one. The problem is im really addicted
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I really like this case as it doesn't scream here I am and my Husband doesn't mind carrying it. Great.
B00992CF6W|1.0|The game is great but beware that this is NOT the most recent version.  Downloaded this to my son's phone and he couldn't hook into his sister's iPod because her version was newer.  Had to go over to Google Play Store and pay for it all over again so that they could link up.  Bummer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't imagine what it cost to produce this show.<br />The attention to detail is outstanding qnd being able to find<br />all the things must be difficult
B004HD61KE|5.0|Combining anthropology, suspense and national security makes it a 'can't put it down book!'  Looking forward to his next novel.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Made of plastic but it's a great price and it works well.  I can recommend this to anyone.<br />I would buy this again.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Characters are completely unconvincing. Holder is a definitely too young to behave the way he does. A lukewarm love story described many times before seasoned with a bit of child abuse and kidnapping....complete loss of time, bought only because the reviews were good...
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|This mic works great plugged into a camera, it's even good quality.<br />But I bought it to use with an iPad and using an adapter I can can not get the mic to work.<br />I know the adapter works because I have a head set mic that works with the adapter.<br />In fact I could not get it to work on a computer either.<br /><br />So if you are buying for a camera- yes, iPad or computer- NO!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|The first novel in the series was completely dissapointing.....but everyone was so thrilled with the series, I was hoping the second book would be better, but it was not. Everything I wrote about the first book applies also to the second...a bad mixture of Jane Austen and &#34;The story of O&#34;...
0345525558|5.0|My doctor's receptionist recommended this book.  I finally got around to purchasing and reading and agree it's a fantastic novel. I was hooked in the first few pages.  I had a hard time putting the book down and when I got to towards the end, read until early morning to finish.  I don't want to give any of the story line away, but truly believe that if you buy and read this book you will not be sorry.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|The book is to say the least, interesting. However, the main character was, to me, completely unconvincing. Too much psychology, which I understand, but because I do, couldn't understand the way the main characters behaved. Anyhow, I wasn't bored..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful show!<br />One of the best out there right now.<br />And thanks Amazon  for getting us the end of the season early!
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|I watched this film because Jennifer Lawrence usually gives a fantastic performance and I was curious even though this film comes under the classification of a semi horror film. Immediately we had the markings of past similar films that always start with less than adequate acting(yes less than her regular performance) and the old familiar lines of warning...\\"Don't go near that house,\\" etc. that a teenager can not resist. The twist at the end was in the category of ridiculous as well as all the casualties at the end, yes once again including the inept policeman that all these type films have! This could have been good, but no...sorry, it sadly was not. It IS very predictable, on the unbelievable side, and not really worth the time it takes to watch it! Apologies to all of you Jennifer Lawrence fans but I also am a huge fan and felt it necessary to give my honest opinion.
B00APJLX8E|1.0|This video did not play. Would load for several minutes. Play for 30 seconds, pause and reload. We were unable to watch it. Terrible quality. This is the first time we've tried Amazon on demand and it was terrible.  Would like a refund.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|just too short! worth the money u pay to finish the game. puzzles are challenging but the hidden objects could have more objects to find.
B002NWOOXW|5.0|But of course what else can one expect from the same writer, actors, directors, etc., etc. as those for BJ's Diary. They all clearly understood some universal characteristics in humans, and had the talent and expertise to translate it to book, script, screen play, cast and finally a gloriously shot movie.
B00APJLFEG|1.0|Really slow to start, and died (excuse the pun) from there. Just did not get any better. 45 minutes of my life I will never get back.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Many people have told me this movie was hilarious and that I had to see it.  I will admit it was funny in the beginning, but by the end it was just ridiculous and I lost interest.  I am glad that I did not waste money seeing this in the theaters.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game sucks!it is a failure!it freezes up my kindle and drains my battery! imangi studios,u suck at making good quality games
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is only missing weather or natural disasters.ive talked with others and they agree. Maybe cars to.try survival  craft for more fun like this.<br /><br />  Weather please.
B001GCUNYO|1.0|When the movie came in the mail, the package was damaged! So I went and put the movie in and it never played. Like if the disc was blank! So I called and had another one sent out here. But guess what!!! That one didnt play either! !! And yet, im still waiting for my refund!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought it was really fun but instead of trains you could have other thing like cars or people on bikes
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I didn't expect much from this game. I downloaded it for my kids but now I'm addicted to it and cant stop playing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game includes everything that was great about the last version and improved on it!! We love the new graphics and bigger, scarier monkey!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Casting was awesome. I would like to see less yabba yabba and more smashing. It's a bit too focused on Stark and I'll argue with any of you crack-head comic snobs on why Thor is the man. Great movie though.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Using the great number of sounds, keeps it from getting boring. It helps even at nap times for the elderly
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I wanted to like this movie. I tried to force myself. It is still an entertaining film - but it could have been so much more. Too many gaps in the plot. I hope for a follow-on that makes up for this.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Great competition with the younger crowd. Easy to use.the learning curve gets harder as you go further into the game
B009WJ14FA|4.0|This type of sound is hard to come by, unless you break out your old record collection. There is a nice mix of energetic and mellow songs with an old blues/rock/R&B vibe that's easy on the soul.<br /><br />Overall, a good first effort by these guys, but I think they're holding back a little, hence the four stars.<br />I look forward to the second release, when they've settled into their groove!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just in love with the series, it still maintains engaging story lines; the characters are captivating, the scenery breathtaking. Don't let the media reviews put you off season three, it's a great progression for the series.
B00001OH7N|5.0|The only way to get GOOD new music these days is to dig deep into the old stuff. I had no idea that Bowie's sound was so intense back then. The riffs on this album are amazing - good, hard, deep rock guitar sounds, mixed with some lighter lines. This 43-year-old record is a perfect example of the 1970s Rock-n-Roll sound!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I saw the 60 Mins. story. I  decided to try it out.<br /><br />I am  glad I did.<br /><br />I like the music, and his style.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really loved the last book on this series. It wraped everything up so well. I highly recommend this series to everyone!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|just very good, saw the movie first and needed to read it and was not disappointed. recommend reading that s it
0525478817|5.0|I love this book so much. I have two copies, this one and the collectors edition. This copy I bring everywhere with me and let everyone borrow/share with their friends. Brilliant.
0765325950|5.0|Action, romance, magic, the end of the world. What more could you ask for? This book was a fitting and wonderful end to a great series.
B0054SMID0|5.0|First off, watched this with my amazon prime account, streamed very well.<br /><br />Now to the movie itself, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.  If you enjoy courtroom movies, this is a must see. A great plot. Somewhat predictable at points (but at others you have no idea what to expect). You may be able to see a scene unfolding, but you may not understand how it's going to get from A to B. If you have prime, definitely a must watch, if not - rent it!
B009JBZH54|5.0|got for my mom. she loves the movies. good to have all three in one set.  i havent watched them all yet. but good to have on disc.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Create game but I wish it could be updated on the kindle fire  If it could be updated on the kindle fire it would be even better
1451673442|5.0|What caught my eye was the look of the book but once I got it home and started reading it I fell in love with it.  If you are a fan of Rhonda's then this is a must have.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|FAST MOVING ADVENTURE. I LIKED USING 3 OTHER CHARACTERS FROM HIS MILITARY DAYS, I REALLY LIKED IT<br />TROUBLE IS GREAT
B0017HEX76|3.0|Don't get me wrong...I love the movie!  What ticked me off is the fact the sender did not disclose the fact the talking is in Japanese.  The only reason I did not send it back is because there isn't that much talking...if there was more talking I would have sent it back for sure.  Again LOVE THE MOVIE.  It is one of the best ways to introduce a child to classical music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A fun game that is increasingly challenging.  Like the way one can advance to next level by shopping. A real good buy!
158270208X|5.0|When I saw this book I had to have it...it is beautiful and matches the Magic.  If you have one you should have the other and it might be a good idea if they were to be sold as a set also not just as single books.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|There are flaws in this film, for sure, but it remains one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, and one of my favorite movies period. [Are you supposed to write the word &#34;period&#34; or just put one at the end of the sentence?]<br /><br />From the fantastic score running under the opening credits to the ridiculous final image at the very end of the movie (was that redundant?), it's just a whole lot of fun.  The cornfield sequence is worth the price of admission alone, and for me it's one of THE iconic American film clips. Don't miss the auction scene, either.
067144901X|5.0|This is my son's favorite and my favorite of the Sandra Boynton books.  We have almost all of her books, now, thanks to this one.  It's simple, funny and easy for a baby and/or toddler to follow.  The pictures are simple enough to not be overwhelming, but detailed enough to allow you to have a few things to point out to your child while you read it to him/her.  Plus, despite the fact that I've read this book to him at least a hundred times, I still actually like the book.  That's worth a lot.  He LOVES books and has a ton of them, but he still will go and pick out this one to read.
B003Y5H556|1.0|Wow, probably the worst movie of the genre, and that's saying something in a genre that encompasses such trash as the Twilight movies and Harry Potter.  I bought it because it was cheap, but now wish I'd spent that $6 on a beer at the bar.
B0093DNRY6|2.0|This CD is just awful.  Maybe I will get used to it...like a jack hammer just outside my window.  I bought this cd on a whim while on the Amazon site.  I really like Brad Meldau and the Bad Music was listed as a MP I might like...not.  It's like kids banging on pots and pans.  There are nine songs on the cd and they are all awful.  It's like a night at The Roxy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have loved every episode of this show since season 1. It is always entertaining for the beginning to the end of the show!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita's experience was very hearting warming and reasuring that we are loved unconditionally by our Heavenly Father.  Have read similar books and each person's has an amazingly personal recognition of their experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a cute game! I've always wanted my own horse and this is as close as I'll probably get to having my own.
0425252868|5.0|After listening to the author on the radio describe his book, I decided to buy it.<br />I was intrigued how these two individuals from two different countries were able to serve their air forces and when one had the opportunity to destroy the other he made a  moral judgement to let that crew live.<br />It was an excellent human interest story.<br />If you enjoyed &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; by Marcus Luttrell you will definitely like this book also.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and gained much insight and knowledge into &#34;The Language of Flowers.&#34;  I am happy that there was somewhat of a happy ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 7year old granddaughter just loves playing with this horse  game. She is all into horse back riding in real life so when she can't be with the real thing she is playing  this game. So if it can keep a 7 year old busy and happy it deserves a 5 star rating<br />I'm
B006LSZECO|1.0|I had debated about purchasing this book and should have listened to my gut.  I am not a fan of Gone Girl.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Im sure that this program has it's uses but running on my laptop was not one of them. I downloaded the full version of flash instead and never looked back
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved reading the trilogy.  Felt a little guilty reading them, but can honestly say I started the first book and continued until I had read all three!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Absolutely love this game! Bought it for my little brother, but I play it more often than he does. I love the competition and simpleness of the game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|perfect casting, and beautifully filmed.  Best show on TV in my opinion.  This is what drama is supposed to be.
B009R6GN22|5.0|riveting,  well  researched and well written.  One of those books you cannot put down and look forward to reading every day.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Following two outstanding season, Season 3 is going to be the best of all.  Hope we can look forward to many more seasons.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|If you want to know about Men In Black 3, just replay Men In Black 1 in your head, tack on a &#34;touching&#34; ending - and there you have it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great way to spend time. games are short and fun to play. makes you think sometimes!  definitely works your hand eye coordination.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|it is perfect over all , love the shipping time and the product it self, good seller to buy from
B000A0K2JO|1.0|I plugged it in, it didn't play. I am planning on returning it. I was using it to save a USB port.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I chose this rating because the game is just awesome<br />Like<br />EVERYBODY<br />No more words requried<br />buy the game no regrets
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it amazing graphics, different colors on different horses, and it teaches responsibility. The only thing I'm disappointed with is that it's only Quarter Horses, Unicorns, and a Zebra.
B006LSZECO|1.0|did not like this novel...could not deal with it until pages and pages..was going to delete many times...<br />Will not read any more by this writer!<br />Really depressing and no redeaming qualities in the charactors!<br />Sorry did not like!!
B0053O89IS|5.0|I bought this for someone else and she just loves it.  The price was the best I could find.  I would buy again from here.
1579128955|5.0|looking at this book with your child can bring up many question, much conversation and learning.  i recommend it highly.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a must for your kindle fire.  Tells you exactly how much battery you got for reading, videos, games etc.  A must and its free
0517543052|5.0|are you going to like this book?  how on earth am i supposed to know?  but i certainly enjoy perusing it. it has 3 sections, and of course my favorite is the brown pages full of art and profundity.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Short and to the point: This album is their best. It's better than White Pony. It's better than Diamond Eyes. There are no bad songs, and the best songs on here are their best ever.
0307341550|5.0|If you're going on a long flight and you want the hours to whip by, then pick up \\"Sharp Objects\\". It is that good. I also read \\"Gone Girl\\" which was magnificent and totally different. About to start \\"Dark Places\\" and I'm already lamenting the departure of Gillian Flynn from my life.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|very entertaining, love the action.  Also how they don't have him win every time.  Hope it is back for another season
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the only tihing wrong is. it sometimes shuts off its own. very. fun game to play my neice and I play it together
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fantastic game and I love the game itself... My favorite part about the game is that I get to try to complete missions and get to a higher level.My brother and me have been having a competition on who can get to a higher level than each other and I won!!!!!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen  House was historical fiction which I so enjoy.  The story was based  in the the south in the late 1700s to early 1800s and involved slavery and the ways of the Southern plantations. The book moved quickly and I found that I immediately became emotionally involved with the characters and their lives during that time in American history.  The book was definitely a page turner for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really cool game not matter what age you are.  My daughter made me play it and now I am addicted to it.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This was an interesting movie, we liked it but not quite as much as expected.  Ths special effects were good.
B00962341U|5.0|The CD arrived fast and just in time for Christmas considering it's not sold in the United State of America.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evermore helps me stay on top of things. I can keep up with all my lists at home or on the run. its a must have.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Excellent book. Zero Day was an intriguing mystery and held my interest throughout. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery/thriller.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Don't put this on your iPad!  It's just as hard to read as in college or high school, but without Cliff notes!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I.m really excited about the third book. I was curious about the author would be able to create more intrigue after the near finality of the first book. However, she successfully picked up the second storyline and connected it with the last one. I was planning to wait to use my prime credit next month on it, but I.m hooked and will be purchasing it immediately.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  I have season 1 & 2.  Season 3 is just is as good if not even better.  I sure did not expect to see what happen from the last viewing.  Can't wait to see tonight's show.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|The rare good deal direct from apple.  This adapter is well made and small, almost too small to keep track of!
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|I am a huge fan of the first 3 entries of this series.  The first time I watched this,  I had to go back and verify that I watched PA4 and not one of the knockoffs by the asylum.  I don't understand how something like this was made.  It is time to put this franchise to rest if they put out garbage like this.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Amazing everything....sound quality, picture quality, performance. Absolutely love it. One of the best concert dvds I have out of my whole entire rock collection.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Hours of fun. Definitely recommended for ages 6 to 10.  I really enjoy it. Can't wait for the next version.
B009HNDCC4|4.0|This is a great part of Amazon. I recently cancelled my Netflix after I found out about Amazon Video. It is cheap and they always have up to date TV and movies. I would like it even more if more TV shows are included with Amazon Prime membership
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Share your love for horses while raising and taking care of your very own horse! You can even name it! Be a pro equestrian in no time!
B004P1JEWU|5.0|If you were sucked in to the story in the first two books, this third instalment will leave you gasping for more! Murder, mayhem, political machinations - it's all there and keeps you turning the pages late into the night. A definite &#34;can't put down&#34; book. Luckily, I was on holidays when I read it or I may have had to contemplate a couple of sickies so there were no rude interruptions to this gripping tale.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's a great game to pass the time away. I would  rate this game 5 stars any day of the week. You can do things at your own pace.
0425263916|5.0|I have read this book three times. I can't wait for the third book to come out. A lot like Fifty Shades.
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|Great CD, listening to it right now! Music is really FUN, and it is an excellent sounding CD.<br />Joe is a guest with this group, this is pretty much Tal's CD. Just think 70's funk!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is totally awesome I love it! Also it is so cool but I'm going to rate it a five because of its awesomeness!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is very addicting. The best thing about it is that there is many updates and u get to run in many places. I would REALLY prefer that you get this app. It is the best game I have ever played.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers!!! And I luv the  way they put a twist to it! I will be playing this  game for the rest of my life it is awesome! Maybe you should come out with a subway suffers two....
B0098460O4|5.0|These two sing beautifully together and I am quite impressed. I think he has the potiential to be better than Pavarotti.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games ever. If u ever need anything to do in your off time off time or just hanging around,this is the game to get. Caution it may get extremely addictive.
0060763280|4.0|The book Secrets of the Mmillionaire Mind is a good guide for the pursuit of success and wealth. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I had seen a &#34;60 Minutes&#34; segment on Rodriguez. It was fantastic to see the whole story in this documentary. Part mystery, part feel-good story, all terrific movie. Makes me want to meet him. And I'm definitely going to buy some of his music.
B008B92U32|3.0|Does what it says, but nothing more.  Can be kinda hard to adjust the red boxes that move the faces.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|I loved this cute tale about Monsters vs Humans! Very good HD quality on my new larger Kindle Fire HD, too!
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Carole King is a legend and Tapestry is legendary.  After all these years I saw the MP3 album for $2.99 on Amazon and decided it was about time to add it to my collection.  Amazing music, delivered with soul and precision, by an amazing artist.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is an excellent documentary. The story is incredible and they tell it well. After I saw it, I went straight to my computer and purchased the soundtrack. I have a feeling you will too. See it!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Graphics are beautifully done and enjoyed the mini puzzles throughout. Only reason not five stars is because you have to pay to get the full game.
0385040253|4.0|This book is an icon, benchmark, standard by which others are measured. Many drawings and explanations, almost too much to digest.....but is good for those without any idea of knots or cordage and for those who want to expand thier knot lexicon. Recommend it highly!
075669812X|5.0|I bought this for my nephew for his birthday which is actually Christmas day! When he opened his other gifts he was saying something about not having this special green ninjago. He freaked out when he opened this book and saw the green character! If you have a ninjago obsessed person on your gift list, this present is a must!
098555780X|4.0|Explains the most basic terms in cord, knots and hitching. Many fun projects for young and old, decorative and functional. Recommend!
B003B02O0U|5.0|This was one of the first Grisham books I had the pleasure of reading and it did hold you on the edge of your seat onlike some of the newer Grisham stories.  I think this is the one book that the movie did some justice.  Even though I read this long while ago, i bought it for my kindle so I could read it again when the mood struck.
B00309GDF4|5.0|The Seller of this was very timely is shipping, within the time indicated. Very good condition, and the video was way better than I anticipated - though getting use to the actor playing Prince Charles took a while. This is kind of a good documentary with poetic license, but gives good human  insight into the dilemmas of being royalty and traditional in a changing world.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Use the site everyday.  Love using in when I am relaxing in bed and not sitting up by the computer.
B0083SBJXS|1.0|Never worked ... Not even the main menu ... I had to watch it on the DVD copy ... If your Blue Ray player is not the last model do not bother wasting your money in the Blueray, just acquirenthe DVD or go for a new player ... We bougth our Panasonic blueray player on 2011 and the disc says is too old and suggest acquiring a new one or update Firmware , with no further instructions ...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's so cool (best game ever)<br /><br />Whoever made this game tell them that it's awesome<br /><br />So now I love this game !!!!!!
B002WD4MLG|5.0|Great writing and Elmore Leonard's delicious irony dominate this splendid comedy. I would caution families to be mindful of the abundance of paint peeling profanity it abounds in. The soundtrack is great with a good deal of it coming from Booker T. and the MG's and in HD the image is vivid and crisp!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|The dark knife trilogy is by far one of the best trilogy's ever! With great action and suspense these are must watch movies!
B008MEM24S|5.0|A fun way to while away the time. Great for Disney fans. Completing every level, with every gnome and/or objective makes it a better challenge.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|The Lord of the rings is by far the greatest trilogy of all time. They are almost exactly like the book. I can't wait for the rest of the hobbit movies to come out! These movies are a must watch!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A cute little horse game. My daughter enjoys playing it a lot. Tons of fun for kids and adults a like .

0871164566|4.0|I liked the Christmas tree design except when I tried to make it, I found the dimensions and directions incorrect.  I was very disappointed when this happen.  I had to take my own common sense to straighten it out.  It took about 5 practice pieces and rewriting the directions and then I made it happen.  Haven't tried anything else in the book, nothing else appealed to me and I guess I'm direction shy now with this last experience.  A few techniques have some promise for me in the future to incorporate in something else.  So I have this review &#34;I like it&#34; because of this.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This is our favorite show. Each season is better than the one before. We own all four seasons and watch them over and over. Highly recommended.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Although Elementary season one, at least insofar as I have watched the episodes, is more of a weekly police procedural than a who done it, it is well written and very well acted.  One quickly forgets that a female Watson is unusual and that is a tribute to both the writing and the actors,  An enjoyable hour every time, which is more than most TV shows these days.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the horse options but it needs more options for tournaments maybe add Finnish and German national championships and even more!
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I heard the title song on the radio one Sunday, and ordered the CD to be able to play it a lot.  Then found the other songs well done also.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I can always count on the Big Bang to cause, &#34;laughing out loud&#34;, to occur. Absolutely love this hilarious series!
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Enjoy the beats of the music, although the word are a little strange. I may be to old to understand the meaning behind the words, but I like the music it lifts my spirit.
0525457585|5.0|I like the colors on this book text.  Some use varying font face but the purple/green really adds to the story/concept.  Most of the text maintained a consistent darkness which was something I was concerned about.  If you want a review of the story itself, you're going to have to read someone else's review.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|My daughter LOVES these reusable sticker pads! She is almost three-and-a-half and she does have a difficult time peeling off the smaller stickers (like crowns and shoes) but she is getting better at that. It's awesome for fine motor skills and for imagination! We purchased this pack and the animals/scenery pack and I can't tell which one she loves more. She uses them to tell stories. The only way the dress up one could be better is if it came with her-size clothes so she could match the characters!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|This is a great game and easily expandable. It comes with a good scoring board (better than the original Dixit).  It has enough room to store multiple sets of cards too!<br />I'd recommend getting sleeves for your cards on this one.  There are some Mayday sleeves that work well but they are the cheap thickness ones.  I found some from Swanpanasia but they aren't here yet.  Nice thing about the Swan cards is that they are packaged with 90 sleeves so you don't have a lot of extras when you're playing Dixit :)<br />[..]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I don't really love horses I just love the game. this game is very efficient. I love it. gets five stars from me.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Yes, it's a little pricee.....but so worth it if you love Lego! Go for it before it's gone like other sets that I wished were in my collection.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is a white noise soundboard so you can customize for whatever mood/preference you have (up to ten noises simultaneously). There are a few mixes under &#34;favorites&#34; or you can add your own. Most importantly, there's a timer (with the option of closing the app at the end) which is great if you're using this to fall asleep to or time a study or yoga session. I'm impressed with the free version, and have tried other white noise apps that just seem inferior compared to this one. The difference between this and the paid app, as near as I can tell, is that you get more noises and no ads on that paid version (though there are quite a lot of noises on the free version and the ads aren't intrusive).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just honestly thought that this book was wonderful. I never once stopped reading, I never once expected what was to come, and I never once stopped gasping and being surprised. Thank you so much for giving me this read.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This strategy game reminded me of a clever take on a single person game of risk, only instead of war and domination, it's the plague. Love the concept.<br /><br />As for the game play? There's another reviewer who mentioned buying it and spending the next five hours playing it. I did the exact same thing, and would have continued if I didn't need to charge my kindle.<br /><br />The game itself is really thorough, and I'm impressed with the variation and detail that went into this considering that it's a $.99 app. There's multiple difficulties, and the more you play and succeed, the more you can unlock different settings (or pay to unlock, I guess). Each of the different plague types reacts differently, and you must plan your strategy to devastate the world accordingly. It is a really accurate disease simulator many ways. I showed it to my mom who works on the laboratory side of the medical field and after playing with it for several hours, she gave the it the same review that I did.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The ultimate romance movie. If you love period material, this one is superbly done. It captures the social culture of a time which has passed on. The scene in the rain between the two main characters is classic. Not to be out done. They need to make more movies like this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is excellent. We have numerous tablets fones etc and it is downloaded on all so I've always got one at hand just for this game.I love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Easyish game that you can play any time you have a few minutes to kill. Would reccomend this game to anyone.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed is the second book of Colleen Hoover that I have read. While Hopeless was more involved this one,  This- her first published book, will suck you in and keep your interest. I got the book late yesterday and by today with a lot of life's  interuptions have completed it because it begged reading. These  young people have a lot to deal with and are learning life is not fair but it is life none the less.<br />Lake's brother acts just like I would expect a 9 yr old who has gone thru the death of a parent to act. Some times his age, some times not and some times older.<br />Lake has to learn to deal with a lot of emotion and anger and shifts in her life while Will has to deal with many of the same issues plus being a substitute parent at age 19.<br />I am not  young, in fact I am 71. I will tell you I got the book as a surprise gift from the author after I had read Hopeless - a book I will read again. Colleen Hoover understands her subject matter and has done her research well.<br />Take the time to read it ... I am now starting her other book, Point of Retreat. Once it is done, I will no longer have a new book of hers to read so will await her next book.
B0014JGDUC|3.0|These are great shoes, but you HAVE to buy them wider than your usual size.  I bought 8M and they were very narrow and put an uncomfortable, painful pressure on the top part of my foot.  I have other non bistro crocs where this has not happened.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I think that it is the best I ever played I wish that the more games like this
0007466064|5.0|Part 1 of book five continues the George RR Martin &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; series after the somewhat disorienting book 4.  In part one of book 5, some of the main characters start to re-enter the story and there are a few jaw dropping revelations.  Couldn't wait to order book 5, part 2, though I greatly fear what will happen when I finally run out of story when I finish it!  George Martin needs to step up the work and finish the last two books so we can finish our investment in his tale before we forget the characters and scenarios that have unfolded over the first 5 1/2 books.  I purchased the books because I simply couldn't wait to see the story play out over 8 years on HBO - I just had to know.  I still have to know!  Common Mr. Martin - when is book 6 coming???
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is awesome ! don't miss it you'll never get bored with it and trying to get all the dragons is fun.
B004CGUC06|5.0|THE EMOTION HID UNDER THE APARTED STORY STRUCTURE, AND IT SEEMED SO EASY FOR A MASTER LIKE FELLINI. DON'T BE FOOLED BY ITS RANDOM STORY-TELLING WAY. I BELIEVE CAN FEEL HOW ITALIANS TREAT LIFE, LOVE AND BIG CHANGES AROUND US.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|try it...and the many options. right now I have heavy rain<br />tent rain kept me up with memories but all in all I am amazed at how an insomniac can suddenly find rest.  good night
B0000640SA|5.0|GREAT DVD OF NOLAN'S FIRST MASTERPIECE! BUT...WE MAY EVEN GET CONFUSED BY THE WHOLE STORY, SO...PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME CONFUSED BY THE MENU, OKAY?!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I'm totally hooked on this mini-series!  The DVD set was such a bargain with 15 hours of segments to enjoy.
B001DZ9GRE|5.0|THE BEST COLLECTION FOR A FAMALE ARTIST SO FAR. IF YOU LOVE ANNIE LENNOX, LOVE THIS COLLECTION. NO MORE FUSSY WORDS TO SAY. BUY IT WITH CONFIDENCE.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|We are very pleased with this purchase. It is nice to have the re-mastered versions of the Pink. Now I just have to keep my daughters from &#34;borrowing&#34; them...
B001EOQWFI|5.0|THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR, BUT SURELY NOT THE BEST BLU-RAY OF THE YEAR, THE WHOLE QUALITY OF THE VIDEO BECAME A LITTLE OVER-EXPOSED, BUT THE VIDEO BEHIND THE SCENES BECAME OF MUCH FUN, I THINK.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I've been following actress/singer Emmy Rossum's career for quite a while, and I think that one of the truest things that anyone can say about her is that she never does what one might expect. For example, in 2004 she earned many positive reviews and several awards for her performance in the film version of [[ASIN:B002QRWJA4 Phantom of the Opera]]. After that many fans expected an album for classical crossover music and showtunes. Instead, Rossum took a year off from filmmaking in order to cowrite and record 2007's [[ASIN:B000W7Y1LK Inside Out]]. The album mixed adult contemporary pop with new age. While it earned some accolades, the primary criticsm of it was that while Rossum has a beautiful voice, the layered vocals on the album obscured it somewhat. Rossum then left music for a while to make several films and star on the hit Showtime series [[ASIN:B0041KKZKA Shameless: The Complete First Season]] (currently in it's 3rd season). But in 2013 she released a follow up album of a very different style.<br /><br />\\"Sentimental Journey\\" is a collection of covers of popular music of the 1920's-1960's. The songs are arranged as a musical calendar, with each one evoking, either lyrically or emotionally, the feeling of a different month. Hence songs like \\"I'm Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover\\" for March (St. Patrick's Day), \\"These Foolish Things\\" for April (April Fool's Day), and \\"Apple Blossom Time\\" for May. According to Rossum, this was the music she grew up with. It was what her mother played around the house when she was a child, and sang to her as lullabies. Her emotional connection to the material definitely comes through here. The best thing I can possibly say about this album is that Rossum makes these songs, written many years ago and covered by many artists since, sound fresh. The notion of the album as a musical calendar doesn't feel gimmicky (it could have!) and Rossum connects beautifully with the emotional content of the different songs: she'll make you smile on\\"The Object of My Affection\\" (which features a spoken bit from Rossum's \\"Shameless\\" costar, William H. Macy), and weep on \\"Autumn Leaves (Les Feulles Mortes)\\".<br /><br />One adjective that a lot of people use to describe this album has been \\"jazzy\\". Interestingly it's the less \\"jazzy\\" tracks that I like the best: \\"The Object of My Affection\\", \\"I'm Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover\\", \\"Apple Blossom Time\\", \\"Summer Wind\\", \\"Autumn Leaves\\", and \\"Pretty Paper\\" are among my favorites. Not that the jazzier songs are bad! Rossum sounds sultry and rich on songs like \\"These Foolish Things\\", \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\", and the title song. She also gets in touch with her country side on the song \\"Many Tears Ago\\" (Rossum sang bluegrass tunes in the 2000 film [[ASIN:B00005O0SO Songcatcher]]). Interestingly, \\"Pretty Paper\\", which was written as a country song, is taken in a different direction on here. Unlike many actresses who consider themselves singers, Rossum has a beautiful voice. She also has a strong musical background and a gift several different styles.<br /><br />Will this album ensure that classics of the past are on the top 40 once again? Probably not. But it provides us with a lovely interpretation of some of these standards and  hopefully it will at least introduce some of Rossum's younger fans to the popular music of a different era. It's hard to say where Rossum's music career will go from here, but one thing I can predict is that she's unlikely to do what's expected!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|DON'T BUY IT FOR CHILDREN, IT'LL BE A WASTE. THIS IS A CINEMA PIECE ESPECIALLY FOR GROWN-UPS TO LOOK FOR MORE.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We love this movie.  Every husband and/or father should watch it.  There are some definite Christian values shared.  They don't even try to hide them.<br /><br />Whether you share the Christian faith or not, our country should stand up and embrace the values shared in this movie.  It is a must see.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|JUST LOVE IT, AS A CHINESE AUDIENCE WE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WENT WILD AT THAT TIME, BUT WE'RE SURE IT'S A GOOD FILM, AND IT'S ...REALLY HOT!!! JIM CURRY IS TIMELESS! AND OF COURSE WITH SUSAN...ONE OF MY MOST BELOVED ACTRESSES.
0446580848|3.0|Probably DeMille's weakest novel. More time is spent on Corey's attitude than the plot line. I have read everyone of his novel's, so I feel I can judge this effort. I think it is time to put Corey to bed.
B002XUL6QW|3.0|THE WHOLE STORY WAS REALLY HOLLOW, BUT THE DESIGN AND THE HANDLE OF THE WHOLE ELEMENT WAS TRULY UNFORGETTABLE AND AT HIGH-LEVEL. WATCH IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TOP FILMS TO.
B005QUQP76|3.0|Good all around mouse. The cabling is nice and the sheathing to it is a benefit.<br />The buttons are good except I dislike the thumb button to lower the DPI. It's too far forward. my hands may be big or I hold the mouse differently.<br /><br />Unfortunately mine lasted 4 months and refused to power on. RMA'ing with Corsair. I've always been a logitech consumer and thought I'd try this brand. Guess we'll see how they handle a RMA.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME I TRULY FEEL THE FORTH BE WITH ME SINCE I FIRST WATCHED IT ON TV. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I remember watching Upstairs Downstairs with my mom when I was a little girl.  Now my little girl watches DA with me.  I spent three weeks catching up and enjoyed every moment. Now that I have to wait each week for the new episode I find myself watching  old episodes.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|BECAUSE PIXAR LOOKED EVERY FOLLOWING &#34;TOY STORY&#34; AS THEIR LAST ONE, SO IT WENT BETTER AND BETTER. BUT DREAMWORKS THOUGHT PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS WATCH &#34;SHREK&#34; NO MATTER HOW IT SUCKS, SO... IT WENT SUCKER.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie:-) We both thought it was action packed and well put together. It was what we hoped it was.
B000VECAC6|5.0|PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU WON'T SAY IT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO YOURSELF...WHEN YOU DIE. INTERESTING FILM WITH A BETTER FORMAT AND QUALITY.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not like the Hollywood story, this is real life hero's not phony Hollywood those almost hero's.  Buy and read truth !!!
B005ARYDYC|4.0|THE PASSION KEEPS IT A GREAT WORK, WITHOUT WHICH IT WON'T BE THAT GREAT.<br />PLAIN, AND SOMETIMES EVEN A LITTLE POINTLESS, HOWEVER, THE BLU-RAY FEATURES KEEP IT AT AN &#34;A&#34; STANDARD.
B009RROP12|4.0|Never Too Late sounds like a blend of Survivor & solo material from Steve Perry. I don't know how that sounds to anyone else, but I works well for me.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|THE DARK SCENS BECAME BRIGHTER THAN EVER DVD EDITIONS, SO I'M SURE I CAN MORE DETAILS IN IT, WITH THE STARS' GREAT PERFORMACES.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I've been hooked on AHS since the first season. For some reason my DVR didn't record an episode of the second season so when I found I could purchase it to watch on Amazon I was thrilled!! Now I didn't have to miss an episode.
B0017OB12O|5.0|BETTER THAN THE LIMITED DVD EDITION. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF MORE SPECIAL FEATURES, BUT ALSO FOR THE FAR BETER PICTURE QUALITY OF THE MAIN FEATURE FILM. RECOMMENDEDED STRONGLY.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a good read. Once you start reading you don't want to stop. I would recommend it to anyone interested in reading to read it. I bet you'll enjoy it!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I ONCE MET A LIMITED DVD BOXSET WITH NEO'S SCULPTURE, HOWEVER, WHEN BLU-RAY CAME OUT, IT SOON BECAME MY FINAL CHOICE. HIGH-TECH WORK SHOULD BE HANDLED BY HIGHER TECH FORMAT, DON'T U THINK SO?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So far, and almost to the ending, it's very enjoyable.......I would certainly recommend it for easy reading.  Emotional and touching and makes you remember things from your own past.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|OSCAR IS GONNA REGRET FOR NOT GIVING THE BEST PICTURE TO &#34;SOCIAL NETWORK&#34;, A FILM FILLED WITH MODERN FEELINGS, BESIDE REALISM AND HUMANITY.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I loved every bit of this trilogy.<br />The 1st 2 books grabbed me more than the 3rd - and the ending was a little strange...but you've heard all the talk - it really does live up to expectations (well in my world anyway!).
B009KKLQKO|2.0|I attended the Beach Boys 50th Anniversary show in New Orleans on April 27 & in Tampa on May 8.  Both shows were excellent.  It's too bad this dvd could not more closely replicate what I saw in person.  I understand the need to be selective in which songs were to be on this dvd.  However, it is beyond my comprehension that any live Beach Boys dvd could be released that fails to include Barbara Ann and Surfing U.S.A.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Read it in just over a day - didn't want to put it down!<br />An unexpected romance that pulls at your heart - and shocks you with its twists.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is terrific. I love the characters and the places that it keeps moving too. The world tour started perfectly in New York and now it is in Rio. Get this game. You won't regret it.
B00AATV046|5.0|This movie is one that everyone should spend a couple of hours on.  I can't say enough good about it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Just got the game a few days ago, and I'm already addicted to it! Definitely a game for when you want to kill time. I recommend this! :)
B009SQRL4U|5.0|A nice family movie or the whole family. A Christmas classic. I could not stop laughing it about it. I do not know why I have to write an essay for a review
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Do not watch the trailer as it has a spoiler in it.  Interesting story, good music, and views of South Africa like I had never seen - gorgeous.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My granddaughters (3 and 5 years old) love this game! There's no score keeping. . .just lots of interactive  fun taking care of patients. . . dogs, an elephant, a cat or two, a sheep. . .8 different animals.  They come into the waiting room and then are taken to their hospital bed, which can be changed to a princess bed or a flowered bed or a race car. They pick up the trash in the rooms with quite interesting sound effects. They can play the radio to cheer up the patients. They can start the ceiling fan if they are hot. The animals have different ailments . . .dry eyes, chicken pox, stomach viruses, etc. They get their blood pressure checked, heart checked. . .they get eye drops, medicated cream, etc. Lots of fun! I highly recommend it for pre-schoolers.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I play it with my friends a lot. I play it with my mom we have so much fun:). I love it.
B00884GR0W|2.0|I would love to rate this game 5 stars, but I cannot and do not play it because it still does not have 3rd person point of view. I discussed this with the developer many months ago and am still waiting. Since I never load BS and play Minecraft instead, I feel my money has been spent in vain, though I harbor high hopes because of the games great potential. 3rd person POV is a breaking point for me - obviously.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is so fun and addictive. You have to get it!!! To not get would be terrible. You can choose many different characters and they are all unique. Right now there is a world tour theme. The date is February 2nd. We're gonna be in Rio for the next 25 days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting everyone in the house loves to play this game.Totally worth downloading, you will not regret it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was entertaining and I loved the story line. Would definitely recommend. Beautiful love story about happiness, learning to love again, and trust.
B002KFJWBG|4.0|you can feel the group were bummed that they knew their music hadnt been<br />received well enough (criminally) for future releases to be supported,<br />so this music feels like a going-away party..like any going away party,<br />its bittersweet.<br />the sweet parts, however, are heart-wrenching.<br />without using too many words, o&o is, well, an amazing recording.<br />r.i.y.l. the beatles, love, hollies, turtles, raspberries, etc.<br />5 stars.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good book, but would be appreciated more by younger readers.  I would recommend it for junior high or high school students.
B00004SA88|5.0|Mr Accardo does Him a great service in these recordings. But if only Paganini could be heard live again.... he would put all these crap \\"rock stars\\" out of business forever. Imagine if Paganini lived today, he'd put the Electric guitar out of reach of all mortals  present & in the future.....just for the fun of it playing part time to amuse himself....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Was one of the BEST books I've read in a really long time. Wasn't even something I would normally pick, was recommended to me by a good friend & fellow book-lover. It is a MUST-READ!!!
B009O07NBQ|5.0|Howard Shore is a genius!  All of his LOTR soundtracks are amazing, and this one did not disappoint.  Thanks Howard!
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|One of the best comedies out of 1960 this movie is a great spectacle. Jack Lemon's neuroticism is palpable and the story is delightfully constructed. The humor isn't in your face, but carries over from one generation to the next without missing a step. A must-watch for any classic film lover.
0007448058|5.0|I purchased A Game of Thrones for my husband.  He is enjoying reading them, so that must mean they are good.  He is not the one in the family that really sits down and reads....but he is now!<br /><br />He did say the book gives more detail about who they are and where they come from and some history of the people.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A lot of science fiction--which I love--is based so far into the future and with capabilities that defy current physics and border on magic.  This is an interesting twist that stays within the bounds of what humanity is currently capable.  It is also grounded in the reality of Mars as we know it.  I recommend it.  Also, once I find an author that writes something like this, I start mining his other works!
0345803485|1.0|I am a huge reader.  I'll read anything. I decided that emptying the kitty litter box was a task better undertaken that to continue to read this book.  As a woman I am horrified. There is not one iota of erotica in this book, just garage.  DO NOT buy this book - and if you've been stupid enough to have downloaded it, save your time - DON'T read it.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|The case is nice. I haven't had any mishaps yet to really rank it. Only thing I can say so far is that sometimes its hard to push the buttons with the front protective case on, but not a big deal. I also notice that the sound gets fuzzy when listening to music or tv but again, not a big deal knowing my phone will be safe.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Although I liked this movie, as with all streaming videos there is a risk of refresh or buffering delays while you watch.  This probably has as much to do with your level of cable speed as anything, but mine is top of the billing chart with Time-Warner and I still had issues with it.  Until streaming improves, or you can purchase streamers for less than $10, I will probably buy the discs going forward for the extra $3.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I am so glad I read this book. Of course the movie does not even come close to capturing the angst and suffering that pi when through. Great read!!
0393345084|5.0|This book also should be mandatory reading for all members of Congress, the US Treasury, the President, etc.  As a child of The Great Depression, I can share Mr. Krugman's frustration.  Those who fail to learn history repeat its mistakes!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love the whole series.  Great show that really sucks you you in and want to come back for more.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  It was very nostalgic for me,  I loved the actors in it and the story!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game! Play it all the time. Love how the scenery changes every so often. Graphics are colorful! Need to get awards quicker.
B0019K06WM|5.0|Recently, I have begun rebuilding my music library.  This in one album that I never had.  I love this album, yet, I am<br />very biased... I LOVE ALL CROSBY, STILLS, NASH... AND EVEN MOST NEIL YOUNG.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love it. there are many more obisticles than in temple run 1 and i think that this game is the best one in the app store right now and i cant wait until they make a temple run 3. that is if the make a temple run 3

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Don't be put off by the large number of pages!  Nearly half are notes at the end.  This was a well-written true story of Lincoln's life and interactions with his cabinet and congress during his last 5 years.  I found it fascinating/`
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was awesome  This type of game is great.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  It's not just a hum drum hidden objects game. Extremely fun!!!<br />Please more games like this would be great.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Thanks for the quick turn and delivery.  We have been savoring each episode to stretch it out while waiting for the second season to become available on DVD.
B003Y7PML8|5.0|This is a must own.<br /><br />As soon as this arrived I tore open the album (which was wonderfully wrapped) and put it on the record player. It is a 186 gram record so it has great weight to it and a wonderful warmth that digital just doesn't have. We had friend over for dinner and I put this bad boy on and everyone loved it.<br /><br />This is a can't miss if you're a fan of old blue eyes.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|A must see for everyone. The movie takes many twists and turns; all of which are quite relevant.<br />Watch this movie and understand that characteristics of any of the roles, can pertain to any one ... male or female.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun and easy game to play. The only  negative is that there are so many pop ups that interupt your game.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really great game and I would recommend it for anyone who likes horses and if u r thinking about getting a horse then you should definitely get this game hope u like l it
B00969PR18|2.0|it could be more useful if it worked offline and who needs this app it works online not offline and index abetter to use
B00992CF6W|5.0|I tried but I just don't know how to<br />I'm still working on it but I still havent figured it out yet
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I must now make my anguished confession: I was one of those who let \\"Firefly\\" die. Not that my watching it when it was first broadcast 11 years ago would have saved it, but I certainly would have been one of the thousands of fans who wrote to the Fox Network and helped pay for trade industry ads in an attempt to save the show. Only just now have I watched the complete series--all 12 episodes of it--and I think it is one of the best shows in the history of television. It is witty, poignant, exciting, with a spaceship full of rich, fully realized characters played by a sterling cast. All the actors were so wonderful, in fact, that my favorite tended to be the one I was watching at the time.<br /><br />I like science fiction and love Westerns, and Joss Whedon's synthesis of the two genres went far beyond clever. In a mere handful of episodes, Whedon and his collaborators created a totally convincing fictional world, with consistent rules and very believable dangers. The \\"Making Of\\" documentary in this DVD set demonstrates amply the attachment the actors and crew had to the show, and to each other, as well as the disappointment bordering on abject grief they felt at the show's cancellation.<br /><br />I'm happy that most of \\"Firefly's\\" actors have gone on to success. But I'd much rather see Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds than as Richard Castle, and while I wouldn't give up Christina Hendricks as Joan Harris for anything, I will miss her as Saffron, the baddest bad girl in the galaxy. In any case, \\"Firefly\\" is a textbook example of a program that should have premiered on premium cable, where it would have had a chance for an audience to acclimate itself to the world of Mal Reynolds and his crew. At least I have the feature film \\"Serenity\\" to look forward to, and I can buy this DVD set, which I plan to do. But meanwhile, if Jayne Cobb decides to come after me, Vera in hand, all I will be able to say in response is, \\"Mea culpa.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game. Ive been playing non stop for about two weeks. It keeps me highly entertained. Keep making games like this
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was one of those impossible to put down books.  Good insights into the trama of this type of situation.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Absolutely amazing! I watched each episode twice. It really helped me to follow all the characters by looking them up on line. Be careful though because wikipedia has spoilers in their character profiles.<br /><br />I'm freaking out! Counting the days until they release season two. I was gonna try to wait and get the season on Netflix or the library for free but I just can't wait. I'm gonna have to buy it.
B007Y36K46|5.0|It seems the only press this movie got was disappointing movie sells.  Well, that is a loss for scifi/fantasy fans (and mine, because there will not be a sequel).  Just because it didn't meet expectations at the box office doesn't mean its not a good.  Being a scifi fan, and a ERB fan, I thought the movie was a really good.  Story was good, most characters were good, special effects were good.  Yes, it was good.  It was also a movie you can go back to.  I will of course need to reread all my John Carter books, its been a while.  If I was to be critical of one thing, it was the princess.  She was just to much of a selfish-B the whole time.  It was all me, me, me.  Yes, I guess princesses can be like that, but it was just a bit much.  Plus, I never believed her when she wasn't.  Other than her, awesome movie.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Just heard about this app for my Kindle so haven't really had much chance to use it.<br />I'm British so I thought it would be nice to have....gotta be good, eh?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very fun game to play it is exciting 2 it has cool boards and fun character's to be.
B008OHV4PG|3.0|I bought this because I used to live in Omemee.<br />The tour of the area was kind of neat but I didn't think much of the songs.
0802473156|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone.  I gives insight and understanding on why people are the way they are.  Once we can understand someone's love language we can adjust to make them feel loved.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is an excellent fantasy story in the novella format.  Sanderson really put this together well with the right amount of intrigue, characterization, & fantasy concepts.  One concern that one would have with a short fantasy book is that there would be too many &#34;fantasy&#34; ideals that are hard to explain in such a short time. Basically, there could be a worry that the reader does not know what's really going on -- not so with this book, the author does it perfectly.  I have only read one other work by him, &#34;The Way of Kings&#34; (it was amazing & I highly recommend it) -- I think this guy is a great writer & really knows how to tell a story.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  I watch it every year during the Christmas season.  It helps put things in perspective of how for good or bad our lives touch the lives of others.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you have not seen this show on BBC, please start with Season 1 and work your way through.  It's a wonderful classic from BBC with superior production, acting, writing and authenticity.  If you've ever enjoyed a period piece, you'll love this series.  For return viewers, it's fantastic to be able to watch all of Season 3 when you want to.  I had a Dowton Abbey marathon and watched first show to last.  I most highly recommend this masterpiece!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A wonderful story that I want to believe is true.  The story is written in first person throughout the book. The insights and interesting information regarding the ownership of an Indian Zoo is so fascinating. The diary like description of being lost at sea in a lifeboat through the eyes of a sixteen year old boy contains humor, discovery, and survival. A good read for those who wish to be caught up in the events at sea.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love this app on the kindle fire it works well I love that u can see everything on the screen.Love twitter
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever played l o l o l o l o l o l o l o l o l
B004NELBPC|5.0|love this news app I like that u can get all of your news in 1 place.There are so many different catagories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!<br />I liked it because it was so detailed and awesome.<br />I would recommend thus book to my friends that have not read it yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway sitters at firtlst I thought it would be one of those cheesey games that my brother loves!!! So then I tried it and it wasn't cheesey. Its basically temple run in a safe way
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is amazing! You never get bored of it.I wish that the boards were less expensive. Otherwise it is a great application.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought temple run 2 was a lot better then temple run 1  and because i think the ropes and carts were a great addition
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I've seen PewDiePie play this, so I thought I knew what to do, but Oh My God, I was wrong. Buy this app, it's the best of its kind.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent new season allows not only for terrific story lines but also excellent character development. This is especially so for Thomas, O'brien, Lady Edith, and Daisy. If you liked seasons one and two, you will love season three!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the best game ever. I will always play it. I hope a lot of people play it. thankyou for making it.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|It gets 2 stars because I was drawn along but no way did I believe the main characters were teenagers. If they'd been early 30's the maturity level would be more believable. Really don't get the hype on this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game, has the same intensity as the original temple run but with different challenges. I would reccomend this game to everyone.
0062082353|4.0|I'm sure everyone has heard by now that Chris Kyle died. Shot by a coward. I hope justice is brought against who shot him. RIP my friend....
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Star Wars merged with Angry Birds... What could be better than that. The graphics are awesome, the sound quality is cool, the abilities of the different birds mirror the abilities of the film fairly well. PLUS you have an angry bird with a light saber.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was even better than I thought it would be. Instantly in reading this I drew a parallel between it and the overly dramatic  New Moon by Stephanie Meyer. I began thinking I would hate it because of the instant change of Lena and her desire to push Ethan away as Edward did to Bella. But as they say, don't judge a book by its cover, you must not judge a story by its beginning. The writers kept you thinking you, because what you thought was going to happen was flipped  to something you couldn't even dream of happening. Amazing.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|really good<br />i like it alot it is always fun to play with my friends like it too!! it is fun
B003U2QHB6|3.0|Saw &#34;Bogus Journey&#34; for the first time over the weekend and it literally blew my and a handful of online friends' heads.  Clever, funny, well-acted and fully aware of its premise and sense of humor.  The rare sequel that improves and is way better than its predecessor? Yes way!  Shame the transfer on amazon is just a quick-and-dirty SD port of the DVD content, which frankly looks like ass on the computer or an HDTV with a smart app (which is how I saw it).  The movie is the star so don't let the technical shortcomings keep you from seeing it, jet set your expectations accordingly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it ithink its better than temple run and that is sayi something cus fat game is awesome<br />I wonder what is after rio?
B0013N7AD8|5.0|I am comics fans and a huge fan of Batman. I own the DVD versions of these films so of coarse I had to upgrade to the blu-ray version. Since I own these films on the other formats I could instantly tell the difference in audio and picture quality as soon as I put them in. The picture and audio quality gets better with each film. If you are a fan of Batman and these film you will not be disappointed.
B008133MDK|5.0|So I've noticed a pattern with the two seasons of Sherlock. It follows the Indiana Jones curse. The odd episodes are always good, while the even ones are drawn out fill and less entertaining. Episode 1 of this season is my favorite. The banter and play with Irine Adler is awesome.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|This is great, Phillip has such a wonderful voice. Couldn't be happier. Arrive new & on time. I can't wait to hear from him/
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book at the beginning because I loved the TV series Dexter and I was looking forward to the detail of the book...that being said, about halfway through the book the two stories began to differ then came to an abrupt halt like the author was at a loss for the end of the story and just stopped writing. I will read the rest of the series because I love the story-line and am curious as to how it will progress...
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Great read, pages fly by. Never found myself looking to finish a chapter just so I could stop. Hemingway really makes you love spoke characters and hate some.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love this game.  It didn't take too long to play and I didn't get bored. The hints kept things moving when I got stuck so I didn't get frustrated either. I'd get other's like it. At $2.99 the price is good too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is freaking awesome but it's a little too easy  I got to the end in 5 minutes but other than that it's pretty cool
1781163243|4.0|The art work of a worthy successor the Halo franchise, you can see the beginning still of another great three games!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is magnificent!! I love it!!! Get it please!! It's the best game on my iPad!!!! It'll keep you busy and you will NOT get bored!!!
159562015X|5.0|Used this book for a leadership course.  The online access to the personality evaluation is key to the book and working to understand your personal skills and strengths.  From the test, you can use the book to see some very useful breakdowns and descriptions of yourself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I've been playing it for a few months now and I play it every day I wish they came out with a subway surfers 2 and more characters though
B001K3ENEA|3.0|I bought these to use in a traveling recording setup because I don't like to take my best gear on the road, and because I have a lot of respect for AKG microphones, especially the 414. They are quite comfortable, and the cable is stout and can stand up to vigorous use, which is why I gave them 3 stars.<br /><br />But these headphones come up quite short in clarity and are way too heavy in the bass and low midrange to be useful as a reference. In my home studio, I use Sony MDR7506 because the clarity and accuracy is unmatched in my opinion.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359900725&sr=8-1&keywords=sony+mdr+7506+headphones<br /><br />With only about $30 difference in price between the two, the Sonys are kind of a no-brainer for me. If you really want strong bass and don't care as much about clarity in the highs, the AKGs might suit you; but if you need clean, balanced, accurate reproduction the Sonys are the way to go.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire was very good,even though this is the third time I've read it. I am very obsessed with the trilogy and LOVE everything about it... it's passion, and its meaning to keep you on the edge of your seat every minute. I feel each time I re-read the Hunger Games trilogy I'm reading it for the very first time(again).
B00170I7GG|4.0|Great movie and good quality. Watched on February 1 st so maybe there were just too many people with the same idea but loading was a problem throughout the movie.... Stopped 3-4 times for 30 seconds. This is likely cable issue not amazon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the coolest game I have played. The chasing is fun because you have to escape the officer and his dog.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Yet another great Michael Connelly novel, I can't wait for the next one!!  As always, I couldn't put this one down. I love the Harry Bosch series!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|This game keeps you on your toes looking for the various things you need, I like the graphics as well.
B0053O89IS|5.0|this product made my wife's day she love this show plus product came wrapped and no scratches  cant wait to buy the next season
B0062NAX1U|5.0|So, I'll be the first to admit that the story is a bit heavy on religion (which is okay with me given that I was born and raised as a Christian who later decided to attend a Christian college), but I admire the overall themes of the movie and all that it aspires to be.  Lots to like in this one related to love, loss, redemption, retribution, etc.  Everyone can find something to like in this movie...
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I chose this rating because overall I liked the book but it was a little confusing in some parts. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|We enjoyed this film very much and have recommended it to all of our friends. Will watch it again. Acting and story line are great.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Night circus is a magical tale that gives up its secrets only very slowly over time.  Well worth the time spent.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Very well done. Realistic portrayal of struggles of polio victim trying to have something that resembles a normal sex life.  Helen Hunt was outstanding as the sympathetic sex therapist.  Starts out very professional but along the way something changes.  You need to see it rather than have me tell you.  Hawkers is also excellent.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have wanted to read this book for a long time and when I saw that they were making a movie on it I had to get it.  It downloaded straight from my computer to my kindle.
B000I186FW|3.0|Overall, a good entertaining movie.  I got a bit tired of the recurring larger-than-life bad guy on the big screen however.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I've seen this movie and it was amazing.  I bought the book to see if the movie measured up to the book, I have not read the whole thing yet, but so far its very good.  I also loved that I bought it and it automatically downloaded to my Kindle.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game is interesting and keeps you thinking.  Every new board is progressively more difficult.  It is good for young and old alike.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is great on the Kindle Fire! The interface is fairly intuitive. The hint timer is a big help.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. My friend told me that I had to watch it and I'm so glad I did. I laughed so hard! Everyone I've shown it to has laughed equally as hard and has loved it. You should give it a chance you won't regret it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it and it's a lot of fun when you have time to kill. Would recommend it to all of my friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is great! I love how fun and interactive it is! This is a really popular product that is a must have. Great game
B009K0P10K|4.0|All the players are back - in another season - all scheming - but with real heart..Can't wait to continue & watch other episodes..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game a lot. It is very good time passer. Sometimes when I have a long break at work, I just pick up the kindle and play it a little. It never really gets boring.
B008DM4OTA|2.0|This app is cute and fun to play for a few min, however it is just too repetitive for me. As far as I could tell its only waiting on patients and cleaning up their trash. No time limit or scoring or difficulty. Not worth the 3bucks I paid for it.  Guess I was expecting something like the food stand/restaurant games. /Shrug Ohh well<br /><br />Its good for little kids, absolutely
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is Awsome!!!!! You can hit trashcans and like jump over stuff like trains i love it. It is the best game i eva played love it
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Some things take awhile to load and print but for the most part it is very easy to operate. Would recommend.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Only had it about a week, but so far, so good.  Had lots of trouble with the previous app failing to retrieve mail all the time.  This one seems to be working so far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's addictive! I couldn't stop until I was number 1 on the leaderboard. If I had to recommend a simple yet fun game it would be this one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game and App, especially for my kids, they love it!  I would give it 5 stars, except for the fact you can't find any information about how to get updates for the apps when new versions come out... it puts Amazon in a lower &#34;quality&#34; status compared to Apps providers like &#34;iTunes&#34; for example. A new version of the game has been out for days and still can't find any information on how or when the new version will be available for the Kindle Fire for example. :(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The kind of book that fulfills any ones fantasy. Can not wait to start reading book two. Thrilling and satisfying
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its fun cool I have used it every since I installed it u should get it tell your friends u can use it on facebook and twitter
B003R0LBVW|1.0|This is so poorly written it boggles the mind how it made it onto anyone's recommendation. I didn't relate to or like any of the shallow characters. The author has the mind set of a 14 year old and none of his characters are any more mature than that.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|I downloaded this game for 4 year old daughter. I think it's pretty cool, and I like it very much. My daughter has yet to play it since I've been playing it. Thanks for creating it. It's a lot cleaner than the actual spin art.
0765325950|5.0|It is done.  The final book written, the third age over, the last battle won...I think?<br />I've been trying to figure out how to sum up in just a few words what this world according to Jordan has meant to me and truth be told, I can't.  For many this journey began 23 years ago.  For me, it began in the spring of 2001.  This was the first of many things for me.  The first series that I had ever started and the first science fiction/ fantasy book that I had ever read.  I ran into a friend of mine in a book store and I told him that I wanted to get into this genre and had tried to read the Hobbit and was overwhelmed by the content.  He told me to try the Wheel of time instead, because Robert Jordan was the modern day Tolkien.  So I tracked down the first book, The Eye of the World.  The copy that I found was a simple introductory copy with no pictures or descriptions, so I went into this completely oblivious to what I was getting myself into.  I sat down, opened the book, and got sucked into the Dragonmount.<br /><br />The already large size of the series (that was nowhere near being completed) overwhelmed me, only to discover after The Knife Dream came out that Jordan was ill and may not finish the series. I found this news to be rather daunting.  At that point, I was still reading the books that were already out, but to hear that the series may not be completed left me contemplating whether or not to continue. So I put the series to rest.  Then came the news shortly after Jordan's passing, that another author would be finishing the  story.  I picked the books back up and journeyed on.  I knew very little about Sanderson or his writing style and questioned if the quality would be as good.  Needless to say, Sanderson did not disappoint.  And here we are, the long awaited, A Memory of Light...<br /><br />It would have been nice to see the original eight that left the Two Rivers share the same space again, but that's not just how it goes.  I was satisfied with those that stood together in the final scenes.  I was also happy that what happened in the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows was not present here.  At no time did the plot feel rushed and I never felt I was being pushed to the end just to have it over. Though reuniting the major characters was desired, let's face it, this was a war not a family reunion.<br /><br />Normally, battle scenes in books confuse me.  But well done Sanderson!  I got it! This book was a tactician's dream, filled with military strategy.  Four battles took place from four different territories in preparation of the Last Battle.  It took the phrase 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' to an entirely different level.  All known beings of this world (as well as some long forgotten) came to fight- I never said what side they fought on.  And death and dying and preservation was a lesson well learned by all.  I had accepted long ago while reading this series that the death toll would be costly.  That being said, I can honestly say that two of those deaths I did not anticipate, and left me stunned and traumatized, and needing a moment to mourn.<br /><br />However, it made me remember what it was about this world that I loved and love so much.  The balance of light and dark, good and evil was represented by the truck loads.  It's a masterwork of mythological lore and duality, of trust and truth of all that is and ever should be.  After all, the end is never the end for there are neither beginnings nor endings, for the wheel forever turns.  The dead shall be reborn again in the pattern of the wheel until it is done turning, and though the time for us has come to an end, the wheel continues to turn.<br /><br />I think the best lesson learned for this book was that in order to live the best life you can, you must first embrace death.  The most powerful scene for me was when Rand learned the final and most important lesson from the man he knew as Father, Tam.  It was that it's ok to 'let go', of theguilt of not being all to everyone, and even though being the 'chosen one' meant saving the world, it did not mean that he had to carry the burdened weight of the world upon his shoulders.  Rand also learned from another that had fallen that though he was the chosen, others could be heroes too.<br /><br />Most of the mysteries were answered in this final installment and the prophecies fulfilled.  Yes, there are things that we will never know, but that's ok, we can just use our imagination to fill in the blanks.  Many of those were not important to the conclusion of this storyline.  I hold on to the thought that the Fourth Age soon begins and all will be reborn into pattern again.<br /><br />All in all, I found the conclusion gratifying and will be recommending it to years to come as well as rereading it myself.  I, both, listened to the audio read by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading ( nearing 42hours- I would recommend this with the whole series for the dramatization is wonderful )while traveling and read the book (909 pages) when at home.  I found the final book to be wonderful, filled with owe.  This installment was an emotional rollercoaster of events. This story was full of suspense and mystery and intrigue as well as the few moments of laughter (thanks Matt). It was fantastical!  The amounts of betrayal and deception were mass and took place in the most intrusive ways.  Loved it! Hated it!<br /><br />I thank Brandon Sanderson for taking on such a task.<br /><br />Robert Jordan, may you forever rest in peace knowing that your work was concluded greatly.  You are not Chaucer and The Wheel of Time was not Cantebury Tales.  Thank you.
8866130923|3.0|I would first like to say that I LOVE the design of this planner. It has the dates with some extra space on the left with a blank page on the right side. It works perfectly for me since I just write the name of the projects on the left side and the details and notes on the right.<br /><br />What I don't like about this planner is that the paper quality is COMPLETELY awful. I use a Lamy Safari fountain pen XF nib and it still bleeds through like crazy. Even some of my ballpoints go through.<br /><br />As much as I love the bright red look and the design of this planner, the paper quality is a huge deal breaker and I will be looking for a new one next year.<br /><br />Edit: Spelling and such.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My favorite game to play on the kindle!super addicting, me and my friends are always trying to beat each other's scores! DEFINITELY GET NOW!!!

B003M5AXN4|5.0|its a shame that it didn't do better seeing as how this movie repersents the speed racer anime so well.  i bit of a warning this movie is flashy so flashy you might think its a bad thing but it gose so well with the wrold of speed race and the song just gave nastolgy goosbumps.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family. Done in the 80's, before the onslaught of the political correctness agenda, the characters actually work well in this movie. Andy MacDowell is perfect in her role, as is Bill Murray. This movie is well done with a great plot, etc...
B004EC5IUW|5.0|if your an neon genesis Evangelion fan and you saw 1.1 and thoght that this movies where just a HD retelling of the anime show... This will will blow you away the story is so well told dispite how fast the action comes at you.  if you especting shinji to be the crybaby his well know to be preper to see a whole new shinji.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|This movie does not herald virtue. It promotes vice. In one moment, it says that pride is the problem that causes all the turmoil in her family. Then, it says that \\"I must choose MY own fate\\", thus promoting pride! The only person who changes is the mom, but not the child. Long-standing family and cultural traditions, as well as the wisdom of elders is mocked in this movie, in exchange for doing \\"what I want\\" and \\"following my heart\\". Where's the chivalry in that?<br /><br />Moms, if you want your daughters to learn how to talk back to you and become more selfish, have them watch this movie.<br /><br />Dads, if you want your children to see you as nothing more than a buffoon with no real authority, have them watch this movie.<br /><br />I'm disappointed with Pixar. They had set a standard for classy movies, but this felt more like Shrek to me. Want your kids to see images of bare backsides and cleavage? It's all in this \\"family\\" movie. Tasteless humor, and promoting selfishness with no lasting consequences.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I have this Amazon MP3 app- but have the Amazon Cloud also. I think I buy the music here at Amazon MP3 and LISTEN to it on Amazon's Cloud Player (both on my laptop and android)  I like the way the whole thing is set up as music I like is usually in Recommendations and available in full album or by individual song and if available the video can be purchased or other versions of a song ( as in LIVE, Sessions, etc).<br />I cannot compare it to any others than another I use on my laptop - which never has good suggestions for me and lists EVERY song made since radio waves, with words I use in Search!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best PBS program I've viewed since The Duchess of Duke Street back in the late 70's. Writing is brilliant, cast is amazingly talented, editing is perfection. And what a story line!!  I'll be sad when it eventually comes to an end.
B004GFN11A|4.0|I like the accessibility the WordPress app has on my Kindle Fire. Fairly quick to upload and get started, it is good on the go blog feature to have.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Long awaited Temple Run 2 is definitely worth the wait!! I really enjoy the graphics and the addition of the coal mines makes it really cool!!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|There is not a lot to be desired with this app.  The functionality almost makes you go find a laptop or PC to get the information you need details for to look up groups or other people to network.  If you just need to know what's happened recently or a an update to your own profile, it's fine for that.
B008CJ0KBU|4.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this show.  Has a female super hero of sorts.  She is fae, so has special powers.  She is a sucubus, which means she can suck the life out of someone.  She also has the ability to touch someone and have them fall under her spell.  She is a good guy though, so uses her powers for good.  There is a power struggle between the good fae and the bad, so the underlying theme is good against evil.  Both sides want her to choose which side she is on, which she refuses to do.  Her trusty side kick is well cast and sometimes steals the show.  Her on again, off again love interest is intriguing.  I liked this show, although they tend to focus too much on same sex relationships and sex in general.  Some nudity and bad language, plus lots of bloody scenes.  So this is not recommended for children.  Check it out.  You may enjoy it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Uploading and verification is really easy and not an ordeal at all.  I'm still working with the whole Pinerest concept, but the app itself is no problem and will guide you through the set-ups.  Very cool!
B008XG1X18|2.0|Pinterest is great and this app looks great on the kindle fire HD. There is one major problem that needs to be fixed and is even preventing me from using this app until it is. When pinning pins, you can not put them onto different boards. Please fix!
B000I9YWDO|5.0|It is as hilarious now as it was the first time but now in beautiful HD. The transfer is seamless and the quality impeccable! Great buy at an AMAZIMG price!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Best decision I ever made. Now I can watch whenever I want.  Already have all seasons now 1 through 9.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A must see for music fans!  Beautiful, thoughtful, and inspiring as well as a quiet condemnation of the music industry.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Excellent soundtrack of an expectional movie that should have won the Academy Award because both Jake and Heath were phenomenal in their roles.  The soundtrack is another extension of this unique love story that will be viewed by movie historians for decades to come as the standard that must be adhered to in order to prevail.  Heath's lasting performance can only remind us of James Dean and the death of a legend before his time!!!
B00B2EWNWG|2.0|Not at all what I expected from this movie.  Poor action scenes, boring characters and no real flow to the movie. The critics were right on this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book for the most part. It was a little slow in the beginning, but Improved greatly toward the middle. I couldn't put it down after that.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I don't understand why this doesn't come with every Kindle, it is a necessary item.  Works great for me now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Masterpiece PBS did it again.  What a great series.  I can't wait for the next episode!  'Just when you think all is well they add an unexpected delicious twist.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My favorite show.  Well acted and good storyline.  I love the characters and interactions.  I also like that the people have real problems and sorrows like the rest of us.<br />N
B009EHDU7U|3.0|I was very entertained for about 1/3 of the book.  After that I found it tedious and was very glad when I had finished it. The historical facts skimmed over and made to fit the story of Allan were shallow and unworthy of mention.  His 'partners in crime' I found to be annoyingly mischievous for an adult reader.  However, the translation was excellent though hardly worth the effort.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I was having problem finding downloaded file before i got this app. Es file has solved my problem. Thanks for the app
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book has given me the tools to analyze my most engrained habits, develop a means to test and alter habits which have kept me from achieving goals.
B007NZDES0|5.0|This is a really great showcase of Sade's talent. HIGHLY recommend to even a passing fan. She's a power house!

1451648537|5.0|very late review for this one....bought the book before it was released here in UAE...very nice book! thank you so much
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it the settings Change you can play on it for ages a good time filler! I love this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers! Wow! Its an awesome game! You have creative characters in their own way. You can buy cool and awesome hoverboards.Mostly, once and a while they will have you at different places, like Rio and New York. During those times there is an limeted charachter. They usaly cost ninety five thousand coins. So just dodge those barriers and trains and just run.You will have daily challenges and mission or X's. More X's equals highscore. You can usaly get this app in any app store, but remember its touch screen. So play Subway Suffers!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It's turning out to be a great season so far. Just curious as how the Beckett and Castle secret fling is gonna last lol
B0086700CM|1.0|This is so easy and just silly stupid app. All you do pretty much is jump a few times and go under stuff a few times.. YOU SHOULD TRY  TEMPLES RUN 2. IT IS MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!
0937381888|5.0|A must read for any home brewer. Nothing ground breaking for an experienced brewer, I've been doing it for a couple years and still pick it up and read. Great reference for any level of brewer.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game Subway Sufers Rio,and the other subway sufers it is so much fun I want to hug the game
B004HD61KE|5.0|Great book. Very interesting. Fast paced and high drama. Good book for a Sunday by the fire. Holds your attention till the end.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Subway Surfers is an amazing game, but it's BORING and there is NO ACTION . This Game Is for LAME PEOPLE . And Old Ladies .
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I got this set for my birthday. I have been a Beatles fan since I was 2 and saw them on the Ed Sullivan show. Growing up I bought the albums as Capital reissues. But this set sounds better than any Beatles albums I had before. And the included just makes it that much better. I have heard other reviews from people who had problems with the sets they purchased, but I am just enjoying mine totally. I am really glad to have it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|What great return of the Ryan era,I recommend this book t ok all the Jack Ryan readers it is right up there with executive order orders
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A story well told. A story that leaves in its wake the realization that we are all capable of acts of great good and of great evil. And that our lives are a brilliant multi-colored tapestry in woven in muted shades of grey.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Haha this is a great app ... u will love it I  u take a lot of pics of ur self:) AMAZED!!!! U would never believe how eazy it is to use this app.... u will be so exited that u foot a cool camera too cuz u can take a pic and then edit it
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Me and my daughter have always loved Ponyo.. She watches it several times a week.. Great movie. We also have howls moving castle. All of Hayao Miyazaki's movies are amazing. We are going to buy more soon!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good game, fun to play. The fact that it constantly wants you to post on Facebook is slightly annoying though. Hard to get investment points.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Very relaxing but still some issues ... keeps throwing me off and cannot &#34;visit&#34; friends because I &#34;am supposedly not on the Internet. Still ... a cute game and will be better when they get the bugs out.
159413586X|5.0|Awesome book! I'm a tad disappointed by the end, but I'll get over it. The story was intense, and this last book was the climactic wrap up that left my muscles stiff, my breathe short and me crying way too often!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I had never heard of this toy until my wife brought it home for the kids -- apparently they have the two earlier/easier editions at their school.<br /><br />This is an addicting and satisfying physical toy that is as engaging to my kids (9 and 6) as any video game, which as a parent, is incredible. We find ourselves in impromptu family game circles passing it around and taking turns, cheering each other on.<br /><br />The premise is simple: guide a small metal ball around tracks that bend and twist through the orb using balance, fine motor coordination, patience, and the right touch and dexterity. In addition to a main track -- a dastardly affair with rails, tracks with steps, teeter-totters, tunnels, holes and more -- there are several practice runs you can also take.<br /><br />The design of this toy is impressive -- kudos to the company for creating a great balance between challenge and enjoyment. And packing it all ingeniously into a sturdy, see-through ball, that rests in non-play times on a small plastic stand. Tiny engraved step numbering -- 1 through 125 -- guides you in the right direction through this puzzle toy.<br /><br />The only flaw is that this numbering is a little hard to read. Most times it's pretty intuitive what your next step is. However, there are times when seeing which way you will have to go next helps out, as would the ability to better plan ahead.<br /><br />Great fun for everyone, across a broad range of ages, proving (in an instance that is unfortunately rare these days) that an old school, hands-on interactive toy can be as much, if not more, fun than one that requires joysticks and a video screen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a good game but every time i go to join game it never find someone to play with. Im usually tring to join at lke 4 o clock pm on week days.

0061122416|3.0|I was encouraged to read this book by a member of generation X. Apparently, it has inspired  a number of them to chuck everything if they're not happy at work or in life to \\"follow their dreams.\\" I agree that too many people get tied down way too young and do nothing to escape drudgery the rest of their lives. But this recommended swing may be too far in the other direction. Although the main character had a good relationship with his parents growing up, he never contacts them or seems to miss them through years of wandering. I bet they miss him, though. This is a bit too self-centered for my liking. People all have connections and obligations that don't preclude the pursuits of self-interest, but should be tempered by empathy and consideration for others. In my generation, everyone read Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet. Very similar. Unfortunately, life is too complex to reduce it to simple truisms. Plus, the author is so thoroughly religious that anyone with a less religious bent feels excluded. So, while I liked the author's beautiful yet unaffected writing style, I didn't like the book.
B008220DGE|4.0|Have seen this twice now. First time was utterly baffled and not too interested in thinking about the film. Second time a nearby IMAX was showing the 70mm so I figured it was a good enough excuse to go see again since PT Anderson is one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />After the first viewing, I was struck by how someone who had created such meticulously plotted and thematically rich films seemed to have taken two of the most explosive subjects (war and faith) and made a minor wisp of a nothing of a movie. As I watched for a second time, what emerged as the dominant subject was the trauma WWII heaped on our planet. Now it seemed wise instead of arbitrary to film in super rich and deep 70mm since what we were seeing in these two men was either extreme of how our species could psychologically swallow the war on the Nazis. One path leads to beastly indulgence, the other to self-deluded denial of our animal nature.<br /><br />Just like greed and God seduced each other in There Will Be Blood, so does utopia and anarchy in this film. Of course, these things can't be together and after one last attempt to lull the beast with song, the movie simply stops. By nature the movie is unsatisfying, so if that sounds to you like a dumb aspiration for a movie, steer clear. I loved it, will probably watch it many times just like all his weird-ass movies.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Saw this on TV and enjoyed the location, the pace, and the relaxed good humor. Always like Russel Crowe in movies and it's good to see him do a lighter one.  Not spectactular, but if you want to just have some fun with out having to think about a message or some hidden agenda this is a good one.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Just a fantastic show this takes place in DC's earth-31 and is one of my personal favorites as it depicts Bruce/Batman as I think he would act most accurately if a billionaire kid did see his parents getting killed and did become a superhero with a fetish for bat-stuff. I love all things batman and I don't mean this review to sound demeaning its just that if you read Batman and robin the boy wonder ALL STAR which is the supposed past that takes place before his retirement that he comes out of in part I. Either way after you see how he acts in those comics and you find out who the enemy is at the the end it kind of scares you when you watch this version of batman within that context.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Besides being slow, the download kept messing up and finally had to give up on it--but never went back to it before the 24 hours was over--a waste of $3.99
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have read just about every book in the Mitch Rapp series. The Last Man is right up there with the best, and is on the edge of your seat reading. It helps to have read other books in the series because most of the characters from his past show up in this book. This book would make a fabulous movie, but that can be said for most of the Rapp books.
B001DWNUCO|3.0|Movie quality is not as what I expected as a Blue Ray disk. It can be done better just take a look at what 20 Century FOX did to the James Bond firm! I am very disappointed about this Blue Ray disk.
0307165485|5.0|my son is 2 1/2 and he loves this book. he studies the busy pictures. this book keeps him quietly occupied for as long as any toy, with sweet stories and helpful lessons/illustrations about colors, numbers, months of the year, etc.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Highly recommend this charger. The charger that came with my kindle started acting up so I purchased this one. It works great !
B008PPUMVY|4.0|You already know how great this album is, so I won't ramble on about that. All I want to say is that \\"Sy Borg\\" is one of the greatest Frank Zappa compositions, and it's completely overlooked. Yes, it's completely twisted and licentious lyrically, but listen to the melody! It's insanely beautiful! Along with songs like \\"Punky's Whips,\\" \\"Sofa,\\" \\"Let's Make the Water Turn Black,\\" and \\"I Promise Not to Come in Your Mouth,\\" it displays perfectly the dichotomous nature of Zappa compositions: Inimitable musical beauty coupled with salacious or ridiculous imagery.<br /><br />But why four stars instead of five? Well, I gotta be honest. I always skip over \\"Outside Now\\" and \\"He Used to Cut the Grass.\\"<br /><br />Other than that, Joe's Garage is pretty much perfect. \\"Stick it Out\\" and \\"Keep it Greasy\\" may make you uncomfortable the first time around, but you'll get used to it. It's good for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the third season but it was too short.  Hopefully we don't have to wait another year for season 4.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I have been watching Vampire Diaries for years now. I have to say coming from the 1st season to the 3rd and now the 4th its a huge difference! The show has such a good story pulling you in while every episode you watch is a good episode. The 3rd season takes this to a whole new level and will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I recommend this show to anyone who likes a compelling story with great action a emotional engagement. This show can pull in just about anybody.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love this game and hate this game! Oh how I wish I could beat it so the little piggies would stop sneering at me.this is so fun that I have to make myself stop playing it.  Whoever thought up Angry Birds is a genius.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I found this very difficult to follow because I couldn't judge when 2 notes on opposite sides of the screen should be played in relation to each other. Slower tempos are actually not helpful because the melodies are more difficult to follow. I also had trouble hitting the right keys as the keyboard rolled over to accommodate a higher or lower section - or really anytime since the keys are smaller than my fingers. Kept hitting adjacent keys. Feel like it would be easier on a larger screen that might not need to roll and/or could have larger keys (I have a 7&quot; Kindle fire).
B0063IH60K|5.0|Totally addicting solitaire game...like the cards, but better. You don't have to shuffle...it keeps a running tally if your stats...you can &#34;undo&#34; if you don't like the card you just played. It keeps score of each game, so you can try to beat your last score. I kove thia version of solitaire.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is so fun! The only bad thing is that you have to buy atom Zeus twin cities black Jack etc. Get this game right now!

B008XG1X18|5.0|Makes maneuvering the site easy. Just started and it is great fun. Has stuff for every interest you can imagine. It's a hoot learning lots of things you always wanted to do. Terrific app and it is free. Easily downloaded from Amazon to my kindle and the fun started immediately.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|The book was good for the most part. The ending was a little disappointing but the story line was good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is awesome. Free app from Amazon was easy to get. Great fast paced fun. Challenging and great way t entertain yourself. Love it.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Amazing performance for real blues aficionados..great to see The Stones a bit in awe of the great Muddy Waters.  Performances by Buddy Guy, Junior Wells and John Primer are worth the price in and of themselves !
B0001VV1GK|5.0|Each of my grandsons has this toy.  They both love to use their cars to go up and down the elevator, up and down the ramp, park their cars, and go through the car wash.  This is durable and will last for years.

B00B2V66VS|2.0|The save me option behaves sporadically. When tries to use the option it shuts down the app and have to start over.<br />All the objectives achieved in that game are gone and more over the save me life's are are gone for good. I had 6 save me and now I see only 2.<br /><br /> This will happen quite often and is very frustrating ,sometimes you will not loose the saves but the objectives achieved are gone and the game has to be start over.<br /><br />I am playing this game on kindle he an  unsure if other users are having similar issues with android or Apple.<br /><br />Developers please fix it, wonder how it got passed in Quality Assurance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very fun because you get to own horses and take care of them. You also can enter the. in competitions and win stuff
B00364K6YW|5.0|I need P&P rehab.... To beautiful for words... My favorite novel and my favorite movies. I afraid I cant count the times I have watched them all. The 1980s, the 1995  and the 2004.  And well gotta admit the 1950s cause Mr Darcy there looks more beautiful than all the Lizzies together. Ps after this review I am going to watch that version again.  XD  Seriously!
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|I like the fact of finding out about this app after downloading an older app! This is a great way to keep customers! Awesome app!
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|I regret to Inform that I will draw a lawsuite against Andrea cause every time I hear his voice and music I feel like I die a little for all the beauty of it. By now he has cut my life now by 10 years. This CD is exquisite and NOT for weak hearts.(It should bring a warning label) I bought it cause I am NOT DEAF!!!!. And this is one of the few musical genious that are worth listening in our ERA. I AM GOING TO HIS CONCERT NEXT FRIDAY THE 8TH AT FORT LAUDERDALE AND I AM DRIVING EVERYONE CRAZY ABOUT IT CAUSE I KNOW I WILL CRY AND PROVABLY faint; CAUSE HIS VOICE AND MUSIC CUTS ME WAY! BUT WAY TOOOOO DEEEEEP!!! Thank you Amazon for been so great with your service and it arrived 3 days before I was told so. Thumbs and Big toes UP!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome it's sort of like temple run but it's in a subway, and there's no turning. I would recommend this game to every one, but I must tell you that the crash boards and the characters are pricey, but you pay with them with the coins you earn, not money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game. Test your reflexes<br />Very addictive and sometimes frustrating but good fun<br /><br />My son is much better than me but then that's nothing new. Enjoying trying to get a higher score
B000BW7QX6|1.0|Amazon is generally great for buying physical products.  I use Linux exclusively on my desktop machines. The digital download services such as mp3 download and movie rental seem to fail rather consistently right across the board.  I have given up on any cloud service Amazon offers.
B003TY3F06|5.0|got me started on Tarantino with &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34;. True Romance is an excellent story, and if you are a fellow old fart, you'll probably enjoy this is well.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great purchase and one that you can't stop  watching.  I finished all 13 episodes over the weekend.  I can't wait to purchase Season 2
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is great fun. If you try this you will love the games. The grafects are very vivid clear and easy to see.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Great plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.  You need to watch the first show to get the story plot but I bet you will have it scheduled on your DVR from then on
B009O07NDY|5.0|Great album. Wish I'd gotten something like this for the Lord of the Rings films. Howard Shore does it again.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I can finally walk away from my computer without having to get tangled in wires and still listen to music throughout my house. If you're one of those types who are iffy about spending a hundred bucks or more on a single item, do not hesitate.  This has been by far my best purchase on Amazon.  The sound quality is amazing (however keep in mind that I am no professional when it comes to sound quality rating).  I also game quite frequently.  I play all sorts ranging from puzzles like Portal to shooters like COD.  This headset has helped me in identifying where enemies are with the surround sound.  Many call me a hacker simply because I can hear where they are an anticipate where they're going to be.  Moving onto battery life, this headset will last a good 8 hours before running out.  If it does happen to run out, you just simply have to play wired for a little bit until it charges back up again (usually takes about 2-3 hours for a full charge).  The mic quality is excellent.  My friends haven't complained about \\"waterfall\\" coming from me.  All in all, once this headset dies (if ever), I will probably be purchasing another one.
B000UGS97U|5.0|What you see it what you get. A nice toy item to amuse my wife, who only cares about Star Wars for the big fuzzy Wookie.

0740785508|5.0|This is an amazing book guiding creative, imginative artists into the realm of beautiful fantasy illustration. Imaginative Realism is a &#34;must have&#34; book for all those wishing to break into the demanding world of literary illustration.
B0040UEI7W|4.0|For those interested in the recording as a whole, yes buy it. It belongs in every serious Wagner collection. Great price as well. The orchestra is gorgeous in that early Herbert von Karajan way.<br /><br />I've read in other reviews that interested buyers prefer the bad news to the good during the first few sentences of a critique, so there you have it. For those who want to go more in depth with my personal views read on.<br /><br />This used to be the essential Meistersinger back in the early seventies. The one you borrowed from the Pubic Library and if I remember correctly the first commercial STEREO STUDIO version on the market. There was an earlier stereo recording with Thomas Stewart as Sachs that was never commercially released, at least in the States, for some reason or another in the late sixties and was shelved. A 'live' recording with a dry, nasal sounding Sachs from Otto Wiener (the dry, nasal sounding Herald in Kempe's Lohengrin) and Hans Hotter reportedly suffering from the flu as Pogner. Not a good night at the opera. The Stewart Meistersinger can be found on several pirate releases today and it is THE Meistersinger to have. The late fifties Kempe is the mono version MUST...although some will have reservations about the tenor, Rudolf Schock, who was more at home in the operettas of Lehar. The Domingo Walther of the fifties. (WARNING: not to be confused with the earlier complete Kempe Meistersinger from '51 which is a vocal wobble fest.)<br /><br />The main universal complaint for this recording has always been the Sachs of Theo Adam. His voice has been described as 'too dry', 'too light', 'too grainy' or 'too nasal' for the hearty Hans Sachs. I for one enjoy his portrayal. His is a well-studied, thought out characterization. Much like Dame Gwyneth Jones' much negatively critiqued wobbly Brunnhilde for Boulez. For some strange reason I like it and she is a Brunnhilde to reckon with. To me, she IS Brunnhilde. With Adam the living, breathing character is there. He IS Hans Sachs. Adam also has had experience on the stage having sung it successsfully at Bayreuth. Check out his 1968 stereo'live' Sachs on Orfeo (ironically with Gwyneth Jones as a beautifully sung Eve, sans the wobble.)In comparison with the Bayreuth one can see what Adams was aiming for in this studio recording. He is an Everyman Sachs, worldly though not God-like in voice like Hotter. A second favorite intelligent Hans Sachs is Norman Bailey on the early Solti recording. Fischer-Dieskau is up there, but someone needs to remind him he not singing a leider recital for Jochum. For a kick, listen to FD shamelessly attempt to steal the stage in the Bayreuth Meistersinger from 1956 as Kothner. Way over the top.<br /><br />The only serious problem I have with this recording is a technical one. It basically sounds like a series of recording sessions carefully slapped together. Church scene with Walther and Eva to David and Walther scene, etc. Not a complete whole. Like it was recorded one scene a day in long takes. Difficult to explain, but on first hearing it is noticeable and becomes irritating.<br /><br />I have no problem, as others do, with Rene Kollo who eventually became THE Heldentenor of the seventies after this recording. He was featured in nearly every Wagner and Germanic Decca recording during that era. From Freiscutz to Fledermaus (for Klieber) to Parsifal. The 'Kollo Years' if you please.<br /><br />Donath is 'cute' but a little too 'girly' for my taste in Evas. Very good and passable. Like Elisabeth Schwarzkopf on steroids. Eva is, after all, an intelligent woman. But she is from Wagner's pen...'nuf said. Fortunately not as studied as Schwarzkopf thank goodness. My favorite Eva is Elisabeth Grummer.<br /><br />Now to Beckmesser. Evans plays him as a buffoon-type character. Nothing smart nor intellectual getting in the way of this sly creature. Beckmesser is in the Mime (Siegfried) technique of singing. If he is as Evans sings him how did he ever get in the music guild in the first place? He should be sung as an intelligent and serious danger to Evas hand in marriage. What if Walther never showed and Beckmesser won the contest? What of Eva? Married to a buffoon? Beckmesser is an intelligent, though conniving, creature. I feel Hermann Prey in Wolfgang Wagner's video production had the right idea at Bayreuth. As did Weikl (a soon-to-be Sachs) for Solti. Beckmesser's character was after all based on a famous critic, Hans Hanslick. A sort of Wagnerian parody.<br /><br />That ends it. Back to the beginning since it's always best to start there. Should you buy it? YES! The price is right and your collection complete.r get in the music guild in the first place? He should be sung as an intelligent and serious danger to Evas hand in marriage.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing. Couldn't put it down! Would recommend to anyone loves love stories and kind of action, or intensely described scenes. I could imagine the whole book as if I was watching a movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is simple yet fun. It allows the player to take care of a somewhat realistic looking horse. You can feed groom train and other things. If you want a very exciting game this isn't for you but if you want a simple relaxing game then try this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finished the book in 2 days. Good ending to the trilogy. Again I couldn't put this book down!  Hunger games are great!
1591844096|5.0|Wow, simply mind-bending. Take what you think you know about how the world works and toss it out the window. Seth Godin challenges - and slays - so many myths of what makes a person valuable in today's work environment. The sooner one reads this in life, the better.
B004GYY714|5.0|Needed something where radio is not available.  Has a nice choice of music stations and sounds good. Glad I got this app.
0062238868|5.0|Yesterday, Kyle was murdered while working with Vets at a gun range.  I loved the book, and hope that continued sales will help his family with their needs.<br /><br />Prayers go out to them.
1574216988|5.0|This book is way over the top.  When I saw it on Amazon I knew it was a perfect gift for my artsy granddaughter.  When I got it, it was hard not to order one for myself.  When Christmas came and my granddaughter opened it and looked through it she was so grateful - this is a hard to please girl - I was thrilled.  It is challenging yet not hard for anyone to do.  Wonderful!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|My son bought this on his Kindle during a family vacation.  I finally got a around to reading it several months later.  It is a very well told story and quite interesting.  I found it to be one of those books that you think about for a while after you are done reading it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wow. What a series.  I learned about it from a friend and bought the first season.  Then subscribed to Showtime because I couldn't wait for it to come out again on dvd.  Excellent purchase.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is a page turner that I have read until finished the book. I have read it on vacations and recommend it because the plot is just great from the beginning until  the last page.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Kept me reading I can see this type of reading might not be for everyone!  Could be a little quirky for some.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway-surfers is my favorite game.I very much recommend it. Subway-surfers does a world tour were you go to different places.If only you got to pick the places!
B004KD5TQI|4.0|My brother loves buying movies and he added Sucker Punch to his collection.  I have to admit that the movie is kind of crazy but the music is awesome, I bought the soundtrack a few weeks ago and I like it.
B009XTF8KQ|2.0|In my mind somewhere I was thinking that because Sam Raimi and Company were connected to this film that it would deliver the goods.<br /><br />It didn't deliver at all to get to the bottom line very quickly.<br /><br />At one point in the movie I recognized at least 4 clips that I have watched on YouTube over the years. They are still available to watch on YouTube. Just type in \\"demonic possession\\" and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />With that being said I felt like the production didn't put forth as much effort as it could have.<br /><br />It's not a complete and total stinker but it sure doesn't miss it by far.<br /><br />The best part of this whole deal for me was the special features. There is a segment which tells the true story of the actual Dibbuk box the movie was based on.<br /><br />Interesting to say the least the lengths the current owner went to in order to attempt to \\"control\\" whatever is assocated with the box.<br /><br />This is just my opinion on the movie.<br /><br />Other people might absolutely love it.
B00005NB8K|4.0|Is a good movie but kind of weird for some parts; I like the acting very much, the actors did a very good job.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|WATCHED SOA SEASON 4. IT SEEMS THE WRITERS HAVE REALLY TURNED IT INTO A FAR-FETCHED SOAP OPERA..OF COURSE ITS BEEN THAT SINCE EPISODE ONE,RIGHT(?)..NUDITY,SEX,TONS OF VIOLENCE,THE AMERICAN WAY..A LITTLE UNREAL AT TIMES..
0765325950|5.0|It was worth the wait!  Brandon Sanderson did an excellent job of completing Robert Jordan's series.  I've actually started the series from Book 1 in Kindle edition - hopefully by the time I get to &#34;A Memory of LIght&#34; it will be available in Kindle format.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have had this app for a long time with no problems! I downloaded it when I first got my kindle and now I have it on my cell phone too!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of my favorite dramas..I couldn't wait to see icon the television since the US is slow to show it!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Great book and movie.  Read it to middle school social studies class.  Also, a small group of boys are reading it as a literature circle;  they loved it!
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|Don't bother watching. Paranormal activity 4 is a disgrace to the series. No \\"jumpy\\" moments, no suspence, and a horrible storyline. Save your money and even if it was free save your time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read a lot of negative reviews. I personally thought it was a great story about his time in the military and his life.
B009K916ZK|5.0|The adapter is of good quality.  It allows me to easily connect my MacPro to my large Dell wide screen monitor.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this for my 7 year old grandson for his Kindle and he loves it. It is as much fun as the first one and a little more challenging.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The third installment, and I still love the Batman. This franchise raised the level of quality of comic book movies, and they have set the bar for all who follow them.

B005G5PPGS|4.0|Would recommend to any fan of a small market team!<br />Michael Lewis makes this subject engaging even with all of the technical content.
B008OOYALE|1.0|It's good, but you cannot move objects where you need them to go. It also takes to long to buy food and habitats.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Okay fun game for kindle fire. Especially now that they have the world tour. Everyone should have this game on their kindle fires.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was like glee, but actually good =)I loved the singing and the songs. I could watch it again and again.
B004OZZ624|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed The next three days because the plot was good, kept you guessing, and was really suspenseful.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Depends on what you like really, but I realy enjoy this band and this cd has a lot of great songs on it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I put thid calc on my Kindle Fire for those times I need some quick numbers. Ya did good. Ez to use.
0061122416|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and loved it so much that I had to buy my own copy.  This book really opens up your world to all kinds of possibilities within yourself.  Personally I loved it and would recommend it.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Great store. I wish it was a little longer. However short as it was I still enjoyed it. I've been a fan of Stephen king for years.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|If you are a Mayer fan then you will like it.  I think there are only one or two songs that I am not too fond of on this cd.  All in all it is a good buy.  He's a great artist.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Loved this book. It was funny and sad and very well written. I recommended this book to my friends. Great title.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Sharp, smart female character. Original plot with her background and her ability to overcome. I liked that the story made me feels sympathy for her, yet she was no shrinking violet waiting to be saved. The meet and greet between the two main characters was hilarious as well.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Funniest Movie i've seen in a long time LOVE IT!!! Just remember just because it has a Taddy Bear it is not kid friendly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game<br /><br />I am staying up very late playing this it's addictive I don't think I'll be going to bed anytime soon lol everyone should be playing this
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I mean the original Dallas.  It is fun seeing the differences (and similarities) between royalty and the common folk, all living in the same house.  I feel like a voyeur sometimes.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game was amazing but had a few problems. First my Kindle Fire wouldn't load it for a week after purchase. Second it doesn't always read your taps correctly I had a new record young but it read my jump as a powerup use. Overall this is a good free game.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I bought this app for my daughter but find I am playing it more than her nowadays! I enjoy trying to build up coins while she is asleep or at  preschool.  I don't enjoy not being able to buy some ponies unless you have a social network or spend a goodnamount of real money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really liked subway surfers. The thing that keeps it interesting is the world your the different settings really make it more interesting.this game is amazing.
B001R55VWE|4.0|Crudup and Blanchett's chemistry will draw you in. Unfortunately, Crudup is almost an oversight in the list of supporting actors yet his [supporting] role is such a huge part of the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really bad I'm addicted I play for  probably an hour a day at least<br /><br />I love it so much
B004I2K4E8|5.0|We loved it.  It was all we could hope for and they even have the ogrinal cast come out at the end to sing also.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|As an adult, I thought the movie was sweet. Good for kids and good lessons to get from this. Great computer animation! Every lock of her hair flowed so naturally. I was pleasantly impressed.
B004XQO90O|5.0|The movie was very interesting. A little slow at first but definitely builds quickly. The movie really keeps you engaged.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|What a surprise to read about the suicide in the beginning of the book. I was riveted once I got into the THEN and NOW chapters
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I love this TV show! The acting is just outstanding,and i love that every year the actors get to play different characters. I really loved that they did not just focus on supernatural as horror but even the horror of what its like to lose your mind,or think that your losing your mind,and the horrors of how so many people are treated just for their differences.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a classic style arcade game right at my fingertips. For free! Love the nice flow and realistic physics and graphics.
1451627297|5.0|( almost) I already know this is (well, how can one say best? He is the master of so many genres. The only better short story writer of the last fifty years is Raymond Carver- and that's a close one) one of his best best books ever. I will not say the best... because I haven't read the new Dark Tower, and there are a few I need to reread. I agree with one writer who called him the Charles Dickens of our age. I tend to skip some gory parts in his books (and I will admit, I have not had the urge, ever, to reread Christine.. although maybe it deserves another look...)<br />Where King excels, and as a writer, that facet of his talent I admire most, is his innate, intuitive understanding of people- both as individuals and as a species. I just read Tommyknockers last week and was struck, again, my his portrait of Gardiner.<br />I was expecting his skill to decline- but his work deepens every year.<br />I suppose I might not like the ending but I can say this- 2 days of reading in every spare moment (and 2 migraines to show for it) and despite the horrific -need dim lights- nausea- eyestrain, piercing headaches... I  Still Can't Stop Reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome I've played it forever and it never gets old. I recommend this game to everyone who likes temple run.
0810979772|5.0|Good reading for young and old. Good learning book. Price was good. I may get more in the future for my grandkids.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I have a lot of Christmas music and choose carefully when buying more but if Rod sings it, I buy it!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I loved this game it was lots of fun. You need the hint button a lot  because you have  to go back to random past locations at odd times, but it's a great game.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Don't watch this movie if you can't handle it. It's serously over the line in a lot of dirty ways. But it's funny.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This version of the Bible allows me to move quickly to another book, chapter, and verse like none other I have on my Kindle Fire.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Why does it have to end!?!?  It's hot, sexy, sweet, captivating,  heavy, loving, and such a great story!! Wow__ I couldn't put it down. Awesome read!!!!
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Talented, passionate... no description adequately describes Joe Bonamassa at work.  The musicians are &#34;one&#34; in soul and body of musical excellence.
B0018PH3L0|4.0|I bought this product for my Dad who enjoys watching westerns and other movies. He has enjoyed this and it arrived in good time.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|So happy Amazon has made available all these wonderful cd's to buy.  Also if you purchase the whole album you get mp3 songs ready to download immediatly by using their cloud player. It will download to any device you have. I love it. Will be buying my music here from now on!
B0091V6TF4|4.0|If it's 50 years of JAMES BOND ... then, why wasn't SKYFALL added to this CD?<br />Or even &#34;The Look of Love&#34; or &#34;Never Say Never Again?&#34;
B002RV01QI|5.0|I did not know I could come here and get cd's of Enya - plus if you buy the album they make the mp3 music available right away to download - you can even use their player. So wonderful. Will be buying my music here from now on!
B009K45Y62|5.0|I just wished it was cheaper and not sold out before it hit the market the day it came out on blu-ray.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Close to the intensity of twin peaks a good read.<br />Glad to see a new twist on an old subject.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the best things we've seen on TV in many years!<br />Thanks for a job well done - looking forward to next season!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THE GAME its so AWESOMENESS yA i didnt make sense because it's that awesome hey this freakin game
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is the first and best of the Narnia books.  CS Lewis is the best children's books writer and reading the novel beats watching the movie hands-down.  Perfect for younger grade school children, this is a magical and lyrical story, full of imagination, wit and wonder.  No complicated ''dark'' subplots or unnecessary romances, it's just a really good story with characters that you will love.  A real keeper!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My God yes it's finally here got it 5 minutes ago and already played 168 games . But you know I still think that temple run 1 is better than  temple run 2 in some ways.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|Very funny and good story. A<br />Little romance, cooking, career, intrigue, good reading.<br />Love her books, keep up the good work
B0042UEU8M|4.0|A story of losing a loved one is always heartbraking, specially a child. I have seen losing a loved one from a parents perpective, but this first time a see it with a hurting older sibling.<br />Zac Efron did a wonderfull job, I will recomend this movie for ages 13 and up.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This was great.  A gift for my husband and he loves it.  He is not much of a gadget person but this device is easy for him to use on the golf course and he uses it frequently to know exactly how far he is from the flag.  No guessing whether the flag is in the front, center or rear of the green because the device uses the flag to check the distance.  Has it with him every time he is on the golf course.
B00ABXA1HI|2.0|This app would be great and very useful if it were in fact free like it was offered in the download. Unfortunately it is only free when you use it on the same wireless network as your home computer. An additional fee of $16.99 per year is required if you want to use it outside your home network. I thought that is what I was getting. I would have liked to know that before I downloaded the app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can always find an interesting subject to pursue when looking through the Pinterest posts.  Anything from healthy recipes to decorating to hair styles to craft projects.  Pinterest on my Kindle Fire can be carried anywhere there is wi-fi service.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This script has been floating around in Hollywood ever since the late 1980's, even before Disney bought the Burroughs' rights.  If you've read the John Carter series books, then this one does not disappoint, otherwise it will leave you wondering ... huh?
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|heard about the first season , watched it, was instantly hooked i have watched all of asylum and am looking forward to the third season hif they continue
1781161097|5.0|Get inside the the mind of Ridley Scott as he reprises the Alien series.  The art, concepts and storyboards show you the tools the creators use to achieve filming a film such as this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is listed for teens but it's appeal is broad. It is one of the most memorable books I have ever read. The characters are so real and likable but the story is heart wrenching without being maudlin or sad. I had no idea what it was about but bought it because it had so many 5 stars. It hooked me from the first page and just kept getting better and better. It's a quick read and I recommend it for everyone. Don't be put off by it being a youth book. It's a brilliant story and so well written.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Especially if you are an ALIEN aficionado, this one goes back to the beginning.  Why we came to be ... why the ALIEN creature figured big and nasty even back then.  How it all unraveled and went wrong does not disappoint.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle fire and I love it. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first on one but this one is great! I'm addicted. :)
B005IF7HNA|5.0|This is a spinoff of the Dr. Who Series, including Captain Jack.  A real quality show and fun to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I brought this product I barely ever used it. But when they started there world tour I used it more. I like how they change the senirie cop and dog with each place they move
B0009P5YXO|5.0|While not exactly like the Doctor's intriguing tool, this little buddy shows friends and foes alike that you are capable of exercising  the same kind of moxie and grit the real Doctor uses to get out of a pinch.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|very well written account of horrible incident.  jumpsback and forth from past to present keeping it interesting. Characters are easily identifiable.
B00139XZF4|5.0|I think this movie used every cinematic trick in the books ... except maybe for stop-motion-animation ... just maybe!  Decidedly Steampunk-centric, it paints a fantasy-laden world only existant in film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Better than temple run 2 and temple run  combind is possibly best free game ever made. Is constintly coming out with great updates
B0016MZFXS|5.0|I collect R2s and I like this. A lot of vocalizations. But don't plan on it projecting across a room.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Disappointed.  Panther did not spark my interest and I have not finished the book.<br /><br />  Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors, looking forward purchasing the book.  I plan to finish the book, but not in a hurry.<br />John Corey's one-liners were cumbersome.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game! 100% Free Note does require a 10 minute download requirement but Otherwise Fantastic recommend to any animal lover!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I hope there is a sequel.  This story grabs a hold and doesn't let you go.  I highly recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of my friends at work recommended this book to me.  She had already read it and wanted me to read it so we could go see the movie when it comes out.  I love a book that I can't put down.  My family hates it because no one gets fed, the house doesn't get cleaned and the laundry doesn't get done, but I usually read them fast so they don't have too long to wait. :)
B008FPIPR2|5.0|Fun movie for the family.  Great casting and acting except for Julia Roberts who can't act.  Miss Collins is sweet and cute.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is fun and addicting. The only problem with it is it crashes in the middle of a run. Needs to be fixed for better review.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|It's really enjoy this game. Others have reported problems with it shutting down on the Kindle HD but I've never had a problem. Enjoy!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun and free takes u back to the festival days and all the wasted quarters :) I would recommend it to anyone
B0098VXE50|5.0|There are three or four Snow White movies making the rounds right now.  Having seen all of them, this is by far the darkest.  Charlize Theron plays Ravenna (the &#34;Queen&#34;) exceedingly well as a man hating, husband eating villain.  Chris Hemsworth almost overshadows Snow White as the huntsman.  This is definitely not a &#34;children's rendition&#34; of this timeless classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. Just waiting for the 0.6.0 update :D But the game is GREAT. Just build with your imagination and have fun!
B00ARAO720|3.0|Girl posts important package, boy tries to deliver it, bad guys try and stop him, surprise - happy ending.  The entire movie is pretty much chase scenes on a bicycle.  If you can't lose a car in city traffic, you aren't trying.  There are some fun one liners and stunts.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I think this was an excellent read for tweens and teens. I enjoyed it more than the first, Matched, and cannot wait to read the next. The characters and storyline are great. This book had more action and moved quicker than the first. I was afraid it was going to be too much like Hunger Games, but it wasn't!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Mix a really bad bad guy, with a &#34;virtuous&#34; good guy and his rookie partner.  It is everything you would expect from a sequel to &#34;Judge Dredd&#34;.  I actually enjoyed the sequel more than the original.  Lots of futuristic themes, combined with a thin plot line.  Lots of &#34;bang bang, shoot'em up&#34; fun.  There is nothing socially redeeming about this movie, but that is exactly what you would expect from a movie called &#34;Dredd&#34;.
1439102430|4.0|I can only take bones and grisly murders in little doses, but when I want it, I go read either Kathy Reichs or Patricia Cornwell. This novel was interesting, with the description of the diamond trade in Canada - which I had read about in a non-fiction book not too long ago - and well-paced, exciting.  I agree with one of the reviewers, though, and I had forgotten this point - that Temperance always gets kidnapped near the end of the story! I had let enough time go by between books to forget...but come on, change something up, here!  At least have a different person get kidnapped, if kidnapping it must be.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|OK, it won't be nominated for an Oscar or an Emmy, but it was a lot of fun.  There is no attempt at historical correctness, or deep meaning.  It was the story of a US president kicking a55 and taking names.  There actually was a fair amount of character development between the ax murders and the stakings.  Great &#34;B movie&#34; stuff.
B00884GR0W|5.0|My friend says it's stupid but he calls everything stupid I think it is a very cool game they should make more apps like this because all of the other games like this just suck but on this it has very good quality and is not all lag like some other games like that bum Vicky's games they don't just lag but they are just a bunch of sucky pictures or a horrible game that is not even worth buying.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I enjoy the mindless fight scenes and monsters from this series.  If you are a fan, it doesn't disappoint.  If you aren't already a fan, see if you can watch some of the previous shows in the series.  I believe several of them are available free to Prime members.  If you find you like the characters and the plot premise, see this.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|I gre up with Barnabas Collins and Dark Shadows.  This comedy based on a dramatic TV show, combined with period appropriate music was lots of fun for me.  The plot was campy, and the characters were freakish.  Given all that, I enjoyed the heck out of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really fun and enjoyable. I cant stop playing its a never ending game with lots of fun features. I think everybody should get this game.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Lots of guns, cars, and stars.  If your favorite action thriller actor isn't in this movie, you are watching too much Justin Bieber.  Really bad bad guys, really motley good guys.  The plot line is pretty basic - Bad guys attack good guys, against all odds, good guys prevail, but come on, seriously, with this cast you can't go wrong.  I actually liked the plot in the firts movie more, but the cast in the second entry more than makes up for any plot deficiencies.  Have a couple of guys over, and spend they whole movie high fiving each other............. Do NOT force your favorite lady to watch, she probably won't like it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I would say that this game is pretty interesting. I played this game along with my younger brother and we both enjoyed it. it has pretty good graphics and picks at your brain. the only downside is that I had to pay $2.99 halfway through to continue the rest of the game.

The science he has consolidated plus<br />his own personal experience and that of thousands of his patients has<br />solved a world wide mystery that even the most sophisticated minds could<br />not unravel: the epidemic of obese, depressed, diabetic, anxious Americans!!<br /><br />We certainly don't deserve that fate and our grandfathers and grandmothers<br />did not build this empire so that we could expire as overfed, corpulent,<br />unhappy potato couches!! I have been wheat free for 3 weeks and 3 days and<br />I could not be more pleased!!!  I never ate processed foods, I did McDonalds<br />about twice in the last decade, but like many other highly educated people I<br />fell for the \\"whole grain\\" mantra that Agribusiness<br />promotes.<br /><br />Dr. Davis deserves a national medal for uncovering the truth about<br />wheat and the vested interests that market its promotion. He is not like the<br />run of the mill doctor today, who is more like a Wh(*& for the pharmaceutical<br />companies than anything else. Dr. Davis really is a healer and he has provided<br />the science, the path and the knowledge of how to improve our lives to become<br />the healthy, happy Americans we deserve to be!!! The more people that put this<br />knowledge to the test, the better. Just go wheat free for 2 weeks and see the<br />results in your well being that follow.<br /><br />Did I add that Dr. Davis is very handsome and has a really charming sense of humor?<br />Just look at his face; he is a very good person who cares deeply. This book is a great<br />read, as are all of the reviews here on Amazon recounting the success people have<br />had. I am on page 18 of the reviews and plan on reading every one!! Congratulations<br />Americans, the best approach to your health and happiness is right here in this<br />book!!!!!recounting the success people have<br />had.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Good plot line, pretty good character development, lots of spectacular &#34;simulated&#34; action scenes, a bad guy who tries to play &#34;the common man&#34;, a good guy who is convoluted.  The social commentary wasn't needed, but it is definitely a Batman movie.  The testosterone underpinnings are present, but there are enough other aspects to the movie you should share it with your estrogen better half.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Straight forward and easy to use. I really like it. Why pay for an expensive app when this one works great.
0385344333|5.0|I am a huge Child / Reacher nut.  I couldn't wait for this to come out and read it in two nights.  It is everything a Jack Reacher novel should be.  A loner taking on all the evil in the country.  This episode ties back to other books in the series, and I would suggest that you read them in order.  If you understand why Tom Cruise isn't Jack Reacher, you'll love this book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I own Series 1 and Series 2 so am eagerly looking forward to finishing Series 3.  The historic details hold my attention while the story and characters draw me in further.  This series is a delight to the senses, sets and costumes and story and the oh so varied and interesting characters.  I love them all!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Nice try.  Lots of &#34;new&#34; ways to look at the powers of witches and such but besides some sense of confusion there was simply too much going on to keep track of who was hexing whom.  There were moments of intrigue and excitement but it seems that everytime the story line began to make sense - boom - the whole plot changed course.  Every time I read something in this type of genre I always try to see the plot line as a movie.  If it is too complicated to bear a screenwriters pen, then I consider the story to be flawed.  This story would wind up with half of the characters and plot lines on the cutting room floor.  OK for a holiday read or waiting room/airplane standby but lots of chances here to lose interest.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was hooked after the first chapter and couldn't put it down. Going back and forth between Katie's and Kevin's  thoughts gave a very good perspective of why an abuser feels justified in doing what he does.  I also loved the ending but don't want to give away any surprises.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I loved this game, bought it for my grandson who REALLY wanted the black suit (for 20,000 coins) and got into it. Went to level 50 twice and now it won't go any further. Also, it dumps all the upgrades and won't give any more skill points. Please fix!! It's a beautiful game and lots of fun to play but frustrating to lose all progress for no particular reason.<br /><br />***After trying to reach Gameloft customer service both by e-mail and phone, could not. E-mail wouldn't go through and phone said try e-mail!!! My advice is to stay away from Gameloft until they fix the game issues and particularly the customer service issues!!! ***
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This movie, time and time again, captures my twin toddler's attention for just the right amount of time to get a meal made.  Can't ask for anything more.  The tone the Helena Bonham Carter sets, and the pace of the adventure, absolutely grabs the girls imagination.  We have both movies in the series and they are great.
B008N1V11U|2.0|This is a very beautiful game but sooooooo slow! After playing Spiderman, what a disappointment! and an expensive one. My Kindle should play much faster.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie is so well done.  It takes unusual subject, something that as far as I know has never been portrayed in film, and makes it relatable, funny, sad and real.  Worth your time....
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We watch a lot of series on TV.  Downton Abbey is my absolute favorite, but Homeland is a close 2nd and obviously a totally different story and drama.  Actors are good to great.  We thoroughly enjoy it and are sad to see that Amazon is not carrying Season 2 so we will have to find it elsewhere.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|not sure it is going to last.  did a  bunch of knives at once, got some good edges, seems to be wearing down.  time will tell.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just started this series this year and I was hooked!  I caught up with Seasons 1 and 2 and then started 3--I can see why so many people are enthralled with it.  I watched my last one (so far) last night and cried and cried.
B009LMBVTW|5.0|got this album on CD since 20 yrs. on mine is printed \\"Dedicated To Sterling Morrison\\" 'for licensed broadcast use only'<br />Hope this edition sounds better !<br />'Jesus' contains an incredible guitar solo, and the whole cd is one of my favorite VU bootlegs.
B00632HWOG|5.0|awesome, at first it was not very good but know it is amazing! it even sends me alters when I have a new email. great for the kindle fire
B007V9N5R8|5.0|works great and for the money you cant beat it it does what it says and if you use it it will give you great photos
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Although there were some clever ideas like the name Hopeless, I found the bookj trite.<br />The seemingly endless pages of description about the kisses made me wonder if the author<br />was being paid by the word or page.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|recommend to anyone who loves english based programs,  such good acting makes you feel you are there,<br /><br />PLEASE CONTINUE SERIES WITH ANOTHER SEASON !!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is fun but its way to glitchy! it is driving me insane! its like the first temple run. its fun but to glitchy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book captured my attention from the first page. Gillian Flynn's writing pulls you into the story and Its many twists and turns keep it suspenseful.  I highly recommend!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I started reading this book in the afternoon and kept reading until 4:00 in the morning.  I'm looking forward to hearing what my book club thinks.
044024630X|5.0|I listened to this phenomenal book on CD performed by Dick Hill who did a spectacular job of capturing the mood and character of<br />Jack Reacher.<br /><br />This book finds our loner,Jack Reacher, in an affair with a beautiful and equally intelligent Sheriff. Elizabeth Deveraux and Jack actually work as a team in uncovering a killer...but is that killer a soldier?<br /><br />This Jack Reacher addition to the series has Jack romantically involved rather than on his own. Deveraux (as Jack always called her)may have betrayed Jack's trust later in the story. Jack was never one to jump to conclusions before weighing all the facts...and facts is exactly what Jack is after.<br /><br />I find it almost impossible that this book could be lower than 5 stars it was that good. Stayed up all night and could not stop listening to it. An excellent read-don't let it pass you by. This book on CD is equally fantastic.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie had some funny moments and the music is fun, but I don't really get all the hype.  I guess it's more for teens.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was a bit &#34;light&#34;, but had some nice twists and turns to keep me turning the pages.  Sequel...no way!
B00APUQT7I|3.0|I felt like they tried to do too much with this one in a short amount of time.  The seal, however, is laugh out loud hilarious!  Of course, it's Ice Age so it's hard to go wrong, but I expected a bit more.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was so caught up in this story, I had all I could do NOT to skip to the end to see how everything turned out.
0743243153|5.0|\\"The Road Less Traveled\\" is the kind of book which gets better every decade you read it!  I highly recommend it for anyone struggling to figure themselves out.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it was fabulous. it was amazing. it was one of the apps I have gotten. out of a scale from 1 to 10 it was a 2
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I love any film which can bring a strong female lead in, give her a bow and arrow, and let her fight her own battles (with the love and support of her family around her of course).  I also love that the movie shows the imperfections of a budding young woman and her relationship with her mom.  Beautifully done!  I can't wait to see it again!
B002SJKWZ4|1.0|programming simple tasks easy, but to fully use this, it gets complicated. Love the concept, but wish it came already programmed.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|They have outdone themselves this season.  I am so sad that it's over and now I have to wait for Season 3!  Everything is done so spot on....the costuming, script, acting.  I am hooked!
0307744434|5.0|I absolutely adore the imagination of Erin Morgenstern and can't wait to see where her imagination takes her next. Her characters were wonderfully created, yet for me, the star of the novel is the circus itself. This novel is like Harry Potter, for grown-ups. I loved it!
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|This movie was very cute and sent a good message.  There are some very funny laugh out loud moments for both children and parents alike!  Definitely worth renting or buying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and very addictive :D brilliant to spend time on when bored couldn't even put it down sometimes tons of joy
B0095P31L6|2.0|I have seen this movie a few times only because my children are little and they don't have the same standards for things as adults.  Don't get me wrong....I absolutely LOVE kids movies and watch them all the time with the family, but this one isn't good at all.  I don't get it.  It's dark and not in the artistic and fun way.  I just don't get it.
1600595871|5.0|This book is a nice addition for those who love books as well as those wanting good information and good ideas for making books.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I laughed, I cried, It became a part of me!  Seriously.....WHAT A SHOW!  I have never seen a comic book movie done so well.  After watching this, I am sure Batman is real and he's quite the American at that!
B00021HBGS|5.0|I purchased these for my two year old to play with in the shower and she loves them!  They stick great to the wall and she enjoys putting the road together.  The quality is nice and I think I may purchase another theme of these soon.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|My whole family loves watching Tim Burton films and this one is now on the list!  The character voices are done so well (especially Edgar) and I love the parallel to \\"Frankenstein\\" throughout the entire thing.  When you know how much work goes into Burton's creations you are astonished at the quality of the outcome.  Well done!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is like a whole new way to play temple run. I really love the air temple theme. also the mine cart part AWESOME
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I was a bit disappointed in this film.  I thought Christian Bale could have done a far better job, but with that said....WOW!  Heath Ledger was creepy, freaky, and deaky!  ;)<br /><br />This wasn't what I had hoped for a Batman movie, but it wasn't the worst either.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. lots to do. Many horses and a zebra and unicorns!!!!!!! love it. I totally recommend it for u.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so addicting! so much fun, I love it! plus its great for improving you perceptual reasoning ability and processing speed!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Max must have inherited his father's gift for writing, this is a fun, entertaining read for anyone that enjoys the zombie mythos. It reads exactly as a &#34;guide book&#34; should, but contains nice details that flesh out the underlying story. I am enjoying it thoroughly. I just wonder if I can put everything into practice before the coming war...
0884271536|4.0|I've been asked to read this book as a precursor to it being used on projects at work. It is very well written, I've had no problems reading it over one weekend. I feel on one read that I have picked up the key concepts of TOC and critical chain, I now intend on going back over the book, re-reading the classroom sectionas and the TOC discussion making notes. I can see that this is going to be very helpful going forward.
B001N4RORE|5.0|Good mommie and me movie for tweens. We enjoyed the scenery and the music, with Greek mythilogical undertones. I would watching this again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I started playing this game a month ago and can,t put it down. I keep promising to stop when I get 1,000,000 score. We'll see. Great game
B008PQ8XZK|2.0|I read this book as it was my Book Club choice. I would not have read it to the end if it had not been for that. I could see the twist coming a mile off!I would have more than likely skipped to the end just to be sure that I was right. While the writing is quite good it does meander around the place a bit and could do with tightening up. I was  also surprised to read that Laurel got the idea for her hairstyle in 1961 from the &#34;BUNTY&#34; ! I was 10 years old in 1961 and my memories of the &#34;Bunty&#34; are of a comic for younger readers, certainly not one that would have given hairstyle ideas for 16 year olds. Then Dolly was reading the &#34;Woman's Weekly&#34; in the '30's when she was only 15 or 16. This was a magazine that would have been read by older women I would have thought.  The third anomaly that I noticed was the choice of the name Caitlin for Dolly's friend in Coventry when she was in her teens. I doubt very much that there was ever a girl called Caitlin in Coventry at that time, or anywhere else in England come to think of it.There would have been plenty in Ireland where it is the Irish language version of Kathleen and is pronounced more like &#34;Cautchleen&#34;. As far as I am aware this name became popular in the United States after the visit of Dylan Thomas whose wife's name was Caitlin (pronounced Kathleen)McNamara. The Americans pronounced it as they saw it written. It only shows up in England in the 1970's or 80's.Sorry for the long rant but these details really irritated me and got between me and the story.<br /><br />Some reviewers have compared Kate Morton to Daphne du Maurier. I don't think that Ms. Morton compares to Ms. du Maurier at all. But she must want to otherwise why would she have lifted the character of the wealthy woman straight out of &#34;Rebecca&#34;, even down to the crushing of the cigarette in the pot of face cream? Really careless.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was a great book. But before you read it, you cant get caught up in what you liked about the first book. It is just as excelent of a book.
0930289234|5.0|The style of Watchmen harks back to a time before artists used computers to help in their production and it shows in the colours and lettering. Although the art might not appeal to the modern reader, the story is full of intrigue and if you haven't seen the movie, this book will be hard to put down. The way the story is told is also much more complex than most comics, and its heroes are selfish, flawed, sometimes morally apprehensible and ultimately defeated. This was one of the comics that got me reading the medium again as an adult, and it deserves the high praise it gets from literary scholars and the media.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is by far the best WWII movie. It's real. The picture quality is really cool the way it was shot. It looks like what you might think in your mind that era looked like. very good. Sound quality is equally good.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I have it on the computer and iPod touch I know that it's alpha but I can't connect to the Kindle worlds on my iPod touch which is not as fun and it takes longer to get an update on the Kindle than the Apple products
2245267346|5.0|Muy buen libro lo tube en cuba hace algunos anos pero lo perdi ahora lo compre y aunque lo e leido muchas veces en cada una  de ellas aprendes algo nuevo :)
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I got my case about a month ago. I did the water test and there was an air bubble where the headphone jack was and so the case was leaking a lot of water. I contacted the company through amazon and they told me that I can return it to them and they will send me a new one.<br /><br />The customer service I experienced was HORRIBLE. I have to pay for shipping my case back to the company and then wait for another one to come in .. who knows how long this will be. I still have the damaged case because THEY NEVER TOLD ME HOW TO RETURN IT. I feel like I got cheated out of my money because I haven't seen the money returned to me yet. I am usually a happy person with amazon but this pissed me off beyond belief. All I want is another case or my money back and I have yet to get either.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Uncomfortable reading for the most part.  And when not uncomfortable there is a dull story line with a very repetitive dialogue.
0375507256|5.0|This book hits all of my favorite subjects in novels.  It keeps you hanging, wanting to stay up late to find out what happens in the next story.  To discuss the structure of the book which most people wonder about I have to say is unique and makes me like it even more.  You have history, religion and the answer to the question we all wonder.....why are we here?  No, not really but according to the novel it does answer that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|wow this app is incredible!  I love all of the new and fun things that has been added. and yes, it is very addicting and you cant put your device down for five minutes. I love this game!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Deborah Harkness is fairly new to me.  But she hasn't disappointed me.  I have enjoyed reading all of her books so far.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I chose  this rating because as a type 2 diabetic lowering my A1c and daily blood count is important.  I have already after 14 days lover my counts by as much as 50 points.  Can't wait till my next A1c.  They book is easy to read and the directions are so much easier than the old Atkins.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|This is my favorite Simon & Garfunkel album.  And Bridge over Troubled Water is my favorite cut.  They are just so good!
0024181900|4.0|This book was written sometime ago, yet the simplicity is appreciated and the writing styles and tips can be applied today.
B0000024YL|5.0|It's Simon & Garfunkel.  This isn't my favorite album, but it is close.  And anytime I am listening to them is a good time.
0307960471|3.0|Not the very best Jo Nesbo has ever written--seems to take a long time to &#34;get going&#34;, but once it does, it is a good read.
B00005NKKV|5.0|What more do you need to know?  I loved their sound the first time I ever heard them.  I never get tired of listening to them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is worth 7 dollars. there is so many things you can do. does anyone know when version 0.6.0 comes out
B00005R24K|5.0|The movie played flawlessl and everything was included in package. Got the movie sooner than expected. Great job on product and shipment! A++ on everything.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show!  Bringing back the children's stories with an modern twist is just fascinating to watch. Most of us have a history with the children's story and when you add &#34;today's&#34; portion of the story and move back and forth through time to create an ongoing story it is fascinating.  You need to watch two episodes and you will be hooked.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even by just looking at it (I don't have the game yet) I can tell its a very good building game! I have this on xbox but I can carry my kindle around so if I'm bored I can play minecraft :)!
030796664X|5.0|I could realistically say that this book actually changed my life for two months and my thought processes forever.  I bought two copies for friends.  It is smart and tells you things everyone should know about themselves, others, and businesses.
B00AATV046|5.0|so now I can watch it whenever I want too.  I guess I shouldn't complain because of the age of the movie but the sound could use improving.
1478230096|5.0|I love this book. It is in English and is an easy read.<br />Explanations are simple and clear and it tells the wonderful sad story of redemption and love.<br />I love this play and I also love the movie with Hugh Jackman. Enjoy this classic!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really nice game I am awesome at . It I hope I can find a friend to play with E
0394721780|5.0|It is awesome,user friendly recipes and even though it is a classical cookbook most of the recipes are easily made today.  I will pass on the organ meats, brains and thymus gland recipes though!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Not at all what I expected, captivating from page one.  As ever, thanks Ann, for your spot on reading recommendations.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was very exciting and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  He always writes good books and now I look forward to seeing the movie!
B0071LLHGC|5.0|PROBABLY THE BEST BROTHERS LIVE IN STUDIO EVER AND WITH DUANE !!!!<br />GREAT SOUND AND SONGS !! GREGG VOCALS GREAT AS WELL
1423140605|4.0|Very good third novel in the series. Rick Riordan's writing is engaging even for older readers. That being said the story line and plot are not very deep. It is however a fun read and quite entertaining.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This is one of the Cohen brother's best movies. See it just for the sound track or the great acting by George Clooney, or see it because it tells a story that in one way or another we all share in. I think Mark Twain would have given it five stars too.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The entire collection is great,kept my fourteen yr old son occupied . Cant wait for the next one. Great for family book club. I read each one after my son .and then had a blast discussing it. Great read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to this show!  Can't wait for the next episode! So many twists and turns.....so ver exciting my lady.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this game I spend hours playing it I have even got my children hooked to playing it.  My fiance plays it from time to time
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I had to remove this ap because it would make my tablet freeze, and no picture would be taken, I am still searching for an ap for my camera in the Kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome, can't get much better for free ! I just wish that the characters weren't so much but that just means you have to play more !
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I like reading from the kindle, no torn pages, lost books, always know where it is, just great and I'll order more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun to play to let time go by so what I'm string to say it is really fun.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I really needed this within a few days, should've specified in listing that it would take a month to finally arrive.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I knew this game from a few of my friends who told me to try it on my kindle and that it was free to download.I hope you have fun with the game as much as I did.  Sometimes the creator changes the theme of the game as New York or Rio. ENJOY
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It just seems to LAG and GLITCH when you are doing great and reaching a new high. Like when ducking under something or turning a corner. You fall to your death because of LAG and GLITCHYNESS. Fix this issue and it will be great.
034580404X|2.0|writing to be sophomoric, if you reach acertain age and you have not been exposed to sexually explicit material either by experience or by reading you must be living in a convent.
B006885FZI|5.0|I'm amazed at how well this is done.  The character development was not as intimate as Band Of Brothers, but it was an amazing series.  It was really eye opening to some of the horrors of WW2 and the brutality that went on in the Pacific.  Its definitely worth the watch.
B008G59IBI|5.0|We have been Green Day fans since their first album (cd? tape?).  They write great lyrics and the music makes me want to get up and dance.
0345803507|5.0|it was a bit twisted and some of the sex secenes were repititous but overall when love conquers all its a good book to me!
B000I14UTS|5.0|Often, I have wondered how was it possible for one WWI corporal to bamboozle an entire Nation into the path of her self-destruction, Europe and eventually the world. The answer is so clearly exemplified in the movie Cabaret, which takes place in the decadent Berlin of the 1930s. Maximilian von Heune, the rich and bisexual German baron, so well played by Helmut Grime, summarized it so succinctly: \\"Max observes to Brian (played by Michael York) that `The Nazis are just a bunch of stupid hooligans. ... Let them get rid of the Communists; later we'll be able to control them.' Brian then asked, `who's we?' To which Max added, `Germany.'\\"<br /><br />The movie as a whole is a snap picture of a beautiful and prosperous Nation, which recovered from a time ready to change for the worse. Moreover, the musical score is extraordinary in its own right with some of the songs being unforgettable, with Lisa Minnelli and Joel Gray at their very best.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it forty-years ago when I watched it for the first time, and just recently again but with a touch of nostalgia.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is so great. I can play with my friends and everything they should make a second one it would be great
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|For a game with virtually no action and little strategy required, I can't seem to pull my self away. I'm checking for coin regens compulsively.
B007V65R54|4.0|This books talks about how the collection of data from other collections give a better result for predictions. It is nice because it was used and reported on.
1933952806|5.0|Darrell Young takes photographers on a step-by-step journey through setting up, effectively shooting, and ultimately mastering the D7000.  I have his book, &#34;Beyond Point and Shoot&#34; as well.  I would recommend that book to anyone who is new to DSLR photography.  Other books seem to assume that all readers are professional photographers but anyone can follow Mr. Young's instructions and tips, even more experienced photographers would benefit from his tips.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Started and could not put down till finished.<br />Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is similar in spirit to temple run, but there are enough differences that it stands on its own. Its a ton of fun, addictive, and its great for when you just want to kill a few minutes or just zone out for a bit.  Its the kind of game you get for free, then realize you've played it so much you really do want to send them a few bucks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best running game ever my whole family loves it. I do too. the only problom is the adds but over all I love it
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Good game to pass the time and have fun.<br />Easy to jump in and out of the game when you have nothing to do.<br />I recommend that you try it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game it is loads of fun and It is free. You have lots of stuff that you can do only downside is that I never have enough coins.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun game but it is really hard to tell where to go next without getting hints every time. the hidden object parts are good. it's possible to actually identify the objects.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is extremely fun. It is one of the best games<br />That I have on my tablet. I highly recommend it:-)
B004ZQRJHW|1.0|The record I received was warped! I tried to play it, but to no avail. I don't recommend this for anybody!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Book was fantastic, I had real trouble not reading it during work! I loved all the characters and became very emotionally invested in the storyline. So well written! 5 stars :-)
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This was a great movie - not too predictable, beautiful cinematography.  I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice
0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One is not a book I would normally read, but when I saw it on a trusted book blog, listed in the top ten, I was curious.  She stated the same thing, that it was not a book she would normally read, but it ended up being one of her favorite reads of 2012.<br /><br />It is now one of my favorite reads of 2013.<br /><br />The book takes place in 2044.  Earth is in bad shape, we've ruined the planet.  But luckily there is OASIS.  A virtual place where you can spend the majority of your day, walking around as the avatar of your choice.  OASIS was build by James Halliday, a man with a passion for the 1980's.  In this virtual reality, he has hidden the ultimate \\"Easter egg\\" for gamers to find.  But in order to find it, they must become experts at the 80's, to be able to pass through and beat the puzzles.<br /><br />Wade Watts, or Parzival, as he as known in OASIS, finds the first key.  Instantly his score is broadcast to all of the other gamers, and the hunt becomes more frenzied.  Even though he is a lone gamer, he has a few close friends in OASIS.  Friends he has never met in real life, but whom he spends most of his time with.<br /><br />The story is well paced, the 80's trivia is entertaining, and it is very well written.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome do download so addictive. I recommend to download because its REALLY good and epic!!!! Do download
0307352153|5.0|have always known that I was quiet. Back in high school, on the pom pom squad, I always won \\"The Most Quiet\\" award. It was not until listening to Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain, that I fully realized that I am not alone. Not only am I not alone, but there are other people just like me.<br /><br />I finally feel like I have permission to be me. I don't have to be outgoing. I don't have to like to go to parties. I can embrace the fact that I like to be alone, I like to spend whole afternoons reading. One of the statements in the book that really hit home for me is the differences that extroverts and introverts fell at parties. Extroverts thrive on all the attention and the activity, getting more animated as the evening wears on, whereas parties slowly sap the energy from introverts, making them quieter and quieter as the evening goes on.<br /><br />Not only does the author cover characteristics of introverts and extroverts, she gives some history into what type of personality has been popular though the ages. The importance that society places on extroversion, how softly spoken ideas can be ignored, even when they are the optimal solution. She offers insight to parents and teachers for accommodating introverted children. As a teacher, I was particularly intrigued by the stress that all of this group work puts on introverted children. And as a parent, I realize now that some of my children were obvious extroverts, and why I had such a hard time understanding their constant need for activity.<br /><br />A truly fascinating book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|loved it so much the game was awesome I personnaly love horses and I love this app&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this game is so awesome everyone should get it
B00006RAKP|3.0|So many great Elton John songs but this CD has lots that weren't so good.  I should have checked it out more before purchasing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing...I cant even put it in to words...there is no way that you cannot get this game only bad thing...need Internet connection to play.
B004BDJS9Q|4.0|I needed a mindless, fun, and youthful romantic comedy and this movie did the trick. It pushed the envelop of being silly but still managed to deliver solid entertainment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love how you are drawn to each chacter and how compassionate they cn be. I am sadden to know Mary will lose her love next season.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show is so high energy and engaging!  I don't usually watch shows of this type, but the actors in this one are so great, and the dialog is so good, that I am happily hooked.  I can't wait to see what trouble Mike gets into next, or what outrageous stunt Harvey has to pull in order to save the day.  Even the theme music has me tapping my toes!  Here is a great package that I hope goes on for many seasons.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I love it! Such an awesome movie! Can't wait for Part 2. Well worth the price to be able to watch it any time we want.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is one of those shows to which I always look forward.  It is a rare combination of mystery, action, humor, and romance.  This show has it all, and Rick Castle does steal the show, without fail.  I am always laughing and absolutely glued to this one.  I hope it runs for many seasons.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was one of those books that you couldn't put down which is what i did.  Finished reading it in one day.  Very good but disturbing
B009DQQE16|5.0|One of her best albums.  And the title song is just a gem.  Elegance, haunting, showing a silver-haired woman can show grace and prowess
B008Q0AJA2|4.0|An awesome movie. Great premise, with good and understated comedic acting by Carrey and another excellent performance by Ed Harris as Cristof. If you've ever wondered about the absurdity of \\"unscripted drama\\", watch this to see how far it could go.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I read this book three times and every time I read it I came away with another facet of Steve Jobs making me realizes what a great CEO he really was.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is great to have on hand when you need it.  I love the large size -- both easy to use and easy to see!
0062238868|5.0|Day is done, gone the sun<br />From the lakes, from the hills, from the sky<br />All is well, safely rest<br />God is nigh.<br />Fading light dims the sight<br />And a star gems the sky, gleaming bright<br />From afar, drawing near<br />Falls the night.<br />Thanks and praise for our days<br />Neath the sun, neath the stars, neath the sky<br />As we go, this we know<br />God is nigh.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game starts out great, but them my son reaches a screen where he is supposed to tilt to collect coins.  The tilt feature isn't working and we can't get past that point in the game.  Any suggestions?
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I've been seeing Jeremy Renner in a number of films lately. This one is excellent. If you're a fan of the Bourne films, this one will not disappoint you. Its action packed and the plot is surprising.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait until tomorrow for the next week. Loved it. I now have told my friends that have kindles and they are watching. I would probably watch it again.
B009LHJYA0|4.0|Typical Ill Nino. Spanish Metal rock. There are a few songs on this album that really rock. There are a few songs on this album that suck. If you like this band its for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome it is fun to play and it relaxed me when I am stressful.<br />Continue making me the happiest girl in the world.<br />Thanks so much
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I was surprised that this film didn't get any Academy Award nominations. I thought there were supporting roles that were excellent in this film. The story rocks and the action is intense. Its worth the price.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|THIS ALBULM HAS LITERALLY CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE ON MUSIC...YESTERDAY (FEB 1ST) I SAW THEM AT TERMINAL 5 IN NYC AND THIS ALBUM SOUNDS EXACTLY THE SAME LIVE...THIS IS THEIR VOICE NO AUTO-TUNE<br /><br />BUY THIS ALBUM ASAP CLASSY GIRLS, FLAPPER GIRL, HO-HEY, DEAD SEA<br /><br />ONCE YOU HEAR THE SONGS ON HERE....YOU WILL LISTEN AGAIN...AND ONCE MORE....THEN 75 TIMES A DAY<br /><br />I WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THEM THAN TAYLOR SWIFT, OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY-INDIE BAND/SINGER<br /><br />THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT NYEL DOESNT GET A SOLO SONG....SHE HAS THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL SENT FROM GOD HIMSELF
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I love it  it reads all the material I use and then I could use it and read it or send it out
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've always enjoyed Clancy's books. This one is just another great thriller.  I've collected them all in hard cover and audio for the road.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|its just hilarious funny with out a moments of stop man its is funny indeed<br />I will recommend to my friends
1451695195|5.0|The author did a great job of proving that there is an afterlife. He has a story that is hard to dispute.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins is an excellent author. I love the rational behind each of his points in his writing. This can be a great book for any company to utilize as a guide for management, or really anyone for that matter! Came in great condition!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Completely love the Harry Potter Collection!<br />It so nice to have all the movies in the case whenever you want them!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I chose this rating because I loved this story!  It was captivating, sucked you into the storyline and kept you there.  Just disappointed that I cannot get Season 3 yet.  Can't stand having to wait as I may forget and lose interest.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  It's the kind of story that sticks with you. A sad slice of history.  Highly recommend.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Gorgeous cast compensates for almost all of this movies' flaws, which come mostly in the form of cliches, overdoing some of the messages and overly quick resolutions of major plotlines.  A feel-good movie in the right ways.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I have tried a lot of bluetooth headsets.  This one is the best yet.  Better than my Motorola Elite, which everyone said made my voice sound like I was talking through a very long tin can.  The charge case is a great feature, protects the headset while charging it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game sooooooo much I cant stop playing it. its very addictive.  you should. play or buy this game.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love the flipping news thing by just flicking your fingers and actually picking what news and websites to have on your flip board . Now if only they released a tablet version for my xoom
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Really liked the movie. You could tell the influence of Ridly Scott and the Alien movies. Would very much like to see a sequel.
B00003CXB4|2.0|The cover was torn and ratty. The discs looked fine but the appearance.... I bought this dvd for my children for Christmas, and it looks like I got it from a used bin at Goodwill.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Me Before You is an unbelievably moving story. Here it is days later and I still can not get this book out of my head... You can not help but fall in love with Will and Louisa.. I laughed, cried and sobbed ..Really, what more can you ask for in a book?!!??? Me Before You had it all, and I would love to see this made into a movie.. Hauntingly Beautiful and Heart wrenching.. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B00AUA67GQ|2.0|It was implied that script could be entered but found out that you need to buy the premium version to have the capability.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I just finished watching the third season which I have been looking forward to since the end of the last season and all I can say is what is wrong with them? If you haven't watched it yet, honestly I say don't. Leave it with a happy ending at season 2. I am frustrated and disappointed in the way they've chosen to go this season. Save yourself the distress.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game! Its very entertaining I really like it! Right now, there is a world tour right now! You get to go places throughout the game! I give is ★★★★★
B00A757EFW|3.0|Its okay I guess. Its really hard to control and really easy to lose. Its very challenging. And not challenging in a fun way. But it is kind of fun when your really bored and have NOTHING to do.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Not very helpful unless all you like to do is add, subtract, divide and multiply.  Prefer the calculator that comes with Windows.  Guess you cannot expect much for free.  Expected more from Kindle though.
B002MUAJ2A|2.0|The book touches a lot of valid points, and it does say things that are interesting, but it reads more like a power point presentation than like a book. It emphasizes a point, but fails to show instance when the point would be important, or examples of how the authors applied that on their work. They did say short is better but only to an extent. I would recommend it if you are in a hurry.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|lots of fun! my kids love playing it!! easy to use works well with my kindle fire and its free!!
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|This might be the original U.K. version but it is not the \\"uncut\\" version shown in the United States.  The DVDs do not include some scenes that were shown on air by PBS, including Daisy's first visit with Mr. Mason and the downstairs talk about baby formula.  Each of the three discs is bookended by that annoying Ralph Lauren commercial.  It pops up when you push \\"play\\" for the first episode and ends the last episode on each disc so it is almost impossible to avoid, but you can fast forward or skip over it.  Let me say that outright commercials embedded in a DVD set I bought and paid for is pretty unforgivable - especially in a set put together by an ostensibly commercial-free station.  The final Highlands episode is included.  This set is okay to scratch the Downton Abbey itch, but purists might want to wait for a deluxe version that comes from the producers.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Great, this app gives me all the space I need to store my photos.  I never have to worry about loosing my pictures now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me from the beginning! I could not stop reading! I love the main character, very admirable, and I'm going to start the next book right away.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is pretty fun and realistic. The graphics are amazing! You get to care for your horse and compete in competitions just like with a real horse!
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Not sure what to say, its a dvd.  It plays a movie and the movie is the one advertised on the packaging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. It beats temple run in many ways. Also it is very fast paced. Which makes it even more fun. Getting the 30th multiplier or getting 1,000,000 points is really fun.
0307386171|5.0|I am a great fan of McEwan. He always transports me emotionally into another time and space. His writing is so beautiful and am waiting to read his newest one Sweettooth.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  Adult viewing only due to faul language.  But overall, great comedy and not a total chick flick film!  A must see!!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I love this case!  The only drawback is that it doesn't have a place to hold the stylus.  I put it in the case so that the recharging slots are on the outer edge when the case is closed.  A couple of apps come through upside down and won't rotate.  I suspect that this is a problem with the apps and not with the kindle. Overall, I like the way you can adjust the angle to any position when using the stand and the way the kindle turns off/on automatically when you close/open the case.  Much easier than using the tiny power switch on the kindle!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I hear a music reviewer discussing this album on PBS one afternoon while driving. She played one cut and I was hooked. It's a really remarkable debut. I'm so glad I happened on it.
B007U4DB4G|5.0|Great movie. It is very funny. It was better than I expected. I think it is the best one yet. The little girl that I actually purchased it for really loved it.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I am Mr. Townshend's contemporary but never really paid any attention to The Who.  The band was way outside what I was interested in at the time, so I came to the autobiography with few preconceived notions. I heard him interviewed on a PBS program one day and decided to read the book because he seemed so very interesting.  I loved the book and was amazed at his life and accomplishments.  Very, very unusual artist across many genres with a wonderful talent for expressing himself.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is really fun I play it with my little sister. I think it should be easier to get purple diamonds.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series! Once I got started, I just couldn't stop watching the episodes! I can't wait for the next season...
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I would enjoy this cover more if it had a hand strap on the inside cover. I find it difficult to hold while reading. Otherwise it works as intended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app is awesome, cool, a killer, fantastic, fabulous, good for kid that love play game and apps
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game you will be playing it for hours on end. made great changes from the first temple. run :)
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This story was very suspenseful and believable. The characters were developed well and I really enjoyed the ending.  The technical parts were a little too deep for me, but it was very well done.
B006ZNRD06|2.0|Some of the supported file types are not playing back properly or at all.  I have to quit and go use another video player to see the .avi's, .3gp's and .flv's.  I'll try the unlocker app to see if I get better performance, but I don't see why video files that work on PC and Mac are so hard to get to work on Android.
0345803493|4.0|Good price and good book to read if you're interested in S&M or want to explore different things.<br /><br />Thanks LOL
B007BFSYMS|5.0|With the addition of adding sounds into the app it makes it less likely for me to get bored with the preloaded sounds.  I also like that the import feature notices when you have downloaded a sound from the apps webpage and asks if you want to import now or later.
B00138CYD4|5.0|How can you not love these songs? Santana is great and I love listening to this album over and over again.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I tried to run media off of a network share and at first all I could do was see catagories of media types but I couldn't find the files I wanted from those lists.  I had to click around to find a &#34;folder&#34; view that showed what was in a folder and not every thing at once like the lists do.
B000002O4X|5.0|Wonderful music for one of the most beloved movies of all times. Relaxing and enjoyable. Recommend this CD for anyone's collection.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very good read even if you're not a teen or young adult.  The details and storyline are great, but not enough to want to stop reading, keeps you on your feet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is a grate game for all ages it it fun the way you get different items as you surf the trains!!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Weird,dark....and bizzarely wonderful.  TV will never be the same.  This is not for the faint of heart,but it is a really satisfying thrill ride!
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Good story but very hard to follow with too many characters involved in too many side stories inside a main story.
0811870987|5.0|This book is amazing.<br />I love every single page of it. It's a great book for to have on a coffee table.<br />Very artistic, very neat and unique.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game!!!!!!!!!! grafivs very good on the kindle fire<br />very easy and addictive game to play<br />when is the update 0.6.1 coming out though?
B008B92U32|2.0|I thought this would be fun to have, but I was wrong.<br />It does not work well on my Nexus 7.<br />The controls are easy but this is more of a child’s app IMO.<br />Very cheesy looking cut and paste app for photos.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun. Too many things need the investment papers though. It's nice that it continues to collect money when your not playing unlike other games....
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Good case, nice layout. The case itself is a little small so it kind of feels like I'm wearing a child's backpack. That being said, it fits everything well... including my knitting. Very easy to set up.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|It was okay. No big deal.....not really well connected. The DVD arrived on time and in good shape. That's it.
0385344228|5.0|The best court room drama I have read in years. Excellent prose. Difficult to put down. All the good things a reader wants in a page turner. Enough to make me order his two other books.
0988262592|5.0|If you've ever heard the words \\"we can't wait for IT\\" or \\"IT is always in the way\\" chances are the first hundred pages of \\"The Phoenix Project\\" are going to be hard to read. I found myself having flashbacks from previous jobs. Just a few chapters in and you'll not only have identified the Sarah's, Brent's, and John's in your life but you'll see yourself in one or more of the characters. I'd like to think I'm more like Bill but have been Brent and Wes more often then I'd like to admit.<br /><br />This relatability is one of the strengths of the book. Quickly identifying the cast, backstory and filling in the gaps puts you in the center of the company. The problems feel real and halfway through you'll feel invested in finding their solutions. Plus its always nice to have a villian to root against.<br /><br />If you aren't already students of Deming, Goldratt, and Taiichi Ohno \\"The Phoenix Project\\" is a wonderful way to be introduced. Coming from a software engineering background I found the change of viewpoint refreshing. IT Operations is changing and I hope this book shows the path we choose to take.
B009O07NDY|3.0|I thought that this would be the whole score in its entirety like when the whole scores of the Lord of the Rings released about three years latter after the trilogy had its run ended in the winter of 2004.But it wasn't.For the first tracks it does have the main sequences, but then as you go further into the music it then is edited and shortend then what it was on screen.So I hope that this was not about money that they could not put the whole thing in one package.I hope that when the whole prequal trilogy is over that Reprise Records gives the authorization to have Howard Shores Hobbit scores re-relaesed in its entirety the way it should be.
0308102282|5.0|This book was first given me in 1980, so I guess you could say that, these days, it is vintage self-help.  Yet, I find it is still very helpful for those men and women who reach a point of self-realization in their adult lives that they need to fix things within.  I guess life is such a thing for us humans that, to reach the age of 40, you have already hurt yourself, and a few others, just to learn what life really is.  There is no other way.<br />Also, the man who gave me this book was one of the wisest men I have ever met, so, consider the source.  He knew I needed it.<br />Friends are Spiritual Family, so, in order to deal with them, you have to clean up relationships in your mind and heart, and in your own family as well.  Besides, as you grow older, you begin to realize that you are much less friend-oriented, and  many that you keep, you do so because you know them, but love them anyway.<br /><br />And, even if you are, pardon the word, “normal”, you certainly will have family and friends who are so neurotic that they are intensely aware of all their own pains, but oblivious to yours…time to start realizing your realizations.<br />The only other important thing is that, by age 40 or so, you can divide people into two categories:  Those who love to learn and are excited to grow, and the rest who : “learn nothing and forget nothing.”  No book, and no Master, and no Messiah can help the stubborn 2nd group.  Most all of them, even if they are brought to the door of Death, and then somehow miraculously released at the last moment to live more life—they still won’t get it.  No change:  no livin’~~!!!  No matter what therapy or what ceremony or what system you use for therapy, if you the patient don’t do the work, you won’t live smart.  You either do the work on yourself, and co-operate with those that are helping you in the process, or, you die stupid.  Take your choice.  Start with this book.  It helps.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|After a quarter through, I got very impatient with the book. I don't know where it's going and what was the purpose. When I got to the end, all I can say is that it's a Jodi Piccoult wannabe. Problem is, the book has no 'soul'. I don't understand why it got such good reviews. I read this at the urging of a good friend, and she was disappointed that I didn't like this book at all.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Loved loved the CD. but then I am a fan of the Rolling Stones music! If you like the Stones, don't hesitate to order this one! If you are not a huge fan, I think you will still enjoy it...
076115678X|5.0|This book is amazing after reading it all her tips made total since! My curly hair has never looked better. I've tired the devacurl products by Lorraine Massey the work wonders on my hair and smell great too:)
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was very entertaining.  The singing was amazing, and the acting was hilarious.  It was overall a great movie watching experience.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|For my birthday, my 17 year old daughter and 15 year old son watched this with me (Mom) and we all loved it.  Finding a movie that we all like is very unusual!
B005FITIK0|5.0|Really funny movie.  I don't know so many people didn't like it.  Maybe because it hits too close too home and a lot of people watch movies so they can forget about themselves and their own lives once in a while.  To all the people who gave this movie one star, all I have to say is, hahaha!
B00APJLX8E|5.0|This movie was great for the whole family! Even my two year old loved it! After renting it on Amazon I went right out and purchased it! Great story with lots of humor for us adults! Thanks Adam Sandler!!
B008220C38|1.0|Sorry to be less than enthusiastic about this film, but can Miss Knightly act?  The closest I've seen her come to it is her listless performance as Cecilia in \\"Atonement.\\"  As for Vronsky, well, I always thought Tolstoy meant him to be a grown (albeit young) man, not a pouting post-adolescent. Skip this miscast, theatrically tricked-up version of the classic tale and watch the superb Helen McCrory as she fully inhabits the character of Anna in the BBC Masterpiece Theatre version (2000).
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|If the future is going to be destroyed by pollution this movie shows how human caring will clean it up.
B0060D15AK|4.0|I love Sita Alaska. I know it wasn't filmed there, but I can see the orignal Sita in this movie. Betty White stole the show more than once.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|With many unexpected twists per usual, the fifth book in the series has such a slower pace with a smattering of &#34;wait... Whaaaaat?&#34; Moments. Worth reading, but you won't plow through it like the third.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I watched the original series with English subtitles. This was great and I will be buying the other two when they come out.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This version of Angry Birds is very cute and not to hard to beat! I like it much better than Angry Birds Space version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is great and exciting. I love the around the world subway surfer. All my friends have it and play the game together.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is so much better than the first one. best game ever blab blab blab blab I don't know what else to write.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I will be sending my DVD collection for Season 3 back to Amazon, and hoping for a refund!<br /><br />I had watched seasons 1 and 2 on DVD and had read that the &#34;full UK version&#34; was more complete than what was aired on PBS.  I began watching season 3 on PBS, but ordered the DVD set to be delivered upon release, anxious to watch the episodes in their entirety.  Well, not only is it not the &#34;full UK edition&#34;, it's not even the full US edition!  I compared one episode that I had recoreded from PBS to the episode on DVD, and found there to be more than 10 minutes of footage missing on the DVD!<br /><br />I don't know what the &#34;game&#34; is.  But I want my money back!
B001NLL93W|5.0|This series is great! Loved each book so far. Almost better than Twilight series.. actually may even be better! Can't wait to keep reading more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so much better than Temple Run. I enjoy greatly and the objectives gives you a little challenge. I absolutely  recommend this!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Why on earth would you create such a graphically beautiful world just so you can run around in circles over and over. Shoulda made a sandbox game instead. And what is with Karma Lee, lol.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game far surpassed temple run one. I love this game u will too.all my friends play this. great game
B006P96PAO|4.0|I really loved this movie it is an inspiration to a starving world that lacks compassion and empathy...Good story line.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|It's Great movie, I think it's a must see movie. I've passed over this movie at my local store, but not any more. It's on the way to my home. So that my husband and I can see when ever we want.  My husband has replayed the movie 5+ times. It's that good!!!!!!!!!! :-)

B004S5C91Q|2.0|the 5 yearold is telling the story hwhich I didn't enjoy like I thought I would. Found this hard to follow, and got boring quite quickly!!
1840225564|2.0|The women are silly and it seems that money is the main focus along with the men and especially the women marrying well. That means to someone with wealth. How these stories became movie material I don't know!
1451696191|5.0|This is one of those books you are going to have to read twice. It's very interesting the way the story comes together.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|All though I finished the game in a few days, I enjoyed it!<br />Looking forward to the next one.  No issue at all!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a very engaging story. Mature subject matter and language, so not for the younger reader. Still, it's a very good read.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved the book it had great plot and always kept me reading I loved this book!!!!!!<br /><br />Also it needed the a little more detail just a little
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Well restored.  Some have claimed clarity issues at the edges, however, I did not see it.  I can never see it in 70mm as I did in 1964 at the Palace in Chicago, but this will do.  My wife and could have danced all night!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game this game is almost the only game i play my high score is 290877 and i love it i wonder how people cant play ot at least twice a day i play this game nonstop but the only issue is....how expensive the boards and limised adition people are
B008NW67E0|4.0|I thought this CD was pretty good and they just keep making good music! Mumford & Sons are awesome at what they do!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really good game.I don't think there is not a better game in the app store or in the world
B008G33NFC|5.0|I M a big TARA fan since her Nightwish days .The footage inside the theater is great. The soundmix is very powerful. If you have a subwoofer ,you ll feel your spine shake from the bass drums.  This is a great show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I believe this game is the best game ever since temple run. Or angry birds space. So if you love this app say this was it was useful because it is after I tell you  this info. I just got the game a couple of months ago. And I love it. I know  once you play this you will like the game. If you like temple run because it is the just same thing but better. Seriously though get it and the best thing about it is that it is FREE!!!!!!!!!!!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|I just started to listen to this band. I really enjoyed the performance. This is a powerful band. I liked the guest singers.  Simome Simons is my favorite, I love her voice and her long red hair.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|If you are a fan of Sam and Dean you will love this season.  It has some very good episodes in it.
B000BSNPRG|5.0|this is a great band. I wished I still worked in radio doing promotions, I would love to promote them.  The concert footage is awesome. The surround sound mix is great too. I love these guys music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game Is  awesome. It is so much fun.  I get on it every time I open up my kindle. I love the powers, prizes, and daily challenges.  All I have to say is purchase this game!!!!;)
B001CTUI8M|5.0|These guys are awesome,I wished more people knew about them in the u.s.  Watching this was just like being on the stage with them. I would love to sit in with the band sometime. This performance is truly inspiring. ENJOY !!!!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I think Timothy Ferriss has an amazing non-linear brain that is constantly in search of the most effective ways of doing things, what he calls MED, or minimum effective dose. The end result is that he brings together a bunch of dissimilar ideas that seem to have no connection. Reading his book is like having a conversation with a wildly distractible, yet brilliant person; you never know where the conversation is going nor what amazing idea will pop up next, or how they'll all be connected.<br /><br />As usual with Timothy's books, I came away with quite a few surprisingly useful ideas, strategies, and life hacks. One example, in the middle of a book that's supposed to be about cooking, but is really about learning, I discovered his simple method to lose weight... and I'm already down 13 pounds over four weeks just from following his single, simple suggestion that's tossed in as a &#34;oh by the way...&#34;<br /><br />Ya, it's not your typical book by your typical author. I'm a fan.
0060775858|5.0|I read this book to all four of my children and now that they are having children of their own, of course I will make sure it is in their libraries!  The cadence of the rhyme and simplicity of the illustrations captivates children and provides a perfect transition to bedtime.
030758836X|4.0|What happens when the boy/girl next door wakes up to realize he/she is married to a psychopath? That is the basic premise of this hard-to-put-down mystery novel. The twist is that for a great part of this book we don't know which one is the psychopath and which is the b/g next door. This feat is accomplished by the device of the double narrator; Nick Dunne (hubby) and Amy Elliott Dunne (wife) alternate telling their stories, Nick as a straight first-person narrative, Amy in the form of a diary. Can either be trusted? Which one?<br /><br />The device is very clever, and Gillian Flynn is a deft writer with a sound ear, but not genius. I wish that Flynn had taken her plot to the next level. Mid way through the book an important source of the ambiguity (the degree to which the diary can be trusted) is resolved, and for me the book started to feel more pedestrian after this point. I think that the ambiguity could have been maintained longer, perhaps for the whole novel, by extending rather than tidying up the questions raised by the narrative form. (For example, I thought at one point the diary might be a concoction of Nick's. That would have been cool!) And I was fascinated by the fact that Nick has a female twin (with the provocative name, especially given the title of this book, of \\"Go\\"). But the plot takes a predictable turn, nothing is really done with its tantalizing complexities, and the characters sort themselves out into familiar patterns. Readers who like clear resolution will be pleased.<br /><br />This book indeed is satisfying in so many ways, which is why it was such a bestseller (today, seven months after its release it is still #7 on amazon's top-selling books). I liked it enough to put one of Flynn's other novel's on my Kindle. I didn't buy a hard copy though.
0345803485|2.0|Purchased this after having heard SO much about it.  Haven't made it past the first few chapters after 3 weeks because it is so predictable and sappy.  I didn't realize it was a &#34;romance novel.&#34;  Have now decided to skim through the &#34;junior high&#34; mentality and reach whatever all the talk was about; however, doubt that my opinion will change much.  Maybe it will inspire me to write my own &#34;sexy&#34; novel at an ADULT level, because this one is so not it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Because I just can't stop thinking about it.  Green outdoes even himself here, making myself, a 30-something, question what kind of person I am and the deeper questions of life and my place in this world.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the characters, the wit, the development of the people, technology and the roles they play regarding historical events etc. costumes are superb and scenery is great. Overall, very entertaining.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This seems too simple to be fun, but it turns out to be more complex than at first glance. A few games and I was quickly hooked! Easy to play on phone or tablet. Still happy on the free games, so I don't know if the pay games are better or not.
B006N57PXG|5.0|Bartimaus is one of the most sarcastic characters ever. As you read the story, you think &#34;I should dislike him, but I find I always want him to win&#34;. Intelligently written, full of dark humor and wit. One of my all time favorite books.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Frankenweenie was a fun movie to watch; however, It did have a pretty predictable story arch and many of its characters relied too heavily on racial and gender stereotypes. Despite that, the lovable Sparky more often than not made up for its short comings. I would not recommend that little kids see it because there are a few scary scenes that might keep them up at night. Not Burton's best, but enjoyable.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I have not laughed this much in a long time. The dope smokiing sessions were so realistic. I have no idea what would be left in a &#34;rated&#34; version.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game is great, I love it.  It is extremely difficult though.  Lots of levels, some can take an hour to finish.  If you like puzzle games, get this one. There is a free one too which is just as good, but not as long (and a little easier).  It's called trainyard express.  I recommend both.  Try the free one first if you are not sure.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Waste of time. The story was so unforgettable and what happen to showing the action instead of telling. It was like a book on tape.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you like the first one, you'll like this one too. It is the best running game I've played.  It is slightly better than the first, and blows the others out of the water.
0385341008|5.0|Hard to put the book down.  Took a bit to get into the letters and figure out who was who.  But I could have continued reading had the story gone on.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have been using this for about 1.5 yrs.  Very happy with this app.  The choices that you are given to create your own layout is nice.<br />Recently, emailed a question for help.  Had my answer and concern resolved within 24hrs.  Well worth the price!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is addicting. We had gotten a Roku for my dad for Christmas. But my sister and I sort of monopolized it (oops) while we were at home together for the holidays and had watched the first season via Netflix. When they didn't have season 2, we freaked out and immediately queued it up on Amazon. I don't have Prime so I just paid for it. So worth it!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I saw Dr. Alexander on the Katie TV show and bought this book on kindle to read his story.  I appreciated what he had to say
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The movie was poorly done, and the plot was dismal.<br />It is typical of a British movie.<br />Would you like to buy it back...still unopened?
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My picky 2 year old loved it right away! I even love it. Beautiful and soothing. Some might think it is a bit strange but we are huge fans.
030759565X|5.0|I spent an entire weekend reading this book. It's entertaining, funny, and filled with great recipes. Most cooks and bakers will have the ingredients in their fridge or pantry. I love this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this.  Gideon and Eva continue their struggle to love and trust each other with their pasts still haunting them.  I can't wait until book 3 comes out in May!
B000002JSJ|5.0|Thank you for the CD I wanted.  I have all the Zeppelin albums on CD now.  Cool Huh?  I think so, the best Rock N ' Roll band ever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Better than the first two seasons, if that is possible! Can't wait for Season 4!  Please don't let it end like this!
0782008372|5.0|My wife, of all people, wanted to watch (revisit) the Highlander Series in total. So, we bought all the movies (except the animated one) and the entire TV series. She has begun watching them and will be at it awhile. While watching over shoulder, I was reawakened to how cool these movies are. A good purchase. Recommended.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My minecraft won't open and i have no idea why. Can someone smart tell me how to fix it? Please please please please!!!
B0051OZ564|5.0|This is one of the coolest films I have ever watched. It has it all - babes, great graphics, an interesting story line and a dose of &#34;life isn't always fair.&#34; A super film.
