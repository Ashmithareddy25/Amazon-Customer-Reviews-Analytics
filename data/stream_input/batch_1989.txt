I read the whole book though because I did find the flowers and their meanings were an interesting component to the book as a whole.  I was just disappointed with the storyline in general.

B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is a must have for any fan of the comic, or fan of all out action movies.  There is a reason why this film shot to number one in DVD/Blu Ray sales within it's first week, it is an all out kill fest, packed with more action than Hollywood has seen in the last few years.  Dredd source material alone is a fantastic read, add to this move a fantastic writer and director, and you have an immediate hit.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|I had heard about this movie so many times I decided to buy it.  It's fun and silly in parts, and serious and creepy in others.  I can see why so many movies were inspired by it.  In a way you could call Jurassic Park the Westworld Sequel.  It's well worth watching.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|As a previous reviewer has said, I found myself using the hint button more often than I would have liked. Often it is hard to tell where you should be going next. The hidden object puzzles seem to be randomly dispersed throughout the area and it's up to you to find them in the large town. The graphics and story were very good though. It kept me entertained long enough to deem it worth my time and money.

B000JMKNV0|5.0|I read Lehane's Mystic River a while back and loved it. I think Shutter Island was even better. Lehane writes emotion and characters better then most other authors. Teddy Daniels, the main character in Shutter Island, is such a realistic and understandable character. He is fundamentally flawed but Lehane's superior story telling and characterization allows the reader to feel, relate and justify his flaws in a way that really puts you into the story and setting. The actual story has a great setting and follows a very interesting and twist filled path. It isn't impossible to figure out the big twist at the end of the novel but I feel that Lehane wrote the book with the intention of having you start to suspect what was really going on about halfway through. It really has the feeling of inevitability but you are so ensconced by the story and characters that you truly want to know for sure exactly what has happened. The book also ends in a satisfactory way, not dragging on but giving you solid closure at the same time. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great suspenseful thriller with relatable and flawed characters.

0345531965|5.0|From the reviews there are a lot of Grisham detractors out there that like to read his books and complain.  I found this to be up to Grisham standards, an engrossing story that kept me interested throughout.  The pace is typical Grisham - steady, short chapters that move the story right along. Smooth prose.  Unlike some reviewers, I got a good feel for the characters.  The ending was very nicley done: simple, efficient, and satisfying - you put the book down and say, \\"that ending was worth the time put into the read.\\"  For me, this is simply all that I can ask of a book and I am so often disappointed.  The story is not perfect, and this is not, \\"A Time to Kill,\\" but it is very good, readable, and recommendable

1451608659|5.0|Great Book!<br /><br />A must read for all Dominique and Gymnastics fans. Dominique courageously takes us on a journey throughout her gymnastics career. Especially during her &#34;pixie&#34; years. A must read to the ones that seek for the true story behind the immaculate image of a happy young gymnast and her shining smile and personality. Behind the scenes, Dominique was painfully alone and suffering through unbearable pain for a girl of such a young age. This book really will amaze you, with her family secrets and her journey to a happy womanhood crossing a dark and dangerous path.<br /><br />This book goes beyond the gymnastics, it's a life-endurance story about a frightened, yet beautiful young girl that had to fight towards her maturity against everything. Highly recommended. Do what Dominique always did and go for it!
B008YEA3PQ|5.0|&#34;The Name Of The Wind&#34; and the next book in the series titled &#34;The Wise Man's Fear&#34; are my top 2 favorite books. I recommend these titles to everyone I speak to.

B004Q3QRWC|5.0|This book had so many wonderful reviews, I couldn't resist. And I was not disappointed!<br /><br />First of all, the writing is innovative, intelligent and flows like water. [I am a sucker for good writing- no, even more, I insist on it, or I won't continue with the story]. The book is comprised of several chapters each one based on a character from the over-arching story, creating this marvelous sense of connectedness. The characters are quirky and more than a little messed up - all in different ways. There was not one person in the book that I did not relate to, even though I am not anything like them on the surface.<br /><br />The story spans across 3ish decades so there is something for everyone.<br /><br />My only regret is buying the Kindle edition because I missed out on the slide show. Otherwise I was completely engaged with each person, and didn't really want their part of the story to end. [some return- namely Bennie and Sasha]<br /><br />If you want a good read that tickles your brain- THIS IS IT!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Ok, so Rachel Weisz goes from nerdy, lab-coat patsy to ninja killer in fewer than a dozen frames; if you are a thriller lover, this should not be an insurmountable barrier to your enjoyment of what amounts to an emotional carnival ride. Jeremy Renner is a worthy heir to Matt Damon's character and the writers manage a delightful cast of nefarious uber-intelligence types that are, by turns, ruthless and befuddled by our hero's resourcefulness and resilience. Edward Norton is specially believable as the dark &#34;Mr. Fixit&#34; and you really find yourself not minding the more outlandish action scenes ... yeah, I mean the wolf scene! Rent it, or buy it ... it's a lot of bang for the buck.

B007SGM084|3.0|Ok book, a little over the top for me personally although a lot of people loved it.<br />I thought there was a lot of repeat over and over which to me were boring.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Meryl Streep was exquisite as an actress as usual, and the cinematography was quite enthralling. Sadly, that is all I can say positively about this movie.<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a woman who fought through male chauvinism to become Britain's first woman Prime Minister and its longest serving one at that. She lived through World War II, survived an IRA bombing, kept Western Europe together during the Cold War, and grew UK's GDP by 23 percent (annualized) for ten years.<br /><br />So, against this backdrop, the movie spent well over 75% of its time focusing on Lady Thatcher's mental decline??? Her achievements, her mastery (though sometimes clumsy) of British politics, her razor sharp wit and intellect were nothing more than thin bookends of her dementia in the movie.<br /><br />Folks! When people get old, they develop ailments; some worse than others, but that is natural and normal... nothing to really write home about - what is worth raving about is her character: her strength, vision, values, tenacity, wit, intellect and quiet sense of pride. Yes, she is a flawed person who was a flawed Prime Minister but no more than any other.<br /><br />So, I find this movie, well-made as it is, repulsive and deeply-insulting for de-emphasizing her achievements and over-emphasizing her mental decline. If not insulting to Lady Thatcher, it is to those of us who were alive during the 1980's and saw a world in turmoil (like we are once again now), and the Iron Lady was instrumental in the survival of Great Britain and most of Europe. We would be lucky to have another Margaret Thatcher as leader of the UK or here in the US.

I am looking for a replacement for Rhapsody where I can purchase my music and store in the Cloud and pay from anywhere.  This app appears to fulfill those requirement; but the lack of simple instructions on how to use it is the reason for the low rating.

1577314808|5.0|A life saver of a book, a &#34;sanity saver&#34; if you will.  Tolle has been criticized for Americanizing Buddhist teachings and techniques, but what's wrong with that?  He makes it palatable and understandable.  If you follow his idea of always staying in the moment as much as possible, you'd be amazed at how much stress it lifts off your shoulders..  The idea is that (to paraphrase), &#34;the only moment you have to worry about is this moment right here, right now.&#34;  You don't have to worry about what your sister did to you at  the prom 30 years ago, or what your mother said to you at your wedding or what the insurance salesman told you last year about your premiums - you only have to deal with these things when they happen and after they happen - LET IT GO.  If you really practice doing this, your life will really change and it's easier than you think.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Very clearly put together. Practical and helpful except that the screen shots and specific instructions regarding Word are for current iterations of that software.

B0050R0XEG|5.0|The Lego Volkswagen Camper captures the look and spirit of the original van.<br /><br />The finished product is outstanding. Lego did an amazing job with moving parts and surprising little details. The cloth pop up camper roof is incredible the way it works.<br /><br />This was a roughly two day build. Difficult, but not the most difficult I've built. The large Space Shuttle was a bit more difficult ([[ASIN:B003M0PABE Lego Creator Shuttle Adventure (10213)]]). The Ferrari Formula 1 kit is way more difficult ([[ASIN:B0001A86AA LEGO Racers: Ferrari F1 Racer 1:10 Scale]]). This is for the experienced Lego Maniac. Probably not a great choice for a first over 1,000 piece kit - there are a lot of little pieces and some tricky assemblies. 16 years old for the lower age range is maybe a little bit high; thirteen or fourteen would probably be fine if they've built a lot of kits. The parts bags are not numbered - frankly none of these large number of piece kits are numbered. This builds just like all the old school kits I've done over the years. I always work out of the bags, and the tendency is for parts to be grouped in a few bags. There is a rhythm to which bags to use. Finding the parts is almost half the fun.<br /><br />There were no missing parts and the fit and finish is perfection. My boys and I have built several hundred kits, I have only found one missing part (a car wash brush on Flo's Diner from the recent Cars series).<br /><br />I'm surprised the finished model is so durable. This is pretty darn big, about the size of a 1/12 scale car model. This is one of their series of scale models. It looks great on display.

B003H9MSPG|1.0|This blaster is long and in an actual gun that generally translates to good range and excellent accuracy.  However this blaster, while quite accurate gets only average range at best.  Besides that it is slow to prime and fire.  It's length also means it is very cumbersome, especially indoors.<br /><br />All of this is very disappointing considering it is meant to look like a rifle.  It is one of the best looking blasters Nerf has ever made.  It is the most disappointing blaster Nerf has ever made.<br /><br />As of the summer of 2012 Nerf has begun releasing a new line of blasters called the Nerf Elite.  These blasters so completely out class the old ones they are no longer worth buying new.  The new blasters all shoot seventy-five feet, this one only gets twenty-five or thirty.<br /><br />Consider buying these instead: Nerf Elite Rayven CS-18, Rampage, Stryfe or Strongarm.  [[ASIN:B009T45XVE Nerf N-Strike Elite: Rayven CS-18 Blaster]], [[ASIN:B0083TXX9U Nerf N-Strike Elite Rampage Blaster]], [[ASIN:B009T45XNM Nerf N-Strike Elite: Stryfe Blaster]], [[ASIN:B009T45XDW Nerf N-Strike Elite: Strongarm Blaster]].  They are distinguishable by their dark blue paint scheme with a prominent white stripe.<br /><br />I have personally used this blaster as well as many, many others.  I run Nerf games, and have done many hours of research.

B009NRO5XE|4.0|I've just listen to Bryan Ferry's latest endeavor.  I must say that I'm pleasantly pleased.  It's apparent to most Ferry/Roxy Music fans that this was bound to happen.  Hell, I might have even suggested it to Ferry via his website.  I thought it was rather ingenious to give the recording a distinct 1920's production style or technique.  This really does enhance the sound believe or not.  As most fans know; Ferry has a penchant for this kind of material and he delivers a solid interpretation of his solo and Roxy work with assistance of the amazing COLIN GOOD.<br /><br />Ferry doesn't play or sing on this album but oversees the production.  The song selection is pure genius:  first off is DO THE STRAND...I loved it .... perfect fit to the Charleston and one can easily envision a flapper going wild during this song.<br /><br />Next is LOVE IS THE DRUG:  unusual arrangement but once again, I envision a speakeasy filled with happy couples hopping around to this one.<br /><br />The trifecta of DON'T STOP THE DANCE, AVALON and JUST LIKE YOU are purely a lover's chance to romance his or her partner. I think these three are my favorites on this album.<br /><br />An homage of sorts to the GREAT GATSBY...is the ROXY MUSIC classic THE BOGUS MAN... (from the album FOR YOUR PLEASURE---check out my review of that album as well)the title not the lyrical content... I always thought of it as nod to JACK THE RIPPER but for this production Gatsby will do ...F.SCOTT FITZGERALD--Ferry must have read some of his work to get a better understanding of America during the JAZZ AGE.<br /><br />THE ONLY FACE originally found on Bryan's 1994 album MAMOUNA is a favorite of mine as well and doesn't loose anything in this version...however I still adore the 1994 version immensely.<br /><br />THIS IS TOMORROW(the opening track from Ferry's 1977 solo album IN YOUR MIND) is an odd choice and at first I couldn't recognise it but enjoyable nontheless.<br /><br />I THOUGHT was a track from 2002's FRANTIC and was written by FERRY and BRIAN ENO and was the best track off that album ...here it's given the sound that would have played well at a southern ball or New Year's party or maybe during the CRASH OF '29 since most thought their fortunes couldn't get any bigger.  I can envision COLE PORTER coming up with this title.<br /><br />THIS ISLAND EARTH is probably the best track on this album and in my top 10 of FERRY originals(taken from the 1978 album THE BRIDE STRIPPED BARE) and is the longest clocking in at 4:26 most of the tracks are under 3:00 so it is keeping with songs of the time.<br /><br />It is different but not unexpected. Ferry has concocted a bubbling brew that at first is an acquired taste but then goes down smooth as his previous efforts. I think JAZZ afficianados will appreciate his attempt to re-create a by-gone era. I really enjoyed this trip to sulky hideaways, supper clubs, private jazz parties and hints of DUKE ELLINGTON, COLE PORTER and GERSHWIN maybe you will too.and was written by FERRY and BRIAN ENO and was the best track off that album ...here it's given the sound that would have played well at a southern ball or New Year's party or maybe during the CRASH OF '29 since most thought their fortunes couldn't get any bigger.

030758836X|4.0|What was that movie called, with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito was in it somehow, where they were a couple geting a divorce and there was nothing too low for either of them to wish on the other?  The War of the Roses, wasn't it?  The movie played on the good feelings, the chemistry, the stars had exhibited in earlier teamings (like \\"Romancing the Stone\\") and then bludgeoned everything nice the audience felt for either by a sick, twisted heaping helping of absurd malice and overkill.  Well perhaps you know where I'm going with this, but if you saw The war of the Roses, there's really no need to read Gone Girl.  I will say that GG is wonderfully written, and Gillian Flynn hasn't lost her knack for Gothis suspense built up on lonely settings populated by demented people with a thrill for blood.<br /><br />I was ready to hate Nick from the moment I heard him call his sister, Margo, \\"Go.\\"  Pardon me, I beg you, if any readers are called \\"Go,\\" but, in a book overteeming with conicidence and farfetchedness, I found the use of \\"Go\\" and a diminutive of \\"Margo\\" the hardest to swallow.  I would love to see what the original Margo (Margo Channing in All About Eve) would have made of Nick if he were her brother and he came up with one of his trademark banter-bordering-on-incest lines like, \\"Go, you're just like me if I had adick.\\"  He would be mincemeat.  It's plain above all else that Missouri really is an awful place to grow up in and an even worse one to return to.  The burghers of Missouri must have photos of Gillian Flynn posted next to every cash register reading simply, \\"Shoot on Sight.\\"<br /><br />I did think that the device of a successful series of children's books based on an Amazing Amy character is very believeable and I hope Flynn grants a deserving young writer the franchise rights to flesh out the series, continue the brand.  Flynn has seen the very worst of men and women and she is leaving no stones unturned in her effort to permanently deter a nation from Heterosexual intercourse.eter a nation from Heterosexual intercourse.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the very few TV shows which my wife and I try to never miss but we purchased this so that other family members could enjoy it too. Surely, Lady Mary is the prettiest woman ever to appear on TV.  We love each and every resident of Downton Abbey but I do fear that Bates is guilty; poor, poor Anna.
1400052181|5.0|This is an incredible story that made me laugh, made me angry and made me cry. Having worked in laboratory medicine, I think it should be read by anyone with a medical career or an interest in medical science. Ms. Skloot's research and narrative of the story of Henrietta, her cells and her family show that there are a multitude of perspectives that can be taken about what happened over the course of time since Henrietta's cells were removed from her body. Attitudes & policies changed and actions we could not accept today were commonplace in the early days. I had to keep this in mind and remember my own work and personal experiences as I read through the timeline of events and the descriptions of the actions of those who were involved. My emotions were on a roller coaster ride during the entire book. The bottom line is that this is a book I picked up and read every time I had a free minute - it grabbed me and I didn't want to let go until I had read every single page. At the end, my thoughts were that it is story about humanity. A lot of heartache was created by a single action taking probably no more than a minute or two, yet so much good has happened because of that action. I have come to think that the perhaps Henrietta Lacks was intended all along to be the source of all the good and that the good will continue for her family and the rest of the world.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Fast, great graphics, easy install, and the included CPU fan/heatsink is quite adequite and quiet. I'm not a gamer, I'm a software developer and this fits my needs very nicely.<br /><br />Maybe if you are a heavy duty gamer and like to overclock everything, there are faster CPUs and Graphics out there, but you won't find anything faster or better for the money, period.<br /><br />Windows 7 Performance Stats ( WEI ):<br />Processor:  7.3<br />Graphics:  6.8<br />Gaming Graphics: 6.8<br /><br />Benchmarks are real close to a more expensive Intel I-5 CPU with a good graphics card. Not too bad for a CPU/GPU just a little over a hundred bucks.<br /><br />Liked it so much, I upgraded (2) systems. One system is using a Biostar Mainboard and the other Gigabyte Mainboard, both with 8 Gigs of RAM.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Sent to my mother-in-law who said she enjoyed it.  DVDs made nice gifts for people who have minimal TV Service/Channels.
0765325950|5.0|This particular volume is unlike any other in the series. From page 1 there is always something awesome going on, scarcely a lull to be found. An excellent ending to an excellent series. If only it didn't have to end.
B003L77G8I|5.0|We were traveling the 6th season and for some reason missed when Booth and Bones got together so I bought these DVDs to we could catch up.  Great that TV shows are now on DVDs so if you find something you like and have missed one or two seasons, you can catch up.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Entertaining, enlightening and edifying!<br />Nothing more needs to be said - why do you need sixteen words when three suffice?
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An excellent allegory and analogy of how our current world is changing to be more inclusive and that all religions really say the same thing essentially.
0307474259|5.0|I went to the doctor 6 months ago because I just couldn't lose weight. I am not a couch potato, I am always going going and going. I watched the amounts of food I ate and tried to make healthy low fat choices, but still I was 185lbs! I really hoped my doctor could give me some magic appetite suppressor. But instead he told me about this book. I googled it and read reviews about eating low carb. I read reviews that people don't feel good,its really hard to do blah blah blah. So I went back to my doctor and said I don't have a carb problem I have a gentic problem. My mother,my aunts my grandmothers, we are all the exact same shape and size. He still insisted I read this book. I just got frustrated and said no, I'd rather be fat then give up carbs!<br />1 week ago my husband went to our doctor (we have the same one) because of an issue with gout and high blood pressure. Our doctor sat him down and explained to him that research is showing that gout is an early warning sign of diabetes. And between that,his high blood pressure and his weight he is a walking time bomb. He explained at 38 my husband is bound to have a heart attack or get diabetes in the next 10 years. And (LOL) he handed him this book! So my husband comes home with this book and telling me what the doctor said and it was pretty scary. I need my husband,he is my best friend. We decided that day to give this silly no carb book a try. And hey if it doesn't work we can tell our doctor he is wrong right?But after I actually sat down and read the book it all made sense! It wasn't some &#34;fad diet&#34;, the actual reasons behind it make complete sense to me.<br />It has only been a week,but what a week! Im not going to lie the first 3 days cutting carbs were not fun! It was like what I assume is like a sugar detox! But after that 3rd day I felt like I had better control. 8 days in and I don't miss carbs, I enjoy that what I eat isn't about measuring and guessing,its pretty black and white. I eat as little carbs as I can. I now treat fruit like a dessert (eat it a few days a week), and cook alittle different. Its actually not hard at all, this whole carb free thing! Plus in 8 days I have lost 5lbs!!!! Kinda stoked about that,before it'd take about 3 weeks of stress and extensive workouts to lose 5lbs.<br />Long story short, this is not a diet,it is a lifestyle change. It is not nearly as hard as you would think. I don't count carbs I just don't eat them unless I have too. I highly recommend you read this book,it can change and save your life! Each chapter goes on and on with proof,research and reasons why carbs are bad. I am very thankful our doctor made us read it!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a fantastic read from the first to last page. If you're looking to get into a great action series, you found it.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I really like how pretty this case is. Red is a tricky color and the shade of red they chose for this case is really nice.  The image (words/lettering) is recessed and provides a nice texture. The words are actually names of big cities around the world (New York, Lisbon, Athens, etc.)<br />The kindle is held in place by elastic at each of the four corners. There is a pocket for your left hand to hold the kindle with the case folded back.<br />The only thing missing would be a large elastic to secure the case closed.  Other than that, this is a very nice case.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I did not want to be a Walking Dead fan, I'm tired of the post apocalyptic genre and the Zombie most of all -- you can only do so much with this storyline.  But I watched a few episode and am now a HOOKED fan, like so many others.  This is good drama telling stories about what happens to people's humanity when civilization is decimated, some of them respond with courage and strength others with fear and revenge, and all the while a few bight souls who try against all odds to keep hope alive.  You quickly begin to identify with all these characters, the good and the bad and become invested in the outcome of their surreal lives.
B0058VW36U|5.0|cut the rope is awesome because the levels. get hard each time you win my daughter Katy. loves this game please kelp um.commim
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fascinating to watch the deterioration of the mind. New idea in reading, not the usual mystery or crime novel. Good reading.Our book club choice.
0805079831|5.0|Very informative and enlightning.  Explains much about the fall of many countries - and how some are recovering thirty years later from &#34;free market&#34; economic ideas.  Clearly shows the free market benefits only a few without some regulations in place.  Not an easy read - but worth it if you are interested in what has happened on the globe economically in the last 40 years.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|It didn't work.  Never opened and kept force closing.  0 rating.  Do not waste your time.  Movie was great...this game sucked.
B00280LYHS|5.0|My  son loved  it. It was the best book my son said. You learn about greek gods also. I love it
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought this movie followed the book, for the most part.  Evenso, we're never going to get the detail in a movie as one does from a book.  The sequence of events were in line with the story, and it was great to see how all the characters were dressed out and portrayed, vice having to use one's imagination when reading the book.<br /><br />Overall...great movie, and looking forward to the next one.
1455527475|5.0|Great views from inside one of the largest investment banks in the world.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to business people.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I enjoyed reading this while travelling through airports during a round trip across the country. Wanted to read it before seeing the Lincoln movie.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|A well-received gift for a special Downton fan!  We are treating this series as the BEST in years.  Would highly recommend a purchase even if you have seen it on PBS......amazing what you see and hear on the second and third watch.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Visit this network every day  and love it.Best in the market and well documented. Have been a user since the start of the program and have seen the enhansment and development, as it goes
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game has enough to keep my 6 year old son busy. He can easily achieve the goals in t&a game and isn't always having to buy more coins or items to keep the game going.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|A movie good for anyone married for 30 years+.  You can relate to this situation and maybe even learn something.<br />Hopefully, most couples are not as bad off as they two in separate bedrooms.
1423140605|5.0|I love the series. The book was finished within a week or about 2 weekends. can't wait for the next book
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I'm on my third box set, having sent the first two back for replacement. I'll be sending the third back for a refund. The packaging is awesome, the included book is awesome, the remasters are awesome. The PHYSICAL DISCS ARE GARBAGE. I can't believe the pressings can be this bad, and as I said, I'm on my third try with these. They crackle and pop all over the place; with audible pops even during loud sections of music. Abbey Road is the worst, and even has outright distortion in places, in addition to all the pops and crackling. I know this isn't just my system, because I have other discs, particularly some Silver Label MoFi issues, that are super quiet. I recently purchased several used records from the 80s on eBay, and ALL of them sound significantly better than the first play out of the shrink wrap for these Beatles box set records. This is a heartbreaking disappointment, as I was so, so excited when I heard this box set was coming out. If I hear that Apple/EMI have remedied the situation and changed pressing plants or something, I'll try again. Until then, back to my 24 bit FLAC remasters (which I think was the source for the records anyway).
6305558167|5.0|got it for my cousin for Christmas. he used to watch it when he was younger and couldnt find it and i got it for him
B000HZGNH2|5.0|I never saw the original, but this was a great flick. The cast was amazing along with the plot. It really put Josh Lucas on the map.
1401322786|5.0|I loved The Time Keeper.  I would recommend it for everyone, it really makes you stop and think about things we spend our time in and the things we should be spending time in.  It really makes you search your priorities and think about consequences you<br />may cause by your actions.
B004Y042N8|4.0|Yes it is a simple game. I got this for my husband who had a stroke. It helps with his memory and keeps him challenged enough.<br />I play it too.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|I very much have enjoyed watching the show.  It's fresh and scary and the storylines are pretty original.  Definitely would recommend it to others.
B004CPJC3A|4.0|Like all the truly great composers, Mozart can take many kinds of \\"treatment\\". The romantic approach for which epithets like \\"magic\\" were liberally bestowed on Geza Anda some 60 years ago is no longer fashionable; but that's saying very little. Fashions come and go. Lasting values tend to stay around.<br />This comment is appropriate for No. 23, for which a recorded performance is available of such utter grace and perfection that even these words seem a poor equivalent. This is [[ASIN:B000031WYK Mozart: Piano Concertos no 8, 23 & 24 / Wilhelm Kempff]]. Any pianist up against this recording has an impossible task (which also applies to No. 24). I'm not saying this is a definitive recording - there is no such thing. But perfect in so many ways that testify to a long life lived in the service of this composer.<br />Pollini need not be ashamed of his pianism, even with such competition before him. It is true that he cannot match the wisdom of the grand old man, but his playing leaves little to be desired in terms of elegance. He eschews leanings on the romantic era altogether (as did Kempff), which is why many reviewers felt it was a \\"cold\\" performance. This is too committal: I would say \\"cool\\". Where this version steps down a rung is in the orchestral contribution. Where Leitner matches his man with every tiniest nuance, Böhm is rather bluff and somewhat stodgy. His conducting is almost wholly \\"old school\\" and therefore in striking (and unfavourable) contrast to the young pianist's light fingered finesse.<br />In No. 19, co-operation improves slightly, but not enough to satisfy me that these two artists actually see the work as the same way. However, Böhm does not impose himself; he is content to \\"accompany\\" whenever the soloist is in the spotlight.<br />The frecording is good, clear and clean.<br />All told you cannot go far wrong purchasing this item. This is not saying that in a field replete with dozens of contenders, this particular issue can claim a place rightat thetop.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I have the complete seasons. I have purchased them all off amazon and have never had a problem with any of them. They arrived when quoted they would. Very happy!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had a great time reading this book and I feel like the author did a great job conveying such serious topics, paired with a great love story.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this book!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I have the complete seasons. I have purchased them all off amazon and have never had a problem with any of them. They arrived when quoted they would. Very happy!!
B00005LAGO|5.0|I have loved the Pixies for a long time. It was great to find both albums on one CD. They are very hard to find.
B00ACB9Z3U|5.0|I have all the other seasons so I wanted this season. I am very happy  with the product!! This was a gift I was for Christmas and it arrived exactly when they said it would!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Absolutely the best of the three books. The depth and complexity of the characters and story is terrific. I am truly disappointed there will be no more.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I have the complete seasons. I have purchased them all off amazon and have never had a problem with any of them. They arrived when quoted they would. Very happy!!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|sleek sexy and very well built. it doesn't feel cheap at all and is very secure. Definitely worth the price.
B009EE5SQ4|5.0|I have a list of good movies that I check once a week or so to see if they're on sale.  I don't know if the HD version of this is usually only $10 but Independence Day was on my movie list and it was the cheapest by about 30%.  $10 is an awesome price for an HD movie but especially for a good movie like this.
B001UEBHYS|5.0|Compelling script, wonderful acting, moving core story and amazing visuals.<br />I highly, highly recommend this movie to anyone craving a movie with heart and impact.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I really like this compact little case.  It looks great and weighs almost nothing.  That's a good thing when I'm carrying my Kindle in my purse.  However, I don't think this would be too helpful if I were to drop it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I liked the twists and turns of the story.  It was a page turner for me and I wanted more when I was finished.<br />I may read it again before too long
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Great film.  DVD quality fine.<br /><br />One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten.  Why do I have to say more?
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This gams is addicting.  I play this game with my nieces and absolutely enjoy it.<br />I highly recommend this to any young girl or those young at heart.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Guess it's rather naive to think all this clandestine stuff doesn't ' really happen. Flynn spins one heck of a good story; another page turning Mitch Rapp adventure. I give it 5 stars for the sheer pleasure of reading about killing bad guys who want to do harm to the US. Rapp does it as well as anyone.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Me gusto mucho este libro por que de principio a fin le da giros muy interesantes e inesperados a la historia
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I love anything Judi Dench does.  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was entertaining, but I felt that the characters were not as fully developed as they could have been.
140053271X|5.0|I brought it for gift and price was right. I think she was very happy with it and she love to reads.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider by MobilityWare.  Enjoyed playing this game.  Can be very challenging when adding an additional suit.  I can't imagine winning if playing with 4 suits.
0307454568|5.0|I ordered this book as part of the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo to read before I saw the movie. All three of these books were awesome.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|I hope that one day in the near future Hollywood will understand that the American population is not a nation of complete idiots, and that we cannot be force-fed stupid clich&eacute;s one after another with big shiny explosions to keep our minds busy. This film simply put...missed!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|gripping storyline and beautifully executed with sunning intriguing visuals,loved the first 5episodes cant wait to see the whole season and more!
B009NUV0E8|5.0|For anyone who grew up in the 90's, this is the greatest Bond movie of all time. The villains, the car, the gadgets, it has it all. And anyone who had a Nintendo 64 knows especially where I am coming from!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved this story, all of it, everything about it. Already bought it as a gift for my friend's daughter also. Every family should read this book together. Has such a good moral.
B001TODO54|3.0|I like Graceling, but it just isn't enough. Especially after re-reading it a few weeks ago, I just find myself a little disappointed. The story centers way too much on the romance between the two characters, and it just bugs me. There's so much more to this story than her not wanting to marry yada-yada. Also, the presumptuous &#34;for&#34; made me want to rip out my eyeballs. (Meaning, all those &#34;I went to the market today, for we were out of milk.&#34; sentences.) I understand that it seems to be a part of medieval speaking whatever, but it just was too much. It was trying too hard.<br /><br />You are kept wondering about what all exactly is going on (why the king's father was kidnapped, ect.) so overall the author did a pretty good job.
0385720920|5.0|The book was one cent and it was completely new, no sign of have been used. the book also arrived immediately.
B00004W221|5.0|Very inspiring movie. It shows that with grit and determination a goal can be accomplished. I used to show parts of this to my classes at school to motivate those that felt math was too difficult to learn.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|It was  excellent one of the best musicals ever made I highly recommend it to anyone who likes family type movies.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have always had a fascination with this era, and what truly happened on that fateful day.  This book was well written and I really enjoyed all the twists and turns it had to offer.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I am a nerd/geek and love the show. I have purchased all seasons on dvd/bluray. It is funny to think back and realize that I actually did some of the same stuff these guys did when I was in school.
B009X01C64|5.0|I liked the Fire HD's design and aesthetic, but it needs some protection in a house with a 2 year old. I popped the tablet into this thing and it seems permanent enough. I half-heartedly tried getting it back out to see how snuggly its in there, and it didn't budge. The swivel mechanism works smoothly and simply, though I have not used the portrait mode more than once. The elastic closure is as simple as it needs to be. Overall, it maintains a low profile and provides ample protection.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|This Mission Impossible was an entertaining movie. I would recommend that people watch it at least once but not buy it unless they have urge they need fulfilled.
034580404X|5.0|LOVE this series! I was interested in these books because of the publicity and I was not disappointed. Highly recommended read
B009NPKTN6|5.0|ok, not academy award material, but great songs, humor and if you find yourself taking life too seriously then check it out
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I use to love action movies,but this is not one of them. &#34;Hollyweird&#34; and the &#34;screen writing guild&#34; seem think they are being creative by adding cameo's  actor like Norris,Willis and Schwarzenegger . Sorry &#34;I willn't be back for more&#34;!
044024630X|5.0|A woman shoots herself right in front of Reacher on a New York Metro train.  All the authorities want to shut down the case as a mere suicide, but Reacher thinks there is something more sinister about the death, especially when there is a connection with a U.S. Senator.  Not only does our hero have to battle a team of Ukrainian terrorist, but the New York police, and the FBI as well.<br />The final showdown is as bloody as it is thrilling.  You won't be able to put this book down.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game. I would recommend it to ages 7 and up. It doesn't end, you can replay it as many times as  you'd like. You can unlock different characters for free also.  I play it when waiting for something, because it is very time consuming. THIS IS  WORTH YOUR TIME!!!!!!!! :D
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|i got this game on my kindle and its really neat u draw ur way to adventure!!! defintly get this game!!!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It's preparing me for middle school and making me want to go to military school because I'm wimpy too but all and all awesome.

B00280LYIM|5.0|Great fourth book to this AWESOME book series!! READ THE OTHER BOOKS BEFORE THIS ONE, THOUGH!! Read this AWESOME book!<br />This review is by AtlantaMom3\\"Ashley fan\\"'s daughter :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm hooked on this English Series.  I can't say enough about it. The story has so many angles, twists and turns.  I love the women's fashions....the acting is first rate.  My only disappointment, so far, is that Robert was caught off guard with Jane...I expected more from him. I don't think an affair between the two of them would add much to the story, so I was happy that Jane left with her honor intact.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Love that he's come back to where he started.  This book is full of twists and turns.  I recommend it for all Grisham fans!
B0012YYZYK|5.0|I've owned &#34;TSRTS&#34; in virtually every possible format: VHS, DVD, cassette, vinyl and CD. As each newer technology has become available, I've always enjoyed the improvements to the audio and video quality.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version continues that trend, especially in regards to the video quality. It's huge jump from the very murky VHS version that I first had in the 1980s, and it polishes the improvements of the DVD I had in the '90s/'00s.<br /><br />If you are familiar with the earlier releases of &#34;TSRTS,&#34; the bonus footage of the tracks that were not previously included is a very enjoyable bonus, too.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Suspension of reality is what draws me into a good story. This one hooked me from the start. I wasn't looking for another conspiracy theory story about the Kennedy assassination. This book is far from it. A true story teller Mr. King is. A departure from his usual writing. A nice change of pace and I highly recommend to anyone looking for an escape.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|i upgraded motherboard and cpu and memory at same time so cant say for certain what helped the most but it is faster in everyway then my old i5 650 dual core 3.2 ghz i got this a gigabyte g1 killer sniper m3 and a g skill 2 sticks kit of 4 gb(8gb total) 1600 mhz ram
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This was an easy read and pretty predictable for the most part. It was enjoyable but nothing that I would consider \\"great\\".
B009SSGBOE|4.0|I love Fagen's soundscapes! Always have, always will. His lyrical content on the CD leaves me cold. They may speak volumes to others but his words on this work escape my interest.
0061730335|5.0|This is an excellent book of how a child growing up in Africa copes with drought, and being hungry. He teaches himself how to make electricity using the tools that he has around him. It is on our ladies church unit reading list.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Although I wish Dexter could find happiness, I do LOVE this series so I really don't want it to ever end!
B007SPPANM|5.0|Great cast, great story, great special effects.  Certainly has your imagination reeling and your cheering for the love-birds.<br />Recommended movie.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have watched this an embarrassing number of times on YouTube, so it was time I coughed up some cash for the brilliant DVD.  Almost every voice here is stunning, and while I  liked the movie a great deal, there's a lot to be said for hearing this amazing score sung so beautifully.  Buy it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was downloaded on a whim, I needed something new to read and come across it for free.  I am so pleased I downloaded it.  It is funny,sexy and sweet rolled into a wonderful package.  If you are a sucker for romance this is a great book for you!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The wire/cable is tougher than I thought it would be, too. That's good, because I'm hard on cables. Thanks alot.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|As my title says, \\"Good HSF for the buck\\", it does its job good at keeping my phenom ii x4 960t cool at 31c idle and 40c load at almost 10c cooler then stock specially since i now run f@h 24/7. next is a new case and mobo, but thats later, anyways, it would get 5* if the instructions were more clear(others said the same too), thankfull for youtube on that part. last, but not least, if you have a small case, you may not fit the cm hyper 212+ into it as some people found out the hard way, in other words, CHECK HOW MUCH SPACE YOU HAVE IN YOUR CASE WITH MOBO BEFORE BUYING A AFTERMARKET HSF as almost all are tall and/or wide with some weight on some models.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this show!!! It never grows old, i hope it goes until 10 seasons!!! On the episode titled Repo Man, the demon says it's \\"Back in Black.\\" Dean then replies, \\" Oh, go to hell!!!\\" That was so funny!! If your a true fan, you know Dean loves the rock song 'Back in Black'. I love this show. May it live on forever!!! Definitely worth every dollar!!!
B005IGDW24|1.0|and they still putting on the 3d bluray that they have but they don't the just want to sell I am so!!!!!!!!!!!!! mad.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Amazon.com, from my point of view, has the best selection of books in English and I find that often their recommendations are valuable. I chose a five star rating because it is probably the best book I have read in a long time, As a writer she is right up there with the big boys. I found this book advertised on the front of my Kindle then asked for an example. After reading the excerpt and falling in love with the book I ordered it and was not disappointed.<br /><br /> I liked it because it was exteremly well written. There are a myriad of characters each more interesting than the other or of no apparent interest at all. She weaves a fantastic tale of a night circus and how it came into being. Her description of the various personages is exquisitly detailed  right down to the last sequin. Her adroitness at pulling them all together is sheer genius. The book in exciting and most entertaining. The end befits a great book and shows an ability of putting the final touches that so many writers sadly do not possess.<br /><br />There are more twists and turns than<br />one can imagine, illusion, deception and some unexpected surprises. I loved the ending because it fulfills a romantic fantasy.<br /><br />I would recommend  this book to anyone who truely enjoys good literature, exciting and well narrated with a vocabulary fitting the delicious story. I loved it and am sure that everyone who reads will love it, too. It is truly a great read.<br /><br />Bookwormetc<br />Dorothy Pardo
1451688091|5.0|This is an exceedingly well researched and well written book.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in this period of history.  It details in so far as possible the interaction among members of the Lincoln cabinet and their interaction with the President.  You will love the book.  Be prepared to concentrate while reading to get the most out of the book.
B0050C863G|5.0|I have the high energy and attention span of a gnat... this book is great.. I use the website [...] and had decided I just wanted to know more about Andy... and learn about meditation from his teachings and point of view... love the book... love the website...
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Good book read the book please. That is a good book!!!! Read the dude book on raw book!! I will
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thought provoking dark comedy with plenty of surprises. I'll definitely be reading more Gillian Flynn titles in the future. Good read!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Nice family movie  There was no violence and only moderate cursing. It wAs a romantic comedy without overt sexual content  that also addressed family conflict. Very enjoyable
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It is disgusting to think that this was a best seller. Tells a lot about this country and the filth that is being printed. Not necessary to go into way too much sex. Someone gave me the others and I was also disgusted and  insulted. Feel this world of ours is so sick. We need to get back to some interesting and amusing and real stories that depict society that we can be proud of. Young gals sitting engrossed on the beach, speaks alot about our society and relationshios that are starving for sex. Wrong things...
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was okay. Didn't like the letter styling much. Not my type of book but still one I enjoyed reading.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Love this movie for Christmas.  Remake can't beat the original.  Great with color pictures too becaue you can see all details.
B000002LSV|5.0|these guys have been around forever with their great sound and style. a keeper of an album if you only buy one!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I was so happy to find this movie. It's hard to believe it has been around for so long. Will enjoy it with my grandkids for years.Thank  you for the fast service.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Caution when leaving car....connection does not disconnect.  That is the only downside.  Have to turn it off or move very far from the car.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|This being a true story made this movie even more interesting.  I enjoyed this movie and will watch it again some day.
0345529057|5.0|This was a great deal. I bought these as a Christmas present for my girlfriend and she flipped out. She has been reading them like crazy.
B0001I55OC|5.0|Good movie.  Action packed, periodical, a little romance and time travel!  Great for those who like all these aspects in a movie.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Nice book that gives you opportunity to explore basic moments of conversation, from only thinking about it and first steps until the very end. If u the person want to start from very beginning this book is sure for you!
B002RSDW80|3.0|I would not see this movie again although, for the most part, I liked it.  I learned about Julia Childs husband and the great relationship they had.  Meryl Streep really nailed this role!  Amy Adams was great too.  The french lady who was her partner was very endearing.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|it helped me finish a school project by allowing me to have a light under my poster. I was able to trace what I needed with ease. I highly recommend it.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|This movie held my interest.  Although I would not watch it again.  I think it could have been written better.
B008RYN44U|5.0|So glad they gave us another great album! This album has a lot of the Tragic Kingdom feel to it.
B004TI5N38|4.0|The hero, &#34;Puller&#34; is army all the way, and he makes a great protagonist in this novel as the army sends him on a virtually impossible mission as a &#34;one man band&#34;.  Baldacci makes the hero, setting and story come to life, set in the backwoods of West Virginia, an unlikely spot, but well describe by the author.  I recommend it, with a follow up of the most recent Baldacci, &#34;The Forgotten,&#34; with a return of Puller as the hero!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love their music.  You won't be disappointed with their first CD.  I became familiar with their music on YouTube and now I can enjoy it without interruption.  I would highly recommend this CD.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really like this game, it's very time consuming and very interesting. I recommend this game to all gamers because it's just so fun.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I am really enjoying this series.  It has alot of imagination and creative ideas.  I recommend this to anyone who has an interest in science fiction
0810989956|5.0|my 9 years old like dairy of a Wimpy kid and he is collecting them all. He like to read them over and over ;now he is making his story in Do it Yourself
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I installed the batteries and charged over night it has been working fine so far. Even forget to re-charge some nights and the charge has lasted for the second day.<br /><br />Works as advertised.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how long the batteries last (i.e. ability to keep a charge).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book because it was sad, happy, fun, awful, loving, and everything in between! Holder is amazing ~ his love would make any girl melt! I love that this wasn't your typical love story. It was gritty and real ... but in the end that's exactly what true love is.
B000001EYW|4.0|I had this on cassette and wore it out, so this crisp, clean CD was a great find.  I would recommend it to my friends.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I watched it with my 80 year old mom.  She loved it.  Of course she watched Julia Child as a young mom so it brought back lots of great memories.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was one of the best that I've ever read.  Started out a little slow, but most of that was character development.  I read all three books in 4 days.  I could not put them down and was sorry when it came to an end.
0393342212|5.0|This is a really good book, very well organized, with many many real-life examples and principles. I can see my family in these examples and the principles make me think more about how I want my kids be and myself be.<br /><br />BTW, the authors have another book \\"how to talk\\", which is also excellent. I felt I learnt a lot from both books. Highly recommended.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Buy this Blu ray disc.  Watch scenes 14 and 15 on a large screen, 5.1 sound system.  If you are not deeply moved, your are dead.  This is the pinnacle of cinematic art, showing its power and potential to communicate like no other art form.<br /><br />The film stands as a whole, of course, but the content and expertise of these two scenes stand apart.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie looked to be funny by the trailer, but it turned out to be a disappointment.  I only finished it because I paid to stream it.  Would not recommend this one!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book wove you through the historical south from beginning to end. You couldn't help but root for the main character and her &#34;family&#34;. Truly shows that a blood bond isn't the only definition of family. Perfect combination of action,suspense,and romance.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A must read!!!!! I fell in love with Dean Holder, warm and caring! Twist and turns!! Some so unexpected, you won't be disappointed
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy the challenge of Flow Free.  It is an app on all my portable devices.  Great on the the go brain sharpener.
B002PHVHFI|5.0|Great album, arrived fast, cool artwork, and the track listing sheet inside the sleeve is very cool.<br /><br />I noticed there are a lot of 1-star reviews, all of which claim this record to be a poor listen... Don't listen to these people. They bought a vinyl record of a band hadn't even listened to before... Here's a tip to those people: go to YouTube, type in &#34;Neutral Milk Hotel&#34; and listen to all of the songs for free. Not your taste? Oh, then don't buy the record!<br />I had this on a CD in 2007-ish, and it's always been one of my very favorites. The vinyl is great quality, and I for one love not worrying about the quality of a file or finding a lostless version; on vinyl, it sounds how it's supposed to.<br />GREAT buy.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider is my reward for hard work.  Also it is a quick brain exercise.  I play two or three games everyday.  I like it.
0688014291|5.0|I purchased this book simply to improve my ability to manage and supervise.  This book was informative and easy to understand.  Gave a lot of useful hints and is good for anyone looking for the basics of managing.
0307387178|4.0|I ordered this for my son and daughter. Their high school requires all students to read a certain book over the summer months and this year it was &#34;Into the Wild&#34;. My 12th grader read it with no problem, but my 9th grader had difficulty. It is written on a junior/senior to college reading level and I had to help her interpret a lot of the story. I read it myself and really liked it.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Listening to this box set was like listening to the Beatles the first time all over again.  Sound was excellent with a warmth you will not find on CD.  This is what the way the John, Paul, George, and Ringo wanted their music to sound.
B0098460O4|4.0|After seeing the youtube clips on their performances on BGT show I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. These two are so talented and we admire Jonathan for keeping elizabeth with him. Beautiful music
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Best Santa Claus Movie i've ever seen especialyl for Adults..  Iv'e never seen one better.<br />I bought 4 copies for my adult children
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is fantastic and kept me glued to my Kindle for hours on end.  The story is great and the cast is well-chosen.  I strongly recommend.
1423140605|5.0|I have only read a few pages from it and i can say that i a m hooked it has a great plot
B005WUHAX8|3.0|When case arrived the packaging was torn and when the actual case was taken out there was two very noticeable scratches on the screen cover. Other than that good case
B000GT4H0Y|1.0|really bad, I've wanted to see this for years for some stupid reason.<br /><br />Don't be tempted like me.<br /><br />waste of time.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is a kind of book that will touch you deeply! It's one of those books that makes you understand that coincides are more than just the lapping of events. They are signs from the earth!
B005R32L66|5.0|Great app! Works well on my tablet. My oogle Play doesn't always work. Will download more from Amazon apps. No problems found at all.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Love Channing and Joe!!  Anyone who says they are watching it for the storyline is lying!  Fun girls night in movie!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great app! Works well on my tablet. My Google Play doesn't always work. Will download more from Amazon apps. No problems found at all.
B00899E7VM|5.0|There are probably a lot of folks who don't know who RTF are or what fusion jazz is all about.  Well, forget the labels.  This is great music, period.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I received my car charger much quicker then expected.  Works great and didn't have to pay what I would have in stores!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it.  Totally free game.  Extremely entertaining.  Not many games out there with so many levels of play without trying to draw you in to paying for something more.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Simply charming! =)<br />I loved the movie and was thrilled to see it was based off a book so I just had to read it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this for my son and he  loves it.  Very nice product.  Very well made. Would recommend this to any Kindle Fire user.
0790729628|5.0|Directors cut of Blade Runner! What more can I say.<br />This is one of the jewels of my DVD collection.<br /><br />Helmut
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you have kids or your kid has a Kindle or an I pad or something this is like the best game ever!! its so fun! way better then Temple run. WAY BETTER! I seriously recommend this to ANYONE! its seriously great!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love love love the ending! It really couldn't be any better! I really can't wait to watch the book come to life in the movie but hope they don't mess it up!!
B009YU62H2|4.0|I really love Soundgarden. King Animal is a nice start back for these guys, but there are really only a few songs I really like. Nothing is bad here per usual Soundgarden, but not quite as kick ass as some of their older stuff. Badmotorfinger is the bomb.
0143036742|4.0|An entertaining poignant story where many home truths revealed about human nature with humour and sympathy. The writing is energetic and resourceful  creating wonderful picture of the various colourful characters.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|I'm in my mid-twenties, so I'm not the average screaming teenage fan that One Direction normally has. That being said, these guys and their songs bring back the giddy feelings and memories I had as a teen when I loved NSync and Backstreet Boys, so I may be a little biased.<br /><br />I really like this album. I think I liked more songs from their first album, but the songs on this one are more likable, if that's possible. There are a few songs I could care less for (Change My Mind, for example, because of what the song is very much implying), but otherwise this is the album I go to and listen to just about all the time.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I first read this book when I was in about 4th grade...nearly 50 years ago, and it is still a favorite.  I highly recommend it!  I have several movies as well, but nothing beats the original book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|CANNOT WAIT to read part 3, definitely a page TURNER START to finish... I love books that have a Great story line
B009B0L324|3.0|I love AC/DC - this was not as great as I expected.  Not bad, but the older live disc is better - just doesn't have the newer cuts.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|good book. martin has a very stark style that can seem long winded at times, but the random plot twists tend to make it worth it
1449410243|5.0|Great book , I was giving it as a gift but had to read it first! perfect for any crazy cat people!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|but with absolutely terrible writing. while i enjoyed the way it navigated the intricacies of a relationship, it's a fantasy world where almost everything came easy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great story and could not put it down but very sad at the end.  I cannot wait to start the next book.  Just hope it pick up where it left off.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|but with terrible writing. also controversially throws the ideas and acts of BDSM into a bad light, where if you enjoy these things, then you must have some traumatized experiences and unmet needs
B0057GYOA4|5.0|This is a great CD, it was way cheaper to buy it here than at Target!  My son loves it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|the characters seem kind of flat. then again, it is the first book. the writing is kind of eh. I only picked it up because there was so much press about it
1904994679|5.0|These books are so cool, i love reading these and looking at the pictures.  I buy one every single year.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely fifty shades! Love this trilogy! I was engulfed in the story from the first chapter. Definitely would recommend! Awesome!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read almost every one of David Baldacci novels and have never been disappointed.  &#34;The Innocent&#34; is no exception.  It's a &#34;can't put it down&#34; thriller.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this.  game.  is.  so.  cool.  I.  think.  this.  game.  is.  is.  like.  awesomely.  awesome.  I.  think.  my.  hole.  family.  include Inge.  me
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|I love this snorkle!!!! If this is what your looking for get it!!!! Its so nice to just keep swimming with out any worries other then your heart giving out on you????? Rule number one.... this is not for the kids to play with.......
B000VDDDVO|4.0|Great Service and gave as a Christmas gift .. bought 2 of them.!!  Arrived just in time for me to give as a gift.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is excellent an interesting world, a novel magic system, deep character development. Its everything good about fantasy with some very unique flora and beasts.<br /><br />How does a gravity ninja sound to you? Pretty cool right? Ya well you'll actually care about that dude on a personal level, too cool.<br /><br />Seriously good stuff, this book was recommended (the most recommended in their book section...and these dudes are nerds like me) to me by my internet bros and I'm happy to say they absolutely right. Only thing is now I have to pine for the next one to come out. Pick your poison people, good fantasy and some book-withdrawal or w/e you just happen to find.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I love this movie, it came just in time for us to watch it and get ready for the holidays.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Did not see the ending coming with Kevin or even jo. I can't wait to see the movie. Overall a great read.
B009A9BEHU|4.0|Product arrived quickly, but case was completely smashed.  CD / DVD work great though!  Glad I could relive the experience.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I wanted to read this before seeing the movie and hadn't read it in school for some strange reason. I must admit that the descriptive nature of Hugo's writing was very tedious for me, I kept thinking &#34;ok ok I get it, now move on!&#34;
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Now THIS is how the Judge should be shown! This movie RULES! I think all these big time directors and producers in Hollywood need to look at this movie all around. I would challenge the acting in this movie to any (as far as pure action/ sci-fi) and even some \\"serious\\" movies that seem to always get nominated for awards.This movie has substance and a great story. The acting is well above average also. No intelligence robbing, obvious one liners, just all Dredd business!<br /><br />I read Dredd (2000 AD) growing up and the pure gritty-ness of this movie portrays just how our society will someday feed on each other just like the comics showed. The best part is this doesn't portray some radical over the top post apocalyptic view of our world, but it seems like a not too distant one. The way the movie makers made you feel like this could be your life as soon as tomorrow was a huge attraction to this film. Most can usually tell what direction a movie is going in or the characters' emotions being played out, NOT Dredd! You wont have a clue to what is going to happen next or who its going to happen to and that is rare for sci-fi.<br /><br />With the ridiculous collection of sci-fi films that I own (from the original When Worlds Collide to the rebooted Total Recall and everything in-between), this rates pretty high up there. I've read some folks' comments on the effects and how they are not that great, but I completely disagree. The work that went into some of the shots and lighting are amazing! And not to be a total downer, but man, if your tripping on mushrooms or some other wild stuff, Dredd will definitely blow your mind!<br /><br />This is not a movie to dissect, this is one to just sit back to, let your imagination go and hang the hell on! I guarantee you'll be screaming \\"mama\\" when your done watching!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|loved the poetry and the Avett Brothers lyrics at the beginning of each chapter...book motivated me to find a poetry slam in my area.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Not much comment, just a perfect musical CD that I bought before~you won't be regret after u bought it, and will enjoy it very much~
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I had this movie on VHS when I was younger & I was excited to find that I was now on DVD. It was exactly as I remembered it. The seller was great & the DVD arrived before Christmas which was a big plus because we were able to enjoy it.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This was an awesome movie from start to finish. Like usual, Levitt was great. I also really liked Emily Blunt as well.
B00AKKGX4W|1.0|After starting & stopping the book 3 times, I finally gave up.  It just couldn't hold my interest.  I decided my time was worth more than I paid for the book.
B00ARAO720|4.0|When my husband told me we were watching an action movie about bike messengers, I was quite skeptical. Honestly, the only reason I gave it a chance is because I typically like movies with Joseph Gordon Levitt.<br />I gave it a chance and found it to be fast paced and exciting. So if you are looking for a different type of action, give it a shot!
0345535421|5.0|This book deals more with the wars in Westeros, the bitter fight to be king after the death of Robert, and the ruthlessness of each warring party.  There is little blood and guts, little about the zombie aspect, but very engrossing as each chapter is from a viewpoint of the main players.  I'm finding I quite like Tirion, even tho he is from the evil family of Lannister, he is much misunderstood and really has a good heart, most of the time.  I'm glad I didn't live in times like this.  I highly recommend the book for those that like fantasy mixed with realism mixed with mystery mixed with &#34;whatsnext&#34;.  I'm going to read the entire book series as well as purchase the cable tv episodes.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I was hoping it would be free in Prime like the series is but it was worth the small charge.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I am so glad that this series has brought &#34;to light&#34; the dark side of this complicated character.  I love it on so many levels.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|I watched this several times to see if I could pick up some parts of the story line I may have missed  the first time.<br /> It helped but not enough to keep me glued to it.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|I liked this one the best it was more action packed than the others in this series, Salander was a great personality.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|During my time in the USAF (60 to 63) I became a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs. When I found his John Carter<br />series, I pretty much devoured them. I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie paralleled the book fairly good.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought this book was amazing Jeff kinny is a great author and these books just never get old!!!!! I read through this one in a day and I already can't wait for more
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I was one of the lucky people who didn't know the ending when I first watched it. A well made Sci Fi flick with<br />a great ending.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app! I hate my loud annoying alarm clock and this wakes me up in the morning gently and easily. You can force yourself to wake up by doing math problems and it has so many alarm sounds to choose from. I can even change the background color, the title of the alarm, and save them so they show up right there on the home page when you need them. It's so easy to disable or enable an alarm quickly, and it counts down to when your alarm will ring, making it easy for me to keep track of how long I sleep.<br />All this to say, DOWNLOAD THIS! And for free, it'll be one of the best buys you've made. I love it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn did a great job on this book, in fact I liked it so much I bought sharp things.<br />The format was a great way to tell this story, she makes you feel sorry for &#34;girl&#34; one page then hate her the next.<br />I did not expect the ending.<br />great job
B001FVD65O|5.0|Love Bruce Willis in fact the entire Die Hard series.  It's nice to go back and review the older movies of the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I absolutely love the relationship between Sky and Holder and how both of them helped the other find what the true meaning of life really is all about.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|This is a solid product which I expect to last for quite some time. It looks nice, the plastic holding mechanism is precisely manufactured, and the landscape (movie) setup works great.<br /><br />Two major flaws, each accounting for a loss of a review star:<br /><br />- When I first unpacked it I almost got high by the smell of the oil related substances the artificial leather appears to be drenched in. The inside suede material is lovely and would have done the trick for me to be used in all places of this product. This artificial leather is a shame, and they really need to to replace it by a different material (for $25 I think real leather can actually be expected..?) I can also feel a clear tingling in my hands every time after touching it which I attribute to the chemicals in the artificial leather, and I'm actually somewhat concerned about that!<br /><br />- Two obvious design flaws:<br />1) The rubber band could have been offset by a centimeter so as to not cover the audio connector, and act as an additional aid to locate the volume switch just by feeling without having to look.<br />2) No charging or HDMI out when the case is closed because the corresponding connectors are covered. An easy solution would have been to manufacture a hole at that place. Has no-one tested the design before going into mass production..?
B00870Z9HY|5.0|This is probably the only filmed version of Love Never Dies that will ever be made, so it is a good thing they did great job. The quality of the production is very high. The leads are excellent, Ben Lewis in particular. The changes to the book are positive, although I'm not convinced that opening with Till I Hear You Sing is best. The ending is much more effective. Definitely worth a look.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is a great cd, has all of the hits you want to hear including the duet with Jason Aldeen
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I really like the life proof case and all but there are some down falls to it. You can only have the original iPhone charger with it because the slot for the charger is to small. Also when I talk on the phone it's hard for the person on the other line to hear me. Other than that I really like it
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell inspires you to reflect on your past and the advantages and people who helped you to succeed. You then must ask how can we give our children the advantages they need to succeed today.
1616890835|5.0|Very informative book for new signs painters. A look inside look at tecniques used by the pros helps out a  new painter
B0084AXZK0|4.0|It was a vivid retelling of the times in which this takes place. In Wildes beautiful language you are there.
030758836X|2.0|I was anxious to read this book because I had heard so many good reviews.  However, when I tried to read it, I could not get past the first 50 pages.  The writing style is truncated and has no flow.  The characters are not likable - self-centered, egotistical, few redeeming qualities. I forced myself to read 50 pages and then closed it for good.<br />It may be a generational issue.  I like flow to writing and the truncated communication seems a reflection of texting.  Who knows, but this one was a dud for me.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|Just got this about a week ago.  Not being familiar with Two Steps From Hell, I can honestly say, I have been looking for their music my entire life.  Except for \\"Back to the Earth\\", which appears to be universally disliked, it is a fantastic album.  The music is big, sweeping, full of sound, fathoms deep with soaring heights.  Buy it, put it on a good player and close your eyes and listen(except for \\"Back to Earth\\", skip that one, you'll thank yourself).
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This is definitely a step up from the version with Rob Schneider.  It's probably worth the rental fee if you had enough interest to start checking out reviews on Amazon.
0802130208|2.0|I spent the whole of 2012 reading non-fiction strictly and for 2013, this was one of the fiction books I was eagerly looking forward to tackling.  Turning to the forward I was even more enthused when I read about how this book was published post-humously and won the Pulitzer. I was pretty disappointed with the results. The story is just dull and long-winded stuffed with characters that are outright unlikable. Ignatius is somebody whom you completely despise and by the time you creep to the last pages, hopes will suffer a terrible fate. Even reading the blurbs on the back cover you read much about \\"laugh out loud\\" statements. Never happened. A single page from \\"Catch 22\\" elicited more genuine laughs than this entire story. I don't know if I ever loathed a main character more. He's a fat, lazy and unhygienic slob that seems to sidestep trouble with equal parts intelligence and the unrealistic gullibility of his adversaries. I'll at least concede that as you're rambling through 400 pages of a rather boring story, Toole does do a competent job of wrapping the story up and tying together the mesh of characters involved. It's just not worth the journey.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|As good as, or better than, the first season.  VaVoom to Miss Adler in &#34;Scandal in Belgravia&#34;.  What a twist from the prior versions of her!  &#34;Hounds&#34;  is interestingly different too, with another side to our Sherlock emerging. (The tension created by the outside lights going on and off is wicked).  &#34;Reichenbach Fall&#34; provides another cliffhanger -which will leave your nickers in a twist waiting for season 3.  Watch for all of the subtle clues that run throughout this series; and which may, if you're a good PI, provide you with some additional entertainment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie but I have to say that this book is ten times better. I was completely mesmerized by the hunger games and its futuristic characters. Can't wait to read the rest!
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I downloaded this for my brother.  I remember reading this in high school.  It's one of those classic stories that's a tragedy, but so well told.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing story, I couldnt put it down until I finished it! The story line is so believeable, I would hope that it might give some the strength found in the same situation to be as strong as her!
B009O2XY12|5.0|I am very addictive to this game! I recommend everyone that sees this review to download immediately! I played the free game and purchased other games also! DID I MENTION HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This was a sort of technology vs. old-fashioned reading from paper.  Not nearly as good as a thought it would be.
1609611543|4.0|I found this book quite interesting.  Enough so, that I've decided to give it a try.  As of January 2, 2013, my husband and I have been eating wheat free.  As said in the book, it is a challenge to find anything in a can without wheat.  We were surprised when we started reading labels.  I already eat pretty healthy with a minumin of sugar in my diet.  I've lost about 4 pounds, but I could do this before the holidays.  I'm curious to see how much weight I can lose and how much healthier I'll feel over the course of the year.<br />The downside to the book, was a tendency to drag on abit.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Only had in VHS so we had to rent it for family movie night. Kids watched it several times! Love it!
0739375970|5.0|People often complain that the 4th and 5th books don't contain enough action and movement... but they more than make up for it in the evolution of the politics and characters of the world. While the 3rd book might have been a series of slaps to the face that leave you questioning what could happen next, A Dance with Dragons IS what happens next. More important characters are introduced, our understanding of the world is broadened and things that were only stories and riddles before start to be realized.
034580404X|5.0|This is a fun read.  I'm not too &#34;moved&#34; by it and I think that's because I have not lived a sheltered enough life.  But they are good for road trips and killing time.
B005KXT58U|5.0|I saw them in concert - which was free from my friend who wanted company. I did not know they were originally mistaken for a Christian Rock group.  But I found I knew quite a bit of their music and so I bought the albums...found them on sale.  I would like to see more new stuff on them now.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Brisingr, the third book answers so many questions about Eragon.  I loved it.... could hardly put it down.  Liked it even better than the first two books.The character development and intricate magic drew me in.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the show, its smart and very funny.  Try it!  You may love it too. Seeing these geeky guys learn the ways of the world around them is hilarious.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I dont like the gay dating service pop ups I have to get around every time I want to play a game of  solitaire. To much of a pain in the butt, deleted.
B002RKSZS0|1.0|The sentences go on and on and on. In this particular book...the author uses 40 words where the same story could have been drawn with only 15 or 20. I bored of the constant going on and to describe the same thing. I removed it from my cue. (and this from a die hard Jane Austin fan)
B004LWZW8I|4.0|Better storyline, better characters, less stupid sex, actors were fine in both though.<br />I almost became interested in the :&#34;gods&#34; as people.<br />Storyline suffered at the end as do most mythic tales but<br />it was still enjoyable storytelling and almost made a little sense.<br />Even my wife agrees with me on this one!
0757302661|5.0|I had a vbac thanks to this book, really helped with visualization and breathing through my labour, and beyond when times get tough
B0034G4P80|5.0|Great entertainment! Great storyline with the earthling girl involvement and the great graphics.<br />My wife loved it too Worth seeing again!!!
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Nothing too crazy here, just raw action which is what I was looking for. Special effects are spectacular and not overused. Simple, yet interesting plot. I really hope they make a sequel to this.
6305949980|5.0|Very good product.<br />Very good care by the owner.<br />I can recommend it to my friends to make purchases in this company.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the way life was lived in England for a time, and despite the &#34;class&#34; system,it' so easy to be sympathetic towards this aristocratic family and their problems. It puts us in a different world.
B005LAII8K|5.0|4.6 stars<br /><br />I knew nothing of this going in, which made it even better. If you too know nothing of it but love Blade Runner, Inception and other mind-benders, then stop reading these reviews and enjoy the many surprises awaiting you in Looper.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, I'll just say I love a great time travel story, as it opens so many avenues of plot and thought, and this one avoids many of the usual cliches. Rian Johnson wrote a sweet, tight script and directed it to near perfection, getting fine performances from everyone and probably Levitt's best turn to date. The score is subtle but tense and fitting, the costumes likewise, and the sets and especially street shots are state of the art, very believably dystopian.<br /><br />What makes it all work are the concepts, some of which I've never encountered, and I've seen almost every time travel flick ever made; it's a genre I love. One thing the careful watcher will see over and over here are lens flares, which somehow fit in much better than usual (except in the work of Ridley Scott, the original flare-master). I don't think I've ever seen so many flares in one film, but Johnson always sets them up as part of the shot composition and it really works. This film looks great in general, in fact.<br /><br />The blu-ray helps that along with a perfect transfer and excellent sound. There's almost an hour of extras, including a few nice docs about the making of and a fine little piece about the score with a few wonderful sonic tricks explained, like sampling the sounds of the \\"gat\\" gun and then playing them in pitch as a drum set. Very cool indeed.<br /><br />All in all, Looper was one of the best cinematic surprises I've had in a long time, and clearly a sign that Johnson and Levitt are both headed for the top of their respective professions.<br /><br />An intelligent, beautifully shot film highly recommended for all fans of sci-fi and thrillers, Looper is bound to be a cult classic.
B0036G8IQS|4.0|It is a good no great book for science fiction and kids everywhere. You should read it to  sincerely, Darby
B005LAII3U|4.0|3.8 stars<br /><br />Farrell and Beckinsale are both good here, and this new TR is very well made. It fairly gleams visually, and moves well with good stunts and effects; overall it's worth seeing, but then I love PK Dick and think anything based on his ideas is worth considering.<br /><br />Yet I always loved the cheese and humor of the Ahnold Recall, and this one plays it all too straight. Hardly any laughs at all, which somehow defuses the tension instead of the opposite. But if you haven't seen the original I'd say see this first and then watch the old one and see what you think.<br /><br />The blu-ray is a good transfer and there are some decent extras, and Colin's commitment to the role is pretty clearly highlighted. He's the one who makes this work, when it does.<br /><br />It's a nice slick sci-fi thriller, so if you like those you'll like this, and it's always fun to watch Cranston as a bad guy in any case. I think this version of TR will age pretty well, mainly because Farrell is such a likable lead in most everything he does. He gives it his all here, and it's that and his chemistry with the ever-beguiling Kate B that makes this a good recall.<br /><br />But what's wrong with a few more laughs now and then?
0345803485|5.0|I am loving my book, it came before time and it was in excellent condition.....Great read I have been wanting this book for awhile now
B009MF56GC|3.0|2.7 stars<br /><br />Less fun than I expected. Stallone seems to get worse as an actor with every movie, and his only good move here is giving Statham a lot of screen time. He adds some humor to a weak plot and weaker script, and no amount of stars can rescue the hammy dialogue.<br /><br />Lots of shooting etc but somehow the action left me flat, and after this was over it felt like cotton candy, no substance at all and barely a memory.<br /><br />With so many good action flicks made in the past few years, this one is truly expendable.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Funny, sweet movie which really speaks to the limited audience of mid-life couples.  a younger generation wouldn't get it, and singles would find it sappy or boring, but it worked for me.
B005LAII1C|4.0|If you don't like Family Guy you won't like this. But if you do like Seth's no boundaries style of humor, you'll find plenty to laugh at.<br /><br />Wahlberg and Kunis are both good enough, but it's Ted and his lines that make this work when it does, which is at least half the time. It could have gotten far more mawkish than it did, but SM cut it pretty tight and shows a good feel for the big screen. There's cheese but it's usually very self-aware, which makes it quite funny.<br /><br />Some scenes were pointless to me, like the model dumpage, but hey, if something here doesn't offend you then you are well nigh unoffendable, and more power to you!<br /><br />The blu-ray has some nice extras, including a good gag reel and making of, and I like that the effects are used solely to make the bear come to pretty believable life. That and the constant swipes at Hollywood fakeness, romcom and other film tropes tropes and the vapidity of our modern consumer culture make this not just crude but also very smart in its own way.<br /><br />Something tells me MacFarlane is just getting started. Can't wait to see who he gets in his crosshairs next...
0671027344|4.0|This book is a pretty decent read. It's light, but still immersive. It doesn't have a strange twist or over-the-top conclusion. It satisfies at a basic level to a very high standard.
B004H0M8EA|3.0|Only 10 % complete at this time. It is starting to hold my interest. This is a book club selection.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like these G5 games.  Something creepy about carnies.....makes this game eerily funtastic.  The graphics and sound are good.  Try it....you'll buy it.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I had read the first 2 books because a friend told me that this was a great read. I thought that there might be something more in the series. I might have known that if there wasn't any substance in the first 2 books that there wouldn't be any in this one. It was elementary in content and the writing was poor. I skipped so much of the book as it was redundant to the 2 other books.
0439023521|5.0|If your into survivor scenarios, you'll love this book. The book is well written in first person, the author does not drop the ball in that regard. It also allows one a glimpse of how a new world order may look in the wrong hands of a dictator.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a very good book. The reader will be surprised at the goings on at the White House. I recommend  this book.
0307473473|5.0|Well written, great story and I loved the female character, she is awesome,. I love her intelligence, the way she plans, bides her time and takes care of matters.
0061438294|4.0|I'm glad I bought this book, I plan on keeping it handy as a good reference book!  I've recommended it to several friends as well.
B002UEW31I|5.0|Brad Pitt was great in this movie, and the co-stars just as good. The story well paced and fun to watch. I liked the fictional WWII tale.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|If you havent seen Brave already you have to see this!! It an excellent movie. Very entertaining the kids or adults will love it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a great read. It's so honest and realistic. Trying to find yourself and figure out where you belong can be quite challenging.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|It &#34;zooms&#34; in for sure, but it's kind of like a fisheye lens. Trying to have 2 people using it is close to impossible.
0143122061|4.0|The book was required reading in a community class on Foreign Policiy.. The requirement of total number of words for a review is nonsense.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This movie has great action scenes and keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time. This is definitely a must have for any batman or action movie fan.
0981951252|4.0|persistence and diligence.  This book didn't use those words, but goes back to understanding that persistent character, like the tortoise, wins the race.
0345803485|3.0|This is an OK book for its type, but Michele St. John wrote \\"Fantasy Line\\" over 20 years ago and it's a much better book, in the same genre.  It was published by Blue Moon books, but I heard it was re-published about 5-7 years ago. If you can find it, you are in for a treat!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Big bang is awesome.I love this show. I really hope Leonard and penny get married. And I hope Any get what she wants.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Use this app and it works great recommend this for everyone who wants to have a good idea on how much battery they are using on there device.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great. Cant wait to read the other 2 books in this series. I still haven't seen the movie yet though so we will see how it compares to the book.
B00683JK9K|4.0|A little hard to move the pieces but still fun. Once the pieces move, it is a challenge to play.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Hi all,<br /><br />I read this book in a number of hours, it was definately too short but then I dont see that as a bad thing. I hated putting the book down as although this seems at the start to be a twist on an old tale it was still gripping. The background was light and the story seemed to rush through the markers giving mainly surface information. However this could be intentional to provide us with ebnough scope and background of this new faraway magical place so that when book 2 and further releases come out we can getting into some real depth as the foundation has already been laid. The author seemed to want to get us as quickly as possible to this level without taking us on a tediuos character building discovery probably in the expectation of filling us in later.<br /><br />Overall I found the book entertaining and great value for the money at this reduced proce. Definately looking forward to the next book and seeing where we will be taken next.<br /><br />Thanks Morgan,<br /><br />Mr C
0525951652|5.0|I wish this had been required reading when I was in school.  It does a great job of explaining the causes for WWII, and the mindset of the people of the time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hooked on the first one and this one is just as great!! Great way to escape from reality for a bit!!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Great movie!  True to the comic book story line and characters.  I was happily surprised with the acting and overall production, well acted and directed.<br /><br />Hoping there will be second movie.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|A good movie. Bad Ass Movie. Story line moves along well. Characters were believable & had enough depth. Moonshiners kick ass.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An intriguing story that keeps you guessing around every bend.  The characters are complex but still relatable.  Katniss is an amazing girl with super-human abilities.  I can't wait to read the next installment!
B00AYQNOLW|5.0|In the same vein as Baraka (which is my favorite movie) -- awesome photography and mind-blowing depths of meaning.<br /><br />The scene with French actor Olivier de Sagazan gave me goosebumps all over.<br /><br />IMO, everyone should watch both Baraka and Samsara. :)
B0013YPEMG|4.0|I love Jack and Keeton impresses me as the best Bruce Wayne of any of the Batmans.  After watching the more recent Dark Knights, this does come off a bit dated and cartoony, but again, it's a classic and kicked off the interest in creating such a long-lived franchise...
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I've read several of De Milles's  novels and so foaar this is by far the most boring, don't know whether I will finish it or give up.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|seen all the classic movies of this tale.I wanted to see how accurate the movies were.Happy to say they were spot on.Very good read
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great more than one game just to play my nephew loves this app he plays every time he comes over
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I had no experience with Tintin until this movie and found it simple, wholesome, and enjoyable. It was a great \\"lay back and unwind\\" movie for me and I was very happy to find it \\"family-friendly\\" but not childish.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I AM AN AVID SCIENCE FICTION BUFF.  THIS IS A TRUE 1950'S SCI FI CLASSIC.  THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE ALSO.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I had not read the book, but knew that it was about gaming.  I really enjoyed the story,  It was really better than I anticipated.  I will watch it more than once.
0307730697|5.0|Here's a lost soul that needed direction in the worst possible way and he found it be becoming a SEAL. Normally that would be the end of the story but the depths from where Adam came from to excel to DEVGRU is truly an inspiration. God bless men like Adam.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've been looking for a book like this since Twilight, a book that will keep your heart pounding throught the story. This is the kind of book you'll be up until 3 am reading. And I thought this would be just another High School romance, I couldn't be more wrong.<br />I love Colleen Hoover style of writing, you really feel like you're in the story, you feel everything Sky is feeling. And man, oh man! What an emotional roller coster ride! You laugh, you cry, you gasp, and you cry some more. And just when you think you have everything figured out, there's a flip to the story that you never saw coming.<br />And for the people that are saying that the second half wasn't as good, I couldn't disagree more. The story evolved, changed, the characters matured, and that's what makes the story so good. I was on the edge of my seat reading the second half of the book.<br />And OH MY GOSH!! Holder? Where can I find one like that?<br />This book set the bar for all the other romance novels I read from now on!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am so happy that I read the books before the movie came out. There is so much description that you do not get when you watch the movies. You can totally put yourself in the heros' shoes. I flew through the books, easy light reads that really get you thinking about the real world as well. Not just a fantasy book, but a eye opener too.
B004I744AS|5.0|Every other dictionary I've tried never gave me the full meaning or  charges to much for very little in return .I really enjoy using this dictionary.(:
B000JQUMPI|3.0|I remember watching the movie when I was younger, and had the movie in my head the whole time I was reading... waiting for all the climaxes of the book. I think that is why I rated okay instead of one star higher. The older language does make it a little longer of a read, not as easy to just read through. A great moral story, especially when you are or have gone through those moments in your own life. There is a little of everything for every girl/woman. Not a page turner, but definately lightens the heart.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a must read book. Makes you want to keep reading. Buy this today and you won't be mad
B0067AC5KA|2.0|Maybe I had heard so many great things, that my expectations were too high. There was way too much explanations, descriptions, and fillers that I felt I could have just skimmed most of the book. I felt that I had to read the remaining 2 books because I bought the trilogy. The characters were good, the story was good, but it just felt like the story dragged most of the time.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Vintage Clancy. Problem now is that we have beaten the Chinese twice, an the Arabs are too easy a target. The book starts off quickly, and never lets up. Can't wait until the next one.
B00002N9ER|4.0|Initially purchased one to try it out. Since then I bought 3 more. Nice to know where a flashlight is when you need it. Made of plastic, but quality seems ok.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved this book just as much (if not more) than the first one in the series! Of coarse I am left in suspense, and I cannot wait to begin reading Beautiful Chaos.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use pinterest everyday my daughter calls me a pinterest horder so many great ideas and projects to use and share with your friends.  Its a wonderful app.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is so entertaining.  I just don't want to stop playing it. I have to keep charging my kindle.  I have never been so hook on a game before.  Even my husband has been playing it.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|My husband uses it all the time.  can answer anything you want to know about.  would recomend this to everyone
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I loveddd it! It was so freakin good and he is my idol. I look up ti him so much!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this series!  This book got me further into the mortal arts series. It was another good one. I read through the entire series in two weeks
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Excellent read, enjoyed every minute of it ! \\" The Lucky One\\" i enjoyable as the other Sparks books .
B008X9Z37A|5.0|whats not to like, it well lit easy to read, im still learning compared to my nook this is a lot better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it, could not stop reading, when I was finishing the first one was going out too buy the second one, couldn't find the second book, so I had too drive too three different stores too find it, went ahead and bought the final one too. Read them all in two days couldn't sleep until I did. Now I have too read a little bit of the books everyday.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|A great book to understand the reasoning behind the difficulties we face in marriage or a relationship.  Some people do not recognize the cause of the difficulty.  Others do and tend to ignore them.  This is an upfront explanation of how we react to other peoples actions, namely our spouses or significant other, or choice not to react.  A good read!
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Movie is. Great (even if not totally accurate) but why doesn't amazon sell a digital copy except ultraviolet?  I don't want the disk. Am I going to ave to go to iTunes?
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It's written in the form of letter to someone who remains anonymous throughout the book. I thought it was good but I haven't seen seen the movie so I can't compare the two.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector is the latest saga of Jack Ryan and his Son (Jack Jr.) as the US faces both cyber and kinetic threats from across the globe. The technical details are a little less precise than those seen in earlier Jack Ryan novels as the subjects, methods, and threats continue to evolve from hard physical assets (Planes, Ships, Missiles ) to softer, but equally lethal cyber threats. None the less, Tom Clancy and his team have done a great job of evolving the story line with the threat profile to keep pace.<br /><br />A fun read that you won't be able to put down until you've finished it.
B00866JL96|5.0|Loved the movie, although the book was better.  Zac is such a cutie :), if you like Nicholas Sparks books/movies then you will enjoy this 1 too.
B004Y042N8|4.0|i used to have the ad-supported version of this game and it's pretty fun. i don't know why people are saying it has no sound though. it totally has sound effects. not that they're very good or anything. i hate the &quot;aaaaah!&quot; scream it makes when you fail, as well as the trumpet fanfare noise it makes when you complete a puzzle. the clicking noise it makes as you connect the dots is ok though. anyway it's not bad for a FAOTD, but i got it before i saw the regular price so i can't say if it's worth your money or not. i think if i had to pay, i'd just stick with the free version until i got bored, and then i'd delete it and be on my merry.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|U can not go wrong with this movie!!!! I mean u have hot guys showing off their moves and bodies!!!! LOVED it in theatres and best of all I can watch it at home anytime!!!
B0036FOGTW|4.0|This is a must read for all working in Africa and dealing with foreign aid.  Dambisa is direct at to the point.
B009KNPM9W|3.0|Today's movie soundtracks are nothing like the classic soundtracks of lets say, Henry Mancini or Bernard Herman.<br />They're not even as good as the late 50's or 60's soundtracks that had a memorable main theme song sung<br />by lets say Johnny Mathis or Tony Bennett, that re-appeared in the movie in various plush inst versions.<br />the music coincided with the action and the emotion of the story.<br />Today's soundtracks contain a mish mash montage of Hip-Hop trash, rehashed old school tunes<br />that have nothing to do with the action or emotional connection of the movies theme.<br />Issac Hayes Shaft and Curtis Mayfield's Superfly were the first movies to use popular music<br />into a movie and maintian a theme through out that moved along with the story and gave the movie<br />life. Thoses soundtracks were all relevant to the movie. Curtis Mayfeild's soundtracks were perfect<br />as far as being relevant to the movies theme.They  also had numerous tracks that were worthy<br />of being hit singles.<br />In that light, Marvin's&#34; Trouble Man' is more like the traditional movie soundtrack of the 60's.<br />Trouble Man, the main theme and song was the only commercial single from the soundtrack.<br />The rest of the lp is variations of that song in inst form done in short snippets and short symphonic<br />themes.  If you're into listening to classic  movie soundtracks this is for you. If you want to hear MG<br />sing on a few tracks I'd say skip it as he only teases you, with background snippets on most of<br />the bonus cuts. The one saving grace though is the alt versions of Trouble man, they are<br />disticly different mixes, so if you are a die hard MG fan who simply must have every experiment<br />that he toyed with, then I'd say that this is a worthy collectable, but if you were hoping for some<br />additional vocal tunes not heard before, then I'd say you won't find it here. There's just not<br />that much.
B006LSZECO|3.0|For the first 99% of the book, I give it 4 stars. For the ending, I give it 1 star. I loved how creative this book was and how it played with my emotions. Just as soon as I gave up on a character, I was rooting for them... then I hated them again... then I was rooting for them again. A roller coaster of emotions. As powerful as this book was, I was blown away at how bad the ending was. I felt that the author just got tired and gave up. I initially thought my Kindle had lost some pages at the end because of an electronic glitch. But no.
1891252089|5.0|Awesome book for any level of yoga instruction or practice. Easy to follow and nice and small to carry around with you.
B007ZZKWHY|4.0|The computer animation is beautiful, and impressively makes this small budget movie look great. A little of the movie is slow but the premise is so funny and the acting so good that the movie conquers this failing and stands triumphant over other movies like an iron condor.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|It's very simple but quick to get to and follow. It does have some of the same exercises but i like that it has voice assistance.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I actually enjoyed this one... I wasn't impressed with The Hunger Games but I thought I might as well dredge on. I am looking forward to reading that the all the Capital's goons have been relieved of their life's Blood. I am torn between Peeta and Gale but I am pretty sure that was her intention.
B007SGM084|4.0|Interesting captivating and fun to read. This is not for the sexually shy reader,then again maybe it is. This book will enlighten its readers.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|&quot;Enigmatis&quot; was a great game to play. Nice graphics, good story and great puzzles. Big Fish Games always delivers high quality gaming experiences no matter what the format.
B007MDB548|5.0|Like the rest of the Tinker Bell movies, this one is just as cute. My daughter loves it and has watched it many times.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I have to give Quentin Tarantino credit.  He not only directs great movies but he writes them as well.  This may be my favorite of his, which is saying a lot.  All of his work has a great deal of blood and violence in it so I assume anyone considering watching his work goes into it knowing this fact.  If you don't know that, then that is the only reason why you may not want to see this.  However, this film has so much more going on in it than blood and violence, that it will be a loss to miss it. And really, how could you make a movie about one of the most cruel and violent practices, slavery, without using a lot of blood and violence in turn?<br /><br />One thing which will astound you is that there is a great deal of humor in this as well.  I almost bust a gut when the KKK riders discover that one of their riders' wives made the hoods wrong.  They can barely see through the hoods as they ride! That scene could have been straight out of Mel Brooks's BLAZING SADDLES.<br /><br />The acting talent here is also just astonishing.  There are so many great performances and they just keep coming. So let me mention the top one right off the bat.  That is none other than Samuel L. Jackson playing the complete Uncle Tom to his master, Mr. Candy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.  The only way I finally identified Jackson was through his voice as physically he is unrecognizable. He is the stooped over, grouchy, servile major domo to his lord and master.  DiCaprio, who has been a heartthrob for the ladies for years, must have loved playing the villainous slave owner and master.  Although he has tackled unheroic parts in the past, this is the first time he has been an out and out villain of the film.  He is ably supported by Walter Goggin of JUSTIFIED and THE SHIELD who is more used to playing the bad guy.<br /><br />Christoph Waltz plays the bounty hunter who takes Jamie Foxx, Django, on as his partner in bounty hunting.  After they've made a great deal of money, they proceed to try to get Django's wife back.  She is currently owned by Candy (DiCaprio). Both Waltz and Foxx are excellent and Waltz is up for another supporting Oscar.  He previously won the supporting Oscar for Tarantino's movie before this one. I'm frankly surprised Jackson is not up for the supporting Oscar.<br /><br />I've seen both this and LINCOLN and would have a hard time picking best film, director, etc., from these two in competition.  However, as lead actor, I believe Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln still remains unbeatable.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a favorite of my grandson Nathan...he loves this game and loves to borrow gmas kindle to play it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down from the beginning! The first night I stayed up till 3 am excited to find out what was going to happen next.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|Brad Paisley is so talented: awesome voice and drop dead gorgeous too! And this CD has it all: great tunes with a variety of themes.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My daughter downloaded it for her kindle. She is really enjoying it. She wanted me to write this review. lol
0545265355|5.0|Good quality.  Was a gift to my daughter and she loved them.  Just don't compare to the movie as they always take a little artistic license.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book was great. Do not miss reading it if you liked the previous Jack Ryan thrillers.  I only felt like it slowed down once and that didn't last long. I don't like to put story info in my reviews because I would rather you read it without me putting details before you. It is a great book and worth the time and money.
B001RLP862|3.0|The cards are very durable and I love the box they come in, but they are hard as heck to pick up when they are dealt to you.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|doesn't fit kindle fire hd. great case! really disappointed that it didn't work...still looking for replace that I like as much
B001DSNEJM|4.0|The case was in great shape.  Looked new except for no plastic shrink wrap around it. (Which was not promised)  I am very happy with my purchase!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is very much in the classic adventure game genre, like the old Kings Quest games.  The puzzles range from pretty easy to a bit challenging, but they aren't impossible.  There is a hint section within the game that will push you in the right direction if you're stuck.  The puzzle aspect of games is the most interesting to me and I'm indifferent to graphics for the most part, but the graphics here were pretty good.  There was no hidden object aspect to this game, which I appreciate, and no annoying arcade sequences.  I will most certainly buy more games by this developer. Good games like this one are few and far between.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started out using this on my pc but after some time I began to get rather fond of this app so now I use it on my kindle! It's very useful I recommend it.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|I do not really hate it, it just didn't fit. Otherwise the fabric was nice, the design pleasant enough. okay?

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This isn't exactly a Heinlein Boy's Life book but it's the kind of book he might have written for Discovery.  Science and adventure for adults with a positive message without gratuitous sex or violence.<br /><br />Note there is no blonde, no gun, no fighting machine, no spaceship on the cover.  I'd use the word &#34;up lifting&#34; but that would be the kiss of death!
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It was terrible there was no real point  I wouldn't suggest it to a single person<br /> So I won't even waste my time
B001FB55YE|3.0|Got here quickly, solid movie and I was happy with the way it was packaged and handled overall. Could have been quicker.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is an amazing novel that will definitely  impact your life and change your viewing of so many things. As Clay listens to the tapes left behind from Hannah, his crush, after her suicide he feels a stronger connection between Hannah and wishes she could have opened up to him so that she wouldn't have decided to end her life and he would have possibly had a chance with her
B0095G5AFU|4.0|This is organized and easy to use.  You cant use your finger of a stylus, but can use the typing feature...For that it is fantastic...great app...
6305428352|5.0|Richard Dreyfuss has done some great work in his career, but in my experience ... this is one of my favorites and one of his best.  \\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\" chronicle's the professional life of a composure turned music teacher.  It's a touching and convincing story of love, challenges and living life to the fullest.<br /><br />Not to be missed and one of those movies that will become a classic.  I have watched it probably dozens of times and it never gets old for me.  I was gifted the film for Christmas (I wish they had a Blu-ray version) and it will become a part of my library of favorites.<br /><br />A touching story very well executed.
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|I will start out to say that this app did not have any problems or glitches or anything.  I was just plain to hard for me to figure out.  It has many pages and backgrounds and I did really want to learn how to use it, just could not do it.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Surprisingly accurate for my rural area. Easy to use. Haven't seen the results of long-term forecasts.  Better than the &#34;local&#34; weather guesscasts.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Cannot imagine my Android phone without SwiftKey. I highly recommend it! Its voice recognition is stunningly accurate. It quickly learned my typing style and makes very accuratre predictions making it where an old guy can message as fast as his twenty year old daughter! Thanks SwiftKey!

B0050PYNO4|5.0|PROBABLY MY FAVORITE COMEDY. E.T. CANNOT TOP PAUL. NOT A GOD FEARING MAN SO THIS MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT, TO BAD THE LATE GEORGE CARL R.I.P. WAS NOT AROUND TO BE IN THIS FILM.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I really enjoyed this thriller and it had so many twist and turns that it kept you on edge which is good for a thriller.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|fantastic movies first of all. FILMS THE ENTIRE FAMILY CAN WATCH TOGETHER OR ALONE. FUNNY, ACTION ,SCI-FI, AND ALWAYS AS WAS THE CASE WITH THE CARTOON A GREAT LESSON TO BE LEARNED.
B0024RID6U|5.0|This is my favorite album by the Rolling Stones.  Not a bad song on the whole album.<br />The remastered cd sounds much better than the old one.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a great app! My 3 year old absolutely loves it! However, he has been wanting the Dr. Doofenshmirtz bonus level since they started advertising for it on Disney Channel, and I keep getting an error message when I try to purchase it. Please fix this!!!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I love this movie! It was cheaper than in stores, and it works very well. I would highly recommend it.
B00003CXBK|4.0|Arrived on time and in good quailty as it mentioned in the production on the webside. We love the moive.
B001HN694K|4.0|I bought this movie as a present, and it was a great price. It works great and I highly recommend it
B000002GYW|5.0|I have always considered Desperado the eagles best work. It has a flow that makes you keep listening.  Sadly they faded into a singles band intent on cool over content.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I loved this movie! It had awesome, classic songs. The actors and actresses were great, and they really made the rock and roll era come back to life. I can not stop listening to the soundtrack!

This is what i have been looking for. I have tryed the free apps and not one of them worked or i it took too much to setup. This was easy and fast setup. i highly recomend it if you a looking for an app to print documents, photos or contacts from your kindle fire hd 8.9
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|i as waiting on the third season. when will it be available? the first and second season were fantastic. cant wait.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|captivating and entertaining draws u in and leaves u wanting more. My son is 28 and told us about the show and the wife and i both love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved Colleen Hoover after reading the Slammed series, well, she topped those two books with this book! My husband was even curious about the book because I stayed up so late reading it!<br /><br />I started reading it thinking it was another teen romance, and why do others keep writing about teens. But, I am a sucker for that Edward/Bella and Christian/Anastasia love. The love that is so deep it hurts. So I kept reading.....then wow! This book took twists and turns! The subject matter was unfortunate, but how it ended was amazing. And, the fact that Holder literally stood by Sky's side through what was probably the worst events in her adult life was incredible. He was so unselfish during the events that played out. That is the kind of love that is so deep it hurts. I definetly recommend this book if you love a good love story, and you can get past the fact that they are only 17 and 18. I am definetly looking forward to more books by Colleen!
B005721W9O|5.0|Love this movie...Unique and cleverly written. Funny and witty ironick humor, you can actually watch this with the whole family.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Another amazing book by George RR Martin in the Song of Ice and Fire series. This book definately continues the story at the same pace and standard as Martin's earlier books. I can't wait for another one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a definite read, it has all you need to keep glued to your book. This was one of my favorite books of all time!
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I would suggest that you should go and contemplate your bellybutton for a more rewarding experience. This movie is bad.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a definite read, it has all you need to keep glued to your book. This was one of my favorite books of all time!
B002CKCUOA|5.0|I bought this album in 1983 in the US (on cassette, no less), and I don't think I  had ever even heard the original mixes of the tracks remixed by Kershenbaum for the US release. I had always thought the first album sounded better sonically. However, this reissue puts that to bed--the original mixes of the Rio, My Own Way, etc., are fantastic, and the mastering is perfect (i.e., it sounds transparent to me). Together with the high-quality packaging, this release is well worth the money if you love this album. The inclusion of the Kershenbaum remixes on the \\"bonus\\" EP is great for the nerd in you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a definite read, it has all you need to keep glued to your book. This was one of my favorite books of all time!
034580404X|5.0|I was so pleased with the order , quality and condition of my order. More than I really expected without actually seeing this for myself. Thank you so much. Will order again when I am ready again. Makes for great gift quality items.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a definite read, it has all you need to keep glued to your book. This was one of my favorite books of all time!
B005IQZB14|2.0|Not as expected. I was disappointed- more in her lifestyle. Cant believe anyone would attempt a hike like that with NO experience
0307943259|5.0|There are many twists and turns of plot, plus interesting characters and tension at the later parts. Legal issues included.
B007M45PMU|5.0|No regrets on this buy. I have definitely enjoyed this album start to finish. Favourite songs include Deadsea, Submarines, and Flowers In Your Hair.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|I dropped mine and the frame immediately broke.  The first one i had seemed to hold up much better.<br /><br />  Wouldn't buy one again.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is fantastic! I use it wherever I go! I forgot my alarm clock at home when I went away to college. So for kicks and giggles I looked up alarm clock apps and found this! I really love the nightstand mode. Genius !!!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Seriously who doesn't love this movie?? It's also free on Netflix now, so if you have that don't bother renting.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Works fine for me. Lots of different stations. I don't understand why people think their phone and every app is out to get them. Read the reviews on Google Play.
B0096PYUE2|3.0|My phone needed some kind of a flash player.  Still trying to figure out how to get this to work so that videos I get on email and such automatically play on this.  Not sure if this is what I really needed.
B000WFBC6E|1.0|To start off the new year, I thought this clock with the iconic Swiss design would be a worthwhile buy. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed.  It arrived at the expected delivery date; nothing to complain there. To my surprise, when I opened the box and took out the clock, I noticed that the second hand was not attached.  I was not happy.  A clock for its price should have better quality. From afar, it looked high quality. But with close inspection it was decent, not exceptional.  I would not recommend this product. It is not worth the price: you are paying for the name.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is ok for a phone game.  I enjoyed it for a while, but always seem to drop back to my swipe games.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|firstly, thanks amazon for a app that takes u a step higher for phone/tablet users. now, in my experience with tablets, say about 7 in past year, i could never SHARE on facebook, you could post status updates/comment, but not share things. this app lets you do that !! I had no problems moving around, doing my bussiness with facbook, in fact, this app made it better. better yet, a free app that gave me no problems. enjoy.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|This was an exciting movie that also included the traditional theme of good winning over evil (Autobots winning over Decepticons).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Gods word is useful in any form but this app makes reading the Bible anywhere convenient. The offering of sharing a verse a day is great

B007DA2FHG|5.0|THE KIDS WILL LOVE THIS ONE AND ADULTS ALIKE ... GREAT STORY LINE AND EMOTIONALLY CHARGED ... THIS A TTACHMENT IS BETTER THAN I HAD WITH MY WIFE.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Jodi Picoult rarely disappoints me.  I loved learning about music therapy.  It was a new concept for me.  The book was an easy read and enjoyable.
B00A50PE6K|3.0|I just wasn't as impressed with this 3rd volume as I was with the first two.  My favorite song on there was the Hannukah one, and I'm not even Jewish!  The rest of the songs were just kind of lackluster.  I also didn't like that it was released so late in the season.
1936608898|5.0|Buy this book, follow the plan, change your life...it's that simple.  Highly attainable lifestyle changes that WILL make a difference in how you feel and look.
0525952926|5.0|Just finished the first book of the Trilogy, and had to hurry and order this one!  Wonderful epic novel!  A large, yet diverse, group of characters to keep track of, but they all tie in together nicely so that it isn't too confusing!  Highly recommend -- a great read!
B00008BXJG|5.0|Great CD.  Got here quicker than anticipated, exactly as described!  This CD will always be a classic & I'm happy with the purchase
0807126063|5.0|Knowing the history of Toole brings a sense of understanding to his characters.  A book for the ages, not because of his death and publishing efforts by LSU, but for the clarity of his perception, your senses will smell, taste, hear and feel life in New Orleans.
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|This film wanders through the hill country during prohibition.  What should be prohibited<br />is making movies that look like they have a possibility and then never deliver.  Don't drink<br />this moonshine, it will make you go blind!
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I love the case as well as keeping the screen of my kindle from getting scratched. The cover converting to a stand is great for watching movies on the plane.  The price is in the moderate to high range but worth the price.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I eagerly awaited the latest Harry Bosch and the book did not disappoint me.  Harry is like an old friend, but Connelly has continued to evolve his character, so he doesn't get boring.  The book had an interesting plot line and Connelly held the suspense well.  This book is a good read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|What a great game. I enjoyed playing this one! Hope there is a sequel to this game as you are left wondering what will happen.I'd definitely purchase it!
1934030597|5.0|My husband asked me to order this for him. He has read most of it within a short period of time and he will use it as a reference book for years to come I am sure.
B004DM0UII|5.0|But I live with this app on. I don't know about its strength or incompatibilities, all I know is that I leave it on almost all the time. I love it.
B008BGNMZU|2.0|None of the selections were inspiring.  This surprised me, given that these outstanding musicians seem to never take a day off  when it comes to producing uplifting pieces on a regular basis.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Lawless. Great historical mood scenery clothing etc. Well acted. Superb casting. Much Violence but appropriate to the times.  Enjoyed it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I did not want to put the book down from start to finish. There are great reminders and lessons about real and unselfish love.
B00628SJJS|5.0|WOW!  A FANTASTIC MOVIE!  I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  The acting is superb.  I would recommend this as a &#34;must-see&#34; movie!
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|If u are into the resident evil movies then u will like this movie.  I liked the simulators they used to recreate the outbreaks. I thought that was something the game would do. Although not enough zombies. U cb never gave enough zombies.  Unless its world war Z.  They got too many.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book was tedious.  It was my book club's January choice so I &#34;pushed&#34; myself to complete it.  Would never recommend it.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Great source for the beginning aquaponics gardener. Packed full of practical info, illustrations, and the how's and why's the aquaponics system really works physically, as well as the biology behind it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book gets you hooked. Once you pick it up you will not want to put it down. I couldn't wait to see what happened next.
0345803507|5.0|I loved all three books of the Fifty Shades.  I heard so many good, but also so many bad reviews of the books so I just took a chance and ordered the first book.  Now, three books later, I am waiting for the movie premier.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The most entertaining movies I have ever watched.<br />A must see for anyone twelve and older.<br />I wish there were eight more books and films.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a good book and so well written! I can't wait to see what else the trilogy has to offer.
0143119680|5.0|It's my latest guilty pleasure. It's a little bit Dan Brown, a little along the ilk of Twilight, except the main character is in her thirties. It's quite a page turner! And it makes you want to enjoy a spot of tea and toast. :) I highly recommend cozying up to it on a rainy weekend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this! By far the best book of the series. You just find  yourself putting everything else to the side until you've finished. You can't put it down.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|(No spoilers:) Rotten tomatoes gave this movie a great review and said that it was an uplifting romantic comedy/musical, but I disagree. It's got a lot of songs in it, but it's not anywhere near a Rodgers & Hammerstein musical, and it doesn't feel like Broadway. It feels a lot darker and grittier than the reviews led me to expect.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|I love the the first two MIB movies, they were great! Full of of lots of action and very good storylines. This, however, wasn't all that good. I thought the storyline was blah! Had some low budget looking monters and was just kinda of boring.
B00001W9G0|3.0|This movie was kind of a downer for me.  I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't.  Also, I was hoping for more than just one song by Barbara.  Wouldn't recommend it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I've loved every Ice Age movie they've ever come out with. And this one just adds to the fun. I loved the the famous little skit tha Scrat does in the beginning, he never dissappoints! They should make a movie with Scrat as the lead character, it'd be hilarious! Ice age Continental Drift continues the family fun with all the origianl characters and more.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Heart-breaking story of orphanage life and the scars it left on these children, with an uplifting ending. I enjoyed every chapter,hard to put this one down! Read this book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down. I read in within 4 days which is very fast for me.<br />I can not wait to read the next one.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|action packed so if you liek that you will like this.  The team is so good together. Great rental movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed the love story. I didn't want it to end!<br />Characters were very well displayed , I felt as if I was living it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A very emotional book. I found I could identify with the feelings of each character and even shed a tear or two.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I wish this book could be a movie. I recommend this book to people who have alot of extra time because i could not put it down.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fishdom is a great game.  Everytime I pick up the Kindle, I play Fishdom before reading my books.  It is a bit addictive.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book in 2 days. I couldn't put it down. Definitely a good book if you're up for sone gore.
145210655X|5.0|This book is a great book to give fathers who love their sons.  Darth Vader, the most evil man in the universe, has Luke Skywalker, his son, to take care of.  Luke is the typical little boy and Darth is the loving father.  Such a new and inventive theme.  Something unlike any other book you have seen.  Each page is a small cartoon (think Far Side style) showing the adorable little Luke and the evil Darth Vader acting fatherly which is so out of character.  So cute and so funny. I highly recommend this for fathers day or anytime you want to give a fun light laughter gift.<br /><br />Everyone knows, when a 3 year old hands you a toy phone, you answer it.  Even if you are the most evil dark knight in the universe!
B000FC146C|5.0|i loved it - could not put  it down. colleen made me feel the emotions of everyone in her book.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|If you care about the quality of your food, if you care about animals, if you care about global warming, if you care about hunger in the world. You should read this book. Eye-opening,
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids and I spent hours Christmas vacation playing this. We loved it. My 6 yr old would get  so excited that he could figure it out and unlock a new level with out me. Really makes you think.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very good app! I would recommend this battery app to anyone who wants to know how much power is left for web, reading, watching movies etc.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It is cute but to hard for my 4 yr old to play. I didn't get very far in the game before I removed from my kindle fire. I would suggest it for older girls.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I bought this album less than a week ago and I am flippin' thrilled about it.<br /><br />Musically and psychologically, Billy takes me on a journey with this one...From the subtle intro building through introductory riff and power chord to blissful pounding drums and the classic Corgan vocals, he blasts off with the adrenaline-inducing \\"Quasar\\" and, once in the stratosphere, I continue accelleration with the thrusters of heavily drummed \\"Panopticon,\\" which reminds us to trust in our metaphorical \\"rocket\\" to get us safely out of the grasp of gravity into space and beyond.  I then for a moment look woefully back on earthbound life with \\"The Celestials.\\"  This is a fleeting sadness, as I am soon looking forward again as I enter the weightlessness of \\"Violet Rays,\\" which carries me effortlessly into thoughts of invincibility in the creator's arms as expressed in \\"My Love is Winter,\\" which carries a U-2-ish guitar backdrop until the latter 1/3 of the song which presents a classic SP riff and solo, and the track boasts a catchy chorus with good power behind it.<br /><br />I feel a common ground being reached in synthesizer-driven \\"One Diamond, One Heart,\\" between all of mankind, each one of us as sparkles of a diamond together as one heart.  We are one, working together to get us past humankind's current fall line, as we build up against the metaphorical mountains of the unknown space outside our Earth.  We are, as Billy puts it, \\"Always on your side,\\" working as one.  Fun has its place in life also...as is expressed in another rather heavily synthesized yet playful \\"Pinwheels,\\" where I can get lost in the present with the song's electronic intro and spin into its affectious riff, before becalming while taking a breath to blow again to spin the pinwheel of thought into any direction, mesmerized, as I spin further into space...<br /><br />And then musical darkness illustrates ensuing trepidation as we discover \\"Oceania\\" on the horizon, named after our beloved South PacificIslands of home Earth, \\"lovers might reach you\\" Billy sings as we approach, and \\"so alone, so alone\\" as we come to these alien shores...to come face to face with...Other beings?  The creator?  Self-awareness?  Within the song we change pace with this occurence, this discovery, as we process it as \\"face to face we breath,\\" and our hearts pound like the drums that lead us out of the song.  With this new discovery, our history is quesioned in \\"Pale Horse,\\" as religion shatters and dogmas collapse, using thorazine as a metaphore for eradicating such faith-based thoughts, and realize there is no birth or death, beginning or end (heaven/hell), just a continuance.  The pale horse of religion'a Apocalypse somewhat regrettably runs away as the heavy war drum ends.<br /><br />An energetic and wonderfully riffed \\"Chimera\\" seems to bring evolution to the front of thought, perhaps connecting all of earth's histories and fairytales to the real world present and suggesting we move forward and \\"whistle past the lane,...show me your life,\\" as if to ask to continue to show what we are capable of without dependence on faith or fantasy as we know it but rather with, by and for our own motivations--\\"All you need is you, lover, all you need is you.\\"  Don't be afraid to make mistakes, it's not a sin but rather \\"If I'm wrong I'm right\\"--we learn from our mistakes and move on!  Time will continue and the energy moves on as \\"Glissandra\\" remarks, \\"children cry out loud as embers blast my heart, broken where I stop.\\" The riff is catchy, uplifting.  The drums move me.  Energy being passed on...<br /><br />And as we individually continue through our journeys in a classic, heavily guitared \\"Inkless\\", we are reminded that we are the stars, perpetual...when a star collapses, it explodes in light and sends its energies outward to become part of the rest.  \\"The stars are out,\\" Billy says.  As if perhaps to say the light of stars have gone out perhaps...to soon explode in supernova, sending particalsout into space, \\"Wasted along the way to reach you,\\" as he suggests in \\"Wildflower,\\" the albums final, cooldown track.  Everything goes on in one way or another, no start and no finish, but continuance.  No end place such as Heaven or Hell, no reason to believe there is ever an end to our energies.  Life that has ended has become energy to feed other life, such as the \\"Wildflower in the wilderness outside.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried, this is simply where I've been taken with this truly beautiful and immaculately arranged album.  Billy's back on his rocket and though the Smashing Pumpkins will never be the same as they were as a unit in the 90's with D'Arcy and James and Michael, Billy has always been the mastermind and his brilliance shows in \\"Oceania.\\"<br /><br />Give yourself a gift and buy or borrow this album and enjoy every moment of it.<br /><br />Cheers!
B005ZOCF5E|3.0|A little too obviously the opening shot of a new series. It seemed to me like Reynolds was struggling to puff up the work count to meet genre expectations.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was captivated by the voice of the main character.  It sounded very real to me.  Sad as the story was, it still managed to be uplifting.
B002AKPECW|4.0|Nobody plots the far future like Reynolds. A timescape of vast dimensions with characters that actually have character, including the robots. Some plot churning in the middle, but by the end, left me wanting more.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|my daughter had been asking for this set for some time, I was extremely pleased when there was the black Friday sale and this was in stock.
B005KELQEU|4.0|Ok well this was great.  The purchase price was a steal at under $15.00 (even less in AUS) and getting my hands on it proved a blessing.  Beautiful soft leather with a padded inside proves just the thing for my well loved kindle and enhances my e-reader to boot.  The zip is fine and the brand is well known world wide for all kinds of things so you can't lose.  All in all a great purchase of a highly recommended product from a fantastic supplier.<br /><br />Greggorio (LR)
B0015ABRE2|5.0|very pleased to find this and at such a reasonable price, my daughter loves this show and I was glad to be able to get two seasons for her.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this is a very cool app.  i got it free, but would definitely recommend it.  would definitely pay for this quality app in the future.  lots of fun to draw your own characters.  the game is very fun and something different.  great job on this app
B000V86OKG|5.0|very pleased to find this and at such a reasonable price, my daughter loves this show and I was glad to be able to get two seasons for her.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|New Total Recall sucks.<br />Compared to the orginal, this move stinks.<br />Bad story line and bad acting.<br />No one should buy / rent this film.<br />Go to Target and buy the orginal 1984 version( $5). It's 100 times better movie than this crap.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was challenging yet not too much to ruin the fun. You don't get penalized for using the hint button and it had a good story. It was a little expensive but I was so far into the game that I couldn't not pay to see what happens. I guess that is what the creators count on. REALLY GOOD! Would like to see sequel.
B004EPZ070|4.0|I have seen this movie about 7 times and really liked it.  Sure, Kate Hudson plays a daffy girl, and the plot seems ridiculous, and the central male character is a doofus, bbut the interaction of personalities make it a great date movie!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is one funny movie, especially to watch in groups. I hope to buy it soon!<br /><br />You won't be dissapointed.
B0000057C5|5.0|This is an amazing album full of heavy industrial riffs and intricate synth lines. This is my favourite Rammstein album along with Mutter. All the songs on this album are wonderful so I couldn't pick my favourites without naming all the songs. I recommend this album for anyone into hard rock, metal and electronic music...you won't be disappointed!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Perfection :)<br />Most definitely a must read at first I wasn't sure whether I wanted to continue reading the series after the first book. I didn't see how it could really progress any further in an interesting way, but this was better than the first!!
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Great plot and character development throughout the 3 books.  Totally recommend reading it.  See my detailed commnets on Book 1.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|gripping trial/hearing testimony with interesting psychological aspects but the preposterous multiple twists in the last 30 pages are melodramatic and unbelievable, including a deus {better, reus] ex machina-- a deeply disappointing ending
B001N1DPDE|2.0|Got the knife, return it next day.<br />No only it was dull, this knife feels awkward.<br />Way to heavy and UNNECESSARY thick.<br />I didn't like it one bit.<br />Got a Knife of Alaska in the same box and WHAT A DIFFERENCE.<br />The KaBar is just a big unsophisticated piece of metal next to the Knife of Alaska.<br /><br />Unless  you like a HEAVY Extra Thick knife, look at something better.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think it was amazing because it has more than 1 story for $7.00 on the kindle fire. It was 1 of the best book ever.
1603420398|4.0|Very nice book and designs are nice. I am a beginner and the patterns are easy to read if you have had some experience with the abbreviations. They do have a chart with the abbreviations in case you have trouble.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Trouble with The Curve is a predictable movie with a good cast.  Clint Eastwood has the grumpy, ready-to-kick butt old man down pat while Amy Adams mixes charm and strength in a good balance in her character.  Trouble with The Curve is one step above a Hallmark movie.  The audio was problematic and it wasn't due to streaming.  Between Mr. Eastwood's whispering voice and several scenes with poor audio between Adams and Timberlake, I was constantly hitting the volume on the remote.  Overall, it was a good movie for a wintry or rainy afternoon.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautiful costumes and sets. Engaging plot. Can't wait for the next episodes. PBS has done it again with a real winner for Masterpiece Classics.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|I am so sad that this monitor didn't work for me. We have a large house (5000 sq/ft) and the nursery is upstairs. I tried countless times to get this to sync up to our home wireless network and it always disconnected after a few minutes. I wanted to use this so I even upgraded my cable modem and got a new router as well. Nada. I couldn't even get it to work in the same room as the router let alone upstairs in the baby's room. It worked great when it was connected to the router with a ethernet cable but wirelessly this thing is horrible.
B00633W614|5.0|...and the suspense continues. The end came way too soon. It will be hard to wait until May for the next book in this series.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I ordered this for my husband who is a drmmer and he absolutely loved it!  He especially loved the DVD :-)
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|very cool! i love it!  it rocks!  I want more games like it.  good sense of humor too.  I heart draw a stickman.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|It's long but worth the read.  I actually learned a lot about the social economic issues of this period of time that I was not aware of.  Follett was masterful in creating and weaving characters into history.  It was great.  I've already bought the next in the Century Trilogy.  It's a little challenging keeping track of all the players across the various countries and time periods but worth the effort.  Great read.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|The set is really well made and my 5 yr. old granddaughter loves it. She played with it and her new Hape kitchen for hours on Christmas and the next day. I thought she might be a little old for it, but she adored it. What more can you ask for?
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This DVD is so good that I can barely wait to get volume 2. Martin Scorsese did all of us a wonderful turn when he opened up George Harrison's material world for us. The CD is equally superb! - Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus' - Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus'
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A man discovers a \\"rabbit hole\\" of sorts and suddenly discovers himself back in the past. The question to ask himself is what to do with the knowledge of the future.... does he change the past or leave it alone? That is for you dear readers to discover on your own!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Another in the series of winning CDs. What a record.<br /><br />It is not possible to get too much of Diana. Stylizing classic music with innovation, energy and a quality of showmanship that shines through with each track. Truly, remarkably gifted. Thanks for sharing Diana. While I'm enjoying 'Glad Rag Doll' (and admittedly thinking of the Four Season song), I am awaiting the next album. - Prof Michael Haller
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a great book. I could barely put it down. It was so captivating, I didn't want to stop reading.  Another great from Nicholas Sparks!!
B007IE4DSG|5.0|This CD is so good that I can barely wait to get volume 2. Martin Scorsese did all of us a wonderful turn when he opened up George Harrison's 'Material World' for us. The DVD is equally superb! - Michael Haller, 'Captain Soul's Sound Circus'
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|My husband wanted me to get it, he likes it but I don't at all!<br />I will get rid of that game!
B000MV90B2|5.0|Remarkable! This pre-CG production brings a level of liveliness and believability that is well founded in historical documentation. Really, thoughtful, well produced and directed segments. - Prof Michael Haller
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow, what a great book, I couldn't put it down. Told all my friends about it! They read it also.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Brian Wilson returns to the fold in a very big way. The sound, the performances, the entertainment value is so extraordinary. The sound, production qualities and visual impact give you the feeling you're right there with them in the concert. Inspiring! - Michael Haller, drummer, Captain Soul's Sound Circus
B00846REIS|5.0|Wow, what a great book, I couldn't put it down. Told all my friends about it! They read it also.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Laurence Olivier's 'The World At War' is the definition of well documented understanding of the extraordinary period of history known as World War II. It brings a fresh approach and perspective adding to the line of reports and documentation of World War II. - Prof Michael Haller
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow, what a great book, I couldn't put it down. Told all my friends about it! They read it also.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I really wish it would continue when I exit it to the home screen. It is almost useless without this capability.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game, I play whenever I have a chance, in the waiting room for a MD appt. etc. Now  I need to search for tetris also!
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|app sucks,need android current.app does not give enough info to make judge if you want to invest time to continue
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the first romance novel I read, and I was very leary about it, but all my friends and coworkers read it so I did too. Wow, what a great book, I couldn't put it down. Told all my friends about it! They read it also.
1450419895|5.0|In my opinion this book is hands down the BEST written and illustrated book to assist you with learning your body and the proper form while strength training. There is a lot of confusing and bogus info available on the topic of bodybuilding and exercise but I trust the information this author shares. Everything is explained well and is very easy for beginners to understand, but also in-depth information is there as you progress. I am purchasing a copy after borrowing it from my local library 3 times (and renewing it the maximum allowed borrow period each time!)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I am a long time fan of Tom Clancy and loved his signature action packed novels.  Those who love the original characters in Clancy's signature novels will be right at home with this book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I was in constant wonder of what was going to happen next and how Pi would be saved.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was an enjoyable account of the whole episodes.  I rated it 4 stars because a good portion of the book was devoted to the author's seal training.  The actual mission was avery exciting read.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My son loves to check himself out in the mirror which is why I originally bought this.  Hoping it encourages hims to crawl soon.  Love that it easily plays a song and moves.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read reviews that almost made me back out of reading Mockingjay. I am so very glad that I read it anyway. I was very pleased, it was just as I had hoped.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 3 year old grandson showed me how to play this fast moving game.  My daughter has it on her iPad and he loves it and now I'm loving it too.  My sister fell in love with it and downloaded it to her smartphone.  Great fun!!!
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|Spend lots of time playing with the family. Fun for all and no batteries needed. Great deal and greattime for us
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game and the many choices you have.  I have recommended it to a few people already and they are as hooked as I am.
B00723NWJE|5.0|This CD was given as a Christmas gift. It was what I expected, what I wanted, and arrived on time.  I imagine it plays well, because I have not heard any complaints from the recipient.
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|MOVIE WELL WORTH WATCHING<br />DONT WATCH IT IF YOU RECENTLY LOST SOME ONE. ITS VERY HEART FELT MOVIE. MAKES YOU THINK
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|very good story and hog game. wish that there were more like this,not all of the hog games story line is hard to follow but this one not so much, really enjoyed this one.
0517527413|5.0|I am not a scholar, just an old man enthralled since he was a child with Dickens and his Christmas Carol. Year after year my wife and I have attended staged productions and in-character readings using the original text with Dickens own stage notes from his famous reading tours of his book. We own many copies of the book in formats from graphic novel to abridged to full text with various illustrators. We listen to an audible CD of the unabridged text and we watch several of the many video productions, long past and in our own past. But, this is the most rewarding book for our interest in A Christmas Carol.<br /><br />Line by line the full text by Dickens is annotated with history, explanations, illustrations, and illuminations of the authors words and the times in which they were written. There is no following of tiny footnote numbers back to some mass of footnotes and then returning to the place, you hope, in the text where you were reading. Text and notes are woven into every page, easily at hand all of the rime.<br /><br />If you have ever wondered about anything in the book or its many movie versions, this book has the answers. It is absolutely great! Too bad it is so expensive. My copy was a sort of bargain at $100 from an Amazon seller. Every library should have a copy. It should be offered for sale at every on-stage production of the story around the country.
B0041O40EI|5.0|My 13 yr old grandson couldn't wait to begin assembling this cityscape. He loves it and has collected several in the series. He aspires to be an architect. Thanks, patricia
B001V7UXG2|5.0|My wife and I are on our third time through watching the entire series, and have been Wodehouse fans for decades, having read all the &#34;Jeeves&#34; stories decades ago. We bought this set for friends who we felt deserved it...:-)
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|My husband loves action movies . . . and I do too but I need plot, characters to connect with, and an ending with some meaning.  That's what I got out of this futuristic, mob thriller.  Loved it . .
1419705849|3.0|The kids liked the book but not as good as the 1st couple of books in the series.  A fun read.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I'm not that big into this series but it's action and that's what my hubbie likes.  I did enjoy the offbeat theme and darkness of the movie and the plot behind Bain.  Also, Anne Hathaway's spunk made it more enjoyable . .
B004FP1WX0|2.0|The movie left me with a depressed feeling.  The movie did not fit the description as a suspense-thriller.  Would only recommend if I wanted to make someone feel sad or to keep my daughters off facebook.
B007URCTOG|4.0|Interesting plot and compelling, but just not as good as I thought it should be.  I wanted that &#34;Notebook&#34; feel and was left wanting.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book! Kept me up to all hours of the night reading.  I loved Stephen King as a teen and young adult, but later when he went off onto the Dark Tower books and ones like it, I lost interest.  This story is compelling and grabs you right from the start.<br />Also, I enjoyed the &#34;what if history had gone differently&#34; aspect of it.
B00932ANQM|5.0|What an enduring tale that just chalks up the romance not to mention a few steamy scenes to make you hit rewind . .
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Enjoyed it very much. It was different having the girl and his  protection of her, especially in his line of work.
B007V65R54|5.0|Because you're reading this in the first place, you've probably already heard of Nate Silver. Unlike most professional predictors, Nate has an excellent track record, and this book is an immersion into the secrets to his success. Almost everyone, from Bayesian masters to people completely unfamiliar with probability will learn a thing or two about prediction. While doing so, you'll be entertained with interesting stories ranging from earthquakes to poker.<br /><br />I would only warn that this is a fairly detailed book - be prepared to look at graphs and read about financial jargon. I consider this one of the book's strengths, but it is not for everyone.
1451613512|5.0|It was clear that the &#34;untold&#34; history revealed in this book is well documented, researched and footnoted.  This is an important book.  I have read non-political astounding excerpts no more than 1 page long to my students in high school, and had their undivided attention.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|The video is excellent. Bought it for a friend for Christmas. It arrived well before it was scheduled. Only problem is that it doesn't play on older DVD players.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Cool animations, but the story was too dark and grim for a Disney movie. Little kids shouldn't be seeing this movie where a daughter hates her mom so much she casts evil spells on her. The trailer made it seem funny as well, but no where near as funny as other disney movies.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I use this on my K Fire HD,and it works well--stays on when Fire goes to sleep. I really like all the sound choices. App opens upside down and does not re-orient when turning Kindle. Developer has answered my questions within a day, and has been very helpful. i wish there was a timer/bell included as I sometimes fall asleep and an integrated alarm would b handy. I like that the different soundwaves have brief explanations of when to use them. All in all a great app!
B003L77G10|5.0|I started in on The Good Wife while it was airing its third season on a whim.  Don't worry, I didn't start /with/ the third season; I borrowed the first season from a friend.<br /><br />It's amazing!  And the second season keeps up with an interesting overarching plot with various subplots intercut with the standard episodic court cases.  Ungf, I love the female characters in this series.  And I love how all the characters grow!
B006HL9G10|2.0|Previous review: This would be a great app except that it turns off when you shut your case cover or when the display goes off. Defeats the purpose of buying a (hopefully) reliable timer. Other apps I have bought work even when K Fire goes to sleep. I hope they fix this. if they do it will be a 5 star app. Until then it is useless in the K Fire.<br /><br />Update 3/8/13<br />This app recently got an update and now continues to work on the K Fire as long as you don't shut the cover or lock the screen. It must prevent the Fire from sleeping while it's on. If other apps can work after the screen locks, the developer should be able to come up with a fix. If they do it will be a great app. For now I am using a stop watch app that works even through a screen lock.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This title?  Yeah, it's what I say when I didn't hate a movie but didn't quite like it either.  Can't deny that Brolin did an amazing job and it feels like Will Smith just doesn't age, haha.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great way to pass time.  Each game has it's own appeal. Some are really easy and some are more difficult, but each is fun.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Saw it in theaters 5 times because it was that good! Cast is hilarious down to Anna Camp from the Mindy Project and Rebel Wilson from Bridesmaids.
B0043URV5U|5.0|What can I say about Bob & Silver Bullet? He exemplifies a symbol of type of freedom. The feeling characterized through his music makes me feel 'free in the wind'. It just takes you there. Much of his music reflects the freedom experienced in riding motorcycles. If you ride, you know what I mean. If you don't ride, you can have an idea what it means. Either way, in those minutes of listening...you're free in the wind.
B0063GORYU|5.0|a fun game. makes you think. better than regular solitaire. interesting. it is easy to learn. hard and fun to do.
B0058YPL66|5.0|When rating a book, movie or television series I consider how it holds my attention, how much trash language, amount of violence, & if explicit sexual encounters are included. By just watching the commercials approaching first season I made up my mind NOT to include 'Once Upon a Time'. I discovered a couple of my daughters & some of their friends. So, I gave them 1st season DVD as a gift. They were so enthusiastic I thought I would watch a couple. I began watching with my daughter when we had spare time together. Well, it wasn't long before I was sneaking to watch episodes without my daughter!! Not everyone likes Sci-Fi & some I don't either, but 'Once' has an intriguing story line, no disgusting language, no explicit sex. Well, 2nd season just started...I'm not missing an episode!
0765325950|1.0|I have severe arthritis and the Kindle was a way for me to be able to hold a book and read again, but I guess those of us with disabilities don't really count. I suppose bowing down to the narrow minded best seller charts that don't include eBooks was far more important than fans with disabilities being able to read the book. Thank you...
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|l ike any movie having anything to do with time travel l ike any movie having anything to do with time travel
B003F0VM6I|5.0|Picking up this CD was a must for one of the unsung heroes of the early days of Heavy Metal music. If you like the pioneers of Heavy Metal such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath, you need this one to go along with them. They are cut from the same fret.
0131103628|5.0|Very good book on the C language which puts C in prospective relative to other well known languages.  Covers everything.
B009B8YZIK|4.0|Halo 4 was not what I was expecting. it was BETTER,,,,,WOW,,,,, what a movie. Its not your every day flick, but BETTER,,,
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great app. As a contractor working on the job and doing inspections and bids I use it all the time. I have flashlights, I just don't carry them in my pocket like I do my phone. The light is exceptionally bright on my Samsung 2 phone. The advertising is not invasive. I highly recommend it.
B001I82RVS|3.0|Its gorey and sick. For some this movie will make them blow there meal. This will be like chewing on raw guts.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|I think this book was terrible at the end and pretty good at the beginning but still the book is just a waste of money
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|This movie will make you laugh, cry and happy. It has it all. Your kids and others will enjoy this movie. A well rounded fun flick!!!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am an avid reader.  I have nearly 400 books on my kindle and this is my first review. I don't normally bother with them, but this book is too great for me not to share.<br /><br />This by far, is the best book that I have ever read.  It is written so that you become the characters and experience all of their emotions.  Super inspiring! I laughed, cried, flushed, and cried some more. Great story that actually ends as it should.  Most times authors write superb novels, but rush the ending and you are left feeling like something is missing.  Not in this one.<br /><br />Be sure to check the tags.  This book may not be for everyone.
B002U6CJCO|3.0|This movie was okay. Full of action, and Freezer burn! Not much I can say about this movie,but a little disapponited with the out come!
B005LAII3U|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Great action and hot women. Even better in blu ray. Nice price too. Who could ask for more?
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Beautiful Disaster is the latest read in my sudden infatuation with the new adult genre. A few friends recommended this book by Jamie McGuire, and I will admit I waffled a bit about buying this one because of the drama/controversy surrounding it in the past and the varying reviews. It's one of those love or hate books, and I have to say I fall somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />I can see where McGuire was going with this, but I feel like the execution of the plot was lacking here, and I honestly believe that's something an editor or agent could clean up. There is great potential in this story, but something need to be scaled back. There's a term tossed around in fiction called \\"Mary Sue.\\" Mary Sue is a character where everything bad happens to this character, but she's still the hero. She's flawed, beautiful to everyone but herself, and is often put in a multitude of perilous situations. I felt like this was Abby all the time.<br /><br />A lot of people criticized the way Travis acted in this, but Abby was just as bad, in my opinion. Not that that's saying much because Travis has more issues than Congress. They were both horribly dysfunctional, and while I can appreciate them being a beautiful disaster, they were more of a trainwreck. Both were immature and petty.<br /><br />There honestly is a diamond in the rough in this story, but it's hard to find because there are so many layers on top of it. McGuire is one of those authors that can absolutely excel in being a writer, but still needs a bit of guidance. She has a natural, but unrefined, grace to her writing that you just can't teach. Some of the situations and characters need to be toned down, but there's something earnest about this story that kept me going to the end.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a fun and exciting read. If you like action and mysteries...you'll love it! I am typing 5 more words so this will post
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read.  Captured my attention from the very first page and was hard to put down. I have read several of Nicholas Sparks work which I enjoyed and Safe Haven was no different.
B000SW2F8K|4.0|This movie could've been a lot better and a lot less cheesy. Why the 4 star rating then? Well because despite the cheese, this movie is one of my favorites. It's fun and the scenery is absolutely AMAZING. The movie is also very bright and creates a beautiful atmosphere. The music is beautiful, and the passion is a reminder to us all to savour what our senses offer us.<br /><br />Cute show.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a nice free calculator.  It does have an ad or two but does not interfere with the function of the calculator.  The add is out of the way and can be easily ignored.  Works in a crunch.<br /><br />The only bad thing I would say is that your whole screen is used for the calculator.  I have this on my Kindle Fire.  If I am trying to figure out some mathematical for another screen it can make it a little annoying.  Just minor stuff.  For free you can not complain.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I haven't opened the cd yet but I saw the movie 3 times. Cant wait to watch the dvd! Go Channing!

B005F9TQ4C|5.0|This is one of my favorite Bob Dylan albums - it reminds me of my younger days when I lived in Spain.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves them. He's been looking for some new headphones but he couldn't quite find any that were worth the asking price. We found these shortly after though and he uses them all time. He likes to make little tracks in FL Studio and these are quite nice because they don't throw too much bass at you. You actually hear what you're creating with a fairly great amount of accuracy. Even for non-production purposes, these are nice. They're lightweight, comfortable but certainly durable. Definitely a good buy.
0307719774|5.0|I bought this book because I liked the premise of keeping a diary, but I don't really have that much to say everyday.  This book asks a question, and you answer it.  I think it will be neat to see how my answers change over the next 5 years.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the size, but I rather like it.  It's easy to pack in my overnight bag and easy to keep on my nightstand.  Others complain that it doesn't have a bookmark / ribbon / page holder.  People, really?  I cut a peice of ribbon and use it for a placeholder.  If you want to be super snazzy, get one of these [[ASIN:B007MOQFOW Bobino Slim Pen, Blue (HH44-TQ)]] little bookmark pens.<br /><br />I plan on buying another one to give my daughter when she goes off to college.  I think she'll appreciate being able to look back and see how she changes over those 5 years.  I'd also recommend for a child entering high school, someone getting married, having a baby, just about everyone!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie was great. Funny, doesn't drag and expertly animated. Since I'm a girl, I'm not ashamed to say I cried at the end. ;)<br /><br />It sends a great message that kids can easily grasp, and it does this without becoming preachy which is all too easy. I thought Wall-E was too much, but this one strikes the right balance for me~!<br /><br />Give it a shot!
B004MC0FO8|3.0|I put this on the 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD mostly for my kids so they can play a game we do in the car.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|This movie series has steadily gotten worse with every new movie released. Subpar plot and horrible acting. I mean really, there's only so many times I'll rent a movie to see Milla half naked.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This made a lot of sense to me, especially as a weight loss option.  I just don't know why the  production of such a harmful product continues in this country.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|this video is not for everyone, but for Pink Floyd fans it answers questions in video of the bands intentions from the album.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I thought this was a wonderful book. I could read it more than once. I would recommend reading it today.
0783231202|5.0|a classic underdog saga with enormous consequences. from a time in our nations history that we would rather not think about. this film does terrific job of presenting this period, not in a &#34;in your face&#34; way, but is not ashamed to present the truths and mind sets of the time i.e. the early 1800's
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book gave me butterflies, made me cry,laugh ,fall in love, endear a new friend. Absolutely love this rollercoaster book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Anyone who loves sci-fi will love this book. I am a big fan of Philip K. Dick, and this is right up there with his most engrossing stories. Couldn't put it down and look forward to reading the rest of Hugh Howey's works.
030746363X|5.0|This book was purchased for a friend interested in the 4 Hour Body and loves it very much.<br />Tim's life hacks are easy to follow and will get anyone interested in starting a healthier lifestyle easy.<br />I like that you can read it depending on the sections that interests you or like a traditional book.<br />Must get this book! After you should grad the 4 Hour Chef.

B0012GMUPE|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Here is most likely the greatest known bassist in the world in the 70's, Stanley Clarke. Stanley also may very well be the world's greatest bassist, or at least, in the top five of all time.<br /><br />\\"School Days\\" is a masterpiece of jazz, funk, & rock. Not unlike his work with the fusion great, Return to Forever, which Stanley was a long time member, & contributed heavily in writing. The man just does amazing things with his bass, whether it be electric, upright, acoustic bass, or piccolo bass, the man is a true wizard of blurring fingers, phrasing, yes, phrasing, & thumping funky monster bass! Yet he can be as delicate a harp player, gently, yet soulfully, plucking beautiful sounds from his muse to his bass through his hands.<br /><br />\\"School Days\\" is also one of the most influential bass albums of all time! Though one would not think of the bass as a lead instrument, Clarke tastefully & commandingly orchestrates his genius not only in playing, but his considerable writing talents! This is a warm accessible album, not cold, hard to penetrate free form jazz. It makes one move to it's killer grove, on songs like \\"Hot Fun\\" & \\"the Dancer.\\" It has moments of ethereal beauty on \\"School Days,\\" (my favorite cut), Quiet Afternoon,\\" & \\"Desert Song.\\" Maybe the biggest strength of this album is that Stanley knows when to let the other musicians do the talking, & talk they do! A fine group of players that compliment every song here, especially guitarists such as, John McLauglin, Raymond Gomez, & Icarus Johnson. They add a depth here that is rarely heard, shading & coloring this album beautiful!<br /><br />If you've heard \\"School Days,\\" then you know of what I'm writing of, if not, than check out this most enlightening masterwork of music, created by the masters themselves!
B004J4WLPU|3.0|I found the book and story line moderately interesting.  I do not usually read this type of book and I am not apt to change my mind soon.  I found it a little confusing at the beginning.  But I soon figured out to whom she was talking.  Through out the book she thinks to herself, talks to her sister, and to the investigators and sometime it is confusing as to which one it is.
0345803507|4.0|Read all three and I recommend it.  However, it's a little over the top and unrealistic...absolutely.  Abuse at its' finest...ugh.

0743270754|5.0|I received this(very thick)book on Thursday evening by mail and began reading it immediately. By Sunday night I had completed it. I only took brief breaks to eat, sleep and shower, I was truly spellbound. I've been fascinated by Abraham Lincoln since I was a child, compelled to memorize the Gettysburg Address in the Ohio public school system of the 1960's where the 16th President was taught like a sort of catechism. I thought I knew a lot about that most turbulent and dangerous American experience that was the Civil War, but I didn't know the half.<br /><br />I was especially engrossed in the mini-bios of Cabinet members like Edwin Stanton(what a tragic backstory), Salmon Chase(almost his entire adult life was consumed by his never-to-be-realized Presidential ambitions) and of course W.H. Seward. The fact that Seward survived the events of the night of Apr14 1865-the \\"Night of Horrors\\", alone should earn him a place in the history books as a remarkable man. The story of President Lincoln stretching out on the bed next to his injured Secretary of State after Seward's near fatal carriage accident(a couple of weeks before the assassination) was deeply affecting.<br /><br />I had also never realized what an insolent and vainglorious person Gen. George McClellan was. Lincoln's patience in putting up with this guy was simply not to be believed. In fact, I think he tolerated McClellan way longer than he should have.<br /><br />I saw the excellent film \\"LINCOLN\\" back in November. I enjoyed it, but will see it again soon. Now that I have absorbed the book on which it is based, I expect to get even more out of a second viewing.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This thing works well.  I haven't found any real problems with it, but I do wish it gave more info on wind in the forecasts.
B001MSMUH0|4.0|I checked this out of the library because I was looking for interesting audiobooks and the name caught my eye. It wasn't until I started listening that I recognized the author from a TED talk he had given a few years back- (If you haven't seen it, look it up. It is absolutely worth the 20 minutes.)<br /><br />I found this book to be inspirational, entertaining, and intimidating- all at the same time. Robinson is a good storyteller, and the book is chock full of interesting anecdotes of both famous and not-so-famous people who lived happy lives because they found their element.<br /><br />What is the element? Robinson says: \\"The element is the point at which natural talent meets personal passion.\\" By finding and nurturing this quality, we can ignite our creativity, and bring more vitality and passion to our lives and to the world.<br /><br />Robinson tells many stories of famous folk who are famous mostly because they found their passion early and were able to follow where that passion led. I found this part intimidating; how could I ever be like John Lennon, or Ray Charles, or Richard Feynman? He answered this question by many tales of not-so-famous folk, folk who discovered the element late in life, or who do work other than their passion to pay the bills. These people were particularly interesting, as it was very clear that the fact that they invested energy into their passion helped them with the other work in their lives that they were not quite so passionate about.<br /><br />As an educator, he really stressed the importance of discovering and nurturing these passions in our youth. He points out that the jobs of the future may not have even been invented yet, and that teaching kids a set of facts will not necessarily prepare them for this unknown future. Rather, fostering innovation, creativity, and collaboration can help them be ready for whatever the future brings.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book as an audiobook. Robinson reads it himself, and his British accent made the stories all the more enjoyable.nt made the stories all the more enjoyable.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|I must confess that having read all Michael Connelly's Bosch books it took me a while to get into this one...<br />Once I did, though, it was great.<br />I am always disappointed when I finish a Connelly book as I know there will not be one for a while, they are like old friends that I like to visit, although I wish I could visit more often.<br />I have always felt as though I know Harry Bosch personally.<br />Great book, looking forward to the next one
1451673442|3.0|I found this book to be incredibly hokey. Really, it was repetitive, and cheesy, and I had to force myself to finish it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Byrne is on to something important in this book, and I found that making myself slog through it helped me to get in touch with the power of gratitude to transform my experience of life.<br /><br />I gave up on the exercises early on as they were time consuming and difficult to fit into my already packed life. However, just reading a chapter or three every day or so had a strong impact on my use of gratitude and my recognition for all that is right in my world. When we remember to be grateful, both verbally and energetically, we change our perspective from one of lack to one of bounty. This helps us to feel better, and according to Byrne, helps us to invoke all the good we can imagine.<br /><br />I haven't manifested anything massive through these practices (yet) but I have to admit that I feel better, and I am noticing all the good that does come my way with clearer vision. Hot running water coming out of the tap. My general good health. A refrigerator. A car that runs. A house with room for all. This computer I type at. The information well that is the internet. My eyes, my hands, my ears. My family. A better job prospect and new opportunities that I had never before thought possible. Every single day, I give thanks for these blessings and more. And you know what? I do feel better. And things are looking up. Or at least, I am.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|When I rented this movie, I thought it was a remake of the first movie or maybe I just do not remember the first movie.  It's not.  If you like blood and guts this movie has a lot of it.  The main character, Dredd, reminds me of RoboCop, just do what you have to do no matter what. The way the environment in this movie is portrayed I guess that's what it takes.
0393342212|5.0|I am very glad to have revisited this classic work on sibling rivalry. I first read it while pregnant with my 2nd child, and there was little I could do to actualize the learning I got from this book. Now, almost 6 years later, there is so much I needed to be reminded of.<br /><br />This book reminds parents that helping our children learn to navigate their own conflict will encourage them to grow and develop these skills for themselves. Rather then stepping in and rescuing them, we can support them with our belief that they can find a solution to their difficulties. I was also reminded how taking sides can exacerbate a problem, and that sometimes children dream up better solutions than I ever could.<br /><br />There are cute and meaningful cartoons throughout the book which help illuminate common issues, as well as helpful and unhelpful responses to them. I found the advice simple to integrate, and worth the effort as I see my children working things out for themselves.<br /><br />I think this book is a valuable addition to any parenting library, and is a book I will likely revisit again and again.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|I love this movie.  Sure the plot is a little light, but this movie is highly entertaining.  Action, adventure, limited special effects.  I am also a huge fan of &#34;The Accountant&#34;.  The part was played very well.  This is just an overall good time guy flick.
1892005034|5.0|This book is a fabulous introduction to the notion that we can help create a more peaceful world by improving our ability to communicate effectively and compassionately. Rosenberg points out a disturbing fact: we have more words in our language with which to judge each other (and ourselves) than we do to express our emotions. By learning to feel and express our emotions with words, we become less likely to act aggressively from these same emotions. When we can honestly say, \\"I feel angry when you speak to me like that,\\" we become more able to own our feelings and less likely to escalate the conflict through assumptions, accusations, and violence.<br /><br />Like many other books I have read recently, this book helps us to understand that by really being present in the moment, we gain access to the ability to steer the course of the future. Typically, we are barely listening to the other, especially in conflict. Instead, we are preparing our rebuttal, mentally judging the other, chewing on the past, or worrying about the future. This impedes our ability to be truly present for what is going on. The ironic thing is that once we get in the moment, our presence and attention is often all that is needed to de-escalate the conflict.<br /><br />Rosenberg provides many entertaining and inspiring anecdotes to demonstrate the many ways one can use Non-Violent Communication. From conflicts in the Middle East and Central Africa to the classroom, from parenting to prisons to self-defense, NVC proves over and over that violence comes from lack of connection. Learning to facilitate that connection can decrease violence, increase compassion, and help people grow into more compassionate and community oriented lives.<br /><br />I found this book inspiring and educational. Rosenberg helps me to see that we can help others heal just by how we move and communicate in the world. By modeling effective and compassionate communication, we can create more peace in our own lives, and help to create a less violent future for us all.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in connecting more deeply with the people in their lives. It is especially useful for people in positions of power, who can learn to act in a way that empowers and inspires others. Parents, educators, health care professionals, managers, mediators... really everyone could use a little help in communicating in a way that enriches life for us all.create a less violent future for us all.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in connecting more deeply with the people in their lives.

B002UNMWAG|4.0|Not as good as the first, but yet still entertaining.  These boys are great.  I look forward to the third installment when released.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Having read Pillars of the Earth some years ago, I picked this title and instantly fell in love with all the new characters.<br />It is as if I just continued the saga.
1451648537|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, and I found it to be well paced and sometimes 'unputdownable'. It paints a picture of a very complex and driven man. I often wondered throughout the book whether I would have been able to work with him; and if I would have recognized the great work he was doing through a personal veil of discomfort, maybe annoyance. By all accounts he was somewhat of a bully and impossible to please, but what what end? Well, some of the best leaps forward in technological design ever seen. I put the down book feeling a great sense of loss for this amazing man, and wonder what else he would have come up with. Im sure I wouldnt have struggles with my predictive text and horrible navigation system if he was still around. I also felt very uplifted and inspired, and felt a sense of 'anything is possible with enough enthusiasm and hard work'.
B009R89CRI|5.0|It is like all other Diary's of a wimpy kid. i really love it. and a good acomplishment could be the movie
0618918248|5.0|religious or not. this is the most amazing book ever read, this book was my portal to understanding the world as a horrid place, filled with greed, misdirection, misinterpretation, and these in themselves are door openers to our planet earth, and it's people, and how just believing in god can make you senile, and unhappy, but with all bad, there is light, this book will open your mind to understanding our natural world, and helps you understand how we can make it a better place. this book has opened the eyes of my previously christian parents, and many of my catholic, jewish, muslim friends. this book is unbeknowingly better than television, and i plan on buying more of his books
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|The original and the best. All the sequals they've made cant compare to the first one. I never get tired of watching this.
0985114606|5.0|This book is a must read. It has quickly become one of my favorites. I look forward to more books like this one.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|Classic movie. Bluray probably doesnt really make it any better but it cant hurt. Pobably could use more fighting and explosions by todays standard though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a large numbered calculator that accomodates the novice in numbers to the advanced math brain. I like it because the numbers are large.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've always loved the Star Wars movies and was so excited when they were released on BluRay. I was even more excited to find them all in one pack for such a great price. Package also comes with great pictures inside.
B009IAIC5I|5.0|The vinyl worked great, and had a fantastic sound quality.  The awesome artwork on both sides was a nice bonus.  Got it in a timely manner and packed very carefully.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Great movie, its a zombie movie and a comedy, what more could you ask for, and its on bluray. highly recommended.
B00005UW9T|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid, so I had to have it in my collection.  The DVD is nothing amazing, but it does have full/widescreen capabilities and a decent special features section.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|Not as good as the first episode, but better than the second. Also better than the newer sequals that have been added since.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Is just what it is, fair price and quick shipment, to complete Kindle fire out fit for wife. Good product
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Missed season 2 and wanted to catch up before watching season 3. Very convenient to watch on my schedule. Recommend.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great story, all characters perfect in their role. I started watching the first DVD and couldn't stop, kept going back every chance I got. In fact, I watched it all twice. Came exactly as advertised
B00AAX68HG|3.0|Description says 74 levels but its really 48. Then once u pass these 48 u can go back to 3 new levels plus earn crowns in some old levels. Was disappointed w this but overall this is really fun game very addictive. cute and I like the sounds the monsters make. Didn't see many girl monsters tho like the intro page that would have been nice too... fyi this is first game I have ever got for my kindle I am not a gamer on phones rather play Wii or Nintendo :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I purchase this for my Kindle because I had played the other Angry Bird games and loved them.  This one is by far my favorite!  I don't know if it's because I loved the Star Wars movies and watched them all from the beginning, or just because they have improved the game play with more birds that have different powers...and different power ups which ever it is I was very happy to part with my money for this game and I play it almost daily.  :0)
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|did not like this app at all. it was very confusing and not at all like similar apps for other devices. i have since deleted it.  would not recommend it for kindle users
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love love love this show.  Maggie Smith is just great as well as the other actors.  I am enjoying season 3 on tv.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These stories start out somewhat slow. In the beginning, you are set up to figure out what is going on in this strange future dystopian world that the writer has created. I dare say that the first 100 or pages of the omnibus edition of Wool start to drag a little. It must be intentional because as soon as I was starting to doubt the ability of the author and the previous reviewers, he starts in with a hook and it doesn’t stop until the end. The story takes off and spins out of control with the excellent plot, character development and sometimes downright poetic literation. I have to say I love it and will continue to read all of Hugh's other works.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|what else can you say about it than that since it a utility and it does what they say and is stable
0345529057|5.0|Digested these books in a month. I like this series. I you dig fantasy for adults, you should give this series a shot. I like the paper back version so I could keep them in my back pack and read them while doing big time science.
030758836X|1.0|I am angry I wasted my time and money on this ridiculous book. It started out with the illusion that it might be a good plot in the beginning however, soon you find yourself saying over and over again \\"What?\\", \\"No Way!\\". Totally unbelievable. I kept reading thinking the author must have a really clever way of wrapping up all the insanity. There was no wrap up, there was no ending. All the hateful characters and plot lines just stop. In the author's acknowledgements she writes that she got stuck when the book was 82% completed, and her editor had to help her finish it. She should have just stopped at 82%. I wish there was a way to get my money back after feeling totally manipulated and ripped off. Don't buy this book!
0553801473|5.0|Shipped as described. This book is a beast, probably weighs 5 pounds. It is a little tough to read it whilst lying down. despite all that I am completely hooked to this ASOIAF series. Can't wait to go through this book.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's a little dark, you're trying to kill off the human race. But it's so addicting and fun!! I love this game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I put the AccuWeather for Android on my Kindle Fire.  Always asking everyone else, \\"Do you know what's going to be happening with the weather?\\" was driving me crazy. I was always missing the news/weather or not getting the full weather report on the radio so decided to try AccuWeather on my new Kindle Fire. This is GREAT!  Now I not only know anytime & anywhere what the present weather is where I live (20 miles from where I am all day long), but what's expected by the late afternoon, that night and the next 5 days. I can even get a 15-day prediction and in multiple cities & states and put them in a list of my favorites.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I could not put it down.  Beautifully written and the storyline kept me enthralled right from the beginning to the last page.  One of the best books I have read this year.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I put this app on my Kindle Fire for my granddaughter (7 yrs old) to play with for short spells while riding in the car.  Not only did she get hooked on it .... so did all the adults in our family.  At first it seemed childish and none of us wanted to admit we liked playing with it, however,before long it became apparent we were all trying to see if one could beat the others score!<br />  It's a FUN Game with lots of differing options to keep it interesting.
0316017922|3.0|This book states so many different facts and theories that make you think twice about certain things barely even crossed your mind before. I do not know if the facts that these people try to prove to you are really real or not but in a weird way they all make sense. It was just okay in my part though.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|Awesome flick! It's a shame the way the Oil companies lie about the damage they are doing, and the way so many greedy politicians are helping cover it up.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|This is a very entertaining game, I really enjoyed it. However I rated four stars due to cost, I feel 5 bucks is a little much. But if you are okay with price, I recommend on kf hd.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|This third book of the Outlander series will not disappoint fans of Jaime and Clare Fraser and leads us into new characters for the next generation of timeless romance!  Finally, they are together for what appears to be always; There are at least three more books, so what will happen next?  I gave it four stars instead of five b/c it took them FOREVER to get to the 'promised land' of the New World.  No real couple would make it through some of the scenarios that Diane envisioned, but then, isn't that why we love them and her?  Read on!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We could not stop watching it . Cannot wait for the next season to come out! I recommend to get all the seasons at once or you will be left guessing and waiting like us. ;)
1423140605|5.0|Waiting for The Mark of Athena is like waiting to go to a public toilet and there's a loooooong line. So when it finally came out, I snagged it at my local bookstore.<br /><br />The Mark of Athena doesn't disappoint, humour, action and darn right depressing scenes play over your eyes like spilling beans. Never had I enjoyed a book like this so much! (This is one of my shortest reviews ever by the way) The way Riordan writes captures your attention in the first paragraph is just so mesmerising and addictive!!<br /><br />I ship PERCABETH!!!  The Percabeth reunion was TO. DIE. FOR!!!! Beautifully written and well prorated the characters.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, I know how bad your feeling so go read it!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this game. Some of the rules, I wish I could alter which game or rules I would like to play, but I love it anyway. The kids love it also. It is fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the these books they are amazing!!! I am kinda upset at how the last one ended I felt like there could have been more to it, but nevertheless they are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! Team peeta!!!!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I enjoy this app. I only have one complaint, and maybe I just don't know how to do it, but I would like to be able to put what I download somewhere, so I can get it to my computer. I have tried but can't figure if I can do it or not. But What I have downloaded...I love and it has worked great.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|this game is fun and addicting. I play it and so do my kids and we all like it.it's challenging at some levels but still easy enough my 7yr olds can do it too.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|I think this book is good for people that don't know English or for people that don't know English it also helps me when  I  didn't<br />knew English so I think it's perfect for that tipe of people like me to me is like 90./. of hel
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I cried an I even fell in love with Holder right along with Sky. I am just sad the story is already over. A must read for anyone that can handle some of the more mature situations an language.
0425252868|5.0|I saw references to this encounter years ago and always wondered what actually happened.  Adam Makos does a fantastic job of writing about the remarkable lives of two enemy combatants that become friends after the war.  The book is well researched and very well written with lots of captivating photographs.  This book makes a wonderful addition to any personal library.  I liked the electronic version so much, I had to buy the hard bound version for my collection.  If you like true flying stores, get this one; it is a unique story about two unique individuals.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I really like this email program and use it all the time.  I prefer using this program instead of using a computer.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read every one of Vince Flynn's novels, and this one did not disappoint.  I started reading it after dinner one evening and finished it at 2 AM!  It's a great read.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I got no complaints except I would have preferred the undo button on the main screen.  It's challenging and it builds up.  First impression of the game is good.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|I am not going to attempt to defend the historical accuracy of this movie, nor the feasibility of the plot. Obviously it is ridiculous to do so. However, I will say that this is a good work of *fiction* that explores some fantasy and yes, some facts, about pre-historic man. I found the relativity of technology interesting. For example, one civilization is purely stone, but gets attacked by a civilization that uses metal (copper?). The metal users also have horses, so to the stone civ seems like 4-legged demons. (spoilers) Then later you see an even FAR more advanced civ. Obviously these types of boundaries must have existed, and it is interesting to imagine what would happen if these bumped up against each other. This movie does explore that.<br /><br />Man, or some form of man, existed for millions of years before present day. Rarely do movies, or books for that matter, try to explore what life must have been like at those times. This movie attempts to do that. It is not perfect, but I give them credit for making a competent attempt and coming up with an interesting story. I know a lot of people will laugh at historical inaccuracies. Remember, though, anything that is 100% historically accurate would probably not be exciting for 90 minutes. You have to embellish the material a bit to make it entertaining..
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I utilize this program a LOT.  Easily to transfer from your computer to your Kindle and use the files you have.  I use the excel program of this especially.  It doesn't have as many features as an Excel program on a computer but it's got a few that are helpful.  Great for us novice users.
0765325950|5.0|It's bittersweet to see the ending of a series that I've been reading for so many years.  On the one hand it's finally here, the wait is over.  On the other hand, it's over.  I think Brandon Sanderson does a marvelous job of taking what Robert Jordan left behind and wrapping it all up.  Not every plot thread is neatly tied off (nor should they be), but the major ones get addressed.  The ending is satisfactory and enjoyable, and isn't entirely predictable (something I value greatly).  Is it perfect?  No, but that would be impossible.  To give every character the space they deserve would require another entire book.  Don't be distracted by all the 1 star reviews whining about the lack of an e-book.  This story deserves all five.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I like being able to monitor the status of the stock market with this app.  It keeps up-to-date and is very informative.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I wanted to review this book because I found this book to be very good. It's definitely as good as her other books. I read it straight through yesterday after buying it for my Kindle.  No romance with Ryan in this book but other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love the ones set in Canada because it's a new experience / landscape for me.  This book took me to the far reaches of the country and included some First Nation people which was a nice addition. Looking forward to the next one!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Politics and greed create wars and ordinary people fight and die in them.  That is a combatants' job.  Then along comes a person who's personal pride rises above all else and he does the unthinkable.  He helps his enemy escape instead of doing his job.  He never looked for or expected any accolades or rewards.  Decades later he met the living survivors.  His reward was love and respect plus some great friends.
0061900656|4.0|Cute, easy to understand story about a little boy that becomes a big brother.  The pictures in the book helped to show what an important job it is to be a big brother for a new baby and helps the child understand that he is just as important as the new baby.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Another amazing cerebral story by Chris Nolan aided by a stellar cast . DiCaprio as usual is very good and the supporting cast of Gordon-Levitt ,Hardy , Page and Watanabe deliver . The effects are spectacular to say the least.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I did not give it five stars because I'm not a fan redundancy, which this story has a lot of. However I understand why the redundancies are there as its pertinent to Pats character. I just got bored during certain parts of the book for that reason.
0451228731|5.0|I read my first science fiction book 44 years ago, so I understand that the premise of SF is to take real science and project it into the future.  That is what Daemon and its sequel (really part two) accomplish. What appears on the surface as a technology thriller is really a grand analysis of shifting social patterns involving the current state of internet social interaction (i.e., the Social Network), online role-play gaming, technology, economics, politics, the industrial-military complex, the superficiality of today's broadcast media. Moreover,  it describes how a society can change, not much differently than it has in the past through the Renaissance, Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression, the world wars, etc. The accelerated nature of change - how fast cultural change is possible - is also in the background of these novels.  The books are well-written and fast-paced.  My wife also loved them and we highly recommend them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use, works great as a basic calculator. It looks great on my Kindle Fire HD!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story wasn't nearly as glamorous as I had originally expected, but it was still a fun read. A little &#34;over the top&#34;.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This app cannot recognize my user name or password.  I was forced back to Yahoo classic.  I will remove this from my device!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I like the fact that this book is really written by a scientific reporter, and not someone who has a skin in the game based on research they feel the need to defend. Mr Taubes does a wonderful job at presenting the evidence in a convincing, yet non evangelical way. I very much enjoyed this book.
B008MEM24S|2.0|This is an amazing game. Only it ended far too soon! Four game endows and four challenges.  Oh well I just love this game!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome set of movies for a great price. I love these movies so I am bias but you cant beat this set.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Once I started reading I couldn't stop until I finished. This book is a reminder that life comes at you hard and your forced to roll with it.
1577311523|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother, and she loved it. If you like these types of books I would recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've used three other calculators on my KF ant this one surpasses all three.  It's so easy to use, fills the whole screen, nice looking......love the history feature to go back and see previous calculations!....also like the way it shows the calculation as you go along!  It would be even cooler if I could change the colors ------happy to delete the old one/s....this one is here to stay!
0393327345|5.0|Great read, great author. I have seen the movie a few years ago, and have to say the book is amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|fun game great graphic cool character if you get this app you wont regret it plus you get to challenge. your. friends. and doesn't everyone. love a challenge
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a great bag, it has many different compartment for lenses and anything else. This bag also fits my 13&#34; Mac Book, which is what attracted me to this bag.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|Pages 165 - 180 of the Amazon Kindle edition of this book are completely without illustrations.  My son loves the book, but is extremely disappointed with the technical error.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This product works for simple operations but there are better options.  It does not go to landscape when I turn my Kindle.  I was not impressed with the screen layout.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game has amazing quality and even better gameplay! Reminds me of Zoo Tycoon alot!!!! Can't wait to experience more of the game! :D
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is incredible!  I will listen to this for many years to come.  Superb cast and having members of the original Les Mis cast was a real treat!  EXCELLENT!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Bought for a girl that loves Star Wars, but not SciFi, and she's loving this series very much.  Great writing and dialog, outstanding sets and effects.
0060264306|5.0|A favorite of my childhood passed on to my granddaughter.  Wilder's books are pretty much autobiographical and provide insight to the life on the mid-America frontier.  The early books, in particular, are written in clear enough prose from young readers to understand, but that should not lead you to believe that they are just for children as they provide a very graphic picture of frontier life when people had to do for themselves.  The &#34;Little House&#34; books have a worldwide following and people from as far away as Japan make pilgrimages to visit Pepin, Wisconsin, where Laura begins her tale in the Big Woods.  My ten-year-old granddaughter received this book for Christmas and had finished it three days later.  I cannot think of a better testimonial.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Bought for a girl that loves Star Wars, but not SciFi, and she's loving this series very much.  Great writing and dialog, outstanding sets and effects.
B0041QSZJM|4.0|It's very satisfying to get a different twist on the repertoire  of holiday music we are usually subjected to at Christmas.  Pink Martini brings a fresh sound to the lyrics and melodies we all know so well.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Enjoyed the movie and may buy it in the future.  The ease to watch it from home without going to a rental place was create.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book couldn't put it down definitely recommend it to anyone that's looking for a great read can't wait to read more
B00571F26Y|5.0|This diet changed my life!  Since going off wheat and grains 9/4/12, I've lost all food cravings, brain fog, lethargy, and 36 pounds!  Just do it!  No going back for me!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|iT WAS A REALLY GOOD BOOK!!! It took my breath away with the ending!!! it had a bunch of good characters in the book!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel:  I didn't want for book 2 to end.  Can't wait for book 3 in May.
B007P06DOK|4.0|I don't get the improvements if any against the original.<br />Also, while I remember Graceland as revolutionary when it came out -  I personally feel Rhythm of the Saints takes it higher and stronger - at this point I like Rhythm better.
1451662432|5.0|Well what can I say, quite an actor, a good Republican/Governor.  His private life is really none of my business, but his movies are great.  Have seen many interviews since this book came out, glad I own one.
B002G1YPH0|2.0|I'm sure the product will work just fine; I've never had problems with my Cooler Master hardware (besides, this one won't be very strenuously used).<br /><br />However, the default product photo shown by Amazon is of an *upgraded* product with two fans, not the single fan you get in the box.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|I have not received this one as yet, am looking forward to seeing this one.  She is so good, unfortunately, don't know who the man is....Will rate upon receipt
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. It would be better if it did not require so much energy per room, but it's overall fun.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Great movie, now I own it and can watch it anytime.  Clint is always good to watch, what a man!
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|This game is fun to play and works well, but there is a big problem.  For some reason it starts up all by itself and interupts what I'm currently doing.  Once when reading a book, once watching a video, and another time when I unlocked the screen after waking it up.  It was in a book when I put it to sleep.  It always seems to happen sometime close to midnight.  I don't like programs that interupt me, so I removed it.  Too bad, as I was enjoying it before it started to have a mind of it's own.
B0099114WO|5.0|Grat pair in this movie, watched right away.  As I have said before, once you own the movie, you can watch it again anytime...........Gotta love that ownership
B005IQZB14|5.0|The author starts out frail, lost, and easily follows others into dark places in life.  Through her long difficult journey she transforms into a strong woman who is no longer a follower, but capable of controlling her own destiny.  The book is somewhat typical of a child's going through a difficult journey to maturity as an adult, but unlike those stories, the topics and emotions are very adult.  While there are hilarious moments, it is not a cute book, but has very real raw dangers and very real raw emotions.
B004HW7JH4|1.0|Package arrived in record time. However the disc one was defective and wood not play, no reason to proceed to disc 2,3,4. Would like to send it back for replacement.
1405677864|3.0|I have not read this book before and I would have to say, I would have preffered to have this in actual Audio Book form.  I was kind of hoping this would be more like an Audio Book but with actual actors portaying the different characters.  This, instead, had loud sound effects (cheesy 40's style) and no real descriptions of the scenes like a narrator would have given.  I felt more like I was listeneing to a movie more than anything.  If you like older radio programs, you will probably like this.  It is too bad that this was my first experience with this story though.  I imagine that the full story and narration is amazing.  This was so short, I was left feeling like I had missed most of the meat of this book.
0765325950|5.0|Thank you, Brandon Sanderson, and Robert Jordan, for creating this thoughtful and entertaining book series!! I just discovered the Wheel of Time books in fall of 2012 and was able to read through without the long waits so many readers endured. I am grateful for that and enjoyed the books very much. I feel changed as a result, a better person, I trust. I tried to learn from each character. I look forward now to reading some of Brandon Sanderson's other books!!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I would still liked to have known more about Thomas's and Teresa's role in WICKED's origins. And I wasn't very pleased with the deaths of either Lana or Alec, but I was especially unhappy with Alec's demise.  TJ
B00AB55BS0|3.0|While I think the comparisons between Martin and Tolkien are pretty overblown, the first few print volumes of the series are better-than-standard fantasy fiction. After the third book, the airplane just circles the airport for hundreds of pages.<br /><br />The HBO series is a decent adaptation of the first book, with a few events chronologically shifted to accommodate the different medium. There are some characters who don't make the cut, a few who are invented, and some details that would have been nice that are left out. It is well cast, with some nice surprises. I do find a lot of the scenes involve two characters nattering at each other and my attention wanders. It gets easier to follow the second time around.<br /><br />Compared to the hash that Peter Jackson made of Lord of the Rings, this comes off fairly well. Oh, except for the weirdly unnecessary nudity and sex scenes. Those can be awkward. The violence is graphic and nasty, with the Foley artists going all out with sloshing-buckets-of-blood noises and whatnot. I tend to look away on repeat viewings. Bizarrely, my usually squeamish partner really likes the show and is on about the fourth full viewing. Go figure.<br /><br />The play count will likely rise, as you get Blu-ray discs, standard DVDs, and digital copies that work through web portals or download into iTunes. This package is a great value and makes the preorder of season 2 a sure thing.<br /><br />(This is an edit of my firs review, in which I complained about the lack of a digital download. My partner dope-slapped me and downloaded it already. So it performs as advertised. Doh!)
B009LY72LQ|4.0|I am an adult doll collector, and these dolls grabbed my attention because their detail and quality is impressive among dolls marketed for children. Every character has a unique face sculpt, and many of them have extra details- the dragon in this set has scales on all her limbs, for example. They look kind of delicate but hold up well to supervised playtime with my three-year-old, something I can afford to let her do at these prices. Mattel has really outdone itself with this line.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is awesome. Everyone should read it. I will stay away from doctors as much as I can. I feel so empowered now. Praise God for courageous men like Dr.Colin.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My wife and I signed up to pre-order this the day it was announced.  9 months later, Lucas graced us with the ultimate box set of our favorite series ever.  What can I say - of course the movies look amazing in high definition, but even the box art is incredible!  Add to that every behind-the-scenes feature in existence, and you have DAYS worth of viewing pleasure.  Of course, now Disney plans to squeeze the life out of the series, probably ending with this set being out of date and missing discs.  Still, the original trilogy and extras make this worth it for us!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|We're both sci-fi fans, and this is a fabulous storyline and the costumes and &#34;world&#34; of Avatar are great.  We've enjoyed this story immensely and can hardly wait for Disney to create the new &#34;Avatar Park&#34;.
B001O22ELQ|4.0|Alright, bad puns aside, this is a good movie.  Neil Patrick Harris decided to show that the Writers' Guild wasn't a necessary part of the business, so he created this while they were on strike.  He put together a series of shorts stylized as a video weblog and thus was born &#34;Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog&#34;.  The costumes, sets, and so forth are B-grade, but the writing is pretty stellar.  Lots of great humor, some REALLY catchy songs, and a lot of actors and actresses you'll recognize.  Worth a watch if you haven't seen it.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Looper was an exciting thriller movie! I liked the actors and the suspense wondering what they were going to do.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Who doesn't love the Indiana Jones movies?  Well, with the notable exception of Crystal Skull, but that one barely counts (thanks Shia LeBeouf).  Even discounting Crystal Skull, you're paying less than the normal cost of each of the original three on DVD.  Find this set on sale (like I did) and there's no way to pass it up.  The set also includes pretty much every scrap of behind-the-scenes material that exists for the series, which was a fun watch.  I will say that watching older films &#34;updated&#34; to high definition always seems to make the chintzy backgrounds (especially in fast-moving vehicle scenes where they are stationary and using a moving background), but they've really done a great job with the actors and props being crystal clear.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you're a Harry Potter movie fan and like the 'collect them all' concept this is perfect.  My son loves them.
0553381695|5.0|The Song of Ice and Fire series (better known as Game of Thrones, thanks to the HBO series) has been a recent highlight for me as a reading teacher.  It is a great, mind-bending series that meshes knights in shining armor, lost magics, royal intrigue, and nefarious plots.  The second book is no exception, bringing even more depth to an already awe-inspiring level of detail.  More character information, more geography details, more political strategy - in short, more of everything there is to love about the series.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Nice soft body and sweet face. Good quality. I hope my granddaughter likes the doll as much as I do.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I got the first three seasons at once and started to watch them immediately. I spent the summer catching up so that by the time the new season started, I was all caught up. I couldn't find a better price and a better condition. Do yourself a favor and start watching this series and get the DVDs; it is definitely not a waste of your $$.
B008220DGE|1.0|I didn't like the movie at all. I felt that I needed a shower. It was unrealistic. I prefer one that is more credible when dealing w/ cults. Waste of time, money, and talent. Don't waste your time and money on it either. If there was a zero rating, I'd give it a nothing because it's worthless.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|A great deal for a great show. I'm so happy I got this series and spent the best time catching up.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I figured with the large number of 5 star reviews that this would be a cant miss. I would say this book was written for high schoolers but it is a 17+ book.  So i still cant figure out why an adult would want to read about high schoolers relationship.  The book was not for a middle aged man.  If you are 17+ looking to read a novel like a high school drama (90210) then this book i for you.  Otherwise i dont recommend it.<br /><br />The book was well written just not my genre.  I'll take the blame for purchasing it and will listen less to the reviews.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As a history instructor this book popped to the top of must reads for me.  The book is not riveting, the style close to what I would expect from some of my better students, but the topic so important that it is well worth the money.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game throws a creative twist on a basic puzzle game. It'd corky, fun, and very addicting! I only wish there were more levels.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was great I thought the first was better however I still couldn't put this one down either fantastic
B005DL9O5S|5.0|My father is really into classical music and this was a gift for him.  He feels that this Tchaikovsky edition is an excellent choice for people who want to build a great classical collection for themselves.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It  was so nice to view the series again before the new season began.  I really enjoy this show and am encouraging others to watch it too.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Could not put thee book down but the twist in the end left me slightly confused I ended up rushing through overall the book is a good read
8888493190|4.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it! The art is interesting, and it is great for the price.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|Tom Hardy = Brilliant; Nicolas winding Refn (director)= rising filmmaker genius; this is a story based on a true london criminal told very ingeniously from the view point of charlie bronson(tom hardy) and filmed by nicolas winding refn (&#34;Valhalla Rising&#34; and &#34;Drive&#34;) everything about this production is 5 star. if you are a true cinemaphile, and you appreciate fine acting, buy now!!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great buy for any age if you are looking for a great gift this is it or just for your self.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I have to say I am a huge fan of all wes anderson's films; his style of story-telling is unique. &#34;Moonrise Kingdom&#34; has all the usual ingredients, excellent cinematography, witty dialogue, mark mothersbaugh's amazing music choices, a great story and a phenomenal cast. this is a must see film. buy it now.
B008BRC7BE|5.0|This record has something for everybody.  I think the variety is what I like best about it.  Highlights for me are probably the demo version of &#34;Trashed&#34; and some of the live Deep Purple tracks.  There are a few clunkers but overall great stuff.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I'm a fan of Agent P. because everyone loves someone who gets it done outside the box. Resilient, creative, confident. But, for me,  the whole Nazi thing is just used up. It became Raiders of the Lost bio-engineering! I was so excited to get the final installment of the trilogy that I probably read it too fast, as I got impatient near the end. It seemed to go a bit long. Probably could have split this one into two books.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Excellent acting, great camera work, and a question not answered, what else did Anderson see inside dredd's head?  It really is to bad that so few people saw this movie in the states, and therefore there will be no squeal.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Creative, ingenious, a wonderful story puzzle that is just right. Couldn't put it down. Probably won't go see the film because the book is so good.
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers is a masterful intertwining of paired episodes viewed only through the eyes of Victoria, who spent her childhood in various foster and group homes. Convinced that her failure to successfully remain in any placement is her own fault, she becomes haunted by her betrayal of Elizabeth, her last foster mother, despite Elizabeth's sincere and loving commitment to adopt her. This novel is not only a story of Victoria's redemption but also of Elizabeth's who like Victoria has to learn to love and forgive herself before she can love and forgive others.<br /><br />Though supported in their challenges by a florist Renata, who recognizes Victoria's skills, a floral apprentice Marlena, for whom Victoria provides the same opportunities that Renata had given her, and Elizabeth's nephew, Grant, a flower grower who falls in love with Victoria, much of the nurturing of both the love-starved Victoria and Elizabeth is achieved through learning and sharing the meaning of flowers with clients and with each other.<br /><br />“Say it with flowers,” has new meaning for me now as does increased empathy for any foster child who has been cast out into the adult world without the nurturing of love.
B004LDLI0S|4.0|After reading a very dense biography of Hitler, I decided to read his book [Note: I've read all three major translations and this is the easiest to digest]. His political insights are top-notch, as well as his understanding of basic human nature. This is not a book full of racists rants. It's a discussion of Hitler's political views and a history of his political actions to date while he was in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923.<br /><br />I will add that a good understanding of European history gives this book more depth. It's hard to understand the mindset of a German during Hitler's lifetime. However, a very objective and non-ethnocentric read of this work is quite revealing. It's important to keep this book in context with the time it was written. I found highly interesting his detailed account of the beginning of the NSDAP (Nazi) party simply for the organizational brilliance and unrelenting effort, agenda aside.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great app.  Hours of entertainment, no crashes, bugs, challenging. If you enjoy card games, add to your collection. Have fun!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|my daughter loves to choose her own sounds that she wants to put her to sleep. after she falls asleep I get to choose my sounds! I like the river!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I gave it a 4 star because it is his first book and I want leave room for improvement. I liked the plot it was well planed. Almost every detail was used later in the plot. I recommend this book as a great introduction into Jack Reacher.
B008602KQI|5.0|Really enjoyed and have watched it often since I first saw it. I plan to see more Jennifer Lawrence movies.
B00ADII8YE|2.0|Great show but amazon will not allow this content to be streamed to appletv. When I purchased the episode I though it would be a simple deal to watch the episode I just paid for on my tv. Not what I thought I was paying for
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book about the life of Charlie Brown and the men in this book. It was a fascinating<br />story that helped me understand the war in Europe from the Americans and the German side as well as they<br />fought in the desert and in Germany.  I recommend it highly.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This works good on my kindle fire hd. I'm glad to have something to keep me aware of how healthy my battery is. Thanks for a good app.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|After reading all Grishman books, I think The Racketeer is one of the best, quite creative and with a lot of suspense. I read the book in two days while I was in vacations...
B00973902K|5.0|It is a song, it doesn't skip, it plays on all my devices, and it gets stuck in my head for days: 5 stars!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie was just OK.  There are some very funny parts but I just didn't care for the lame plot and the love story
B0063IH60K|5.0|One game, hours of fun! The graphics are changeable, the interface is responsive, and you can get lost in the simplicity of a classic game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I choose this book because it had five stars and was considered as one of the best 100 books sold.  It didn't disappoint me.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is highly addictive! I have to set an alarm before I start playing, or the whole day will just slip by. I don't mind the ads, because they don't interfere with the game play. The levels are enjoyable, increasingly difficult, and constantly adding new twists. There are enough levels and screens to keep anyone captivated foe weeks.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Just couldn't get into this book, and only read the first part of it and knew that it would be a struggle to finish.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I loved using this app, and it worked as advertised, but it did not give me enough control over how I wanted to use it. I would give it five stars if I could change some of the settings, such as how often it checks for mail. It was intrusive enough to crash my tablet at just the wrong times. My tablet runs much better since I deleted it. I found it faster to check my mail through my browser...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|great book!  really felt for the characters!  not as steamy as i was told, but charming and the plot twist is crazy!  dont give up before half way.  its not boring at all in the beginning but towards the half way point, i couldnt put it down after that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wow! What a truly innovative game. Start with the smaller grids, and move your way up. There are enough grids to slow down the most intuitive mind. The lower grids are easy, but can be therapeutic as you mind quickly solves the puzzle and tells you hand what to do. When you reach that level where you slow down, the game takes on a new dimension as your mind struggle to fill in the grid. A wonderful way to spend time engaging the brain.
B004VFYOA2|3.0|I'd have to say that this Whitesnake DVD is just &#34;OK&#34;. The musicianship, stage performance and the camera work is exceptional. But, I was disappointed with David Coverdale's vocals. His voice stared getting irritating after a few songs. If you are a die-hard Whitesnake fan, then you'll probably love this DVD. If not, you might want to skip this DVD and look for another live performance from David Coverdale and the boys. I personally wanted this live DVD because I'm a Steve Vai fan. I used to own a Ibanez Steve Vai Universe 7-string guitar like Vai's and watching him play his Universe brings back memories of how Bad Ass that guitar was. I'm still kicking myself for selling it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read, descriptive and captivating! I want Katniss to truly love Peeta. Hopefully in book two they will be together...sigh
B00008BLAS|5.0|Another Bad Ass album from Mark, Don, Mel & Craig. With Todd Rundgren in the booth producing this album, he took GFR to another level. Plus, you get to hear Mark Farner's Veleno aluminum guitar throughout the album, which sound's kick ass. I should know because I own one. I bought this album when it was first released back in 1974 and the remasterd CD sounds even better. The &#34;Locomotion&#34; is their No. 1 hit off this album, but my favorite song is the title track - &#34;Shinin' On&#34;. If you are a Grand Funk FREAK like me, you'll love the bonus tracks added to the remastered CD. I even saw the &#34;Shinin' On&#34; tour in 1974 at the Civic Center in Omaha, NE and if you happen to find a boot leg video of that tour (which I have) along with this CD, you'll go back in time to relive this awesome era of Rock. Keep it Shinin' On, people!!!
B006IN2F10|5.0|Great book and very well read. I hated to have it end. I think that more people should listen to them.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|This is a great Sci-Fi DVD. Great special effects and an interesting take on the camera work. It is supposed to be a video documentary of a friend's going away party with a hand held video cam and ends up being a continuous video of event's that take place during and after the party. You get a sense of spontaneity and realism. The &#34;special features&#34; show you how they made the movie and special effects. Very Cool!! I highly recommend it.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|The Blue Ray is exceptional quality. The special features are amazing. If you're a fan of the show, this is a must have.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good story line.  A thriller with the implication of the paranormal, which includes romance and denial in a  quaint setting.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|If you haven't already seen the 60 minutes on Searching for Sugar Man, or read anything about it, don't! I went into this documentary not knowing at all what to expect, and it ended up being my favorite movie from 2012. The story itself is an incredible one, filled with intrigue and beautiful moments, and the story is told beautifully. If you're unsure about watching this, just watch it! You won't regret it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read every Grisham novel and this one didn't disappoint.  I really enjoy his writing style and the plot moves along very well.  Ready for the next one!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|A teen suspense novel, with little suspense. A silly cast rambles through confusing situations. Better for Mr. Grisham to take a vacation than to serve up such a lame offering. Embarrassing disappointment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book I thought it would be to young for me in the beginning but no way I fell in love ( live) with the characters and couldn't put it down nor would the tears stop flowing I wish there was a follow up book to let me know what happens wirh holder and sky because the werw so real to me I felt like I was right there with them.. im going to miss them
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just another person who loved this book! I started at 10pm one night, not having any idea what I was getting into. Stayed up until 4:30am reading it. I could've read it much faster (easy read) but I kept going back an rereading things because it was so good.<br /><br />When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't stop myself from rereading my favorite parts!<br /><br />Thank you!
0307346617|5.0|This book was great. I found great enjoyment in the way the author went into great detail to show the reader how people from different cultures, different ideologies, and different walks of life dealt with the zombie plague. He also went into painstaking detail of countries with different topographies that either were a great help in defending against the hordes of the undead or were the reason for their doom! I recommend this book to anyone who likes horror books. This novel was a very quick read, and the author Max Brooks really delivers a fantastic tale!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This is a wonderful case.  It's stylish and well built, and it protects my daughter's Kindle nicely.  I recommend this product to anyone who has a Kindle.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The DVD was damaged, which I discovered half way through the series.  Plan to purchase Seasons One and Two soon.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I recommend this Blu-ray. An excellent movie. Great quality, sound it basic, not much could be done with what was available.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The cover does an adequate job for me.  It works pretty well as a stand, but could be improved.  It is a bit difficult to use when wishing to charge the Kindle as it must be turned around which makes the Kindle more difficult to use - you have to hold it to keep it from falling flat.
B0042JIL2E|4.0|I enjoyed listening to this CD. I bought the disk after reading a description of her background and how she came to her type of music. I wasn't diappointed when I listened to the CD for the first time and realized I have already heard her music in at least one movis.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great series!!  Encouraged by my adult daughter to watch the series, I have had to play catch up so I would know what is happening in the new episodes!!  I stopped to watch another series but Downton Abbey is the best ever!
B00881VLCE|3.0|Very easy puzzles. Not very challenging. Fun to do when you have a short time and can't be reading a book.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Great cover for my Kindle!  It fits nicely - the stretchy bands keep my kindle in place without damaging the unit.  There is a side pocket for a few pieces of paper, but not much else.  I feel that my kindle is well protected without being too bulked up. The cover feels sturdy and I think it will last daily use.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Like being there watching it on the big screen all over again--AWESOME-I even got one for the car!!Go and get it!!!
B004R13U6Y|2.0|The functions work great, where I can edit my PDF documents, but interface has still much more to go.  It's really sluggish and slow when turning pages.<br /><br />There's no undo function, so if I mistakenly draw something, it stays like that.<br /><br />The menu button has a conflict with kindle's own dropdown tab when use in the landscape mode, thus I was not able to access the app menu button which was really frustrating.
1416583432|2.0|I'm half way thru and can hardly stand it - I'm only continuing in the hope it gets much better and to hopefully somewhat justify the purchase.<br /><br />Way too much repetition, with disjointed sections that meander. The tone is pretentious.<br /><br />Don't buy into the hype - it's really not very good reading.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Not the greatest but still it entertains and keeps things interesting through out the whole book.  Second Reacher book I've read not as good as the first.  The characters are simple with no depth to them.  They remaind me of typical characters for a TV action series.  I read these when I feel like a little simple action that is fun to read and don't want to think to much.  A guilty pleasure I guess.  As for the movie I just can't picture Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher but then again it kinda fits the type of shallow character Tom Cruise always plays.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This movie does a good job of blending in with the other Bourne series, and leaves the door open for more.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Put this case on the phone the minute I received it.  Awesome quality.  Love it.  It works great and this case is the only case I plan on ever using.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie makes you root for the underdog.  I wish I could have been given the talent that Christina Aguilera has.  Cher still has a crappy voice, but what do you expect from the crypt keeper LOL
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy 3 phone.  I wanted to play music on my phone and didn't really want to use anything that was pre-installed on the phone.  All my music is on the Cloud through Amazon MP3.  It is a free app, you don't have to purchase other music through yet another app, and it is very user friendly.  Great app.
B005LAII80|5.0|Tight, intense and gloriously mean (with a dark sense of humor), a fitting adaptation of the excellent source material, it's sort of the Jason Bourne to the Avengers James Bond.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is simply addicting. its fun to play. my girlfriend got me hooked on playing and I cant stop lol.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I thought this was a hidden object game. There is no list, instruction s or clues how to play this game. I don't recommend this game.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another well written detective yarn That flows seamlessly to an unanticipated conclusion.  Only through Harry's preserverance and analytical mind do we see justice done. Once again Harry proves himself to be a man of integrity fortitude against the bureaucracy and interfering politics of the department.
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|There was no need for the added fiction. Come on afflack. What's with the fictional ending with a bunch of lunatics in trucks and jeeps with guns chasing the airplane down the runway as it takes off. I will not go into the other fiction at this time. This is a great story that needed to be told without the fiction. You ruined what could have been a classic. Now it will be remember as a cheesy fiction movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast paced and believable that gets the message across that were not fighting anything but a ruthless enemy that doesn't seemed to be grasped by the politicos that send our brave men and women into harms way and expect them to play by the rules against the cunning enemy that consider lying, subterfuge, betrayal, and terror their weapons of choice. The story development is credible and fast paced. Overall a very good and enjoyable read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me on my toes all the way though.... never in my life have I read a book where there was such a twist at the end! I would read this book over and over (:
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|This is an excellent movie! Well acted and true to the book.  My kids really liked it and it arrived on time for Christmas.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first. I enjoyed the book. It seems that the movie followed the book quite well. I hope to be getting the next two very soon.
B003L20ICO|5.0|This was on my daughter's Christmas list and it arrived in time! Excellent service and a good movie! Good for a movie night!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I like Seth MacFarland, but this movie was super hard to watch.  Super lame and cheesy.  Definitely would not recommend.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|very informative. I like the notification thing since it lets you know how  much time you've got left , and it's just simple to use.
B00860YICC|5.0|terrific movie-try and find another this well done; acting, directing, scene design, music-has it all!! On my best pictures list.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It needs to Update the Logo. Anyway good game. I recomend this app for Angry Bird Lovers, and anybody who plays games simlar to this app.<br /><br />#1 Amazon Customer
0345529057|5.0|Awesome books, bought them in August 2012, but I'm still reading them, as I am a college student and never have enough time to find to read the books.  I am completely addicted to the show.  My only complaint is the &#34;box&#34; in the &#34;boxed set&#34; is very flimsy and falls apart all the time, I will have to tape it soon, but it does protect the books somewhat from dust, which is better than nothing.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Five days before Christmas in 1943, over the skies of Germany, Charlie Brown, a 20-year-old farm boy from West Virginia, encountered Franz Stigler, a 29-year-old German flying ace. Brown, the pilot of a B-17 bomber with a crew of nine, was on his first mission over Germany. Stigler, in his Bf-109 fighter, already had scored 22 \\"victories,\\" or kills of enemy planes. Brown's plane, nicknamed \\"Ye Olde Pub,\\" could easily have been number 23. It had been damaged so badly its guns no longer worked. The four-motor plane was limping along on only an engine and a half. The remarkable story of how and why Stigler decided to spare Brown's plane is described in this book.<br /><br />Casual readers may grow impatient with all the personal and military background about Stigler, and to some extent Brown.  It takes 155 pages to get to the minute-by-minute reconstruction of what occurred on Dec. 20, 1943, when Stigler chose not to down Brown's plane, but to simply salute his enemy. Those 155 pages begin with the end of the war and Stigler's search for a job but quickly delve into the very start of both men's careers. You may also bet frustrated with the military minutiae -- quite bluntly, nothing of significant interest happens to these two men up until this point -- they could be any pilot, any soldier, in any war.  However, the encounter is wonderfully described, as is the aftermath.  The best part, however, is the reunion 40 years or so after the war -- it's a potential tearjerker as both men (and some of Charlie's crew) reunite and you come to understand that at least 25 more lives were saved (all the relatives of the crew) on that fateful day.  Great book!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I gave this as a gift for Christmas to my Mother in law who received a new Kindle Fire this year also. the bright color is nice, and she appeared to be pleased with the gift !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is much better than temple run! It is my favorite game. But I wish the characters would have their own special power.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|History told through the lives of fictional characters. Not designed or intended as an accurate history book. A great story filled with \\"real\\"  characters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|classic arcade with a little freshness. still only 4 boards in. easy to put down and pick up. keep adding games. thanks!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|It seems to do the job ok, but time will tell how well it holds up. I would have liked to know an identical cable is included with the kindle as it is shipped before buying this cable as an added item.  Now I have 2 USB cables when I really only needed one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THIS BOOK IS CAPTIVATING FROM THE VERY FIRST PAGE.  I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.  IT IS A REAL PAGE TURNER.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Take all of my notes on here now, and will continue to as long as I have my kindle. Very easy to use. Enjoy it.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Covers multiple genre of music, sounds like no other band, and sounds freaking amazing! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It could be a little more difficult.  After the first few games, I am beating it every time.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This is just a badass movie!! I love that it pays tribute to Jay and shows Santa Cruz life as it is.. Like other reviewers, I too grew up in Santa Cruz and other towns in the bay area and they portray it how it was and how it STILL is.<br /><br />I really appreciated them shooting the film from a TRUE local perspective - everything was filmed on site and they did not disappoint. I cannot wait until this movie comes out - I am definitely going to preorder it!<br /><br />-Also.. the song in the closing credits by Greg Holden.. We saw him in San Francisco... this guy is an amazing artist!! If you havent checked out his other music definitely do so now.. I have a feeling he's going to get big soon.<br /><br />Best of luck Holden - and in the words of many surfers and a quote from the movie - Live Like Jay!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|A beautiful story written with intense emotions and passion. Even though it was a long read I could not put it down, it was so raw I was able to bring the characters to life in my mind.
0425263908|5.0|Please hurry 3rd book! I can not wait. I love this trilogy~ It is another story of passion. May is not near enough.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This show is incredible.. Very good story line and great character development ... 10 Stars !! Get it .. u wont regret it.. Unless you dont like this genre then you shouldnt be looking at this show ..
0425263916|5.0|I read the Shade books and wanted something in relevance to them and found this trilogy. I happened to like it better than the Shades trilogy. I can not wait for the third book to come out!
159420411X|4.0|This is a well-written, thoughtful essay on prediction/forecasting. Silver encourages modesty in would-be forecasters, and frequently reiterates that the quality of a prediction depends on the quality and quantity of relevant data. Well worth a look.
B004IFYN2E|1.0|I had a hard time keeping up with the film and staying interested in it. I bought it because it had 2 strong actors, but the story line was just dull. I couldn't wait for it to finish. I only sat through it because I had already spent money on the movie.
1610454812|5.0|I felt compelled to give a quick review after listening to the audio book on a recent road trip.  The story is absolutely incredible, for so many reasons.  I'm not a religious person or even a spiritual one.  I state this because although the story deals a lot with people's faith, it is not necessary to share those beliefs to appreciate the story.  It is definitely an emotional roller coaster that will leave you feeling inspired, sad, angry, amused, and in disbelief.  I highly recommend it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really convenient and accurate. I like the fact that you can store multiple locations and have them at the ready.
B005SVVANW|4.0|Not a high quality puzzle like you'd find from Ravensburger, etc, but as far as the &#34;fun factor&#34; goes, it's really good, because it's basically a series of mini-puzzles.  For a 1000 piece puzzle, this makes i pretty easy.  I finished it in about 4 hours, glued it together and put it my son's music room.  Looks good!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the idea of a thriller depicting the demise of a marriage. Fabulous writing and clever quips permeate this novel. Gillian Flynn will be on our shelves...or in our electronic devices for a long time to come!
B003MC5N28|1.0|Hello every body!  I recommend you read this before you get the book.<br /><br />Hello, I just finished reading this book and found it super disturbing and offensive.  The thought that for Identical twin boys (whom I am) and the smaller one gets killed and put in a garbage shoot just makes me get into tears.  Thanks for reading this and take it into consideration.  Thank you<br /><br />- Sky
B0012HF5NC|5.0|My family and I enjoyed this movie very much. It was so exciting and suspenseful. I especially liked Will Smith!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was awesome. Makes up in every way for the second film. I can't think of a single complaint. Just great. I hope they don't make another one because this would be a beautiful end to the franchise.
B009O07NDY|3.0|BUT one of the reasons I bought the music was the wonderful Misty Mountains the Dwarves sang. To be honest it was for that I bought the album and there is barely a moment of the song on here. I was left very frustrated. it was there but only a cut and barely heard.
B001OSIV62|2.0|Very unsatisfied with Amazon's set up for this &#34;movie&#34;. They advertise without a preview and amazon charges way too much for this non movie movie. We only watched half of it, interesting documentary, but we were expecting a movie. Amazon shouldn't be charging for this, let alone $2.99.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Got a kick out of the tiny Decepticon Bots.  Really broke-up the fast-passed action with some good humor.<br /><br />The only thing that drove me nuts, was the non-life like action of the human bodies being tossed about constantly for more then five minutes.  In real life, a quarter of a second of that much activity to the human body, and we'd be spaghetti noodles.  Drove me nuts waiting to see the bodies burst like zits.  Another thing, the robots were shown bleeding red fluids & slobbering while yelling.  Eh, not much of a fan of blood & guts, as it's not really needed to tell a story, and disallows the younger kids from watching and learning from the story lines.<br /><br />Aside from this, gave it five stars as there are few good movies these days with a good plot line or lessons for the young to be learned.  Also, good unique humor.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|The nerd worked well. My boy totally loved it. I would recommend only using the newer blue type or newer bullets as some of our older styles and older used bullets would jam the gun now and then. But as long as you use the correct style you should have no problems.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|I thought this movie was better than Ocean's Twelve, but not as good as Ocean's Eleven.  Sequels are never as good as the originals.
0756655307|4.0|This really is a great book, well made and it's huge.  I haven't been able to find anyone missing in there and there are even separate details on individuals (many faces of The Hulk, for example) and even group affiliations.  Some of the detail in the history of the heroes or villains read like a short story - excellently done.<br /><br />My one and only gripe about it is that I was hoping for more detail on the powers of the supers.  They left this fairly generic, without a lot of detail or examples of how individuals used their powers in interesting ways.  Fairly bland for a lot of them when deeper descriptions would have been more exciting to read about.<br /><br />Overall though I do recommend this book - it's very high quality and the level of detail in the character history sections are great!<br /><br />-D
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I expected more out of this book, and I thought it would be written for a lay-person. The first part of the book tells about Dr. Alexander becoming very ill and going into a coma; the second part tells of his 'journey' while in the coma (both relatively interesting). But the third part is written like a textbook, talking about quantum mechanics, physics, atoms and consciousness. It was so academic, that I felt like I was just reading words out of a dictionary.
B007N31ZKQ|2.0|I own somewhere around 1200 movies.  Almost half of those are Blu-Rays.  This is the very first one I've ever purchased that didn't have subtitles.  I see now that it doesn't list subtitles in the description but when you're already batting .1000 you don't think you need to any more.  I always check with regular DVDs, but a blu-ray should have them, period.<br /><br />The movie itself isn't under review, it's this edition.  The movie is great, the quality on this Blu-Ray is average, what you would expect, maybe just a little less than that I guess.  The quality of the extras is a little boring, nothing exciting here and some info is just repeated exactly from other editions.<br /><br />-D
B004Y042N8|3.0|There is one simple objective of this game - to connect a set of dots without crossing over the same line twice. It begins easy and gets progressively more challenging. The &quot;glow&quot; effect adds a bit of color in the hopes of making it more exciting, but I still found it rather boring. I usually enjoy puzzle games, but not this one.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Gangam Style on The Load Screen Is Tacky And Unprofessional. Instant One Star. Could Be AN Awesome Game, The Game Plays Well BuT Has Too Much Lag. FiX That And It Will Be Much Easier To Get A Good Review
B0012QCZ54|3.0|are in this, so that was really the only reason I bought &#34;Step Up 2: The Streets&#34;. Otherwise, it was alright overall.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book captures the true beauty of life and it really does show that you should always remember the good because sometimes they cancel out the bad.
B000W1TJWC|5.0|A Farewell to Kings has always been my favorite album (I still have it on vinyl). After thirty plus years I now have it digital!
B006X5L6VS|4.0|Wish I had it years ago when camping and looking at night sky and wondering how to identify stars and constellations.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Our daughter is having so much fun with this game! Now she too can play the game that has caught everyone else's attention. She high fives when something comes crashing down!
B006WXHJNU|5.0|Unlike the 1970(s) series on TV, this movie brings the Hulk to life a lot like the comic book green monster.  Love the Marvel Avenger series movies.  Really liked the TV series, but this movie really brings the Hulk to life.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|At first I was very upset, to hear this would be comedic, I thought, worst case, the humor like Sleepy Hollow by Burton.  I really liked the original Dark Shadows series and films (I grew up with them).  But, I like how Depp portrays these period films or does period personalities, and I like Burton's humor.  So I took a DEEP sigh, mentaly adjusted and focused on the fact - that this is a re-vision of it all Via Depp/Burton....and I had to take it in as a wholly seperate film as if I'd never grown up with a DS history.  Once I got there, I love the film and what they did to toss-up the character salads and give them all an alternate flavor.  Downside was....Chloe is such a good actess and the boy that played David was good, but they needed more screen time.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|A really good movie in the Marvel Avenger movie series.  Saw this movie on the big screen and loved it.  Probably watched movie at least 4 times.  Once again, way to go Stan Lee and the team.  You guys do really well at bring these guys to the big screen straight from the comics.
1577314808|5.0|I have been wanting this book for quite a while. It arrived quickly. I am totally pleased with my order.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|One of the best of the Marvel Avenger movies in the series.  Saw this movie on the big screen and loved it.  Probably watched movie at least 5 times.  Way to go Stan Lee and the team.
B005LAII80|5.0|&#34;Dredd&#34; was perhaps the most underrated film of 2012; actually, that might not be entirely true, as critics gave it rave reviews. The underrated quality of the film comes from its box office pull: a few million shy of its production cost. The main problem here, as far as anyone can tell, was that too many people associated the film with the previous &#34;Judge Dredd&#34;, starring Sylvester Stallone. That movie was awful, and it's a shame this film suffered because of it.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is extremely straightforward: in the future, civilization has experience a bit of a backlash and everyone lives in large &#34;Mega Cities&#34;. The policing force are known as &#34;judges&#34;, and are given the power of judge, jury, and executioner. The film follows a day in the life of the toughest judge around, Judge Dredd (portrayed brilliantly by Karl Urban). On this particular day, Judge Dredd is given a new psychic recruit to evaluate (Olivia Thirlby) and is locked in a 200 story slum under the control of ruthless gang leader Ma-Ma (Lena Headey, of Game of Thrones fame). Judge Dredd and his new recruit Judge Anderson must fight to survive 200 stories of gang members.<br /><br />&#34;Dredd&#34; succeeds on many levels: it's a perfect comic book adaptation, faithful to its origins; it's a superb action film; it's terrifically acted, if you can catch the tongue-in-cheek approach of the film; and it's just so damn enjoyable. And really, that's the point of a movie, right? To provide and exciting, enjoyable experience for and hour and a half or two? &#34;Dredd&#34; is definitely a movie that scores in every way.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was hilarious. The comedy is up the with bridesmaids, so prepare yourself. I you liked Bridesmaids, this is a must see.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Every song on this Album rocks and has meaning to it, I love it and will buy anything ShineDown writes!
B008LY9AWG|4.0|These stories were great fun. Michael Connelly's writing is sharp and quick in each story.  The surprises were quite excellent.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Grandchildren enjoy this movie for hours.  Keeps them entertained as well as the entire family.  Would recommend for birthday or Christmas presents..
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This CD is one of the best new releases in a long time.  It is rare that a single CD has 6 songs that I love.  If you like It's Time or Radioactive, pick up the CD.  You won't regret it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought for my grandson and this one for my nephew.  Good  and simple understanding of respecting and protecting our environment.  Enjoyable.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Great to see Matthew McMcConaughy in a role that is absolutely perfect for him, rather than in a more dull rom-com.  Very suspenseful and pretty well written.
B000AP04L0|5.0|it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen -- right up there with Airplane -- if you like that kind of humor.

0765325950|5.0|I only discovered the amazing book series about two years ago now. I bought them all on my nook and read them in a row. Though I have only known of the series for a few years I have read each book twice by now and have the audio books. This series has had a profound impact upon me as a reader. Waiting for A Memory of Light was tiring, nothing compared to those who waited 20 some years, but the waiting was well worth it. Though some of the story arcs ended rather lamely, or were not addressed thoroughly enough, and there was a feeling, toward the second half, that it was all a great deal of the same, namely that of Trollocs fighting people, it was still enjoyable. Sanderson writes actions very well, but at times lacks the detail and complexity that marked Jordan as a master of his craft. AMoL does an amazing job of tying together an enormous book series with hundreds and characters. If you have followed the series from its start there will be heavily emotional moments, especially towards the end. At no point do you feel like the story is getting bogged down in the battle scenes.<br />Overall it was a greta way o finish the series, especially given the fact that the originator of the series was not the man who wrote it. An excellent read and an excellent ending to a marvelous series.<br />And all of the one star reviews stem from the non release of the ebook, not an actually review of the book.
0143116738|5.0|This book by Sir Ken Robinson is a must read. He uses a lot of factual information, statistics, and real-life experiences from his own life and those he has interviewed to make his point. Never did I feel like he was stretching the examples to make a point or that his arguments were not clear to understand.<br /><br />This is a great adult book that is easy to read yet still forces the reader to think about the proposed perspectives and concepts. The issues are still relevant to present day. I highly recommend this book.
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|I have been an Asia fan from the beginning. Asia and Alpha are two of my all-time favorite albums. To me, these three latest albums since reformation are quite good, but not up to the magic of the first two albums. Of the three latest albums, this is the most immediately catchy. I guess that is a sign that this album is as poppy as they ever have been, with many anthemic-style songs (Reno, I know how you feel, Faithful) that have Wetton's singing as their featured element.<br /><br />Others have lamented that Howe is under-utilized, but that's just how things are these days within the band (with Howe sharing time with Yes obligations). His acoustic guitar on \\"I know how you feel\\" is sweet, and he is at his best on \\"Tomorrow the World\\" (sounds a bit like \\"Cutting it Fine\\" on the first album), my favorite track on the album. \\"No religion,\\" \\"Faithful\\", and \\"Face on the Bridge\\" (my 2nd favorite track, even if it is a bit anthemic) offer Steve further chances to lay down some licks, so that's better than nothing. I think the most 'missing-in-action' member is actually Palmer. Wetton is in fine voice, and Downes' keyboards are the foundation for most songs.<br /><br />The one striking thing is how much this album leaves a positive vibe. They are not afraid to sound like the band of 30 years ago, without necessarily being derivative. However, they certainly are not trying to atract a new audience today. They are writing and playing to their own fans and to those who like classic rock with an inflection of prog (not the other way around, they really are not progressive enough to merit being considered a full-fledged prog band despite their previous pedigrees). Thus, if you are looking for the Asia of 30 years ago, who have come up with some catchy new tunes, I recommend this album, which is perhaps the most accessible of the three new ones (even if its highest points are not as good as those on Phoenix and Omega). If not, why are you even reading this review?
0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson's personality and distinctive voice shines through this text very clearly through his spicy humor and intense observations. He goes through the various locations and wonders of Australia and it is a clear and fun read which provides a hidden perspective of the people of Australia and their history without this being a historical novel or a tourism guidebook.<br /><br />There are some parts in the book that were a bit spiteful or left parts hanging without returning to the topic, but overall it was a fun read to get to know the living environment of this country.

1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot creates a stunning triple narrative, inter-weaving the biographic history of Henrietta Lacks and her family, the development of the biomedical field over the latter half of the twentieth century, and the story of her own ethnographic fieldwork in Virginia and Maryland with Henrietta's descendants. As a non-fiction novel, the story of Henrietta Lacks is equally as informative as it is creatively written, and maintains a fantastic balance of a fast-paced novel grounded in the reality of scientific research and its effects on human subjects. Skloot's prose is chilling and even disturbing at times in describing the suffering undergone by Henrietta Lacks during her battle with cancer, however the quality of Skloot's scholarship is of overall great quality. Similarly, Skloot allows the reader to experience the novel through heartfelt character development and a gripping tale of a woman who changed the face of medicine in light of one doctor's decision to harvest and research Henrietta's cancer cells, unbeknownst to both her and her family for decades.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book drew you in to the point you couldn't put it down. I didn't want to stop reading. The book keeps you interested from the very beginning to the very end. I am a non-reader and I enjoyed this book more than any book I have ever read.

Needless to say, I won't be playing anymore.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun and challenging.  wish u could do more levels before having to purchase full game but it is still lots of fun.

B007CKNX28|5.0|Who else could use Hip and eponymous in the same verse of a lyric and have it sound as good? Jack White simply has talent, more in his little finger than a whole lot of whose out there right now. A different sound from Consolers but no less brilliant for all that. Wonderful music, don't hear it and miss out on a musical treat.

B009K6DKTS|4.0|Assymetric management<br />About a year ago myself and Frank Hannigan decided to write a book on asymmetric management. Our argument being that actively managing serendipity is more important than business optimisation.  The way I explain asymmetric management is a reflection on far we have come with this book (not far).<br /><br />Data, marketing, planning, organisation, strategy, intuition, education, passion, entrepreneurship and the future<br />So I have been looking forward to Taleb's new book. I was right. Having read it, I think it is a core book which touches on an enormous range of books we cover with our clients. From Loose, Happiness advantage to 4-hour body, Brand Washed, Thinking Fast and Slow, The invisible gorilla, Future Babble, Everything we know is wrong, Business exposed, 33 strategies of war, Mavericks at work, Poke the box, Out of our minds, Starfish and the spider, Blink and I can go on.<br /><br />Soul in the game for credibility<br />He does not like academics, marketers, bankers, managers and futurologists. He distrusts statistics, doctors and medicine, large organisations and large systems. He beliefs in applied learning versus theory and universities, loves entrepreneurs, thinks that honour and skin and soul in the game are essential for credibility (that goes for experts, advisors, civil servants, bankers), that small is beautiful, and loves books, reflection and slow flow.<br /><br />Not sure if I would I have liked it I hadn't read those other books. But this book will most definitely make you think.<br /><br />Small shocks as antidote<br />Not going to try to explain his thinking, it is chaos theory, biology, adaptability, black swans and small shocks as an antidote to large shocks.

1433502429|5.0|If you're like me, and you love your Bible, you know how important it is to have a durable Bible.  This bible is great because of the quality in its craftsmanship - this Bible was built to last.  The ESV commentary is also helpful and very well put together.  I would highly recommend this Bible for anyone, young and old.
B0053KWDES|3.0|I'm giving this amplifier a mediocre review because the battery life is disappointing and it cannot be operated while charging. If this amp was able to be powered externally, whether off USB or otherwise, I would give it 5 stars as the amp itself seems to work well. As it is, if I do not remember to plug this amp in every evening it will not make it through two work days, even with light intermittent use.
B001E95ZHY|5.0|This movie is awesome. I bought it because Rainn Wilson (one of my favorite actors from The Office) was the lead. It did not disappoint. Will Arnett is in it, and a few other faces you will likely recognize. If you likes School of Rock featuring Jack Black you will love this movie. Rainn Wilson is an old 80s hair metal rocker that was snubbed when his band made it big. You follow him and his goofy group of teens as they take the music scene by storm. Great watch and the DVD comes with a FREE DIGITAL copy which pushes it over the top. Great Purchase.
1449410243|5.0|The Oatmeal is awesome, and so is this book. Too large of a a section on the Bobcats IMO but still great. Recommended if you like Matt's humor.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|I know most people did not like this take on the classic cartoon, but i most definitely did. My roommates in college watched this at least 30 times over Junior and Senior year. The plot is a little dark considering it is based on a children's cartoon, but the movie is beyond visually stimulating. The CGI is great, and looks really good in HD. If you liked the cartoon i think you will at least find this movie decent. Definitely a guilty pleasure movie for me.
630289915X|5.0|While the part about the guardian angel is silly, of course, it does illustrate the difficulties of life and demonstrate some Christian principles. Despite its age, I was on the edge of my seat at various points in the movie.
B001AQR39O|5.0|This season defines Californication for me. The season surrounds around Hanks interactions with his family (typical) but also a Rock Star Lew Ashby whom Hank befriends while in jail (also typical). Ashby is a great character and the development of his and Hank's relationship is gripping. The writing is still spot on and the season is filled with hilarious Hank Moody situations. If you had to watch one season of this show, Season 2 would be it!
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|look this cd is p roach i saw them on aud channel this is what they want and it rocks this cd is the best p roach yet i love the old stuff to but this cd is proof that they are here to stay p roach love you man
0711225176|5.0|While this was a gift, I also love the work of the artist.  The book contains a very satisfactory quantity of his work and the color plates are well done.  If you love Mucha, you will love this book.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great book.  Cornwell is the author I follow ALWAYS.  Her characters have so much depth they are real.  I will be waiting for her next one...just cannot get enough.
B00104QSOM|4.0|This movie is amazing. The special features are captivating - the overlap of historical oil and mineral discovery with the novel &#34;Oil!&#34; and the development of storyboards for the film is a gem. The score is unique, and another notable special feature is hearing it overlayed and uninterrupted in the special features.<br /><br />The packaging, though, is bizarre and unconventional. The material, I fear, will not stand the test of time, and the discs are hardly secure inside their sleeves. A tri-fold opening for a slim, cardboard-type package does not stack well in most libraries or DVD display cases, not does it provide a method for closing the case properly. Seems like a bad decision.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really love both seasons of this show. The first season was Amazon prime for free so I thought I'd try it even if I wasn't a big fan of horror. It was basically love at first sight and from that moment on I was addicted. Then when I was done with season 1, I was skeptical about season 2. But then I saw Jessica Lange as Sister Jude, a super strict and in-charge Nun who runs an asylum for the criminally insane. The musical number is fantastical and amazing. One of my favorite shows. Not for the faint of heart.
B006G7Y7GY|4.0|This is an easy read. There are quite a few hilarious moments ! You can actually picture Ozzy doing all the things he says he's done
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Bossypants was everything I had expected and then some. I am a big fan of Tina Fey and her dry, sarcastic, and blunt sense of humor. While I generally cannot get actively engaged in nonfiction stories, this does not necessarily read like a book. I felt as though Fey was talking directly to me, making me laugh every step along the way. A must read for anyone who likes Tina Fey or for any woman who wants a realistic depiction of Hollywood and life in general.
B000Q76K1A|1.0|We recorded the movie on DVR, when it ended 1/2 hour too soon. Went to Amazon instant on my Vizio TV, tried to register the TV, no luck, tried to go online to fix. After 1/2 on the phone tech was unable to resolve. They refunded my $2.99, put it in my library (said I could watch it on my PC or iPhone) I told them I would wait until I could see it on the TV. They were going to resolve and call back or email a solution. Still have not heard from Amazon, shh don't spoil the ending. Dealing with Amazon Instant Movies is a no action bad drama! 2 thumbs down!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is an excellent book although it will make more sense overall if one has read the first book in the trilogy as many of the characters continue from it.  There is enough material that this is not essential but I think it is an advantage.
B0073XM77G|5.0|This is a darling film that my children and i saw once on PBS years ago.  It became a family favorite- from the inspiring music to the sweet animation - it endears young and old alike.

B008CLI4N4|4.0|Very well done - costume, staging, etc. The actors are great, and I especially like the Imp. I am very glad that I read the book first, otherwise I would be lost as the story line jumps from one kingdom to the next. HBO stays pretty true to the book.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I'll admit, I preordered The Casual Vacancy simply because it was written by J.K. Rowling. Being a self-proclaimed Harry Potter nerd, I expected this book to be another Rowling masterpiece (even though I knew it would be nothing like Potter). I was pretty disappointed when all the negative reviews started rolling in, which made me wish I had waited to see what people were saying about it before I made the purchase. This book was not cheap for a Kindle version! And I was still regretting the purchase once I started reading the book.<br /><br />Now that I have finished The Casual Vacancy, my view has completely changed.<br /><br />This book is divided into parts. It also jumps around between a few different families, meaning there are a lot of different characters. It was a little difficult to keep track of everyone at first, but by the end of Part I, I had it all figured out. Part I got things off to a slow start as seemingly every character around town was either shocked, saddened, or both over the death of Parish Councilor, Barry Fairbrother. And then the beginning of Part II completely lost me with the history of Pagford and Yarvil (the towns in the story) and of course, the Fields. The second half of Part II was when things really picked up and got interesting for me.<br /><br />It became clear very quickly that Rowling was trying to get as far away as possible from family-friendly writing. Between the adult themes and the language, this book is definitely not for the younger set. Each character seemed to have a secret or problem they're struggling with from drugs, an abusive husband/father, an affair, unhappy marriages, etc., all while the town has to reelect a new member to the Parish Council to fill Barry's shoes and make a couple of very important decisions for Pagford, Yarvil, and the Fields.<br /><br />I really fell in love with this story and the characters. Without giving anything alway, I was deeply saddened by the ending and was not expecting it at all.<br /><br />The reason I gave this book four stars was because, as I said, it was slow to start off for me. But once I got deeper into the story, I was hooked. The Casual Vacancy was definitely one of the best books I have read in a while. Highly recommend.<br /><br />The reason I gave this book four stars was because, as I said, it was slow to start off for me. But once I got deeper into the story, I was hooked.

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I am admittedly late to the Bruno Mars party but I am glad to be here. I had seen him perform a few times on TV and always found him interesting.  I accidentally saw him open SNL and I was hooked. Later in that same show I was totally mesmerized when he performed Locked Out of Heaven. His charm kept me watching. Having bought this CD his voice, music and lyrics keep me listening. He is truly talented.<br />As usual Amazon delivered pronto as promised and the merchandise was in pristine condition.

B00000ADG2|5.0|I cant really say enough about this album. Its a masterpiece, a beautiful poetically written gospel. I totally understand what Lauryn Hill is preaching and agree with every word. Its incredible how one person can write and sing all of these resonating songs in such a flawless way. I was born in the 90s and this was what I listening to as a young girl and now I listen to it being much older makes me appreciate it more. If you dont know who Lauryn Hill is, buy this album and listen to it thoroughly. You will have such an appreciation for female singers and rap artists. I listen to this till this day so her work is definitely always relevant :]

1465001107|4.0|This is a very nice calendar as Bravado has again done a good job.  The pictures of Michael  were adequate but in comparison to last year's BAD25 Anniversary calendar this years calendar was somewhat disappointing.  The 2012 calendar was fantastic with huge rare wonderful pictures and many special effects.  Out of five stars I would give the 2012 calendar 10 stars.  The 2013 calendar was adequate but I hope that Bravado will put a little more effort into the one for 1014.

0783114222|1.0|Ordered the listed item: 1998 release with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (the original release). Received instead a set clearly marked as 16:9 with a 2009 copyright. Not an improvement. Disappointing. The conversion to 16:9 simply cut off parts of the original. Not worth the loss. Can order current version of 16:9 release for far less, if that version was what I sought.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Love love love Iron Man movies.  Doesn't disappoint.  Recommend all of the iron man movies and the avengers too. Rent or buy.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Buy it the story lives on. Everyone show have this movie in their library. Every twist and turn keeps you hanging by the edge of your seat.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great stress breaker and very enjoyable and  easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who likes games.
B0090SI42Y|4.0|I'm going to be straight with any and everyone who will read this. The movie is exactly what a fan of 70s Kung Fu should expect. When you watched Dance of The Drunken Mantis, did you expect a story of epic proportions or did you come for Sam Seed and great kung Fu?<br /><br />When you saw Chinese Super Ninjas, did you know the story would be awesome or did you buy it because \\"ninjas\\" was in the title?<br /><br />When you saw Kill Bill, did you go because you know Tarantino was involved even though Uma Thurman was never an action star?<br /><br />The ideas of a kung fu movie are always similar. Revenge, saving someone or a group or village, or facing a rival clan or school.<br /><br />I won't tell the story any more than anyone else, but if you can understand anything i've said so far, believe me that The Man with the Iron Fist is made in this same train of thought. It has a touch of revenge, mixed with the rise of a hero. I think it was well done, though RZA as a lead could've been performed by anyone with the basic abilities. Most surprising was David Batista as Brass Body. He is a very convincing and charasmatic villain, better than all the rest, in my opinion.<br /><br />He played the villain very well.<br /><br />If you don't want to own the movie, fine, but at least watch it once before making a final decision based on an opinion of any other person. Only you can know what you like for certain. I liked this movie, and will buy the movie either on dvd or on digital download. That's what matters to me.
B004Y042N8|4.0|This is a no fuss easy puzzle game to play to waste time. I could be nitpicking and give less stars but for a free app of the day I have no complaints. Yep the menu system could be improved a bit and include some background music to entertain the player also a \\"exit\\" button of some sort would have been nice. But I have seen worse apps with questionable permissions that developers attempt to sell for much higher price. For 99c this a nice time killer app with absolutely no permission issues or questionable advertising  modules. The game play is simple and works well on Kindle fire. There could be some repetitiveness after few minutes of game-play and might get boring for some. But you can always quit this game and play something else and come back fresh and complete some more levels. It does remember where you left so you can start right back up and continue on.<br /><br />Thanks for offering this as FAOTD - Four stars from me.
030759565X|5.0|I am not a good cook but every recipe I've tried so far has come out as if I were a pro!  The book is entertaining as well as full of unique but easy recipes.  Some things I had to try out of curiosity like the popcorn cookies.  They were different but once you get past the first few bites of a cookie because of the strange combination, you'll want another one.  I highly recommend it!
B007N9FKCY|3.0|Actually quite entertaining scroll-er game. It has nice smooth graphics and is quite challenging at times. The music is pleasing to listen to. If you are into retro style scrolling games you will love this one.<br /><br />The game was attempted on the Original Kindle fire and Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet and the controls works great. It is a nice time killer and is fun to see Bean jumping up and down. Definitely worth the price if you love Retro style scrolling games.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|It had ads and I could not delete them.  It should not be sold as ad free.  I will purchase directly from Rovio.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent and addictive!  Very challenging and well worth the cost.  Keeps your brain thinking, great cerebral exercise!  You will love this game :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was amazing full of great quotes my new favorite book<br />It was absolutely incredible I would definitely recommend it
B009GED3HS|5.0|I can't stop saying &#34;Dammit Patrice!!&#34; I love this show and I love the way this season played out - can't wait for the next one :D
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I got it from offthewall. the discs were brand new but disc one had disc 2s content on it. So I wasn't happy about that but its not their fault, and he refunded my money. Buy from them!
B00ARAO720|2.0|I was pretty disappointed with this movie. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt's recent successes in movies I was hoping this one would be just as good. Unfortunately it is an extreme let down. This movie seemed like a grown up version of a Disney Channel Original movie. I thought this movie had to deal with some sort of top secret message that could ruin Wall street or something, but instead it is just an envelope of money that a friend needs to get to a lady so she can pay for her son to come from China to America :/ Really, that's the plot....it's so lame. However, the biking parts of the movie were very entertaining; it's not everyday you see a high speed chase on a bike. So if you do end up renting this movie, I suggest that you just watch the whole thing on mute. Believe me you will save yourself a lot of disappointment.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a great game to play and makes you think about every move. I like the &ccedil;olors they used to make it.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl Streep is a great actress in this movie.<br />She had me laughing so hard, I cried.<br />Everybody should see this film! It is hillariest.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I am not a person that enjoys reading.  A friend suggested this book to me.  It is an easy read and right up my alley since I am an animal lover.  I would suggest it to anyone that is considering it.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|We absolutely loved the songs on the CD.  I'm looking forward to viewing all that goes on in the new season.
B00873GRU4|5.0|ok so I bought a kindle novel from an unfamiliar author. I actually read the first \\"Look inside\\" and got hooked inside! I thoroughly enjoyed this book, my only real criticsm, is that it is part of series, but I'm confused about what to read next as this book was labelled a Trilogy (books 1-5), and then there are First Shift, Second Shirt, a silo series... and to be honest I'm a bit lost... I want more more more, but not sure what book is the next course in my meal! would welcome assistance with this btw! :)
B007P6VM04|4.0|Enjoyed the series on TV; the CD was good and we are looking forward to the new season of music!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 2.5 son loves this app.  Bought this one because he loved Dr. Panda's Hospital so much & this one is just as fun!  Highly recommend!
0743270754|4.0|Team of Rivals :Hoping to add more to my knowledge of our 16 th president in addition to seeing the movie.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is so worth the money.  My son loves to pretend he's a doctor & this app give him lots of choices, is easy for him to do, and he loves earning the &#34;special things&#34; every few animals that he fixes.
B0050R0XEG|4.0|A good set but.....3 pieces were missing and we had 22 extra pieces. Yes, we followed instructions very carefully...for example, we had two gear shift levers and two green leafy plant thingees.  The BOM calls for one each although truly one cannot have enough green leafy thingees.  Missing pieces works out to 2,269 PPM which would not necessarily be a World Class automaker :)  Throw in the extra pieces and you are at 18,685 PPM ....  OMG!!! This is a VW not a GM.  With all that said Lego customer service is very easy to use.  just order missing pieces on line.  We had to wait about two weeks for Denmark delivery.  For the actual assembly, we found the leading roof edge assembly very dodgy.  Once assembled and installed, hard to keep it in one piece due to questionable underside structural support (No dear, we are NOT going to glue it in place).  Fan belt alignment on motor assembly also a bit questionable.  You'd be shredding belts left and right on your real van if you had this alignment.  Otherwise assembly very good, very easy, very time consuming.
B009LY72LQ|5.0|These make up just like the boxed dolls...lots of fun.  Only thing, there needs to be two wigs and two pair of shoes....one for each doll created.  My granddaughter loved these.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Enjoyable, easy read that would be perfect for the beach - in fact was perfect for the beach. Would recommend
B004GJYROG|2.0|bad Quality.. it was fine to still watch it and its not HORRIBLE but the quality and resolution isnt the best
0525953728|5.0|Tom loved the book and is going to read it again to get all the details he might of missed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an amazing book. I absolutely loved it. I read the whole series. I wish there were more books.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I have always loved Seth's stuff, but lately been waning on the same old schtick.  Best buddies for ever... until the hot chick gets in the way... so lets screw it up....then make up
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Each new video and song i s a new experience that makes your day!  These guys truly have a gift and know how to share it with people of all ages, backgrounds, cultures, etc.  Their music crosses all genre's and the video knows no boundaries.  These guys are proof that if you can dream something, you can live that dream!  Keep it up guys!
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Do not waste your money.  We really liked the resident evil shows, this one is aweful.  No story at all.  I think they were only trying to see how much carnage they could accomplish in 90 minutes.  I think they inserted the human actors into a video game.  Bad ....really bad!
0988262592|5.0|As someone who works in the IT industry, but has never actually worked in IT, The Phoenix Project is an eye-opening glimpse into the dark underbelly of IT Operations. Gene Kim describes how compounding technical debt, fragile systems, and pressure from the business to deploy faster create a downward spiral of despair for IT professionals. Although the characters are fictional, they feel very real: We all know that beleaguered sysadmin or IT manager who is under-staffed, under-supported, and constantly in fire-fighting mode. Thankfully, there is a better way, but you'll have to read the novel yourself to find out.
B007R21JJK|5.0|For those saying the USB ports dont work at first, that is correct. Only two will.<br />Because you dont have the drivers installed. When you install them, like you should, it works great.<br /><br />Great build quality. Great looks. Overall great board.<br />Detected RAM and ran it at the correct frequency the first time. No problems.<br /><br />I would DEFINITELY recommend this to others.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use. Fast loading. Convenient.<br />It could be a bit easier to create a pin on a mobile device though. Needs a pin button.<br />I enjoy the tile method of selecting a board to look at.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is great. when I paid for the 200k more coins; it never showed up. I hope I can get my money back. no other issues
080508990X|5.0|This is one of the best children's books ever! My 2 year old wants me to read this book 20 times a day. I highly recommend it!
B00991TCOG|5.0|a very good music on this cd, always the same quality like we love from this artist. I enjoy to buy this cd, because it's not sell in france . . .
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|MY ALARM CLOCK APPLICATION is wonderful.Not only does it give the time and several alarms,but white noise incase your like myself and need a little noise Togo to sleep. The quality on the free version  is easy for anyone to use. Thank you
B001UV4XIS|5.0|It is the end of the story. The end of many things. No spoilers here, but very dark, and very sad.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this light is a very bright light..and yes i would recommend it to anyone that needs a bright light..nice and bright...
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not necessarily my favorite Nicholas Sparks book, however it kept me interested with every page. I would recommend it to anyone.
B005544V6A|4.0|I enjoyed all the episodes and was a little worried that it wouldn't survive longer than one season. It is fun to watch, the show sometimes seem to drag on, but it is still fun and entertaining to watch.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|I watch this every year around Thanksgiving.  It's moving and fun, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it!
B009329Y30|3.0|Yes, a movie that is exactly what you would expect. A pure chick flick with pretty people and a sweet ending delivered in a bow. Nice with a bottle of wine and your girlfriends.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|There's very little not to like about this movie.  It's witty and action packed.  Not a great thinking movie, but wonderful to sit down and watch with a family.
B003L77G10|5.0|Like all great critiques they say the show is great and I agree. I was reluctant at first to watch the show. It just seemed like another legal drama that run on for longer than it should and drag with the writing and plot lines becoming more and more absurd.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I knew nothing of this book but that it was a classic and thought, \\"I should read it.\\" I thoroughly enjoyed it and intend to read more classics that I should have years ago.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Birthday gift for a friend and he absolutely loves it. Great set to add to his collection. Loves all the extras!
B008476HBM|5.0|One of the best romances in the world of literature. Every woman wants a Mr Darcy although in the BBC adaptation I actually preferred Bingley ;)
B00A17AD36|5.0|Almost every track is good on thirty songs, was shocked to see the artists he has worked with and he still had'nt been known till now
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I love both Persuasion & Pride & Prejudice equally. They are my favourites of her work. I will continue to re-read them
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cannot begin to express the emotions flowing through me after reading this book. I knew this would be a good read, just based on the author alone, but never did I expect to feel so breathless and in complete awe when it was all said and done. I loved Sky's character bcuz she wasn't like any 17 year old, she was wise beyond her years and carried herself well with a witty and sarcastic attitude with still such a warm and forgiving heart. Holder was with a doubt my favorite. The love he had for Sky was the most powerful love that I got to experience in any book and they were only 17 and 18. The truth about Sky's past is what broke my heart, bcuz it felt like I was readin about someones actual life versus a book that's based on fictional characters. It just felt so real and it took everything in me not cry right there on the train in front of everyone (yea, I was readin on the train). But it was Holder's ability to lover her with everything he had, that eased the sadness I felt for Sky. The book talks about serious issues that deal with rape and suicide. Issues that are very hard to face and no matter how much we may want to over look it, they will still be there and I cannot appreciate Collene Hoover enough for being brave enough to wright about a subject that is so sensitive. I felt it was written with so much taste and sensitivity without overwhelming the reader. I can go on forever with this book bcuz it was just that good. It broke my heart, warmed my heart, stole my heart and took my breath away.  MUST MUST READ PPL!!!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|What can you say about Harry and his friends that haven't been said!!!!  Enjoyed the whole series of films and are sad to see them done.  At least Voldemort was taken care of!!!!
B005T87QCI|4.0|got this app because of both reviews and movie but every time i open it it asks formore data hit yes then nothing but title screen, but still going to call it epic though never played it
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I enjoyed the books so was glad that they stuck as closely to the books as they did.  Cant wait for the next movie
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always, another great book from Flynn with twists, turns, suspense and plenty of Rapp to keep you from wanting to put it down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What i like about this game is after you have played it all, you can go to settings and re-set and play again with new scores. And best of all it is free!!!!!
