0545305497|5.0|Books arrived in a timely fashion & were in great shape; however, Grandson borrowed all 3, had an incident on his motorcycle, lost the 1st 2, & now I only have the 3rd one to read.  Boo-hoo.  Not sellers bad, tho.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|When I first got the app, it was soo much fun. Perfect. Would have given it five stars, however, after I advanced significantly in the game, it began to have major glitches. Wait times would be about 150 hours. I decided to wait it out the first time, but when it got close to zero hours, it reset back to 150 hours, this time including all the buildings I had built after the timer took a crape and all the animals and plants. I uninstalled the app shortly after.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So after listening to the news shows call these books shocking and Mom Porn....I decided that I needed to download these books and see what all the fuss was about. Granted the grammer is not that good...but the story line and the characters are FANTASTIC. The author does a good job getting us wrapped up in Ana and Christian that we are rooting for them all the way through the book. I did NOT want to like Christian, but for whatever reason I really like him. The press said these books are so shocking and that libraries are not carrying them...WHAT??? My goodness I have read more hard core sex scenes in historical novels. Yes these are NOT Christian Fiction books....but shocking...no. What these are is a great trilogy of a great romance story. I have no idea what all the fuss is about. If you want to lose yourself in a great romance story for a few hours...yes these are the book for you. If you want a great Literature Read...not so much. If you want to learn about sex...get a how to guide...the sex is here is a little rauchy but not as bad as the press makes it seem. I give this author a 5 Star for a great Love Story.
B006XIR9KM|2.0|played it once and enjoyed it.  tried to play again and it didn't work.  the screen would freeze and the start button was not responsive... removed from kindle.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of puzzle games but I really like this one. Give it a shot! That's about it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I don't like how you run out of energy so fast but other than that it's a fun game! I loved Oregon trail as a kid.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|My grandson was the one to tell me about this exciting booK. I enjoyed reading the book and have started the second book. Can't wait to see what happens next. At first I didn't think it was a good subject for my 10 year old but changed my opinion as I read the book. I plan to see the movie and will go with my grandson to see it....it will be the second time he has seen it. I gave him a Kindle for christmas....I encourage reading with all my grandchildren
044042321X|5.0|I watched this on HBO and wanted to read the set. A great read, I highly recommend these books. I can't wait for next one out.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I love Mahjong, but this deluxe game does not seem to be too deluxe.  Only four levels to chose and 40 within each, it should have more.  I have gone through each one and all I have left to do is go back and try to get 3 stars and a better time.  The game could show you the time to beat when going back to play that level again. I guess I just have to remember what is was when I play each level again, otherwise, it is a fun puzzle/brain game to play.
0439023491|4.0|1) Rating: 4 out of 5<br /><br />2) Genre: Young Adult/Dystopia<br /><br />3) Synopsis: Katniss and Peeta somehow survived the Hunger Games and are now home victors. Will the Capital let them grow old and live in peace? Or will the Capital look to punish Katniss for defying them and giving the districts hope.<br /><br />4) Feelings: I have come to the realization if you liked the Hunger Games you like it for one of three reasons. 1) It has a wonderful love story and the action of the games. 2) It has a wonderful love story and you put up with the action of the games. 3) It has a love story that you can ignore and the actions of the games.<br /><br />I am the third.  I really didn't care about the love story at all.  Whether Katniss ended up with Peeta or Gale meant nothing to me.  I loves Hunger Games for the games themselves.  Sure it was bloody but it was filled with action and suspense.<br /><br />If you want the games you will struggle with this book some.  Sure there are games but they don't set foot in the arena until you are 60% into the book.  That's a whole lot of the book talking about not killing other people.<br /><br />5) Final recommendation: I didn't enjoy this one anywhere nearly as much as I did the Hunger Games.  It was still interesting and you care about the characters but it doesn't invoke the same emotions as the first book did.  Although I imagine if you liked it for reason 1 or 2 you probably liked this book more than I did.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|Great knife, especially for the price at the time ($30 for a gold deal), sadly the stitching on the belt loop of the case came apart within a week - which results in a lost knife thats why I gave it 3stars
B004LWZW7Y|3.0|I was never one of the Puss In Boots fans when he made his debut in \\"Shrek 2\\". But ever since I rediscovered the Shrek movies, I fell in love with all the characters all over again, especially the cute kitty with the sexy Spanish accent. So I saw the DVD of his movie being sold, and, having not seen it in the theatres, I decided to give it a try. And I'm glad I did, because it's an entertaining funny film.<br />But when comparing it to Shrek, it kind of looks much worse than it does on its own. There were several parts of the movie that just weren't interesting. However, there is one highlight in the movie, involving one of the new principal characters:<br />Kitty Softpaws. She's the love interest in this movie, and she is fantastic! Her character is so smart and sassy that every girl admires her, and my favourite parts of the movie by far are the times she takes Puss' stuff: His boots, his money, his hat...it's just funny to watch her take all this stuff without him even noticing.<br />The story is OK, but nothing special. Maybe there are a few twists, and the end is good, but in my opinion, it's hard not to switch the movie off right in the middle.<br />But I still recommend it, if you can get it cheap. It's worth a few watches, and if you've gotten through the first 45 minutes, keep watching, cause it improves.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Better than Oregon Settlers since there's no energy limit. Plus there's a chance to find or earn acorns so you can complete the game without spending money.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|i loved playing this game so much on my sons kindle fire that i purchased it for my Asus Transformer Prime tablet.  Well sad to say that it doesn't work on my device.  If it did, I would've rated it a 5.  WTB an update plz.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie was clever and hilarious. Being a native West Virginian I expected the usual stereotypical hillbilly horror flick, but was pleasantly surprised. Very entertaining. The main characters are believable and rather lovable.
B001993Y3G|5.0|I love Kevin Costner in this movie. This version of Robin Hood is my favorite out of all the Robin Hoods.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|its fun but you cant seem to visit ur friends villages without constantly restarting the game!! fix that and ill rate better!
B006RUJST6|5.0|You know how many hours of sleep I got last night?  TWO!!!  Want to know why?  It was because I was \\"Slammed.\\"  This book will grab your attention from the very beginning.  You will not be able to put it down; you will not want to put it down.  It is a rollercoaster ride of emotion.  You will find yourself laughing and crying out loud....fist pumping \\"YES\\" and punching your pillow screaming \\"NO.\\"  This is a very, very well written story of heartache, love, and how one overcomes challenges in life.  The poetry is amazing and the provided lyrics of the Avett Brothers are uplifting.  My only regret with this book, that I didn't \\"butterflying\\" purchase it sooner.  I loved being \\"Slammed!!!!\\"
B007PTJOV0|5.0|like super Mario world but on the go. fun and easy even for kids to play. great for killing time and boredom. Awesome on Kindle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book, although I wouldn't recommend it to children. Great for sci-fi fans. The character development was also very good, which goes further in the last two books.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very fun game. Similar to farmville but with ice age characters. just started playing it and I am hooked
B000K7UBTI|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. I thought it told the story rather well. The animation used CGI for a few parts, mainly covering the suits. Tony is a bit of a jerk at the beginning, but he comes around. I thought it had a good ending.
1400069289|5.0|This is not an easy book to describe because Charles Duhigg offers such a wealth of information in so many different areas. For example:<br /><br />o  What a habit is...and isn't<br />o  What the habit loop is and does<br />o  How and why we form good and bad habits<br />o  Why it is so difficult to sustain good habits and so easy to sustain bad ones<br />o  Which external influences most effectively manipulate both good and bad habits<br />o  How to defend good habits<br />o  How to break bad habits<br />o  How and why our habits reveal our values<br /><br />In Part One, Duhigg focuses on how habits emerge within individual lives; in the next, he examines the habits of successful companies and organizations; and then in Part Three, he looks at the habits of societies. \\"We now know why habits emerge, how they change, and the science behind their mechanics. We know how to break them into parts and rebuild them to our specifications. We know how to make people eat less, exercise more, work more efficiently, and live healthier lives. Transforming a habit isn't necessarily easy or quick. It isn't always simple. But it is possible. And now we know why.\\" Also how.<br /><br />There in a brief passage is the essence of what motivated Duhigg to write this book and also perhaps, just perhaps, a sufficient reason for people who read it to then rebuild their habits to their expectations, based on what they have learned from the book.<br /><br />One of  Duhigg's most valuable insights (among the several dozen he shares) is that organizations as well as individuals can develop bad habits or allow them to develop. For example, tolerating incivility and thus condoning it, conducting performance evaluations unfairly and/or inconsistently, and under-valuing employees and/or customers. However, in that event, only individuals can break those organizational bad habits and only if their habits are equal to that challenge. Duhigg devotes all of Part Two (Chapters 4-7) an explanation of how best to respond to that challenge. Stephen Covey also has much of value to say about what meeting that challenge requires of people in his classic, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change.ow best to respond to that challenge. Stephen Covey also has much of value to say about what meeting that challenge requires of people in his classic, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change.
B0000844I8|5.0|I bought this from Amazon but I do not think it was the Ultimate Edition.<br /><br />This is, hands down, a great film. Lots of action and sci-fi interests. I really like this film.
0385491026|4.0|Elaine prefers to be called a painter rather than an artist and is in Toronto for a retrospective of her work.  This novel is a retrospective of her life, which was happy until her family moved there while she and her brother Stephen were children.  Her parents are a bit nebulous and beyond eccentric.  Her father is an entomologist who settles his family in Toronto when he takes a college teaching job.  After a nomadic life in motels and campgrounds prior to that point, Elaine is not equipped for girl stuff and pays a very high price for acceptance by her so-called friends, led by the enigmatic Cordelia.  (Mean Girls would be an appropriate title for this book.)  We know from the beginning that Elaine will make it to adulthood, but it's touch and go for a while, and I kept wondering what pivotal event was going to turn the tide for her.  There certainly is one, and although she struggles out of more than one destructive relationship, she never comes across as really triumphant or even very confident, despite her success.  This is due largely to unfinished business with Cordelia, and Atwood seems to make the point that sometimes resolution has to come from the peace we make with ourselves.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I originally purchased this on VCD a few years ago just to see the animation, but the story is so well done that I still put it on a couple of times a year.  It isn't often that you see an animated film with a good story and a great moral point to go with it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|They just gave a new update today don't get me wrong its great but once I went to the new dinosaur village all of my dinosaurs are gone from ice age and now I have to buy them again I have spent a lot of real money on this game and had a couple of the families complete I don't want to have to buy them again ive been playing this game since it came out and don't want to have to get rid of it please fix this
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I wanted this movie by Whitney Houston for some time.  I love all the song numbers so when she passed I decided to buy it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is so much fun. I had a blast playing it! If you are interested, it's definitely worth it!
B000MGTQ84|5.0|Sadly, we may never again see its like, given the types of films made today. The incredible attack on Aqaba is like actually watching history unfold. An amazing achievement. And the writing is first rate. It's really hard to get any better: the script is literate, profound, and sometimes devastating. Part 1 is probably better than Part 2, but it's hard to quibble here, not with the amazing cinematography and scenery, the timeless score, the star-making performance of Peter O'Toole, and the rest of the stellar cast. I believe the AFI ranked it as their number 3 film of all time, and it's not hard to see why.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so addictive I love it. super. cute. animals I love ice age movies. yay yay woot yay yay yay yay yay
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game until one day I opened it and the whole thing had been time reset. it told me that the next time I would get energy was in 233 hours. I had to delete it. please fix this!
B000068OCS|5.0|This movie is something that everyone should see, if only once.  It is a 'bucket list' kind of movie.  One of the greatest, and most beautiful works of video art ever.  And you should really watch the extra video interview with the director as well as the man responsible for the soundtrack.  I find it interesting that so many people 'read' some specific message into this movie.  And Mr. Fricke clearly states he had no motives, no real message, no POV that he was trying to push.  It is just Art, and as such it means whatever you want it to.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great time passer. Exactly what you expect. No bugs, just a great program. I would suggest anyone thinking of a solitaire download, getting this one!
B002PNAY9C|5.0|When starting the Inheritance Cycle I read a ton of reviews that said that Paolini stole from authors like Tolkien and even the great director George Lucas. This provokes a sense of mystery in me. As I read the entire series, sure, I saw how these great creators had \\"influenced\\" Paolini, but I never saw evedence of plagiarism. My point being...don't let the haters spoil your experience with this series.<br /><br />On to the book. I loved the character development, plot, and the non story book endings. Once I started Eragon I literally could not put the books down. Paolini set the hook, reeled me in, netted me, and took me to the taxidermist! I was effectivly a trophy that reminds him of another satisfied reader.<br /><br />I highly suggest this series to anyone and everyone!<br /><br />To Christopher Paolini, I hope that you continue to write incredible storys that we as readers can't put down!
B0047685I2|2.0|I love this movie, I would give it 5 stars if I was just rating the movie.  However, this review is for the quality of the Blu Ray. It went on sale and I was very happy I was going to be able to replace my DVD copy.  As soon as I started watching it I realized the quality was possibly even worse than my DVD.  I would have to play them side by side to make an accurate assessment.  The picture was grainy and in some spots blurry.  The other odd thing was in scenes where Leonardo is wearing a white hat, there is a double halo/shadow effect going on.  When there is a scene with bright light (for example any outdoor scene) the entire shot is blown out. When it's dark, the black is grainy with no crispness whatsoever. I literally felt like I was watching an old VCR edition. This movie is so beautifully shot and such a wonderful story I am so disappointed the blu-ray didn't live up to my expectations.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was a great read. It felt like walking into an enchanted dream. She tells the story of two people whose lives are determined by a single game. It isn't an ordinary game either, because in this game, they are the pieces and the circus is their game field. Celia Bowen and her opponent Marco Alisdair are illusionists, real ones too. They are to live their lives playing this game until there is a successor, but they don't have a clue as to how to win.<br />Erin has the ability to create wonderful images in your mind and it shows especially when she writes about the circus scenes and its tents. I was able to see each tent, costume, person, detail, and every bit of magic she wrote about. For example, \\"Starting at the neckline and seeping down like ink, the green silk is turning a murky, midnight black. -the creeping black fade into a snow-bright white at the bottom of the skirt, until all evidence that the gown was ever green is gone. Celia shakes her head and her brown curls deepen in hue to a near black, as glossy and ebony as the wings of her raven.\\"<br />As you read along through the book, you realize that Celia and Marco's relationship develop into a sweet love story. The only down side to that was that we all knew it was forbidden for them to be together and would only make the game more difficult.<br />One point I loved the most was that the author had made the setting take place in the 1800's through the 1900's. The dialogue wasn't very old. It sounded very ordinary like everyday speech. But you could still sense it being from the past. It seemed as though I was looking into a flashback.<br />Love, suspense, and a magical twist of fate.<br /><br />Sorry if that was long and kinda cheesy. I had to write a book review for a class I had and I got a perfect grade on it so I decided to share. What I wrote was true though this book was a really good and well written. I would say it is worth your time. I might read it twice actually.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|But really if you have a kindle fire use the alarm on that works much better this is quiet and drains your battery
B007N5YIUS|1.0|This app doesnt work at all on android powered coby kyros tablet! The other version of angry birds like seasons does. I tried downloading few times nothing when I click on shortcut it flips black screen freezes then goes back my home screen! SUCKS!

B0000VCZK2|5.0|The value of this collection depends largely on whether you are the kind of person who thinks that seeing behind the scenes of a movie adds a layer of appreciation, rather than detracts from enjoyment.  While I am no fan of director's cuts or deleted scenes, camera test footage is an entirely different matter.  Although there isn't a lot of it here, what there is, is primo.  Example: footage of a dog in an alien costume (I kid you not, see the extra's for Alien 3). Another example: footage of the queen when she was little more than foam blocks and trash bags.<br /><br />Although there is a ton of talking head footage, together they compare and contrast with each other, Rashomon-like.  Many of the people connected with the film are speaking candidly: the interviews for Alien 3 clearly acknowledge that they are telling a story of how not to make a movie.<br /><br />Then there are the oft-told tales which you may think you know but are told in more depth by more people: the first chestburster scene in Alien is a prime example.  The legend that the actors didn't know it was going to happen at all is pure fiction, but the real details are even better.  There are also actor interviews which emphasize how rigorous production can be, and by this I mean more than 12 hours days and unheated sound stages.  Apparently these films depended on a lot of fresh meat byproducts, which smelled bad upon delivery and only got worse with time.  And not only was the underwater sequence in Resurrection both taxing and potentially dangerous: Winona Ryder has some very interesting things to say about the condition of the water in the pool, dug on the Fox lot specifically for the film.  Cast and crew spent a month in that water, which wasn't changed, ever.<br /><br />Also fascinating is the fact that the special effects in Alien were highly dependent on existing low-tech of the day, while the fourth had over a hundred CG effects.  Frankly, I didn't understand everything the effects people were saying, but no matter: there are miniatures and puppets galore, all lovingly crafted and with more details than you'd ever pick up upon first viewing of the films themselves.  All the directors save Fincher are interviewed at length on how and why they made the artistic choices they did.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the packaging of the nine discs gets to be like unfolding a gas station map, and by the time you get to disc nine there is little you haven't already heard in the previous four extras discs, each of which contains multiple navigation screens to move between pre-production, production and post-production. It takes a little getting used to, but once you do you have a number of options as to what and how to view the documentary and archival items.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|after reading so many Stephen King and Dean Koontz books, I was seeking something with a similar edge, but a little different.  I found it in this book.  Kept me interested from first page to the last.  Very interesting.  Give thisbook a try.  I'd love a movie adaptation.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a good game but my youngest 4 year old brother bought acorns for 1.99 but it is a good game.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|I really enjoyed this game!! I love any kind of memory game and I must admit this one is one of a kind.  I love the smooth and colorful tiles and with how they are moving all around to keep you on your toes.  Highly recommend this game! played on Kindle Fire.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Decent way to spend some time. My son loves the familiar characters. As far as the issue for closing the app on the kindle, just go to options and the home Icon appears. great free game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addictive &amp; engaging! Enjoyed the game, the beautiful design &amp; calming music! Liked it so much I have replayed many levels over. Also liked the hint option.

B0063IH60K|5.0|best solitaire game that I have seen. love the graphics when I win. highly recommend this game to any body.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|you people need to get over the charges. yeah, you can pay to get stuff, or you don't have to! and stop letting your kids play on apps you haven't checked out! don't be idiots and beg for refunds either, you deserve to have kids ruin your finances if you can't handle looking over a game for five seconds! this is actually a really fun game if you bother to wait the five minutes to accomplish anything.
0545265355|5.0|This series was awesome. I read the books in less than four days. My only disappointment is that there is not another book! I could not put these books down. I have not seen the movie yet, because I know the books are always better than the movie. I have heard the Hunger Games was pretty close to the book, but they did leave out some information. I highly recommend these books!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool and very fun. I reccomend this game to others. this game is great and fun for teenagers like me
B006XIR9KM|5.0|Doesn't invade your privacy, exits cleanly, and moves to sd card. Got a little bored with it after a little while, but works well for when you have a few minutes to kill.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Very well written, but couldn't get past the 'child sacrifice as sport' premise of the whole book. Unlike others, I'm not going to read the next two books.
B00005JM02|5.0|I purchased Finding Nemo for my great-niece and it was in excellent shape. It arrived sooner than predicted, which was wonderful because I promised to take it to her house on a certain day. As advertised the case was a little bit damaged. That was no problem, she is three, so to her its whats inside that counts. Fair deal for a popular movie.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|Saw a lot of positive reviews and decided to give it a go. Frustrating and fun at the same time. Watch for those darn moving tiles. They throw in an extra bit of frustration. Great job dev!

Each page includes commentary about why designs were chose, discarded or changed and how the decisions would shape the form of the game series through its conclusion in Mass Effect 3.<br /><br />Aspiring artists, fans of the series and those who are interested in what goes on behind the scenes at major production companies will be enthralled by the beautiful artwork and compelling storytelling.<br /><br />As I am a fan of the series, and BioWare in particular, and an artist I found this book enlightening and educational. I went page to page and before I knew it I was through and starting over. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />This book was provided by the publisher as a review copy.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|loved it...until my game added 60 hours to all of my resource times.  but that glitch ruined the game.  sad.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|was impressed with the responsiveness, graphics and sound. fun game. only thing I could suggest is it fades to bright and is a little hard to see, but I guess that adds to the challenge.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is awesome wish it would get a lot more bonus levels and new bad guys to fight off
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I especially love all the different devotions on this app. They have been a wonderful source of information and inspiration in my life. When I am studying the Bible it is also helpful to have many versions of the Bible at my fingertips to look up verses.

I have just begun and am about 1/4 the way through.  I have found it better than I expected. It takes you back and forth between to very different times...from modern day and back to the time when Jews were persecuted. I do recommend this as a book to read. It is in the voice of the young lady who with her family was taken from their home and forced into a \\"stadium\\" with 100s-1000s other Jewish families.

B005OCFHHK|2.0|This box set not only is the worst box set I have every bought but it is for my favorite series, which made it even more dissapointing. They take scenes OUT of the movies, that played in the theatrical version, and put them in deleted scenes. You have no option to play with deleted scenes or the theatrical version. The cover art on the CDs is the exact same as the CDs from the individual released movies. They just threw it together to make some money for christmas. They are releasing a better collection set version later this year and I would save your money for that!
B000XTLUW0|5.0|This is a great set to have for Muse lovers, but it will not play on US DVD/Blu-Ray Players...It did however play on my computer, which wasn't as great b/c my TV screen is much bigger, alas, Muse is Muse is Muse...it was a great buy even tho I can only watch it on my computer.

B0000028UK|4.0|Pearl Jam's follow up to there classic debut 'Ten', The cd, 'VS', is louder, but still a good follow up.<br /><br />  The songs, 'Daughter', and 'Eldery woman behind a counter, in a small town', are classics.<br /><br />  Thease songs are more angry and agressive. Songs like 'WMA','Leash', 'Rats', are angrier than songs on 'Ten'.<br /><br />  The song 'Blood',is a screaming loud mess. that i do not like.<br />  In general 'VS', is louder then 'Ten'. However I still like it.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|Gameplay is good, responsive.  Futuristic-type font could use a little work to make it more readable.  Kudos for the backspace key that functions as an exit \\"button\\" that actually shuts the app down and doesn't keep it in the background.  Music/sound can be turned on/off.  Has a number of options to include an untimed mode (always a plus).<br /><br />Minus a star, though, for leaving the Admob and Adsense in the app, as well as the Google Play licensing.  Maybe it wasn't worth the trouble for the developer to take them out, since the only other versions of this game on both Amazon and Play are free and ad-supported, as well as needing the Google license added for Play.  The problem with dual licensing in one version is that when you now go to Play to see a list of apps you (supposedly) downloaded from THAT market, you will see this app in your list of \\"purchased\\" apps, and also see the app listed on your Amazon list of puchased apps.  However, you do NOT have a true \\"functioning\\" license on Play that could enable you to UPDATE it on Play, nor RATE the app on Play.  I find that irritating to have apps I didn't PURCHASE on Play to be LISTED on Play just because the developer added the Google licensing protection in the app that really had no business being there if the AMAZON license was correctly in the app as required.  It causes confusion when you go to Play, look at your long list of \\"purchased\\" apps, and not know which of those apps you could UPDATE there (or rate) until you click on each of them to see if the rating button is missing (which means you purchased it elsewhere, and good luck remembering where you purchased it).<br /><br />Admob and Adsense are the reasons for the free versions' net access, network state (to see if the user is connected to the net), and external storage access (possibly to write error logs to the SD, if not other unscrupulous reasons to consider).  But both of these are still inside the app, and can't function without the permissionsthe developer removed to create this PAID version.<br /><br />Still, it's nice to know the developer created a zero-permissions app, but for a price of a couple of dollars, which is perfectly fair.  If in the future, however, any internet, network, or storage permissions are added on an update (for other bells and whistles as the claim), I would say delete it (or don't update) because being PERMISSION FREE is the only reason folks would have paid $1.99 for this app in the first place.<br /><br />Just watch out for future updates, but download and enjoy this app today while it's free of permissions and cost!  It really IS a fun, more \\"adult\\" version of the classic match-it games usually designed for kids!  (And you won't get caught playing some cartoon zoo-animal-type matching game at the airport!)
B0079XNWQA|5.0|If you are hoping that this album has all the quick tempo and lyrical twists that you are accustomed to from Jason, it's not.  I still like it and would buy it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Common critique I've read is that the lyrics are very simplified.  Other than the track 'You Fckn Did It', I'd agree that the tempo of this album is much slower from previous albums.  Although the upbeat tempo may not be there, I can still hear the passion Jason always has when he sings.  That in my opinion is more important than tricky lyrics and him putting out what some fans expect him to put out.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have been playing this game for a few minutes and its fun<br />Love this game awesome job you should get this game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is a really cute take on the movie. I love how the theater really plays a movie. I have not been able to put it down since i have installed it. This game does not lock you in like others claim! Its not hard to figure out how to get out either. Just click on settings and the arrow will pop upat the bottom!
B001DF68MA|5.0|I received this WeeRide LTD Kangaroo bike seat and had it out of the box and installed on my Schwinn cruiser bike in probably 45 minutes or so.  The tools that are 'needed' to install the seat come with it however I used an open end wrench and a screwdriver with a allen wrench/hex tip which seemed to make the job a little easier than using the small wrench that is provided.  If you don't have these tools not to worry...install should still be easy with the provided tools.  The seat seems VERY sturdy when installed and I'm sure my daughter will LOVE it when we go for our first ride later today.  My only complaint is a very minor one.  Once you install the bar that the seat sits on and then place the seat onto the bar, you can only move the seat forwards and backwards about two inches or so.  This will put my daughter perhaps a little closer to the handlebars then I'd like but I think it won't be a problem and will still work great for us.  The materials seem like very good quality.  Not a whole lot of cushion/padding (1/2 inch or so) in the seat pad and the head rest area but this shouldn't be a problem so long as we don't go for extremely long rides.  The harness seems to be good quality and is easily adjustable.  I hope to get a couple of great years and many great memories out of this seat!  I'd definitely recommend it!!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I think this is the best Mission Impossible so for.  Very entertaining.  Great cast and plot.  I'd highly recommend it.
0545265355|5.0|the hardcover boxed set is a great value for the price.they are nicely packaged in a display box. our 12 year old loves the series
B0018BF1KY|5.0|I first heard Rory Gallagher on Deep Tracks on XM/Sirius radio, I was so impressed I was on Amazon.com that day purchasing the CD that had the song I heard (\\"Messin' With the Kid\\"). I have since purchased about three other CD's of his. This set is well worth it, price and quantity. There are actually five CD's in this set, five Rory CD's for a little more than $20.00. Need I say more? I won't pretend I know a lot about the sound or the songs,some are more pleasing to my ears and played more than others, but all display his talent. This is especially good if you are like me and never even knew of him before (he died of liver complications in 1995 after a transplant; that alcohol ... it takes its toll). Good addition to a collector of excellent guitar work.
0345803507|5.0|I was told about these books through a friend and I was excited because they were said to mirror the Twilight books. I could see some of the similarities. I also could compare this to Pride And Prejudice. Christian is dark ad mysterious not to mention he is very rich just like Darcy and Edward. Ana's character is so much like Elizabeth because she brings this light into Christian's life which s mentioned throughout. She is oppinionated and hard to control just like Elizabeth. Hell, Ana was even a virgin when Christian met her. I loved every book in the series.<br /><br />  I loved how she molded her characters and had them blossom throughout the series. The relatinship took a crazy fast turn at the end of book two and in this one we get to see the pair as man and wife. The two go on a fantasy honeymoon and all our couples go together on a trip and more suprises happen there between C&A as well teir friends. The Epilogue to the book was so sweet and really brought everything together. I truly hated the books to end but she took the characters as far as she could. I would recommend these books to anyone who gets into romance,suspense type books but I will say if you don't like books with a lot (book porn) of graphic, erotic sex this would not be something you'd enjoy.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|this movie is plat out awesome. Every second has you on the edge of your seat and there are so many characters that have so much action its just amazing from beginning to end.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I use it occasionally on the Kindle Fire using Wi-Fi. It seems to work the same as on a desktop. No problems or issues so far.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|this movie is just amazing hands down no argument! The is so much character development with the main characters its awesome. I wish this had become a really popular series
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I couldn't wait to get back to reading this book.  When I wasn't reading I kept wondering what was gonna happen next.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Say what you will but Madonna never stops creating quality music. The album is a bit more sophisi<br />ticated and shows a deeper level of musical talant, along with the quality and dance beats that she does so well. I love the 2nd CD that comes with the bonus pack as it has the remix of LUV Madonna which is really fun. some of the best songs on the album are Addicted, and the song Bang Bang shot my lover in the head is by far the most fun song on the album. You gain more appriciation to the album the more you listen to it, it is more than just a cool beat, there is thought and soul put into the lyrics that you just do not find in most albums on the charts recently. I would encourage any one who likes to dance, and can appriciate quality music to buy and enjoy this album.
B00004VXF2|4.0|Think \\"experimental\\" as The Beatles Revolution No. 9, \\"chaotic\\" as Pink Floyd's A Saucerful of Secrets, \\"atmospheric \\" as Nine Inch Nails' \\"Ghost I-IV\\" and I'm still not quite on target to what Metal Machine Music is like. But I hope that helps.
0374275637|5.0|Great book and gives a lot of depth on prospect theory and descision making.  Great examples, great stories, great research.  They tie prospect theory in with other recent reaseach like expert intuition research, Vernon Smith's market research, etc.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The idea is unique -- a generation silo not all that different from a generation starship. A wonderful heroine who grows in front of our eyes. Secondary characters that complement her very nicely. I read this straight through in two days, and that's a lot of pages.<br /><br />Shortly after this, I read a hardback by a fairly big name author.<br /><br />This was better. It's one of the best science fiction books I've read this year, and I read a mess of science fiction.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|if you like games that you get prehistoric pets and have babies (2only) then you will love this game. I highly. recommend. this game for all ages
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this because it's marketed for adolescents.  Having passed that point in my life some time ago, I still found it interesting and entertaining.
B007JZGIMS|4.0|This is a must have app for iTunes users (or iPod/iPhone converts) who also use iSyncr. It integrates seamlessly with iTunes/iSyncr for star ratings, play counts, playlists, scrobbling, etc. The developer updates the app often and is very approachable and promptly responds to inquiries.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Best game ever!!! Must play!! i luv it!! its not a waste of time ggggggeeeetttttt it geeettttt ittt getttt iittg get it get it must must must
B006XIR9KM|5.0|This game adds a great twist to memory and is very smooth. I especially like the slide to pause and fluidity overall.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the all is very fin and addicting. For those who are sating they cant get out of the game without shutting the app off, all you need to do is press &quot;stuff&quot; and then &quot;options&quot;. I recommend you get this because you will never get bored.<br /><br />I've only rated four stars because sometimes the game takes too long of a wait and while you are waiting there is nothing else to do. that is all.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|I just downloaded this on my fire and was kind of skeptically because of the low reviews. I must say I am impressed with this game. graphics are nice and I love the twist on the old memory game! well worth telnet download!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good fun for whole family.  Kids will love it.  Adults will have fun too.  Can't wait to see updates.  Thank you.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the title caught my eye. I always loved playing the orgeon trail in elementary school. I thought it was going to beblike the old computer game,  but its more like farmville then anything else. I do like it though. its quite addicting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a fun waste of time with only one issue.  The curve of earning coins with which you unlock games gets unnecessarily steep rather quickly, making it obvious that the game is all wrapped up in its own &quot;special offers&quot; scheme.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i remember playing the oregon trail in elementary school. i loved it then and more now. yeah energy goes quick but worth waiting for.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|This was my first Blue Ray and 3-D movie I purchased.  I shut off the audio after about 5 minutes due to the political content.  Sorry I bought it.  I think a lot more folks provide a better review.  I just wanted to let Amazon know that I felt deceived as I love the Grand Canyon, but I do not like to be lectured.
1439181780|5.0|You can feel the joy and love caressing the pages of this book from Rhonda and many people quoted!  Beautiful colors and images adorn the pages!  Historical spiritual leaders, scientists, authors and many others quotes grace the pages.  The book is about harnessing the powerful force of love(Law of Attraction) in your daily life to improve your health, relationships, and finances.  I have read this book several times and I also recommend \\"The Power\\" book on CD's which is joyously narrated by Rhonda's beautiful voice!<br /><br />Your thoughts are things(vibrations) and are manifesting into physical form through the energy you are giving to your beliefs(chronic thoughts).  Your feelings are a feedback indicator from the universal Energy Source as to whether your emotions are positive or negative.  This is explained in more detail in \\"The Astonishing Power of Emotions- Let Your Feelings be Your Guide\\" by Esther Hicks, whose works was used as a foundation by Rhonda for making \\"The Secret\\".<br /><br />As much as I loved \\"The Secret\\", \\"The Power\\" was even better! FYI- \\"The Secret\\" is rated 3.6 vs 4.4 for \\"The Power\\" on Amazon.  Rhonda says all she learned since \\"The Secret\\" was published is in here.  She says it is not necessary to read \\"The Secret\\" first.  I think you can appreciate \\"The Power\\" more if you read \\"The Secret\\" first or have some familiarity  with the Law of Attraction before you read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Having access to all translations is so helpful! The absolute best feature is the Live connection.  Being able to use this app in church to follow sermon notes and then be able to email them is GREAT!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Its hard to get teenage boys to read much these days.  My son got a kindle for Christmas and we have bought several books but this was by far his favorite.
B0071WQ7WU|3.0|Shinedown goes for the commercial rock sound on their fourth CD, \\"Amaryllis,\\" which means if you like Nickelback, you'll probably dig this. Plenty of stop/start guitar chords and lead singer Bent Smith does good vocal air-horn, and drummer Barry Kerch is a secret weapon. Shinedown go hard fast and melodic. Nothing new, here.<br /><br />What does set them apart is subject. \\"Bully\\" takes on a touchy subject; if you're in high school and you actually look like most hard rockers do, you're probably gonna get the crap kicked out of you. Shinedown goes for the topic with gusto and it is the best thing on the disc. Second is their smack-back of fair-weather fans on \\"Nowhere Kids,\\" who will probably dislike this album since it went top ten.<br /><br />There is the obligatory set of power ballads on \\"Amaryllis,\\" \\"I'll Follow You\\" actually has some soul to it (and strings). Smith can carry a melody just fine, and he does so on the acoustic finale, \\"Living Through The Ghost.\\" Shinedown uses \\"Amaryllis\\" to come off as better than the average rock band, and this may be their best album so far.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|WOW! First of all Bared to You has got to be one of the HOTTEST erotic romance novels I have ever read.... I mean HOT HOT HOT!!!! I read a lot of reviews that compared this book to Fifty and while I see the similarities I have to admit it had a completely different feel! Eva... wow what a strong woman, to have been through everything she went through and still turn out to be Strong, Sweet, and have a back bone in a relationship where most women would cower at the intensity totally pleased me. Usually I get so irritated with heroines and their insecurities but with Eva I didn't feel that at all...I really liked her!! Gideon, YUM! He had his own issues with his past, we never quite learned exactly what those issues were but obviously they are deep and haunt him to his core but something about Eva brings out the good in him. I'm anxious for the next book in the Crossfire Series!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play. After a busy day it's nice to play a simple game of solitaire. This version fits the bill perfectly.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|A superbly insightful broad brush review of history that brings out the salient conditions politics must meet before a sustainable market based economy can be stablished.  Must read for development bankers who must grapple with such political issues in emerging markets.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|Overall the game is pretty good in the end. But it is more like mindless playing, not like a game you play for &quot;entertainment&quot;. But nice music, cool colors, what more could you want? (:
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|The Movie is fantastic!! Loved it. The ULTRA VIOLET \\"Digital COPY\\" is NOT, NOT, NOT a digital copy. This is one of the biggest shams in quite some time. Maybe Windows user's will have better luck, but Apple folks, like myself, well this just ruins all the convenience of iTunes...which i believe is the point. You are not paying for a digital copy that you can easily transfer thru iTunes. No, the digital copy has its own program to view it on...and it has its own issues. Save YOUR MONEY!! Don't BUY \\"Ultra Violet\\" Combo Packs!! Send a message to the distributors, this CHANGE is NO GOOD!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well written, filled with twists and turns. Character development is consistent with Book 1, The Hunger Games. Am enjoying reading this book,well worth the time, and will continue with Book 3 as well!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|It will not let you quit the game. You have to power down the Kindle and then reboot.<br /><br />That is enough to get it 1 star, but I'll try to rate the game play as well.<br /><br />For the game play I give it -1 million stars.<br /><br />The game forces you along with a glowing arrow.  You cannot make your own choices so you're not even really playing a game.<br /><br />I imagine they stop doing that at some point, but I'm not waiting around to find out.  It is sooooooooo boring.
B007SGM084|4.0|These are not my type of books but all the publicity made me curious. I think the first person narrative is what hooked me and Mr. Grey, he is an intriguing character. The sex scenes seem to be getting all the press but there is much more to these books than sex. As a man I wonder how many other guys are reading the Grey trilogy.[[ASIN:059514568X The Souls of Dumah]]
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|******* ATTENTION: THIS IS NOT A PROFFESIONAL REVIEW. I'M A REGULAR READER, OTHERWISE JUST ANOTHER WOMAN FROM AROUND THE CORNER**********************<br /><br />I downloaded a sample on my Kindle, and couldn't stop reading. So I bought the Trilogy, and I couldn't stop reading, until... it just got boring. I found myself skipping pages at the end, getting lost in eternal descriptions of mental states.<br /><br />The characters are too irreal, Katniss has too much testosterona for being a woman.<br /><br />PROS: great hook in the start, and you don't know who will she choose, until the end (if ever)<br />CONS: repetitive descriptions of madness and thoughts, and the lenght is too much. Only very good books are allowed to be so long.<br /><br />To finish, I would like to apologize about my English (it is not my first language), and thank you for your time.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|Nice little surprise FAOTD game.  A polished twist of the old memory game.  There are no permission concerns either.  Recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the game-until my battery died and reset all my timers to two days and made my family die of cholera.  This happened every time I let it run down whether or not I was playing at the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally recommend this book, it was great for me to read, I finished it in 3 days! It has a little bit of everything; suspense, romance, action, drama, etc.  It's easy to read and also has a very interesting theme,it made me think about our world today, and in the future.
B005LAIIS0|2.0|Could hardly make it to the end of this movie.  The acting was actually pretty good and the special effects for the plane crash were excellent (thus the 2 stars).  Everything else was horrible.  The wolves were 'inserted' at the appropriate times to enhance the drama/suspense; however, when they became a distraction for the action - poof - they were gone.  The howling was done the same way... dialogue, dialogue, tension between actors (ok, cue the wolves) HOWLING (ok, stop so we can get some more dialog).  This was so corny.  Also, during the scene in the snow when they leave the airplane wreck the wind is blowing so hard you can't hear anything else, yet when they stop to help somebody they speak with library voices, and it's just fine, the wind is gone.  Oh and did I mention I should have walked out when he curses God near the end.  Don't waste your time with this.  Buy Unknown or Taken instead.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I've read a lot of Sophie Kinsella books and I loved each one of them, including this one.  This book made me smile a lot.  It is funny, easy to read, and it also kept me wanting to continue reading the story.  I'm a romantic, and I just love this kind of books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its good but I wish there was faster way to get games. anyone know the answer? and I'm not getting other games so it would be faster.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A brilliant movie. It's hard to explain why, but in large part it's because it does so much, so well. This is the rarest of the rare, a true comedy of manners, impeccably done, poking fun at two different cultures. It is sweet, incisive, sardonic, illuminating, morose, funny and sad. Bill Murray is a genius. There is no other actor I can think of who could have pulled off his role. Marlon Brando maybe. The character of Bob Harris is achingly real. When Murray was younger I always wondered if he would ever be able to completely immerse himself in a character without showing flashes of his Bill Murray persona. The answer is yes, he can. It is amazing just to watch him act in this movie. But everyone is good. Who knew that Anna Faris could act? Scarlett Johansson is excellent. Giovanni Ribisi is always strong, but in this movie, like Murray, he disappears into his role. Great work.<br /><br />For those of you who don't get this movie, I understand why you don't get it, but this is an absolutely brilliant movie. One of the best movies ever made. If you think this movie is boring, you do not yet understand what life is about. Hint, it's really not about car chases. If you ever obtain the life experience to understand it, you may grow to love this movie. Watch it again in 20 years. Or visit Japan and then watch it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is fricking awesome! It's taken all other touch screen zombie killing games, lined em up and kicked them in the @*&amp;! A must have for the Kindle Fire
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You guys can talk all you want about how you read it but there were only 24 revies before the movie came out so shut your flippen faces but i have to agrre it is a god book no question about that
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is keeping me entertained. Sure you run out of &quot;energy&quot; after a while, but it recharges 1 thing of energy every 3 minutes, so I just put my kindle away for a while and do other things with my time. I like it that way, I'd hate to sit and waste my day on it like so many people do with Farmville. I just wish I could move some of the townspeople so my buildings can be placed better.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|its slow loading for my lg55c but otherwise will play without ANY lag. also plays nice on kindle fire.fast load,no hiccups,no freezes,and no lag. also wondering for thoese nexus users,have android to blame for this one.they chose to remove some of the software support. thank them.
0345803485|4.0|For starting out as fan-fiction and revising a little to publish, I thought it was pretty good! I love her style of writing, I noted some people here didn't. For being a first time author, it was pretty darn good! I've recommended it several times and everyone else seems to love it as much as I did. It's been on the best seller's list for a reason, worth the read.<br /><br />I've never been into smut nor would I have ever thought about reading a book about BDSM, but I stand corrected. As the story goes on it becomes clear that it's much deeper than that. I love that fact that she lays out the love scenes without being vulgar. It definitely kept me wanting and needing to know more. I only hope she releases the trilogy from Christian's prospective. :)
B007MNV5WU|2.0|they take. forever to make updates so I wouldn't buy it and they made extra stuff on the app store not for androied so don't buy it
B006MHWXMS|5.0|this app made my life much easier! so glad I got it and it majorly helps during grocery shopping. I recommend anyone who has a kindle get this app!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Its super fun.  i had so much fun playing. the graphics are great and its very addictive. I ts kinda like the oringinal one but way better.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I'm enjoying this game.  It's entertaining and well made despite the glitches.  For those of you having a hard time getting out of the game, one way I found is to hit the \\"more games\\" icon on the upper right corner and select one of the games.  This takes you back to the Apps screen (you don't actually have to install another game).  From there, you can navigate back to home or wherever else you'd like.  Not exactly intuitive but it does work.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Loved it!  A few editing errors, but nothing that can take away from the beauty of the book.  I had a real hard time setting it down.  A definite read...ENJOY!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|entertaining.... love ice age. had trouble exiting but got that worked out... cute build with cute  characters. need more content.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Awesome Movie, especially if you love dogs!  It just proves how loyal man's best friend really is...or potentially could be!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this has a great variety of games.  I look forward to continue to unlocking new games.  I highly recommend this game.
B002RVZV9K|3.0|If they replaced The Edge with Keith Richards, it would be a 5 Star. The Edge actually shows us in the film what a limited guitarist he is, couple that with his Dull Personality, and it pulls the film down. Keith would have been a much better choice.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|If you enjoy mah jong, then this is the game for you.  Easy to use with a simple instruction guide.  I liked the story mode as well as the classic mode; and the endless mode can be addictive.  Hours of fun.
B0055SWM08|5.0|extremely cool relaxing game very challenging mentally stimulating fun puzzles great music and gameplay will be playing this game for a long time
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am keeping a daily log....due to a back injury, so far its been the best thing I have found to keep this log without having to write it down manually in a note book, I know there has to be more uses and abilities that this app can do but I haven't been able to find any instructions, manuals, or videos of its true application or abilities.  I know or feel that there is more that it can do but have no idea how to use it to its full capacity and I truly would like to know. I hope that the designers of this application will come out with a video possibly on Youtube or a manual that will show all of its uses and let those of us using this app know where to get a copy of the manual or were to go watch its video.  So we can all be proficient users of Evermore.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie Kinsella again writes a funny grab-you book. I always laugh when I follow her characters through all of their tales. It always starts with a little<br />accident and a little white lie and takes off from there. Great fun again.
B007A6XLDU|5.0|Great app. I was first shocked at the easy interface which gave me all the editing abilities that the other apps offered. You will be pleased.
068485743X|3.0|Its a very basic book on writing and I did enjoy it but its not for the seasoned writer. Most of this is picked up in English 101 and writing conferences/workshops. It would be a good pick for a creative writing class (undergrad). One major factor missing (probably on purpose) is the rise of ePublishing. Some fantastic writers are finally getting their chance and not having to rely on temperamental editors, agents or even sales reps. John Kennedy Toole would probably still be alive if A Confederacy of Dunces had been ePublished.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Fantastic book couldn't put it down read the whole three of them within 4 days , would highly recommend them
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Obviously bought this for my teenagers!  But i also love the movies!! hard to find good movies these days but this is a good series
B000R9RGF6|5.0|amazing instruments - great way to relax and enjoy music. I think anyone with any taste will like this! Highly recommended
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Quite fun. I recommend it. New twist on the classic OT. Sort if like farmville but MUCH better. I've been playing it for a few days.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|I love James Morrison so much, He makes incredible music!! I have all his cds, and they are all amazing! This cd just keeps getting better, I can't stop listening to it!!!!!
B000V39KDO|3.0|Nobody seems to care that the movie is highly racist and historically inappropriate. It seems to me that if you can make a visually stunning entertainer with great dialogues and muscular men you can sell any amount of racial prejudices, homophobia, historical revisionism and war propaganda. I would have liked the movie if the context was fictional and not based of a real historical battle. Movies like this can do great harm when viewed and cherished by the great multitudes of parochially educated, culturally and historically ignorant people that populate most of our world. This movie reminds me of Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom and its effect on the teeming ignoramuses of the world in forming opinions about Indians. Of course, everyone knows this is a fantasy movie. But how many people watching this movie are literate enough to have actually read anything about the glory of ancient Persian, Indian or Native American cultures to form a more informed opinion about these cultures? If all they are exposed to is Apocalypto, 300 and Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom which is usually the case then racial prejudices and unfounded notions of superiority over these civilizations are inevitable.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book was wonderful! Full of descriptive detail and intrigue! I must admit these stories take some getting used to. Understanding the author wants each character to tell you their points of view, interests, and dilemmas personally while still allowing the story lines to flourish.  This is definitely a way to thoroughly engross the reader. How much can the reader take once invested in the story? Read this and find out.  Could not put this down! When I did, I had to pick it up again.
B004EPYSN2|5.0|really enjoyed this book yet another great story from a great auther can highly recomend it as a book that will take your imagination to amazing places
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I dont normally read this genre of books. That being said, I really enjoyed this book.  I was thoroughly sucked in by the playful banter between the main characters.  I almost passed on this book when it was given to me to read.  I am glad I didnt pass.  Just goes to show... dont judge a book by genre(cover).  The inside just might pleasantly suprise you.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter and I are enjoying this.  It moves faster than most games of this type and while you can spend extra dollars on acorns and coin, you do not have to,  They can be earned.
B0045HCJ94|4.0|I've only seen scenes from this movie and thought the acting was incredible and it's ranked on everyone's list in the top 100 of all time. I notice it's rated R--but is that an R by the standards of 40 years ago or now? Would this be appropriate to show to a high school class in a conservative area?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Once I started reading I was not able to put down this book.  I read all three books in this Trilogy.  The books are much better than the movie, with much more life and depth to the characters where you are able to feel and understand what motivates each one.  I found the book very original in its story with everything from drama, life issues, sadness, love and loads of unanticipated action.  A definite must read.....
B007SYWFRM|1.0|so I downloaded this game into my kindle fire. thought it would be a fun game. HA! Not only is it like every other game but it was very slow and it lagged. it even froze my kindle and forced it to restart. boooooo to this game booooo.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I had first bought a small case that the kindle slid in and out of. It did not have the ability to convert to a stand and did not hold the kindle snug....THIS PRODUCT IS TOTALLT THE OPPOSITE!<br />I love this thing. It is durable, convenient and just all around awesome.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love the game on the computer it is no different in the kindle. I love the closeness of the hint button it makes it that much easier to keep your head in the game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I whish there was a way to get acorns with out paying real money. I do like the farm style tho.its really cool!
B002ZG976U|4.0|The case was a little rough but it was used. The disc plays and I got it in the time frame I was supposed to. I am happy with my movie.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|IT IS FUN BUT ANNOYING it's fun because you can do things that you do in real life.It's annoying because you have to wait for energy
B001FA0NZ6|4.0|This is such a great book, with the exception of the miniature photos!  You can't enlarge the photos for detail.  If you want a good Kindle/iPad makeup book, buy Makeup Makeovers Beauty Bible by Robert Jones.  The content is just as good and the photos can be enlarged for detail.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Ah, my friends, A is bAck and better then ever. Season 2 is just as good as season 1.  A is back and causing trouble for our pretty little liars, and A isn't plAying any games. A targets each of the pretty little liars, and has a special plan for them. The closer Aria, Spencer, Emily and Hanna gets to A, the more A turns up the heat. However, A isn't all the PLL's have to worry about.  Hanna has family issues she has to deal with, Aria has some extra credit smooches with someone (and if you've seen season 1, you know who it is) and A tries to expose it., Emily has to deal with a person she loves, and Spencer learns some dark secrets from her family's past. People aren't who they seem to be or aren't really who they say the are.  The PLL's are determined to corner A and have A reveAled, the problem is that A is waiting from them.<br /><br />The PLL's also dig deep into Allison's disappearance in hopes to find out what happened to her. The problem is they get too close and A is pulling certain strings and sets out breadcrumbs for our PLL's to follow, and they follow like good little ducks, and falling into A's trap.<br /><br />This season is a lot darker than the first one, and that's what I love about it. My favorite episode is the second to last. Honestly, it gave me the creeps, and that's not easy to do. Wait to you hear the line, \\"Follow me and end  up like me.\\"<br /><br />This show has a lot of plot twits and turns that you can't help get addicted too.  It's just so much fun seeing A do certain things, and we can sit back and enjoy what happens.<br /><br />If you've read the books, or have seen season 1, then you know what to expect, and you won't be disAppointed.  I know I wasn't.  You can purchase this on June 5th, the same day as Season 3 starts, and when the next book in the series, Stunning, comes out.<br /><br />This is A's world, and we just live in it.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Nothing like the previous \\"ape planet\\" films, this one may actually be plausable. Unlike the others, the apes do not rein over the humans and the story is handled well by good actors, such as John Lithgow.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading the trilogy of the Hunger Games I thought I would never again read anything of that caliber and I haven't, up until Wool!  I borrowed it based on all the positive reviews and with much skepticism waiting for yet another disappointment since Hunger Games.  Well what a pleasant surprise and wow was I ever wrong.  The book was well written and a real page turner with lots of surprises you don't see coming.  There are a lot of bad reads out there but that doesn't apply here.  I will anxiously await Wool #6 and beyond and will also be looking forward to a movie (I hope).
B004EPYZSK|4.0|No surprises from Daniel Craig or Harrison Ford, who always seem to do a great job. The cheesey title masks what is actually a not bad movie with plenty of entertainment value.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game highly addictive and great. for mindless droning.  I like ti play it when it when I waiting at the doctor's office.  makes me forget how long u have been sitting. there
B001684L0A|5.0|I am French, lived in the Boston area for 7 years, quite a while ago... I knew a little bit about the \\"debuts\\" of the United States, and have watched this series with great pleasure and interest. I like everything, the acting, photography, setting, costumes... and, most of all, I find it INSPIRING!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I couldn't put it down! It captures you from the very beggining. You're pulled right into the action as soon as you start reading, and see the main characters first impressions of each other. There's never any down time; you're constantly engaged, wanting to know what's going to happen.  I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle the ups and downs of finding Mr. Right.<br />On a side note, I'd love to see this book turned into a movie. I think it has a great story line.
B002DKF47O|5.0|This is a very good blackend deth metal album.  Lacks more \\"corny\\" black metal attributes that most people find a bit ridiculous.  The lyrics are great. much more profound than most others I have known(granted you most likely need to look them up, but that just makes it easier to hear them).  great stuff, great videos for the tracks as well. I think every black metal and deathmetal fan need to listen to this band and album.
030788743X|1.0|I'm a long-time gamer and 90s child who grew up with considerable exposure to the remnants of the 80s: the era's music on early VH1/MTV, endless re-runs, \\"tonight's feature movie\\" on local channels, and any 8-bit games I could get my hands on. Upon learning of this book's existence, I was immediately drawn to it.<br /><br />Then I started reading and an underwhelming feeling quickly set in. The premise of the book, a deadly treasure hunt in a virtual game world, is so appealing but Cline's execution is poor by any standard of good science fiction. I more recently finished reading Starship Troopers and The Forever War; both completely sold me on their fantastic futuristic settings through superb writing, complex characters and intricate details. Ready Player One, however, felt very clumsy in its descriptive narrative of the OASIS. It was like listening to a kid telling me of the super-cool dreams he recently experienced. Okay, so there are hundreds of perfectly rendered worlds in every direction. Nice, I guess. You can travel to any place, real or imagined, from any television show, any movie, and every computer/board game in existence? Alright. You have Cool Item from Old Movie that does Amazing Action just when needed. Neat. Just flat, extravagant exclamations that are simultaneously dull and hard to believe.<br /><br />The next great disappointment was in the adventure itself. Parzival's obstacles are little more than long-winded explanations of a movie's script or the gameplay mechanics of an old coin-op. This is repeated a few times and makes up the bulk of Halliday's \\"incredible\\" hunt. It's about as riveting as a technical manual, perhaps a little more so, if only because the source material happens to be pop culture and games. Speaking of which, the 80s reference material throughout the adventure is treated as such: reference material. A majority of the story is simply footnotes sprinkled all over the place in the least compelling fashion possible.<br /><br />Along the adventure are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts that are meant to be people: Awful Parent Figure, Sweet Elderly Neighbor, Grrl Gamer Love Interest, Trusty Cool Friend, Noble Asian Warriors, and Really Evil Bad Guy. Boring and lifeless. At times, I over-estimated Cline and expected some interesting twist out of one of these dull characters. Aech or Art3mis as a double agent? The latter is terribly deformed? Evil villain's complex history showing he's much more than meets the eye (e.g. Jaime Lannister in ASoIaF)? An amazing hitherto unknown mystery about OASIS or its creator? Never happens. In fact, nothing remotely surprising happens throughout besides a clumsy bit of nothing when Parzival meets a friend in person. To be quite honest, it didn't seem like there were any characters in the story other than the author and his shoddy self projections of what Girl, Friend or Enemy are supposed to be. The character interactions were so forced, stunted and unbelievable, that the imagination couldn't possibly conjure that these were distinct people talking to one another. It was more like a single socially awkward person having a far-fetched conversation with himself.<br /><br />My last major issue was the climax. Without spoiling anything, there were multiple ludicrous and convenient deus-ex machina, so jarring that you're ripped out of the little immersion the book was able to manage. The final confrontation played out like a nerdy fantasy dream scenario straight out of some sloppy fanfic. It's epically epic, stuff blows up, heroes get to flex muscles and kick ass in grand fashion, the villain behaves like a villain and does villain stuff, all culminating in the \\"You Win!\\" ending we saw coming 300 pages ago. It plays out like the shallowest next-gen action/shooter you can think of. There are ultimately no consequences, no moral quandaries to ponder, as is the hallmark of good sci-fi. What will happen now in the OASIS or the bleak real world? Who cares, says the author. What Cline/Parzival wanted on page one, he plainly and predictably got on the last page. The end, goodbye.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is a movie, not like any other war film. This is a story, of Real Special Forces Guys, Serving their Country,  played by real Special Forces Guys Dont miss it.........
B006XIR9KM|1.0|this match game promotes racism. Match two that are identical ? for real? I finally got my kid to stop asking why different races look different and here comes Amazon telling him he can only win if he sticks together with his own kind! not cool, now my son will never date Shaneekwa Smith or Nguyen Chan, he will always be scarred. Oh well, he's only 5 so I guess he will have to stick with Hockey Fight Pro!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i love this game. It is super addicting and probably good that they basically restrict playing time by making you wait for more energy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not a hard-core 'Firefly' fan.  I've caught re-runs on tv when I can find them, and I can honestly say that this is from my amateur opinion a GOOD show.<br /><br />I personally see a lot of references to the anime 'Trigun', the premise seems very similar.  The artistic choice of combining space exploration and the old west is a neat concept by it's creators.<br /><br />Sci-Fi element wise this is a little on the light side.  There are no laser pistals, or anything of that nature.  Like Trigun, the weapons of choice still seem to be bullets.  Also I don't recall ever seeing any aliens.  I could be wrong about this though...<br /><br />I then saw 'Serenity' when it was released.  This confirmed for me that this franchise really was good and also sadly did not get the justice it was due.  I was not blown away by the movie, but at the same time could see the merit in it.  Now years later I would like to completely submerge myself in it and really give it my undivided attention.  The fact that fan-boys are still adament about this series further drives the point home that the networks and studios made a grave mistake canceling it.  Unfortunately that's life.  We live in a society where people care more about what some degenerates are doing down by the Jersey Shore.  Thought provoking, plausible Sci-Fi shows and movies with great actors are just not in demand anymore, for the most part...<br /><br />It's a shame really.  Nathan Fillion, (who SHOULD have been the Green Lantern), is a charming but tuff when necessary captain.  Adam Baldwin is a bad ass who also seemed a bit clumsey to me at times.  In my opinion the whole cast was good.<br /><br />As I said I've never seen the entire series, but now that it's so cheap, I will buy this series and 'Serenity' and watch it back to back.  Then I can call myself a true Fan-Boy of 'Firefly.'  For me the DVD release will be just fine.  I've seen no major posts about any defects or anything of that nature, so I'm fairly confident this will be a good purchase.<br /><br />For those of you who are still sad this went off the air, I feel your pain.  I loved 'Spider-Man the 1994 series.'  It was canceled and NEVER released completely on DVD in America.  'Mantis' was good as well, along with the 2002 'He-Man'.  And let us not forget how great Toonami and Adult Swim used to be.  One of my biggest regrets is that I didn't watch Anime back then when it was so easily available.  OH REGRETS...<br /><br />Good shows leave television, and all we can do is move on and try to find NEW entertaining things to watch.  Good luck in your search, most nights I strike out...nt this will be a good purchase.<br /><br />For those of you who are still sad this went off the air, I feel your pain.

B000059GEH|4.0|I have not seen very many Marilyn Monroe movies, and thought I should check this one out. First of all, aside from Marilyn, you've also got Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable to share the screen with her. What a treat! All three woman were just fantastic. Marilyn was quite funny playing a \\"blind-as-a-bat\\" girl without her glasses. As the title suggests, the film is about three woman who rent an apartment together with a scheme to marry a millionaire. What happens to each girl during their plan is both hillarious and sweet. The ending was as cute as you could expect.<br /><br />The only thing that prevented me from giving this movie 5 stars, is the long winded introduction. The film opens with a full orchestra on stage performing a number for the first 6 minutes of the movie. When the song finally ends, the conductor turns around for a quick bow, then starts another song! At that point I actually said out loud, \\"you've gotta be kidding me!\\" Luckily, the opening credits begin at that point, and the actual movie saved the day!

B003F5NSTW|5.0|This is a very interesting book, which at times makes you sick to your stomach. I found myself frequently thinking about parenting skills, how I have dealt with my own children, importance of communication between the parents and understanding each other. I wondered throughout the book if it would have been possible to prevent this calamitous sequence of events, with earlier intervention and better communication and understanding between Eva and Franklin. I have also spent some time thinking about forgiveness, what it means and what degree of forgiveness I would be capable of myself.<br />This book definitely stays with you after you have finished reading it.
B0061S0A64|4.0|Fun to play with... great to just listen to your creations... only thing I wish was different was if I could turn off the screen and still have it playing music... don't want to let my screen get too hot or die... I've had a screen die before... other than that its awesome. So many customizations, it never gets old

B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite For Destruction is the first album released by the greatest rock band in history.  I love every album from Appetite to Chinese Democracy.  The 12 reasons to buy this album is as follows:<br /><br />1. WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE - An amazing song and a legend to this day.  It's rage infueled vocals are unmatched by any other.  About the seedy parts of LA.<br />2. IT'S SO EASY - This is a perfect way to start out a concert. An amazing bass intro and boom, rough and fast music.<br />3. NIGHTRAIN - More attitude from the band. A great song from start to finish.<br />4. OUT TA GET ME - This song shows the paranoia that lead singer Axl Rose has dealt with his entire career.<br />5. MR. BROWNSTONE - This song is actually about themselves \\"Show usually starts around 7, we don't get there till around 9\\" just what they did in real concerts.<br />6. PARADISE CITY - The ultimate rock song. One of their most famous ones that only Guns could pull off.<br />7. MY MICHELLE - As like most of GNR's songs, there is a true story behind this one. You guessed it, it's about a girl named Michelle.<br />8. THINK ABOUT YOU - Showed that GNR had a soft side to them. A really underated song.<br />9. SWEET CHILD O' MINE - Probably their most famous song. The intro and vocals are iconic.<br />10. YOU'RE CRAZY - Your regular GNR attitude filled song. Not their best, but still a good song.<br />11. ANYTHING GOES - This song is what GNR was all about.<br />12. ROCKET QUEEN - The perfect way to end this album. It starts off as a screaming rock song, and seamlessly shifts to something more delicate and heartfelt.<br /><br />Alright, there's your 12 reasons, go out and buy this CD now!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is an incredibly fun game! I have the Samsung Galaxy S2 and have never had ANY problems.

B0059XTUXQ|5.0|In recent years, the English movie industry has been producing little movies about important persons or significant moments in the history of the empire, and two of them were recently nominated for Academy Awards, due to memorable performances by the main actresses in their respective films: Michelle Williams for \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" and Meryl Streep for \\"The Iron Lady.\\"  But, cinematically speaking, it was the majestic \\"The Iron Lady\\" which received better praise due to the complexity and significance of the story, as it magnificently captures the rise and fall of England's first female Prime Minister.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, who won the Best Actress Academy Award, plays Margaret Thatcher, and we first meet her in her later years, when she is showing the first signs of senility. She is aging and is constantly disturbed by the imaginary presence of her late husband Denis (Jim Broadbent). She spends the time - screen time, that is - remembering her younger years during World War II, when she used to work at her father's grocery store; how her father taught her how to be strong; and her years attending Oxford University. She is shown as a young woman with strong convictions, trying to accomplish something meaningful in life, saying at one time, \\"I can not die washing up a tea cup!\\" Margaret Roberts marries Denis Thatcher and soon they become parents. She goes into politics and becomes a Member of Parliament, eventually reaching the post of Prime Minister, being the first woman in holding that position. From then on, of course, we witness Thatcher dealing with a myriad of issues, including economic crises, clashes with the IRA, the Falklands war, and the end of the cold war. In every case, her motto was \\"We will stand on principle, or we will not stand at all.\\"  This stance caused her some enemies inside and outside England.<br /><br />\\"The Iron-Lady\\" is a well-documented and to-the-point film, and Meryl Streep shines in the main role, taking into consideration thatshe had to speak the Queen's English. I have to say, however, that there is something about Margaret Thatcher that I never liked. I am not sure what it is, but I believe that it may be the fact that, \\"standing on principle,\\" and perhaps to show character and determination, she chose to go to war for possession of an island far away from England, and with no apparent strategic significance, just to make a point. As I write this, there is another movement in Argentina claiming that the Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands) belong to them. At times, too, watching Streep with all the impressive make-up, as well as some of her facial movements, reminded me of Faye Dunaway in \\"Mommie Dearest.\\" The delightful Blue-ray + DVD + Digital copy edition also includes a making-of documentary, as well as some features about the costumes, Denis Thatcher, English politics, and more. (UK/France, 2011, color. 105 min plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on April 19, 2012 by Eric Gonzales for The Weinstein Company / Anchor Bay Entertainment.

B004EPZ03Y|5.0|The Muppets are part of US history as much as anything else that you hold true and dear to this mighty country. They are one thing that should make us proud as humans, a tradition that shall never die, a source of happiness that shall never end. Maybe for that reason several movies and TV shows about the Muppets have been done since the first film in 1979, which was released before season four of \\"The Muppet Show.\\" This new 2011 version, simply called \\"The Muppets,\\" lives up to its expectations and carries the spirit of its predecessors. It is one truly fun and delightful film for all the family.<br /><br /> \\"The Muppet\\" is described as a \\"live-action musical feature film,\\" which means that, in addition to the story, there are some musical elements to it. On this occasion, the story begins in a town simply referred to as SmallTown, USA. It is there that we find brothers Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (the Muppet). We see them when they are small, and as they grow and mature. The problem is, Gary grows up, but Walter stays small. Despite their differences, they love each other and live a happy life. Both of them, too, enjoyed watching \\"The Muppet Show\\" on TV. But for Walter it was much more than a TV show -- it was a revelation. He indentified with the Muppets - he was one of them --, and Kermit the Frog became his hero.<br /><br />One day, Gary tells Walter the he and Mary (Amy Adams), his girlfriend, were going to Hollywood and that he was invited to go with them. Walter was told that one of the stops while visiting town was the famous Muppets Studio. As you can imagine, Walter was very happy and couldn't wait to get there. Once they visit the studios, they become disillusioned because the place was almost in ruins and forgotten. Walter silently gets away from the studio tour, and sneaks inside one of the buildings. He hears voices and hides. One of the voices that hears is that of Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), a powerful businessman that wants to buy the studios, sothat he can demolish them and pump the oil reserve that lies beneath. This, of course, upsets Walter, who notifies Gary and Mary about Richman's cruel intentions. The three of them go to Kermit's mansion, to convince him to try to stop Richman. Kermit is now retired from show business. However, Walter manages to convince him to get the gang together. Enter all of our friends - Fozzie Bear, Animal, Swedish Chef, Gonzo, Scooter, and, of course, Miss Piggy --, and, with the involuntary help of Veronica Martin (Rashida Jones), they will save the day.<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"The Muppets,\\" and, at this point, it seems that I don't get tired of them. Never mind that the film is loaded with guests, such as Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Alan Arkin, Emily Blunt, James Carville, Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, and more. The fantastic Wocka Wocka Value Pack includes the Blu-ray, DVD and Digital copy editions of the movie, as well as the soundtrack. The Blu-ray and DVD also feature making-of specials, deleted scenes, audio commentaries, blooper reels, and much more! Released March 20, 2012.  (USA, 2011, color, 103 min plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on April 19, 2012 by Eric Gonzales for Disney

B006SV2LWA|2.0|This movie is boring, good actors, bad dialog, and slow progression.<br /><br />THe movie is basically showing how fast a virus can become a global epidemic in a matter of hours, i have to admit though, i'm kind of paranoid about being in enclosed spaces now.
B00756GKBA|4.0|Ok, yes it's highly vocodar-ized/synthesized and one or two kinda odd choices (on the deluxe), but I have to admit it's one of my top listens right now (since it came out).  It sort of reminds me of the club album \\"Confessions on the Dance floor\\"...not that it sounds like it, but it's the same kind of fun, bouncy music that I got into when Confessions first came out.  Except for some of the odder tunes (like Birthday Song, which even that is sort of cute), I would highly recommend the album as a whole...Personal faves include: Girls Gone Wild, I'm Addicted, Give Me all your Luvin', I Don't Give A, the groovy-trippy \\"I'm a Sinner\\" (my absolute favorite) and Masterpiece. Gang Bang and Some Girls lots of fun as well.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book a month ago and the reason why I'm just now writing a review is because I wanted to get my thoughts together on this story. Well, I loved it! I read some of the more negative reviews on it and while I can understand their POV, I have to disagree with them. I'm 39 years old, married and have two young children so I may think differently now about how a relationship should be like. If a guy like Travis was in my life now, I might have to say \\"tone it down a little big guy!\\". Remember, I'm older now so my perspective on life and love is different. If I was 18-25 again, I would be all over that! This book had me sighing in a good way! Travis is the type of guy who loves his woman and has no problem showing her how much! He may be a little controlling, hot headed, possessive and loves to go all caveman on her! What guy doesn't to some degree! Come on ladies, we know we love it(sigh!) I would have given this book 4 stars if I wrote this review right after reading it! The reason I give it 5 stars now is because I found myself searching Google, Good Reads and Amazon for more books like it. If I put that much effort into it, I think it deserves 5 stars! I also found a lot of other good books by different authors that I would never had given a thought to reading. Give this book a chance. If your older like me it will make you remember the good old day's of having a roller coaster love ride! Thank you Jamie McGuire. Keep em' coming!!
B0043U944G|5.0|This is a great series.  If you like stories out of ancient Rome, and you don't mind some stylized action scenes, this is an excellent, EXCELLENT series.  I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok its really fun! !!!!<br /> but you have to work really hard but very easy<br />l enjoy it verry much!!
0439023521|5.0|Since The Hunger Games is supposed to be a young adult book, before I bought it I checked with my 16 year old granddaughter.  She assured me that I would like it (we both loved the Harry Potter books) so I bought it from Amazon.  It came in a timely manner and to tell the truth, I could hardly put it down.  Great book for any age in my opinion.  I also saw the movie which is mostly true to the book. I convinced one of my daughters to read it too and she also loved it.  In fact, we saw the movie together!<br /><br />Marjorie Apel
1455508977|4.0|Nicholas Sparks offers up another solid read and probable hit movie in The Lucky One.<br /><br />His readers -- especially the women -- won't be disappointed in this romantic drama. Although it is a little too melodramatic in places for my taste, Sparks is a masterful reader manipulator. Other authors can learn much from his technique in grabbing and holding reader interest. Sparks knows how to tug at a reader's heartstrings.<br /><br />Sparks is not just a successful novelist. He is an industry and his own genre. His mix of angst, tragedy, hurt, healing and romance -- not to mention glistening wet bodies ready for sensuous lovemaking -- is hugely popular, especially with female readers and moviegoers.<br /><br />There is something compelling and haunting in this tale of Logan Thibault (Thigh-bolt), an Iraq veteran who finds a picture of a woman who he considers his lucky charm and goes in search for her back home. There's something a bit creepy about a stalker as a hero, but Sparks pulls it off.<br /><br />Not as good as THE NOTEBOOK, but readers will be satisfied.<br /><br />James A. Anderson, Author<br /><br />DEADLINE<br /><br />THE SCORPION
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was a fun app it was creative and welll just plane fuunnnnnnnnnnnn loved it amazing fun cool nice amazing great are only a few of the words I could use&iexcl;!!!!!!

B005Q1W10A|5.0|We normally don't watch regular television because we do not care for the content--excessive sexuality, profanity, and glamorized violence. I have always enjoyed period piece movies, and I happened to find Season One of Downton Abbey on Netflix. We were instantly drawn into the show. It was refreshing to watch a edge-of-your-seat drama without the inappropriate-ness one finds in regular American television shows.<br />We loved Season One so much, we purchased Season Two, and have just finished watching the season finale! We absolutely love the antics of Cousin Violet--she is perfectly cast, as well as the other characters. We cheered and agonized with the ups and downs of Anna and Mr. Bates. We were in agreement, however, that Lady Rosamund was a perfect match for the awful Sir Richard Carlisle! And don't get us started on the wicked duo--Thomas and O'Brien--they are an evil pair! And we felt it hard to feel sad for Mrs. Bates, though we believe Mr. Bates to be innocent.<br />Our only agony is that we have to wait until September to watch Season 3! Looking forward to the overdue wedding of Matthew and Lady Mary, the reunion of Anna and Mr. Bates, and we are hoping for some justice in regards to the evil plots of Thomas and O'Brien. We also hope so very much that poor Lady Edith will finally have her true love and never be heartbroken again.<br />Bravo and well done!!! We pray this series continues for many, many years to come!!! Five stars is not enough!!!
B006XIR9KM|1.0|I tried one time with the &quot;slow game &quot; and plan to uninstall. The board is not filled when it first comes up (it fills in as you play),  symbols are repeated,  and it appears that some of the symbols shift position as you play.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|Considering the recent apps of the day i didn't have many expectations for this one...but I have to say it's impressive. Not sure if I'd pay for it but great for free. It kept my interest long enough to want to play again. The particle effects are pretty cool too. Great that you can go as fast as possible. Gives it a ticket redemptiom arcadey feel.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|This is an authentic Nikon HB-32 lens hood, not a Chinese replacement version. Works well keeping the sun glare out off. Fits my Nikon 18-135mm lens perfectly. You can check compatibility here: [...]    Fast shipping from Amazon as always!
B006XIR9KM|4.0|this is a fun app and great for the faotd but would not pay for it!!  I like challenging myself to do better and this fits the bill - great for filling time when waiting on something.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|Like the other reviewer before me, superman75 and Brian McGrath aren't funny. They're bad attempts at humor are boarding and sometimes completely disgusting. Especially Brian McGrath. I didn't need to know that he likes seeing naked twins. Ok? That's just wrong.<br /><br />But anyways the game was awesome. It's a retro twist on the matching game. It wasn't too fast or too slow. A well designed faotd.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I love this movie.  I have seen it several times, and it is a great addition to any home library. (That's my criteria - no point in buying a movie if seeing it once is enough&lt;G>)<br /><br />The love story is genuine, the music is great, and the dancing is out of this world!<br /><br />Also captures the times of the 'Borscht Circuit' hotels in the Catskills much as 'Marjorie Morningstar' did.
B004U52VPS|1.0|I purchased this for my six-year old grandson and hand-carried it to Bogota, Colombia.  Nothing about this toy worked.  It was impossible to build any structure shown on any of the cards and the \\"sling shot\\" would not sling the bird more than a couple of inches.  Of course now that I lugged it all the way back to the U. S. , the return window has expired.  I did not receive the MATTEL version -- the MATTEL brand was no where to be found on the box.  A total ripoff.
0446572993|5.0|This is an exciting mystery thriller, that is loaded with suspense, which keeps building from beginning to end. Mr. Baldacci has cleverly constructed a fast paced story with twists and turns, and a double barrel ending that suprised me,  especially the second barrel...and he ties up all the lose ends nicely in the last few pages, so I wasn't left scratching my head.<br /><br />We meet Will Robie on his 40th birthday, a sanctioned assassin for an unknown gov't agency, as he establishes his bona fides for us in the opening chapters. One of his assigments goes wrong, and he winds up being the hunted, while running into a young street wise 'woman' in a fourteen year olds body, who is also being hunted...and the mystery begins, and so does the body count.<br /><br />The book is hard to put down because of the building suspense, and just when you think a clue or hint is about to emerge, the author quickly pulls it away with a reasonable explanation, leaving you wanting more. I'm not a big mystery reader, so I didn't spend time trying to figure out the 'who', and just enjoyed the continous ride toward the 'why'. As such, I'm happy I only scanned the book report reviews, and discovered the story line for myself.<br /><br />I'm sure we will be reading more about \\"Robie\\", as he protects us, the innocent, from those who would harm America...he's good enough to be real! I found nothing objectionable about the book/story. A well deserved 5 star effort by the author, especially after his previous outing \\"Zero Day\\"...nice quick comeback Mr. Baldacci.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Why do they say Kindle Fire Edition? The only way to exit the game is powering off. Wait until they fix interface before downloading.
B005M2A4D4|3.0|When you spend this amount of money on a DVD set, there is no need for the DVD holders to be so flimsy that they break the first time you take a DVD out of the box.<br /><br />Otherwise, Season Six is extremely entertaining even though it goes off into many twists, turns and tangents. I do like Season 5 better.....
B00785P2QC|3.0|So far the game is ok. I can see it is going to be just like any other story game though. Play for 5 minutes then wait because you are either broke or out of energy. I can see it will take forever to be able to build a monument unless you shell out some real cash.
B00000I41J|5.0|I bought this cd mostly because of the musicians that play together on it. Quite an impressive line-up! Awesome music! I listen to it over and over and every time hear something wonderful that I didn't notice before. This is a cd that should be in every jazz lovers collection.
B004J73WZ0|5.0|This set is terrific.  I discovered it as individual disks in Vienna, where I bought the Stokowski 8th and Rosbaud 9.  They were both individually shrink wrapped in the same modest sleaves as fill this box.  I bought the whole set through Amazon specifically for the Klemperer 2nd, Mitropolous 6th and Rosbaud 7th, and I am as blissfully happy with these as I am with 8 and 9.  With some judicious adjustments of bass and treble, the mono sound is quite good generally.  The Reiner 4th is the only stereo recording, but the Mitropolous 6th sounds almost as good as a stereo recording.  These are priceless recordings and should be in every Mahler lover's collection.<br /><br />The caveats: The Walter 5th and Das Lied are substandard remasterings, and you should definitely supplement this box with two additional disks.  These are both phenomenal studio recordings that have received splending remasterings from Sony (2004--Amazon UK)and and Decca Legends (2000), respectively.  It's worth it to buy this complete set and also the Sony 5th (coupled with the Walter 4th!)and the Decca Legends Das Lied. The prices are low because demand is low; those of us who treasure such musical experiences are a dying breed.  Get these while you can.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Im on Samsung galaxy s2 for t-mobile. graphics looks fine, crashes seldomly, and game is great. major concern is that it is SO behind the iphone version. the latest update didnt do much for this problem. on the iphone version, you get a garden, many different modes and mini games. android needs an update. big time.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I just started playing it and it said &quot;You arent connected to internet please connect to internet&quot; i delted it and re downloaded it but it didnt work i suggest that you dont get it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like playing but I don't like that I cant move things once I place them.<br />but I play all the time and really like it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|It's challenging, not frustrating, in a fun but simple way. I really like the short levels and the serene design.
B0000A118M|5.0|After years of being a music lover I have just begun to get seriously into jazz. Heard this collection mentioned on the radio and checked it out. This is incredible music, an absolute \\"must have\\" if you love jazz or want to explore it.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|Love this author! I love these books and stories, that are so well written! Entertaining and keep you on your toes mentally, and on the edge of your seat physically!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I was surprised that this movie was nominated for a 2011 Academy Award for Best Picture.  Was it really that good?  Apparently some people thought so.  Like some others I am not a Woody Allen fan but I did enjoy the movie.  I thought it was a light, fluffy trifle.  Out of the gate the main set-up of Gil's (a demure Owen Wilson) romantic notions of writing a great novel being met by his fiancee's (the ever-lovely Rachel McAdams, here playing the fascist \\"I-know-what's-best-for-you\\" girlfriend tripe) dismissiveness feels utterly familiar; this mismatch was written as about as loudly on the walls so to speak as a neon Nordstrom's sign blares against the dark nighttime.  So what made this movie click then?  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet but I'll just say that there is a little magic afoot which brings Gil's romantic writer into contact with various literary and artistic historical figures such as Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Dali; the offbeat spirit and portrayal of these characters is a minor delight, perhaps moreso to those viewers who are much more intimately acquainted with them.  The filmography of Paris is gorgeous (and sanitized), a loving ode to the city of light.  And no characters are drawn out to be utterly repulsive (though some of their behavior would be in reality, all is neatly forgiven or waxed over in almost sitcom fashion) so no real sour taste is left in your mouth (or memory).  Like I said, the movie is a light, fluffy trifle.  It's popcorn fare (Kettle corn?) for the arthouse and Woody Allen set I suppose.  Nothing wrong with that.  But a best pic nom?  Really?
1455508977|2.0|I really tried getting thru it, and gave up at about 37%<br />I certainly hope the movie is better.<br />I'm sorry, but most of the same stuff is repeated thru the entire book<br />not to mention, the editing is crap.<br />you have several sentences that are the same words over and over again.<br />this was my first time reading Mr. Sparks, and it was sadly dis-appointing.<br />it goes into the description of the land, and lake and dog kennel in a little too much detail.<br />same thing over and over without getting to the main part of the story.<br />seemed like he had to write just senseless \\"filler\\" to even get the book finished?<br />sadly I don't think I will pick up another one by this author.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this game better than others like it. Others take too long to earn money and this one you can just keep playing and you don't have to wait hours just to continue playing.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|game of the best way to get the most of your life. The creator of the app is the first one to make a decision on timing
B006XIR9KM|5.0|Ever since my son told me there is a free Amazon game of the day, I look forward to checking them out. Not having any &quot;kids&quot; around, most are a total waste of my time.  DoubleTake is great.  I love memory games and I haven't gotten bored yet. Thanks Amazon!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it but not as much as my 4 year old. He cant stop playing its so easy, fun and adorable.  we enjoy this together.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I started listening to Adele a year or two ago.  I have always enjoyed her music.  When I saw it on sale through Amazon, I ordered it.  Outside of the cd case having a crack in it, the music is great!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I didn't know better, I would have thought it was written by a sexually frustrated teenager.  Every other page was about S&M sex or whether to have sex or not.  Wasn't even written well.  Became totally boring about 1/4 of the way in.
B0063IH60K|4.0|lost tract of time playing on my kindle fire. love the one touch moves. will get a lot of enjoyment from this app
0439023521|5.0|Even though I buy lots of books, it is rare that I will read through one in a sitting. I read through the Hunger Games in one sitting. The idea that some have to sacrifice all is an apt theme that resonates in reality. There is also a correlation with society that a lot of people find the carnage amusing! The Hunger Games is a worthy read.
B000VH4OCW|5.0|Songs In The Key Of Life is one of my most favorite works by Stevie Wonder. It is a beautiful work of art. I love it, the songs bring back a lot of good times and special memories. The best thing about MP3 downloads is the how quickly the music is received and enjoyed. The clarity and quality of sound is outstanding. Thank you so much!
B0061S073A|5.0|this is how a kids app should be done.  very easy to use and keeps the kids out of things they aren't supposed to be in.  this is where Android is way ahead of apple.
B004FOA84A|5.0|this is awesome my friends have it almost  all of them have this app!<br />great insperation everyone i  love  it!
0061997811|5.0|Love this! Its got amazing details and so much extra information. I love all the pictures throughout the book. I love it! And the price on amazon definitley beats everywhere else I saw it (plus it was on sale). Also bought \\"Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey\\" at the same time. They go very well together and compliment each other. There are some things missing in this which are in the page to screen book and vice versa. Definitley recommend for Harry Potter fans.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|great game but you have to force close to exit....REALLY needs to be fixed...<br />I would give 10 stars if that were fixed..............
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is great! I originally heard about it taking a bashing on the Today show by two \\"experts\\" that hadn't even read it. I'm glad I discounted it! I couldn't put these books down!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Excellent series with great character development, sophisticated plot and beautiful sets.  Good for adults, not for kids or teens. DVDs contained two episodes per disc.
0345803485|1.0|Considering the sheer number of reviews I won't even bother with a summary of what I actually could stomach to read.<br /><br />Honestly I hated the book entirely. How it could possibly be liked by anyone is beyond me. I purchased the book on my kindle because it was recommended to me by another that was currently reading it. Boy do I regret buying it! The story has absolutely no plot and our lovely heroine is exactly like Bella from the twilight series. I cannot believe the author stole even Bella's habits along with her personality. Christian Grey was a whole different story together, but somewhat made an interesting character. Anyways, I made it about 32% of the book before I just couldn't do it any longer. I tried, my goodness did I try. My biggest problem with the book was the number of pages of legal crap about what the Dominant/Submissive can and cannot do to each other. Absolutely ridiculous.... I want my money back!
0345529057|5.0|Amazing series! I started reading out of curiosity after everyone started talking about how great the TV show was. After the first couple of chapters, I couldn't put it down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not into this kind of lifestyle by any means, but I loved this book.  It is well written, and I could not put it down.  It really gets your attention and you feel so close to Ms. Steele that you want/need to know what will happen next.  I read it in less than a week, and have already downloaded the second one.  If you need a little bit of something to take you away from your normal day - read this book and you will be sucked in.  I love their emails back and forth to one another - so playful and makes me think that I should email/text my husband more and have some fun with it.  It is not only about kinky sex, it is also funny, touching, and tells you about the lifestyle Mr. Grey lives and why.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Reading this book took a day out of my life that I will never get back.  I'm surprised that I actually finished it.  The author is extremely repetitive.  I love a good hot and steamy romance novel but this is flat out porn over and over.  I typically talk like a truck driver, but was surprised how many times she dropped the F-bomb.  I like how descriptive the author is, but HOLY HELL... change it up a bit!  Same sex scene descriptions over and over and OVER!  Same phrases and comments.  Can't forget to mention how completely unrealistic the sex scenes are.  No virgin who was that much sex is going to be able to handle that much, that often.  They wouldn't be walking and would be sore as hell.<br /><br />And who the hell compared this to the Twilight Trilogy?  The only thing it has in common... is that it's a trilogy. Oh... and it's based in the Pacific Northwest.  And if you're going to write about an area, at least use real landmarks.<br /><br />Won't be bothering with the third book!
B005KELQEU|2.0|you sent the wrong cover and have not sent me a no charge return label.<br /><br />contact me @:fgk111@ymail.com<br /><br />I spoke with your pr rep. 3 days ago
1400069181|5.0|This is a very inspirational work that has the power to light a fire in just about anyone to go out and do something significant in the world.  It does a good job of addressing concerns one might have with new ventures, while promoting passion and creativity.  I recommend this to anyone who is seeking greater satisfaction from their lives.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|Smooth video transfer however when accessing a virtual desktop audio does not transfer. Hope this is added on the next update. Otherwise working to expectation.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Yes they are easy to read but the story is awesome. As an adult you take much more from the books and understand the emotions of the characters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's a great read, hard to put down and full of thought provoking ideas and well developed characters.  The story starts with an obvious short story, and each successive piece in the omnibus builds on this bit by bit.  There are some great transitions from character to character as the timeline progresses, and the world is very well thought out.  Every aspect is believable, and well constructed but delivered a piece at a time so you explore the world  as you read the story.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|Wow. Just wow. These dudes have pulled off a miracle. They found the fountain of youth and have made an album that can absolutely stand its ground with their greatest work from the DLR years.<br /><br />They are killing it on this album.
B007BLEXMC|5.0|Love the series Castle.  It is very well produced and keeps you guessing on the outcome. The chemistry between Richard Castle and Kate Beckett is awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The themes throughout the book all the way up to the end were great!
B006XIR9KM|5.0|It is a match game that takes it to a new level of difficulty by moving tiles in you while you are playing
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't wait to move on to the next book so it was ultra convenient to have all three books in the same place.  Amazing story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it so awesome.<br />yes it is.<br />you should play it.<br />yes you should.<br /><br />you really should<br />it is really fun.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This is a wonderful album to just sit, listen to and relax. Scotty's voice is so smooth and seemingly uncomplicated that you drift along with him. There is no \\"listen to how great I am and how big my voice range is\\" attitude with Scotty. What you hear is who he is. Bravo! I followed Scotty's progress on American Idol - the only time I have ever watched the series. I was captivated right from his audition. He is a young man with a HUGE heart and strong moral values. It proved itself week after week. There are more of Scotty's recordings in this grandmother's future and I will definitely watch when in later years he is inducted into the Country Western Hall of Fame.
1451673442|3.0|As much as I enjoyed The Secret and The Power, the book was difficult for me to finish.  There is a few good exercises I personally found helpful, but over all the book is very repetitive.  For the price, it is a decent addition to one's library, but not a necessity.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game lots of fun to play only bad thing is I hate how quickly you run out of energy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is avery fun app and i would advise anyone to get it. sure there are alot of ads but it takes 2 seconds to x out of them. some of the games are challenging but that is what makes it all the more fun. i love the system of getting coins and using it to purchase all the games. this app is really fun
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it and my 3 year old gets a kick out of it too. I would recommend this app.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|Frankly, I am amazed at all the glowing reviews for this movie. John Carter was NOT the \\"EVENT MOVIE\\" I expected it to be. The execution of this production was neither convincing or memorable, especially considering its production costs (estimated at $250,000,000+).<br /><br />Before I went to see John Carter, I was certain I would love it as big budget Sci-Fi/Fantasy/VFX/CGI with live-action movies are very entertaining and immersive if done well. I was disappointed....really disappointed. If anything, the professional critics have given this production more than the benefit of any doubts. The fact that its overall critics rating on Rottentomatoes is at 51% is due (IMHO) to a lot of critics \\"pulling\\" their punches and rating it higher than they normally would (because they like Stanton and his previous work or something else I can't determine). If you actually read many of the positive reviews, they are borderline at best and could easily be classified as negative. The \\"RealMeter\\" rating is probably more like 35%. In fact, the \\"Top Critics\\" have it rated at a weak 34% positive, or just 1 out of 3 liked it.<br /><br />Despite going into the IMAX 3D theater thinking I would love the movie, my rating is a Generous 5 out of 10 for the following reasons:<br /><br />- The experience was not immersive as the cinematography was often blurred and hazy, like everything was shot through a foggy (i.e. 'soft') lens. This effect was especially noticeable when John Carter landed on Mars. The scenery looked like one of those indistinct paintings that old movies used for backgrounds on sets before modern special effects produced more vivid images.  Now this may be what they wanted in the design of the film, but it was neither attractive or comfortable on the eyes. This 'look' continued throughout the film and was very distracting.<br /><br />- The 3D effect was lacking greatly due to poor angles and apparent lack of knowledge or execution in its application. Although there were some opportunities to linger longer on some of the best 3D perspectives shown in the movie (on the river and some expansive scenes), Director Stanton chose to chop the scenes off abruptly before you could enjoy the breathtaking sights.<br /><br />- Stanton's pacing is inconsistent, the movie lurches along from scene-to-scene. His presentation is not nearly as tight as Brad Bird's in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. Some will say this may be caused by the serial nature of his source, Princess of Mars, but I maintain that he should have taken this into consideration in the overall design and editing of the movie and improved upon its flow and momentum.<br /><br />- The action scenes are middling at best, but usually sub-par because they are not smooth in coordination and execution. In what was probably its best action scene, Carter was fighting off a large number of Warhoons while having flashbacks to visions of his wife and child. Unfortunately, the Warhoons had not been properly introduced  to viewers (and they looked a lot like his friendly captors, the Tharks) so many people in the audience were wondering aloud as to why he was fighting his friends.<br /><br />- The action sequences are abysmally short and not convincing. Any detractors of Avatar can say whatever they want, but Cameron's final battle WAS EPIC and tension was developed between each series of confrontations. There is not one epic action moment in all of John Carter. The actors moved around like wooden chess pieces on a board. Extremely disappointing.<br /><br />- The designs of the costumes for the humanoid Barsoomians was ludicrous. They wore Roman-like outfits with feathers on the shoulders and they essentially were indistinguishable from one another. You often could barely (or not at all) tell an enemy from friend during battles making the action confusing at best. This inability to quickly and clearly distinguish between the combatants was very similar to the problem of determining which Martianwas a Warhoon or Thark. The result = a mess of mass confusion.<br /><br />- Stanton is pitiful when it comes to moving his live action actors around the set. I never got the feeling that anything happening on screen was natural. The actors were stiff and he did not position them well, either for maximizing 3D effect, or for conveying any body language or realistic interactions between them. Stanton is good with animations, but not too good with real human beings as his subjects.<br /><br />- There were some moments when I felt embarrassed for the actors and started looking at my watch hoping that their agony would soon end. I distinctly got the feeling that they knew they were performing in one dud of a movie, despite its very large budget. Before the end, they simply seemed like they were going through the motions, with no apparent emotion, looking for a paycheck.<br /><br />- The movie just had an incomplete feel to it, as though it had 2-3 months more to go before the final cut. It seemed to lack the finishing touches needed in post-processing. I am thinking/feeling that the movie was not delayed to make more changes because Stanton had already demanded several re-shoots. Disney executives probably just didn't want to put any more money into it suspecting that it was going to lose money.<br /><br />- Speaking of losing money......there were ~30-35 people (capacity ~350) at the midnight IMAX 3D show I attended and the reaction at the end was one of relief for most of them based on conversations I overheard. After the show, I talked to 3 other men and asked them if they thought it would make money. None of us thought it would net more money than was spent on making it.....0 out of 4. In fact, about three (3) weeks after our conversation, Disney announced that the movie would lose (a write-off) $200,000,000 for the quarter ending March 31.<br /><br />- Overall, this was not the \\"event\\" movie required to get the large number of people or repeat viewers necessary toincrease favorable word-of-mouth marketing. Obviously, based on the many positive reviews here on Amazon, John Carter has fans, but it didn't hold the interest of most normal movie goers looking for a real blockbuster. Apparently, although not too many people who rated the movie on the low side have chosen to post a  review here, the general public did not show up in the droves necessary at theaters to make John Carter a success.<br /><br />On a more positive note, Lynn Collins looked real good and performed well enough overall (although her stumble and fall while running after Carter was poorly done and was illustrative of how stiff and unconvincing some other actors were throughout). The Tharks were interesting but drab in color and appearance. The Tharks were well done motion capture beings and the actors/actresses who perform utilizing this technique are not given nearly enough credit. All too often, a lot of reviews simply state that \\"so-and-so\\" was \\"the voice for\\" one of these characters when, in fact their motions and some of their emotions are depicted very well. If anything, the Tharks and Ms Collins were the brightest stars (to me).<br /><br />Including Edgar Rice Burroughs in the movie at the beginning and end was effective, but Daryl Sabara was way too wide-eyed in his portrayal of the author. I especially liked the way the end was handled, leaving it open for a sequel (or not).<br /><br />Anyway, I saw the movie. I wanted to love it and I tried to like it. I was not impressed.<br /><br />Overall, it looked and felt like an ambitious production that never seemed to fly well because the pilot/director never mastered the controls. Like the \\"match-stick-looking\\" aircraft in the movie, the production has a few moments, but it always seemed to come crashing back to being poorly paced and deadly dull despite the big budget and special effects.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was incredibly disappointing! After hearing so much about the bestseller, I expected it to at least be decent- it was not. The overuse of phrases and words went beyond annoying. Apparently the only term of endearment this author knows is \\"baby\\" and she is generous in its use! I also am not sure how the main character, Ana, even has a lip anymore because it she was biting it every two pages. Maybe that's how she gets her sustanence,  because a major plot point seemed to be how she never eats nor is ever hungry. I lost count of how many times Christian asked her if shed eaten, how much, when....and her replies of nothing and ill just I have tea. Id rather he'd just stop worrying about it and let her waste away so the repetition could stop! I felt no emotional attachment to,  nor did I identify with, any character in any way. I cant imagine how any decent editor could've liked this as even a rough draft; by the end, I was in tears with relief that I finished!
B005COO1X6|2.0|Can you say \\"I'll pass\\"? Then please do. This is one awful short story unworthy of it's author. Mile 81 is an abandoned rest stop on Maine's I-95. A young boy discovers it, along with a half filled bottle of vodka in an abandoned restaurant. He takes some swigs, gets a good buzz and falls asleep.<br /><br />In the meantime a muddy station wagon outside causes very repititious mayhem. The boy, Peter, sleeps through it. In the end he awakens to two very young children. He's witnessed one of the station wagon's deeds. The story then ends. Did Peter dream the whole thing? Doubtful, since the evidence is outside. Actually, I could care less. The story is that bad.<br /><br />There is no character development, plenty of repitition from the car, seemingly no reason for the protagonist, Peter. The story ends very ubruptly leaving the reader scratching his head wondering what did I just sit through?<br /><br />One saving grace, mercifully it's very short. Watch for it to end abruptly at about 75-76%. The rest is a lead in to the new book \\"11/22/63\\". So, the reader becomes cheated there as well.<br /><br />At $3.99, I found that too expensive for this. I'm a King fan, but this is awful

0345803507|5.0|So, one things for sure, I love me some Fifty Shades of Grey. I do have to say if anyone is going to write a review about this book and derail or attract other readers to or from this story, then you really should read all three books to understand the relationship between the characters. First, let me say that every submissive act that Ana shares with Christian is consensual and as you read into the second and third books, Ana can definitely hold her own. I love the characters, the relationship that builds between them is strong and the feelings they have for each other whether its happy, sad, mad, scared, etc. you feel it through the trilogy. I have never read anything like this before, so I was glad to get the e-book first (I just ordered all three paperbacks) cause I found it really hard explaining to my boyfriend what I was reading and what it was about. It does make you warm and fuzzy inside and I found myself blushing quite a few times but I think that is what so many women are loving about this book...it really woke me up inside and I have a better understanding of what I like and don't like and what I might be willing to try in the bedroom with the one I love! Thank you, E.L. James. I can't wait to see what you publish next...
0743581601|5.0|Diane Setterfield knows how to tell a story!!!! I bought the book on audio cd and loved every minute of listening to it. It was paced just right and had the right amount of mystery vs. situations you could predict. The only thing that was not predictable was how the story unfolded itself. Just when you thought you knew where she was going with it all, she took you down another path. I loved the twists and turns of the plot as well as the ending. She is a genius at telling a story within a story without loosing you and tying up all the ends to make it cohesive and enjoyable.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|Funniest light read I have had in years, loved it so much I bought it again & gifted it to my daughter. She also had tears of laughter pouring down her face. Both ended up with sore stomachs laughing. Highly recommend  this book, anyone reading it will become an instant Sophie Kinsella fan!
0439023521|2.0|(spoilers)<br />I have to give my appreciation to the author. It is hard to create a setting with so much potential and completely avoid any kind of drama or interesting development whatsoever. Another author would've had the characters sturggle with the moral mess that the Hunger Games are, would show the dispair and the terror of kids sent to a televised death.<br />But no. Instead, we got Twilight with a fun video-game like setting.<br /><br />The \\"love story\\" had a lot of potential - the constant knowledge that the other might betray you any second, yet the desperation and the terror of the moment overwhelm you so much you throw yourself in any open arms, even if they might strangle you later... yes, I could see potential in that. Yet instead, we got that extremely convenient rule change, which took every bit of drama out of the relationship between Peeta and Katniss and made it boring.<br /><br />Instead of a rough, messed up, and ultimately interesting to watch love story, we got a bitchy Katniss abusing poor Peeta's feelings so she could get some bread soup. Even that had the potential to become interesting, but the author decided to pull a Twilight instead and make Katniss completely undecided about whose arms she liked to cuddle in better. It would've been dozens of times more dramatic if, say, she knew from the beginning that she prefered Gale and she only acted like liking Peeta so as to help her win the game. Perhaps, by the end of the games, she realizes she isn't completely indifferent to Peeta. But no, instead we had to be reminded each time she seemed to go one way or another that she was undecided.<br /><br />I kissed Peeta, BUT I KINDA LIKE GALE TOO. The tought of Gale makes me fuzzy, BUT PEETA GAVE ME BREAD 10 YEARS AGO. That was so sweet, BUT GALE HELPS ME HUNT. That gives my family food, BUT PEETA IS BLOND AND HAWT.\\"<br /><br />I felt like the author tried way too hard to make Katniss conflicted about her feelings, when she could've been way more subtle (and spare us from a couple dozen boring pages). Even Bella realized only in the 4th book that she loved Jake too. Until then, it was hinted at and shown that she wawsn't completely indifferent, but it wasn't outright stated until a few thousand pages later. Here, from the first two chapters we have the love triangle already set up and prepared to be overused to death and beyond by the author.<br /><br />So, besides the love story, the book was good right? An arena where kids have to fight and kill each other... there must be a lot of drama, betrayal and hard choices, right? Right?<br />No, appearently. A good part of the characters are dealt with by other contestants in the Hunger Games. Whoever Katniss starts to feel sympathy for is conveniently killed by some bad guy, who then becomes an acceptable target to kill, which she promptly does.<br /><br />First, I really don't understand why there had to be bad guys\\". At least four psychopaths and most of the other characters are made unlikable enough as to spare poor Katniss from any moral trauma when she murders them. Why were the carrers\\" all bad guys? Risking your life for the wellfare of your district and family seems rather heroic to me. But no, each career is made up to be as a snobby sadistic son of a lady dog who has no morals whatsoever, therefore making it completely morally acceptable for Katniss to massacre them.<br />Why did Peeta have to be a good guy all along\\" and not actually betray Katniss when he joined the Careers? Why didn't Katniss have to kill anyone she didn't have a personal thing against? Why didn't Rue betray Katniss? Why did Katniss befriend Rue in the first place? Why did Thresh, whom Katniss became sympathetic to, have to be conviniently killed by the bad guy? Why did we have that ridiculous rule change which took every tiny bit of drama and potential out of Peeta and Katniss' relationship? Why couldn't Katniss let Peeta die so she might win? Why (on EARTH) did Thresh let Katnissgo? Basically, why did the author do anything humanly possible to take every single potentially interesting bit from the book out, just so her heroine remained morally as clean as a baby's ass?<br /><br />The potential for drama was there and it was huge. We could have had Katniss constantly on the move, constantly alert, scared for her life, hunted by other scared children, suffering the psychological traumas of killing and being hunted, having to kill both friends and enemies, perhaps a part of her even resenting Prim for having gotten her there. But no, she was safe and sound in her trees, always having enough food, her morality protected from any dillema by (appearently) all the gods and men and always having an ally who adored her and who she could feel safe next to.<br /><br />The equivalent of this book is having an helicopter and using it as an air-blower. So much potential, so little of it used...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Super cute and fun, its a great game for being free.  I suggest this game for anyone who likes Mario Bros. games.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an intriguing book, sucking you in until you are finished!  Some great surprises and can't wait to see movie after I finish trilogy!!!<br /><br />Easily read and very entertaining.  Can't imagine how horrible life would be if this were actually a true life experience.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|At first glance, this is just Memory with fancy new graphics. And then the tiles start moving around! And the clock is counting down, so you'd better hurry! And what you thought was just a simple matching game suddenly becomes a serious challenge. You not only have to remember what symbols were where, but you have to track them with your peripheral vision as they start moving around.<br /><br />Studies show that regular mental stimulation can improve your intelligence and help protect against cognitive decline and memory loss associated with aging. This is a great game for exercising your brain. It stimulates your short-term memory, decision-making abilities, and hand-eye coordination. It's also great for \\"warming up\\" your brain prior to an exam, interview, meeting or conference.<br /><br />If you find the game too fast-paced at first, you can start out with Basic mode, which has no time limit and no penalties for mistakes. As your improve, you can move up to Survival mode, which also has no time limit but penalizes errors, then Timed mode, where the clock is reset with each match, and finally Speed mode, where you have only 60 seconds to make as many matches as possible.
B00005LOLD|5.0|A BD of this fantastic and meaningful movie would be a pleasure to own. It's a tremendously underrated movie and I can't understand why. Anyone I show it to loves it. The history of racism and ridiculous regulations that went on in the military is important to know. I agree with the reviewer who said the scene in which Brando meets his lust interest is powerful. Brando's facial expression tells what's going on in his head without words. What an acting job! I'm hoping it's not going out of print.
0307477479|4.0|Jennifer Egan does what most writers can't, which is to tell a story through the eyes of multiple characters with ease. It takes a compassionate soul to exact the voice of sometimes unlikable people and make them likable, to the extent readers plod on through the book, hoping for their redemption. A Visit from the Goon Squad is a story about second chances and life's little reset button that we don't even know is coming, but pray is. Egan masterfully bounces from story to story, linking the characters across generations and locales, reminding us all that the world continues to turn, and we are all linked, whether in vivid memory or a passing happenstance. Written in a contemporary style and sprinkled with rock & roll, Egan achieves again. Great read and worthy of all its accolades.<br /><br />Visit my link here for my own fiction release, available for purchase in paperback or Kindle: [[ASIN:B0053Y1IK4 The Field]]
B004H3WWU2|5.0|Excellent, sleek form with low profile. Great for lugging through airports. This bag is really just for your laptop and a few extra things. Don't expect it to hold what a full-size back pack can. That said, it's well-designed and I can fit a lot into it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is really easy and lots of fun.  it tests how smart you are and you get to have fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read all three books in this series and thoroughly enjoyed each of them. Some of the reviews I read before purchasing said that the second book was dry and slow and not nearly as good as the other two. Well, perhaps .... marginally.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie but - usually - a good book is always much better than the movie even if the movie tries to follow the book as much as possible.<br /><br />I can and do recommend this book and its two follow-up books to anyone who likes a good, fast-moving story. (All you have to do is accept the premise and dig into it.)

B005UDD1R6|1.0|If I have to spend more than 15 minutes on how to use an App I am not interested. I am looking for a simple video player and photo App utility. I don't want to have to be connected to the Internet, create an account, download movies, stream movies, share my videos or photos on the cloud, create play list, log into Facebook or Twitter. I just want to play the videos and slideshow the photos I have copies over to my Kindle. I want and App that will rotate the video and photo from portrait to landscape automatically or with a swipe of my finger. This is not the App I want. Deleted it after messing with it for an hour.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I was deeply moved by Stephen Kings 11/23/63.  I am a baby boomer and thus deeply affected by the assignation of John Kennedy. Now that I am on the gray side of my life I really appreciated this blast to the past.  Though I am not a horror genre junky, Stephen King is a great writer.<br /><br />I love the idea of time travel and who won't want to try and change the past. But it is the wonderful story of Jake Epping/George Amberson the teacher in the sixties that most engaged me and then his battle with the past. I enjoyed the way that King wove the many story lines together to complete a cohesive whole. I appreciated this book, and when I finished I appreciated Stephen King for writing it.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|The book started interestingly enough, but a great deal of it was devoted to descriptions of her family life, her sickness, relationships, country, customs in her country, and redundancy. Once said, she repeated several statements throughout the book. I expected that she would have given us a vehicle providing answers regarding her NDE, and information she learned; but those references were vague and short, or absent. The part dealing with the NDE was especially short. I can say that were she to have written a book on acquainting the reader with her country and customs, this book would have been phenomenal!

B005IT0V8O|4.0|Very good read, very interesting points. I enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning a little more about everything.
B006XIR9KM|3.0|DoubleTake is a glorified matchmaking game with a futuristic-styled theme and electronic background music. There are four different play modes; each of which has you racing a clock to sift through several overturned tiles (by touching them)to find a matching pair of icons before you move on to the next pair. Bonus points are granted for getting \\"combos\\" by finding multiple pairs in a row without incorrectly guessing in between. To add to the difficulty of finding matches, the tiles sometimes shift along the grid and disappear randomly.<br /><br />I played for a bit, but the game couldn't quite hold my attention. This one might be better for a younger crowd, or possibly someone that wants to get some memory exercise.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great strategy game. Phone freezes sometimes when I exit out of the game,  but otherwise no complaints. It's even better on the iPad.
B006XIR9KM|1.0|Great game.  I love this game.  Works perfectly on my Fire 8.9 HD.  I can play it for long periods of time.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|This is a must have as a part of your Adele collection as this video captures the true essence of Adele at one of her best unforgetable performances with explaination and thoughts on her work.  When I first saw it I decided to purchase it and recommend it to anyone who is an avid fan of hers.  If you are not a fan you will be by the end of the show and you can see her capture and captivate her audience with her charm, sense of humor, her emotions, and of course her voice.  This is a masterpiece!
B002PDBA90|4.0|The tracks on this disc are remnants of studio and interesting experiments. It is worthwhile for those who like the band know something a little different and well done, amazing. Do not recommend it as the first disk to have the band, but worth much to those who already know and like. Very good!
044024630X|5.0|This is a terrific read. I love the details Child puts into his stories. One leg is shorter than the other so that is why we tend to walk in circles when we are lost in the woods. Really? I mean, how good is that! Yeah, the ending was a bit quick on the wrap up department, but given the purpose of the book--to explain how Reacher got to be Reacher--no other ending was really possible or plausible. And yeah, that's how the military works. Just ask those guys who got busted in Cartagena.

B001AI1Q9U|5.0|His first \\"Classic\\". One of the strangest rock LPs ever recorded made better thru Japanese tech. I've had almost every version of this recording including the original Island (UK) LP, but I must say that this Japanese version is the best digital copy out there without question. Fripp & Manzaneras guitars sing...
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Critics don't like this movie because they expect it to dwell at length on the political philosophy and on the issues Margaret Thatcher dealt with as prime minister of Britain. They expect the Iron Lady to be a glorified docudrama, but that is not what this film is. It is the story of the personal life of Margaret Thatcher before, during, and after her tenure as prime minister. By that measure, and by virtue of Meryl Streep's acting skill, it is a jolly good show.
0545265355|5.0|Almost as good as Harry Potter! Suzanne Collins is a great writer and this is a great set of books.

B00006AUIG|3.0|Based on the glowing reviews here at Amazon, I was expecting much more from this psychological horror film.<br /><br />Ultimately I felt that the pieces of the story don't quite fit together.<br /><br />Nevertheless the film does offer one compelling reason to view it: the behind-the-scenes look at the now demolished Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts, home of the notorious prefrontal lobotomy and quite a remarkable piece of architecture.<br /><br />Those interested in mental health, history, and architecture may find this location alone worthy of attention.  Those seeking a superior psychological thriller, however, can find much better examples than this film.

B007N5YIUS|1.0|Installed with no problem. Click the icon, the screen goes black and that's it. The Home button will not clear it, cannot back out of it; totally frozen. Only way out is resetting the phone. I tried clearing the cache and restarting the game. Same. Uninstalled.
0060005424|5.0|Lirael lives in a glacier of women who are gifted with seeing the future. They are called the Clayr and their soul focus is the Sight (what they call seeing the future). Although Lirael is a Daughter of the Clayr, she has classified herself as an oddity amongst her community. While other Clayr are tall, with light blonde hair and skin the color of nutmeg that tans. Lirael has dark hair and skin that burns out in the sun, and if that wasn't the only thing that makes her stand out. There is also the sore point of her being Sightless. Not being able to see the future. Not being able to be properly accepted as a Clayr. Over time she takes steps to distract herself from not having the Sight and is put into a position at the Great Clayr library. Where she loses herself in discoveries and a secret destiny that is hidden from her.<br />Her journey is ahead and accompanying her is her faithful companion, the Disreputable Dog. But, as they continue a new character, Sameth, and Mogget, the sarcastic ever so helpful cat joins them. This book shows Lirael grow into becoming a determined and strong individualf from the first hurtful moments in her life to the stand alone \\"I can do this and I will\\" attitude. I truly don't see Sameth growing up into his position of office until the next book, Abhorsen.<br />What I also enjoyed from this book, is that you get a much broader spectrum of Charter magic. Its combinations and what it can do. It was very enjoyable reading how it was used in the Clayr's glacier and etc, etc...<br />I definitely recommend this book. However, if you haven't read the first book, Sabriel. You might want to pick that up first. There are not many references to Sabriel's battles. But, it will help you understand more about the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre, and how the two co-exist.

The romance was frustrating slow between Charles and Sophia, but understandable.  I can't wait for the next installment.  I would love to see this in movie format, especially the war.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I saw this game and as I always do I read the reviews. Most were bad and said they hated the game. I fully disagree. I love the game and I am already totally addicted. I reccomend this game to almost anybody.<br />Hannah age 12
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This is a fun game but it stopped working after updating.  I've tried everything to open but nothing works.  I clink on it, it comes up saying 'checking for updates' and then it closes.  Only thing I can think would be to delete & then redownload game. i'm totaled fed up.  They get you into game you spend money then NOTHING.  What a RIP OFF!!!!
B005FLX2WC|1.0|Once again = I order a Joe Bonamassa CD from Amazon and the plastic container is broken.  That makes 3 and 0.<br />The CD is fine and not scratched but I do not think I will be ordering from Amazon any more
B003H9M1Q2|4.0|DUMBO is such a nice story...It´s a total classic from DISNEY, and everyone in the world should take a look at this piece of art! DUMBO is from a time where people actually draw the cartoons without ANY COMPUTERS!!!WOW!This is art!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I can't recall the last time I bought a record where I loved the whole thing from top to bottom,  every song  a surprise and a smile.  This is my new favorite record,  beautiful music,  amazing vocals and melodies.  Love Is A Four Letter Word is in the company of the classic records of Cat Stevens,  George Harrison,  James Taylor...
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|All I have to say about this show is that it is AMAZING. I have never seen such a good show. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This is why I don't accept self published material for the blog. It 95% of the time results in my having to read unedited navel-gazing literature that has might have been potential.
B000A2UBN4|5.0|I really enjoy Robert De Niro as an actor...he really brings something to his characters...CAPE FEAR must be one of the coolest De Niro movies...this film is a great classic....WELL DONE, DE NIRO!!!!!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|really fun game!quite addictive and the animation and sound effects are good. Glu makes good games even though the ads get a little annoying but its not so much that it ruins gameplay
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. nice graphics, cute animals. easy game play. you earn cash pretty quick so there isnt a lot of waiting around.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is one of the best or greatest ever it is one of the best or greatest ever super cool love it
B005J7K964|5.0|Kudos to Kino for releasing this.  From my memory 3 decades ago when I saw the Moroder version of Metropolis in the Georgia Tech student theater, the version on the blu-ray feels the same as that print.  As other people here have pointed out, this isn't a restoration, it is just a blu-ray copy.  So there is a little jerkiness here and there, a little blur, and a little grain.<br /><br />Actually I'm grateful for this lack of diddling since it means that Kino didn't diddle with the version that I like.<br /><br />I also have the much longer, much slower, complete Kino version.  I just finished watching the Moroder version and I find that it is a much more watchable film that that other versions (note that there are many versions of Metropolis floatin around, so I won't confuse the issue by discussing more than these two).<br /><br />Some people may not like the colorization (tinting), but according to the documentary on film restoration (in the Extras section) that tinting process was popular at one point and I find that it does indeed help make the film a little more watchable compared to the stark gray-scale version.  Likewise, other folks complain about the 80's music, but I like the music very much and feel that it helps hold the story together versus some generic orchestration.<br /><br />That, combined with the film's faster run-rate, makes it a more watchable film than the much longer slower versions of Metropolis.  I'm sure that Kino will come out with a cleaned-up restored Moroder version in a couple years, and I'll buy that one also.<br /><br />I believe that Metropolis (specifically this Moroder version) presents a very powerful message.  Especially in this day and age when we sit 10 hours per day in front of \\"the machine\\" (the one that you are sitting in front of right now).<br /><br />Scott<br /><br />PS  be sure to watch the film restoration documentary in the Extras section.
0553386794|4.0|2,378 reviews so where to start, eh? Here's the short version. The Game of Throne books have some INCREDIBLE content, but it's inter-mixed with hundreds of pages of tedious, repetitive and ultimately unnecessary dialogue. This isn't to say that well-written dialogue does not advance a fantasy storyline. But in THIS case it's excessive to the extreme.<br /><br />The best way to read these books is to SKIM through most of the tedious dialogue and savor the action scenes.<br /><br />'Nuff said.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|I thought it would be easier than it is.  Something new is always fun.  I would recommend it to friends.
0307588343|4.0|It would be ridiculous to assume that this is going to be an objective fly-on-the-boardroom-wall view of the collapse of Wall Street. No-one who was touched by it can fail to be dispassionate about it, and this is far from being dispassionate. McDonald's prejudices and political opinions are not mine - but I can still give this book four stars. It was written by someone in the trenches, fighting battles whose strategies were determined not by him, but by others with whom he had little contact.<br /><br />For people who know a little about finance, this is a great opportunity to learn more about what was going on, at the level of the trading floor, at least, in language that is easily understandable. Maybe it lacks the good humour of Michael Lewis' \\"Liar's Poker\\", but then this is not a lighthearted subject. The story of trillions of dollars of taxpayers' money going to rescue those reckless gamblers who were deemed to be \\"deserving\\" (AIG and their chief counterparties) while leaving others (Lehman) to fall to the ground is not a cheerful one.<br /><br />The writing style definitely has its moments - I enjoyed the description of the mortgage desk taking their afternoon strolls on the lake in Central Park, for example. Sometimes a little too cute for its own good, perhaps, but I can imagine sitting down with McDonald over a drink or two and listening to him telling these stories in these words.<br /><br />Not the only book you should read on the mortgage scam of the 2000s. Nor do you have to agree with every conclusion in it. But it is one of the \\"must-reads\\" on the list if you want to know how the world economy melted down a few years back.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|I thihk the cover could have been much better. Can also say the same for my last marriage. However, some of those characters in Teen Wolf looks like someone I was married to. Sounds like her too. But I think it was a great show and look forward to the next series. Liked Tyler Posey as Raul in Doc...but, they all grow up. And of course, Tyler Hoechlen(sic) was great in 7th Heaven and Road to Perdition. Great show. I never pictured these two later on playing this genre.
141694740X|3.0|Well, I have to admit that this isn't the GREATEST book on planet earth, it's really funny, tough, but I will recomend this to someone who likes to laugh :)
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I enjoyed this novel tremendously. It's like stringing beads: every next chapter takes a protagonist from the previous chapter and describes an event in his or her life. Very well done. Very intelligently done. Very enjoyable. About people in our era. Their vanities and hang-ups and weaknesses.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game kind of lonh but like if you know how to play it is okay really but not five stars judt four
B007URVZJ6|5.0|When I decided I wanted to publish on the Kindle, I went to their very extensive information pages on self-publishing. So much information! I combed through a lot of it but still hadn't found everything I needed when this e-book popped up in my recommendations.<br /><br />This is a short and precise explanation of all a writer needs to know to publish onto the Kindle. It is all for Microsoft Word users - I don't know if they have another version for other word processing programs or if you could extrapolate from the Word instructions. I haven't actually published my book yet, so I can't say for sure how correct all the instructions are, but they are extremely exact: \\"Click 'Insert' at the top of the screen in Word....\\" etc.<br /><br />The book starts with a \\"Before You Write\\" chapter that tells you exactly what not to do while you're actually writing your book - things like, \\"Avoid using tabs and spaces to indent paragraphs and icons.\\" It then proceeds to tell you what exactly how to form your paragraphs (using Word's Page Layout feature).<br /><br />There's also a very good synopsis of how to form your cover art. It took me a long time to even find references to this issue on the Amazon website, but this book very clearly and succinctly tells you everything you need to know. (The picture needs to be a jpg or tif file, at least 1000 pixels on the longest side, and the height-to-width ratio should be about 1.6.)<br /><br />Also included are info on how to create your table of contents, how to insert illustrations into the main book, etc. Then on to how to convert your Word file into html and how to upload it onto Amazon.<br /><br />The whole thing is very well written. Very clear and doesn't waste your time. Excellent technical writing.<br /><br />Downloading this \\"book\\" (really the length of a magazine article) is a no-brainer since it's free. But don't just download it for future reference -- read it before you look at the Amazon Self-Publishing page information and indeed before you start typing out your book.<br /><br />Update: I am now uploading various short stories, with and without pictures, to see how everything works. The only part of \\"Building Your Book\\" I didn't understand was the \\"Books with Images: Creating a zipped file of your book contents.\\" The writer said, \\"1) Go to the folder where you saved your book...\\" I thought, how in the world does he know whether or not I put my book in a folder? It turns out, though, that, when you convert the file to \\"Web Page, Filtered\\" (which he explains very clearly beforehand), and then make a zip file (which he also explains), Word will automatically form two files, just as he describes them. He just doesn't tell you that Word will do this. Also, if your book has pictures (other than the cover art), I would highly recommend \\"Pictures on Kindle\\" by Aaron Shepard. It's technical, but if you want to insert pictures into Kindle properly, this book is a great help.d indeed before you start typing out your book.<br /><br />Update: I am now uploading various short stories, with and without pictures, to see how everything works.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|What does this app need access to my contacts for?  Clearly, this app will send a list of my friends to the Ninja union, and they will be targeted for termination.  Uninstalling spyware.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Tried to load this game on my kids' Cruz T100...no good.  Won't run. :-(  Maybe it's time to come up with a better way to figure out what will work on a particular device.  the compatability window said it was good...but it also said Angry Birds would work too and no-go on it either.  Come on Amazon...Really????
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is really fun on the Kindle Fire. It is pretty easy to figure out also. I recommend it to all ages.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I'm giving this 3 stars because it did exactly what it's supposed to. The build quality isn't great, and the instructions aren't terribly clear in any of the 10 languages provided, but I was able to muddle through with other comments here and it worked just fine.<br /><br />And...I couldn't tell much of a different in the sound quality, either with Bose (yes, I know) earbuds or my Sennheiser HD202's. The middle EQ or no EQ settings are best, but I couldn't tell the difference between the headphone amp eq and tweaking the source eq.<br /><br />I think you have to know your ears for this kind of thing. If you rip everything to flac and  256bit mp3's are like fingernails on a blackboard to you, you would probably get something out of this. My ears just can't tell a difference, so I returned it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book to Hunger Games did not disappoint!  Could not put it down.  I had to know what would happen next.  Kept you on the edge of your seat.  Filled with adventure and a few twists.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The transition from disfunctional to functional among the characters is wonderfully acted.  I would have voted for this movie to be Best Movie at the Academy Awards.
B000005YZM|5.0|For all those who already own and appreciate this album, I suggest buying Odessey And Oracle: The 40th Anniversary Concert DVD.  Recorded in 2008 at London's Shepards Bush Empire, the surviving members of the band recreate the entire album in order.  In addition, there is another section of Zombies/Argent/Blunstone material.  Look up this DVD and read the reviews for further edification.<br /><br />O&O has been one of my favorite albums since 1970.  In my opinion, the concert DVD version is better, but if not better, at least revelatory to fans of the album. I've probably watched it 15 times and it always bathes my brain pan in serotonin. I would watch<br />the Odessey & Oracle part first, then go on to the Zombies touring band material.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very like a Zynga game in play stile. in app purchases are pushed.  the exit is not obvious- bring up settings and the home button will appear. though I found customer support button exited faster, It dumps you to the web. I recommend playing while plugged in as you have no idea your battery is low til you are watching you kindle fire shut down.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the first few chapters, up to the first sex scene. Awful just awful writing. Don't understand the popularity of this book.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is one of Woody Allen's best films.  I would rank it with Hanna and Her Sisters, Manhatten, Annie Hall and Match Point.  It is good to see that the master still has his touch.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Great spy novel! It's been, of course, a long time since it was first published, but the book still preserves its validity as a good novel and the tension within the plot is still there. It just took me back to \\"iron curtain\\" times.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Band right out of the box keeps popping open.  used the tool to fix but plastic is flawed!  I have 'fixed' it three times now - it seems secure and comes right out.  Very frustrating!
B007VPLNGW|5.0|This game is the type of game to play on the go, and despite its childish cover, it is fun for all ages and will make you think. Better than Angry Birds for sure. Definitely buy it! At $.99 there's no reason not to buy it!
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|this movie is so cute im watch it over and over with my grandkids who i bought it for it is well worth the money
B007549W62|2.0|Rented this from Redbox last night and although it started out rather cheesetastically, the mystery built after one of the characters was kidnapped from the cellar the characters are trapped in. Sadly, this one big mystery is never addressed ever again and instead, the movie descends into complete madness.<br /><br />It's one of those movies that makes you wonder how the actors can do what they did. I love apocalyptic fiction, but tend to find the psychotic aspect that some of these stories focus on to be extremely disturbing, disgusting, and just not for me. For example, the cannibal cult in Lucifer's Hammer or the department store freaks (though to be fair, those guys escaped from an asylum) and Macklin's camp in Swan Song. Perhaps I just have more faith in humanity, but the idea that people can be reduced to such animalistic, psychotic behavior makes my skin crawl.<br /><br />The Divide brings this exact type of creepy crawly feeling to life. I watched in horror as things just got worse and worse. It's an interesting psychological thriller that examines the basic human emotions and instincts such as love, jealousy, courage, and the need to survive but ultimately came down to what felt like a confusing mess. As I mentioned, a big mystery is revealed relatively early on and then is never, ever addressed again. If this was going to be the case, the mystery should never have been introduced in the first place.<br /><br />I was led to believe that this mystery was where the movie was going and it seemed really interesting, but the movie ended up being about human depravity and psychological torture. Not unworthy of a rental, but certainly not a movie I will ever willingly watch again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its cool and awsem you can make families. there's diffrrnt kind of animals and there fifteenth colors. you can watch a mini movie
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Another amazing album from Halestorm.  Every song is great.  Definitely worth the 5 bucks!<br /><br />I really enjoyed their first studio album \\"Halestorm\\" and this one doesn't dissapoint.  It keeps the authentic Halestorm sound from track to track while keeping the flow unique to each song....just simply amazing...this band is way underrated in my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|xoxox. you should try it cool game lovez&lt;3 5 star for me. try it on your kindle really good picture fun not hard like other games. :)
B006P0FIGU|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of time.  The characters were unbelievably unrealistic, and over dramatized.  If I were ever to try to watch it again, I would have to try and look at it as a comedy rather than an action film.  I've seen 5 different versions of the 3 musketeers, and this is by far the worst.<br /><br />If you want a decent 3 musketeer movie, look for the Disney version titled \\"The Three Musketeers\\", starring Tim Curry, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, and Rebecca De Mornay.
0545265355|5.0|The books were brand new and arrived much quicker than I had thought they would.  The books are great and I would recommend them to everyone!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Some say this is the tamest of the trilogy, but I find it very exciting. Is she alive or near death? Read the book. Does she score big? Read the book. In someways, I find this much like John D. McDonald's Travis McGee novels. That is, when it comes to the endings.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game keeps you busy. you have to unlock the levels but fun game. enjoys all the different games and boards.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|I just downloaded this as the Free App of the Day.  After playing a couple of games in Basic mode, I can say I'm very impressed with this game.  The graphics are good and it's perfect for the smaller screen on a smartphone.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S II and it's very easy to play.  I've noticed some android games are a bit difficult to play on smaller touchscreen, but this isn't one of them.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a matching game that makes you focus and test your brain a bit more than usual.
B006OB3K56|5.0|I am giving this movie 5 stars because I found the performances amazing, BUT it isn't for everyone so I think people should rent it before they decide on buying it. I am pretty upset about the digital copy, which is only transferable on an Android platform from the DVD. Really annoying for MAC users, especially since the code insert gives misleading instructions for MAC transference. I called the 1-800 number on the blu ray case, and the Fox Digital customer service representative told me it was a \\"title\\" issue (not sure what that means) and put me on a waiting list to be contacted when the problem is resolved. I did ask them if the digital copy was unavailable on MAC platform because of legal issues between Fox and Apple, and the representative firmly denied it -- but who knows? He could have just been blowing smoke at me. Anyway, I'll keep y'all updated on whether FOX coughed up my digital copy for my MAC.<br /><br />******************************************UPDATE***********************************************************<br />Four days later,  I got the same response as other reviewers:<br /><br />Dear Valued Customer,<br /><br />Thank you for your email. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience but unfortunately, Fox is not able to offer an iTunes Digital Copy for Shame. The digital copy can be transferred to a compatible Android device or a Windows PlaysForSure-compatible PC or portable media player.<br />Should you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at 888 223 4369 between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm PST and a Customer Care representative will be more than happy to assist you.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Customer Care<br /><br />Although I am happy to have this movie on blu-ray, I find that Fox's actions are pretty deplorable and misleading. Lesson learned. I'll have to read the digital copy description more carefully before I make purchase next time. I did find out that Shame is available on iTunes so if you REALLY want the digitalcopy and own a MAC, then you still have options.
B005CC0CMC|5.0|The order came promptly, the novels are complex more extensive than the HBO series, Game of Thrones.<br />Mankind's desire for power with many characters, with powerful women and men.  Great read for those who enjoy historical novels with fantasy!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I downloaded this app when it was free, but I would have bought it had I known what I could do with this app. I have literally played video games on my computer at home while in class, from my phone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the story and was very glad that i had ordered all three at the same time read them all in three days
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love ot the only issue i have with it is wen it comes to visiting the neighbors it says i need to update the game but it is updated does anyone know wat would help?
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works as if it were on your computer - flawlessly and transparently.  Also organizes your downloads for easy retrieval. Great Value and offers backup to Kindle's native process.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|THIS GAME WILL CATCH YOUR ATTENTION AND YOULL WANT TO PLAY ALL DAY LOVE IT. LOVE IT.LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|Of Mice and Men is one of the best books I've ever read! It's about friendship, racism, sexism, contrasts, etc. It's a very unique book and doesn't have a \\"happily ever after\\" ending, it's very unique. I won't spoiling anything, read it!
B004SC7B6M|5.0|I was skeptical about this latest album when I heard that it would be based on a comic they created, I thought how symphonic and gothic can an album be based on a comic? Then I thought to myself, well, each new album keeps getting better than the last one, so I bought it and listened to it and I was astounded. This is now my all-time favorite album from WT. I got the Special Edition and good thing I did cause the extra tracks were just as awesome. Each time WT puts out an album it never fails, outdoing the last album each time. My favorite tracks are \\"Faster\\" (#11 Netherlands), \\"Iron\\", \\"Sinead\\" (#37 Austria), \\"A Demon's Fate\\", \\"Stairway To The Skies\\", \\"I Don't Wanna\\", and \\"Empty Eyes\\".
B0054N73EY|4.0|say, 3 to 4 songs too long, otherwise a reasonably good effort to say the least.  several excellent songs, definitely.  i only heard 'stadium arcadium' of rhcp and this one is certainly not that good but is not bad either.  no regret in having it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I enjoy the &quot;ville&quot; games on facebook. all the ones similar to them on the kindle fire I have seen so far are cheaply made knck offs. I was so happy to discover this free app because it is just like facebooks zynga games and cute for little ones too :)
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Lots of bugs. You can not get out of the game on a kindle fire without shutting down the device. The settings button inside the game did not work either, as other user was suggesting. I had to uninstall the game. Please fix!
0345803485|1.0|I picked up the sample chapter of  FSOG for my Kindle and all I can say is e[...]  I don't get the attraction.  The writing is cliche, the style tried, and the characters completely unappealing.<br />If you want something of worth to read that I loathe to call similar, check out The Marketplace series by Laura Antoniou.  It's a decision I don't think anyone would regret.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book tells the story of a Jewish girl in 1942 Paris, who was rounded up with her family, to be sent to the death camps. It also tells the story of a journalist in Paris who learns of this child while investigating the Velodrome d'Hiver incident.<br /><br />The shift in time, from 1942 to 2002 stops abruptly when the child discovers and accepts that she is the only remaining member of her family. At his point, the journalist doggedly follows the trail left by the child, until ultimately, she is reconciled to the fate of this girl.<br /><br />This is a marvelous story, gripping in its tenacity and the depth of the journalist's drive to bring closure.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Since I was from Sturgis, SD home of the bike rally, this was like going home.  Good to see they aren't all bad, I can't wait for season 4.
1878424319|5.0|Some of this book seemed strange at first, as it is a toteltics story. I don't agree with how he relates about God, but at least he acknowledges him! But the agreements themself, are life changing! Wish I could afford a book for all my friends, If you only focus on the agreements, it will change your life, if only the whole world could live like this!!!!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|this is great app for aggressive playing or just casual. I like this app a lot and play it often.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|This game has a nice pace to it. Said it had a lazy mode? Didn't see it.<br /><br />Definitely better than a run of the mill, turn card over, match it game (don't like that game, so that was a relief). I like that there are a limited number of shapes to begin with,  then more are added, nice touch.<br /><br />Works your brain a little bit, but not too much, overall fun game. Get that lazy mode in there for 5 stars.<br /><br />One more thing. I would like to play a little longer on each game without needing to have superman skills (with exception to the one minute timed game.)
031237593X|5.0|I've probably read over a hundred historical fiction novels and this one is easily in the top 5, maybe top 3. Hard to keep a 900+ page book fresh and interesting but I would have been fine with 500 or so more pages of this excellent story.<br /><br />What I appreciate most about Penman's books is her effective use of dialogue and the economy of words she uses to describe setting and characters. To me one of the true tests of a good book is whether the dialogue comes across to me as something the characters would actually say. Nothing bothers me more than when I read dialogue that is clearly used to pass along a fact to me, when it's obvious the character would never say it in the context or setting he or she happens to be in (for example, to other characters who would clearly already know it).<br /><br />Other novelists could learn a lot from the deft way Penman lays out settings and introduces characters. Many other writers give extensive, detailed descriptions of places and people before these places and characters have a chance to take on life in the reader's mind. I prefer to be given a sparse description, and to be allowed to paint the picture in my own mind, and allow characters and settings to take shape as events and the characters' actions unfold.<br /><br />The Sunne in Splendor story is very fascinating,  the many characters interesting and unique, and the book is extremely well written. Despite its length it is not too difficult a read, even for non-hardcore historical fiction fans. If you're not interested in the historical facts surrounding the story, there's plenty of basic drama and intrigue to keep you riveted. My guess is you will become interested in the historical aspects quickly and, like me, be tempted to turn to other sources to find out more about these extremely fascinating people.<br /><br />I was also very interested to observe many parallels between this story and the Game of Thrones novels, having recently completed reading that series.I don't know how much the author of that series (Martin) was influenced by Penman's writing but I have to believe that Sunne in Splendor was a major source of inspiration.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I have average sized hands for a male (I can't palm a basketball) but most DSLRs feel small when I use them - especially with a pro telephoto lens or zoom attached. With my 50D's, I purchased them with a grip so I never used them without one. I didn't realize that having it attached (with 2 batteries) gave me better control, incredible battery life and better overall balance. With the 7D grip comes added heft too but I found that if I use lithium AA batteries, it seems a little lighter. I think the difference in weight is not worth the cost (lithium AA's cost about $2.50 each) but you may not so that's my weight saving tip.<br /><br />There is also a second shutter release for \\"portrait\\" shooting - I'm not sure I will use it since I like holding the camera by the sides and using the standard shutter button (hey, gimmie a break - I've been shooting like this since my college daze).<br /><br />Despite the fact that the grip isn't actually made in Japan, it's still well made and has that typical Canon quality.<br /><br />If you shoot a lot with a long telephoto/zoom and want the benefit of really long battery life, get the BG-E7 and a spare battery. You won't be disappointed.
B0014J8D9Q|2.0|Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman play two retired wild west bounty hunters, back in their saddles to chase one last bounty after decades of silence. Agonizingly slow, its two leads take their sweet time collecting their belongings, mounting their horses and trotting at a leisurely pace across state lines, sharing less than a few sentences along the way. We gather that Eastwood was a shady character in his day, reformed by the love of a deceased wife, but he seems more like a caged animal than a redeemed spirit and we're never given much reason to pull for him despite the presumed change of heart. Though his beloved bride's spirit lives on in the couple's two young children, he barely acknowledges their presence before leaving them on their own for a month to randomly hunt a new bounty. Freeman tries to drag some character development out of him on the trail, but Eastwood holds onto it with an icy grip and piercing eyes, and there we sit for the rest of the picture. Gene Hackman is noteworthy for his portrayal of a smarmy, cocky town sheriff with a chip on his shoulder, but on every other count this is a western that misses with each squeeze of the trigger. Despite a few beautiful panoramas, the world feels stiflingly tight and compressed. Outside of Hackman, there's no fire and passion in the cast, even when Eastwood turns the page and transgresses to his wilder young persona. Finally, the atmosphere, crucial to all films of the genre, feels too clean and polished where it should be gritty and dirty. Much as I would have loved to see Clint don that familiar parka and revisit the days of his Sergio Leon sunrise, it's just not happening here.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|I was very excited to see this film, as I think the idea was excellent.  But somehow, it fell short and I didn't say 'wow' at the end.  It was more like, 'Huh. Interesting.'  Surprisingly, however, Timberlake is a good actor, and I will definitely see other films that he works on in the future.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great for all ages and great at anytime! I recommend for those times when you need a break from your books!
044024630X|3.0|I have now read 15 of the 16 Reacher novels, and in my opinion this is one of the lesser efforts. It seems we are at the point now where the present day Reacher is over 50, and cannot possibly have the strength and sharpness of his younger days, so the author is backfilling with R's Army days. That's OK, but I just couldn't suspend disbelief enough to enjoy this trip back to the late 1990's.<br />In all of the series it seems Reacher gets away with murder a lot, often with the knowledge and approval of local, armed forces, or federal police. This is getting old. There should be heavy consequences. Also, I can't remember any book where Mr. R loses a fight, whether it's \\"3 Rangers\\" or x number of hillbillies. Furthermore, he goes in knowing he's going to pulverize/eliminate whoever it is. He uses the head butt and the killer elbow a lot, and there's always a description of the killing effect of such mass in motion.<br />Some readers have complained of the excessive detail in descriptions of mundane things. (the coffee...) I think this is one of the better things about the series, and it shows diligence in research.<br />It seems that Big Jack does a lot of things in this one that exceed his orders, to the point of a dishonorable discharge, after the caper resolves itself.  Still, it's a Reacher novel, and I'll always be drawn by Child's name on the spine. I hope the next one will be better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The absolute best book I have read.  Incredibly romantic.  Suspenseful. Sexually educational. Great from the very first page.  Author is an expert at pulling you right into the story as if you are there and living it.  You will fall in love with Fifty and Anastasia.  There IS a lot of erotic content.  You are pulled right into the relationship, kind of like a 'fly on the wall'.  I found it extremely tasteful because of the love relationship between Fifty and Anastasia, and I am not at all squeamish.  Love the communication between Fifty and Anastasia.  Best love affair ever.  I have heard people arguing against this book because of the sexual content and the youth of Anastasia.  My opinion, I wish I had been read this book when I was 20, I had already been married by then.  The communication between Fifty and Anastasia is encouraging.  We should all be that open and in tune with the ones we love.  And as far as the erotic content, it is like a manual.  Perfect.  Couldn't love this book series more.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!! Bared to You hooks you immediately. To say that I love this book is an understatement. Can I buy a Gideon clone? Maybe a birthday present or Christmas, I can be patient. I have to add that I have found a new favorite author and will be following the Crossfire series.<br /><br />I think my favorite thing was that Gideon and Eva weren't perfect. They both started off not wanting a relationship, and it was nice watching them gradually move into one. They both made mistakes, although I'd have to say Gideon's made me shake my head and go \\"really, did you just do that?\\" I loved Eva, probably because she wasn't perfect. Eva had some issues from her past that affected her relationship with Gideon. Not to leave Gideon out, but I am not 100% sure what his issues are; although I hope to find out. I would love to see a novella from Gideon's point of view. This book has some of the hottest sex scenes I have read. I could almost be positive I seen steam coming out of my kindle. I liked that their relationship didn't always take a straight path, that it was curvy and backtracked along the way.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the next in the series and how it's going to move forward from here. The next one will definitely be on my bookshelf.<br /><br />I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|great update, but at the same time its released here another update 1.4.4 is also available for Rio...<br /><br />I'd install this one first rather than skipping over just in case skipping we fail to get essential code from this update.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have no idea what is going on with so many negative reviews of this series. If you don't like the sample, then don't buy the book!<br /><br />Anyway, that being said, of the three books in the series this was the one that kept me pushing my Kindle buttons so fast that I sometimes found myself accidentally skipping sections. The story is more fleshed out (sorry) than the others and there is definitely a bit more character developement, romance, suspense, and fun reading.<br /><br />This isn't \\"Gone With the Wind\\" or \\"Twilight\\", or some award winning novel. Give me a break. It's pulp fiction, plain and simple. If you're not into some of the graphic sex - skip the pages! But please quit complaining and whining and return to your copy of \\"Wuthering Heights\\".
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The story begins in an obscure coffee shop near the Pondicherry Zoo. The supposed author meets a man who offers to tell him a story that will \\"make him believe in God.\\"  After telling him the story, the man, known as mamaji, offers to lead him to the boy named Pi who novel is about. Then the introduction ends and the real story begins.<br />This story is split into three parts. The first part is telling about Pi's childhood in the town of Pondicherry, India. Pi was raised Hindu, but became a Christian and a Muslim, simultaneously practicing all three religions. Even though he is such a faithful child, he doesn't dislike Atheists. In fact he respects them. It's Agnostics Pi has a problem with. When all three of his religious instructors meet up at once, he defends his practices by saying he just wants to love God. They, embarrassed, decide to let him eventually choose which religion is the best.<br />Part one begins to wind down when political problems force Pi's father, the zoo keeper, decides to sell the zoo animals and move to Canada. Part two begins when their ship, the Tsintum, sinks, leaving Pi trapped on a life boat with a wounded zebra. In his hysteria, he tries to save a 450 pound Bengal tiger from sinking, but, realizing his mistake, tries to knock him back off, to no avail. He wakes up the next morning and can't see the tiger, but only the zebra and mysteriously a hyena. He assumes that the tiger must have gotten off the boat. He then saves a mother-like orangutan, floating on a pile of bananas. The hyena then kills the zebra and the orangutan and Pi thinks he is next, only to discover that the tiger was still on the boat. The tiger kills the hyena, and Pi knowing he can't outlast or defeat the tiger, decides to try and keep him alive by developing a relationship with the tiger.<br />The pace of this novel is uneven, fast in some places, but slow in others. Still the tension of the fast paced parts kept me reading through the slower. Yann Martel, the author gives lots of character development, making me feel as if I knew Pi from his birth. An example of this is how the author describes not only the important facts, but gives also gives small details. The tiger was introduced before part two of the novel, abandoning the traditional viewpoint of him as the antagonist. Instead, I felt as if they were more of a team, battling against the forces of nature and occasionally getting into fights. The theme of this novel is that we as humans need stories to survive this life. This is pointed out by the fact that he practices three religions, each with their own unique stories. The twist ending underlines this leaving no doubt about it. Still it took me a while to figure out the message completely.<br />This book will make you believe in God, some reviewers praised. Life of Pi is a highly religious novel, but it also is enjoyable from a secular perspective, too. This book is enjoyable if you do not need action at every point of the novel, and also like a similar setting throughout the majority of the novel.

B0050DIWHU|2.0|As a regular Linkedin user and reader of Hastings's short-form writing, I was looking forward to getting some practical advice about how to increase my visibility in the marketplace and solidify my career position. While the book starts out well with some practical advice (mostly about how to use Linkedin, which seems self-serving), it eventually devolves into rah-rah cheerleading and the recounting of success stories an average person couldn't hope to re-create. Yes, Jeff Bezos is a big success because of his tenacity. But how does that relate to my career? The advice is also frequently contradictory. A chapter on tenacity closely follows a chapter on being able to \\"pivot\\" on a moment's notice and change one's career path. In the end the book was useful as a motivator to help me start doing *something* to increase my visibility in the marketplace, but not helpful with what or how to do it.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|Well, I have only used the SD card adapter.  It worked really well at transferring the pictures/videos.  It would be nice if I can view the photo directly from the SD instead of having to import them first.  That's really a software issue.  I am still new, so maybe I'll figure it out in the future.  I plan to use these for traveling, so I don't really have the need to use them at home with a computer available.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was actually a pretty good book. The idea may not be orignal (remember the movie 50 First Dates?), which made me a little skeptical, but it was interesting. The story captures your attention, and holds it until the end. The ending was definitely a surprise, as I thought I had it all figured out! S.J. Watson has a creative writing style and paints clear pictures in the mind of the reader.

B007PKOKTK|2.0|Yes, there are fun moments, but that's all they are - moments. Between the moments the screen play is slow and plodding. A few times the action actually builds, but instead of making it to the top of a mountain of excitement you realize you're floating ever so slowly down into a pastel colored swirl of bordom with a...ah..zzzz. Grade A animation with a grade B plot and screen play. Somebody tazer me to get my heart beating again please.

B0009PAVI2|3.0|Edit: After some extended use, I've had to drop my review to 3 stars. Don't get me wrong, this is still a great product, but I DO NOT recommend it for low profile filters. It has scratched several of my lower profile Hoya filters. Standard depth filters will be fine but low profile filters will be toast unless you wrap them in microfiber cleaning cloths before inserting them...<br /><br />I purchased this case based on the following needs:<br /><br />-quick and easy access to filters<br />-holds only the filters I need for the lenses I'm carrying when hiking or out-and-about<br />-secure external attachment to my sling for fast swapping<br /><br />All my needs were met perfectly.<br /><br />This filter case is very durable, and has a build quality that will surely last for years to come. The velcro is very secure--the back velcro strap has an added snap button for that extra bit of security and the front velcro is just as secure with the added benefit of a plastic snap--your filters aren't going anywhere. It has stayed attached to my bag or belt on long hikes through bushes and bumps with no problems. I don't need to check to make sure things are still attached.<br /><br />The padding is good enough to keep my filters from damaging each other (varying sizes) and the height of the pockets is perfect for easy access without having to dig for them.<br /><br />What else can I say? If this case design is what you're looking for, then the product will make you happy. Quality all the way.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is like an awesome version of the Smurf's Game. (Except that its Ice Age. The Ice Age movies are one of my favorite movie series!)  :D
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Baldacci's latest book grabs you at the beginning - Will Robie is a government assassin.  He does his job efficiently and lives his solitary life.  His targets are as diverse as a Mexican drug lord and a Saudi prince.<br /><br />But Robie is tasked to a target close to home - a mother with two young sons.  When he finds he can't pull the trigger his world unravels.  As he runs he comes across a fourteen year old girl that is in imminent danger.  He goes on the run with the girl, clueless as to who is chasing her, knowing those chasing him are lethal.<br /><br />The book bogs down through the middle and the end wraps up a little too conveniently.  More than a few too many implausible situations and you would have to be a novice mystery reader to miss the villian.<br /><br />Just okay.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I expected this game to be awesome and trust me it is. By far one of the best versions. My issue is paying 2.99 for a game which is the most expensive on all platforms and not getting the extra world that comes with it &quot; Danger Zone&quot;. The ipod/iphone/ipad all have in their paid and free versions. And several of my friends have it on their android phones. Yet we who pay 2.99 get the least for the most money. It makes me angry and I hope the updates for the Kindle Fire come out soon.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cute and simple.  it clearly tells you what to do next.  so far no brain power is needed.  I'm hoping for it to become a little more challenging.  also has cute mini games.  worthwhile, and the price is right. . . Free!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is reallly the only app I use now. I played this game as kid on the computer forever ago and it's. just as fun noe being an adult. It's super addicting, there's tons of stuff to do,  buy and it will give you something to do for hours. The only dislike I have is how fast your energy runs out.

0316113506|3.0|\\"Mens sana in corpore sano\\". Exercise is good for your body and for your mind. The book is a clear attempt to convince and motivate the reader to pursue a healthier life. The message is important and, as far as I know, true. Scientific research is starting to investigate the exercise-brain link and the biochemical mechanics that make it possible. So far so good.<br /><br />The book follows a fairly simple patter: present some \\"story\\" (school kids, patients, athletes, ...), show how the exercise helped improve some relevant cognitive metrics, discuss the relevant scientific literature, and explain the underlying mechanisms (brain structures, biochemical \\"actors\\", ...). Repeat the pattern for a list of medical conditions (depression, ADHD, ...).<br /><br />This structure gets repetitive very quickly. The same concepts are repeated over and over. The \\"stories\\" are not always very engaging (nothing compared the ones presented by Oliver Sacks, for example), the underlying biochemical structure is fairly complex and doesn't seem to add much to the \\"message\\" (it's a fascinating topic in itself, and I suppose it's nearly impossible to explain such a complex machine in a book for the general public, but I found it quite dry and, at times, confusing).<br /><br />There's no bibliography in case you want to look up some specific examples in more details.<br /><br />There are very few details on what kind of activities are the \\"best\\" (not enough scientific data yet), even if the last chapter tries to be more specific. There's almost no \\"development\\" in the story, no doubts, no opposite sides and compromises the be reached. The message is crystal clear from the first page to the last. There are no \\"ah!\\" moments, when things really come together and offer a new perspective that adds depth to the message.<br /><br />The book is probably more interesting if you have been diagnosed with one of the pathologies he describes ...<br /><br />I guess all I wanted to know could have been condensed in 10 pages, and I'll be looking forward to a better version with more \\"data\\" in 10 years.
B007TR1R1I|2.0|Set in the 1950s, The Deep Blue Sea is the story of Hester Collyer (Rachel Weisz). When you're first introduced to her, she's seen recovering from a suicide attempt and it's slowly revealed that she's torn between two lovers. She was originally married to the wealthy High Court judge Sir William Collyer (Simon Russell Beale), but was cheating on him with the careless former Royal Air Force pilot Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston). Hess had a mutual affection for Collyer, but fell into deep, passionate love with Freddie. Now on a path that will lead her to her own self destruction, Hess now finds herself at a crossroads that even she has difficulty deciding which direction to travel down next.<br /><br />The frustrating thing about The Deep Blue Sea is that it takes about thirty to forty minutes to fully grasp the story the film is trying to tell. The romantic drama is mostly told through a series of flashbacks, but it's frequently difficult to distinguish what happened in the past and what's currently happening in the present. As the film progresses and Hess is shown with Collyer right after just having an argument with Freddie, things become a bit easier to process. Earlier on though, especially when Hess is first getting up and around after her suicide attempt is when you feel kind of lost.<br /><br />Part of me thought the entire film was going to be Rachel Weisz standing in front of a curtained window smoking the entire time and in a way it kind of was. There was suicide, cheating, and a really stuffy and uptight woman (Collyer's mom played by Barbara Jefford) that you wanted to slap for being so obnoxious, but the entire point seemed lost. It all doesn't really click until Collyer walks in on Hess' phone call with Freddie, the car ride Hess and Collyer share immediately after, and the scene where Freddie finds the letter in Hess' pocket.<br /><br />Even though the film itself didn't exactly sit well with me, the performances didn't make up for the film's shortcomings but were easily the most enjoyable aspect. The three individuals involved in the love triangle are downright exceptional at times. They're all capable of telling the story of the film with that look of despair in their eyes; that one that looks like they're about to burst into tears but the men never do.<br /><br />The relationship between Hess and Collyer reminded me of a former relationship my mom had where someone was so deeply in love with her, but she just didn't feel the same way about him. She had a fondness for him and cared about him, but didn't love him in that way. Simon Russell Beale does a really fantastic job portraying a man just trying to wrap his head around that. Freddie is a man who enjoys drinking too much, is a bit too proud of his accomplishments as a pilot, and a jokester with an immature sense of humor. He's very passionate about everything that he does and Tom Hiddleston does a great job bringing all of that out on-screen. His outbursts were some of the highlights of the film.<br /><br />The real treasure in the film though is Rachel Weisz. I can honestly say that I've never seen a better performance from her. She wants to make it work with Freddie so bad, but at the same time doesn't enjoy being the cause of Collyer's anger and sorrow. Weisz's facial expressions give life to the emotional game of tug of war she's putting herself though more than simple words ever actually could. It all masterfully comes together in the final scene of the film where Weisz finally breaks down and the amount of despair that she feels drops down on your chest like a 35-pound cinder block.<br /><br />It seemed like every sound effect used in the film was being done into a tin can. Spoken dialogue sounded fine, but every sound had this echo effect to it. Doors being shut were the biggest offenders, but the scene at Collyer's mother's house where they're eating supper was littered with the noises of utensils being used that seemed too loud or there was too muchof an emphasis on them or something.<br /><br />The Deep Blue Sea was not meshing well with my cinematical tastes and opinions when it first began. Its disjointed technique of storytelling took some getting used to. However once things got going the film reminded me of my life back in 2007 as I watched my mom go through something similar. While it was honestly one of the worst times of either of our lives, it made it easier to connect to the characters in the film and understand what they were going through. Rachel Weisz has never been better as The Deep Blue Sea is her best performance to date. At the end of the day, The Deep Blue Sea is worth giving a chance based on Weisz's performance alone.of an emphasis on them or something.<br /><br />The Deep Blue Sea was not meshing well with my cinematical tastes and opinions when it first began.

B0068TL23G|1.0|while this is an amazing game and I have had a lot of fun with it, whats with the strange permissions!? The design seeing dollar signs? I will not be upgrading this app and will most likely uninstall it.
B0077POH8M|2.0|On paper this CPU cooler looks great.  And indeed it really works well.  No quibble.  Problem is whoever designed its mounting should be invited to find a job with some brand X.  This cooler can only be successfully installed on a motherbd PRIOR to mounting in the case.  Even if you have plenty of access to the rear.<br /><br />It has to be installed with the motherbd horizontal, otherwise it simply falls off the CPU while you fuss with the mounting screws, in a foul mood.  There are 3 mounting holes (775, 1155, 1366) on each foot -- innovative idea?  Check your curse vocabulary because you will need it when the mounting screw slips from one hole to its neighbor.  And on one foot then another.  Then be careful not to overtighten the screws or your might short something.  If you forgot to install the ram sticks, tough luck.  Accessing the closest stick once the cooler is installed likely requires removing the cooler.  And then when it is in the case.  That may be the time to replace it with something designed by someone who actually mounted one.<br /><br />Too bad.  Zalman makes excellent products.  Except for this one.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and easy but best of all no waiting around!  I am really am loving it!<br />I don't enjoy the constant directions I like to figure thing s out on my own.  but otherwise it is really great!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book, just finished book 2. Can't wait to read book 3. Can't help but fall in love with Ana and Christian!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like this case because it doesn't add bulk to the device.  All ports are available.  Installation was a breeze.  I haven't used the stand feature much, but it does work as designed.<br /><br />I took a case I purchased back to the store after watching the video of the installation of this case.  In the video, I could see that it did not add a lot of bulk to the Fire and the installation was a snap to perform.<br /><br />I would recommend this case.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It keeps me busy during my down time. I'm. loving the animals that are walking around the little village. All I. wanna know is when can I. use them?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just added this game on my Kindle Fire and iphone. Had it previously on my andoid phone and glad to get it on my two new devices. Love this version of Solitaire. A really good choice.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are short and fun. some games could be longer or have a free play mode. controls could use some improvement.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the apps not horrible. There are some games that are dumb yet addicting. at times it stinks you need so many points to open up a new game.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Game is super fun until it messes up at level 34 or so. Also it would be significantly improved by a reduction in the 3 minute energy wait.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I loved this game. Lots of things to do. I especially liked the hints feature. For me nothing is.more frustrating than purchasers a game and having to abandon it. because it has no hints and I am stuck. Please Alawar Games bring me more.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Dr. Temple Grandin is an amazing person.  To have overcome her personal differences and achieve the status of Phd is just incredible.  I have had the pleasure os seeing her in person and hearing her lecture.  Clare Danes did the most outstanding job in capturing the real Temple Grandin in this movie.
030788743X|5.0|Are you a child of the eighties? Do you know exactly what I'm talking about when I mention things like Family Ties, Short Circuit and Pacman sit down arcade cabinets? Do you enjoy lighthearted adventure tales that wield edge-of-your-seat-excitement like a Jedi with a lightsaber? Then maybe you'll enjoy Ready Player One half as much as I did. With a delicious cast of characters that you instantly connect to, and a rich and enchanting online universe where practically anything is possible, I was, without exaggeration, hooked from page one.<br />I have three complaints about this book.<br />1. I wish it were at least twice as long so I could have devoted more of my life to escaping within its pages.<br />2. I wished this was the first of a series of books that let me return to see these unique characters explore even more of the OASIS.<br />3. For the life of me, I can't find another book that can follow this. The world needs more action/comedy/sci-fi/scavenger hunt/80s pop culture filled/gamer stories. If anyone has any recommendations, I'd love to hear em.
1439192812|5.0|I have known and admired Richard Dawkins' many contributions from the time we were young ethologists together, through his pioneering work on evolutionary thought, into his often strident (but well taken) pleas for human rationality.  Never did I suspect Richard would produce a science overview volume (beautifully illustrated by Dave McKean) that children and parents will delight having in their homes.  The bedside table is a perfect location.  Seniors who have even a passing interest in nature will love it too.  Richard has produced an easy to understand delight that is \\"spot on\\" from every angle.<br /><br />Put into simple words this is BY FAR the most beautifully produced and informative science overview book I have ever seen.  It is truly a book for all ages in which the magic of reality in our natural world is presented with an intellect, grace and style that Richard is appropriately admired for.  I am frankly surprised, delighted and amazed how he has taken his vast knowledge and writing talents to create a remarkable volume that all readers can delight in.  Its a gem that sparkles brightly with every page.  Yes, nature is magic in the deep sense of the term.  I could not recommend this beautiful volume more highly.  Buy it whatever your age.  This book is a treasure.  You will love it.<br /><br />John C. Fentress<br />Eugene, Oregon
B006R1T40I|5.0|Been awhile since Bonnie released a new album. Slipstream doesn't disappoint.<br />I like this one... a lot. Vocals, backup, rhythm and that slide-guitar.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|Both Zach Gilifinakis & Kier Gilchrist put on amazing performances in this film. A great dark comedy on what it's like to find yourself and the struggles along the way.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good game, can't wait for the next edition! It is challenging and fun. It is pretty addictive, hard to put down!
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game, love to sit there and really makes you think about how to finish each puzzle and even whether or not you can better their solution
B004SBX112|4.0|I love seasons. It's much more challenging than the original and the levels are vibrant. Highly recommended. Just wish levels were released faster.
B001KAPYYQ|5.0|I have been to London more than 20 times starting in the mid-1980's.  I first read this book as a paperback around 1998.  The fictional characters involved in historical events helped put many places, events, and people in London's history into perspective.  My British friend's are often astounded by the historical tidbits that I subconsciously retrieve from this book (e.g., the historical origen for using the term \\"bride\\" to describe the female wedding partner).  My most recent purchase was driven by the need to have a hardcopy version of this book in my library.
0312641893|5.0|So I've just finished Cinder and I'm left thinking \\"but...where's the rest?\\" Don't get me wrong, it had a nice ending, but I want MORE. And I'm a little confused as to whether we'll ever get to read more about Cinder and Kai or if that's the end of the road for them.<br /><br />Going into it, I kind of figured I'd love it since 1) I really like scifi and 2)everyone's been raving about it for ages. I kind of wish I'd had less expectations, but not because it tainted my love for Cinder or anything, just because I really wish my love for it could have been more of a surprise. Awesome books are pretty much the best surprises ever.<br /><br />Okay, let's talk about the actual book now. It is for reals amazing. The characters all have full personalities whether I they're likable or not and the world is incredibly detailed. I never even found myself wanting for more backstory or anything of the sort.<br /><br />I'd heard some people saying they couldn't really see the Cinderella parallels, but they seemed pretty obvious to me. That's not a complaint, though. I really loved the way the fairytale was integrated into the new story. Cinder didn't feel any lesser because it was based off of a fairytale. Cinder was able to stand on its own two feet (or one regular and one cyborg foot) as a story and it does an absolutely fantastic job of being a fairytale spinoff. I know it's hard to believe that scifi Cinderella works, but it definitely does.<br /><br />The Nutshell: I know this is a terrible review and I'll never be able to do Cinder justice, but believe me when I say that it's a book worth your time. If you like scifi, fairytale spinnoffs, and strong lead firls this is definitely the book for you. I advise not waiting around any longer to read this one :]
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. I downloaded it to use on my kindle fire. I like the different options...easy to change settings.  highly recommend!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|was cute at first&hellip; then my houses reset to 365 days till I could collect money again. uninstall right away.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|Its a good game. Makes a nice time passer. It its similar to the game concentration only more fast paced.
B007IK44CK|1.0|I found the storyline jumbled, the dialog disconnected and many of the scenes not of nature in the movie seemed very staged.<br /><br />Tom has seen far better days with the likes of Jerry Maguire, Risky Business and Top Gun...  This IMF/Mission Impossible franchise needs to go the way of the goonie bird and dinosaurs, it has lived past its shelf life.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|Fantastic just as you would expect, I busted it out just before a road trip and was speeding before I knew it. Promptly I set the cruise control and enjoyed it safely.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Samurai. vs Zombies is by far one of the most charming games out there by far. The graphics are splendid and the gameplay is simple and addictive. With a free pricetag you just simply cant go wrong with this game.
0385342047|3.0|If you like the other Shopaholic books, you will probably like this one too, although it won't blow you away. One of the more frustrating aspects of this series is that Bex doesn't really ever seem to grow or develop; she is the same person in every book. Realistic? Maybe. But she is still her over the top self in this one, just now with a little girl, a shopaholic in training. Same patterns with the characters, Luke is career-driven and secretive, Becky spends too much and gets into scrapes, but now they're continuing the cycle with their daughter.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun except for having to buy points after a certain time in order to complete the challenges.
B006XIR9KM|3.0|I went to happily download this app & then find it needs full permissions to run. I understand about wanting internet access, but someone please explain to me why a game needs access to my phone IDs, to edit my drive & all the rest? Since I cannot turn these permissions off, I cancelled the download.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Great contemporary songs to listen to. They were the opening band for an Elton John concert. I am considering buying the Metallica version that is advertised on Amazon.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, there was a lot of sex though! Don't get me wrong I like some sex scenes but it got to be a little much at times and a little repetitive. This series has been compared to the twilight books a lot and there are some similarities. I like these books more though because it's more \\"grown up\\" and I can relate to their relationship more, they deal with real life problems. I'm excited to see how the movie turns out.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|This new album from The Mars Volta took a litte getting used to for me at first. Being a long time fan of theirs, I expect them to change and evolve with each new output, so that wasn't what was holding me back. But after about 5 or 6 times through the album it just started to \\"click\\" and now I love this disk (yes I still buy them in CD format) and new sound. My current favorite track is In Absentia. The rest are all good too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read through all three books really fast, love all of them. This one was really intense and the ending was sad. A lot of people didn't like the ending and although it wasn't the fairytale ending it was the most practical. I would have been happier with not so many people dieing, but it was still good. Not everything ends with rainbows and ponies and this book shows that!
B0036G94DY|4.0|Doing the job as expected: it's small, moves air, and is relatively quiet.  Now, I'm hoping for (and expecting) reliability.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|There wasn't as much sex as the first book which I liked. Also you learn more about what happened to Christian Grey when he was a boy. It was a good second book and the ending leaves you HAVING to get the third book right away. I found myself getting really pissed at Ana sometimes I feel like she's just straight dumb and really immature at times. Besides that I really liked it. If you didn't like the first book don't read this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome app. have not had any problems once I figured out how it worked.Lol. I love it scrat is my fav.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book wasn't as good as the first but was still really good. I didn't know where it was going to go and the last couple pages are the best. You don't expect it at all. I was expecting there to be more love triangle stuff between Gale, Katniss, and Peeta but there wasn't and I was happy with that. Don't need another twilight on our hands!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|brings back memories of mario.fun for all ages even my 6yr old loves to play.its addictive tho so be careful lol
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked immediately! Flew through the book and the entire time was thinking how is this going to work out? I was surprised to find out that younger kids were reading this book because there is a lot of killing and it just seems a little too much for children. The movie isn't as good as the book and without the book I would have been lost. So read it before you see it!
B0072GPPNC|5.0|This is simply a beautiful movie.  The filming is spectacular, the horse is amazing, and the story is well put together to keep you entertained from beginning to end.  If you love horses, or have horses in your life, you won't move from your chair until the movie is over.  It's just a beautiful, captivating, enjoyable film.  Even the duck is wonderful!
B0063IH60K|3.0|First of all I would like to say I really like this app but I have a couple issues with it at the moment. I play this game on my Droid Incredible 2 and my Kindle Fire and I have noticed a difference in how it plays on each device. The game plays smoothly on my phone with no lag but when I play it on the Fire it tends to lag somewhat when cards are moving across the screen. The other issue I have is with the video ads. In my opinion they are intrusive. I haven't had any issues with random video ads popping up when the game isnt being played. However, I have figured out how to stop them on my Fire. I terminate the wifi connection when I play the game and turn it back on when I need it.<br /><br />Bottom line... if the game played as smoothly on my Fire as it does on my phone and there were no video ads this app would get five stars for being a great solitare game. As it stands now it only gets three from me.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game my kids. play this all day there friends ask if they can play I work at a school and I let kids play and they iti give this game five star.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I got this for my husband who is in his twenties but loves to build things and doesnt have much of any hobbies.  He loves it and its keeping him busy, im loving the peace and quiet! :-)

0345803485|1.0|I can't believe all the wonderful reviews this book is getting. I normally don't take the time to write bad reviews but since this book is getting so much media attention, I can't resist. This has to be one of the cheesiest, poorly written books I have come across in a long time. I'm actually ashamed to say that I read it. The plot is just stupid and the characters are so unlikeable. The only excuse for the great reviews is the huge number of bored, sexually deprived housewives in this world.Don't waste your money.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its just like the paid version except its not ad free and it dosen't have the &quot;mighty eagle&quot;. Except for that its great.
B006CS7UXO|5.0|After nearly 25 years of releasing singles and cds, the PET SHOP BOYS are proving once again that they are only getting better as time passes. Listening to FORMAT, I am struck by the number of excellent songs that are as good if not better to some of the tracks that they have released as singles. For example the duet with Elton John \\"In Private\\" works really well as an upbeat pop number and \\"Blue on Blue\\" is classic Euro Hi-NRG.<br /><br />Another hidden gem is \\"We're the Pet Shop Boys\\" which is their cover of a song first released by My Robot Friend and then most recently by Robbie Williams. What group do you know of, has done a cover of a song that pokes fun or is about themselves done by someone else? You will love this song with all the references to PSB classic hits...<br /><br />Do not be distracted by the fact that some of these tracks were originally made several years back. For example, \\"The Boy Who Couldn't Keep His Clothes On\\" (produced in 1997) could have been played at this year's WORLD MUSIC CONFERENCE in Miami and would have received great praise. It helps of course, that it was produced by Danny Tenaglia and has a great 4/4 House beat.<br /><br />Die hard fans like myself might not enjoy every single song but with a choice of 38 tracks, there is tons of material to savour.<br /><br />For me, cd 2 is much stronger. Overall, here you get all the songs that previously were only available as expensive import only cd or dvd or in the case of \\"We're all criminals now\\" digital download (Hence the title of the cd - FORMAT) only for the cost of a regular double cd. Well worth it!<br /><br />I only wished other bands put out such b-side or alternative compilations. But then, how many artists have the creativity, genius and longetivity of the Pet Shop Boys!
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I love the app. I used to write my passwords down so I wouldn't forget even though you shouldn't, because I am so forgetful. Then, when I had to change passwords it was a sloppy mess of scratching through or using a new post-it. Now, storing passwords is easy.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saved a ton of money by buying this as an eBook for my lovely kindle. I breezed through it (like so many others have) in about a day. I'll admit, I wasn't too keen on reading it at first, as I am curmudgeonly and usually avoid anything too popular out of spite, but my sisters (both in their early twenties, for the record) insisted that I give it a try. I'm so glad I did!    This isn't a perfect novel, not by far, but it is just compelling enough to keep you going, just human enough to make you really care, and yes, just violent enough to entertain in the way that only such things can. I don't think the violence was too much, nor do I think it was gratuitous--at least for this first installment in the series. Be warned: there is enough of a cliff-hanger of an ending that you will really have to read the next two books.    \\"The Hunger Games\\" is very dark, thematically, but then it would be, wouldn't it? For the parents out there wondering if this book *promotes* child-on-child violence, I have to say: emphatically not. \\"Harry Potter\\" does that more than this book does, because unlike Harry, Katniss never sets out to deliberately humiliate anyone (but I digress! I loved the Harry Potter books, but for those of you looking for a benchmark, I do think HP is much softer on bullying behaviour than the Hunger Games books). Katniss is a fine heroine--a believable teenage girl, but not a stereotype.    So why not five stars? Well, while the story and characters were compelling enough to keep me going, the writing was a little lackluster at times and even though I liked Katniss, it could get a little frustrating being \\"stuck in her head,\\" as the entire novel is written in first person present. Additionally, just because Katniss doesn't want to know to much about the other children in the story (for good reason, if you know anything about the basic plot), as I reader I would have liked to know a bit more!  Plus I really do think this book should have resolved in a way that left a better option for treating it as a stand-along novel. I know it's a trilogy, but as it is sold separately I would have preferred that it have enough of a resolution to be its own entity. Other opinions may differ.    If you would like to know more of my thoughts on the series as a whole (with spoilers, though!), I've been writing a series of blog posts on the books at [...]
B007BRJYF2|5.0|Excellent hidden object game, photo realistic grafx, story told through actual characters, full screen display and zero glitches. Avg gametime may be 3-6 hours. Ive been at it for 4 or so and not finished yet. Absolutely worth it at a buck or two.
0345803485|5.0|I am usually don't read, I do not really enjoy it. But when I heard about this. I had to check it out. WOW!

Even if your not into this type of story check it out, you just might surprise yourself.

B006XIR9KM|5.0|Just played for a few minutes and loved it. One of the very few games I will play over and over.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing trilogy very creative and wonderful. The combination of our past history and what can become of our future makes this series one of my favorites for sure not to mention the hopeless romantic \\"love story\\". I would most definitely recommend the books, unfortunately I was not a big fan of the first movie.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moATWX86IJBMWD]]I spent over a half hour trying to install this properly.  If I had to install it again, I could do it in 5 minutes, but the instructions were useless, consisted of \\"Install backing, tighten cooler to motherboard.\\"  - not very helpful, and the design has a few problems.  While installing, I mounted the back bracket, took me about 5 minutes to figure out exactly what pieces were supposed to go where, but once I figured out how it was supposed to go I got the nuts onto the mounting screws.  Next to screw the cooler into the mounting screws from the top, fairly simple, except as I was screwing the second screw down I realized I had twisted the cooler a bit to the side.  No problem, just back the screws out and adjust.  Wrong.  The screws are much stronger than the nuts, so I ended up just unscrewing the nuts from the bottom, now the mounting screws are stuck on the cooler screws, I can't get them off, and because of the spring design its almost impossible to push mounting screw (since its now attached to the cooler bracket) through the hole to get the nut back on.  I realize its partially my fault for not doing enough reading before installing this, but it might as well have not come with any instructions.<br /><br />After finally getting it installed (using only 3 of the mounting screws), I am fairly pleased with it.  It is very large, and while heavy it doesn't feel like it's going to break the motherboard at all.  I am using it in a fairly small mATX tower, and it just barely fits.  I had to remove the side intake fan, I also removed the 120mm rear exhaust fan so that it doesnt conflict with the 120mm fan that is mounted on the cooler.  I am using it on a Gigabyte Z68MA mATX motherboard and a intel i5 2500k processor.  This is the first time I have overclocked it, and I am currently running at 4.5GHz (stock is 3.3GHz), it is idling at 32 Celsius and full load is 60 Celsius (numbers differ from video, due to different room temps (85 F in video vs 65 F when I wrote this), this is about what the stock fan/non OC'd temps were at, so this fan is great for overclockers.  It was idling at about 27 celsius at stock clock settings.<br /><br />With all of the fans removed on my case, I was worried about heat, especially since I also installed an Asus EA HD6850 video card and the case is very small.  So far I have had no problem with heat at all, and the CPU is staying at acceptable temperatures no matter what I'm doing.  It is also very quiet, when I walk into the room I sometimes have trouble telling if the computer is on.eo vs 65 F when I wrote this), this is about what the stock fan/non OC'd temps were at, so this fan is great for overclockers.

B0042816YK|5.0|I watched the movie and was so intrigued by it, I went and bought the book. A lot of people will not appreciate Elizabeth's experiences and the way she learned how to live her best life, because they are too myopic. I have learned how to appreciate my life because it is somewhat similar to the setting of her journey. I especially learned how to forgive people & let go of bad tastes. It's just a book & a movie but I connected very deeply  with it in a good way.
0345803485|1.0|One of my co-workers suggested we start an office bookclub.  I read like crazy, so of course I was in.  She had heard about \\"Fifty Shades\\" and thought this would be a good start.  Ummm. No.  Other than ripping the book to shreads, I can't even fathom what eight women are going to talk about!  This was a case of Pretty Woman, meets, Twilight, meets, 9 1/2 Weeks - except for the fact that I was actually entertained by those.  OH, and James would have to use MY name for the twisted Mrs. Robinson. So, am I buying books two and three?? Nope. Time to go find something GOOD to read.
0553582038|4.0|I agree that this book was Slower then the rest, however that doesn't mean that it wasn't just as important to the overall story. I get it. I've read the reviews and I almost didn't read this one after some of what I read, but so far I can't say that I was Disappointed. I believe that there is a method to the madness that we all soon will understand in books to come! I love the story enough to read them all and I have Faith in our author that he will not disappoint his readers! Like I said it was a bit slower but well worth the read IMO!
B0052GACNM|5.0|What a great CD of beautiful music.  Saw this on public television and just had to add it to my CD collection.  It's a wonderful combination of beautiful voices and different singing styles.  Tony still has it!
055357342X|5.0|This book by far is My favorite of the series.<br />Mr. Martin, You sir, are a genius. I have never read a book series or single book alive with more colorful descriptions or character portrayals as these. The books have sucked me into the realm of Westeros. I find myself holding my breath in many places and I can not WAIT to read the rest. My words will not do the series justice so you will have to read the story for yourself, but I promise you will NOT be disappointed!

Does anyone recall the gift to all of us when \\"Songs From The Wood\\" was released!  Whenever an artist of this caliber is gracious enough to write something of this magnitude - it is GIFT to the world.  Appreciate it - don't compare it.  This is not a question of best or better - it is a question of enjoyment.  I cannot believe the folks who say they are fans - but complain that this is not TAAB.  Nothing is TAAB  - that was a gift to us when Ian and the band put it together.  This is another gift.  As for me, I have listened to it 10x and I am still finding new themes to enjoy.  I have seen Tull and Ian over 2 dozen times over the years.  He is always an entertainer first and foremost.  Just as the world was fortunate to have Bach, Brahms, Bethoven - the world is lucky to HAVE and ENJOY Ian Anderson. All of this music will outlive us and every bit is a good as classic.  How may more pieces will we get from Ian...I certainly hope there will be more.  I already have my tickets for TAAB and TAAB2 - a GOTTA see - look for me in the first row - THANKS IAN!!!

B005LAJ22Q|4.0|Ok, I don't like zombies! I have never watched a single zombie movie all the way through, but this caught me up. Really I find myself watching it for the actual characters. Every part of this is done well from writing, directing and even effects. We don't get AMC so DVD is my only fix. We also really like the extra features which catch us up on where this came from and how some things are done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app!  The selection of various versions of the Bible is very beneficial during my study time.  Athens reading plans especially for youth has been a tremendous blessing to my son.  This app offers so much more than some of the others I have tried.  You absolutely will Not be dissappointed!
0439023513|5.0|I read this book in two days. It is a great book. I am an adult and was hooked on the series immediately. I bought it for my sisters birthday. Great price for a hardback book. I do not think this series is appropriate for grades under 5th.
B007BZM30M|4.0|I'm not saying this is a classic or anything because it probably won't go down as one. But as far as catchy, foot-tappin' pop songs go, this one is one of the best out right now. Forget my girl Katy Perry's \\"Part Of Me\\" or the latest of Nicki Minaj--we now have Carly Rae Jepsen churning out this feel good pop ditty.<br /><br />And catchy isn't even the half. The lyrics seem as if they could be picked up in just a few listens as I was humming some of the song on the first run through. The violin work is very infectious, the video, cutesy and the ending, hilarious.<br /><br />Not to be missed.<br /><br />4 stars.
0439023491|5.0|This is an excellent book for an excellent price. It is a hardback book. The book is wonderful! Read it in 3 days (and I have a full time job).

B004EPZ070|4.0|I have read all the Emily Giffin books, so naturally when the movie came out I had to see it. I saw it in theaters and loved it. When it came out I purchased it. Funny and cute.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather app I have found to date.  It allows me the ability to get accurate weather for multiple locations with satellite and  multi-day forecasts available for each.  I highly recommend it!
1442346272|5.0|I have never been a huge Apple fan, maybe because I did not understand their conceptual marketing strategy.  I do now, and i am impressed at what they have been able to accomplish.<br /><br />I must say that I had a hard time stopping any of the 20 audio cd's.  This was one of the top two or three audio books that i ever listened to.  I will listen to it again.  Very interesting story done by a top notch author, Walter Isaacson.<br /><br />Thanks for the great Book!!!!
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|this cd dvd is great for classic hardrock lovers this guys are here to save us from that radio nonsense  thats on today my favorites are  the one, black country madusa to name a few this cd should be in any hard rock fan collection

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This ifs probably the best book to screen that I have ever seen. Fans of the book series will find themselves face to face with their favorite characyers. It is also an incredible introduction to the dramas, deceptions, passions and intrigues of this incredible series. Do yourself a favor, buy this and then clear your evenings for a week!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is very well designed and has many versions available.  I love all the reading plans and how simple it is to navigate.  You do not have to go back to a table of contents to move around!  Great to looking up a series of references.<br /><br />The feature that just takes me over the top is the audible feature.  I love having Scripture read to me as I relax before falling asleep.  The reader's voices are much nicer than the automated text to speech version.<br /><br />I have not yet even scratched the surface of all that this app offers yet I love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a great read, I read the whole triology in 2.5 days!!!!  The characters are so interesting and it's a sexy and fun read!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game works smoothly and is excellent when you want a quick break or have a few minutes to 'waste'.  Sometimes the tough part is not succumbing to 'just one more game'.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Purchased this DVD for my nephew, who's five years old, and he loves it. It's now his favorite Christmas video. In a world full of CGI and video games, it's nice to still have classics like this to pass along.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book off amazon and abandoned my husband and children for a whole day reading it. I could not put it down. I found myself laughing and smiling during certain parts and falling in love with these characters. I do not think it is anything like Twilight. Which by the way I have read all those books too. I will be re-reading this book and the whole series for many years to come, its that good.
B000002JSN|5.0|Here it is, ladies and gentlemen: the ultimate Led Zeppelin album.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin II (1969) may have been more influential and Led Zeppelin IV (1971) may be more iconic but Physical Graffiti (1975) captures Led Zeppelin at its peak: ambitious, sprawling, very hedonistic yet very irresistible and pleasurable to listen to, rather out of emotional release or musical adventure. Ending one of the greatest winning streaks in rock n' roll history (only Bob Dylan's 1963-1970 streak, the Stones' Beggars Banquet-to-Exile era and Pink Floyd's mammoth 70's period from Meddle to The Wall competes), Physical Graffiti was the last true masterpiece from the mighty Zep before idiotic disco acts and grotesquely overvalued punk rock bands came around and changed the music landscape forever.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the fact that this is a double-album. Most double/triple vinyl LPs have truckloads of filler (Sandinista, anybody?); not Physical Graffiti. The first disc, which is mostly composed of the newer, more recent tracks, would have been an outstanding single CD in its own right. The second disc, featuring experiments, oddities and leftovers from previous albums, fascinates because of its sprawl as this disc could have easily been passed off as an excellent B-side compilation. Taken together, however, Graffiti is a force to be reckoned with. No matter how many times once listens to it, it never grows tiring; even the longest songs (\\"In My Time of Dying\\", \\"Kashmir\\" and \\"In the Light\\") absorb rather than bore.<br /><br />The first side of disc one starts off with the pounding \\"Custard Pie\\", complete with Jimmy Page's funky Stones-like riffs, John Paul Jones' subdue yet catchy electric clavinet and Robert Plant spouting out lyrics of sexual innuendos. \\"The Rover\\", one of the two 1972 songs on disc one (the other being \\"Houses of the Holy\\"), is an excellent rocker where Bonzo's pounding drums lure one in before Page and Jones come in to add the flavor. The first side concludes with the blues-flavored epic \\"In My Time of Dying\\", where Page performs an intoxicating slide guitar and the band goes into an engaging jam that recalls the Allman Brothers Band.<br /><br />Disc one's second disc opens with an uncharacteristically pop-oriented rocker from Zeppelin: \\"Houses of the Holy\\". As one could tell by the song's title, \\"Houses\\" was recorded during the making of the album with the same name (1973). \\"Trampled Under Foot\\", probably the band's greatest stab at funk, follows. Zeppelin had already experimented with funk in Houses of the Holy but those songs (especially \\"The Crunge\\") were considerably light-hearted fare. \\"Trampled\\" is the real deal, with Page's enticing Eddie Hazel-like guitar riffs, Jones' tuneful synthesizers and Bonzo's percussion providing the groove instead of the typical bluster.<br /><br />Then there's \\"Kashmir\\".<br /><br />With all due respect to anyone who perceives \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" as the ultimate Led Zeppelin song, if there was one that was such, it would be \\"Kashmir\\". A gargantuan Middle Eastern-influenced set piece complete with orchestral brass, startling mellotron and Robert Plant's harrowing singing about the deserts, \\"Kashmir\\" remains one of Zeppelin's most popular and artistically successful achievements, deservedly playing on classic rock radios constantly. To anyone who dares to associate Led Zeppelin with heavy metal, give this a track a listen and you'll realize that being heavy doesn't involve banging heads.<br /><br />The second disc, as stated earlier, is composed of many experimental tracks and leftovers from years before. For example, \\"Bron Yr-Aur\\" is an acoustic number straight out of the Led Zeppelin III (1970) sessions and the country-bar inflicted \\"Down by the Seaside\\", the melodic hard rocker \\"Night Flight\\" and bar blues jam \\"Boogie With Stu\\" were recorded between 1971-1972. But these are not rehashes from pivotal records; these are strong, legitimate songs that shows Zeppelin expressing, not indulging. And the recent songs are just as good, so good that you'd think Zeppelin recorded all these songs at around the same time.<br /><br />Take \\"In the Light\\", for example. \\"In the Light\\" is, like \\"Kashmir\\", a Middle Eastern-flavored song but whereas \\"Kashmir\\" was pounding and aggressive, \\"In the Light\\" is more deliberately paced, yet utterly involving. The song begins with a chilling Moroccan synthesizer backed up by Page's use of violin bow on an acoustic guitar before Plant's strangely futuristic vocal drone lures you in and eventually Bonzo's pounding drums come into play. \\"Ten Years Gone\\" is a wistful love song filled with a lot of guitar overdubs that is neither overwhelming or compressed; a melodic ballad with delicious layers. And just as the first disc begins with a rock song of sexually charged lyrics, the second disc ends the same way with \\"Sick Again\\", thus book-ending this monster double-album.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin followed Physical Graffiti with the flawed but enjoyable Presence (1976) and the groovy In Through the Out Door (1979), which wind up being Zeppelin's last studio album. At around that time, Zeppelin became wrongly affiliated with the so-called \\"dinosaur rock\\" acts of the 1970's like Yes, Genesis and Pink Floyd and were attacked by punk rock bands and simple-minded journalists as bloated, indulgent, excessive, boring, etc, etc. But Zeppelin's greatest albums, from the self-titled debut album to Physical Graffiti, have stood the test of time and are now rightly recognized for what they are: towering classics of 1970's hard rock.<br /><br />Arguably their greatest expression of artistic credibility, Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelin's magnum opus; their best album to date. Rarely do double-albums come as intoxicating, exhilarating and rewarding as Graffiti.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation.t indulging.

B000N2HBSO|3.0|After reading this monolithic 800 page biography I gained a deeper sense into Lincoln's soul and now have an appreciation of why he was so loved.<br /><br />My main criticism of the book is that it is clear that Goodwin has a soft spot in her heart for Lincoln and his magnanimous character deserves it.  However, as a politician Lincoln grew government exponentially and overreached the Executive branch's constitutional authority possibly to save the Union and possibly for the self preservation of his presidency.  Regardless of the reason many of his actions were absolutely illegal, according to the ratified constitution and that deserves thorough contemplation. I would have appreceated further exploration of these overreaching actions especially since they had enormous negative consequences for the nation. Moreover, although Goodwin spends some effort navigating Lincoln's positions and complicated set of thoughts regarding slavery and rightly points out the importance of digesting these views within the context of the times. I felt that this area was not as comprehensive as it should have been. Frankly Goodwin spends much more time relating the Washington social scene and Kate Chase's role in society than this infinitely more important subject.<br /><br />Goodwin does provide tremendous insight into Lincoln's personality and leadership and the political landscape within the framework of his cabinet which was mainly comprised of his main newly formed Republican rivals.  A president during the 1800's appointed Vice Presidents almost strictly for political reasons to get elected. And while cabinet members played a critical role in the administration they too were often appointed for political reasons to appease different factions of the party.  Lincoln was a masterful politician and Goodwin provides insight into how he navigated this terrain.<br /><br />The western prairie lawyer was greatly underestimated. His poor dress, goofy countenance and folksy western stories provided fodder for the media elite to scoff. But what emerges is a brilliant leader who could look at the most complicated problems and somehow relate the right track for the public with great clarity and realism. Goodwin illustrates this with a favorite metaphor of Lincoln's distinction between \\"accepting slavery where it already existed while doing everything possible to curtail its spread\\".  In response to the Kansas-Nebraska act while other politicians would have referred to the act of slavery spreading west as a \\"Trojan horse\\" of evil, Lincoln rather said \\"If I saw a venomous snake crawling in the road, any man would say I might seize the nearest stick and kill it. But if I found that snake in bed with my children, that would be another question. I might hurt the children more than the snake and it might bite them. ..but if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children would be taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them there with them, I take it no man would say there was any question how I ought to decide!...the new territories are the newly made bed to which our children are to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up with them or not.\\" This type of insight makes the book worth reading but you'll need additional insight beyond Goodwin's interpertation to get a more accurate perspective regarding Lincoln's leadership and its affect on the nation.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Brings up interesting ideas about nature versus nurture and the possibility of a murder gene.  Found the book to be a great read.  Fast and interesting.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|We ordered this CD because we saw a special featuring Robert Plant and the Band of Joy and we[[ASIN:B003NWS5AO Band of Joy]and hoped that some of the cuts would be from that performance. Although there were few we recognized, the songs on the CD were great--classic rock with a bit of country feel to them.

B004LWZWDS|5.0|I saw this film when it was first released, at the cinema, on VHS and DVD.  The Blu-ray release looks fabulous - crystal clear, vivid and exact colors - every detail is there.  For Francophiles who love this period, there is no movie that captures it better.  The costumes are incredible - two of Glenn Close's gowns are almost exact copies of dresses worn by Madame de Pompadour in two Boucher paintings.  I hope that everyone who raved about the recent Eurotrash, \\"Marie Antoinette\\" movie see this film and can appreciate the quality.  This film is a masterpiece - \\"Marie Antoinette\\" is a pretentious disaster!  Not to be confused with the excellent b&w version starring Norma Shearer.
B001DSNELK|5.0|at least i have this edition . i wait for so long to get this edition because can not delivery to my country. i love this figure and all most collection insert it in. i know it's just dvd but limited for me
B002GYVRRI|4.0|I recently bought the 5.1 mix of KC's \\"Lizard\\" and was quite blown away by it. So I resolved to buy all of the other Crim 5.1 mixes, and this is the next one I bought. And so it sounds great... But is nowhere near the revelation that \\"Lizard\\" was. Maybe mixer Steven Wilson was just particularly *into* \\"Lizard?\\" Or maybe he thought \\"Red\\" sounded fine the way it was, and thus didn't change it much? Either way, it sounds good, but not very different from the last (30th anniversary) mix.<br /><br />However, the video material -- a live performance from the 4-piece 1973 line-up -- is great, and even alone without the bonus audio tracks and various mixes of the album, is well worth the $20 you'll pay for this. (You've probably seen clips of it on Youtube, but it looks and sounds much better here.) So overall, this is a very worthy upgrade to your old copy of \\"Red.\\"

B007FDE4Y8|5.0|Got this stablizer for a few days now. Very impressive!<br /><br />Like one user from another review. at one time, I thought this stablizer is a junk, because in the first two days, no matter how hard I tried to mount my 5D mark ii with the heavy 24-70mm lens (total weight is 3.88 lb  < the max 5 lb limit), I just can't make it balance. The top part is just try to fall to arbitrary direction.  Then I realize the included weight is not heavy enough to stablize the camera on the gravity axis.<br /><br />I changed to a lighter lens (16-35mm and total weight is 3.1 lb) and Hurrah! perfect balance achieved!<br /><br />I currently don't have any prim lens and will purchase a few this year. But that is my problem. Because I understand it is better shoot videos with prim lenses. they are lighter and have bigger apertures.<br /><br />As of the lack of manual, My suggestion is to download a copy of Steadicam Merlin's user manual,  that is very useful to help you to master this stabilizer. (e.g. two hands techniqe.)<br /><br />One recommendation for the manualfacture, if you can supply one more weight unit, the stabilizer can be more versatile and my experienced (and other user's) frustration could be avoid. and thus, they can truly tout the maximum supported weight can be 5 lb.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I found this book thoroughly enjoyable with lots of twists and turns.  It held my interest and found I couldn't wait to get to the end (it sure surprised me!!!!).  Also enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the European destinations.  I would definitely read more from this author!
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I didn't listen to Lady Gaga's music until her interview with Oprah.  I thought of Gaga as being out of it, but her music lyrics talk about societies issues we gor through every day.  I felt in love with her interest in young people, her encouragement to people to accept themselves:  Born This Way, has not only help people accept and love themselves just the way they are, but has also given some people the confidence they have never had.  I learn she is catholic, and love family.  I will recomend this CD to anyone who needs a confidence pumpped.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The popularity of this five book compilation is unquestionably high, judging by the nearly 500 reviews already posted.  For the most part, I support the 4- and 5-star ratings awarded, but I have niggling reservations.  On the one hand, the running story through the five books is compelling, with segments of the history of the micro-world that Hugh Howey has created being expertly revealed in each of the five books, ensuring the reader's interest does not wane.  On the other hand, though, the pace of the five individual books is quite uneven, with the shorter books 1-3 being far more gripping than the remaining two;  these last two seeming to have been forced into double the length of the others without a corresponding doubling of the story content.<br /><br />Enjoyable:  yes, but not perfect.  You might find yourself skimming through the last book as I did, rather than savouring each word as I did with the first.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Even though I love science fiction, I'm normally not one to read apocalyptic genre sci-fi.  When searching for another book, I found Wool along with the huge numbers of good reviews.  I decided to give it a go and plunked down my hard earned $5.99 (an incredibly reasonable amount until you consider that same amount could have purchased a large DQ Blizzard). I must say, I loved Wool.  It created a very compelling and complete universe populated with very believable characters.  The entire story--through the ending--was very satisfying and left enough story threads for, hopefully, a sequel or two.<br /><br />The only criticism I have--and please take this as a totally personal opinion--is there simply is too much narrative.  The one issue I see with straight to digital novels is that there is no compelling reason to engage in word economy.  There are no editors pleading and cajoling to cut out the superfluous and concentrate on what is absolutely necessary to tell the story, and there are no publishers concerned with the price of a printed page.  If there had been, Wool would have been much shorter.  There were times I simply began hopping over paragraph after paragraph, knowing I was missing nothing critical to the main story or subplots.<br /><br />Other than that, though, Wool was a fine novel, and I look forward to entering the silo again--even if it costs me a Blizzard with extra whipped cream.  Yes, I'm hooked.
0066620996|5.0|This is really a fantastic book with useful insights. Jim shows that the keys to success are not always what you'd expect, but not necessarily surprising either. What's so refreshing about this book is that it uses evidence to show that much of the conventional wisdom about what's important in business, like star CEOs and complex strategies, is often less successful than common sense, focus, and leadership guided by traditional virtues.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Game play and concept are great but full of frustrating glitches. Often it will lock up and when I am able to get it running again my energy is gone and it has lost tasks that were performed before the glitch. If the recharge can get the bugs out definately worth a play.

It's an unfortunate side-effect of a lot of 5-star books, but to be honest if there was a 6th star, if you could somehow create one and add it to a book and only one book, for me Slammed would be the recipient of that 6th star.<br /><br />_______________<br /><br />Thoughts<br />My thoughts<br />My thoughts on this book<br />are<br />overwhelming<br />consuming<br />screaming<br />adoring<br />exasperating<br />suffocating<br />heart-stopping<br /><br />Heart<br />My heart<br />My heart has stopped<br />Its stopped beating for the passionate embrace to devour other words on pages because it seams to have read the ones it needed to feel complete.<br /><br />So<br />I wait<br />and I hope<br />I wait and I hope that the maker and creator of these words that I have found so all-consuming, will make and create more.<br />More<br />and more<br />and more<br />Of the words that when combined create pages and those pages create chapters and those chapters create a book.<br /><br />A book that I know I will love.<br />And my thoughts<br />My thoughts on that book<br />Will be<br />overwhelming<br />consuming<br />screaming<br />adoring<br />exasperating<br />suffocating<br />heart-stopping<br /><br />And once again<br />My heart<br />My heart will stop.<br />_______________<br /><br />So Colleen, please, please, please write a 3rd book.

0307956350|1.0|What a dull book. Page after page of \\"Oh no, I feel so sorry for myself. Whatever will I do?\\" Followed by page after page of denial, justification for that denial and then more denial. Interspersed with page after page of incompetence and ignorance. Her actions in this book don't make a shred of sense. She deals with characters whose foreheads are tattooed \\"I am not what I'm pretending to be\\" but ignores every bit of it for months. This woman is (Mini-spoiler perhaps, just get over it) an accomplished CIA assassin. How could this naive  -- yea, this stupid -- women have survived two days in that world, let alone be responsible for untold numbers of high-profile political assassinations? How could anyone expect the reader to believe it?<br /><br />The book is unforgivably boring. The plot is unforgivably stupid. And the protagonist is unforgivably unbelievable. Reading this one requires willful suspension of your entire brain. May be the worst so-called thriller I've read in years. Seriously.<br /><br />I notice the other 1-star reviewers mainly object to the non-linear narrative. While it's unnecessarily choppy, it certainly isn't a problem to follow. The problem is trying to stay awake while reading this turkey. At least the time line gives you something to think about for a paragraph while you determine where you are.

All of this greatness was done before Mustaine turned into a d-bag.<br /><br />Even though I'm too young to have a comparison of the original soundings of the first prints, this reissue sounds really nice on my turntable and sony speakers.<br /><br />Definitely worth the $$ spent.<br /><br />Thanks!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|The concept of merging two genres is enough to carry the day. The typical Western, complete with nasty cattle rancher lording it over a hard-scrabble town and a host of time-worn characters, is melded with an alien invasion, whose aliens look and act a lot like the ones made famous in Sigourney Weaver's epic Alien trilogy. The aliens do typical alien things, like capturing humans and experimenting on them, and the alien spaceship is typically ill-lit with dripping moisture. Apparently aliens see well in the dark but have few plumbing skills. No problem. From my point of view, it is precisely the collection of these familiar characters, characteristics, and dialogue that make the movie so much fun. One minute the spoiled son of the mean rancher is drunkenly shooting up the dusty main street...the next minute, an amnesiac man with a peculiar wristband is shooting up a mini-spaceship which has lasso'ed and carried off a host of townsfolk. One woman in town seems to know more than she should about the matter. I simply enjoyed the whole film. I loved seeing a very experienced cast (including Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Clancy Brown) spouting lines that could have come from any cowboy movie from the past half century. I loved seeing a band of Indians killing aliens with spears, and I really got a kick out of the mysterious woman speaking fluent Chiricahua to the chief of the Indians. There is a plot, but I paid very little attention to it. I was too busy enjoying the clash of cliches, which was very nicely filmed in New Mexico. This is a great popcorn movie and well worth seeing.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Growing up as a big fan of games like Myst and Riven, I was so excited to find this game. Definitely challenging and a lot of fun. I really hope more adventure games come from Fire Maple because they really are top notch games!<br /><br />THE LOST CITY starts by dumping you into a mysterious environment filled with jungles and ruins. What happens next remains with you. The locations and graphics are astounding, and truly bring a sense of adventure to the storyline. The puzzles are tricky in a couple spots, and had me scratching my head quite a bit until something clicked into place. Navigation is pretty straight-forward, by touching the screen over what appears to be an exit from the current location, you can move ahead. The satchel with items is simple and easy to use, and the journal helps in automatically recording clues you gather around the island. These can be referenced when trying to solve the various puzzles.<br /><br />All said, THE LOST CITY is a great game, especially if you enjoyed THE SECRET OF GRISLY MANOR by Fire Maple Games. Definitely check this one out!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second book of the Hunger Games series. This book is probably more interesting that the first because you don't have to read all of the background information. I read it in 3 days. It was very hard to put down. Very interesting for all ages.
0307956350|1.0|This book is ridiculous. Painful to read totally uninteresting. Poorly written, it jumps all over the place. The characters are confused and so is the reader.  Don't waste your time!
B000059QYB|4.0|This item was purchased for a friend as a Birthday gift. This item was not purchased for my collection My friend is enjoying the Music
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|Thie special edition is a must for any movie lover. We loved all the extras and seeing all the actors making the movie. 2 Thumbs up!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I felt the author gave you such an insight into the character of Katniss that there was no doubt in mind how the book would end - and I was right!
1577314808|4.0|There's a lot to gain from Tolle's words. I've learned a lot from this book. With that said, this work is not perfect. What I did not like is that the book does very little to offer, explain the importance of having BALANCE in life. There is a great deal of fun, laughter, and happiness to be experienced in (physical)life, and pushing it aside to constantly check for or to live through a filter of Spiritual Identity will not bring about those experiences.<br /><br />I most strongly agree with G. Fishman's Amazon review titled \\"Very powerful, but don't take it TOO seriously\\". Fishman does a better job at explaining what I want to/can't/won't.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book was very well written and led you excitingly through the events.  All the characters were well defined by the author.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|If it worked 100% of the time it would be fantastic! This app always times out and force closes. This app could definitely use some fine tuning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would highly recommend this whole series.  Interesting plots, super fast read.  If you have a Kindle, I would also say to buy all three books in the series at one time, as you receive a small discount.  Believe me you will want to read every last book!
B00755646W|4.0|So FINALLY we get the epic Truth or Dare on Blu-ray after 21 years, and the quality of this HD transfer is so GORGEOUS!!  Madge looks stunning from every angle.  This film really depicted Madonna when she was at the top of her career, she was totally untouchable.<br /><br />From the rain of Japan, through threats of arrest for 'public indecency' in Toronto Canada, this documentary follows Madonna on her 1990 'Blond Ambition' concert tour. I love how it was filmed in black and white, but with the concert pieces in blazing color.  It's truly an intimate look at the work of the mastermind marketing diva/music performer she is.  Highlights include the touching prayer circles with the dancers before each performance, a fun game of Truth or Dare involving a bottle of Evian, and funny bed games with the dance troupe. I laughed, I cried, I have always thoroughly enjoyed this film!<br /><br />I gave this release 4 out of 5 stars because I am disappointed that there is no bonus material included here.  I own this film on Laserdisc, DVD and VHS, and at least the VHS version has two bonus live performances from the Blond Ambition Tour (Like A Prayer and Hanky Panky).  I find it very strange they couldn't put those extra performances on this Blu-ray edition considering how far technology has come and there is no shortage of space on the disc.<br /><br />Record labels love to complain about the status of the industry and how people aren't buying as much as they used to, but if they would wake up and make the item at hand more enticing, then people would for sure part with their hard earned money a lot easier.<br /><br />If you want to see the REAL DEAL queen of pop work the stage and camera, pick up this documentary.  It's a real show & tell unlike any other :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love playing Spider.  I enjoy the variety of games.  I may not win often but always come back and keep at it.  Very User friendley.

0671027344|1.0|I bought this book because of all the hype around it. Too bad that's all there is to it. This book is very cliche, the main character isn't even realistic and seems very fake, especially with the wording, to be honest. The loners at my school are more human than the main character in this story, which makes sense because they're not fake. I think this book isn't worth your time.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|five stars because idiots don't know how to review an item. so just to offset the idiots on this app. five stars. trollololol
B007K3JCAE|3.0|I've got to concur with the review that talks about pawning off an online \\"UltraViolet\\" license as a digital copy. I've played around with this technology and it is not ready for prime time. I don't want to have to go to multiple places to watch movies that I've purchased.  If I want to watch a movie on my iPad/iPhone, then I should be able to launch it from the Video's App.  I shouldn't be forced to go into some buggy 3rd party app to stream a movie that I theoretically purchased.<br /><br />But in all honesty, I feel Warner Bros in general has not been playing fair in regards to \\"Digital Copies\\".  Even prior to UltraViolet, they often distributed digital copies with new releases but only allowed a very short time frame to redeem those copies via iTunes or for use in Windows Media Player.  In my case, I always bought the more expensive Combo packages in part to get the digital copy.  However, I just started redeeming those digital copies recently after getting an iPad. With almost every studio, I didn't have a problem redeeming the digital copies - even if the blu-ray or DVD was several years old.  But I was locked out of almost every Warner Bros digital copy because it was \\"expired\\".  The expiration date was listed on the disk, but in fine print.  I find it ludicrous that an unused digital copy redemption code should ever expire.<br /><br />But back to the movie - Sherlock Holmes 2 was a very entertaining movie, though I felt the first movie had a more logical flow. And with Sherlock - logic is EVERYTHING.  This movie seems to move from scene to scene often with very tenuous connections and a thin plot to hold things together.  But with that said, Robert Downey Jr & Jude Law are both great in the movie and it's the quintessential popcorn movie to enjoy on a Friday night.<br /><br />My new philosophy - if a movie comes with a true Digital Copy, then I'll buy the blu-ray combo pack.  If it comes with a UltraViolet copy, I'll bypass the blu-ray and just buy the 1080pdigital copy on iTunes.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|really like shark dash. different than most other angry bird type games. try it. its free. I guarantee u will like it.
0307279189|5.0|Born to Run is an amazing book. It's the incredible, true story of the author's journey to find out why his feet hurt after only a few miles of running despite top of the line running shoes and Dr. recommendations.<br /><br />Christopher McDougall begins his search for answers in the Copper Canyons of Mexico where he meets and befriends an almost mythical man named Caballo Blanco. Caballo Blanco has close ties to the Tarahumar tribe who are widely known as some of the fastest endurance runners in the world.<br /><br />The author then takes you through an almost anthrolopogical look at why our bodies are designed to run. It's a fascinating read that ultimately pits the Tarahumara running tribe of Mexico against ultramarathoners from the U.S. in a 50 mile race. All runners will love this book and learn a lot about their body mechanics and how basic the need to run is. I learned a lot from reading this book and was entertained throughout the duration of the book. This is a must read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is BY FAR the best books I have EVER read. I've read a LOT of books, and I've read a few books on erotica that were pretty good. But this book combines erotica with a story line that makes for a read that you CANNOT put down. I'm on the third book already because I can't put them down. James writes like NO ones else. She mixes erotica with fiction that brings the story to LIFE. I feel like it's real when I'm reading it. BUY IT, READ IT and ENJOY IT
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Don't usually go for these type of games, but I'm really enjoying it!<br /><br />Glad I read the reviews beforehand, as I've not had any problems.<br /><br />For someone new to the genre, I would have liked an optional tutorial, but slowly I'm getting the hang of things; just not very good at moving the &quot;blocks&quot; around.<br />Was surprised at the size of the landscape and having to buy extras. Would have preferred paying for the game with extra stuff and those hardcore fans could buy their extras.<br /><br />Still am not sure how to get more acorns. . . .
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am completely addicted!  As has been posted in many previous reviews, you CAN exit the game without shutting your tablet down. I won't pay-to-play, but acorns can be earned, if verrrrrrry slowly. Overall, one of the better free apps I've played!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is so awesome cause you make your own village I play it 24/7. I love this app<br />the app + kindle=awesomeness plus its free
3836528347|1.0|For anyone who is interested in mid-century advertising, this book will be a disappointment. As an example, a number of legends for the ads are incorrect. How can you show a 1968 Plymouth in an ad dated 1967? Also, none of  the legends credit the ad agency that created it. The ads themselves are poorly recreated, fuzzy and off-color. The choice of ads indicates the authors used ads that were easy to find, no serious research was done, they just picked what was handy. Save your money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the app it is very awesome i love it because it shares the true word if you agree pray for the troops in america home or away just pray
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is awesome! There is no stalling. Amd the game is always fun! This angry birds is a tiny bit hard, just keep at it! Enjoying the game.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I don't even know what any of the scales or measures mean I just have fun making music with this cool app. its delightful.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|loved the game very addicting and fun it is truelly a cool game but u gotta pay for a lot of stuff
B004LWZW8I|2.0|The movie begins with a great deal of excitement and a sense of some ancient parable of forboding.<br />Yet it then disintegrates into a series of gratuitous violent scenes. Mickey Rourke is good for that kind<br />of action. Freida Pinto (of Slum Dog Millionaire fame) is a welcomed addition to the cast but not even she can save this script for scene after scene of murder and mayhem. A good film for an after-football game when you team lost. A good way to vent!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I just bought my Kindle Fire and downloaded the Hotmail app to sync my e-mail, contacts and calendar.  The contact sync worked great with the onboard CONTACTS on the Fire and the mail was a snap to use.  But no calendar.  Even though Hotmail said it was syncing my 6 online calendars.  I installed this app and everything synced perfectly.  I have access to all of my Hotmail calendars.  I can edit on my desktop or my Kindle.  I can access the CalenGoo app whether I am online or not.  I couldn't be more pleased with this one. It's a little spendy, but it works.
0307592731|2.0|I think I might have enjoyed it more if I had listened to it on a long car ride instead of investing the time to read it.  I, probably like many others who purchased this book, generally enjoy this type of writing.  I would think it an archetypical feeling to want to escape to an adventure to re-establish one's foundations in life.  However, I often found myself wanting to escape from the Strayed's writing.  It was monotonous and self-loathing.  Nonetheless, Strayed did keep me interested enough to trudge through writing to see if it got better.  There are far better narratives out there for the time; this will drag you along with it to see what happens next, but like passing so many bends on the trail, your disappointed when all you see is another tree.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not the type of game i was expecting, but i gave it a shot and ive been hooked since the first screen tap! Great job Gameloft!!
B007M6P01O|5.0|The Walking Dead is an awesome show overall but this final episode really left me anxious and dying for more.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Hey, I will just share my thoughts shortly... I'm doing software development services and the book is changing the direction to make more impact with less costs. It does not give clear guidance, but learns to look different way and take different approach.
0345803485|2.0|Very disappointed.  It is pure and simple erotica which would be fine if not for the female lead who is written like she is a 8th grader (and I apologize to 8th graders for saying that)  I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking, \\"if she has this character saying holy crap one more time I'm going to throw this book across the room.  Too much repeating of two or three words or phases....like the lip biting that is on every other page and the \\"holy crap...or holy f--- that is repeated SO many times, along with telling the reader, in every way possible, that the lead male character is handsome....OK...I get it...he is handsome, move on.  You don't have to tell me on every page how good looking he is!!!!!!!<br /><br />Plot good, erotica good, writing leaves a lot to be desired.  Good hook at beginning and end.  Characters bio did not match some of the things she had character doing. Just very juvenile in many ways.  The good thing she does is hook you at the end, for you find yourself wanting to know what his story is. I would read next two (if my stomach can take the silliness) just for that.<br /><br />People talking about this book on talk shows tells me they have not read it.  It is NOT about women being in control in board rooms etc., so they want to be submissive in the bedroom...it is about a wealthy tycoon (aren't they always) seducing a young, recent college grad who is a virgin and the pull and tug of him trying to introduce her to sex as a submissive.  Read it and enjoy but don't expect to read what you have heard described on TV talk shows.
B0046MVVOW|4.0|Hi ya-all...<br /><br />I like a wide range of music. I like especially, \\"We R Who We R\\", \\"TiK ToK,\\" \\"Blah Blah Blah,\\" \\"Blow,\\" and \\"Take It Off,\\" and a few others.<br /><br />Sounds she's my kinda girl ;=)  But, since I'm just a Dinosaur, so...<br /><br />I like rippin my own MP3, as I want 320kbps, and I cant figure out what I getting, if I download. eMusic, is OK this way, at least in this way...<br /><br />C- ya...
0307949486|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  Little too much info but it only shows the amount of research that went into it.<br />Could not put it down.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Um...hello? Its the Bible app. Who wouldn't give it five stars? It has reading plans and devotions for you to choose from and they're really effective.Its less hassle for you to carry around your real. ible. And there are different versions to your liking so you can have a better understanding.So get it! Its not a bad app. (Says the little Christian Girl)
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like this game a lot. Not sure I would've paid for it, but as a free game it's excellent.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This is a prequel, telling the story of Jack's last days in the U.S. Army back in 1997. Three women have been murdered in a small town in Mississippi. The sheriff happens to be a gorgeous ex-Marine. There's a roaring midnight train, a great cast of characters, a serial killer and a plot that speeds along faster than a Maserati. What's not to like?
B000URDEB0|5.0|This album is so epic! When I listen to it, I feel like I am right there, a part of it. I love the larger sound and theatrical quality.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|great book<br />I read all three of them in a few days. It has a good story line even. This will be a book i read again and again :)
B006T5LGXA|4.0|A great show and set list. Sounds great. Nice to have a live version of Clones which sounds great with guitars turned up. A negative is that there are no liner notes, no mention of who the current band members are and no pictures from the tour. A little more effort here would have been nice.
B005NLNSRI|5.0|this is a very well made movie that everyone will will enjoy.<br />great humor and storyline. george clooney and all the caracters are priceless<br />i love this film!

0545265355|5.0|Very good series!! Buy this!!If you like to emmurse yourself in a whole world, this is the story for you. All readers regardless of age will like this.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|This is my second favorite Eminem album after The Marshall Mathers Lp. This is a new Eminem. There's no anti mom songs, no anti Kim songs, no celeb bashing or spoof, and no ''woe is me'' songs. He appears to have come full circle on this album. It's a mature album and I can't understand why some of his Stans hate it. He's a grown man, time to make grown man music.<br /><br />I enjoy Em's flow and wordplay on songs like ''On Fire '', ''Cold Wind Blows'', ''WTP'', ''Cinderella Man'' and ''Almost Famous''. These songs show he's still got it and take you back to his Slim Shady days but it's his personal songs that hit me the most.<br /><br />''Love The Way You Lie'' is clearly about his abusive relationship with Kim and he really pulls you in from the first verse and takes you inside a co dependency relationship and the fact that he has Rihanna sing on the track makes it even better. I also enjoy ''Going Through Changes''. His verse about Kim was the best part. ''I'm not placing any blame, lord knows I never been a saint''. Wow, no longer blaming others for his misery? Good stuff<br /><br />I have to admit I brought this album because of ''Space Bound''. I LOVE that song. One of the best songs he ever wrote. He never says the woman's name which is a change for him and that's only if he's talking about a woman. I also heard this song was about his love affair with drugs. Who knows? Another favorite is ''So Bad''. Em has never written a song about his sexual prowess before so when I first heard it, I laughed but it's grown on me.<br /><br />Overall a great album. A mix of personal stories and hip hop word play. I love it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very challenging game after the first few easy levels. love it. especially for free app of the day! !!!!!!!!!<br />highly recommend game.
B00000ADG2|4.0|There's nothing I can write about this album that hasn't already been written. Yes she's the greatest female rapper of all times, Yes this album is a classic, and Yes we need a part TWO. I love this album and play it often. My favorites tracks are ''Lost Ones'', ''Ex Factor'', ''Nothing Even Matters'', and ''Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You''. Very personal songs. They make me really reflect on my pass loves and losses. L Boogie might be crazy now, but back in the 90's she was THAT CHICK and that shouldn't be forgotten.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book that I couldn't put down on a mini trip to the beach.  Looking forward to readying the next one.
B0049D1TCM|3.0|This is gonna go down as Nicki's best work. I just heard some of her second album and can only sum it up in one word . . . BAD! This album on the other hand is alot of fun to listen to. The beats and some of the guest appearences take away from Nicki's bad rapping. Yes, she's pretty and can sing (alittle) but she can't rap to save her life. I mean I don't even think the girl could rap a gift.<br /><br />For example. ''Roman's Revenge'' w/Eminem. Em's two verse's make the whole song. Nicki verse was weak. She has to come at Lil Kim a lot harder than ''hang it up. FLAT SCREEN''. She also falls flat on ''Did It On Em''. Once again her verse is weak and the beat covers for it. In the song she calls other black females ''Nappy Headed Hoes'' which is strange cause she's a black woman herself (or did she forget?)<br /><br />The stand out tracks are ''Super Bass''(which is the best song on the album), ''Your Love'' (the one track where her rapping isn't so bad), ''Moment For Life'' (cause of Drake. Once again Nicki's 123 rapping falls short), and ''Fly'' (Rihanna and Nicki sound good together)<br /><br />Overall not a bad album but not a great one either. This will be her best work
044042321X|5.0|Lovely grahic novel, wonderful artistry. Very enjoyable to read, definately one for the collection. Cant wait for the next novel to come out
1400069289|5.0|New York Times investigative reporter Charles Duhigg has assembled a compelling set of stories about the overarching influence habit plays in our lives, its neurological underpinnings, how habits develop, how they may be altered, and how they may be used to undermine us.  Duhigg's curiosity leads him to variegated and interesting applications of the concept of habit formation, from Tony Dungy's quest for a super bowl ring to the selling of Pepsodent, a milestone in advertising history.<br /><br />These stories of corporate manipulation are among Duhigg's most persuasive.  Most appalling was his story of an Iowa housewife who married early and accomplished little, except that she was adept at gambling.  Her humdrum life became rewarding when she was able to order comped suites for friends' weddings because Harrah's valued her patronage so highly.  Her anxiety was always relieved when she sat down at the black jack table.  Harrah's casino showered her with personal attention.  Even after she went bankrupt, Harrah's continued to call, making offers of benefits she could not refuse.  Finally, after many hard knocks, she was given a second chance when her parents left a nice inheritance.  Of course, she continued to answer Harrah's calls (they got upset when she declined to come) and gambled the inheritance away.<br /><br />Then there is Boutique Target, spending vast sums to find statistical changes in spending patterns when women get pregnant.  Once identified as a likely pregnancy (when her receipts show increased purchases of lotions, expanded waist pants, etc.), a woman begins to receive relevant discount offers, subtly hidden within coupon books.  Pregnant women are \\"a gold mine,\\" leading to infant, child, and family expenditures worth thousands.  The Boutique is going to be sure they get their share of the action.  Like Harrah's, they take advantage of customer habit to influence purchases to their benefit.<br /><br />To the good, Duhigg recounts the story of a young man named Travis whose drug-addicted parents taught him none of the social skills required for success or even for holding down a menial job.  He was a bright kid who knew that when the house was clean, that meant mom and dad had switched from heroin to meth and things were about to get seriously out of control.  Travis dropped out of school, failed at McDonald's, then got a break when he was hired as a barista at Starbucks.<br /><br />It seems that Starbucks had determined that world domination was based on convincing large numbers of people to pay four dollars a throw for a cup of coffee.  This meant not only the addition of special nutrients such as heavy cream and sugary Italian flavoring, but also the emphatic recognition of the customer's personal value to the outlet.  Starbucks taught its baristas to show care and consideration for customers.  Travis took fifty hours of in-house courses, equivalent of a college semester, learning habits of positive customer relations.  He wrote out and memorized  the LATTE method: Listen to the customer.  Acknowledge their complaint.  Take action by solving the problem.  Explain why the problem occurred.  Travis paid attention.  At age 26, he managed two Starbucks outlets, had no debt and a 401K.  Travis had been socialized by a corporation.<br /><br />The first third of the book deals with habit formation (cue, craving, routine, reward) and an appendix tells the reader how to change habits.  The program is a bit reductive and sounds like cognitive behavioral therapy by another name, which it pretty much is.  Nuances of interpersonal differences, the effects of various psychological states and diagnoses, the limits imposed by life circumstance, these are not factors that Duhigg treats in detail.<br /><br />To his credit, Duhigg deals with higher functions than the simple changing of unconscious processes, like changing a pattern of cookie eating in the afternoon (a rather facile but helpful piece about his own habit change).  His discussion of the success of Alcoholics Anonymous includes speculations that belief is sometimes necessary to overcome a life-long, pervasive habit, such as alcohol addiction.  It is insufficient to deal with the physical addiction and to replace the habit with a new routine (e.g., calling a sponsor or going to a meeting instead of a bar).<br /><br />The application of a belief that things can get better has been shown to assist addicts who suffer stress or temptation.  Duhigg points out that  when the chips were down, Tony Dungy's football team failed to apply the positive habits that had taken them to the playoffs.  They failed to believe that the habits would work in the clutch.  After Dungy lost a son, the team thereafter came together for his sake and won the Superbowl.  Duhigg attributes the win to belief.  It seems equally likely that this success came from increased motivation and affiliation among team members rallying around their beloved coach.<br /><br />In my experience, clients often change when they embrace values more important to them than the rewards of a self-destructive habit.  Rather than drinking, the client chooses to establish habits consistent with enhancing a child's life.  A four-decade smoker stops cold turkey when his new love demands kissing sweet breath.  It is the researcher's job to perform the experiments necessary to establish such a point.  Duhigg, as a reporter, has done a yeoman's job of ferreting out the available findings and interviewing the authors.  He cannot be held responsible for what social science has not yet ascertained.<br /><br />What Duhigg does best is to spin a fine story, from Paul O'Neill turning Alcoa around by concentrating on habits of safety to the seeming exclusion of everything else (he knew that establishment of habits of safe production would lead to habits of efficient production), to the story of Travis's socialization at Starbucks.  If he goes a bit far afield by shoe horning the Montgomerybus boycott into a story of habit change, so what?  It's still a fun story and well worth reading.  The world may not change, but lots of people will be better off for having read this book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|,this app is so fun i can nat get off of my toy now cuz of ths thtia is awsome
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|crashes my kindle at least once an hour. much worse than that,  after the most recent crash, all the timers for collecting resources got reset to 278 hours!!!!! now the game is completely useless. i spent money in the game,too. bad, buggy software, horrible support. they refused to help when I called. amazon was much more helpful. I will never download another gameloft product.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|After devouring all three books in a matter of days, I anxiously awaited the film and was not disappointed. The director captured the moody, eerie tone of the setting, the events and the characters with brilliance. Could have done without as much explicitness--because, in the book these horrific details were shown factually, without any aggrandizing-- so it CAN be done. This is where the director didn't need to go so far, IMO. Overall though, a tense thriller.
B004NH8BWU|5.0|I commend her for the candid disclosure of her parenting style.  It has taken a lot of criticism but I think we are raising spoiled and entitled kids in America.  I am not a believer of making your kids play instruments and skip social activities.  I am raising my boys to play competitive athletics and focus on academics so they can be leaders and not just very smart individual contributors in life.  However, making kids work hard and not giving everyone an award for participation is being honest...I really enjoyed the book even though I do not 100% agree with her.  That is not the point.  It is one way and you can learn from it.
B007G5K066|1.0|Bought this hoping for a tight, followable spy thriller. Couldn't make it past the 3/4 mark of the film. The story hopped around and the lot of us watching were just plain uninterested in what was going on. Highly disappointed.
B006NFKUF6|4.0|Very good story line.The graphics are ok.As soon as I bought the free one I knew I would like it.
0783230370|5.0|Arnold and DiVito at their best. Cute fish-out-of-water story that had me laughing and sniffling. Absolutely unbelievable story, but who cares? People don't turn into wolves or vampires, either.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an excellent read as the final book to the hunger games trilogy.  I could not set the book down so be sure laundry and all your chores are finished before you start.  Very entertaining and fast read.
B00753MBHA|3.0|What Happened!?<br /><br />Blood of the Nations was every bit as spectacular as any UDO fronted Accept album.  Blood of the Nations was an amazing album that debuted another new lead singer. 5 Stars no question!  Then they follow up with this!?<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Accept; I have all their releases...<br /><br />Stalingrad: it is simply ok and doesn't really feel like Accept at all; the music and the beats don't even sound like Accept anymore...  Nothing spectacular lyrically, rhythmically, vocally, or musically. I really wish they waited a longer to release it (then it would seem like they put more effort and time into it)....and I am sorry if I offended any Accept fans, but it hurts me more than you because I really want to like it. I am disappointed because I was hoping for something more like Accept.  Rock On!
0439023513|2.0|No spoilers.<br /><br />Gone are the relatable, down to earth characters.  Instead, you get dramaticized, hyped up individuals who aren't nearly as important to the story line as they think they are.  Gone is the strong character of Katniss and in place, a mentally and emotionally unstable, selfish girl who has to be force fed advice before she'll even consider what other people have to say.<br /><br />As for the story, well...it kept me reading, but I do finish most things I start, just out of curiosity.  What it had going for it was a quasi-realistic portrayal of the horrors of war.  What didn't work was how the defining and climactic moments kind of fell flat on their face.  You think, \\"oh, wow, that's interesting, I wonder what will come of it?\\" and then it's just explained away or almost forgotten about.<br /><br />It's really just disappointing in a lot of ways. People complain about how the love triangle (or love \\"V\\" as I prefer to call it) worked out, but I thought that was fine, if not well done.  But how the story resolved was weak, sudden, and left me thinking, \\"so what?\\".  If you've read Hunger Games and Catching Fire, you'll want to read this, so nothing I say really matters, though.  If you've only read Hunger Games, however, I'd recommend stopping there.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|As an IT manager I have deployed many different monitor arms over the years. The issues I face are build quality, stability, aging and versatility.<br />My office has been dropping $180 on average on Humanscale which are very nice items indeed and come with a life time warranty. Being on a tighter budget and deploying them wide scale to everyone who has two monitors became a chore and a budget concern. We tried several that were cheap and they just fell apart or never held the weight right.<br /><br />I love the Ergotron Neo-Flex as it is built incredibly well and is arguable just as good and better in other respects to Humanscale. It clamps the table firmly, the joints are tight and motion is fluid. I have purchased approximately 50 of these and am just about to buy another 50. People like the look of them and they hold 24\\" monitors with no issue.<br /><br />The only thing I can complain about this item is that it will only reach across a table about 20\\" where some others reach 2ft but that is already quite a distance. The other gripe would be that the wire tidy clips are flimsy and fall off.<br /><br />Overall this unit compares to others in the $160 range and is a no brainer for large deployments. Big thumbs up!!!! Just buy it.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Please fix, i really enjoined it when it worked. I know it was only five dollars but now days thats a lot for an app that doesn't  work. hope this problem gets resolved soon. Like the others worked at first, but now you can't  load any pics from any folder to your software.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|I have no idea why it was not nominated for an Oscar, considering the other films. Leo was excellent, the film flawless sans, the bad make-up which I thing was awfull, the older J. Edgard and his companion's make up looked very fake.<br />But I highly recommend the film.
B007M6P01O|5.0|Walking dead is a great series and this is one of the best episodes . Can't wait for the fall .
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I just love this game!!!! Heck it is 3:19 in the morning and gee guess what I was playing? I love the fact that it lets you play different ways, you can choose to do the quest (map) or not.  I have played a lot of different Mahjong games, of course all claiming too being the best,only for me to delete them just a few minutes later. I really have to say it is so worth the 5.00. Were else can you get hours and hours of fun for so little money.  enjoy.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|This is the kind of game that should be the Free App of the Day. A simple, fun, overlooked game that deserves some attention. Good job Retro Dreamer. Keep it up.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I am sorry that I paid for this app.  Letters showed up as zeroes in an .xlsx file I opened.  Word looked like a notepad app with no margins.  Display jerked on my Kindle Fire.  Save your money and pass on this one.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game was fun for a few days until I checked to see why my buildings and animals wasn't ready to collect. They said I had to wait 58 hours. Seriously???? I am uninstalling. Don't waste your time with this game.

B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I have to admit, SMSF wasn't the greatest Train album ever. But this album makes up with it entirely. My favorite song is either \\"This'll be my year,\\" \\"California 37,\\" Or \\"When The Fog Rolls In,\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have not read a book in over 7 years. I am not a reader, even in high school I always opted for the movie route, but when I heard about this book, I had to give it a shot. I was laughing, crying, gasping, and falling in love with the charaters over and over. I bought the paperback for the first one, and I was left so lost at the end I had to buy the kindle edition of the 2nd book. Now, I will have it with me wherever I go!! This is definatly a must read!!!
B006AX6ONI|3.0|The book lacks the structure of a more formal piece, but contains plenty of nuggets of wisdom and a good window into Cuban's character.  Definitely worth the small investment of time/money.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A friend of mine, who is within the 13-19 audience range of this book, recommended this book to me. I read through the first one and I enjoyed it even with it's story book style writing. I won't go into detail so that those who haven't read the book won't find a spoiler, but when reading this book you run into various situations where the book shows it's focus on teens instead of adults. There is nothing wrong with the book in anyway, however, do not buy this book with the intention of reading a dark, graphic story. It has it's moments and like any good book it leaves you wanting to finish it as soon as you can, yet anyone over the age of 20 will catch obvious plot holes. Even after that I would still recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book to read before bed.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|its a matching game with an original twist, you also get powerups and special moves.I would recommend it to anyone.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is amazing espacaly since glu made it makes it twice as awesome! plz get it cince its free! !!!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My conception of the American History has changed after watched this HBO miniseries. What a team our country had back at that time?!<br /><br />John Adams played the most important role in the U.S independence. Despite his no skill in the political arena, his sincerity and determination has set the ground for the country we have nowadays. His belief in freedom (he had no slaves), his loyalty to the law made the birth of our country a model for humankind in general.<br /><br />Only Divine providence can make this happen, a team of men with differences, but very well aligned with the proposal of freedom, in no matter what would happen they did it. From the first incident in Boston, in what brought John Adams to the picture, their wish came true years later with the declaration of independence from the great British Empire.  Of course, it was not an easy task to accomplish; many lives were perished in war.<br /><br />John Adams (athough not much recognized nowaday), Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and the General Jorge Washington were a perfect quartet in the making of America. Each one of them played their role according to their principles and beliefs. They were not perfect; they were men with big dreams for the people and their community. It was an act of selfless; thought, they had some ego.<br /><br />Finally, we cannot forget the major role of women in that time; we would say that they were playing in different arena in supporting the cause, through the wise feedback to their companions. And the most important one was Abigail Adams, she was a rock behind the great John Adams.  We would say that there wouldn't be John Adams without Abigail.<br /><br />Anyway, I will not spoil your curiosity.... I truly recommend buying and watching this masterpiece work. You will be amazed in how well done this series is. I am Brazillian-American living in this great country founded by great men.<br />Enjoy it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Awesome game.  Best part is that you can play many different games in one.  The only thing I didn't like is each page gets harder,  but also you have to get a higher score to at least pass.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game. is the best<br />so much fun and additive.<br />it has great ingine and the gameplay is flawless. this game is great.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Am old enough to say I bought her first albumn when it first came out- still love it and what she's done since.  She took time off to renergize and get over personal losses -but she never lost the music-
B0069JBKHI|5.0|This product is fantastic.<br />great styling and perfectly functioning. everything you would expect.<br />we tried another one that was slightly cheaper but the image quality was terrible and you couldn't zoom.<br />this has great picture in day or night vision.<br />Easy to setup, connects via wifi or ethernet.<br />the magnetic mount is strong yet incredibly easy to move.<br />night vision works perfectly, and the temperature sensor comes in very very handy with baby.<br />I like that when i am on the road i can login and see if the baby is sleeping.<br /><br />my only complaint is that the wifi doesn't support 5ghz networks.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game its a MUST get game its really fun to play its TOTALLY worth the 99&cent;. I love this game. it works PERFECTLY on my kindle fire.
B007IQX1G4|3.0|I really wanted to see this movie based on the mixed reviews, simply because it was a story about a very flawed person.<br />It's hard to watch and in a way doesn't make sense that someone would do what she does even being a hard core alcoholic which is clearly what she is.<br />I would still recommend it.  The disabled guy is really really good.<br />It's about how life is what you make of it or think of it.<br />How you look at your own fortune.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|Big mistake! Uninstalled it! Bought this after listening to different sounds on the free version (you will see with the rest of my original review how happy I WAS). What the heck is up with the silence every 60 seconds on the loop? How can you expect people to enjoy it? Are you going to fix this issue? If not this product is a rip off....big time!<br /><br />Original Review: I downloaded the lite version & I chose to purchase the full version in under 5 minutes! My brain really relies on sounds to sleep. This is perfect & it's the only one I've seen that has a box fan & this has 3! And on top of that you can layer the sounds. I'm truly amazed by the sound quality & it has 87 sounds to pick from. You can download just the ones you want or all of them. Very small amount of memory needed. If you have a favorite sound I bet this has it lol. This is a true \\"zone out your brain\\" helper!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|interesting and challenging.  I would reccommend this game to others. very good and this is enough to say about this game
0316044695|5.0|This was such a good book. Being from the Marines, I have a somewhat understating of what he went through from start to end. I'm not saying I can relate, but that I can understand and imagine how he felt. I think anyone with a ounce of a soul and compassion would enjoy this book. Military especially!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like the Bible app because it send scriptures daily and it read the scripture out loud for you.some word in the Bible are hard and its good to here them pronounced.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I thought this book started out a little slow, but it picked up.  Excellent murder mystery!  Can't wait to read the next book in this series.
B0029LHX1W|3.0|Although I enjoyed the book, I would recommend to anyone Olen Steinhauer's series set in a thinly disguised Soviet-bloc country.  He has a better feel for life inside the Communist bloc and writes better prose.  Smith is good, quite good, but I would submit that Steinhauer's work is more authentic.  It moves very slowly, but worth every minute.<br /><br />Smith's good; Steinhauer is better.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|Its a different take on the classic Match game. The different tiles come and go as you try to match one tile to another. Easy to understand but fun factor will vary from person to person. I will probably open a few times until an inevitable uninstall
B006QS07IK|4.0|After years of watching movies about Frankenstein I finally read the original book (published in 1818) by Mary Shelley.<br /><br />Wow, is it ever different from the movies.<br /><br />For starters Victor Von Frankenstein worked alone. He didn't have a lisping hunchback by the name of Igor helping him out. He worked in solitary while he was a student at the University of Ingolstadt.<br /><br />Secondly, there was no thunderstorm and no electrodes the night that he gave his creature life. There was no bolt of lighting. And although Victor Von Frankenstein keeps very mum about the methods that he used to animate dead flesh, he does make some cryptic allusions to an elixir of life.<br /><br />Thirdly there was no crowd scene where hordes of peasants storm the castle, brandishing pitchforks and torches.<br /><br />In addition Mary Shelley's creature itself is different in appearance from the creature in the movies. Mary Shelley's creature is eight feet tall, has long dark hair and moves much faster and much more nimble than any human. This is a HUGE contrast from the slow moving and awkward creature that they show in the movies.<br /><br />Perhaps the fifth thing that I noticed was that the creature (who calls himself Adam) learns how to speak and read and write (in French) and becomes very articulate. After he learns how to read he finds a number of books written in French (Paradise Lost by John Milton, a volume of Plutarch's Lives and the Sorrows of Young Werter by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) and he reads them again and again.<br /><br />After all this perhaps what struck me about the book is how the relationship between Victor Von Frankenstein and his creation are similar to the relationship between an absentee father and his abandoned child. Victor is repulsed by the physical appearance of the creature he created and runs from the room as soon as it rises up off the table. The creature wanders out of Victor's home and Victor neither knows nor cares if it survived.<br /><br />Not having any parents to guide \\"Adam\\" in his development he is left to fend for himself. Because of his hideous appearance, humans throw stones at him and chase him whenever he appears in public, he is thus forced to hide in the woods and live alone.<br /><br />\\"Adam\\" learns how to speak French by watching a family that live in a hovel near the edge of the woods and listening to their conversations. He grows to love this family and hopes someday to gain their acceptance. He goes into the forest to gather wood for them that they can use for their fireplace and leaves it at their front door. He works to improve his language skills so that he may better communicate with them when he finally meets them in person.<br /><br />But when he finally (after months of preparation) works up the courage, it all goes wrong. The French Family takes one look at him and decides because he is ugly that he MUST be a threat and they chase him out of their hovel.<br /><br />This of course makes him more and more bitter and makes him even less trusting of humans.<br /><br />Eventually he learns who gave him life and where his \\"Father\\" lives.<br /><br />Of course the reunion between abandoned child and absentee father is not good.r /><br />Not having any parents to guide \\"Adam\\" in his development he is left to fend for himself.

B006PTZNSY|5.0|I honestly think that is a wonderful sophomore album for Nicki Minaj. Many people complain that it is not rap. Can you really get mad for some diversity? I really love the fact that there is rap and pop. The music is wonderful, its the only thing I been listening to since it came out. I really do look forward to the videos and the junior album. I have loved her music since she came out.
B0062HS03O|4.0|Lady Gaga is both tremenously talented and very smart in building and delivering this concert. One note: As stated on the packaging \\"Parental Advisory. Explicit Content\\". For LG fans that are familiar with her live performances, no problem - go for the DVD in Blu Ray. For others, there's probably something to offend everyone.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I surely wasn't looking for a fairy tale ending. In fact, I was HOPING it wouldn't be an asinine fairy tale ending, and it wasn't ~ so that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is as follows:<br /><br />For the first two books and about 99.999% of the last book, we are treated to Katniss's every waking (and dreaming) thought in great, vivid detail. There is never any room for guesswork, and you always know where Katniss's is coming from; why she makes the decisions she does; why her actions were as they were; how she feels about things after they have transpired.  Then, all of a sudden, at the tail end of the last book, all that disappears. It just completely drops away and the epilogue fast forwards fifteen years with a \\"barely there\\" explanation of how things became what they are in those last fifteen years.  There is not one single iota of decent writing explaining  Katniss's evolution beyond the Hunger Games.  Many readers explain this as the way soldiers are when they come back from war:  they aren't living their lives, they just exist.  That may be true for a vast majority of soldiers, but then they end up like Haymitch who just exists with endless bottles of booze. But somehow, Katniss ended up with a partner and a family. You don't just exist through having a relationship (and sex) with one out of the only two men you've ever loved; you don't just exist through two pregnancies; you don't just exist through two births.  We know that Katniss's was wary of leading the life she has come to live, but that's the only hint of the once complicated, complex, passionate girl we are given. For all other intents and purposes, Katniss's goes from interesting girl warrior to boring, middle aged soccer mom.<br /><br />Who Katniss's ended up with between Gale and Peeta wasn't an issue for me. I knew in the first sentence of the second book who she would end up with and why. And that made sense to me. But all the colorful, flavorful, deep, heartfelt explanations in Katniss's voice that had previously brought the reader INTO the story vanished into thin air. So, in the end, the reader has absolutely no investment whatsoever in Katniss's as an adult, or her life, her children's lives, her partner's life, or the life they have together.<br /><br />The first two books and the entire third book are spent with Katniss's from the time she is sixteen until she is seventeen.  Then the Epilogue jumps ahead fifteen years and spends but a couple pages on Katniss's current life and the things that lead up to it. Not only do you not \\"know\\" Katniss's anymore, but you also don't give a crap because any emotions or interest you had invested in her character disappear right along with the author's ability to write.<br /><br />It's almost as if the author got bored with the story and just decided to hurry up and tie off the few loose ends in all of about ten minutes time. Or, as if the manuscript's drop dead due date was the next morning, so she just dropped in a few words and called it a day with the \\"Epilogue\\" so that the publishers wouldn't take back the money they paid her for the third installment.<br /><br />For me, the \\"way\\" things ended was fine ~ I just would have liked to have traveled to the end with Katniss's the way we traveled through the rest of her life: in her head, with all her thoughts, good, bad, or otherwise.
B001JNNE64|5.0|Product arrived in the promised time frame.  Classic film with a fun take on Mozart's life, trials, tribulations, and successes.

B004KZDV8E|5.0|For just a couple more dollars over the i3-2100, the i3-2120 gives you 200 MHz more; I think that's worth it. Fast dual-core processor, and I can't really tell the difference between this and my quad-core i5-2500K on regular Internet browsing and word processing tasks. Impressively quick and stock CPU cooler is up to the task at keeping temps low. Not much overclocking possible, however.
0345803485|4.0|Girl meets boy. Girl falls in love with boy. Boy has secret dungeon sex room! This was different to anything I've ever read and I loved it.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|Forget the sappy world of Twilight and step into the paranormal fantasy world of The Forever Girl.  Involving a complicated, involved love story between Sophia and Charles, you get to unearth the skeletons hiding in Sophia's closet and discover a twisted world of murder.  Truly Charles sex-appeal is apparent making the love story attractive yet enticing.  I will say there are a few adult scenes, however, they are tasteful, yet nothing too embarrassing.  Moreover, you will be shocked and surprised with the conclusion involving Ivory.  Finally a story with a strong female character that truly gets to play the role of heroine and save the ones she truly cares and loves! Not to mention you get a glimpse into the world and rituals of wiccans, debunking the stereotype, yet involving the perfect, interesting world of fantasy.  True dark magic is used for the story, yet, the description and research was perfectly planned and executed.  Truly the story was well paced, supplying excellent amounts of background information along with supporting characters to hinder and aid the quest.  If this sounds interesting, I guarantee you will enjoy this urban fantasy.  I am quite intrigued with the author, and if you enjoyed this one, you may like [[ASIN:0441019331 Dead Until Dark  (Sookie Stackhouse, Book 1)]].

B0073XORCY|4.0|For years Ian Anderson has proclaimed that he is not Jethro Tull, he's just a guy in a band. Obviously most of us, including IA, are aware that the band Jethro Tull has been Ian Anderson and a revolving door of ever changing musicians playing with him. It started right after the first album \\"This Was\\" and the departure of Mick Abrahams. After \\"Benefit\\" it was, adios Glenn Cornick, after \\"Aqualung\\" it was, so long Clive Bunker and so on. With or without them, or any of the other musicians that have come and gone, there was always the band Jethro Tull. Without Ian Anderson though, the party's over. He's been writing, singing and playing the music for over 40 years.<br />  So why is everyone wasting their time worrying about what this CD or the band playing it is called? Ian Anderson has never stopped writing new music, and at 60 something, he's given us another strong CD of new music. Just say \\"Thank you\\" and enjoy it, because there's a lot to enjoy on TAAB2.<br />  And now I'm just looking forward to enjoying the \\"Thick as a Brick 1 & 2\\" concert. Thank you Ian.
0375869026|5.0|I have always started my 8.5 year old daughter off with a new book by reading the first pages until there is a good part and then hand it over to her. With this book however, I didn't want to stop either. She and I have enjoyed reading Wonder together before bed each night. This book has the perfect mix of humor (my daughter has even read passages to other family members, and laughs all over again as she tells it) and seriousness. This boy is dealing with his facial deformities as a preteen AND at a new school. He is a hero that any child can look up to.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'll agree that exiting the app is a bit different. but its not difficult. the options trick works for me and its worth it for the game. very fun and addictive. more often than not I get bored with game apps quickly but this ones a keeper.
0486407217|3.0|I'm disappointed with this book. It's nice to look at, but isn't helpful if you actually want to make an outfit. There are basically no instructions on how to assemble the outfits, other than numbers on the pattern to match up. The book doesn't even give a picture of the back of the outfits.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I actually loved this game until I logged on today and my energy was gone and all my buildings,animals, and crops have 148 hour times on them!! Seriously?? It must be a glitch or something but either way I am not going to play if it is not fixed. I also agree with other reviews the energy goes too quickly any I would not pay real money to play. I would have payed a one time fee initially. If my game doesn't fix I will uninstall because I am not starting over with the excessive wait time!

0439023521|5.0|The hunger games is a great shock filled novel about a girl named katniss everdeen. She lives in the contry of panem. Every year the anual hunger games are held to remind the contry of district 13 which the capitol destroyed. Katniss is pulled to go fight the death in the arena. Along the way she meets friends and enimies and gets almost killed quie a few times and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed it a lot. I recomend it to anyone who can handle a little blood and to people who have free time because its hard to put down. So to sum it up its pretty darn good.
0345529057|5.0|Nice way to obtain the first 4 books of this series.  Comes in a protective box, which makes it easier to store them afterwards.  Been reading them for a while, and almost no sign of tear.
B006XIR9KM|3.0|This is a well done game and a nice take on the memory game. It gives you the illusion of a set back gameplay with the soothing music and all.  But the twist with the moving and disappearing tiles makes you try to go fast. Very solid game, but not sure if the price is acceptable.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|This game is fun, unlike reading lame reviews from users that consider themselves comedians. His attempt at wit has become pathetic.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Maybe I'm a pariah in the US, but for many years now I've found that I just don't care about most of the movies that have come out in in the last decade or so (The Matrix series and Star Wars notwithstanding). I'm proud to say Wall-E is one of the exceptions. Obviously geared primarily towards kids, Pixar and Disney have managed to throw enough adult-themed content into the movie to make it interesting.<br /><br />A portion of the movie contains almost zero dialogue, and the story between Wall-E and Eva is told primarily through physical humor and a variety of beeps and electronic sounds. What's more amazing is that it's done in a way you can tell exactly what they are communicating without them needing to use language to do so. A feat that few recent movies can boast of, even WITH the use of language.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, you need to. Regardless of whether you pay $2 to rent it, or $20 to buy it, it's worth it.
B003LXSY60|5.0|I am a music lover who can't even drive to the store without my music. I've not listened to much of the music produced in the last ten years or so because there was nothing that caught my ear. Actually, I've not given any of the more current music any opportunity to catch my ear. I'm sure I'm not alone with this mentality. The Black Keys have totally proved me wrong! How many times do you purchase an album and enjoy every song you bought? I previewed each song on Amazon before deciding to buy it and based my decision to on those short segments of music. It was a good choice---<br />this album is -like the other Black Keys albums I've bought-a great combination of blues-rock-alt music that I never even suspected was still available. It's great--try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.
B007B8GI28|5.0|I don't know what to say except I bought this episode through Amazon's digital library and it was awesome.  The show is usually available the day after the original airing, if not sooner, and it's a great way to keep with up with Walking Dead since I refuse to pay for cable.
B0000DZ3HM|5.0|This is simply jazz history.  Admittedly biased for the Blue Note label I still feel that every jazz lover needs this in the DVD rack.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|kindle for Android is really great.  I have it on my phone and I don't have to take my tablet with me all the time.  Just grab my phone and go.  Love it
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like classic solitaire, you will love this one.  Lots of settings so you can customize the game.  It has ads but you can skip those.
B006Q6MOCY|4.0|This album along with contemporaries \\"Forever Changes\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" has always held a very special place in my heart.  These albums like true classics never get old and even listening to them so many times over so many years these albums always manage to reach me.  The sad thing about \\"Pet Sounds\\" though is that unlike the other albums mentioned above which have been mixed well and have sounded really good post remastering this album has at best an average quality level of mixing which makes it really difficult to get a very good sounding version of \\"Pet Sounds\\" despite numerous attempts at trying to get this album to achieve its sonic potential.  If only George Martin produced/mixed this album!  I've owned many versions of this and prior to this release the best sounding version I've heard was an old made in Holland stereo mix version which I have since sold and regretted as I've yet to find \\"Trombone Dixie\\" anywhere else on a single cd version of the whole album as a bonus track like that version did.<br /><br />I don't have an SACD player and so I may update this later once I spin it on my friend's player soon but even on a standard cd player this version while is very good with respect to previous releases given the original mix isn't the best sounding when compared with restored/remastered releases of it contemporaries mentioned above.  The cardboard gatefold packaging is very nice though and would interest collectors of mlps releases although strictly speaking this is not a true replica of the original vinyl sleeve.  Also included is a 20 page colour booklet with all the lyrics and a Mark Linett essay.<br /><br />Mofi did the best that they could with the material that they had to work with but this is certainly not a reference-quality audio experience.  In short, this release may just be the best version of the album that is currently out there but it is certainly not the best sounding mofi release.<br /><br />Still recommended!
0345803485|5.0|Great story, equal parts sweet and spicy. Don't let the recent media reviews fool you. This is a great trilogy and I am so sad to have finished them. Could not put them down. Hint, reading on the kindle is perfect with the built-in dictionary - she uses an advanced vocabulary. Just go with it and you'll really enjoy it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is well worth the price. Whether you're looking for an app to kill time or a deep puzzle experience, Quell is the game for you. I'm not normally a huge puzzle game fan, but I got Quell as the FAotD and have been hooked since.
0439023521|2.0|I read this whole tril and kept hoping for Gale.  I found this story so depressing.  it wasnt my kind of read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is an awesome game so you should play it and rate it five stars because you will like it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were the best I've read in a long time! I never wanted to put the book away but kept on reading. Too bad I finished the book.
1439127700|5.0|Anyone - Democrat or Republican - with an interest in the workings of the Presidency will find this a fascinating read. Sides of past presidents will be revealed that you hadn't known existed. It's an equally-interesting book when you take into account that even what is written about only scratches the surface, as ex-Presidents will only reveal so much.<br />I prefer not to list certain portions of a book like this that I really liked, as I know how much I like to avoid seeing even trivial \\"spoilers\\" - but rest assured, this is an account saturated with highly educational information.
B006XIR9KM|2.0|greetings fellow amazonians I was waiting for the bus today when I downloaded doubletake. I thought it would let you take pictures of twins and then see them naked. unfortunately I have tried it on three sets of twins and it only works for the men. please update this so I can use this on women too I am planning on going to see the original doublemint twins this weekend and would like to use it on them.
B0073XORCY|4.0|I'm not going to ramble on about the album.  I was a huge Tull fan in the seventies and saw them at the Garden whenever they came into town.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear Ian's voice sounding the same.  I think the album is GREAT!  I loved it after listening to it once and have listened everyday since.  He is a master, remains a master and so glad he came out with this.  Will see him at the Beacon Theatre in October.  The band he put together to record the album sounds as good as the original.  Martin was missed of course.  Get the album, relax and listen.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book. Not as bizarre as his latest books. More like his first books, like 'The Stand\\" and 'The Dead Zone\\". Enjoyed
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game is a great strategy game.  My only problem is that it is so difficult to get gold coins, once this problem is solved this game will be perfect.
B006XIR9KM|5.0|It's worth downloading to see if you like it. I don't like how the tiles move around on their own because I have a tough enough time remembering where they were to begin with, but I'm sure a lot of people will love the extra challenge. The game works well, and exits properly. It's definitely worth checking out!
B007VGXS8M|5.0|where's Waldo is an awesome game...I can finally play it on my kindle... it was a terrific game... I recommend that u should get this game...I'm supposed to write something down but bye
0307474259|4.0|This book was recommended by others and lives up to most expectations.  Understanding the mechanisms of getting fat is the first step of slimming down.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I ordered this DVD, so I could do structured exercise at home between my days at the gym.  This DVD is, actually, made to be used once a day for 30 days; hence, the 30 day shred.  I work-out 2 hours per day (cardio and weights), 3 days per week, and having done so for 18 months, I consider myself in relatively good shape.  Honestly, Jillian's Level 1 on this DVD kicked my ass!  She has two \\"assistants\\" - one for high intensity and one for low intensity - I had to do the low intensity one at first.  What a great work-out in just 25 minutes.  You do need weights and a mat, so be prepared. This is no joke.  If you want a great work-out (regardless of your fitness level), this is definitely the DVD for you!
B005FITIIC|4.0|This is a great Wall Street film but very different than the famous Michael Douglas film of the 80s. The Douglas films (the original \\"Wall Street\\" and the sequel \\"Money Never Sleeps\\") both felt much more like a typical movie thriller with a much higher degree of movie unrealism. \\"Margin Call\\" feels much more gritty and real. The good thing about the movie is that it pretty much just tells the story of a hypothetical investment bank (Lehman? Bear?) at the start of the financial meltdown without a lot of political bluster. I thought the movie could have done a little better job of explaining the underlying mortgage-backed securities that precipitated the mess. I have a layman's working understanding of the underlying securities, but some viewers may not have followed the details of the crisis in actual news reports. If you like financial movies, I definitely recommend that you see this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app.  helps me remember everything and the older I get the more I need it.  love that its on Pc, kindle and phone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun and challenging! It's great having the option to show hints if you get really stuck on a level.
B0073XORCY|4.0|I notice reviewers saying this is a Jethro Tull album. It isn't. The title clearly states 'Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson'. I put this in the same pile as all his solo albums, which i happen to enjoy. I find this album start to finish to be quite pleasant, and take it for what it is, another IA solo album, cashing in on TAAB anniversary. Yes, i own all IA and JTs music, and will keep buying it... what can I say other than the man knows how to make a buck. i put it between 3 and 4 stars, and rate it better the the last full tull album, J-Tull.Com (i don't count the xmas album as a full album.  I also rate it about the same as Calliandra's Shade, but not quite as good as SLoB.  It has some nice standout tracks (banker bets is one that comes to mind).  I also enjoy that the album starts where TAAB1 ends and ends where TAAB1 begins.  Florian (new guitar player) does a good job of puting hints of Barre's work, as well as playing something crafted from his own style.  It also contains IA's commentary on religion, which has grown, for me, a little tiresome.  Some new stuff, healthy dose of the old stuff, and all in all a good album in 2012.
B002JM1VJG|1.0|Pirated material. 100% boot leg quality
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app! It has every biblical version that I need. Easy to use and easy to perform searches. Great to have on Kindle Fire.
0061537969|5.0|I can't remember the last time I described a book as beautiful, but this was.<br />It was such a fresh and touching look at love and perseverance. This book has such a underlying spiritual quality that makes you completely connect with the story on a deeper level. You feel Enzo's love of his family. You understand his desire to have some control over his existence but ultimately he accepts what he cannot control. He finds ability to live in the present and love eternally.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|AWESOME app! Very fun. Just like Mario and good for passing the time. I've had no problems and it's really fun, graphics and all. Overall,  this is a great app!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read all 3 books, just hoping she would sink her teeth into something meaty and make it suspenseful, and each time I thought she was going to, it was over as quickly as the topic started!  I read them, and I knew where she was going to end up, but hoping I was wrong.  Nope!  She was predictable!  I don't see the reason for all the hype.  Yes, I enjoyed how the first book started off, but even by the end of the first book, she was getting repetitive and the second was boring but I had to know at that point if she would improve on the third.  She did not, you could see it coming a mile away.  I hope the movie writers do it more justice!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I loved this movie with Richard Gere, it is sad at the end when the dog dies from old age waiting for his owner to come back home who had died!
B0071WQ7WU|1.0|Just typical late 90's style nicklepop rock/theroy of a nicklepop rock band with the exact same crap vocal style as the two overrated hack bands listed.  This could have easily been a nicklepop album.  Been done, still sucks nothing new or worth listening too...if you love Nickleback or theroy of a nIceback the you will automatically love this cause it's copy and paste and sucks just as hard to anyone who listens a to any good non turd polished music at all that actually requires talent to create.
B007HNFREW|5.0|I had not seen any of these episodes before, so I was quite pleased with the quality of the episodes, and how they stay fairly true to the books.  Highly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an okay app but it needs better controls. I would pike to see different gaames. the selection is good but theyre all the same.
0002247399|1.0|I doubt if this book would have helped pass the time while guarding the wall.  Martin should rethink the urging he received to expand on the dragons and Daenery.  I want a book 6 but hope that it will read more like the earlier ones.
B001ILFUDC|1.0|\\"Pinocchio\\" wasn't my uber-favorite Disney movie when I was little. I liked it, but I was not into it as much as I was \\"The Lion King\\" from 1994. Back in 2009, when I heard it was going to be released on a \\"Special Edition\\" DVD, I was happy and wanted to get it, mainly because I wanted to see it again and relive my younger childhood. This review is not on the movie itself. \\"Pinocchio\\" is one of Disney's best works and made it what it is today. It is now my favorite movie and I have seen it many times. This review is on its somewhat mediocre \\"70th Anniversary Platinum Edition.\\"<br /><br />I must admit, the picture and restoration look a little bright, but it looks the same when the movie was released to VHS in the '90's. While the restoration looks okay, it's not spectacular.<br /><br />Now, on to the special features:<br /><br />On Disc 1, you won't find any games to play, except a trivia game called, \\"Pinocchio's Matter of Facts.\\" This might sound fun, but the one disappointment that comes out of this, is that it can only be played during the film. Won't it get distracting trying to play this game when you're trying to watch the movie? The second good thing in this disc is the \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" music video. That's about it.<br /><br />As for Disc 2, its quality and content is as bland as the first one, with some exceptions, but it's still not good enough. There is only one game on this disc, an interactive jigsaw puzzle game, narrated by Jiminy Cricket himself. While being entertaining, at least, it just shows pictures of the movie that \\"magically\\" turn into video clips. There is nothing exciting, special or unique about it.<br /><br />Although, this two disc set has its exceptions, like the movie, music video, etc., it's not that interesting at all. It's almost lacking in content for kids and adults, and most of it is bland and boring. If you want to see \\"Pinocchio\\" again for the first time in years since you were little, get this set JUST to see the movie. All I have to say is, Disney, keep trying. This \\"Platinum Edition\\" of my favorite movie is zero to none.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|I love Waldo I couldn't find any of the books and now look I can play where's Waldo all the time!

B004SEUJYG|1.0|I hope everybody noticed in the product details that this has a \\"Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1\\" So I hope you don't think just because it's a \\"Blu-Ray\\" that it would be Wide screen.
1401232590|5.0|If this isn't one of the best Batman stories ever told, it's at least one of my favorites. As a huge Batman fan, I decided to pick this up due to hearing about it and it getting good reviews. I definitely was very happy and satisfied with it after reading it. I couldn't put it down, and it has definitely transformed me into an even bigger fan of Batman and reading his stories, than I ever was before.<br /><br />Without any spoilers, it tells a great suspenseful story, where Batman's detective skills and emotions are put to the test. It features many classic villains, and will make it hard for you to put down. It features a great art style, and it's just a great story altogether.<br /><br />I can't recommend this enough. If you have to have 1 Batman book in your collection, make it this one in my opinion. The sequel to this book is Dark Victory, and I definitely recommend you pick that one up as well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love the animations! Love the characters! Love the mini games! This game is a lot of fun and so very entertaining! Scrat's a hoot!!
B002M5E2DW|1.0|The subject matter of the book may be great for some but it is a bad read and for that reason i set it aside and have not gotten past the first quarter of it. I kept waiting for something more than a testimonial, and nothing. Just not my cup of tea...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love the characters.they make me smile. The game is interesting and fresh. The graphics are clear and bright. Love it!!
B004ZNB12O|4.0|If you're an avid Pink Floyd fan, this compilation probably isn't for you. This is definitly for the casual fan. Its pretty much a collection of the songs you'll hear on the radio. It has all of my favorites. Unfortunitly nothing from Animals. All Its also great for someone on a budget. I paid $10 for my copy at Wal-Mart!

B0071WQ7WU|2.0|THEY TOOK A LONG BREAK SINCE 2008, AND THIS IS WHAT THEY COME UP WITH AFTER 4 YEARS???  I LISTENED THROUGH THE WHOLE ALBUM, AND (BULLY) WAS THE ONLY SONG THAT STOOD OUT COMPARED TO THE MANY THAT WERE GREAT ON THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS.  I LOVE THIS BAND FOR THEIR LAST 3 ALBUMS, BUT THIS ALBUM PRETTY MUCH IS RUN OF THE MILL CRAP... I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS ALBUM IS JUST A FLUKE AND THEY GO BACK TO BASICS...
B003X5UFWW|5.0|I was transported into the Chinese culture and given a taste of a wonderful new world as it was drug into WWII by the Japanese.  More than a martial arts film, this was a compelling story of a great man enduring the most difficult of times.  Throughout the movie, the strong characters reminded me just how shallow most American films can be.<br /><br />A ballanced leader that held himself to a high standard.  Seems like a leadership lesson especially relevant as we start our campaign season.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I had trouble downloading book to kindle and it loaded without bookcover . There are a number of words in the download version that have this \\"#%$^&*(()*%##@\\" instead of letters, but as it is free I will live with it.
0345803485|2.0|So, I am 50% of the way through the first book. I find it to be an OK read, but I just finished reading the Twilight Series before starting this and I can't help but be annoyed with all the similarities! James could have at least changed the setting from Washington to California or some place. There was also a part where Ana's mom can't make her graduation bc her new husband is hurt....Seriously? I think I just read that same thing in Twilight! Don't even get me started on how Bella and Ana are the exact same person. What happened to originality?

B007JRU2UK|1.0|I watched this move all a way to the end just to see how bad it could get, and sure enough it was getting worse by a minute. If these kids are a new generation, I suggest to young couple not to have any kids at all, unless isolate them from this kind of movies or books. As far as for parents who have great kids, don't let them watch it, they might get a wrong idea. The best actress was the older daughter, she has a great future in acting. I was hoping that at the end of the movie the lover would walk into the room and George's wife gets well. Then I would have given 2 stars. If I were George Cloney, I would pass on this role and get some voice over for Disney movies, if he wants to make some money.
B00371QQ8Y|5.0|When I first saw the Blu-ray version of this film I was, at first, taken somewhat aback by the amount of grain in some of the early shots.  When I compared it  with the DVD, the grain was still there but much less defined.  Then I chose to ignore it, turned off the lights and started the film.  I was soon swept up into it due to the starkness of the photography, the finely written screenplay and the superb cast.  Like \\"Syriana,\\" it is a  singularly depressing film, but its extraordinary craftsmanship and complexity will draw you in to repeat viewings.
B000HKYA1I|5.0|Excellent service.  This movie arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  I watched it immediately.  Thanks for providing it at such a good price and for sending it so promptly.
B002RHL8DC|5.0|Stargate Universe is \\"the thinking man's\\" Stargate series. It's well written, well acted, and beautifully though terrifyingly rendered on the screen. Gone are the silly Egyptian-inspired dudes in the tacky costumes talking about Tokras, and in their place, a desperate struggle for survival aboard a huge ancient intergalactic spaceship.If you liked the \\"new\\" Battlestar Galactica series, to which this series owes a bit for its inspiration, you'll love this one.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Got it for the boyfriend and he's enjoying it very much.  Likes that the Kindle (his gift to me) gets to be used for himself also.
1594200440|1.0|It must be really something wrong with my sense of humour not to find amusing a story about an old, senile man crawling naked, soiling his pants or about hunger and repressions that Ukrainians suffered from during the war. Comedy novel? For crying out loud!

Thankfully we were right as she absolutely loved this plush toy.  The toy is about the size of your normal Ty Beanie Baby products, which is perfect for her to throw in her backpack or purse and lug around the house or out on trips.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Ok, this book is not for someone who wants a perfect love story. It is raw and sometimes cruel. The first half of the book I LOVED! I connected with Abby and Travis right from the start. When I was half way through the book I thought that it could honestly end there and I would be happy, but that was far from the end. The description that I read about Abby losing a bet and having to stay with Travis for a month was only a tiny itty bitty piece of the story. Travis is co dependant when it comes to Abby, as she is the only girl he has ever loved. He is violent towards other guys who are looking at Abby. The breakup was horrible. I could feel both of their pain! The story did have a happy ending, which they both deserved! I did enjoy the book, it was worth the $2.99 I paid!
0545259096|4.0|Maggie Stiefvater's tales of winter werewolves have always been far more striking and poetic than any other werewolf books I can think of. And she brings the story of Grace and Sam to a close in \\"Forever,\\" a hauntingly bittersweet, sumptuously-written coming-of-age tale with a somewhat flawed finale.<br /><br />Spring has returned Grace to her human form, but she's still unstable -- she keeps turning back into a wolf and running into the woods. Sam has spent the whole winter waiting for her, despite the people of Mercy Falls thinking he's a budding serial killer. And Cole is hotly pursuing a cure for lycanthropy, using himself as a guinea pig.<br /><br />However, Sam and Grace's idyllic reunion is ruined by another death -- another girl is found savaged by a wolf (pretty obviously Shelby). Isabel's father arranges for the wolves to be exterminated (with HELICOPTERS), leaving the teens only a few days to lead the wolves to safety. Otherwise, Grace may be among the dead.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater is one of the rare young-adult authors who has lyrical, hauntingly lovely writing. Fragmented thoughts arrange themselves into minimalist poems, and mundane situations take on the delicate crystalline quality of a romantic dream (\\"it was just me, broken into pieces, slivered like glass, made into something new\\").<br /><br />\\"Forever\\" centers on three important subplots -- the need to save the wolf pack from Isabel's revenge-obsessed father, the quest for a lycanthropy cure (especially for Cole), and the teenagers shedding their childhood problems as they prepare to set out into adulthood. The story drifts along between these three subplots, with some bloody, tightly-paced action scenes (like the grand finale) woven in.<br /><br />And her characters are just as brilliant as her writing -- four troubled teenagers, who are breaking away from their pasts and their weird parents. Grace and Sam settle into an idyllic little world of their own, but are haunted by the hostility towards Sam and Grace's feelings about her parents. And Stiefvater spends a lot of time focusing on Cole and Isabel's tumultuous relationship, as Cole goes all brilliant mad scientist.<br /><br />One problem: the ending is rushed. Isabel, Cole and Grace take dramatic actions that seem like they should have massive consequences... but they don't. At all. Shouldn't Isabel's dad be having a rage-induced stroke or something?<br /><br />The payoff feels rushed and a little incomplete, but otherwise \\"Forever\\" is a striking, romantic little finale for Stiefvater's brilliant trilogy. This is everything \\"Twilight\\" failed to be.wards Sam and Grace's feelings about her parents.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Although I loved all of the plots twists unlike the other books it seemed predictable. I felt as if I knew drogon would come for Dany maybe not at that time but eventually. I enjoyed Cersi being cruly punished I even laughed at her, but someparts just angered me. For example when jaime saw breinne I was hoping for more just to be left with nothing. I would give more critisisim but, you have to factor in the fact that other books are far worse and have higher ratings while GRRM is an exeptional writer who set his own bar too high.

B005EGXTEE|2.0|Although an interesting premise, the plot fails to fulfill its potential.  Characterisation is poor.  Some of the interesting minor characters - the Avox, for example - are not developed at all and the motivations of the action are dealt with in the most trite way.

B007K3JCAE|3.0|Great potential for real drama and emotion with the death of Sherlock's dear friend and love interest. Never gets there!  Robert Downey is too busy impressing himself. In this movie, the actor gets in the way of the character. We want to know more of Holmes- a tall order to be sure, but this movie is more of a mindless romp in the cerebrum of Mr. Downey. Even the relationship of Sherlock with Mr. Watson seems tedious.The good doctor isn't just a straight man for Sherlock to zing with one liners. Reminded me more of Abbot and Costello. One last comment- these are two GREAT actors and the Sherlock Holmes fans (at least me) are crying out, \\"Make one more movie and do it right! We believe in you!\\". Create something you are really proud of!

0553386794|4.0|A long journey with no end in sight. I'll try to avoid much plot beyond was it needed to be mentioned and focus more on the strengths and failings of each book.<br /><br />The first of a planned trilogy turned two trilogies turned to seven, possibly eight books, A Game of Thrones begins as one story but ends somewhere else entirely. Following the usurping of the \\"mad king\\" King Robert Baratheon has sits upon the Iron Throne uncomfortably (as if there was any other way to sit upon a seat made entirely of swords melted together) caring more to hunt, whore and drink than rule. His wife, unbeknown to him, has birthed three children with her own brother and claimed them as Robert's. When his Hand (either the Hand speaks with the voice of the King, or, the King s***s and the Hand wipes) dies suddenly he heads north to Winterfell to induct his childhood friend and partner in rebellion, Neddard Stark to take the position.<br /><br />Soon the Stark family is divided, Ned's Bastard is sent to The Wall, a massive 700 foot high block of ice that damns the north from the rest of Westeros, as his wife will not have him around without Ned and he can't take him with to court. The two youngest children stay behind while Ned takes his eldest son and two daughters (the older of whom is to marry Robert's heir, Joffery) to Kings Landing to rule.<br /><br />Soon it is obvious that Robert's wife Cerci has plotted to kill Robert, take Ned stark, claim the thrown for her incest born son and rule as Queen until he comes of age. This is when the story takes flight.<br /><br />Though it seems to start as a tale of \\"winter coming\\" (winter being less a season and more like a minor ice-age that hits every other generation or so and my last for years or decades) it quickly turns into a power struggle pulling all the lands off all the world in.<br /><br />We also meet Danny, the youngest daughter of the \\"Mad King\\" whose brother attempts to sell her as a wife to gain an army of horse lords to take back the Iron Throne. This ends poorly for the conceded fool, but Danny learns she has the true blood-of-the-dragons in her, she cannot be burned by fire and by the end of the book she has hatched three baby dragons from believed fossilized eggs.<br /><br />Elsewhere Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis each prepare to claim the throne as word of Joffery's bastard status is spread, as well Robb Stark, the eldest son calls his father's bannermen to lead an assault against the Lannisters. Which leads us to the next novel.<br /><br />In A Clash of Kings, Martin tells the story of the war of the seven kingdoms. It seems every lord wants to proclaim himself king (new ones pop up every day, it is noted) and they are both marching on Kings Landing, and against each other.<br /><br />It's here that one of the strongest characters, Tyrion Lannister, twins Cerci and Jamie's younger sibling, a dwarf despised by his family and hated by his father for \\"killing\\" his mother when he came into the world. Tyrion is well read and educated and early on unaware of the incest between his twin siblings. After being accused in the first book of trying to kill one of the Stark sons, Tyrion has bought his way home with a sellsword and wildlings under his employ and upon finding his father in battle against Robb, is sent to Kings Landing to be Hand to Joffery. Here we see how smart Tyrion is as he outwits both his sister and Stannis at every turn and ultimately saves them all from invasion and secures Joffery's throne a bit longer.<br /><br />Unlike Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings tells a less character driven story. Many new characters and locations are introduced, which, on first reading can be confusing. Though the first book would have you think the Starks are the focus of these books, you find out fast that anyone can die and there's no clear option for who the reader should perceive as good or bad, or even the better of all other options. As well it seems like Danny has been left with little to do but wonder the dessert, plot revenge, raise her dragons and suffer.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords may easily be the best book of the series. Bracing, swift and epic (one of the longest of the series at over 1000 pages) it focuses almost squarely on the central characters, advances the plot lines in a satisfying manner and sweeps you into the one real page turning of the series.<br /><br />Sansa Stark has been un-betrothed to the bastard king Joffery, who is to marry of all people, Renly's widow (a supposed 16 yr old virgin widow.) However, Sansa is swiftly and forcibly (for both) wed to Tyrion the imp, no with half a nose and a full face scar from battle. Tyrion has never seemed to have it out for the Starks like his Sister and Father and is actually as kind to the stiff and horrified Sansa (not quite 13 years old) until they are both accused of murder. Sansa his whisked away by her Aunts new husband and assumes the role of his bastard daughter to hide. Tyrion is locked up and condemned.<br /><br />Meanwhile Robb Stark learns a hard lesson about breaking vows and he and his mother suffer dearly. Arya, the youngest sister has been captured for ransom, Jon Snow lives and returns from behind the wall with the wildings only to be stuck trying not to take sides in the war as Stannis comes to the aid of the wall and demands to be treated like King even though he's yet to claim the throne. Danny buys 8000 slave warriors trading one of her dragons, then turns them on there masters, sacks the city and heads out to build her army and free slaves on her way to Kings Landing to take back the throne.<br /><br />Which all leads to the low-point of the series, A Feast for Crows... exactly what we, the readers, may feel we got. Not to say that it's all bad, just a poor choice in publishing. Crows is actually only half of the novel, the other half is the first half of A Dance with Dragons. Confused? Due to length issues Martin took have the character chapters and put them in Feast and saved the other half of the chapters for Dance, but didn't publish them together. Instead he doubled the length of Dance over five years, having the events of that novel and Feast meet in the middle and then run congruent again for the second half.<br /><br />The result is Feast is almost entirely the story of Kings Landing and the Lannisters with a few chapters on Greyjoy's and Arya and little else. Then in Dance you get the same time frame, but every-one elses stories. Some of it is not only redundant information including sections of chapters reprinted verbatim. In one case a character you know dies in Feast, has several chapters in Dance as the congruent story lines would have him still alive at the early points in the book.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones (could be titled La Morte D'Eddard) is a strong opening novel about the misfortunes that befall the Stark family which sets up the great war which is the framing for the other books to come.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings: An epic but often impersonal war story saved by the tales of Tyrion Lannister as he serves as Hand to the King and chief outwiter of his wicked sister, Cerci. Many new characters and locations can make the book a bit hard to follow but the set-up brings us...<br /><br />A Storm of Swords: The series high point, epic and moving, it fleshes out characters in events in a meaningful way and draws the reader into a real page-turner.<br /><br />At this point there is clear divide in the structure and writing.

Sounds like country pop rock at its worst or perhaps.. It's best if you like that genre, I'll use the track selector to skip over those. Considering the many good tracks and the few country pop rock tracks I'll give the Slipstream album three stars.

0345528581|4.0|I got a library copy after reading many of the reviews and I was intrigued.  I am 63 and have always worked to maintain fitness but have never used a gym to that end.  It's always been just running and calisthenics along with manual labor on home projects.  My repertoire of calisthenics was quite limited-mostly just push-ups and crunches and some stretching exercises.  That's worked quite well; I have broad shoulders, strong arms and a trim build.  I can still run (slowly) six miles.  Upon examining the 125 exercises I was very surprised to see just how readily they can be performed nearly anywhere and more importantly, how inclusive they were in covering the body's muscle groups.  I also found the clearly-labelled photos of the muscle groups to be very helpful.  I plan to begin slowly incorporating many of the exercises into my day and it will be easy to do.  He's right; it doesn't have to take much time.  I only do my push-ups every other day or so; four sets of 15 push-ups with 30 seconds rest between them, just a few minutes and they can be done nearly anywhere.  Having said that, I am quite skeptical of his down-playing of aerobic exercise.  I believe I'm living proof that my running is what's responsible for my low heart rate, excellent blood pressure, and my physician chuckling before he showed me the numbers from my blood analysis, saying, \\"this won't take long; it's all good.\\"  The few times I trained for a marathon my weight dropped so much that my clothes were hanging on me--and my weight had already been at a good level.  I did watch my eating more carefully but mainly just cut out things like large bowls of ice cream.  The runners I associate with and observe are for the most part quite slim, so I have to just shake my head at his claim.  But, here's my outlook:  his exercises only require some time; there are no machines or diets or supplements he's trying to sell.  If I find that I am losing weight as well as building strength and flexibility, then I'll just have to rearrange my mental map of the world a bit, and will have learned something new--always a welcome gift.

1402726678|5.0|This is my review of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. This mystery/thriller does a good job of keeping you on track of the big picture. The whole story starts with an injury of a little girl and a witness who saw the suspect complete the crime. This crime was important because the little girl was not only injured but terrified of what she saw.<br /><br />The details of the book were good. I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the gruesome Mr. Hyde. I could really tell how evil and mean looking he was. Mr. Hyde seemed to be rude and idiotic and would hurt anyone in his way. You could tell this by the part of the story where he runs in to the little girl and steps on her and doesn't even acknowledge her and becomes that thing that she was afraid of. Then there is Dr. Jekyll the opposite of Mr. Hyde, a brilliant scientist and a friend of many people. For instance, Mr. Utterson, his lawyer, who was figuring out how and where he could find the mysterious man that committed this crime. The author continued to give many hints and clues in the story of how the plot unfolded. He used the strategies of having other characters find small details of what was happening. Such as, the letters that were found by Mr. Utterson that had clues to where the suspect was or was headed. The mystery unfolded in a twisted way and the author did a good job of leading the reader to figuring out the mixed up end to the case.<br /><br />I thought this book was amazing. It was one of the best mysteries I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone especially as a first time mystery novel. There is not much I would change about the story, but I would have given Mr. Utterson a better weapon because of the danger of Mr. Hyde.<br />Nick R.

B005FISC52|3.0|I admit that after 8 with weddings,babies, and quite a few near death experiences...season 9 seemed like kind of a let down. Loved the finale but that was about it.<br />Most of the season revolved around Nathan missing and Haley worrying and blaming Dan.<br />The return of Chris and Alex leaving..not so crazy about it.Even though I still think Mia was better for him anyways.<br />Tara was an unnecessary addition.But not so terrible after she tazered Xavier(who btw should never have been brought back in at all).<br />Lucas not playing an active part in finding Nathan.Peyton not appearing at all(she really should have for Tric's tenth anniversary but well..actors do what they have to do).<br />The appearance of Logan was unnecessary but he was a lovable addition-so heck, I guess we'll keep him.<br />Dan's death(Sad but inevitable)<br />The finale showed great promise but<br />A)wth we were promised a full two-hour deal right?<br />B)Not really the old faces you thought would come back(No Alex,No Mia,No Leyton, No Karen,No Erin,No Sam..you get the picture)<br />But I loved the storytelling technique in the finale as well as the songs used. And the ending and final monologue were awesome.<br /><br />So, it was rushed and not in typical Tree Hill fashion. End of review.

B007IK44CK|4.0|I was interested to see what Brad Bird (of The Incredibles) would do with his first live feature. The action sequences are handled very deftly - and there's plenty of them - but the only disappointment is that there's really zero character growth. The Ethan Hunt and team we meet at the beginning of the film is exactly the same as at the end minus the impending nuclear war.<br /><br />The script brings some cartoonish originality to the action and definitely requires the viewer not merely to suspend disbelief but leaving it safely dangling somewhere out of plain sight. There are also enough gadgets to make the average Bond movie look like they ran out of ideas years ago. The plot doesn't make an enormous amount of sense but it hardly matters once you get into the pace.<br /><br />Talking of pace, there's a 5-minute sandstorm sequence which should have been edited out and but it's all forgiven for the adrenalin-fueled run around the world's tallest building. The sequence was enough to give me vertigo and I was amazed that nothing here was green-screened - a tip of the hat to Tom Cruise for being crazy enough to perform his own stunts.<br /><br />The comedy element of the film depends on how much you like Simon Pegg who appears in way too many scenes. Much like fellow British comic Ricky Gervais, his endless capability to play himself from film to film starts to get wearing. In my humble opinion, neither really has the ability to carry themselves in a big screen movie.<br /><br />Ghost Protocol is a fun film to watch and certainly better than most action films I've seen recently. But the lack of character development and the tired comedic moments mean that I probably won't watch it again.
B000W03RHQ|5.0|Nightwish is a fantastic group with such a combination of talent. The style of music is like no other, beautiful yet powerful, thunderous. Truly  captivating. It shows from the epic 'Ghost Love Score' to Tarja's awesome solo in 'Kuolema Teke Taiteilijan'. Tuomas Holopainen is a brilliant composer. This live disc is as good as any of their studio efforts. Unfortunately, this was the last time that Tarja Turunen was the lead vocolist with her powerful and songbird three octave voice. Although the band is still  a force to be reckoned with with Anette, This captures the orignal lineup at their best. Truly one of the best live efforts from any band. This one is a must for your collection. Buy the CD and the DVD so you can enjoy it anytime.

I am far<br />from an expert in sound mixing an design but I am finding this book very helpful, engaging and educational.<br />It also feels like it would be a good fit for those with more experience in the craft as well.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|Terrible movie with about 5 minutes of good action and dialog. Much of the cinematography was dark and hard to see.  Don't waste your money like I did!
B004UID2LC|1.0|it just sucks it don't work and it is just a big virous don't do it. it is not worth the hassle
B00753MBHA|4.0|This Stalingrad cd doesn't have the same fire that Blood of the Nations did. Nations seems to have a nastier edge to it that grew on me very fast. Although Stalingrad is ok, it doesn't have that nasty edge. But it still is a good purchase and maybe after a while it will grow on me a bit more but not like Nations did.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|pretty good game.  it's easy to get on to but difficult enough to stay interesting.  It is easily my second favorite memory type game, right after &quot;epic boobs memory game&quot;. the only thing keeping this from rating 5 stars is the lack of boobs.  it's a fun game anyway.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I remember playing this back on my Commodore 64!!! was having a great time playing (even waiting for more energy) but when the timers on businesses and animals got messed up, not so much. timers go from 40 min to 40 hours!! needs a fix badly before the ratings drop and people decide not play it. and maybe allow people to earn SOME game cash. makes a guy feel like hes been ripped off spending real money in a game just to have it glitch on him.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this product. can easily create notes and sync with notes created through website. the best feature for me is being able to clip webpages and save them to read later
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love the game and its really addicting. you get out of the game by clicking the side bar that brings up the shop and stuff. click on options and the bottom bar pops up. but one bug is that I cant visit neighoboring villages and it says I need to restart the game to update it but there is no updates no matter how many times I restart the game!! that's really annoying because its a challange and I don't have enough acorns to skip it. fix it with a REAL update.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I enjoy playing this game a lot but it freezes for no reason. when you open it again all your energy is missing. its very frustrating.
B00005V9HH|5.0|I first saw this polished gem of a film when I was thirteen. Of course at that age I was blown away by how cool and clever it was. And I think I always will have an affection for it, because despite not being as amazing as I thought, it is a genuinely smart and cool movie, nearly perfect within its own niche.<br /><br />The 'usual suspects' are a group of career criminals rounded up to take some heat for a truck heist. Notable among them are Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a corrupt cop attempting to return to the straight and narrow, and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled con-man. To make the best of a bad situation they plan a few jobs together. However, they quickly find themselves falling deeper and deeper into a web of violence woven by the mysterious master criminal Keyser Soze, who demands payment from all of them for past misdoings. Their story is told in flashback by Verbal to a zealous customs agent the morning after a disastrous attack on a ship in the harbour leaves him the only survivor.<br /><br />I believe that the statutory limitation on spoilers must have been passed by now, but be warned if you continue reading.<br /><br />A few people seem to see this as a standard crime caper with a twist ending, and one that means that the whole story does not make much sense. But it's not really about the story, it's about the fabrication of the story and what it says about the ego of the one telling the tale. The ending deconstructs the slick pretensions of 'cool' crime movies. The evil of Keyser Soze is revealed in the way he tells his own story. To his mind crime is a flashy world of wit, legendary figures, tragic decisions and ruthless exercise of the will. If you pay attention to the details of the story that must be taken to be accurate, they actually paint a picture of a sociopath who uses people and then brutally kills them. The trick this devil pulls is to make us believe that his actions make him more than a man, make him a mythical figure beyond normal humanity, thus bolstering his self-image.<br /><br />So in thinking that this film is clever and cool perhaps I am dancing with the devil. The charm of The Usual Suspects is that it allows us to live inside that dream world for a few hours and enjoy the ride. But then, pfff..it's gone.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This is a cute movie that both adults and children will enjoy.  It's about 30 minutes long so it's easy to watch at any time.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books soooo much! I was disappointed when I discovered that there was only three books in the series. Katniss is a very strong character, and the plots of the books are very intriguing.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is one of the games I play most often on my kindle.  The graphics are great and there are three modes of play.  The quest mode was my favorite.  The game is challenging but is winable.<br /><br />If you like majong and have a kindle this game is for you.  You will not be disappointed

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is highly addictive. Many have complained they can't get out of the app without turning off their kindle fire to get out you have to tap the stuff button on the lower right hand corner then go to options and the bottom bar appears at the bottom bring it up and you can leave the app.
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|When this was shipped, I was at work and my daughter opened it and threw away the shipping package and papers or I would have returned it. Cd is unplayable, warped and scratched. A complete waste of my money, and I'm very disappointed. I will NEVER buy from this location again!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second installment of the Hunger Games is fabulous you can feel all Katniss's emotion. The story line pulls at all your emotion and the descriptive writing makes you feel like this is real and your in it. I would strongly recommend reading all the hunger games books.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|I was immediately pulled into this book.  The heroine of this book is quirky, strong, and independent. I love the southern charm inserted throughout the entire book. This book has everything.... Mystery, humor, and love.. I stayed up until midnight for two days because I could not put it down. I love the relationship between Rose and Joe and hope this becomes a series. Can't wait for Twenty-nine and a Half Reasons in June!!! Will download as soon as its released!!

0525423656|4.0|There is something so subtle and layered and soft-spoken and quiet about Ally Condie's writing that I first enjoyed in MATCHED and now appreciated all over again in reading it's sequel, CROSSED.  There's almost a poetic quality to the softness of her writing, and as poetry is interspersed throughout her story, it seems fitting. There is a beauty to her descriptions (and she lives in Utah so sees the beauty all the time that inspired the setting for this particular book) that allows us to actually feel like this book is an escape, for the reader and the characters, from the Society and world that she has built. This is a second book in a trilogy, and it is more about setting up these characters for what I imagine will be a heroic stand in the final book. The first book was about Cassia discovering that the Society isn't what she really thought, and this one is about her discovering that there might be more to her than she really thought - all with Ky being her central guiding light. But, there is always Xander in the background.<br /><br />This is the story of a journey: a journey for Cassia to find Ky, a journey for Cassia to discover the strength she needs and who she can really be, a journey for Ky to discover what matters the most, a journey for the whole group to discover their paths and get to where they need to go.  It's a physical journey to get from Society to the rebellion, but while on that physical journey through the canyon, it's also an internal journey for each of the characters to make to find out what their true path will be.<br /><br />This is not an action-packed book, but the thoughtful pacing does keep it moving forward through the alternating perspectives/chapters of Ky and Cassia. There are moments of suspense, mostly as we wonder if everyone will survive the journey - and not everyone can, but there are also moments of suspense as Ky and Cassia try to discover if their love for each other will line up with their individual needs and keep them together or tear them apart. Secrets abound from Xander to newcomer Indie, to Ky and Cassia as well. The book reads as a slow unfolding of information from their past lives and what got them to this point, that will eventually guide their ultimate decision in the end. Vick and Eli and Hunter are secondary characters introduced in this book that I grew to enjoy, and hope some might make a reappearance in the final book as well.<br /><br />If you enjoyed MATCHED and want a thought-provoking, quiet look into what Cassia and Ky will go through and ultimately find to be most important in their lives, and to set yourself up for the final book in the trilogy, get your hands on CROSSED.<br /><br />Review originally posted on Heise Reads & Recommendstogether or tear them apart.

B0074MZSWW|3.0|I'd be curious to see how many other reviews were people who bought the vinyl or mp3, I bought the CD for the best high fidelity.<br />I think the mix is bad. To top end and harsh on the vocals. (was the sound engineer going for a vintage sound ?)<br />I love the band, and after seeing them on Conan, I've been waiting for the release.<br />I've tried it in my car, and now my computer. I will try it on my home system which is really high tech and usually brings out top end even harsher, like my records, which, I only play on my seperate tube stereo system, reserved for vinyl.<br />I can tell the music is there, but disappointed in the sound quality.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This book is very good and the Kindle version does the original justice.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend reading this book for the analysis of a sport that is much misinterpreted.
B005HP2J66|5.0|Explorers find a new cave (Chauvet Cave) in France. Inside are numerous incredible drawings of animals, especially horses - both individually and in groups. Animals depicted also include lions, wolves, rhinoceroses, ibexes, and mammoths. Some are even shown in motion, with 8 feet. Carbon dating establishes that the paintings were completed around some 32,000 years ago, though some (done on top of others) were 4-5 thousand years later than others.<br /><br />My rough guess - the earlier paintings were done some 750+ generations ago. That certainly makes the viewer wonder about his predecessors - what other talents did they have (primitive flutes were found in similar sites), what did they think about, how did they live? Narrators tell us that Neanderthal Man also lived in the area at that time, but left no such drawings or artifacts. The fact that no other evidence of man was found, except for a small grouping of stones and hand-prints within the cave, is especially eerie.<br /><br />Footprints of an 8-year-old boy alongside paw prints made by a wolf - did they walk side by side, or were they made thousands of years apart. Numerous bear claw-marks on the walls, as well as skulls on the floor.<br /><br />Thankfully the French Government has taken strong steps to preserve and study the site, and the film crew was allowed to make an excellent recording of it.

B004X8W468|5.0|This is simply an amazing book, well deserving of the Newbery Prize.  It's what I would call a coming-of-age story, but it is done in such a subtle, beautiful way.  The first thing that grabbed me was the time travel theme because I love a story that has that element to it.  And, that does make it mysterious and fun to think about.  But, really it has so much more to offer.  It's about Miranda maturing and coming to understand so many things--friendship, empathy, kindness--even a first kiss.  I loved how human Miranda is--she's not perfect, but she recognizes when she's falling short.  I love the mother-daughter relationship, full of love and trust.  I love how Miranda thinks about things--working everything out in her head.  And, I love the homage to A Wrinkle in Time, another great Newbery winner.  Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|I love baseball and generally love movies about baseball.  This movie is a slightly different twist on the usual \\"bad team comes back to win\\" theme.  I was intrigued by the forward thinking of the general manager in the movie and absolutely loved this movie.  I generally don't buy a movie unless it's one that I really love--and Moneyball is one of those.
006145205X|1.0|Science has worked out progress through making useful applications derived from the knowledge gained by scrutinizing nature and learning how does it works. No doubt about it. So it has done for making us more efficient at exterminating everything, including us and the environment.<br /><br />This fool dismisses the ozone hole alert and the work done in Limits to Growth, just saying there's no evidence about this predictions (maybe on the planet he lives in). Recently Limits to growth former group leader Dennis Meadows was acknowledged for his work: \\"Limits to Growth Author Honored for Once-Ridiculed Warnings\\". Foolish irrational optimism won't lead us far from collapse of civilization.<br /><br />The toughest problem we face is not environment itself and the limits it exerts upon us, but our  lack of humanitarian behavior.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I honestly took a chance on this film. Man, I shouldnt have taken a chance and just bought it. This film was great. I never heard alot about it when it was released in the theaters. Wish I would have went there to see it to. Great film, great actors, good story. A++ film here!

B004XDYJRU|4.0|I really like this app.  Radio Stations from all over the country/world. The only problem is that some stations do not buffer well.  Without the buffering problem, I'd give it 5 stasrs.
B006C45MRE|3.0|This movie cost almost 170 million dollars to make which honestly does not play as a 170 million dollar movie.  It does not matter what movie it is, if I have to hit the fast forward button due to extended long boring scenes then it was not money well spent.  My 3$ I paid was not the loss, the 170 million dollars was the loss.<br /><br />Any how the lead acting and some of the alien scenes was what compelled me to watch on, other than that it's just average.<br /><br />Watch on a rainy day.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a dissappointment this book is.  To each their own but the fact that this book is all the rage is beyond me.  It reads like the thoughts of an 8th grader.

At first I felt funny telling people I was reading such a steamy novel, but the story was so realistic and the characters so real I felt obliged to tell everyone I know to go get these books. Absolutely awesome!!
B0074EIQQU|5.0|i have all the mars volta cds and they took forever to grow on me. im not saying thats a bad thing at all. i love cds that grow and grow on you after each listen. noctourniquet grew on me instantly. the songs are more structured like actual songs. again not a bad thing. there are alot of interesting sounds goin on in this album for sure. every song is a standout to me. i could listen to this disk every day. this is a top contender for 2012 best album along with high on fire, meshuggah, and lamb of god. do yourself a favor,.. if you have some spare cash go out and buy this bad boy. pretty sure you wont regret it. money well spent.i highly recommend this product. have a good day everyone.
0439023513|2.0|I began reading this book with exceptionally high expectations, simply due to the fact the previous two in the series were so marvellously written with a storyline that was exiting at almost all points.  For the large part of the book, Mockingjay is wonderful, and lives up to the standard set by the other two books.  However, the ending was very poor.  By that I do not mean, I was annoyed by the fact the series did not have a particularly cheery conclusion. But progressing through the book, the story gradually gets more exiting, with suspense building, only to lead the reader to a dull anticlimax which almost seemed out of place with everything else. It was perhaps the only part of this trilogy that I've considered a bore to read.  Very disappointing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is not too bad at all. a few of the games are a bit too challenging to complete and some minor glitches but overall great for passing time and its free. I do however wish I could access all the games without having to gain so many points.

1612130283|5.0|I am not an avid reader of \\"erotic fiction\\", but decided to jump on the bandwagon after seeing the author on the Today Show.  The book is not overly well-written (similar to Twilight), but did have a way of keeping me captivated.  I finished the book in about a day and half, and I work full time so I found it to be a real page-turner.<br /><br />There is a lot repetitive language:  Ana blushes. She blushes again. She turns crimson and says Jeez and Oh Crap and Damn and blushes again. (Repeat every page or paragraph or every sentence or so.)<br /><br />I did enjoy Ana's inner monologues, and I felt a connection with her.  Aside from the S&M stuff, there is a genuine storyline here where a girl falls for someone she shouldn't (haven't we all at some point?) which make it a natural connection.  The passionate parts are somewhat intense in a non-pornographic way (again, thoughts we've all probably had).<br /><br />The second book starts right where the last one left off, so if you find yourself a fan of it, order #2 before you finish because you'll want it handy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a good deal for the entertainment value. its good for all ages and best of all its free
B006OV7RQ4|4.0|Along with the somewhat better \\"Take Shelter,\\" here is this film to make for a good year, so far, for psychological thrillers. We see some fine performances here, including a justifiably celebrated one from Elizabeth Olsen and another excellent one by John Hawkes (Winter's Bone).<br /><br />The reviews of this film on amazon.com are shaping up, as I like to call it, as \\"bipolar.\\"  Lots of 5's, lots of 1's, and not so many in between. Your basic love-it-or-hate it deal. I've noted that often the movies with reviews distributed this way are slower-paced films, and especially those with ambiguous ending. \\"MMMM\\" builds up a lot of tension in the course of the movie and then gives us a really ambiguous endings. I almost always side with the folks who like the uncertain endings. Loved, for example, \\"No Country for Old Men.\\"  Gotta say, though, this ending did bug me quite a bit. It's not so much that the ending wasn't spelled out--the film gives you plenty of information about whether it's a good or bad ending--it's just that there's nothing artful in the way the ending is presented.<br /><br />That said, it's generally a very well crafted movie about some things about which we don't see enough good art. I've never seen a better movie on cults and rarely do we see psychological torment so realistically and painfully portrayed. I'll be sure to see everything else Sean Durkin gives us.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|Progressive rockers Jethro Tull released their fourth album Aqualung in April of 1971.<br />By 1971, Jethro Tull were a modestly successful blues rock band spearheaded by lead singer/songwriter Ian Anderson, a wild-eyed Englishman decked out in tights and sashes and using a FLUTE as his rock and roll weapon of choice. Anderson was joined by guitarist Martin Barre (still Tull's guitarist today), keyboard player John Evan, then-new bass player Jeffrey Hammond (who replaced original bass player Glenn Cornice) and drummer Clive Bunker (whom left the band after this album was finished).<br />Contrary to popular belief, Aqualung is not a concept album. However, the songs all have different topics from religion to homeless people to life in general. Many people always say Jethro Tull suck with comments like \\"they are minstrel rock\\", \\"boring\\" among others. Tull combined rock with folk so well that they made many a great albums. Here is the synopsis of Aqualung.<br />The album's opening title cut introduces to a man named Aqualung who happens to be a homeless man. The music and the lyrics to this epic are just excellent on this rock radio staple which is probably playing on the radio as I write this. Next is \\"Cross Eyed Mary\\" which is a rocker about a dirty girl who did things that the good girls didn't dare try. The flute is superb here and Barre's guitar just rocked here. We have a nice short breather, the autobiographical \\"Cheap Day Return\\" which is acoustic in nature. We follow with the folkish-rocker \\"Mother Goose\\" which is another great song. Next is the relatively short but sweet \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" is next and also autobiographical. \\"Up to Me\\" rounds out the first half and is a great song.<br />The album's second half which is Pro-God/anti-organized religion in theme and content starts with the epic \\"My God\\" which is a great song. Next was the album's third rock radio staple \\"Hymn 43\\" which is a great rocker. \\"Slipstream\\" follows and is a short acoustic breather from the second half which is \\"pro-God and anti-Religion\\" in tone. Next is the last rock radio staple from the album the chugging rocker \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and God is referred to as \\"Old Charlie\\" and just an awesome song with a superb Anderson flute solo. The album closes with another epic fittingly called \\"Wind Up\\" which winds up this album in a grand way.<br />Aqualung was the album that made Jethro Tull stars in the US as it reached #7 on the Billboard album chart and sold millions rightfully so to this day.<br />In 2011, EMI (Capitol Records in the States) re-released Jethro Tull's classic as a 2-CD remaster for its 40th Anniversary. The first CD is the original album newly remixed in 2011 by Porcupine Tree mastermind Steven Wilson and he doesn't compress nor destroy the new mixes and this is one of the best remixing jobs on an album I ever heard (only what James Guthrie did with the remixes of Dark Side and Wish You Were Here give this a run for its money) and also remastered brilliantly by Peter Mew at Abbey Road. The second disc is worth buying alone. The first track 1 is \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\" which was recorded for the album outtake but scrapped. The song first appeared on the 1996 25th Anniversary remaster. It's here in a 2011 'New Mix'. Next is \\"Just Trying To Be\\" which was also left off the original album and first appeared on the 1972 double album Living In The Past. This is a 2011 'New Mix'. We also have early takes of the classic \\"My God\\", \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\", \\"Wind Up\\" (with Ian Anderson on piano) plus the second take of \\"Slipstream\\", an early version of \\"Up The 'Pool\\" and the real treat is the full version of \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" called \\"Wond'ring Aloud, Again\\" featuring the whole band and extra verses. We then have the first recorded project to feature drummer Barriemore Barlow which was the Life Is a Long Song EP which comprised of the title cut, \\"Up The Pool\\", \\"Dr Bogenbroom\\", \\"From Later\\" and \\"Nursie\\". Since the EP format never caught on in the States,the EP comprised of much of Side 4 of the Living In The Past double LP in 1972. Lastly is the commercial for the album used on US rock radio. It also comes with a 32-page booklet and the discs look like the original UK LP (nice touch).<br />Aqualung still sounds fresh and reverant today and this deluxe re-issue is recommended!the EP comprised of much of Side 4 of the Living In The Past double LP in 1972.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|Before I Go To Sleep is an good take on the amnesia cliche, a la \\"Momento\\" - a woman discovers every day that she isn't where she thinks she should be, doesn't know how she got there, and is beyond freaked out when she finds out how old she is. And she only knows the truth by reading what she thinks she wrote the days before in a journal. A disorienting and frightening experience, obviously, which is portrayed well to the reader in just the first few pages.  After the first few pages, the author does a great job of sucking the reader into the narrative of the journal - causing the reader to forget about the fact that the journal writer's realiability might not be so great.  It's a great mind twist.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the ending.  The author made a fatal mistake in writing suspense:  Don't make the ending too guessable.  And with only a few characters in the book to pick from as being the \\"bad guy\\", and so few \\"explinations\\" to the situation, it's pretty obvious what the ending will be.
B006TVQU6C|4.0|I've had this case for about a month or so and find it the most decent budget case out there today. No power supply but it is rigged to accept all the new high power large foot print PSU's on the market. It's all steel with a plastic front bezel as most cases. The steel is a thin gauge which makes it very light however, some sound proofing would have been nice since thin sheet metal means poor acoustics. The PSU is bottom mounted, there's water cooling ports if needed, USB 3.0 ports in front or use the Antec supplied adapter in the event you will be using a USB 2.0 motherboard. Lots of space for hard drives, cables etc and it'll support a 10.5\\" long video card. The only draw back I found was the rear expansion ports are not fitted with replaceable covers, they are punch out design so, once you knock them out, there's no going back with a covered slot hole. Another is the feet material on this case are plastic vs. silicone rubber as most Antec cases have.<br /><br />The best feature I found was the case comes with 2 120mm fans; both (rear and top mounted) which have the 3 pin header interface for those who want their fans to run in variable speed mode based on signals from the motherboard heat sensors. Also, the front panel switches are decent and the led power on and hard drive activity lights illuminate just right, small and bright enough to see them in a well lit room. Wiring is of good quality as are their label features.<br /><br />There's room for three more 120mm fans; front, bottom and side panel for those who might run 2 or more graphic cards. Overall, worth the price for the outcome by large amounts.  As a result, you can spend the difference saved on a better efficient grade higher powered PSU or the like. Just the right size for newer components plus it looks good close up or from distances.
0385344228|4.0|William Landay's bestselling novel, \\"Defending Jacob,\\" is both a legal thriller and a searing portrayal of a family's anguish as it endures a crisis alone, abandoned by friends and neighbors.<br /><br />The main character, Andy Barber, is the first assistant district attorney in a tony Boston suburb. He adores his wife, Laurie, and their son, Jacob. He is at the top of his game professionally. As the senior staff attorney reporting to the elected District Attorney, Barber gets his pick of the high-profile cases to prosecute.<br /><br />When a student is found dead in a leafy park near the high school, Barber takes the case. But this is no ordinary murder. Andy Barber's comfortable world is turned upside down when Jacob is arrested for the murder of classmate Ben Rifkin.<br /><br />Landay explores these central questions: do parents really know their children, how far will they go to protect their children, and what happens to the fragile family dynamic when their beliefs about the basic goodness of their children are challenged? He also explores the variables that shape our children, from nurture versus nature to genetic behavioral predispositions.<br /><br />The 14-year-old Jacob is in many ways a typical teen-ager. He is a puzzle to his parents, an unpopular student in school, and an active user of social media. He has few friends and some classmates view him as weird. He is guarded in his communications with his parents, revealing little about his life.<br /><br />Andy Barber has a secret of his own. His father and grandfather were murderers. After Jacob's arrest, he finally reveals his secret to Laurie, fearing the prosecution will use it to demonstrate the existence of a \\"murder gene\\" in his son's DNA.<br /><br />When the evidence begins to point toward Jacob, the District Attorney takes Andy Barber off the case and he is suspended with pay. Classmates tell police Jacob had a knife and a possible motive, since Ben Rifkin bullied him. And then Jacob's fingerprint is found on the dead boy's jacket.<br /><br />The scenes where the Barbers meet with their attorney and a psychologist hired by the defense are among the most interesting in the book. During these meetings the Barbers learn some harsh, uncomfortable truths about their son. Landay, a former prosecutor, gives the reader an insider's glimpse of the strategies and tactics of both the prosecution and defense and adds deft insights into the courts and the legal system.<br /><br />As the trial progresses to its conclusion, a surprising plot twists jar the reader, but it's the brilliant and shocking ending to this story that leaves the reader both satisfied and unsettled.<br /><br />Readers who like Scott Turow will enjoy this story, though I found Landay's characters not as complex as the characters that grace Turow's novels. Still, this was a suspenseful and worthwhile read.t is found on the dead boy's jacket.<br /><br />The scenes where the Barbers meet with their attorney and a psychologist hired by the defense are among the most interesting in the book.

B0073LWEXK|3.0|I had fun playing the app with my 6 year old. I was a little disappointed that it was so easy and so short. It took about 2 hours to finish. I'm not quite sure why so many people had trouble with navigating or needing to use a lot of hints. We used one hint and I will admit it was confusing to figure out which hint I needed to use. Overall we had fun I just expected a little more from a paid app.
0345803485|1.0|I'm in the middle of book one (reading it on the ipad) and while i am a very sexually open and porn watching girl, this book is borderline pathetic/hysterical. The guy is a freak but that's all fine and dandy, but the girl is completely pathetic. First of all i think you can use a better word for your lady parts than \\"my sex\\" yeah okay that's hot...and she's like this pathetic little yes sir anything you want sir because she's never gotten laid before. Ugh she's the girl you'd like to slap in the head if she was real.<br /><br />Not for nothing...but if you want to write a sexy book, use sexy words. No one wants to hear penis and \\"my sex\\"  um COCK AND PUSSY MUCH?
1451683405|1.0|After two admirable books dealing with religious belief, Mr. Harris has forsaken reason, logic and just plain observation, to write a monograph on \\"free will\\" so pregnant with blind faith in his belief that we don't have it, that I felt infuriated and cheated.  Cheated, because I was fooled into thinking the book would be a thoughtful treatise on volitional consciousness, which it certainly is not.  Infuriated, because of a complete lapse of reason and the misuse of it, in the cause of saying it doesn't exist!  At the start of the monograph, he (with some help from researchers) misinterprets some electrophysiological studies of the human brain, as being evidence for the \\"billiard ball\\" theory of free will - that all our thoughts and actions are merely reactions to the internal circuitry within the brain over which we have no control.  He, astutely, understands the dilemma this creates for any theory of justice or morality.  Unfortunately, he can't offer any coherent way to deal with this problem except to say that bad behavior would be \\"out of character\\" for certain people and we are guided by our \\"intentions\\".  Of course Mr. Harris can't really \\"know\\" any of these things he is talking about, since human reasoning would require choices in deciding whether or not something said was true of false!  Reasoning (using logic to understand reality) requires mental focus (concentrating one's mind on the task at hand) and also the ability to make choices (chance is not good enough here!) over what is true and what is not true about the physical and mental (abstract) observations we make.  Please come back to reality, Mr. Harris.  What were you thinking (or not)?!<br /><br />If one wants some understanding on the topic of \\"free will\\", one's little time would be much better spent reading Ayn Rand's conception of volitional consciousness.  Although, she is much maligned in the public eye, ignored by most academic postmodern philosophers (probably mostly out of jealousy), and not mentioned in this monograph, Rand has offered a cogent theory of consciousness, based on the simple observation of human nature.  My bet is that science will eventually vindicate her understanding!t mentioned in this monograph, Rand has offered a cogent theory of consciousness, based on the simple observation of human nature.  My bet is that science will eventually vindicate her understanding!

B006XIR9KM|5.0|this is your classic memory game with a couple of twists. firstly the tiles can and do move and also disappear! then you get the 'power ups' from time to time. you have to get 9 matches to lengthen your time. has a great soundtrack and will occupy you for short periods very easily.<br />also @superman75 learn to brain! this isn't a complicated game. if its not your style of game, simply don't review it!

0439023521|1.0|Mark Twain defined a literary classic as \\"a book which people praise and don't read.\\"<br /><br />I've enjoyed reading classics since I was sixteen years old (a Poe anthology had me completely mesmerized!). I read George Orwell's 1984 during my early 20s, and it's by far one of the best books I've ever read.<br /><br />1984 can be considered a classic cyberpunk and dystopian novel.<br /><br />Cyberpunk can be defined as a genre that \\"is about expressing (often dark) ideas about human nature, technology and their respective combination in the near future.\\" (Cyberpunk Review)<br /><br />Dystopia (HUNGER GAMES = \\"YA Dystopia\\") can be defined as: \\"An imaginary place or state in which the condition of life is extremely bad, as from deprivation, oppression, or terror.\\" (The Free Dictionary)<br /><br />I was talking to a friend from the U.K. recently, who had this to say about commercialism:<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"Wow! I never knew about BATTLE ROYALE. To be honest, I hated THE HUNGER GAMES without knowing anything about it. Partly it was because I kept seeing it in the Kindle best seller charts. I assumed it was just some badly written self-published garbage that had been hyped on Twitter. But I see now it has been hyped everywhere and has big money behind it.<br /><br />These big companies are businesses first and foremost. Stories are product. The ones they pick up are largely irrelevant. The marketing campaign is the main thing. Well, in fact the return on capital is the main thing. The marketing campaign is the way to achieve that. The product is just one small piece in the corporate plan.<br /><br />I have always been put off by commercialism in any media. In fact I'm prejudiced against commercially successful things. Too much trash is touted as worth our while. Journalists desperate for readers jump on any bandwagon they can. Things are famous because they are famous and not because of any intrinsic merit. This is truer now than it's ever been.\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />I think it's scary how \\"dystopia\\" itself has become a marketing label. I think it's scary when people trash classic books as being \\"for pretentious people\\" only, while they praise modern-day bestsellers as being superior to classic books because \\"these books were more popular\\" than classic texts that (1) had some amount of depth to them, and (2) have stood the test of time. I think it's scary how quality doesn't seem to matter anymore, because some people see the 'elite' as being 'elitist'.<br /><br />Crass commercialism and corporate greed often go hand in hand. This is the real dystopia, where hype replaces meaning, where mediocrity is celebrated over something original and substantial, all in the name of profits. After all, how good can something really be if it can be replaced by another manufactured franchise in the next 5-10 years?<br /><br />Keep that in mind when the next hyped franchise comes around :)!<br /><br />-- author of THE HYPE GAMES: A HG Parody (Spring 2012; in \\"tribute\\" to everyone who stood up for BATTLE ROYALE and Stephen King's works)/><br />I think it's scary how \\"dystopia\\" itself has become a marketing label.

B007LB1O3I|2.0|Sorry, but this is as a whole, not a good effort, except the brilliant campaign from the very effective marketing team. Between the sneak release of \\"Give Me All Your Luvin\\" and Madonna's masterfully designed Superbowl performance I was really psyched to get MDNA and even pre-ordered it. The first two-thirds of the album has Madonna (still) playing the dance floor tart, now accessorized with weaponry (Gang Bang). One redeeming exception is \\"Falling Free,\\" an affecting ballad in that latter third of the album.<br /><br />Many have complained about Madge wearing her sexuality on her er, sleeve - at her age. That's not the problem. I think the disappointment stems from that Madonna, a woman with such a commanding presence, offers such a flimsy dance-hookup-dance thesis as this. Especially unbecoming is how she stoops to commodify herself, reducing her self-definition to pitching herself as an addictive substance (in the hook \\"MDNA, MDMA, MDNA, MDNA\\"). She doesn't need to reiterate that at this stage - it undermines her authority and makes herself decrepit by the botox recruiting of Minaj and M.I.A. She used to collaborate in ways that were elevating and revelatory as with Bjork's song \\"Bedtime Story.\\" This is regression and even strictly as dance floor fodder, the beats here seem to move through freshly poured cement. Madonna's ready for her close-up: \\"I'm still big. It's just the dance floors that got smaller.\\"<br /><br />P.S. On another note, Madonna's beef with Gaga over \\"Express Yourself\\"/\\"Born This Way\\" has been settled. \\"Love Spent\\" practically clones \\"Telephone,\\" chord for chord.

0545265355|5.0|I admit, I was a latecomer to the party with the Hunger Games.  I had the same knee-jerk reactions to the subject matter.  And in truth, I do find it a much more palatable rip-off of the much more adult and sicker Battle Royale manga series from the early 00s.  That said, it is a GREAT story.  When I first saw the movie, I had not yet read the books, so the movie takes on a slightly more sinister air.  But the complete story is very good, with echoing themes of 1984 and Animal Farm, with warnings to both government overreach and the capacity for power to corrupt.  Being this is a book for younger audiences, the book is a bit ham-handed and not extremely deep in its message, but that message is clear.  I really do like the insistence on the main characters that shades of gray are not acceptable, that there is good and evil, right and wrong, and evil deeds wrapped in good intentions are still evil.  These are very important lessons in any civil society.  Might does not necessarily make right.  With solid foundations such as these in their youth, hopefully some of that youthful idealism translates into future leaders making just and even-handed decisions.  In the end, isn't that what great art can do in society?<br /><br />The book is interesting in the fact it is told from the first person, from Katniss Everdeen, a young person's point of view, who has been thrust as a pawn into a much bigger game that she has little control over.  While her self-doubt and guilt tends to pile up and get a little tiresome, I think it is an accurate reflection on someone who feels powerless to control their own fate.  When Katnis steps up to change her fate, it is predictable, but still satisfying.  In the end, this is a fairly predictable, but rip-roaring yarn that is a pleasure to read.  It really sucks you in and does not let you go.  I finished all three books in about 2 weeks.  The pages just flew by.  I recommend it for readers 13 and up.

0143119680|5.0|Vampires, witches and daemons all doing yoga together! What's not to like?  Yes, professor of history and witch-in-denial Diana Bishop is taken to a strange and unique yoga class by her love interest Matthew, non other than a 1500 year old vampire.  Vampires and witches are not supposed to mix but this doesn't stop Diana and Matthew from falling in love and bringing hell down on both their houses.  When Diana discovers a lost historical book, Ashmole 782 in Oxford's Bodleian Library, she suddenly becomes the centre of attention in the supernatural world.  All eyes are watching to see what her next move will be and Diana is forced to confront her life-long denial of the magic that runs through the ancestral line of Bishop women dating all the way back to Salem, Massachusetts.<br /><br />This has to be one of the most intelligently written books I've read in a long time.  It was well researched and full of interesting historical anecdotes and lessons.  This book reminded me of Dan Brown's novels in parts, particularly Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code and I couldn't help picturing the character Matthew Clairmont as Robert Langdon from those Dan Brown books.<br /><br />I love learning about the past and as a former history student, I enjoyed the books Diana explored, the research she carried out in the library, and the stories provided by Matthew.  He is living history but I did it find it somewhat hard to believe that he happened to know so many of history's most renowned players but this is fiction I suppose and some suspension of disbelief is required.  As a lover of going out for meals and trying new wines myself I enjoyed Diana's sumptuous descriptions of the food and wine they ate and drank.  The vivid depictions of Oxford and the castle estate in France were beautiful and easy to picture.<br /><br />The characters were vividly evoked, from the heroine and powerful witch Diana to the gentleman/knight in shining armour Matthew and his vampire mother Ysabeau through to Diana's aunts Em and Sarah.  Matthew is an attractive vampire both physically and intellectually but he was a little too good for my liking.  I hope to see some `bad boy' elements appear in him in the next book.  On a few occasions the characters came close to consummating their `marriage' but Matthew always pulled back.  Men being the ones to exercise caution seems to be a running theme in the fiction I've been reading lately, hmmm.  I have to admit I was cringing at times when Diana referred to Marcus as her son  and the romance was over the top but anyone who knows me or has read my blog is aware that I'm a sucker for a good love story and a hopeless romantic.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this and will be purchasing the next part of the trilogy in 2012.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen a bit more action in the bedroom department :) but hopefully this will be sorted in the next book

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Our Book Club had been hearing great reviews about this series. So much so we took out a book and put Hunger Games in. The best story was from a principal who was having a huge Christmas party and would actually sneak to her bathroom (several times) to read a few pages and then get back to her party. Well with that kind of testimony we had to read it and then went to the movie. Given these books were written for teens to young adults we were a little skeptical.  Bottom line we all loved the series, so well written and captivating we all found ourselves stay up late into the night (am) and hiding out in bathrooms as well.  We had a lot to discuss at book club night and the movie though not as good as the book was really well done.  To say the least we all were hooked.

She portrayed her bombshell beauty and bubbly personality that Marilyn Monroe had. The plot was very solid and other performances by the other supporting actors and actresses including Dougary Scott, Emma Watson and Judi Dench were brilliant as well. This film overall was absolutely amazing in every way. No one could have played Marilyn but Michelle Williams! Definitely worth a view for any Marilyn fan or any movie fan who wants to see an excellent film!

Beyond the cost, I haven't made it through every disc. The discs I have seen are amazing. The transfer is well done and the making of features for Alien and Aliens are incredible. The making of features alone are worth the cost. I highly recommend getting this set.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This CD is wonderful.  Out of 17 tracks, there was only one I didn't particularly care for and that was the duet with Aretha Franklin.  Great choice of artist and songs.  It's so nice to listen to songs being sung without rasps, growls, and screeching.  I am really enjoying this music.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids live this. it keeps them busy for hours!!! I wish there were more games like this for kids to play.<br />lots of fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use YouVersion's Bible everday be reading one of its English translations or searching for a specific phrase or listening to the audio versions. I know have access to the word of God literally every where I go!  Thanks to YouVersion.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I have absolutely enjoyed reading the Clifton Chronicles, The Sins of the Father being the second book in the series.  Jeffrey Archer has the wonderful ability of being able to describe his characters and schenes in such a way that the reader feels like he or she is actually part of the story.  I found it to be absolutely Riveting, an absolute show stopper......I sincerely hope that there is a third book in the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm hooked I find that the few problems I have had are not enough to keep me from playing this game I really like it!
B005HSL626|5.0|I fell in the game about fruit and ninjas. I was amazed how hungry I was after playing the game for long time.
B006XIR9KM|4.0|I downloaded, installed, and played once just to experience this game for myself. It seems like it's a good puzzler but not one for me. Uninstalled.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was so exicted when I saw they had angry birds for the kindle fire. It's one of the best games I got for my Kindle Fire. If I were you I'd get the game
B000IAZ5HK|4.0|Very cute.  Seems well made so far - glass is sturdy and top fits snuggly.  It's a keeper.  Don't have any more to say on this!
B001DLWF8U|1.0|AMAZING THE WAY THIS MOVIE WAS ABLE TO SO COMPLETELY UNDER-DELIVER ANYTHING AT ALL.  TRULY A MASTERWORK OF NOTHINGNESS!<br /><br />I THOUGHT, \\"BLACK AND WHITE? HMM, SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS GOOD.\\"  NOPE.<br /><br />YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF MOVIE: YOU EXPECT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN ANY MOMENT, ANY MOMENT, MAYBE NOW, AND THEN IT MERCIFULLY ENDS BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANYTHING.  NADA. ZIP. ZERO.<br /><br />JUST GUESSING, BUT I THINK EVERYONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAKING OF THIS MOVIE GOT 6 TO 10 IN A MEDIUM SECURITY CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION.<br /><br />SPARE YOURSELF REAL PAIN -- SLAM HEAD IN FRIG DOOR INSTEAD.
0439023491|5.0|DId not know they were making a movie of this. My daughter recomened it to me quite a while back and I finally got it. Excellant story line. Seems to have some warnings between the lines. Maybe a litle political on that but too fast moving to stop and think on it too long. But reminds us life is going to change in a heartbeat and we better be ready.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I started this book with a healthy libido and a respect for the writer's enthusiasm for BDSM, as a matter of fact it made me sorta interested in exploring all of the various things the lifestyle includes.  By the end, though, I wanted a little more substance, a little less sex.  Simply put, this book is scorchingly hot, but like most bimbos, it has little between the ears. The email witty repartee got old, and the willshe wontshe became stale after the first seven sex scenes.  Not really my favorite sexy novel.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|I dislike so much about this movie.  But I love the Arnold versions from the 80's.<br /><br />The problem is that this new guy looks like a \\"model\\" and isn't believable to have lived the life of conan..  He's too much \\"pretty/prissy boy\\"<br /><br />Also, i dont like how flexible and agile he is.. too \\"nimble\\" for a Conan<br /><br />The Conan i want to see should be a massive tank.. that just hulks his way through mountains of enemies like a bulldozer, using shear brute force.<br /><br />We need someone that looks like they could be a linebacker on a football team..  someone that is even a bit ugly so that they seem like they have had a tough life to become Conan.<br /><br />Think \\"Clingon Warrior\\".. only more human.. and you have a conan.<br /><br />Pick someone missing a few teeth and an ugly mug with scars and you'd have a more believable conan than the one we see in this flick.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Bared to You is an gut wrenching erotic roller coaster with twists and turns that will leave you whip-lashed.<br /><br />Eva Tramell is starting a new job in a new city and trying to leave all of her emotional and dysfunctional baggage behind - but fate has a way of changing all of that.  In an unexpected run in with a tall, dark and delicious stranger Eva tries her best to keep the thoughts of this man out of her head. Only to find out - in a chance meeting (or is it) that this deliciousness happens to be the billionaire, Gideon Cross, that owns the company she works for and half of the city.<br />From that office meeting come the most intense relationship that I have ever read.  Gideon tells Eva exactly what he wants from her and at that moment - that very sentence I was completely in love!<br />The relationship with Eva and Gideon is highly erotic, explosively emotional and darkly delicious!<br />The secondary character of Cary adds an amazing mix of even more delicious men - and an incredible relationship and friendship with him and Eva.<br />This was my first book by Sylvia Day and I am highly addicted. Can not wait until Deeper in You comes out and we get to continue this amazing story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - and no I did not read 50 Shades and chose this book over that based on reviews.<br />This book will leave you wanting more Gideon that for sure...<br />At least that is where I am at right now!
B00364K6YW|4.0|The item came in a timely matter and in good condition. I have watched it and there seemed to be a glitch in one area but I backed it up and played again and it seemed fine. Excellent movie!
B007M6P01O|5.0|Not sure where it all came from but the zombie/apocalyptic bug must have bitten me too. With the great writing, acting, and directing, this series is a must watch.
B006XIR9KM|1.0|This game takes your precious time and memory by absorbing your intellect on flash matches that are only ment to be memorized...... Please be advised that no slow version in this game is involved and praying for an update will only cause you to suffer. I believe Retro Dreamer is dreaming to convert all andriod users into slaves by creating this app and hurting the brains of those who are slow and otherwise &quot;old&quot; as most people say.... not sure if my review made sense lol but 1 star for faotd :D (mad yet?!) hahahhhaaha I have the power you see lmao
B004G6TCMQ|5.0|Nearly forty-two years after its recording, this eponymous debut album is still as expansive and interesting to me as when I first heard it in early 1971.  It's hard to believe that such masterful musicianship came from three guys in their early twenties, but gorgeous it was and continues to be.  Yes, \\"Lucky Man\\" was overplayed on the FM airwaves, but it's a great track, and I can still enjoy it.  My personal favorites are \\"Take A Pebble\\" and \\"Tank,\\" the latter possessing some of the finest power drumming this side of Buddy Rich.  The music on this album has a muscular freshness that grips you by the throat, lays you down gently, and then devours you at the end.  While later efforts may be seen as exercises in overblown commericalism, this first album delivered the band's initial effort with tasteful aplomb.  Emerson, formerly of The Nice, and Lake, fresh from King Crimson blended their talents with Carl Palmer (The Crazy World of Arthur Brown band) to craft something beautiul and uniquely their own.  Palmer's drumming is incredibly creative, and his technical virtuosity punctuates the band's sound with clean precision.  The crisp sound on this re-master is unprecedented in any former release.  This is an album that represents some of the finest rock classics of the decade, and is an absolute 5-star piece of work.
044024630X|5.0|To my mind The Affair is one of the better of the Reacher books. From the word go its an interesting tale. Clearly Lee Child has a formula going here along the lines of Jack stumbles upon some misdeeds and sorts them with a mixture of his sharp analytical skills and irresistible violence. Throw in the romantic interest and that's about it really. However these books are written so well that the reader never gets the feeling that he is reading the same story repeatedly.<br /><br />This time round we go back to the very latter part of Reacher's army career to find out how he blotted his copybook in the eyes of the military. The last of these books I read had Reacher rather overdoing it on the analytical front and even analysing his cups of coffee - strength, stewed, cup smaller than average, bigger, thicker china than normal? However, in the Affair it is a pleasure to see Reacher much less anally retentive and really only bothering with issues which may have some bearing on what was going on - maybe he acquired these more irritating habits with age!<br /><br />When Reacher gets into a fight its a foregone conclusion whether he is up against two, four, six or really any number of opponents - you can only feel sorry for the bad guys. Similarly on the love front, this man can never fail. There was rather more of this latter aspect than strictly speaking was necessary or usual in a Reacher tale here. However, I did find the concept of using the midnight train as a marital aid innovative and quite amusing!<br /><br />To summarise, Lee Child writes these stories very well and I normally end up rating at four or five stars as they are generally very enjoyable page turners. On this one and to put it in Reacher's words. Not the best. But very good. Right up there.
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|We really appreciate having this blu-ray version of \\"Meet Me in St. Louis,\\" and one of the best things about it is the information given about the filming, etc.  It is a beautiful DVD from the standpoint of the production, great writing, great acting, and gorgeous, appropriate music.  Everyone should enjoy this one.  It's a treasure!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is very convenient to have on the kindle especially if you do a lot of writing and note taking. The keyboard is a little awkward to use, but that's to be expected, and the utility more than makes up for it. Turn autocorrect off if you plan to use it a lot.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's my favorote app. It's easy to use, has a huge selection of Bible versions. It's great I highly recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is an awesome app. its really fun and addicting. I highly recommend this app. its one of my favorites.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is enjoyable and engaging for children as well as adults.<br />Beware if you have your auto purchase settings on though, since when<br />you select to do any activity that you don't have enough coins/acorns<br />for it immediately takes you to the procurement screen.<br />My fix has been to disable internet on the Fire when playing, but that<br />also prevents using the friends site visits and video links.<br />Tech support is supposed to be addressing, but so far it's cost 20 dollars for a<br />free app.
3442217784|5.0|I actually read this long time ago when i was so board. then i introduced it to my wife and she said that it was an awesome book and a lot of good information to share to the kids.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|although the box was badly damaged I kept it. love the movie and the option for dvd or blu ray.  absolutely loved the music box and all the extras.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I'm so pleased to have found this app on Amazon's FATD. It a secure and convenient way to file my personal information.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is addictive!!  it reminds me of super Mario :-) I told all my friends about and they can't stop playing also!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so fun you will want to play until you win<br />worth it since its free probably worth three dollars. well that's all I have to say
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Upon hearing of all the fanfare about this book I ordered it and couldn't put it down. BUT i couldn't help to notice the similarities between it and A Memoir of a Love Affair (the book that the movie 9 1/2 weeks was based on). I mean they were very similar right down to the tampon scene. But I loved it anyway and can't wait to read the second book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very nice and challenging puzzles, especially if you are trying to get perfect score. Nice graphics, zen music, and all around polished game.
B0076D21O2|4.0|This movie asks a very controversial question.  What if Shakespeare didn't write the canon that bears his name?  It presents Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, the candidate du jour, as the author.  I've read countless books on this subject and think the movie does a good job of making its case.  The actors are convincing; the computer-generated landscape seems quite real.  It was hard seeing William Shakespeare turned into an immoral, possibly murderous, boob, but it IS within the realm of possibility.  Still, that could have been toned down.<br /><br />If you like literature, mystery, and period pieces, you should like this movie.  IF you want to see some of Shakespeare's plays as they may/must have been presented originally, you should like this movie.  And IF this premise is true, you'll come away from this movie feeling sad that this man never got the recognition he deserved and that a country bumpkin will live, probably forever, as the greatest writer in the English language, \\"the soul of [his and every] age.\\"<br /><br />I think it was Aristotle who said that an educated mind doesn't have to accept an idea to entertain it.  If you don't mind having your literary world turned upside down, you'll like this movie.
0345803507|5.0|I loved this series. Read all of the books in the trilogy twice! It is just as good the second time! I was very happy with the ending but wasn't ready for it to end! Probably why I re-read it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this book is a copy cat of The Twilight saga but now for 21 years and older, I can't believe this author gets away with this.<br />Badly written and much worse then I could imagine. Just bad and over priced. Sad that us Americans come to like books like these, where there are so many better book worth buying and reading.<br />Way too many connection with the other motioned books. I only read one and that was enough for me. I am a young women, yes married with 2 kids, this books is not for us \\"stay at home moms\\" I find it demeaning thinking that this book is what will \\"turn us on\\" in our boring married lives. The books is just weird.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this series. Read all of the books in the trilogy twice! It is just as good the second time!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies now and I am so glad it came in great condition. The price was also really low and that was one of the reasons I had to get it. A good buy and you will for sure be laughing throughout this movie.
0345803493|5.0|I loved this series. Read all of the books in the trilogy twice! It is just as good the second time!
B001H1UQRI|5.0|Along with many other movies, I had to buy this one because I have been dying to own it for a long time. I saw it a couple times before but I had only seen parts of it so that is why I needed to buy it and see the whole thing. It was in great condition and the price was super low so I definitely recommend anyone to buy this. And yea, his name is robert paulson.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just loved the story. It was so well written, in drew me in and kept me there. I was sorry when it finished and of course, had to have Wool 6 and the Molly Fyde books as well!<br />A story like this has been missing from sci-fi for some years. No invasion of baddies, no intergalactic fights and nothing predictable. In fact, now I know how it ends, I may well read it again.<br /> For me it is up there with Dune.<br />Thanks Hugh!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed my Bible app. I find myself longing to read it.I like to wake up in the, morning and have it to read first thing. It is certainly helping me in my journey to become a more faithful reader. I love, the daily reminders and  the ease of use.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire on my home computer. now I can play it where ever I am. it is also great that it is a free app.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|The quality and sound are very good. I hesitated a bit on getting the HD version but I'm glad I did.
B007FXLZ9K|3.0|For all the verbiage being used to describe this film, there isn't really much going on. That is not to say it doesn't hold your interest, but there is quite a bit of repetition here. Start with a dysfunctional brother and sister combo, add lots of meaningless, empty sex, an inability to achieve true intimacy with others and an implied past incestuous relationship which sort of explains all the dysfunction.<br /><br />Rinse, repeat, add a failed suicide attempt for good measure, the end. One gets the impression these 2 had quite a troubled childhood. One scene that stood out for me as a great example of the excessive nature of this film is an agonizing, long, boring, rendition of \\"New York, New York\\" delivered by the lead actress. Not a bad voice but we understand the irony of the performance almost immediately but it seems to go on for another 5 minutes beyond that.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|I bought this item as a gift, so I really don't know much about it.  But the person who received it was certainly thrilled!
B000002GYG|5.0|This CD was a gift for a friend.  That said, I already owned a copy, and gave it to him to fill a hole in his Waits collection.<br /><br />The performance is in front of a live audience.  My understanding is that Waits set up a very small venue to do the performance.  In essence this gives the effect of performing in a small club.<br /><br />The music is very nice, as is the banter between songs.  Sometimes it's difficult to tell what's banter and what's song.  That's not a criticism.  I found it charming.<br /><br />I'll acknowledge that Tom Waits isn't for everyone.  I have a very difficult time getting my wife to listen to him.  She has difficulty getting past the gravelly voice.  I compare him to someone like Dylan.  He's a singer-songwriter of widely diverse range and style.<br /><br />If you like Tom Waits, this is a great choice for your collection.  If you aren't familiar with Waits, this is also a good choice.  His remarkable sense of humor is on full display, as is his style that aligns him closely with people on the streets and hidden in the alleys.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This app is very addicting. I enjoy it a lot. It's a great way to pass the time. And it's free.
0345803507|5.0|I just finished the first book last night and I cried! I could not put this book down for 2 entire afternoons. I even ate my meals while reading.It was the most sexy, erotic book that I have ever read. I fell in love with Ana and Christian! Some parts were a little uncomfortable, but don't let that shy you away from reading it. It is the sweetest love story with a lot of humor that makes this book so great! Off to get boook 2 and 3 !!!I guess the laundry won't get done for awhile.Fantastic job EL. I can't wait to see who plays Christian in the movie!!!

B005L38QK2|1.0|Updated review: Third time is definitely NOT the charm!<br />Seeing that these were available for less than half the price they were originally, I figured that SteelSeries would have fixed the firmware update glitch that paralyzes the mouse. Unfortunately, the one I got didn't work at all except for the blinking lights, characteristic of the failed firmware bug.<br />Apparently, SteelSeries decided to repackage returned units and sell them to 3rd-Party outlets as new ones, since I didn't install any of the software and the unit stopped cold upon plugging it in. Even walking through installing the software and following SS's \\"fix\\", the mouse still doesn't work.<br />Back it goes. I feel sorry for anyone selling this broken units.<br />Buyer beware.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I confess, I didn't use many of the bells and whistles on this thing and frankly, they really don't mean anything anyway when you discover that if, like me, you try to keep your hardware drivers updated. The mouse worked fine for 4 months, then, when I noticed it was starting to act a little odd, I went to SteelSeries site for the latest software. The SteelEngine software installed fine, but while I was away from my machine, it automatically started installing the firmware update. In the middle of the update, the mouse locked up and refused to do anything but sit there and blink.<br />This is the second time I've had this happen with one of these. The first one I managed to send back to Amazon and got a replacement.<br /><br />I'm still waiting to hear back from SteelSeries so right now I'm stuck with a $70 blinking desk ornament.<br /><br />Fortunately, my two year-old Razer Deathadder still works like a charm!<br /><br />Forget SteelSeries. This was my first and last from them.
0812550706|5.0|LADIES and GENTLEMEN...Boys and Girls of All Ages...\\"<br /><br />The old Ringmaster's cry would certainly apply to this fine and outstanding book. There is something here for men and women and boys and girls of all ages.  No wonder it is read over and over again.<br /><br />Adults, young adults,and children relate to Ender, his sister Valentine and his brother Peter in different ways as they grow older. One's world view changes with age as does one's perception of truth, reality and the value and meaning of life.  This book offers new, different and deeper perspectives everytime you read it.  Like fine wine, this book gets better with age.<br /><br />For those skeptical adults who say, \\"Why would I want to read about life as seen through the eyes of a six-year old boy?\\" remember this: \\"Out of the mouths of babes\\" come truth, wisdom and understanding that we adults often miss.<br /><br />Read the book and see what I mean.<br /><br />After all, 2,400 reviewers who have given it a five-star rating can't all be wrong.  I join them is praise of this book.  Remarkable, truly remarkable. Add another five-star.

1416549447|4.0|Danny Dreyer's Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running (New York: Fireside/Simon & Schuster, 2009) is now in its second edition.  It has been acclaimed by many coaches, runners and medical professionals, as reflected in its testimonials.<br /><br />Runners suffer many injuries. As Dreyer states, \\"It is estimated that 65% of all runners incur at least one injury a a year that interrupts their training.\\" (p. 2) Although over-training can cause injury, Dreyer's lays most of the blame on bad form.<br /><br />Dreyer credits his initiation to a T'ai Chi master, Zhu Xilin. The Chinese character for \\"chi\\" can be interpreted as \\"internal energy\\" and \\"t'ai\\" as \\"extreme.\\"  Many readers will be familiar with t'ai chi as a system of self-defense without weapons that includes a series of graceful exercises. I was apprehensive that Dreyer's reference to T'ai Chi might  be just a marketing gimmick, but the author in fact does forge a compelling connection between his principles and those of T'ai Chi (and, more broadly, other martial arts). T'ai Chi, like the Japanese martial art of jiu jitsu, seeks instruction from the grace and power of animal movements.<br /><br />Dreyer incorporates several elements from T'ai Chi practice into his style. The first is meditation/relaxation. The second relates to posture. The third is mindfulness of the body.<br /><br />Meditation and relaxation can help to relax the body. It's a truism that competitive athletics is largely a mental game, and for an endurance sport like the marathon, it's even more so. Instead of stretching before a race, Dreyer recommends movements to loosen keys joints and relax the muscles.<br /><br />Pose is an important element of T'ai Chi practice. For distance running, Dreyer recommends a slightly forward posture, \\"to allow gravity to assist your forward strides.\\" I am not sure as a matter of physics that this notion of gravity assist actually makes sense. I'd rather think of the leaning posture as a more optimal angle for our muscles to transfer energy to the ground. T'ai Chi, like other Chinese martial arts, focuses particularly on strengthening and pivoting off of the dian tien, which could be translated as the Core. In this respect, Western programs such as Pilates, the Alexander Technique and classic ballet instruction parallel a much older Eastern tradition. According to Dreyer, \\"80% of all the runners I teach start off by standing with their hips too far forward and their legs sloped to the rear, their shoulders back, and their knees locked\\"; Dreyer coaches these runners to create a \\"column\\" of correct posture for running.<br /><br />\\"Mindfulness\\" runs against the doctrine, \\"No pain/no gain.\\" If your body is experiencing pain, listen to it and make adjustments. Master Zhu taught Dreyer to let the chi run through the body as \\"water runs through a pipe.\\" Adjustments, he stresses, should be incremental, using your \\"Body Sense.\\" Correct breathing is a central aspect of mindfulness.<br /><br />Dreyer recommends using minimal running shoes of the sort sort by Vibram. Because these shoes lack padding under the heals, they encourage you to strike your foot more as you would as a barefoot runner. Dreyer recommends a full strike of the foot against the surface, rather than the typical heel to ball movement of most people using conventional running shoes. He gives a simple test of good form. Run on sand. If your tracks show the full tread markings of your shoe, you've struck correctly. If you're digging wedges into the ground with your heels (see photo on p. 90), you're using a poor technique that puts unacceptable strain on your legs, including especially your knees.  By the way, if your tracks are not parallel, that implies other problems that need correction. (I run in Vibrams but follow a ball-heel-ball striking pattern. I like the shock absorbing qualities of this striking pattern. But Dreyer is right that my way puts a lot of stress on the calves, and I'm going to try out his full strike technique. One more thing: Vibrams offer very little insulation against cold, so I would put them away if running on snow or ice. As an alternative to Vibrams, you might consider a light training show, less minimal than Vibrams, but with a weight of about 8-9 ounces; be sure the heel area is not pronounced, as that is the design Dreyer says encourages a bad striking pattern.)<br /><br />Dreyer finds that many injuries result from over-elongating the gait, while keeping too slow a \\"cadence.\\" Shorter steps with a faster cadence works better, he finds, to prevent injury. He recommends a steady cadence of about 80-85 strikes per minute. In effect, if you want to run slowly, decrease your stride, not your striking rate. There are some good examples of Dreyer's notion of \\"gearing\\" in his accompanying Chi Running DVD (sold separately).<br /><br />Dreyer  has helpful advice about rotation of the pelvis along what he calls the PivotPoint, which requires twisting of the spine. Also important is getting your arm swing right--the elbow at a right angle and arms swinging parallel, not across. He cites Duke Ellington's riff: \\"It don't mean a thing/if it ain't got that swing.\\" (p. 102)<br /><br />By the way, Dreyer has just published a new book, called Chi Marathon (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, 2012). A posting by Deborah Kotz in the health blog of the Boston Globe discussed Dreyer's approach, which promises a \\"breakthrough natural running program for a pain-free half marathon and marathon.\\" . See Daily Dose, 3/26/2012. Whatever is true of running injuries in general goes double for marathons and ultra-marathons. Training injuries are almost the rule. He has also published a book and DVD on Chi Walking (New York: Fireside/Simon & Schuster, 2006).<br /><br />Mr. Dreyer manages three commercial websites related to these subjects: ChiWalking.com, ChiRunning.com and ChiLiving.com. The running Website usefully include training logs and programs.<br /><br />Dreyer Chi Running includes a series of photos of a female teacher or coach correcting a student's posture by \\"creating the column.\\" ( p.78) The photos reinforced my feeling that while reading a running book  and watching a DVD are good things, having a knowledgeable coach (perhaps someone trained by Dreyer) giving hands on feedback would be even better. In this light, I note that Dreyer offers programs to become \\"Certified Instructors\\" in Chi Running and in Chi Walking: He also offers help on his Website on finding a Certified Instructor.<br /><br />(The author of this review, Andrew Szabo, is founder of MindBodyForce.com)d I'm going to try out his full strike technique. One more thing: Vibrams offer very little insulation against cold, so I would put them away if running on snow or ice. As an alternative to Vibrams, you might consider a light training show, less minimal than Vibrams, but with a weight of about 8-9 ounces; be sure the heel area is not pronounced, as that is the design Dreyer says encourages a bad striking pattern.)<br /><br />Dreyer finds that many injuries result from over-elongating the gait, while keeping too slow a \\"cadence.\\" Shorter steps with a faster cadence works better, he finds, to prevent injury.

He cites Duke Ellington's riff: \\"It don't mean a thing/if it ain't got that swing.\\" (p. 102)<br /><br />By the way, Dreyer has just published a new book, called Chi Marathon (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, 2012). A posting by Deborah Kotz in the health blog of the Boston Globe discussed Dreyer's approach, which promises a \\"breakthrough natural running program for a pain-free half marathon and marathon.\\" . See Daily Dose, 3/26/2012. Whatever is true of running injuries in general goes double for marathons and ultra-marathons. Training injuries are almost the rule. He has also published a book and DVD on Chi Walking (New York: Fireside/Simon & Schuster, 2006).<br /><br />Mr. Dreyer manages three commercial websites related to these subjects: ChiWalking.com, ChiRunning.com and ChiLiving.com. The running Website usefully include training logs and programs.<br /><br />Dreyer Chi Running includes a series of photos of a female teacher or coach correcting a student's posture by \\"creating the column.\\" ( p.78) The photos reinforced my feeling that while reading a running book  and watching a DVD are good things, having a knowledgeable coach (perhaps someone trained by Dreyer) giving hands on feedback would be even better. In this light, I note that Dreyer offers programs to become \\"Certified Instructors\\" in Chi Running and in Chi Walking: He also offers help on his Website on finding a Certified Instructor.<br /><br />(The author of this review, Andrew Szabo, is founder of MindBodyForce.com)
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Of course the characters defy physics plenty of time and never seem to suffer serious injury, but so what? The fun of this movie is taking a break from reality. It begins with a great prison break and never lets up til the very interesting ending, which I did not see coming. It has the truly dizzying scene of Ethan scaling up the tallest building in the world and doing it very convincingly. I have heard Cruise was there doing it. Couldn't pay me enough.<br /><br />It doesn't have the charm of the first movie but it is much more energetic, and is certainly better than the prior two films, though they were entertaining in their own ways.<br /><br />If you are looking for breathless first rate action/adventure, this film does it as well as any film.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What is all the fuss about?  Some kinky sex? Whoa--who doesn't have a life??<br />Poorly written overall the only good part was the sex--but that's what it's all about, isn't it?  If it could just be condensed to the sex parts....<br />I had to put it down it was soooo boring that I actually picked up a non fiction (hard copy) book to read that I found more interesting than the tepid writing and someone's wet dream.<br />Am I buying book 2? Of course I am!!
B00756GKBA|5.0|There are several things I must address prior to delving into \\"MDNA\\". The first thing is that I was there with MTV in 1984 when \\"Borderline\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" became smash hits that year. I was there, at age 11, when she performed \\"Like A Virgin\\" at the first VMA awards, bursting out of the wedding cake and writhing on the stage (me all uncomfortable as my parents looked on). And I was there for every Madonna moment thereafter. Yet, I didn't buy an album from her until 1989's \\"Like A Prayer\\" (which I will still argue with anyone that it is her best work). I was there through \\"Truth Or Dare\\", the sex book, \\"Erotica\\" (technically her low period). So what I am getting at before I review \\"MDNA\\" is that I have always liked Madonna, but I have also remained Madonna-neutral. That means I own all of her studio albums and respect her body of work, ahem. But I am not a blind zealot or an ignorant hater. I see her flaws, her immaturity, her narcissism, but I also see her overcoming the odds that were invariably stacked against her in the music business.<br /><br />That being said, I will boldly state that \\"MDNA\\" is one of her finer moments. Let me just remind the haters that Madonna started off as dance, and she has pretty much evolved her dance to current trends over the years, and she has done that quite well. \\"MDNA\\" is no different. So, vapid, asinine, ageist criticisms are irrelevant here. Plain and simple, Madonna cranks out one of her finest, most melodic, most invigorating dance albums in a long while.<br /><br />I bought the deluxe version with the extra disc of five bonus tracks. Listening to all 17 tracks back to back there are hardly any missteps here. \\"MDNA\\" has an edge over its sister companion, 2005's \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" as \\"MDNA\\" has more attitude, tighter tracks, less late night dance club mixing. It surpasses 2008's \\"Hard Candy\\" with a more fluid, less stagnant approach. She stepped out of her comfort zone on \\"Hard Candy\\", which I respect, but ultimately came out with mixed results.<br /><br />First single \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" and second single \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" are extremely infectious dance pop confections. \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" fully captures Madonna at her guilty Catholic girl best. \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" embraces Madonna worship to its fullest. \\"Turn Up The Radio\\" is a radio friendly overcoming the mundane, at times depressing state of life. \\"Superstar\\" is Madonna sending her love out to her favorite person along with \\"Masterpiece\\". \\"I'm A Sinner\\" re-visits the guilty Catholic girl while \\"Love Spent\\" examines the exhaustion from being in a relationship. But it's her darker subject matter--\\"Gang Bang\\", \\"Some Girls\\", \\"Falling Free\\", \\"Beautiful Killer\\", \\"I F----- Up\\" and most directly and poignantly, \\"Best Friend\\" and \\"I Don't Give A\\" which all examine Madonna's feelings about past lovers (Guy Ritchie, perhaps, Sean Penn, Warren Beatty?) These tracks show a side of Madonna that is not often heard on record.<br /><br />Now, the haters can say all they want about how superficial and trite and contrived Madonna's 'self-expressions' are, and they may have some points, but you can't knock Madonna for putting down in words what sounds like the truth. After multiple listens, \\"MDNA\\" binds itself to your DNA. Catchy, melodic, with attitude, and working with several top notch dj producers and electronic maestros. All of which makes \\"MDNA\\" stand out from recent releases by Madonna. Even over 50, Madonna still has something to offer, and that's what fans want from her--something to remember.<br /><br />Here is how \\"MDNA\\" compares to Madonna's previous works:<br /><br />1983 Madonna: Three Stars<br />1984 Like A Virgin: Three and a Half Stars<br />1986 Two and a Half Stars<br />1989 Like A Prayer: Five Stars<br />1992 Erotica: Three and a Half Stars<br />1994 Bedtime Stories: Two and a Half Stars<br />1998 Ray Of Light: Five Stars<br />2000 Music: Five Stars<br />2003 American Life: Four Stars<br />2005 Confessions On ADancefloor: Four Stars<br />2008 Hard Candy: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 MDNA: Five StarsDancefloor: Four Stars<br />2008 Hard Candy: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 MDNA: Five Stars
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this game. It seems more like a game that would be on a ps3 or something rather than a kindle but its different and I like it
B003YOMNCM|5.0|Great Ms. Hahn performance, maybe for many \\"critics here\\" is a boring version, but this is a version that the public can understand, is played so beautifully. For the people who don't know, phrasing the fast and hard passages is very difficult, therefore many violinists prefer to run in this parts, but Ms. Hahn, phrase each part perfectly, and each note is perfectly well worked. My God for a violinist that is so hard, including the Profesionals.  The second movement is phrasing mit a Russian Air, I liked!!!! Remember me the classic Russian Concerts and melancholics pieces. For me is a great and well performed Concerto, if you are not sure to buy this version because the Critics, please made your own opinion, in my humble opinion, is a Wonderful Piece of Art, for your Collection.  The third movement is played in the normal tempo, \\"Fast\\" (Allegro Vivacissimo). But the introduction of the third movement is so colorful, Ms Hahn phrase the last notes with a beautiful diminuendo and a wonderful ritardando in a few long notes, then the third classic movement!!  I really enjoy this version!!!! I dont understand many critics the phrasing is wrote in the Violin Sheet, Ms. Hahn only played them perfectly und according the composer, not to the version of other violinists. The Final, the Orquesta wonderful!!!! A Perfect \\"Duo\\" between the violinist and the Orchesta, i heard both parts in perfect sonority.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|the DVD is just as good as the PBS version. Now I can replay it whenever. Thanks. It arrived within deadline.
B007IK44CK|2.0|How sad.  They took a great concept/series and reduced it to a caricature.  Bad script, bad directing, over the top, unbelievable, and just plain stupid.  Don't waste your money.  I wish Amazon would give you a refund in these cases.  I paid for this, and quite frankly, will only finish the movie because I did.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it it is just like moreo.?  but with out all the controls. and this is Akeyla not Alvien aaaaaakkkkkkkkeeeeeeyyyyyyyllllllllllllaaaaaaaa
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you should defentally get this game.  I absoulutly love it.  and I am sure you will to. if you don't to bad?
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Now I don't have to go to my mom's house to fix simple things on her computer all the time. Thanks Splashtop!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is like Mario which is cool. the controls take a little getting used to but once u get that down its fun. I am on level 5 and cant wait to c what's to come.  its so cool that the app was free and its fun
B005LAIHAE|3.0|A well traveled family has a reunion in Spain. The son, Will (Henry Cavill) is spending a lot of time on his cell phone as he just got a call his company is bankrupt. In spite of the sad violin music, they didn't bother to develop his character at this early point for me to care. Later, his brother Josh (Rafi Gavron), Dara (Emma Hamilton) and mom (Caroline Goodall) are kidnapped and ransomed. We discover Dad, Martin Shaw (Bruce Willis) is in the CIA. He and son Will must find a way to save their family in 24 hours. The kidnappers are demanding the return of a briefcase that Willis doesn't have, one that his case worker Jean Carrack (Sigourney Weaver) has already turned in.<br /><br />Yes, that would have been a great movie, except Willis doesn't get paid past the first 20 minutes and Cavill has to outrun horses and defeat the bad guys alone. So let's see, he doesn't trust the CIA. The police are after him for a murder he didn't commit. Armed with his dad's cell phone and enlisting the help of some movie eye candy (Ver&oacute;nica Echegui), Will sets out to save his family. Pretty standard stuff and then we get to the expected twist. At this juncture, the movie almost caught my interest, except that Henry Cavill never becomes convincing in this role. Instead of Henry being a stock broker, they should have made him a karate instructor, or an Olympic marksman giving him a skill he could use...No wait! He did use the cell phone.<br /><br />F-bombs. No sex or nudity. 2 1/2 stars
B0063IH60K|4.0|I installed this app on my Kindle Fire and it works fine. There are some ads, but no more than on other free apps.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|The film starts with a NASA announcement that they are sending signals to a nearby \\"Goldilocks\\" planet to see if there is any life. We then switch to a bar scene where Alex (Taylor Kitsch) is \\"celebrating\\" his birthday with his naval officer brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgård). He sees a young lady at the bar attempting to score a chicken burrito...which leads us to some comical events and then the opening credits.<br /><br />After the credits, the film jumps some undisclosed years ahead. Alex is a full lieutenant in the navy on a ship (normally takes 8-10 years to rise that high). The girl, Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) happens to be the daughter of the Fleet Admiral (Liam Neeson). They want to get married. The admiral loathes Alex because he is a gross underachiever. Everything is fun and games until...the subplots come together. At this point we can write the rest of the script. The alien ships were akin to transformers.<br /><br />I must apologize, but I enjoyed the film. The inane plot continuity issues and science was Asylum grade from beginning to end. I could be here all day writing about how absurd things were.  But unlike an Asylum film, they didn't cheat us on a soundtrack which ranged from Henry Mancini to AC/DC. We had quality actors playing likable characters with some decent lines. And no one can beat WWII vets during an AC/DC music montage.<br /><br />Think of the movie as \\"Independence Day\\" light with cheese. Good fun, good action, break out the popcorn and park your brain at the door.<br /><br />No sex, no nudity, near F-bombs.
B000024D4R|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. Item arrived fast and I listen to it almost everyday! Any Pink Floyd fan will love this CD!
B0079XNWQA|2.0|I am a big fan! Loved his last album which was a 5 star album, but this feels like lazy production and weak arrangements. The fun, the interest is all missing. A few good tracks though.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's a great game it is just that after a while it does start to get a little boring but it is still pretty fun for an app. To be honest I am pretty impressed by this game it is really fun. XD Please enjoy :) :p.
B002PQ7JQK|1.0|The blu-ray cut of this series is NOT up to standards.  You will find that the scenes in episodes will loop back and then continue making watching this very difficult.  I expect higher standards from CBS Video/Paramount when asking so much money for this product.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game it is fun really butvyou got to be able to play it every day or else moral goes way down and it is hard to get it back you there
B006OB3K56|4.0|I love this movie and I am a big fan of Michael Fassbender, but sadly this movie is not compatible with itunes. only android. :( oh well. a at least it's a good 20 bucks is a good price for the price i paid for. but fox needs to start having their movies compatible with itunes!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love all the pictures there are to work. They are Beautiful photos! I love puzzles and this for my laptop allows me to take my puzzle with me anywhere. Great fun!! I love the real life pictures. Not any of those cheezy photos. If you love working puzzles as much as I do then this game if perfect for you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very addicting. Love this game.  Want a great app. that's free; then this one is for you.  grate movies and a good clean game for kids.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|this is even better than the book in my class!!! I loooovvvee this app. ABSOLUTLY BEST PURCHASE ( of99cents) EVER!!!!!!! I WILL NEVER REGRET THIS PURCHASE!!!!!!!
B001O1Y6KY|5.0|I've been an Avenged fan since 2005 and Waking the Fallen is my favorite album. There is such a different sound to vinyl, a warmth that cds and digital copies lack. I love it. This is the very first vinyl I ever purchased and I am so happy with it. If you love Avenged Sevenfold don't hesitate, get.this.album. You will not regret it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this has more challenging levels than the normal game. very very cool. soooooooooooooooooooooooo cool. it is very fun and a very good purchase. wish the price was lower but eh.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game easy to play and very addicting and the best thing is free so you should really try it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. After I played it for a while I flounder myself wanting to play more and more. Great app to get especially for free
B002MXA7TC|5.0|I discovered The Temper Trap by hearing \\"Love Lost\\" on Pandora. I listened to a couple of their songs on youtube and liked what I heard, so I decided to buy the entire album. Good choice! Thankfully, the quality of songs like Love Lost and Sweet Disposition continue throughout.<br /><br />I'm not very good at describing sounds or making comparisons to other bands. I can only say that if you're thinking about buying this based on \\"Love Lost\\" and/or \\"Sweet Disposition\\", you won't be disappointed with the rest. All the songs are great.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I did not feel the love for this one like I did for book 1.<br /><br />Fifty was obnoxiously moody and needy. I love dark and brooding dominant heroes...but goodness, he just wore me out and not in a good way.<br /><br />I also got sick of the repetitive rhetoric... My inner goddess..well, I just hate that concept to begin with, but it must have been used a million times and I never want to hear it again. Then, there is the word beguile - using it in any form or fashion from this point forward in this series will make me throw my reader and that will just piss me off... I am not certain I will even read the final book even though I already own it.<br /><br />Peace out Fifty, it's been real...drawn out.  I believe it is worthy to note - I started this book on Sept 21, 2011... This has to be a record for me and it's a wonder I even finished it, but I am a sucker for punishment ;-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a lot of fun and a lot of different games and there are a lot of chances to get more points
B0052VUNHC|4.0|UP FOR A LOVE/HATE REALTIONSHIP STORY? THIS IS A HOLE IN ONE FOR YOU. I LOVED TO HATE THIS BOOK. IT TRULY WAS A 'BEAUTIFUL DISASTER'.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a very playable User friendly game.  reminds me of Mario brothers.  I love this game.  I recommend it to all my friends.
0060245867|5.0|The tale is amusing, as are the sketches of the little mouse, making a mess and calling for more things - as well as it all begun by just offering the little guy a cookie.<br /><br />The tale starts with a youth consuming cookies outside his home, he observes a mouse and prefers to have his cookies with him. The mouse ingests the cookie, then questions for a glass of milk, of course the kid lets him have some milk, and also the story goes on and on.<br /><br />This is an exceptional book to give as a for a present to a young person since the tale has to do with a mouse as well as a little youngster. THerefore, I think tis is such a witty account for newborns and kids.<br /><br />Most youngsters would undoubtedly enjoy this little story as well as the attractive sketches illustrating exactly how fatiguing it is to stay in touch with this easily-distracted mouse, that goes from task to endeavor, leaving a trail of mess behind him.<br /><br />All in all, this is a genuine classic like I think this one will be too, so Ill recommend it as well [[ASIN:B007VH5KVO Have you spotted the White Squirrel? (Rare Animale Series)]]
B0061S0A64|3.0|the side bar in which you get the nodes is quite small. So it always registers it as a piano tap rather than getting a node out. Also it crashes when there are about 30 nodes out. Samsung Galaxy Nexus
B0013TTLDE|2.0|While I am usually a fan of Period Books, I found this one very confusing with flashbacks here and there, with little or no warning, that tended to confuse rather than inspire.  It has been a slow and plodding read.
B007MC868M|5.0|With mother rat's consent, there may be even more to this complex story than even appears.  After several brilliant reviews of this work, it is difficult to say much more than the fact that Jo Nesbo is writing the best \\"detective\\" stories than anyone else is writing in any language.  Thrillers, yes.  Novels, absolutely.  Complex to the point that the reader wonders how Nesbo can construct such compelling reads that are as rich in psychology, emotions, police procedurals as they are in reading pleasure.  It will be hard for him to outdo this fine work.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|this is kinda funny to play with. what more can be said download it play it if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is one of the best games ever! it cost alot but worth it. i have been a fan of angrybirds for a long time and can say this is the best one yet
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am very happy with this app.  I've had it on my phone for quite awhile and it's been a very handy resource and now using on my Kindle Fire it's helping me keep up on my daily reading of the Word especially the reading plans that are available.
