B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game is stunning. First of all I would recommend checking out the free version to make sure you like it. But don't be scared off, the game seems very complex at first, but it takes very little time to get used to it. This game is very much so open to different styles of professions and courses of action. It can be enjoyed by nearly anyone. check it out.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Best seller? Seriously? First of all I really don't like leaving negative comments but I am so disappointed that I purchased this poorly written & annoying book. I tried to get though it, but it just kept droning on...It was time to put it out of its misery..I deleted it.

0385736002|4.0|You know, you can divide these middle grade fantasy/quest books into at least three categories. There are books that retell, in modern guise, well worn old tales. I'm thinking here of retellings of the Arthur stories. Some of these, (like Susan Cooper's \\"Dark is Rising\\" series), are great on their own. Some, like just about any book that throws in a magician named Merlin to save the plot, are pretty lame and just passing.  Another line of stories make everything up from scratch. You get a lot of made up entities with made up powers that have made up motivations to do unspeakable made up things. That's fine too, but for every made up world that engages you there are a dozen made up worlds that just exist to allow the author to wander around without having to be any more rigorous than deciding where to hide the magic swords.<br /><br />  This book falls into the third group, the everything in the pot survey collections. Some have some organizing theme - Percy Jackson's Greek and Roman gods, Neil Gaiman's Norse gods, Jenny Nimmo's Welsh legendary heroes - but lots of them have a \\"more the merrier\\" approach. That's where this book fits. Medieval mystic beings, Egyptian gods, Irish Gods, Greek gods - they're all in here. And you know what? It is the more the merrier. There is enough plot and there is enough weight to the main characters and villains that the action - chases, traps, imprisonments, sieges, attacks, chases - works, and the story stays on track. No wonder these books are popular, and good for you too.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is truly the most amazing series I have ever read. It is truly addictive. I could not put these books down! While it is true that there is definitely sex involved, the characters in this story really make the storyline interesting. You never know what is next. I personally liked this book best in the series. I read this book in one day because I could not stop reading. It is that good.  I purchased the books for $9.00 on amazon and would have paid double they are so addicting.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|\\"My Week With Marilyn\\" is a bittersweet look into a young man's amazing encounter with the woman who defined stardom in the 1950s and early 1960s, and held millions of people in thrall from the silver screen. Colin Clark's true-life tale of his time working as a 3rd Assistant Director (i.e., a \\"go-fer\\") on the production of Sir Laurence Olivier's 1957 film, \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\", is a charming, understated recreation of Clark's experiences during a few weeks in 1956, during which time he briefly became a member of Marilyn Monroe's inner circle.<br /><br />Marilyn was, by all accounts, a fragile and insecure woman, and arrived in England for filming surrounded by an entourage (though small by today's media-darling standards) who tended her - and controlled her, to a certain extent. The 23-year-old Clark, in his position assisting Olivier, was often called on to get Monroe to the movie set on time and run errands for her as well as Olivier. It was in this capacity that he caught Marilyn's eye. As difficult as it may be to believe the events that unfold, as Marilyn takes Colin into her confidence, the film sells them with a charming, low-key approach.<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne plays Colin Clark with just the right amount of wide-eyed naivet&eacute; maturing into an increasing worldliness. Michelle Williams as Monroe is, in a word, magnificent. She captures Marilyn's beauty, fragility, and insecurity amazingly well, and is at her best, I think, when portraying Marilyn at her ease - whether charming young Clark during a day of playing \\"hooky\\" to see the sights in the English countryside, or lighting up with an impromptu star turn for admiring young Etonians or the staff at Windsor Castle during an unscheduled visit.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh is quite believable as Olivier, and the ironic juxtaposition of Branagh portraying the man whose career footsteps he has shadowed won't be lost on the viewer who is at all familiar with their two careers. Dame Judi Dench is delightful as Lady Sybil Thorndike, the septuagenarian actress who portrayed the Queen Dowager to Olivier's Prince Regent in the film, providing a supportive counterpoint to Branagh/Olivier's frustration and exasperation with Marilyn's tardiness and insecurity. Emma Watson, of \\"Harry Potter\\" fame, is charming in a small role as a junior wardrobe mistress with whom Colin Clark has a brief relationship before being drawn into Marilyn's orbit - the role is a foreshadowing of the great things to come, post-Potter, for Miss Watson.<br /><br />Visually beautiful, and true to period in setting & wardrobe, \\"My Week With Marilyn\\" is a treat.tful as Lady Sybil Thorndike, the septuagenarian actress who portrayed the Queen Dowager to Olivier's Prince Regent in the film, providing a supportive counterpoint to Branagh/Olivier's frustration and exasperation with Marilyn's tardiness and insecurity. Emma Watson, of \\"Harry Potter\\" fame, is charming in a small role as a junior wardrobe mistress with whom Colin Clark has a brief relationship before being drawn into Marilyn's orbit - the role is a foreshadowing of the great things to come, post-Potter, for Miss Watson.<br /><br />Visually beautiful, and true to period in setting & wardrobe, \\"My Week With Marilyn\\" is a treat.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|This album is much better than I expected. I'd been putting off buying it since I saw in theaters, but once I got the DVD I had to get the music too.  I've really enjoyed it & can picture the scenes easily as I drive.

B0051T47NQ|4.0|While making a documentary film about illegal bear hunting in Norway, three students of Volda University College - Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna Mørck) and Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen) - encounter a strange man named Hans (Otto Jespersen), who, they suspect, might be involved in the on-going case of mysterious bear killings.<br /><br />The glum-looking man Hans, as it turns out, has been secreting hunting trolls deep in the Norwegian woods and mountains. Yes, the film's premise is admittedly silly, but it works with a slightly tongue in cheek approach to the subject matter.<br /><br />At first sight \\"The Troll Hunter\\" may look like a cross of \\"Cloverfield\\" and \\"Blair Witch Project,\\" but as the story unfolds, you will notice the film's \\"Men in Black\\"-type humor - the titular character taking his \\"job\\" very seriously, for example. Hans trying to take a blood sample from a troll, clad in his hand-made armored suit, is something very unique.<br /><br />The film is often spooky, if not very scary, with special effects that are varied in quality. \\"The Troll Hunter\\" also benefits from the beautiful landscapes of Norway that are cleverly used as the backdrop of the incredible story.<br /><br />It seems the Norwegian film has many cultural references (including the brief end credit music \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" by Edvard Grieg). Even if you don't know much about the Norwegian culture, especially its folklore, like me, you can enjoy the dark comedy fantasy.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|This movie was really good.  A different take on the \\"creature movie\\", courtesy of Scandinavia.  Appreciate it for the differences that make it refreshing.  The trolls are pretty damn cool.  We need more movies like this in america.  A breath of fresh (and entertaining) air!

0763644765|5.0|I bought this for my 2-year-old son. He LOVES this book! He refuses to sit on the potty without it, and if it's not there when he sits down, he goes around the house calling out for it. \\"Book? Book?\\" Anyway, we've read this book so much that all I have to do now is hand it to him and he \\"reads\\" it to me. This book really helped him understand the concept of the potty. He's looking forward to getting his very own undies! This is a great book and we really love it!

B007M6P01O|4.0|I really liked this episode. Plenty of action, and Rick finally stood up for himself like he should have done a long time ago.  But can I say that I totally hate Lori??? She is totally bi-polar and crazy. One minute she is practically telling Rick to eliminate Shane, the next she is basically opening things up with Shane again and telling him the baby could be his.  WTH????  Anyway, she needs to go. And Carl is just stupid. I am not usually for any violence against kids, but he needs to be the next to get eaten for sure. And Carol??? BLECHHHH!!!!!  Annoying! I really like Daryl, Herschel, and Andrea in this episode. I've always liked Glenn, but he is just sort of there now, not really doing anything for the group. He and Maggie have their love fest now so we shall see how that goes.... Beth also adds nothing, and T-Dogg has been sort of used as a grunt, so I don't blame him for wanting to leave, although I think he is helpful as man-power.... All in all, the episode was cool. I like how it showed how this herd formed and made its way to the farm....

B001E45XT4|1.0|Good headphones.  Unfortunately, the mic stopped working on the second day of use.  Got it replaced under warranty with no hassle.  Received a new headset, and the mic stopped working again after a day of use.  Not worth the trouble of getting a third.  Get another headset if you need to communicate with people.  If you just want headphones, these will do.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Will this movie ever make a top ten for artistic flair?  Most likely not.  But if your in the mood to just be entertained this is a great choice.  The film stars many of the guys you remember from the 80's and 90's, a few of the newer ones (Jason Statham stole the show in the movie imo), lots of action, fire fights, and explosions and some humor in parts.  Already looking forward to the second one and seeing some of the people that were left out (Norris, Van Damme) and how their characters are going to inter mingle with those that were established in this one.
B006Z2WE0G|3.0|I had no idea what this book was about - just that friends had read it an it had an intriguing title.  Then when I was about to sit down to start it, the concept sounded good.  I started on a Friday afternoon and read non-stop through the first half.  I LOVED it.  I had no idea about the history, and was gripped and horrified by the compelling story, wonderfully told, of Sarah and her life.<br /><br />But then the interwoven story of the journalist who I never really cared about became more and more the focus.  As the book wore one, it got slower and slower and Sarah's piece seemed to fade.  The story about the journalist, her husband, her daughter, her sister, her life was never very interesting to me...it felt like a very light story juxtaposed with the complex, stunning story of the life of Sarah.  So I have a \\"5\\" rating for the Sarah piece, and a \\"1\\" for the other.  Averages to a \\"3\\"....but don't take the \\"3\\" as a reason to stay away.  The history of the Vel d'Hiv is amazing, horrifying, and important.  And Sarah's story will stay with you for a very very long time.

1451648537|4.0|It would have been nice to have been able to title this \\"An Amazing Man, An Amazing Bio\\", but although I love Isaacson and have read his other biographies, I don't think he hit this one out of the park.  It could be because, like many of the other reviewers, I feel some connection to Steve Jobs.  I remember his visit to Polaroid to meet with Edwin Land, seeing him entering \\"the lab\\" and hearing about his use of the \\"Intersection of Science and Humanity\\" - a clear reflection of Land's \\"the Intersection of Art and Science\\".<br /><br />The book, despite its length, is a compelling and fast read.  But you are left with so many questions.  The details are presented well, but without background.  So you understand that he bought a unique home, and that he eventually let it go because he didn't want or need it.  But why he was drawn to it and why he let it go is left alone.  Even business things.....how did he ever get ATT to agree to his terms with the iPhone?  That was a genious move on par with his move on iTunes, but it isn't described.  How was that negotiation with ATT done?? Many many interesting annecdotes bring  you into Apple, NEXT and Pixar, and into his life at points, but it is uneven and probably suffers from being too \\"close.\\"<br /><br />It was a privledge to see a genious evolve.  Having several in the same lifetime was an honor.  Thanks to Walter Isaacson for his portrayal.  Perhaps some time needs to pass for the next author to take Isaccson's good start to the next level.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This really is a sleeper movie. A visual treat and a great story to Boot. I will not go into the Movie Review aspect as there are enough here. I will say give this movie a chance. I was channel surfing and came into this movie with low expectations. What I came away with was a thought provoking, mind blowing, visual feast. The movie touches on child abuse, insanity, mortality, eternity, life, death and everything in between. In other words its a movie about the power of the mind. Reminds me of the first time I saw Dark City which I've seen 10+ times since. I absolutely cannot wait to watch this one again. How people can give this gem a 2 or 3 Star rating is beyond me. The movie is so complex and well thought out it I am still beside myself...Seriously...do not miss this one.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game gives weeks of enjoyment. Yes it is challenging, but once one figures out how to move from scene to scene it is very clever. I admit needing some help from time to time, but ironically my little grandchild flew thru the game with wonder and amazing skill. Well done and I look forward to more games like this!
B00351YF52|5.0|I have read \\"The Broker\\" several times just like any other John Grisham novels and it never fails to feed my imagination and love for novels and other books. John Grisham is one of the best. The thrill and suspense is just awesome.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I love adventure and puzzle games but this one was disappointing. The mansion had only a few rooms to explore and even fewer items to find and use. If you get stuck and can't find the next item, the game cannot progress. Not fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although the writing was a bit simple, I won't hold it against the book for two reasons: (1) because it's supposedly marketed as \\"juvenile fiction\\" to begin with; and (2) the story is so interesting, different, fast-paced, and exciting that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />That said, though, there *are* still a couple of detriments. One is the minor predictability of the plot. Granted, it was still exciting, as I mentioned, but it still could have been at least a little more intricate and unpredictable. Also, I thought that the ending, while not a cliffhanger in the least, still could've used a bit more closure. Yes, I realize that this is the first book of a trilogy, but I still like a *slightly* more \\"closed\\" ending--even in a trilogy.<br /><br />But, again, even with those negatives, the book still blew me away and although I would probably give it 4 stars in a vacuum, I will still give it the full 5 stars taking into account its genre and the fact that it's part of a trilogy.<br /><br />In any case, it's such a quick read that I can't imagine anyone at all being disappointed in it!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|\\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" is great feel good film.  I found it to be quite captivating and am very glad that I made the effort to see it.  I recommend it to others.<br /><br />In brief, the film revolves around the coming together of seven elderly and somewhat impecunious Britons who, of their own volition, and quite separately, decide to retire to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur.  They discovered the place on the internet and, as we all should know, the internet can sometimes be a bit misleading.  Indeed, this is the case here.  The hotel had been billed as a marvelous palace when, in fact, it was tired and chaotic.<br /><br />The seven visitors form the key members of the cast and are led by Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy.  Some can adjust to the way of life in India while others fail completely.  Along the way, we are given a peek into daily life in India in all its colour and noise.<br /><br />The movie is often funny but always enthralling.  I will say no more as to the plot.  I have no wish to spoil this film for others. However, I will say that it is money and time very well spent.
B005OK81HA|4.0|This is an album for die-hard fans. For those of us that were sad to learn that Sting In The Tail was to be the last new music from our German rockers. They re-do a bunch of classic tunes and the results are pretty good. It sounds professionally produced, with rich guitars and clean vocals. My fave has to be the album opener, Rhythm Of Love. Still powerful, maybe has more balls now? I don't know, a lot of times when bands re-work their old material it is a cheap cash grab. Not this time.<br /><br />The six new cover songs the Scorps offer here are pretty interesting. Not the \\"normal\\" selection (I.E. boring same old)bands usually cover. Some old tunes done with class. Klause really shines on Tin Soldier and Ruby Tuesday. I would totally love for these boys to continue. Thanks for the incredible music for the last 40 years. You will be missed.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read one of the original versions of this trilogy. How do I know that? It had numerous typos or poor editing. However, I spent 1 week reading (also going to work)  the books. Did I love the characters? No. Would I want to live like this? No. Is this the first BDSM book I have ever read? No. Yet I was captivated by it; I wanted to know how it would end.

B001GSV3EC|2.0|Beck is pretty much a living God, but I'm seriously pissed that the CD omits ALL of the collaborations - those with Joss Stone, Imogen Heap (in spite of Amazon's video image here implying it isn't), and Eric Clapton. Almost the entire 3rd menu from the DVD is missing here.<br /><br />I sure wish the stupid, greedy people running what's left of the recording industry would get their act together. Ridiculous that I have the intellectual property, and product on the DVD, but can't buy it on the CD. Can you imagine the outrage if Microsoft tried to charge everyone for a piece of software all over again every time it moved to a different piece of media? This has been the RIAA's strategy for 50 yrs now. Outrageous and retarded.<br /><br />Don't bother wasting your money here. Just get the BluRay, and rip it to MP3. It really is an epic performance. Too bad you can't buy it on the CD.

B006UG90RM|5.0|This album delivers.  David Lee Roth is a kick ass song writer and Eddie backs it all up with tasty licks and amazing tones.  It's kind of a mix of classic Van Halen with something new and modern.  I especially liked Tattoo, Stay Frosty, Beats Workin, You and Your Blues, and She's the Women.  Not one dud in the magazine.  Now I realize what Van Halen has been missing all these years since the break up in 1984.  It was definitely missing David Lee's tone, song writing and attitude.  Too bad it took over 25 years to get back to the original formula, that mojo that made them famous in the first place.  I just hope they follow up with another bulls eye no matter how long it takes.

B0062KMDZ2|1.0|I bought this as a blind purchase based on the great reviews on Amazon.  What a disappointment.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It's neither fun nor funny.  It's simply boring.  Yes, it has some good 3D effects, but that alone doesn't save the film or justify its high price.  $43 for one blu-ray? Seriously? Thank goodness I bought it elsewhere for less.  I'm giving it one star to balance out the ridiculous 5-star ratings.
0385534639|2.0|Erin Morgenstern has some fantastic writing talents on display in The Night Circus. She can set a scene that makes the reader feel they're right there, seeing the arrows flying into the fire, seeming to change its colors. Items are described with such care that it's easy to imagine them in the real word, just as wondrous as on paper. I truly wanted to see the real life version of the huge clock.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't read books just for scene setting and lovingly described artifacts; I read for characters and plot. And I just couldn't bring myself to care about either. As they age, there are snapshots from the characters' lives but it's not enough to make them compelling. Yes, the upbringings of Celia and Marco are sad - but the way it is addressed seems like the author is trying to find a fast, easy method to make them more sympathetic instead of developing the characters. 'The Game' is referenced obliquely, in ways that try to invoke some suspense or mystery - and fail.<br /><br />I sincerely disliked the format. It might seem like a silly thing, but I don't have the attention span of a rabid weasel and chapters with 1-3 pages on average make me feel like I'm reading the script for a soap opera episode. Time flips back and forth without evident reason.<br /><br />In short, The Night Circus quickly became a chore to read and I suggest looking elsewhere for an interesting book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|the game is fun because you get into it and start to want to make it the best but all the tapping gets frustrating.

B006YC74E8|5.0|If you want to add stupid cartoon clip art to your pics, or a million goofy frame options, this is not for you. This is a photo editor that actually edits photos. All the adjustments you need to make your pics look better are here and are easy to use. And it's small too. This will get alot of use on my tablet.
B004LROMQG|5.0|Very engaging series.  I enjoy watching this series along with my kids.  What I like most about this series (all 3 seasons) is that you don't see the blood and gore when violence is committed.  They leave that up to our very capable imaginations.  Also, there are no sex scenes or swearing.  This allows me to let my kids watch it.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|This game stinks u cant get past one level. its a waist of my time I would rather eat bon bone all day its horrible angry birds just gets more boring when they come out with new ones don't get it

0375842209|5.0|I'm not even going to write a summary of this book because I cannot adequately describe the story - it's more of an experience. It's been a very, very long time since I've wept reading a book. Zusak uses color, music, shock, and humor all against the backdrop of War World II's holocaust. The narrator of the story is the angel of death himself which makes the story that much more haunting.<br /><br />Story-telling at it's very, very best. Ironically, one of the major themes thread throughout the book is the power of words, yet I find myself unable to express what I loved about this book. Zusak creates richly developed characters which you can't help but fall in love with despite their flaws. The Papa - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE him!!<br /><br />I couldn't put it down once I started. Just, read it!!
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I don't remember ever downloading this movie. I will not watch it because I do not watch rated R movies. Where did it<br />come from. I must call them.
076790592X|4.0|This book is an autobiographical account of a loving relationship between the author, Mitch Albom and his teacher, mentor, and life-coach - Morrie. Mitch is reunited with his old College professor when he finds out (through a Nightline exclusive), that Morrie has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) and is dying. Mitch and Morrie meet every Tuesday where Morrie continues to teach Mitch life lessons on topics such as love, death, and relationships as Mitch witnesses Morrie's deteriorating health.<br /><br />This book is so beautifully written. We are taken along with the author on an emotional rollercoast and along with the author, we soak up Morrie's words of wisdom as he teaches his final lessons. Anybody who reads this book will walk away with something and will reflect on their own life and how Morrie's words are relevant to them. These are all lessons we should hear and incorporate into our own lives.<br /><br />I really loved this book and will definitely read Mitch Albom's other book The Five People You Meet in Heaven. I do have one little thing that had me raising my eyebrows. When describing his perfect day, Morrie failed to mention his family. He speaks about how important it is to get married and have children; also stressing the importance of family relationships. However, he omits his family entirely when describing his perfect day. And I know Mitch states that what was so beautiful about Morrie's day was its very simplicity, but it would have been just as easy to say \\"have tea with my wife Charlotte\\". That part just seems inconsistent.<br /><br />But, at the end of the day, I highly recommend this book - the messages are too important.
B007JUWM64|3.0|Overall I liked the movie and was happy with it.  I think a lot of this lends to the actors playing the endearing roles of the musketeers.  All parts of the movie were ok with nothing standing out particularly strongly.  The action sequences were good with not too many cuts.  Mainly, there were a lot of fantastical moments that came across as slightly far-fetched.  But it you are ok with taking things as you seem them, you should give this a watch.

B004IWR06S|5.0|Clint Eastwood is today by far the best American film maker. During the last 30 years plus he has progressed in his film style, camera work and editing, to the point of being easily recognizable.<br /><br />Hereafter is based on a solid screenplay and competent performers, It does not question or justify the so called after life. In fact, the whole film is about change, and how it is sometimes so needed in order to survive.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is well done and in my opinion needed to be included in anyone's collection. Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|many mini games to play. I like that the more u play the more games you get. I like that my son can play too.
0785135863|5.0|I've read all the graphic novel adaptations of Orson Scott Card's novels.  This is by far the best one.  While it's hard to condense a 300+ page novel into a 75-page comic book --some interesting elements have to be jettisoned--this adaptation flows very smoothly and I never felt like I was missing vital information or background on the characters.  The script writer and artist avoided the problems that plagued adaptations of Wyrms (too much information rushed and glossed over), and Ender in Exile (whole subplots omitted).  The artwork was clear and evocative, never confusing.  If I had not already read the novel, if this was my first and only exposure to Speaker for the Dead, I would have certainly felt this was a complete and wholly realized story in comic form.
B0079NQZLE|1.0|Adults murdering children set such a dark theme to this movie I could not watch any further than a few minutes.  Maybe the movie gets better but I have no desire to discover it's value.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|Tintin, a young Belgian journalist, is drawn into a web of intrigue and deception when he buys a model of a ship called the Unicorn. At least two groups take an interest in the model and Tintin finds himself shot at and his flat burgled. Sensing a possible story, Tintin pursues the mystery of the Unicorn across multiple countries and continents to its surprising and unexpected conclusion.<br /><br />The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is a motion-captured animated movie directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson. An enormous amount of creative firepower has been brought to bear on bringing Belgian cartoonist Hergé's characters to life. It was a bit of a gamble by Spielberg and Jackson, as the Tintin albums (graphic novels) are immensely successful worldwide but are relatively little-known in the United States. Making use of this fact, the movie was released in Europe several weeks prior to its American release, building up a good word-of-mouth that boosted the film's success in the States (and leading to a sequel being put into development).<br /><br />I was a major Tintin fan as a child, collecting quite a few of the albums and watching the animated TV series. I was interested to see what Spielberg and Jackson could produce, but was also a little worried. Early trailers seemed to show an artistic style reminiscent of the 'uncanny valley'-stricken Polar Express (where the almost-human-looking characters are off-puttingly fake). Fortunately, the finished film is mostly a success, avoiding most of the pitfalls of CGI movies that try to stick too closely to realism. The animation is jaw-dropping, whether it's depicting an action-packed, one-shot motorcycle chase through a Middle-Eastern city, a battle between duelling shipyard cranes or a running gunfight on a ship at night. For the most part the characters are given animation and life, with a slightly stylised art style used that falls between realism and outright cartoons. The 'uncanny valley' issue remains in small doses, and is a particular problem with Tintin himself. Like his comic counterpart, the film's Tintin is a little on the bland side with few defining characteristics aside from his stoic heroism and determination. Luckily, his more colourful and interesting companion characters (most notably Captain Haddock, whom, as in the albums, steals most of the scenes he's in) more than make up for this lack.<br /><br />As well as the successful animation, the movie is backed up by a strong, pacy script. Co-written by current Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat and British comedy directors Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim) and Joe Cornish (Attack the Block), the script draws on storylines from three of the albums: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure (probably among the best-known and apparently the biggest-selling of the albums). The writers pack a huge amount of incident into the film's 110 minutes, but ably move between moments of characterisation, comedy and action without making the film feel too busy or short. Spielberg's direction is also impressive, particularly the aforementioned tracking shot depicting a motorcycle chase through a bustling city, which is much more successful than Spielberg's previous attempts to do long one-shots. A sequence in which Haddock recalls the adventures of his ancestor and mixes present-day shots of the desert and flashes back to a raging sea battle is also highly engaging.<br /><br />Rounding off the film's success is the voice acting. Andy Serkis (best-known as Gollum from Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies) is great as Captain Haddock, imbuing him with comedy and pathos as needed. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Thompson and Thomson are also amusing, whilst Daniel Craig is superbly menacing as the film's primary villain, Ivan Sakharine. Jamie Bell does a good job with Tintin, but is not given a huge amount to work with.<br /><br />Overall, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (****½) is a highly successful adaptation of Hergé's characters and stories. The film is funny, dramatic, exciting and fast-paced, easily Spielberg's best work in a decade and hugely outstripping the terrible Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as a rollicking adventure movie. Where problems emerge are a few (mercifully short) sequences where uncanny valley-itis sets in and the issues of Tintin not being a terribly engaging protagonist. But with its excellent voice acting, awesome visuals and well-paced script, the movie overcomes these problems with ease. The film is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray). I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version for its superior visual quality. This is one film which really deserves to be seen in as high quality as possible.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|I'm holding out for when Robert Downey, Jr. takes on the role of Louis Pasteur or maybe Lawrence Welk, just to see how he twists them to suit his insouciant temperament. There are folks out there raking Downey, Jr. over the coals because, by gum, dude is not playing the Great Detective in the manner done by Rathbone or Brett or currently being done by Cumberbatch. I love Sherlock Holmes. But I'm also a proponent of slaying sacred cows when appropriate. In my eyes, what Robert Downey, Jr. brings to the table supplants all fuddy-duddies and their disgruntled harrumphs. SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS is ridiculous, yes. Ridiculously entertaining.<br /><br />If you're anticipating a cerebral armchair detective, brother, you must not have seen 2009's SHERLOCK HOLMES. This Holmes is cerebral AND scruffier AND decidedly a man of action, this last bit referenced by A. Conan Doyle in SIGN OF FOUR, but an aspect which most folks have glossed over. Holmes, canonically, is a bare knuckles amateur pugilist, as well as a student of the martial arts of baritsu (or bartitsu). It's this physicality which director Guy Ritchie chooses to emphasize. Maybe the coolest gimmick in the first film is Holmes' application of his deductive powers to predict an opponent's next move in a scrap. We see him visualizing his counter-moves and then executing them. Ritchie takes this gimmick and extrapolates to wonderful effect.<br /><br />In the first film, Holmes' archnemesis was merely a figure in the shadows, puppeteering events. In this sequel, Professor James Moriarty comes to the fore, and Ritchie knew better than to eff with the Holmes-Moriarty dynamics. If ever there was a match for Holmes' dazzling intellect, it's this daytime Oxford don's. Whispered in certain circles as \\"the Napoleon of Crime,\\" Moriarty has felt Holmes nipping at his heels, here and there putting a dent in his criminal empire. Jared Harris is a stark contrast to Downey, Jr. Whereas Downey, Jr.'s Holmes can be at times jittery and often airily impudent, Harris' Moriarty is composed and self-assured in his power and influence. You don't get a better sense of this than in the scene in which he and Irene Adler are dining in a restaurant, a venue Irene Adler had selected for its very public (and, therefore, safe) atmosphere. But, it turns out, not so safe, as the professor proceeds to chillingly demonstrate his reach. The big bad is so formidable and time and again stumps Holmes so effortlessly that the detective is forced to compliment him: \\"My horror at your crimes is matched only by my admiration at the skill it took to achieve them.\\"<br /><br />The story indulges in a bit of globe-hopping as the chase leads Holmes and company from a fully-realized Victorian London to Paris to Germany to Switzerland. I will say that the plot is tortuous and torturous. In a nutshell, Moriarty is working towards destabilizing the western civilization, trying to push the nations into war. Moriarty, owner of a gigantic munitions factory, then stands to profit. Sherlock Holmes, in his stand against Moriarty, faces anarchist bombers, acrobatic Cossack assassins, exploding trains, collapsing edifices, and having to ride a horse. To help whittle down Moriarty's minions, Holmes recruits a gypsy fortune teller (Noomi Rapace) and his big brother Mycroft (a delightfully sly Stephen Fry). And, of course, Doctor Watson.<br /><br />Proving that it wasn't a one-time thing, Downey, Jr. and Jude Law exert that same marvelous chemistry. These guys just play off each other perfectly. Again, it's gratifying to have a Dr. Watson who isn't a lapdog. Watson, in fact, tends to roll his eyes at Holmes' excesses. Jude Law lends Watson resolve and big brassy huevos; I love that the good doctor - who, if one recalls, is a war veteran - is just as handy in a tight spot as Holmes is. And to demonstrate that Holmes holds his Boswell in deep esteem, even in the brains department, he relies on Watson to apply his own observationalskills to prevent an assassination. It must be noted that Watson agrees to sidekick duties once again, albeit reluctantly, having just gotten married to Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). This says something of Holmes' persuasiveness, especially since ***SPOILERS FOR THE REST OF THIS SENTENCE*** he'd just tossed Watson's wife off the train.<br /><br />Guy Ritchie, flash director, comes with full artillery, splashing nonstop bombast on the screen. We again note his fondness for the slo-mo and the speed ramping, except that he uses these techniques to very good effect. I love the action set pieces, the best of which may be the amazing battle on the honeymoon train. Only Holmes and Moriarty's brilliant final confrontation over Reichenbach Falls tops that sequence. Robert Downey, Jr. anchors a good cast (except for Rachel McAdams whose performance of an uncharacteristically dim Irene Adler made my teeth grind). No one else can pull off what Downey's doing with Holmes. Any other actor, and chances are, I'd be out there, too, with tar and feather. Yes, it's a smudge on the old Sherlockian establishment but, for me, in the end, star power and charisma and sheer likability win out, even if sometimes the banter seems forced and some of the jokes come on too obvious (Holmes' observation that \\"It's so overt, it's covert.\\" seems like levity trying too hard). I love what Cumberbatch is doing with his BBC show. But I also like what I see on the other end of the spectrum. And I don't think Cumberbatch, wicked brilliant as he is, can play a chair as convincingly.skills to prevent an assassination.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This I love!  It's very versatile, serving as a cover, stand, and holder (the strap might be my favorite part, as it gives me extra security when the Kindle Fire is in hand).  The shell that actually holds the Kindle Fire seems strong and shock-resistant, while the thin rubberized cover protects the screen without being bulky and cumbersome. Its slim design allows me to carry my Kindle Fire everywhere -- without taking up a lot of room in my bag, or requiring a lot of room to use it when it I get there.
0062513346|2.0|There were times while I was reading this book that the things he wrote spoke to things that I had felt so well that I started underlining them.  Other parts I was so confused and really disturbed by the things that were written (and in a way that condoned the same) that I really wished I had never started reading.<br /><br />It talks in depth about making a pact with yourself to fail when success is within reach.  I see that in myself.  Not so much a fear of failure but a lot of fear of success too.  So I liked hearing that idea mentioned.  The struggle to feel at peace with what you have achieved or to feel at peace with achievement in general.<br /><br />At one point a group that he is traveling with \\"the valkyries\\" starts up a sidewalk show where they are preaching to passersby telling them to be true to their hearts and follow their dreams. Some of the people object that they have obligations and families that tethered them to the lives that they were living.  One of the characters \\"Valhalla\\" says that family never kept anyone from living their dream.  As I read that I thought \\"wow that's awesome, we shouldn't just sit back and excuse ourselves from doing what we love because we have obligations.  We should do them anyway, even especially because of our families.  kinda like \\"Set the example for those we love\\" that we can still follow our hearts even when our hearts are knit together with those around us.  Like \\"hey don't puss out and live a wo-is-me life cause you got \\"bogged down\\" with responsibilities.  Find a happy medium or just recognize that your family should feel like your great work and highest achievement.<br /><br />Then further on in the reading it is revealed that the same character \\"followed her heart\\" by abandoning her husband and two children to sleep with high rollers at casinos for money to support her biker gang.  So.... yeah I guess i felt like either I wasn't getting the message or the message was just a bunch of \\"if it feels good do it\\" B.S.  \\"Take no thought for how your actions will affect those around you in the end your only really responsible for yourself\\".<br /><br />Honestly after reading the Alchemist I was excited to read this but if this is really the way the author feels then I feel sorry for him.  He's not only confused but he's propagating that confusion to millions.  It's like mixing 75% awesomeness with 25% dog S#!+ and expecting the people eating to just smile and wolf it down like gravy train..S.  \\"Take no thought for how your actions will affect those around you in the end your only really responsible for yourself\\".<br /><br />Honestly after reading the Alchemist I was excited to read this but if this is really the way the author feels then I feel sorry for him.

B0009PAVI2|5.0|I use this case to store three circular polarizers for my DSLR kit - a 67mm, 72mm, 77mm. The case is well padded which gives me some peace of mind about the expensive filters inside not getting damaged. The front flap is secured with a buckle and velcro minimizing the chance of dropping a filter. It is also equipped with a belt loop which uses both a button snap and velcro for closure and you do not have to take off your belt to use it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|When I first got my Kindle Fire, birds was the first game I downloaded. I enjoyed the game for really long time. I bought the free version which isn't ad-free so the adds in the corner get distracting. So after having my device for awhile and having the game for awhile I don't play it that often because it gets boring after awhile and there are better games out there.

1843106698|5.0|I was not diagnosed until late in middle-age and only after I was searching for answers to my son's difficulties. I recognized so much of myself, but even more of my child, in this book and about a year later, received an official diagnosis.<br /><br />The author's point about how girls, in particular, go undiagnosed due to higher vocabulary and coping skills was spot on.<br /><br />No two people with Aspergers are the exact same. One of my major frustrations in life has always been that I simply don't easily grasp or speak in subtleties. I say what I mean and mean what I say, yet there are people who will read something more into it than what was intended, because their own thought patterns and social conditioning leads them to look for hidden meanings, like sarcasm. This may not sound like a big deal, but it colors everything from work communications to interpersonal conversations.<br /><br />There's also the intelligence = normal or \\"could try harder\\" equation. When an adult Aspergian is well-spoken and generally well-behaved it is assumed by others that they are somehow using Aspergers as an \\"excuse\\" for being socially awkward or abrupt-sounding in speech and that if the Aspergian \\"really wanted to\\" they could fit in better and learn social cues. I struggled, horribly, for many years trying to do just that even without a diagnosis. I failed, but it wasn't for lack of trying.<br /><br />This book is one of the few comprehensive studies of Aspergers in its various forms that addresses more than the diagnosis. It gave me insights into my own autistic tendencies as well as those of my son. I can't say that it changed my experiences in any way, but it left me feeling better about them and armed with a \\"tool kit\\" I could give to others who wanted to learn more.
B006DICWUE|4.0|I'm relatively new to the Nada Surf fan club although the band has been around for a long time.  I enjoyed everything I'd heard by them in the past, so buying this CD was a given.  I must admit that the first time I played it, I wasn't all that impressed.  But over the next few days, I found myself humming choruses of many of the tracks.  So I went back and gave it another listen, and now, each time I play this CD, I pick up on something I hadn't noticed before - which I consider to be the sign of a really great album that will stand the test of time.  At first I thought it was just okay, but now, my assessment of it has increased greatly.  This one will grow on you.  The only criticism that still stands is the sequencing of the tracks, and especially how it ends.  The album just....ends.  The last track doesn't really wrap up everything, it doesn't sound like a real ending.  It seems like there should be another song after it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game was very impressive.  The premise and game play was thought provoking, entertaining and quite addicting. I was glued to my Kindle anxious to find the next successful combinations until it was complete.  I extend my appreciation to the developers of this game.<br />Although the game &quot;hung&quot; my Kindle twice I still strongly give it 5 stars and look forward to playing similar games.
B0055EDBIE|3.0|I'd really like to give this 2.5 stars, but will settle on 3 since that is defined as \\"It's OK\\".  That's exactly how I feel about B&W America.  It's OK.  About half the album is good Lenny Kravitz and the other half sounds like he's coasting.  And this is coming from a guy that usually enjoys Kravitz and will defend him to those that dismiss him as a copycat or unoriginal.  I'll probably still buy the next Kravitz album - this one didn't disappoint me enough to turn me off of Lenny forever, but he'd better really kick the jams next time.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I loved the book and was doubtful that any 2 or even 3 hour movie would be able to cover so much of the plot. I was surprised by how good this movie is. I knew the plot well and found few changes or omissions that, in my opinion, mattered. The rooms, lighting and  views were as I imagined them while reading the book. This is a wonderful movie.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I was knocked out the first time I heard this album.  Just completely blown away.  Yeah, it's derivative of 90's rock, yeah, it sounds a lot like all the other Foo Fighters albums, but something - just something - is here that makes this rise above all the other FF albums.  There's a certain energy, or magic here - that's the power of music.  When the band really clicks - like the Foo does this time around, it's wonderful.  The only track I don't care for is White Limo because I don't like the screaming.  But other than that track, this is one really great rock record.
B002X7FELS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It gives a great insight to a mind not like my own. The main character's job is strange and so is his rock collecting. Folks with different strokes.
B005D0TETK|5.0|Really Paul Rodgers has a privileged voice and it keeps as good as since times of Free and Bad Company, and includes songs from all his career and some blues songs.
B005ZUR724|3.0|I love paying this game. This is as good as it's going to get for people on the kindle fire when it comes to MMORPGs. You don't have to pay 40 bucks a month to support servers, guilds are semi-permanent, you can team up with people to finish a quest, and then go your seperate ways, and you can have up to three different characters. My only complaint is that some of the quests are buggy, and I occasionally I get kicked off my server without warning. Also, the screen freezes after I play for too long, but after I reboot my kindle fire, everything is back to normal again.
0307949508|4.0|More like 4.5 I enjoyed this book more than the 1st in the series. It reminds me of a mystery by other authors I used to enjoy, but started to find too predictable, cheesy, trite, and cliche. This series is gripping and moving but also very smart. Some predictions can be made, but overall things flow with a relative amount of twists, turns, and realizations that are logical and believable. The ending on this one was excellent, I couldn't stop reading. Can't wait for the third, but am sad it will be the last. I know I will be upset when I get to the end.

Since I am just recently getting back into reading, this was one that's been on my list a long time.<br /><br />I would say this is more like a 4.5. It took me a long time to get into it. I wasn't sure I was going to get through it until page 75 or so. But by page 150 I was completely sucked in. Those first pages were very smart, filled with economics, politics, and ideas I needed to really focus on in order to process. For the most part, my reading comes in small bits, 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there. I think I would have gotten into this much faster and would have liked it more had I been able to read for a straight hour at the start.<br /><br />At the end, I was upset it was over, which is always a good sign. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was like mysteries I used to enjoy, Patterson or Gerritsen, but much deeper and smarter. Which is good, but hard with my schedule. I prefer books like this, but find it easier to read the quicker, easier ones because it requires less focus.
0451169514|5.0|This is one of the most incredible Stephen King books written. The first time I picked up this book I could not put it down, his writing is haunting, creative and smart and his books just get better and better each read. King is a page turner one where your eyes stay glued to the page from beginning to the end.  I can go on forever reading king and his imaginative style. But as much as I like King I also would like to highly recommend another author I have just read, great read, great book...check it out!!!! [[ASIN:B006KN0AKG Dysfunctional (The Root of Betrayal)]]
1451629184|4.0|I honestly don't know how to review this one. I was astounded, sad, overwhelmed, and depressed while reading. This poor girl went through so many horrible things. The book is written like a diary, not a novel or even biography. Which makes you realize just how real her story is. This book is very heavy, and somewhat depressed me. I am reading something incredibly light and fluffy after this one.

159514188X|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why should be mandatory reading for high school students in the United States. It speaks to every teenager, no matter what their personality or circles they hang out in. Every student can sympathize and relate to the issues in this book. I truly think this book can help teens everywhere deal with issues they feel or see.  Even though it may be a bit of an extreme circumstance it can still help remind kids of the importance of not breaking others' self confidence.<br /><br />**Not a spoiler of plot, but of writing form**<br /><br />My only criticism, and it isn't really a criticism, is the way it is written. I found it to be a slow read because it was written in the voice of two characters. One in italics, and one in regular print. At times, I would be reading and not realize it had switched voices, and since I am such a thorough reader I would back up and reread in the right character's voice. THAT BEING SAID, I do think the way it is done is very powerful. I can't imagine it being done any other way. It really is what makes the book what it is, but just made it a slower read for me.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I've loved this movie since childhood and was excited to purchase it for Christmas this year for my girls.  The digital quality seems very good, and all the old classic songs are there in crisp sound.  Now my girls are in love with \\"Miss Mary Poppins\\" as much as I am!  Couldn't be more pleased.
0316098329|5.0|Room was one of my favorite book of the year. It was moving, thought provoking, and such a page turner. This book was recommended to me because of my intensely close relationship to my 5 year old on the Autism spectrum. I thought of my son the entire time I read and during the book, and especially at the end, I was completely overcome with emotion. How much do I kids want our undivided attention? It really forced me to look at my kids and what is important. Maybe giving them the world may not always be what we think it is. Giving them our love and time is just as important, if not more.<br /><br />Besides how the book made me feel, think about life, and my relationship with my son, it was original and inventive. I've never read a book quite so creative. It was well written, with amazing character development, even though there are really only 2 characters.<br /><br />+++Spoiler+++<br />I was so overcome with emotion because to Jack, living in captivity in Room was the better world. It broke my heart that he had his mom all to himself in a small space, and then was just torn up when let out into the real world. He preferred living on top of him mom in Room so much to being out and experiencing what we assume all kids should and want to experience.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|So interesting. Every chapter is thought provoking and makes me think about how I operate. I can't wait until I finish reading it so that I can go back and read it again but more slowly so that I can really get into the detail.
0385534639|5.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices plastered on lampposts and billboards. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.\\"<br /><br />Everywhere I turned lately I was hearing about The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern. Although I had many other reads on my list, I put them aside. I like to have little knowledge of what I read ahead of time. When visiting Great Thoughts or other sites, I only peek at how well book is liked and basics, I never read the synopsis. With this book even more than others, everything should come to you as unknown. Even telling the names of the two main characters gives away an element of surprise with this book.<br /><br />I will simply say, The traveling Night Circus is magical. The story is set in the late 1800's and early 1900's and follows the lives of two illusionists bound in the playing of an intense imaginative challenge. Everyone involved with the circus is effected by growing magical feats and heightened intensity as an inevitable crumbling of the entire circus builds.<br /><br />The Night Circus is truly Imaginative, but not overly fantastical. Erin Morgenstern creates a whole new reality filled with desscription that transports you into the Night Circus (one of my favorite elements of a book is finding myself completely lost in the narrative). Yet, unlike with some excessively descriptive books, there is still an amazing story line and enough action to keep the book moving along quickly. Well written is an understatement when describing The Night Circus, as it is smart, thought provoking, and dense. I found myself rereading lines and paragraphs to make sure I got every bit of detail and meaning. It has the feel and intensity of a period piece mixed with the entertainment of an everyday page turner.<br /><br />The underlying love story is not cheesy or exceptionally romantic, but it is a main focus of the book that slowly creeps up throughout the twisted timeline of the book.<br /><br />This was easily one of my favorite books of 2011. I couldn't stop turning the pages, but didn't want it to end. I actually dreaded reading the last 10 pages and even forced myself to stop late at night when I would have finished, so I could make it last one more day and continue enjoying it./>This was easily one of my favorite books of 2011.

B00005JMX6|5.0|The Girl Next Door is a pretty good comedy.  It's about a young man who is lucky enough to experience a wish that many young men have- a REALLY attractive girl moves in next door.  Of course at the time he doesn't realize that he's interested in a porn star.  When he finds out who the girl is and what kind of work she does... well surprisingly, he doesn't exactly have his feelings hurt (at least, not as bad as one would expect) but after witnessing a pornographic film starring the girl, he *does* get pretty angry for a few moments.  Fortuntely his feelings for the girl are much greater than his sexual desires, so the two hit off a friendly relationship despite her line of work.<br /><br />Of course as a man, I remember wishing for an attractive knockout of a girlfriend like the one featured in this film when I went to high school.  We ALL have!  As a viewer, you get to watch how shy and bashful the boy understandably is around the girl.  Don't even try to convince me you'd act any differently than the boy portraying the shy character in this movie.  Come on!  You'd be shy too!  I admit that I'd be.<br /><br />As far as comedy is concerned, well the parts I enjoyed the most were whenever the boy thought he was in deep, deep trouble!  Let me give you an example by mentioning a scene in the beginning.  Before even knowing the girls name, he happens to catch a glimpse of the young woman through his bedroom window undressing.  She quickly turns around and sees the kid watching her.  The boy of course freaks out!  Suddenly the girl storms out of her house and runs over to ring the door bell.  The kid walks down the stairs, sees his parents standing there and starring him down.  He gulps, braces himself for punishment, however... that's not what happens at all!  Instead it's the next door neighbor coming over to introduce herself, haha.  That's just one example of the humor you can expect.  A segment involving the boy embarrassing himself by walking down the street in hisunderwear is another hilarious part.<br /><br />Overall, the characters are really spectacular.  The high school jerks are convincing and can't believe the nerdy kid actually has a porn star for a girlfriend, and even the boys dorky friends are stunned beyond belief as well.  It's amazing how the porn star actually stands by the boys side through all the silly adventures and aspirations.  The boy never really has to try very hard to prove his love either- other than one brief segment, the porn star falls back into his loving arms once again.  Perhaps because she realizes that not many boys accept a girls feelings as openly and lovingly as this one does, so she holds onto a special relationship.<br /><br />I have to end this review on a personal note by saying that the girl who plays the porn star (Elisha Cuthbert) is REALLY gorgeous in this role.  She was attractive in the hit TV show 24 as well, but here?  She's really beautiful in The Girl Next Door.<br /><br />Quality laughs, solid storyline, and all the right actors and actresses make this film a clear winner.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|when you watch the movie of this, you will find minor diffrences between the book and movie. But the book is still amazingly brilliant. One thing I did find annoying was the 100+ page leadup between the reaping etc and the actual hunger games because I was eager to see how Katn-oops, spoilers! enjoy the book!

B004T32SOK|1.0|I use box.com as an overflow for when my dropbox account is full. Unfortunately, I found out I am unable to download multiple files unless I upgrade to a paid account. The upgrade is advertised as $15 per user per month. But the minimum allowed upgrade is 3 users! So now I have to pay $45 just to download the files I have uploaded to box.com a few weeks ago! Terrible business model. If im going to pay, I'd rather give my money to the honest people at dropbox... not the shady people at box.com.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This animation follows a couple of young kids taken to the farming country by their father to be close to their mother, who is apparently living in a Tuberculosis sanitarium.  The star of the film is the incredibly exact rendition of lush, tropical verdure and Japanese countryside.  Almost like living for 90 minutes in a great landscape painting by somebody from the Hudson River School.  Lots of experiences for a kid: exploration, grace under pressure, and an overwhelming sense that the rural landscape is a large and wise creature, full of lessons, mysterious and worthy...
B000WO251Q|5.0|Since buying my Kindle Fire last weekend I had borrowed Dear John from my local online library(for Kindle), whew that's a mouth full! Well, I wasn't expecting to really enjoy the book, it was more of one of those books you just read because you're not sure what else to do! So I started the first chapter with no room for error from Nicholas Sparks, but I was soon pulled into a GREAT novel. To be totally honest I haven't been able to put the book down, I feel like Nicholas Sparks really pulls you into the book and give an abundant of details. Overall, I think that EVERY woman in this world should read this book, I'm so glad I read this book and I haven't regretted any moment of it!<br /><br />*NOTE* This is the first book I've read by Sparks, and I LOVED it, it's definitely worth the read!
B0061S073A|5.0|After my 4-year-old granddaughter bought \\"gems\\" in an app on my Kindle Fire, costing me $20, I contacted Amazon support to find out how to stop in-app purchases. Amazon replied that there currently isn't a way to stop in-app purchases. They recommended an app, but it wasn't what I wanted. Searching for alternatives, I came across this app.  It is perfect! You choose the apps you want the kids to use. When you start the app, it replaces the Fire's home screen with a screen of icons showing only the apps you selected for use by the kids. You can choose to have the app start automatically each time the Kindle is turned on. Once the app is started, you have to enter an unlock code in order to get back to the Fire's home screen. I start the app when the grandkids get here and exit the app when they leave. It blocks their apps from purchasing anything from the marketplace. I didn't put a browser or Facebook app on the kids' apps screen, so they have no access to the Internet. This app is exactly what I needed, and I am very happy with it. I highly recommend this app for all Kindle Fire owners who have little ones who use your device.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|a epic game with fantastic boss Battles and you get to play with gravity and a new ice bird that freezes things
B0058VW36U|4.0|I think its ok not bad but there should be a free version<br />hard to get all 3 stars on some levels but the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because this game needs a free version
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was the second book of the trilogy \\"The Hunger Games\\" and it was not as good as the first.  Definitely not.  But it was still very well written and made me want to finish the series.  I do enjoy a good book.  I also know a good book when I read it and this, was very good.
B003ZYU3T6|4.0|Charlie Chaplin was the master of physical situation comedy back then, because talkies (films with dialogue and speech) hasn't quite taken off yet, so activity was the theme of the comedy. Charlie Chaplin's repetitious twitch from tightening two screws over and over from the production line in the factory was just priceless.<br /><br />But, what really made this film important for me to own was having the beautiful Paulette Goddard as the Gamin (what does that mean anyway?).  Even without words, her presence on film came off strong and dominating.  Without her, this film would definitely show signs of something more missing because she added platonic romance and excitement to the film as Charlie Chaplin provided the comedy.<br /><br />And this film definitely reflects a future beyond the initial year this film was made.  Perhaps not to us, (the current film viewer), but to the audiences of 1936, this film may appear to have been about 50 years ahead of it's time.  I wonder if anyone else caught that.<br /><br />Anyway, I saw this film on cable TV about 30 years ago, and so I do remember that I thought that it was way ahead of it's time for being filmed in 1936.  I never bothered to consider that the film may be worthy to own on VHS back then, but when I saw that the Criterion Collection has allowed this film to grace its large unique collection on Blu-ray, I knew that I would want to have it now.<br /><br />Yes, with Paulette Goddard with her greasy hair, and dirty black dress, and her beautiful eyes and her lovely smile, I cherish this movie all the more.  This is definitely a keeper on Blu-Ray.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I was hesitate that I was going to get a similar gaming aspect of the other Angry Birds but with a starry background. I was definitely wrong! it is nothing like the other versions, from the gaming system, to the music, it all is a wonderful change. you just have to try it to experience the new, challenging goals of this game. do not hesitate at all to purchase this app! It looks fantastic on my kindle fire..it will definitely please those Angry Birds fanatics!
0439023513|2.0|I eagerly bought the last book in this series, having been completely enthralled by the first two. And I wanted to love it. I wanted to go on that emotional roller coaster again, riding right there along with characters that I came to love. But unfortunately that wasn't the case, and it didn't take me long to figure out why.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that the first two books weren't about a girl and her love life against the backdrop of war, it was actually all about the war and being a part of it. Except, it wasn't. The first two books have a very specific tone and feel to them, and while the upcoming war is a big part of it, the books are all about this girl, and what she goes through as her world undertakes this massive change that she's a big part of.  And the third book veers sharply away from that.<br /><br />To me, this book wasn't about her, or even the characters as a whole, it was an account of war strategy, interspersed with horrific events that leave our main character constantly drugged and/or hospitalized, in pain, emotionally damaged, and even a bit off her rocker at times. And yet you find yourself failing to care. This girl, whose character I couldn't get enough of previously, left me feeling completely indifferent, as I was when terrible things happened to previously beloved characters. That is what truly makes this book a failure to me. Not that it doesn't have the happy ending everyone wanted, or that is was dismal and depressing because of the war, but because I couldn't bring myself to care one whit about what happened to any of these people. There was absolutely none of the charm or emotion of the first two books. The 'girl on fire' had completely lost her spark, and with it, my interest.<br /><br />*SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER* To illustrate this best I'll explain it the way I explained it to my husband. In The Hunger Games, when Katniss volunteered to take Prim's place, I was choked up, literally. I could feel myself in the situation, and I ached for the characters. In Mockingjay, Prim is blown to bits while Katniss watches, and I couldn't care less.
B0058VW36U|5.0|not only is this great so a ages and extremely challenging, it just brings great joy to your day. the bright colors enhance the gaming aspect even more by transporting you into the boxes with the little creature. the game definitely leaves you waiting for more as it gets progressively more complex. a wonderful time consumer and definitely challenges the mind! the .99 is definitely worth it!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was nicely surprised, the book was very explicit, but I liked it. In order for you to know what happened to Christian you have to buy the sequels (which I did) and I have to say that they were worth it!

B004UXUUDA|5.0|Other reviewers have covered the plot of Sarah's Key admirably, and commented on the differences between the book and the movie. I simply want to concur with the sentiments of several reviewers who have said that this is an outstanding film on a subject of great importance. The marketing dollars and special effects budgets spent on Hollywood fare are largely wasted; the productions are ephemeral and insignificant, pablum for the brain at best and a waste of precious minutes at worst. Sarah's Key, in contrast, is worth every moment of attention. The acting, script, camerawork and direction are all top-form. The subject matter is painful, disturbing, uncomfortable - and essential.<br /><br />Humanity is, at times, bestial. At times of disruption (war, revolution) the weak, the cunning, the ruthless and the amoral all rise to power and for some time lord it over ordinary people whose very tendency to keep their heads down, hope for the best, and not stand up against injustice means that inevitably they will be sheep to the slaughter-house. In Sarah's Key we see vividly how ordinary French people enthusiastically collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to rid France of its Jewish citizens. The French, naturally, prefer to forget this moment in their history - but forgetting merely makes it all the easier for such horrors to recur at a later date. And we must understand, each one of us, that every country, every race, every people at every time is susceptible to such horrors. All it takes is a little social disruption and a powerful voice saying \\"do this\\" and we, the consumate herd animal, will obey. We will wreak harm on our neighbors. The insecure, the repressed, the bitter, the uneducated, the dregs - they will rise and assume power and everyone else will fall meekly into line. Unless we remember, and very early in the process stand against such things. Movies like Sarah's Key remind generations who were born after World War II that life is more complex and more dark than Disney would have us believe, and we need to pay attention to what's going on around us if we're not to wake up and realize we ourselves participated in a horror.<br /><br />If you need a history lesson, Sarah's Key is a great way to begin.n Disney would have us believe, and we need to pay attention to what's going on around us if we're not to wake up and realize we ourselves participated in a horror.<br /><br />If you need a history lesson, Sarah's Key is a great way to begin.
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|female standin for kurt russell as lead is a waste of film...and this rendition is a rerun, not a prequel, until the last half hour or so...good fx, but like most sequels (which, for the most part, this is), has been overanalyzed, underwritten, and lacks spontaneity...ciao.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I read a lot, and this may be one of the best biographies I've ever read.  It was extremely easy and enjoyable to read.  While the author clearly admires Jobs, he doesn't so much force his opinions on your as let you decide for yourself.  He also doesn't pull any punches about Jobs' shortcomings.  Jobs story is incredible, and this book did a great job telling it.  You don't have to be a Jobs fan, Apple fan, or techie to really enjoy this book.  Because it was an &#34;authorized biography&#34; that Jobs cooperated with, you hear many things directly from Jobs himself.  What's important, and what the author makes clear from the beginning, is that while Jobs cooperated with the book, he exercised no control over it whatsoever.  I imagine that is more of Jobs genius, knowing that his story would be better told and more credible without his control over it.  Overall, I found Jobs story truly inspiring.  Like him or not, he was clearly a genius of modern industry.  The author did a marvelous job of telling the story.  Highly recommended!  Finally, I purchased the Kindle version.  It was high-quality with no problems that I noticed.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Great on the kindle fire. Very addicting, and I find it easier than the regular Angry Birds because of the whole orbit thing

B006W0QOF2|5.0|a real long time.  Sure, it is violent but it's done well.  My only complaint was the cheesy song during the final scene, something about being a hero.  Other than that, fine filmmaking in full effect.
0439023513|3.0|I never expected or wanted a cookie cutter happy ending and was ultimately happy with the ending and found it very appropriate.<br />Overall the book wasn't bad, but compared to the previous books it fell far short. It felt rushed. Character development fell off and I got annoyed with being smacked over the head with the new theme of the book that \\"war is hell.\\"<br />Katniss spends most of the book in hopeless PTSD type state. Which is understandable considering what she went through, but it takes away from her melt down after Prim's death.<br />The aspect of the book that bothered me the most is how Peeta was treated. It felt as though everyone gave up on him except district 13 medical team. I would have liked to have seen more effort from Katniss, not even from an undying love angle but from the same grit in the second book of \\"Im going to protect you\\" and save you from whatever physical or emotional threat.<br />The end, which should have been the most developed and exciting felt rushed. I dont feel nearly the emotion I should with Finnick and Prim's death. There is also far to little time spent addressing what Katniss did to Coin.<br />And finally, I wanted more time spend on Katniss and Peeta's coming back together.  I would have liked to see them get to know each other again, considering how much they have both changed. It wouldn't make sense for them to just fall into each others arms and I wasn't looking for overly sappy, but a few more pages and exchanges would have made a huge difference. It also would have been nice to see how the other districts were coming back together and how the new Panem was functioning.<br />The first two books were fabulous and riveting, its just so sad when the final book in a trilogy does not live up to the preceding books. And especially when just a little more development and a little less \\"smacking over head with a theme\\" could have delivered something spectacular.

B004EPYZU8|3.0|The Trailers for the film can be a bit misleading unless you read the synopsis. Visually striking yes and the soundtrack is awesome but the film is sometimes repetitive and is ultimately lacking something (at least i felt that way, dunno bout you guys). Still a good movie though, Just don't expect much.

B00127RAJY|4.0|These workouts are fantastic when you've only got 20 minutes or on those days when you really have to talk yourself into working out because you'd rather go back to bed! They are short, but still challenging and sweat-worthy. The cool-downs are a little too short for me -- I usually stretch just a little bit longer, but that's not a complaint about the workout. Definitely glad to have these on hand for an alternative to a 30 or 45 minute session.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|When we purchased this movie we were amazed at how endearing this little vignette was, at surface it looked to be a sci-fi beat em up with robots, a great way to spend an evening, but the warming little story of father and child left us with tears and joy, not that it was a happy ending.<br />Hugh Jackman is an actor with hidden depths and played his part par excellence'. An excellent, and surprisingly good, movie I have no problem recommending to friends!

0061478784|5.0|I haven't read the book yet, but I'm curious on the different take of it. I loved the movie and would enjoy reading the book. I'm curious on the book's version of the characters and storyline.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I admit to being caught in the hype surrounding this book. A friend lend me her paperback copy and I started this right when I was in the middle of another thought provoking book just because I saw the movie commercial.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins crafted a book you will not want to put down. The main characters are all young and once you get to know them and what they are about to do, you are hooked.<br /><br />The hunger games is an annual event, a reality show where the 12 districts of a new nation \\"Panem\\" sends one boy and one girl ages 12 to 18 to the Capitol to literally kill until only 1 of them will survive. They will have to fend for themselves and survive harsh conditions while being hunted.  Katniss volunteered to go when her sister's name was picked.<br /><br />I would recommend this book. It made me teary, made me laugh and I got so engrossed with the characters and captivated with the game. The end opens the door for Catching Fire, the second book in the trilogy.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|I loved this movie.  Great action, the fight scenes were epic.  I got a little lost during the movie the first time I watched, but have watched it several times since.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|still does updates.  more like an electronic keyboard with diff beat selections and tap along tunes as well.  doesn't look as cheezy and plain as some of the others
B00785P2QC|3.0|its a pretty desent game to play on the kindle. I would recumend it. it just suks that. it takes so long to save money to build things.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|This is a very suspenseful movie, and Very well done. I really liked how the movie was very similar to the book. I think they found a great way to take out enough of the book so that the movie wasn't hours long, and that they didn't take out some of the more important parts. I think having Susan Collins help with the movie gave us a better feel of how she wanted the characters to be portrayed in the book. this movie was one of the better movies I have seen, but you definitely should read the books before seeing the movie.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I love this show so much...There's something about this..drama, suspense...Like your at the edge of the seat..Its like an addiction..you crave for more. I know its unhealthy...but I LOVE IT...

B004MC8CA2|5.0|After a long stressful day I like to sit down for my quiet time with my Bible. If only to read a few verses.  It is so uplifting.
1416550534|3.0|I had a difficult time deciding on a 'rating' for this book. Finally split the difference and gave it a 3 stars. The truth of the matter is I had to almost fight my way through the first 70-75% of the book and based on that would have given it no more than 1 star....I nearly hated the darn thing. It was merely sheer cussed stubborness that kept me reading at all. SLOW does not begin to describe the long, empty passages that describe in nitpicky detail the most mundane items that in no way advance a darn thing. I was baffled quite honestly, having simply adored The Forgotten Garden I had such anticipation for this book and found myself checking to make certain it actually 'was' the same author. And then.....then it all changed in barely the space of a paragraph and the last 25% I could not read fast enough! Everything finally came together, it all began to make sense and my anticipation grew with every turn of the page. I found the pay off a surprise as to the 'who' and exactly 'what' (being very careful here as to not give anything away) and finished the book well satisfied. I'd give this last portion 4 1/2 stars easily! She really, really makes you struggle and suffer for it but at the end I was glad I persevered.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book has some very sad moments. For those of you who are reading this book but abandon it because it's too sad, don't . There are parts that will make you want to cry because the boy was so sad, but it's all okay in the end. It's very inspirational though, because it really makes a person think about how their actions affect the lives of another. Read it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|very fun and addictive game play.  easy to understand fast and nice smooth play highly recommend to all who enjoy solitaire
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I had the free version on my phone for the longest and loved it. When I saw all the problems people were having with this, I almost didn't get it. I am happy that I decided to get it anyway. I had no problems with force closes on my kindle fire.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|The movie so great and Cloney just incredible and maybe his best performance, about BD great picture and audio 4.5 stars great picture detail and audio so good.<br /><br />The majority of the things in your life are out of your control, but what you can control is your reaction. That's the idea that 'The Descendants' explores.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I had purchased a couple of these types of things from a different site (and it was a different product)....and they were pretty cheaply made and fairly flimsy and then I had to get a kickstand like thing to support them....and still one of them broke.  I needed this because at home and on the road I have access to some docks that don't allow my case (Ivyskin and my wife's is an Otterbox) to fit without removing the case....which is a pain.  Also at work and on the road, I find docks that will work without the case but possibly don't charge the idevices...<br /><br />So I searched here on Amazon and found this product (CableJive dockStubz) and it works perfectly.  It is much sturdier and works AWESOME....I have a dock at work that I got a long time ago that was for gen 3 and 4 ipods and doesn't really work with iPhone 4....with this dock it does and it charges just fine.<br /><br />You still might need a kickstand piece if the dock forces the CableJive dockStubz to stand to straight....it might need a little support...but that's fine.<br /><br />This was about 3x to 4x the price of the orignal products I found, but it was worth it.<br /><br />Very happy with this product.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|I could care less about baseball and I loved this movie. Sure the subject matter is about the game. But the true story is about the human spirit to find a better way. Jonah Hill was awesome and deserved an Oscar. Brad Pitt was convincing and did not rely on his handsome charm or looks. Hoffman nailed his role as disbelieved concerned for his career.<br /><br />Even if you loathe baseball, give this movie a chance. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />And if you like this and have ever watched the TV series \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" you should also give that a try. Both are inspiring with real characters you want to see win, and not just on the field.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|First, I love these books, and this is a great adaption of it. The story is complex and dramatic, with fascinating villains and heroes. It's like Tom Clancy meets Lord of the Rings. HBO did a great job with the cast, visuals and script, equal to Rome (which is similar).<br /><br />That said, I must complain about the discs. Discs 1-3 worked fine, but disc 4 not only didn't work but prompted an update that disabled the ability of my Powerdvd to play ANY Blu-ray. Not sure what it did, but now I must run expensive software to disable protection to make it work.<br /><br />That is the irony of Blu-ray copy protection. It doesn't stop pirates, but it inconveniences paying customers. I consider what they did to me the equivalent of a virus. Someone needs to file a class action.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Loved it. would be better if I had WIFI  all the time. But when I did have it, it was awesome. I lovehow God keeps up with technology.  He leaves NO excuse for some one not to get into his word.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I did not even know about this series until just recently.  I rented it and watched it too fast!  Now it is finished and I am so sad!  I loved it!  The movie was so good also!  A great show with characters I loved to get to know! I am so disappointed with the powers that be that they didn't get the \\"vision\\"!  What a loss!  People in power shouldn't dabble in the works of such creative people as Joss Whedon!  Such possibilities!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The romance was believable, the dialogue was funny, and the characters weren't perfect. No one in real life is perfect, so the characters in the best book all have flaws. It's what makes them interesting and worthwhile. I also really liked that the attraction was both intellectual AND physical. Lust is not the same thing as love, and too many authors forget that. I found this book refreshing, I highly recommend it.
B007C9N4H8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think about watching this but I was so very surprised.  I found my childhood returning as they met and encountered Muppets for a new generation.  The music really had the old Muppet style and I just fell completely in love with this film.  I also adored some of the very well done pop cultural references, the special guest stars.  It really was an amazing movie and experience.
0062060562|5.0|After an accident she had several years ago, Christine lost all her memories and every day she has to build upon what is being told to her by her husband; but whatever she learns or remembers during the day will be lost once she goes into a deep sleep, so the following morning she will start again from scratch. This is how a doctor tells her to write her diary, so that reading it every day might eventually help. (Of course, every morning she doesn't even remember she has a diary, but the doctor makes sure to call her every day, introduce himself as for the first time, and tell her to look for her book so that she can read it and understand what is happening...) Little by little, she starts to find out that maybe not everything she is being told is true, and she doesn't know whom she can trust or not. Believe me, you won't be able to put the book down, because you will also want to know the truth!<br /><br />It is very easy to read, and it's a very well crafted thriller, since the author leaves no gaps of missing information, any wondering you might have gets answered sooner or later (although some reviewers don't think so, but the fact is they mustn't have read the book thoroughly, because I actually found the answers to all their wonderings in the story itself). It had to be written as a diary, because it is supposed to be all the entries that the amnesic woman writes on her journal to help her retrieve all her lost memories.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game they should come out with angry birds in space oh they did that with zero gravity it is perfect but not only hard
0785132619|5.0|I saw the movie first and had to get the graphic novel, the ideas are close but the novel is much different, i like it to, its intresting to see things play out in different ways. I like the character of kick ass in the GN more than the movie, but Big daddy in the movie more than in the GN. EASILY worth the buy
B0062A3F8G|5.0|This purchase was a gift. We were pleasantly surprised with the item. It was packaged differently than other DVD's I have ordered and purchased before. It was a neat gift, and made the recipient very happy. I liked the way the disks were stored in the globe. I would buy from this seller in the future.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|its so bad it doesn't load inless you buy any of the games but it may be a great game<br />if it were to load
B000F1IQNM|4.0|Loved this movie, and would reccommend it for family veiwing.  It has everything that makes it charming for children, with just enough \\"spice\\" and literary depth so that adults can enjoy it, too.<br /><br />It is kind of quirky and sometimes a little scary feeling, but not intensely so.  I have 7 and 5 year old granddaughters who enjoyed it without having trouble sleeping afterwards.  It has humor, spookiness, sadness, romance, symbolism, and fantasy all rolled into one.  The ending will positively give you goosebumps!<br /><br />Since there has been so many reviews that compare this movie to Mary Poppins, I cannot resist the temptation to add my 2 cents worth.  Even as a child, I didn't care for Mary Poppins.  I know that a lot of people love it and it is a classic, but in my opinion is is just TOO syrupy sweet.  Nanny McPhee just doesn't come off as one dimensionally sugary, and is genuinely interesting to me.  There are some similarities in the message, but in Mary Poppins, the children are simply perfect and misunderstood while the parents are neglectful and need to be taught a lesson.  In Nanny McPhee, everyone has lessons to learn, and the children are depicted with as much to be corrected as the parent.  The result is a story that is so much more interesting and has a more truthful ring than Mary Poppins.<br /><br />I especially liked how Nanny McPhee's physical appearance functions much like a mirror to the people she is helping.  When she arrives, she is hideous - because THEY are hideous, but as the hearts of the family expand and grow, her appearance alters to reflect that.  By the end of the movie, Nanny McPhee is as beautiful as the family has become.  Love It!  It reminded me of the Bible verse that says, \\"All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.\\"  (Hebrews 12:11)  Very insightful message in my opinion.  I also thought it was interesting that not EVERYONE in this story is helped to be a \\"better person\\" - some of the characters are genuinely blind, greedy and evil.  The characters remain so until the bitter end and nothing can help them.  Nanny McPhee is sent only to people who have hearts that are able to change.  There has been some discussion among religious people over whether \\"Nanny\\" is a devil, but I think she is an angel.  Even God Himself can look ominous to people who are in a degraded state, and I have no problem with how she appears at first.  It is simply an indication of the state of the people who view her, and actually quite aptly drawn.<br /><br />I always thought that Emma Thompson is one of the most talented performers I know, but now I regard her as a bona fide genius, who can write as well as act.  I am not a star struck woman, but this is one person I wouldn't mind meeting some day.interesting that not EVERYONE in this story is helped to be a \\"better person\\" - some of the characters are genuinely blind, greedy and evil.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is the full version except it has ads. It is one of the best free apps on the app store. For IOS, the free version is like a demo. This is a better buy. You save 99 cents on the exact same thing as the paid version. I recommend it to everyone. A must-have.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I discovered this series just as HBO was making the unfortunate decision to cancel it. What a pity. Bruno Heller has done a fine job of recreating and interpreting the last days of the Roman Republic. While the series is based on history and generally adheres to historical fact, it is far from a dry documentary or a badly costumed B-movie with everyone wrapped in bed sheets. The characters, real and fictional, are wonderfully played by a mostly British cast. The costuming is authentic and the cinematography is movie quality. Polly Walker is unforgettable as Atia, who plays politics and men with equal enthusiasm. The show's main characters, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson) are based on the only two ordinary Roman soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his commentaries on the Gallic wars. The discipline, organization and military engineering that enabled Rome's conquests are clearly depicted. Hollywood usually depicts combat in the ancient world as a kind of brawl with swords and sandals. Rome doesn't make that mistake. The characters, the costumes and the motivations ring true.<br /><br />Be sure to watch the features and listen to the commentaries, which provide a lot of interesting detail on the choices regarding the synthesis of history and drama.<br /><br />One more thing: This is a show for grownups and mature older teenagers. It includes graphic violence and sexual situations, which are part of the plot, not simply titillation or a crude attempt to build interest. If you can't tolerate the sight of a breast, buttocks, a penis or the bloody murder of Julius Caesar, don't bother with this series.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Five stars. I recommend this game to anyone. Like the original, but better. Less levels, but cooler levels. I'm sure zeptolab will make more levels later though.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I loved this book. You really get the sense of Richard Feynman's character from this memoir. He was incredibly smart but also insatiably curious. He was interested in everything and was the archetypal \\"life-hacker\\". Some other reviewers consider this book to be an example of Feynman's arrogance and self-importance. I couldn't disagree more. He comes across as playfully curious about everything and (of course) good at many things but he is as surprised as anyone at how good he can be at something with a little effort. Going to another country? Learn the language. Want to open a safe? Learn how they work. Like pictures? Learn how to draw. We need more Feynmans in the world.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So much fun games.  You choose one then choose a different game that is fun.  I have to type this to post it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really can not believe this is a free program.  I have paid for apps that do much less than the YouVersion Holy Bible.  Thanks to the developer.  You have some stars going to your crown one day.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|I have not read the novels or seen the Swedish trilogy of movies.<br /><br />Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a pretty good movie. I found it to be unique in its own way and never found myself bored at any point. Its one of the better movies I've seen in a while, but its not perfect either.<br /><br />The movie has some interesting sex scenes so those that are easily offended should not bother watching the movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the opening cinematic with music from Trent Reznor. It had a slightly James Bond feel to it.<br /><br />Rooney Mara did a great job playing the character Lisbeth. It was interesting to see her ability to look like a mostly unattractive goth chick in one part of the movie to being absolutely gorgeous in another part. I finished the movie wondering how crazy she really was and how much of it was just an act. She really had the standout role in this movie and easily overshadowed anything Daniel Craig did.<br /><br />The overall storyline of the rich family was a little weak, but served its purpose. It did feel like the director was trying to jam as much as possible onto the screen at times as we flew back and forth between different parts of the plot though this wasn't done so much that it ruined the movie. There were no real surprises when it came to who the killer was in the end, but it was fun to watch the story lead up to the discovery.<br /><br />The ending was a little sad. We may be left unsure how crazy Lisbeth really is, but you can see she is a sad, lonely girl. She finally finds a decent guy to open up to, and then it all falls apart for her right at the end. You are really left hoping she gets her fairy tale ending at some point in the future as the rest of the story plays out in future movies.<br /><br />Overall this movie is definitely worth at least renting. It is enjoyable and the actors do a good job with a mostly solid story. I really hope they make the last two movies and watching this has made me want to read the novels.

B000068FXR|5.0|Man I'm glad I ignored the professional mixer who trashed this remaster of a truly great album. I nearly didn't purchase because of incorrect information. if you like Supertramp go ahead and buy this remastered version it just sounds purely great with the right amount of 'cojones' to improve upon the thinness of the original recording. Unless you could purchase the original studio tapes and do your own mix this is as good as it can get for a fresh take of old material. I'm really glad that someone has taken the time and the use of new technology to produce remasters of all time favourite recordings. I am not saying the originals were hard to listen to as you had no choice, they were done using current technology at the time. But if someone can improve on your listening enjoyment by improving on the original material without taking anything away from the original recording it has to be a win win situation. You will surely enjoy this album with it's new boost of sound. If you are going to review material please review the actual material on offer and not stray from the path and give a wrong impression as I often use reviews to decide on purchases. I don't want to hear how good the older versions were I want to hear about how this actual new version. Good night and God bless.

0767821629|2.0|I finally watched this movie, hoping for a more CGI version of Fassbinder's remarkably great movie &#34;World on a Wire&#34; (1973), or even something that was respectful to the original story. It was neither; I was astounded at how bad this movie was.<br /><br />Notes before reading: 1) I read the Galouye story, &#34;Simulacron-3,&#34; BEFORE watching either Fassbinder's adaptation or this one; 2) I am a fan of Armin Mueller-Stahl; 3) I enjoy sci-fi immensely. I really, really attempted to like this movie, mostly because of the numerical ratings it has received here and on imdb (and I don't read the written reviews beforehand).<br /><br />The beginning really made me believe I was going to be awed: the great 1930s landscape, a film noir look, interesting-looking set designs, and (to top it all off) the GREAT Armin Mueller-Stahl! But what brought me awe quickly turned into balderdash. The story merely relied on 1/3rds of the original story, with the characters changing their original literary roles that gave the story so much depth. The questions of &#34;what is real&#34; in the original story was not the cynical plot of this adaptation. The special effects were the equivalent to those of a rock concert, with laser lights in fog, glowing eyes, and (straight from television's &#34;Stargate SG-1&#34; - but even less graphic) wormholes! I don't know what the budget was for this movie, but I guarantee that Fassbinder's wonderful adaptation was even less than the budget for this movie.<br /><br />The story follows Douglas Hall and his attempt to find the killer of Fuller, his partner. Dennis Haysbert plays, with little depth, a detective (who has an entirely different role in the story) attempting to find the murderer. Vincent d'Onofrio looks and acts like a slightly-overweight John Malkovich, playing the most interesting character, the Simulacron-3 technician, but, with how interesting the other characters were, this really isn't saying much. Basically, you have a huge cast of TV actors and actresses, and there is a reason that they do TV (even though some have &#34;touched&#34; cinema, off and on).<br /><br />I really don't know how far to go in the scenario, but I felt like I was watching a really bad, B-grade, made-for-cable-TV sci-fi that was relying more upon capitalizing on the success of &#34;The Matrix&#34; and others of its ilk than being true to Galouye's story. I tend to believe that the filmmakers were wanting to &#34;jump on the bandwagon&#34; at the time, regardless of the cost to the original story. Perhaps many of those reviews that give this movie such high marks were done by those anti-&#34;The Matrix&#34; fans. I really don't know. Maybe times have changed, and many of the reviewers may want to go back and replay this movie with some more objectivity.<br /><br />Even more aggravating is that the movie must be so bad in the producers' eyes that they can't even stand to release the DVD in WIDESCREEN!!! That really tells you something!<br /><br />I commented to my wife that more money was probably spent on the helicopter shots than the rest of the movie. I really wish Galouye's original story would be given the credit and respect it is due, along with the ability to do so with the CGI effects that are now the mainstay of cinema.<br /><br />I give 2 stars for Mueller-Stahl (always a great screen presence, even though his acting is wasted here) and for the quite breathtaking ending effects of the future in the end - the end being the closest to that of the novel, but too late for the rest of the movie to be good.cast of TV actors and actresses, and there is a reason that they do TV (even though some have &#34;touched&#34; cinema, off and on).<br /><br />I really don't know how far to go in the scenario, but I felt like I was watching a really bad, B-grade, made-for-cable-TV sci-fi that was relying more upon capitalizing on the success of &#34;The Matrix&#34; and others of its ilk than being true to Galouye's story.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The premise of this book immediately grabs your attention: every year, 24 children of Panem are forced to fight to the death in gladiatorial games that are purported to be held to pay tribute to the great sacrifices made to win back a nation's freedom. In reality, however, the games are held to keep the citizenry fearful of its masters, and to entertain the depraved, grotesque aristocracy.<br /><br />I liked several things about this book:<br /><br />- Its portrayal of how evil can masquerade as virtue. The masters of the games wear masks (literally) of sweetness, beauty, courage, and honor, yet they are, in their hearts, self-delusional, sociopathic, cynical cowards.<br /><br />- Its portrayal of how all evil needs to win is for good people to do nothing. Katniss, the protagonist, decides to stand up to the system and shows that tyranny can triumph only with the cooperation of the oppressed.<br /><br />This message can be found throughout literature (look at all of Ayn Rand's works) and history (Ghandi is the exemplar) because it's TRUE.<br /><br />- Its portrayal of how fragile a totalitarian state truly is. All it takes is a large enough portion of a population to feel that it has nothing left to lose, and a spark of hope for freedom.<br /><br />- It is written simply and moves quickly. You won't get bored.<br /><br />- Mrs. Collins has no problems causing the characters pain and suffering, which makes for good drama.<br /><br />- Everyone likes to root for the underdog, and ride the emotional roller coaster that accompanies this type of tale.<br /><br />I didn't like several things about this book:<br /><br />- The writing style is bit too simple for my tastes. I know this is YA, but the prose was very choppy and unimaginative. It got the job done and told the story, but I can't say much for it beyond that.<br /><br />- The premise, as described, was a bit flimsy. Seventy-four years of these barbaric festivities and Katniss was the FIRST to volunteer in her district in place of a loved one? The people still just calmly line up and ship their children off to die? The ending also makes you wonder that in all that time, she was the FIRST to do that?<br /><br />I don't have a problem suspending disbelief when reading or watching stories, and I'm not one to constantly try to poke holes in plots, so this is a minor complaint. But just something I'd like to point out.<br /><br />- The story doesn't even try to sell the counter-idea, which is the value of having the Games in the society. It succeeded in showing the inhumanity of it all, but great stories always present compelling arguments for the other \\"evil\\" and get you to--even if for a second--think, \\"Well, I guess that IS kind of true, but...\\" This doesn't happen in Hunger Games.<br /><br />- I didn't care about the characters very much. They were very one-dimensional and there was no significant arc for the main characters (that is, the story didn't change who they were or reveal anything new of importance). This was especially true with Katniss, who didn't reveal much behind her cool, impassive exterior.<br /><br />- The mawkish romance between Peeta and Katniss didn't add much to the story for me. In fact, it felt kind of irrelevant. But I think this is more of a genre convention than anything else, so it didn't really bother me.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />All in all, this was a fun book that has a valuable message, although it felt a bit under-developed. It's not in my top 10, 50, or even 100, but it's a structurally sound story that has the right amount of novelty and poignant emotional energy to make it worth reading.

Bernie had quit his long time position when the police force was moved into the Gestapo.  Bernie could have stayed, but when many of the Jewish policemen he had worked with for years were fired simply for being Jewish, Bernie knew he had to get out.  No longer employed, Bernie was eligible for the draft, and he ended up in Belorussia.  This was going from bad to worse.  His job there was as part of an elimination team.  This was to be the forerunner of the Final Solution developed at the Wannsee Conference in January, 1942.  Whole villages were marched out and each individual was either shot or hanged.  Since this process was too slow and labor intensive, taking as it did, soldiers from the fighting, a new solution had to be found.  Hence the Final Solution.  Heydrich had discovered how good Bernie is in solving crimes and ordered him back into the police force which Heydrich headed.<br />.  When Heydrich is appointed  the Reichsprotector of Bohemia and Moravia, Heydrich wants Gunther with him to head Heydrich's protection unit in Prague.  Known as The Butcher for his wholesale killing of partisans and others, Heydrich was definitely in danger.  Along with the protection duty, Heydrich wants Gunther to figure out which of his staff officers is working with the Czech underground to undermine the Nazi's redevelopment and relocation work in Czechoslovakia.<br />Gunther's work is made more difficult by the fact that many of the \\"faithful\\" Nazi officers are actually people who have lost their taste for National Socialism and are plotting to bring Hitler and his people down.  Also involved is a young woman named Arianne whom Gunther falls in love with and brings with him to Prague.<br />If Gunther had gone from bad to worse in going to Belorussia fromBerlin, he now ended up in even more of a hell by having to live in Heydrich's villa with a dozen or so of Heydrich's staff including several top Nazis.  Bernie solves his crime but returns to Berlin under a cloud.  As History shows, Heyrich was killed by partisans in early summer of 1942 and honored with a state funeral attended by all of the top Nazi leaders including Hitler.  As added recognition of the loss of Heyrich, General Karl Hermann Frank sent orders to one of his staff to destroy the village of Lidice, Czechoslovakia and to kill all of its citizens.<br />As always, Philip Kerr has written an exciting mystery story.  His research as usual is full and deep, and there is a lot to learn about these early years of World War II while reading an entertaining novel.  We seem to be experiencing a resurgence of interest in this period of the Twentieth Century, and this is an excellent way to learn about it.
B0059XTUEK|4.0|I chanced to watch this film on a flight from Singapore to San Francisco. It turned out to be such a delightful film that I ended up watching it again before we landed. Marilyn Monroe died well before I knew much about her in India and over the years I had never seen  any of her films. But I have often read about her as a rather innocent person with immense sexuality and vulnerability. But lack of knowledge of Marilyn is not an impediment to enjoy this film. Whatever I imagined Marilyn Monroe to be was brought to life by the brilliant portrayal of Michelle Williams. She is vivacious like Marilyn as well.<br /><br />The film is about the making of another film , 'The Prince and the Showgirl' in 1956 in England. The producer and director was the famous Laurence Olivier who also plays the role of the prince Regent of Carpathia. During the filming, Olivier flies into rage over Monroe's indecisive nature, her inability to fit into the organized structure of his work and her unpredictability. Monroeis intimidated and seeks refuge in the kindly, besotted, admiring 25-year old Colin Clark, who is the third assistant director in the staff. The movie is about the delightful simplicity of her life of one week with Colin. Then, her husband and playwright Arthur Miller returns from Boston and Marilyn leaves with him to the US, leaving Colin to cherish fondly that incredible one week.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier is magnificent. Again, I have never seen Olivier's films but have read about him at various times. But Branagh just brings him to reality for me just as I had imagined Olivier to be. Young Eddie Redmayne as Colin is excellent as the 25-year old and very credible. And as I have said already, Michelle Williams is fantastic. She brings Marilyn's beauty, sexuality, innocence and vulnerability to life. She is the star of the film.<br /><br />It is a must-see film simply for its ability to make you feel good about everything around you, at least temporarily!

0373774184|4.0|I loved Georgette Heyer's Venetia, so was very excited to add to my collection when this edition came along.  However, as much as I like the story, it turns out this edition has just the regular paper cover, not the glossy one that came on the other editions I purchased (not Harlequin), so it stands out a little bit on the bookshelf.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book, having never read anything by Hamilton before. Also I am not a big reader of this genre. The only similar books I have read were the Twilight series and I was left a little bit disappointed with parts of those. The Forever Girl at first seemed very similar to Twilight but I kept reading and it took off in its own direction that I really loved. The way she created the story of the Supernatural and their part in the Universe was refreshing and very interesting.<br /><br />Character development: GREAT<br />Voice: Refreshing and Unique<br />Plot: Wonderful<br />Dialogue: Probably the best part. It was funny, witty and emotionally real.<br /><br />I fell in love with the characters, especially Sophia. She was intelligent and strong willed and yet vulnerable in a way that we have all felt at some point in our lives. I found myself able to connect with her on an emotional level.<br /><br />Part of the reason why I enjoyed this book far more than the Twilight series, was because of the action. Hamilton does a great job of building the story up to a final conflict and then playing out that scene with some great action that doesn't leave you feeling like, \\"that's it?\\"<br /><br />This book gave me everything I needed emotionally. I felt love, anticipation, anxiety, relief, anger, suspense, and betrayal, just to name a few. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who reads in, and outside of this genre, because Hamilton has made me a believer. I will at the very least continue to read this series and any other book that Hamilton puts out.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Its humorous, its thrilling, its entertaining, and its great DIY film-making. I loved every second of it. The acting was phenomenal. Don't make a huge mistake by skipping this film.
044024367X|4.0|This review is based on the Audible version, narrated by Dick Hill. I don't know what Mr. Hill looks like but I'm sure it is the spitting image of Jack Reacher, as far as I'm concerned Dick Hill IS Reacher. You can't imagine how deeply you can \\"get into\\" a story until you've heard a good narrator speaking the words while you visualize the \\"movie\\" in your head, without having to translate the writing into thoughts (if that makes sense). Nothing to Lose is a typical Reacher story. Plenty of the bad guy's flunky's to break, a good looking girl to pal around with, a simple yet well told plot that throws in few turns just to keep you guessing. The book moves well from start to finish, the cast of character's have believable motivations for acting the way they do, and Reacher ... is Reacher. The political agenda might be a bit off putting for some but others might think it is close to the mark ... as I do. As someone else mentioned, Child isn't Tolstoy, but if you want good action without a lot of complications interfering with the plot, any of Lee Child's Reacher stories will fit the bill and I believe Dick Hill narrates them all. If you think actions speak louder then words, you'll like Reacher and you'll like this one.
0307454568|5.0|My husband got to read this book first.  He owes me big time. I'm now in it and we're eating frozen meals and there's laundry to get done. Great book...read it!
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Absolutely horrible.  Every time I try to run this, it locks my phone up and I have to pull the battery.  FAIL!<br />HTC Inspire 4G
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Honestly, if I could give this book less than one stars I would. The writing is flat, the characters are cardboard cutouts and holy god is this book repetitive. Another reviewer mentioned that reading this book is like watching too much porn, and that is a very apt description of the reading experience. After awhile all you are is bored. All of this is not helped by the fact that the story is told through the gaze of Ana who has to be one of the most unlikely naive pollyanna's I have ever had the displeasure to read about, her vascillating navel gazing is not just boring, it is grating and annoying.
B003ZYJS42|1.0|One of the best hard rock albums in recent years ,no doubt, BUT in my opinion-buy it on CD or simply download it.For some reason vinyl sounds horrible.I was expecting quality of sound close to Music on Vinyl  or may be recent DSD re-issues, especially looking forward to the sound of Bonamassa's guitars and Hughes's bass and voice.Nothing like this happened.Flat,colorless mixing reminded me of some bad monaural recordings from early 60's. I wouldn't mind to pay top dollar once again in case somebody like Bob Ludwig will take care of it, after all in my opinion-this album deserves it.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|AMAZON KINDLE FIRE PROTECTIVE SLEEVE IS GREAT FOR PROTECTION AND MAKES IT EASY TO SLIP KINDLE FIRE IN TO TAKE SOMEWHERE WITHOUT FEAR OF DAMAGE
0515141429|5.0|This story has the frenetic pace of a six-year old boy that consumed two pounds of Halloween candy, gone into hyperglycemic shock, been revived in the middle of the operating room with paddles, and given a shot of adrenaline and a Snickers bar. Jack Reacher, the ultimate man's man, leads the charge. He carries nothing but the clothes on his back, a wad of cash, and a toothbrush jammed in his pocket. After use, he tosses his clothes in the trash, and visits the local thrift store. While they may lack depth, the sentences have a punch that hits harder than Mike Tyson in his prime. The dialogue, while certainly not fancy or flowery, does a more than adequate job of delivering the uppercut.<br /><br />While it may seem farfetched to some, the plot works well with the character, and the small town atmosphere of the south. Revenge is a dish best served cold, and Jack Reacher is one stone cold piece of mastery. It's MANfiction at its finest, and it reaches the ultimate crescendo with more brilliance than a five figure Fourth of July fireworks display.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B006ASALY6|5.0|You don't have to be a BLONDIE fan to enjoy this album, and coincidentally, if you are a BLONDIE fan, it doesn't mean you WILL enjoy this album. Debbie took BLONDIE, funk, and rap, put them in a blender, propelled that mixture into outer space, waited for it to crash land in the middle of NYC, and then put it on record. And there you have, Koo Koo. What's so cool about Debbie Harry?? Well, for one thing she introduced most of America (and the world, for that matter) to rap music without ever presenting herself as anything other than an ultra-white icy blonde chic. She didn't feel the need to change her look or style to a more urban, or blackified, variant of herself. Debbie tossed fame and fortune aside for a very risky career move with Koo Koo - a move which didn't immediately pay off, but like most true artists, as time goes on, her artistic merit is more and more appreciated. The writing is great, the arrangements are great and Debbie sounds beautiful. This album sounded strange and futuristic in 1981 and it still sounds strange and futuristic 30+ years later. One of the coolest record covers of all time encases an even cooler collection of ten songs.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Season 2 is just as awesome as Season 1... Such a wonderful series with great storytelling and rich character development, and one of those shows you never want to see come to an end. Absolutely beautiful watching it in blu-ray. Cannot wait for Season 3!
1401937519|1.0|For years I have read NDEs, although Anita did leave her body and did witness events that were taking place in the hospital, she did not have a full Near Death Experience.  Anita is a Hindu; her interruptation of her experience reflects her Hindu beliefs.<br /><br />I found out about this book on a Wayne Dyer PBS Special.  I am a fan of Mr. Dyer and have many of his books and CD's.  I found this book to be very much the same style and message of almost any of Wayne Dyer's books.  I'm glad Anita found healing in her life; but I do not believe the healing was due to her NDE.  The healing she found most likely came as a result of her interactions with Mr. Dyer.<br /><br />The majority of this book is about Anita's life and the changes she made in her life; there really is not a lot about her short NDE.  If you are buying this book for the NDE, don't spend your money.  If you are interested in the book for the healing factor, I'd recommend one of Wayne Dyer's books.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|The game seems to crash at random times.  It's pretty cool, it's an interesting twist to the previous games.  But, it crashes every few minutes.  Hope they fix it soon, because I'm not likely to buy the paid version if this one won't work right.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this weather app. I have had to delete it, for some reason it tends to force close on my kindle fire. I have it on my blackberry and it works great.
030788743X|5.0|A friend recommended this book for anyone growing up in the 80's and played video games.  He was spot on, it's a very enjoyable read, especially for those of us that are \\"techy\\".  The story moves quickly and is enjoyable, doesn't have the slow start and then rapid-pace-gotta-finish-the-book writing style that often occurs.
B004ZKVEE2|5.0|It was by accident that I stumbled onto the Psy-Changeling series. Originally read Nalini's Guild Hunter series and decided I loved her writing so much that I needed to read more of her books. Reluctant to get into this new world I decided to give it a try. And boy am I glad I did! From the first novel, Slave to Sensation to this, Kiss of Snow, I've been hooked every step of the way! Being a part of every book's relationship mixed with the world they live with has been an exciting journey, and the latest installment, Kiss of Snow, does not disappoint.<br /><br />The building tension between Hawke and Sienna has been felt throughout the other books and finally we get to experience their story. So much anticipation was riding on their story and it could have easily missed expectations. I can happily say that it not only hit the mark, but exceeded expectations. Hawke with his strong alpha vibe and sexy brooding persona, had the makings to overpower the young Sienna, and that couldn't be more wrong. Sienna is such a strong female character, she can more the hold her own - I alsmot forgot at times that she's only 19. Hawke and Sienna's chemistry is the most explosive by far and it was great that the other character from past books were part of this story as well.<br /><br />Highly reccommend this book - but only after you've read all of the other books first. It's well worth the journey and I can't wait for the next book. It's back to reality until then :-)
B0063GORYU|5.0|Awesome game. I can't quit playing. The ads can be annoying but it is free game so really can't complain too much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am an avid reader, and very rarely will I write a review, as what I like may not be for someone else. My reading ranges from romance to espionage, to detective, military, history, biographies... (I don't limit myself).  But I've finished this trilogy.  And yes you have to read all 3, in order.  The first one leaves you hanging the second one leaves you wanting more.  The third one has an epilogue that should really be a chapter.  Even if you are not into the hard core sex that is apart of this trilogy, the story line is just amazing.  What this character (Christian) went through as a young boy.  And you don't really learn everything till you read all three books.  You basically learn bits and pieces through each one.  And how Ana is actually a brave heroine to subject herself to some of this stuff for love.  You can skip the hard core stuff, but as bad as some of it is, you read it, just to understand the characters just a bit.  But after awhile, you can skim some it if it really grosses you out.  I read all three books in less then 5 days.  The emails, I found well done.  (correspondence between the two main characters).  I enjoyed reading them.  And you can't skim them, you have to read from the subject line right through the signature line.  I think I've found a new author to add to my wish list.  Very well done, even the hard core stuff even though I'm not into BDSM..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun games love some of the oldies but goodies. cheaper than buying single games especially since they are free.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Super movie with a lot of Historical Truth!  Young people should watch this movie to understand the dangers and the glory our space adventures stirred inside us. I hope people in the Govt. can feel this outside of the current political agenda. Just Great!

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun game and not so much of a challenge that stress or frustration ensues.  Recommend highly as a relaxing bit of escape from the daily grind.  Especially enjoy the availability of hints when one finds ones self in a wheelspin.  Navigation, retry function, and general design are first rate.  Great artwork as well.

0545405777|5.0|It is so great I read the whole series in two days.  It's a must read.  And like Jennifer Lawrence says we don't drink blood(twilight) that's sick.  Its nothing like twilight. Its a book for all ages.very entertaining.  Yes theres sides like who katniss really likes but it's not just about love.  It's about rebelling and the struggles the caracters are going threw.  It's not repeat not the importance of having a boyfriend.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Life Changing.  A terrific book, well written, great read. A must read for future leaders, current leaders, future innovators, and working parents. RIP.

1612130283|1.0|There was a blurb in the paper yesterday about a book called Fifty Shades of Grey. The woman said it wasn't especially well written but said it seemed to be the current Must Read amongst women. She did admit to it being very erotic and how the partners of women everywhere would be reaping the benefits of them reading it.<br /><br />Well, sounded like a fun bit of fluff to entertain me for a day or two so I downloaded it.<br /><br />And FFS!<br /><br />The start is pure hideous Mills and Boon. It was very hard to keep going, but I did because I was waiting for the good bits to start.<br /><br />And when they did they were so bad I kept reading to see when the REAL good bits would start.<br /><br />After pages and pages of ridiculous and completely NON erotic sex, I deleted the stupid thing right off my Kindle.<br /><br />Seriously, it's like the hype for that mind blowingly bad \\"The Bride Stripped Bare\\" all over again. It's badly written, not even vaguely convincing and the sex is just, Meh, whatever.<br /><br />I read plenty of books where the sex bits give my tired old libido a stir, but this book was basically a big fat literary soft on.<br /><br />Don't bother, ladies, don't bother.<br /><br />PS -  We should be able to rate this book ZERO stars!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game to play.  have to do well to continue on. keeps my attention. basic but still seems to be challenging.
B001AKF3H4|5.0|great hits and everything I remember Whitney Houston's voice to be. it is amazing and so nice here her voice in so many of her hits. this was a great movie with her in it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! Jane Austin it is not, but then that is not what I was looking for. I have read and enjoyed all three books in the series. I was really sucked into the story I love both Ana and Christian. The story flowed really well and I enjoyed it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I must admit, I wouldn't have chosen to read this book on my own.  A member of the book club I belong to said it had great ratings and might be a good read.  This book is about living, loving, and dying.  I'm a grandmother, definitely not a teenager, yet I learned so much.  It emphasized living in the moment because we never know when we are having our last good day.  It demonstrated parent/child love as well as the loving relationship between Hazel and Augustus.  Lastly, I learned about dying with dignity and what I can do to help others in their journey.

0307593495|1.0|I have read every Wallander book in the series in order and was a 5 star fan until this one. The novels have been wonderful representations of the detail, drudgery, creativity and excitement of great police work.  Kurt Wallander has embodied the brilliance as well as the human foibles of real policemen, particularly detectives who make so many personal sacrifices to achieve a just resolution to a crime. This novel does fascinate up to a point, as it moves along as an extra-professional mission of Kurt Wallander's - a family related quest handled entirely on his \\"vacation.\\"  The reader receives a farewell tour of sorts involving some of the important personages of past stories.  However, in contrast to the other books in the series, I thought that the resolution was telegraphed well before the end and was disappointing, flat and flawed; and I don't care that Mankell asserts it was based on real events.  I could have gotten past that.  But oh my dear Kurt, you deserved so much better than what your creator did to you in the end.  Shameful, downright shameful.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars is an amazing book that shows how everyone can overcome their faults and learn from one another. The protagonists are two teenagers who have terminal cancer, although are kept alive by the treatments they are being given. There names are Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace. They meet in a cancer AA type group and become very close friends, learning of each others illness, struggles, aspirations and finding a common median that comes from a book.<br /><br />Both of them are extremely touched by this book, however the story and meaning of it ends abruptly prompting them to search for the author. They find the author who lives in Amsterdam and through miraculous events are able to meet him, craving for the ending and meaning of his book.<br /><br />This book is MORE than a \\"what the meaning of life is.\\" It shows how all of us have faults and nobody is perfect. Maybe, just maybe our faults are predetermined in the stars and its how we learn to live with them, rather than change them is what makes us who we are.

0451232577|1.0|I really loved-- I mean LOVED -- Follett's previous novels-- Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. So you can imagine how excited I was to read this next book.<br /><br />Well, 300 pages later, and I cannot get over how dreadfully boring this is. I'm no professional book critic -- just someone who likes reading novels -- so I don't have the proper words to describe what's wrong with this book other than to say that it's incredibly boring. If I want to fall asleep, all I have to do is open this book and within 5 minutes I'm bored to tears. The effect is something similar to opening my high school chemistry textbook or maybe staring at cement dry.<br /><br />Sometimes I start reading it, only to realize an hour later that I had already been through that entire section-- that's how totally unmemorable each and every chapter of this book is.<br /><br />I've tried finding a single character with whom I could sympathize, to no avail. I'm not looking for some heroic icon or remarkable woman/man of intellect, just someone with a modicum of emotional depth or maybe who doesn't come across like a stepford wife or boorish lout. They do not exist in this book.<br /><br />I kind of find it hard to believe that this is even the same author who wrote the other books I so loved.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I liked the fact that Adobe platforms are supported on Android and is very useful for tablets. I don't want companies to be rejected in an ecosystem of different vendors. People should have option to run software, they may not be preinstalled, but for people understanding the risks it is better to give options. In Apple ecosystem,. Adobe is banned. But in Android it can be installed if required and is quite useful for many people.

B004SOR4H6|2.0|Compared to tweetcaster Pro which is excellent, I am kind of shocked official twitter app lacks that find of a finish. I am sure twitter has manpower to write great apps, probably they are interested in the back end and getting the right kind of APIs to developers who can develope their own. In that regard they have succeeded very much.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are decent some are very easy also kills time when you have nothing to do overall not bad to play

B0058RCVYS|5.0|I wasn't sure how much I was going to like the movie.  The plot sounded intriguing, but with subtitles.... Not only did the subtitles along with some English dialogue flow very well together, I almost found myself unaware of the subtitles.  With that detail out of the way, the movie itself and the acting were superb.  I am so glad I experienced it.
B005HSL626|3.0|very addicting app, but the video commercials are kind of dumb. i can be right in the middle of a game and one will start. sometimes I can just hit back and still play, but sometimes I have to shut down the whole app to start again. but otherwise, very fun and I try to get stuff on senseis swag every day.
1423140591|5.0|My grandson (now 14) and I have read all the Percy Jackson series and were very disappointed when there were no more. Then this new series started, \\"The Heroes of Olympus\\" - Book One, \\"The Lost Hero\\" which we read and couldn't wait until \\"The Son of Neptune\\" came out this past November. It is kind of hard to write without spoiling the book. Just let me say that the book is just as good and exciting as all the rest with new characters and adventures. You will meet lots of new monsters and won't revisit the places in the first books like Hades. Rick Riordan has a fantastic imagination and my grandson and I have fun trying to predict how the adventurers will solve a particular problem. You won't be disappointed in this book. We can't wait till the next one in the fall of 2012. While we wait, we are reading the \\"H.I.V.E. series by Mark Walden which is excellent and quite different, but my grandson loves it. We are about to start the second in the series now.

0439813786|5.0|I had seen these books in a Middle School library and they were so thick that I couldn't imagine the kids actually reading them but they were constantly being checked out. When I worked at the Book Fair at the school, I flipped through one. A great percentage of the pages do not have writing but tell the story with pictures which is quite ingenious. The pictures are wonderful and are drawn by the author. The books were about $25 at the Book Fair but  I got it on Amazon quite a bit cheaper. I couldn't put it down and read it in one day. My daughter read it to my 7 year old grandson and he loved it and was so excited when he watched the movie. She said, while they were reading the book, he would want to know how big the clock was and other questions. He was glued to the front of the TV watching the movie and knew a lot of stuff from the book. So if a 70 year old grandma, oodles of middle school kids and teachers, and a 7 year old loved it, it has to be good. It is the story of a small boy whose father is killed in an accident and he has to live with his drunken uncle who tends the clocks in a railway station and also lives there. It is kind of a cinderella story in that the boy doesn't have a bed and has to do the work for the uncle. There is no fairy godmother though. After the uncle disappears, the boys has to keep up the clocks so they won't find him and take him to an orphanage. There is a automaton (sp) that his father was working on and the boy is trying to get it running. How all this takes place and the boy finds a home is what the story is about. Try it, you'll like it!!!
B006P0FIGU|5.0|I saw this the weekend it came out in theaters and just loved it! It is a wonderful retelling! It has a great combination of action, comedy and drama. I couldn't wait for the dvd to come out because I was dying to see it again.
B000025802|5.0|My favorite 9th is the 1990 von Donhnanyi, which, to me, comprises one of the best interpretations combined with among the best recording engineering. It's my favorite of the several that I have. For all the other Dvorak symphonies, I only have one CD of each, different artists for different symphonies, some better than others. But each time I feel like listening to any one of the 1st through the 8th, I always find myself turning to (what I think is) my old LP version of this set, which was issued in 1973 as a special edition to commemorate the 75th anniversary of DGG. What it lacks in sonic clarity it makes up for in artistic quality. While the sound stage leaves much to be desired,  the quality of miking and mixing is second to none.<br /><br />I think old Antonin would have played it this way; the interpretation just sounds right.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I would like this app, but there is one problem.<br /><br />This app does not tell you how to download the videos!!!!!<br /><br />Other than that, it also acts like a virus.

190669415X|5.0|The book arrived quickly and in good condition, as described by the poster.  As a result, I have no complaints!  Also, VERY good book!
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I just downloaded this on my iPad with the kindle app and while the title was in focus the pages were slightly, but noticeably blurry.  I must say though that I 'returned' it immediately with no problems, something I didn't even know you could do.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|I was surprised at how short this work was.  It was as if Sam didn't want to have to get into a lot of detailed explanations or anecdotal evidence, so most of what he puts forth is only implied or demonstrated indirectly.  I would like to have seen a more detailed presentation of what a small part of our reality and existence is played out and known to us through our consciousness.  What/who we actually are is so much more than our experience of consciousness.  I think Sam would have done a much better job sharing what he knows to be true ... that we (not unlike a computer) are an amalgam of background processes controlling and driving us from behind a curtain.
B002J8LVO0|5.0|U2<br /><br />The Unforgettable Fire<br /><br />This one has a few huge hits, but not everything on it fits together well.  I have never been able to warn up to `Promenade' or `Elvis Presley and America', but this remains a beautiful album and certainly an important one in the development of 1980's music.  It deserves 4 ½ stars but I will give it Five.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Works well on the LG Optimus V. Fun twist on the classic app. I'm not sure why there's a word minimum but this sentence helps me reach it.
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|So I love the series, I absolutely do.  That's why I figured I would by the blu ray and support it.  However, the blu ray arrived at my house (kudos to Amazon for helping with a minor issue there by the way) and its unplayable on my computer.  Turns out the DRM requires a HDCP monitor and a digital connection.  Now I understand yes piracy is a large issue, but when you make it impossible for people who actually buy the product to use it, that may be a good reason why that way has become a LOT more popular.<br /><br />So the TL:DR<br /><br />Don't purchase this, the DRM is terrible and there is a possibility doing the right thing can come back to haunt you.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I give this telling of the Planet of the Apes saga a 4 stars mostly because of the long hours and hard work that must have been spent creating the CGI apes.<br /><br />The CGI is impressive in an artistic way, but not so much in a realistic way.<br /><br />I don't know if it was intentional, or simply the limitations of computer animation at this time in history ,,, but at no time do you feel the ape characters are real.<br />They are always un-realistic looking ........... but yet, I still find the animation impressive in an artistic, expressive way.<br /><br />The over all movie is a bit less than 4 stars.<br /><br />The story has some logic flaws in many places.<br />The acting from many of the human actors seems stiff and \\"phoned in\\".<br /><br />The editing is a bit choppy.<br /><br />Nothing really wrong .... but just something that gives the movie a bit of a 'cut and paste\\" feel as opposed to a smooth compelling story.<br /><br />My biggest complaint ?<br /><br />The overall mood of the movie was not serious enough.<br /><br />I always felt Planet of the Apes universe had a darker mood and commentary about human society and social issues.<br /><br />This film seems to be kind of comical, light hearted and goofy all the way thru, even during what are intended to be heavy and serious scenes.<br /><br />It feels \\"too Hollywood formula\\" and bouncy and light-hearted.<br /><br />It is good family entertainment and certainly demonstrated long hours of hard work, but it feels like the producers relied on the CGI to carry the film and simply glossed over the other parts of the film.<br /><br />I am happy to see it made good $$$$ as I always like to see hard work get rewarded.<br /><br />We enjoyed the movie, but it did not impart a lasting impression and will not be added to our DVD collection.<br />I doubt I would ever watch it again.<br /><br />I know this review seems a little \\"Jeckyl and Hyde\\".<br /><br />I guess I respect the hard work that went into making this movie, and I WANTED to be more excited about it...............  but when all is said and done, when the movie was over there was no \\"WOW\\" factor or desire to order a copy for our own DVD collection.<br /><br />But certainly worth a watchovie, and I WANTED to be more excited about it...............  but when all is said and done, when the movie was over there was no \\"WOW\\" factor or desire to order a copy for our own DVD collection.<br /><br />But certainly worth a watch
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The final leg of The Hunger Games trilogy is easily the weakest. There's nothing wrong with the writing, naturally, but the pacing and scenario aren't nearly as captivating as what was presented in the first two books. Still worth reading, but keep your expectations low.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|This \\"time is money\\" movie is a variation on the Logans Run idea with a little bit of modern political commentary thrown in.<br /><br />The premise was good and actually the first 40 minutes was interesting .... but then it quickly fell into repeated chase scenes, one liner jokes, and stopped being a serious heavy sci-fi movie and more of a Hollywood formula film
1451627289|4.0|I enjoyed the book, I thought it was interesting and thought provoking. I hope it is made into a movie.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This is the continuation of the Crawley saga, that most lush and endearing prime time soap opera which only the British can pull-off. If you're reading this, you're already hooked. WWI has begun; the estate is handing over fit men to the British army from both upstairs and down. Some won't come back ... except for that nasty piece of work, Thomas. Only the good die young. Downton Abbey has joined the war effort by turning the house (?!) into a convalescence hospital for wounded officers at Isobel Crawley's insistence/persistence. And if the war is not enough, here comes the \\"Spanish Flu\\" epidemic to kill off the young, the old, and the recovering wounded.<br /><br />Sir Richard Carlisle makes Lady Mary an offer of marriage she can't refuse (cf. The Godfather) although she's still holding a torch for Mathew; Edith finds her niche, for a while, driving a farm tractor; Sybil is nursing, and flirting with the Tom, the chauffeur. Cora gets the flu, Robert, Earl of Grantham resents being superfluous, Vera is still making Bates' and Anna's lives a study in frustration, and Daisy marries William. Anymore of this kind of synopsis would make it a spoiler.<br /><br />Julian Fellowes (creator of the series) has found funding for another season (3rd) due to world demand, I suspect. The filming can't be cheap with all its authentic touches. If you have any money left after gassing-up your car buy \\"The World of Downton Abbey\\" by Jessica Fellowes, Julian's wife. [[ASIN:1250006341 The World of Downton Abbey]] The photos are wonderful, the text is informative, and (many times) the actors' comments are a giggle. It'll help tide you over until Season 3 crosses The Pond to PBS.
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|Awesome album! Haven't gotten to side B yet because side A is Soo good. I recommend this album to anyone with any music genre interest! buy it now and enjoy! I bet you can't listen to it without nodding your head..!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've not had any of the video ads other reviewers refer to, thankfully; if I have problems with a free app, I always return to note it in the review, then the app gets deleted.  I hope that won't be the outcome with this Solitaire game because I like it.  Not a fussy game that tries to be every solitaire game out there, just an easy to play game that everyone is familiar with.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|We are only on the second season of Dr Quinn but I am enjoying each one. I am enjoying them even more now than I did when it ran on tv.<br />This set came with 2 movies -\\"Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Movie\\" & \\"Dr Quinn, The Heart Within\\" I am also enjoying the special features.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful story line and acting.  Movie worth viewing and owning....just ask the rest of the world, being sold in 28 different countries.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Some have criticized \\"The Help\\" and its depiction of racism as way too easy on the eye and cheery on the ear - slyly dodging the 'physically' violent reality of segregation in 1960's Southern America in favour of entertainment. But I think that's being massively unfair to the movie's genuine achievement - it's brilliant portrayal of the 'mental' apartheid levelled every day at black people - which ran hand-in-hand with the opposite side of the coin - the love given to white children by black maids.<br /><br />Adapted from Kathryn Stockett's book and Directed by Tate Taylor in 2011 - \\"The Help\\" has a virtual flood of truly blistering performances from black and white actresses at the top of their game - women given meaty material they want to do justice to. It's resulted in global box office success and a whopping 53 nominations - followed by as many wins (BAFTA and OSCAR included).<br /><br />While Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Aunjanue Ellis have rightly been praised for their layered portrayals - I was blown away by the most difficult role of all - that of the odious Hilly Holbrook played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She is awesome as a truly hateful white woman with meanness literally hardwired into her DNA. Hilly Holbrook sits in her car and spitefully takes pleasure as she watches a black maid who crossed her be arrested by white cops - in the bathroom she marks the individual toilet sheets with a pen to see if her black maid crosses that sanitation line. Jessica Chastain too as the blonde and ample social outcast Celia Foote - who is perceived as a husband robber but is just lost - another belter of a performance. Lesley Jordan as a mouthy newspaper editor, Sissy Spacek as a mentally ailing mum, Mary Steenburgen as a New York book editor - so many class acts.<br /><br />The story goes like this - a headstrong 22-year Southern gal called Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan decides to become a real writer (anything to avoid her mother's constant scheming towards marriage). Her subject matter is going to be the black maids who raised the white children of Alabama and their side of the story. The author will be 'Anonymous' and the book will be entitled \\"The Help\\". But of course because of fear and intimidation it doesn't prove easy to document and the journey tests Skeeter's loyalties and personal courage to the maximum too (spot-on casting in the lovely and hugely talented Emma Stone). It proves even more traumatic to her 'one-of-the-gals' mother Charlotte (a stupendous turn from Allison Janney) who makes a staggeringly crass mistake on the back of white peer pressure. But to get started - Skeeter needs a cohort. So when a middle-aged maid she knows gets fired - Skeeter gets her first interviewee. Giving a deeply humane performance, Viola Davis plays Aibileen Clark. Aibileen is 53 and works 8am to 4pm six days a week for peanuts money servicing husband and wife Raphael and Elizabeth Leefolt. She's also a full-time nanny to young Mae Mobley Leefolt their 3-year old daughter (she's mothered 17 children in her life). Aibileen has also lost her grown-up son Treelore to haphazard white working practices and now her job over a trumped-up 'theft of silver' charge. But she loves children - and even when useless mom Elizabeth callously fires her - Aibileen grabs the vulnerable and hurting child Mae Mobley - and in tears - reiterates her mantra of life positivity to her (those words title this review).<br /><br />Aibileen's best friend is Minny Jackson - an ace cook and rotund force of nature (despite her husband's occasional beatings). After a hilarious incident involving pie and a non-nutritional substance contained within it (a really great joke that is milked for a good twenty minutes) - she too becomes involved (an unbelievably powerful and committed Octavia Spencer). Skeeter's nanny is the elderly and wise Constantine (beautifully played by veteran actress Cicely Tyson) - a source of love, encouragement and constancy in Skeeter's life. Herdisappearance after 29 years service brings Skeeter face to face with her own mother's terrible attitudes...<br /><br />Speaking of the darker side - there are scenes in \\"The Help\\" that genuinely shock. Black people forced to use the 'colored entrance' at the side of a cinema - rich beauty-parlour white mothers talking about diseases being passed from negroes to their white children through toilets - and worst of all - the chilling reading out of the \\"Mississippi\\" Law Book with its craftily-worded segregation tactics and Jim Crow rules that will literally have you wincing in your seat in disbelief.<br /><br />Filmed on location in Greenwood, Mississippi - the homes and interiors are all real - and Stephen Goldblatt's incredible cinematography of the local scenery gives all of its 146 minutes a deeply rich hue. Better still - it's defaulted to 1.85:1 aspect ratio - so the picture fills your entire screen (no bars top or bottom). It means that the BLU RAY image is full-on beautiful all of the time. Add to this a gorgeous and emotive score by THOMAS NEWMAN (\\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"Green Mile\\", \\"The Road To Perdition\\" etc) and the whole thing feels special the moment it opens. The only downer for me came at the film's end in the form of the ubiquitous saccharine ballad - 'Living Proof' by Mary J. Blige. It would have been far better to simply play out to Newman's affecting music - and classier too.<br /><br />EXTRAS: even though it's only 24 minutes long - the 'Making Of' is genuinely informative and even moving in places. The Author Kathryn Stockett and Director Tate Taylor are from Jackson, Mississippi and have known each other since childhood. More importantly they both came from broken homes and had black maids whom they loved and admired. It was a story they felt had to be told. Combining this with the magic touch of Steven Spielberg (one of the Executive Producers) - and you begin to understand why and how the lovely tone of the film was achieved and maintained - the right people were let do the job and not some Hollywood name. At just under 12 minutes duration - the 'In Their Own Words...' extra where Tate Taylor and Octavia Spencer talk to real 'Maids of Mississippi' is too short - but what there is of it - is wonderfully insightful and uplifting.<br /><br />To sum up - touching, funny, horrifying and ultimately moving - \\"The Help\\" blew my family and myself away.<br /><br />Well done to Kathryn Stockett, Tate Taylor, DreamWorks and all the good souls who fought to see it made.<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />PICTURE: 1080p High Def, 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio<br />AUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1; French, Spanish and Russian Dolby Digital 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English SDH, French, Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian<br />EXTRAS:<br />1.

B00785P2QC|5.0|very exciting! I love strategy games especially ones that let me build my very own city the way I want to build it! I would recommend this game to all my friends and anyone else.
B004S2XL9I|5.0|This is a wonderful and inspiring bedtime story! I enjoy reading this to my son even though my son is grown. He turns 19 on May 17. My son is autistic and he enjoys any little thing I do for him. Even this simple little classic bedtime story.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|So far, so good.  By the seventh level, you get the feeling it could use some more puzzles.  That being said, much of the dialogue is at least mildly entertaining. ;-)
0439023513|5.0|After reading this book I feel like I do when I watch a documentary...the ending is unsatisfying, everyone didn't live happily ever after, but some people have picked up the pieces and moved on.  It was excellent, a cookie cutter ending would have been sweet but empty.  Instead Ms. Collins made her characters human, their suffering real and leaves it up to us to determine if it was worthwhile.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I'm enjoying the game very much!  The graphics are adorable; the squirrel is always cheerful and ready to play.  I'm glad I opted for this download when it came up as a freebie.
1416550550|4.0|If I could give this book 3.5 stars I would, but the rating system doesn't allow for it.  Although the story was interesting, I felt that it dragged on in parts and was predictable in some places.  Also, it seemed like there were stories within the story and although it seemed intriguing at times, it got old. There was too much going on with the various characters; most characters in this story have some sort of drama or tragedy.  Anyway, it was interesting and there were several parts where I didn't want to put it down so overall I'd say it is worth the read.

B0072X2NUS|4.0|This album was released with little fanfare considering who its two members are and the fact that it is a reunion of sorts.  Martin Gore, the engine beyond Depeche Mode and Vince Clarke, the brains behind Yaz, Erasure and Depeche Mode (before Gore took the reins) have released a really, really good electronic dance music album but don't expect it to sound anything like a Depeche Mode or Erasure album.  Once you move past what you expect the music to sound like and just accept the music on its terms, you will be deeply rewarded. On first listen, it sounds like your typical techno/EDM track but repeated listens give way to why these two are masters at crafting songs.  EDM usually is about repetitiveness, but why this music grows on you is the way they slowly introduce new ideas to each song and musically take you on a journey through each track.<br /><br />You're just going to have to wait for the next Depeche or Erasure album to get your fix but in the meantime, this is a wonderful diversion for your late night dance party, morning commute or while reading your newspaper with a good cup of coffee.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I enjoy erotica and heard so much about this book that I had to give it a shot, but I'm five chapters in and just can't take it anymore.  This has to be the most appallingly atrocious writing I've ever seen in a major release.  The pseudonymous British author sets the action (such as it is) in Washington State... for no reason than that her knowledge of America apparently consists of what she read in \\"Twilight\\"... but the entire first-person narrative is filled with Britishisms.  How many American college students do you know who talk about \\"prams,\\" \\"ringing\\" someone on the phone, or choosing a \\"smart rucksack\\" to take \\"on holiday\\"?  And the author's geography sounds like she put together a jigsaw puzzle of the Pacific Northwest while drunk and ended up with several pieces in the wrong place.<br /><br />And oh, the repetition...and the repetition...and the repetition.  I'm convinced the author has a computer macro that she hits to insert one of her limited repertoire of facial expressions whenever she needs one.  According to my Kindle search function, characters roll their eyes 41 times, Ana bites her lip 35 times, Christian's lips \\"quirk up\\" 16 times, Christian \\"cocks his head to one side\\" 17 times, characters \\"purse\\" their lips 15 times, and characters raise their eyebrows a whopping 50 times.  Add to that 80 references to Ana's anthropomorphic \\"subconscious\\" (which also rolls its eyes and purses its lips, by the way), 58 references to Ana's \\"inner goddess,\\" and 92 repetitions of Ana saying some form of \\"oh crap\\" (which, depending on the severity of the circumstances, can be intensified to \\"holy crap,\\" \\"double crap,\\" or the ultimate \\"triple crap\\").  And this is only part one of a trilogy...<br /><br />If I wrote like that, I'd use a pseudonym too.<br /><br />Like some other reviewers, what I find terribly depressing is that this is a runaway bestseller and the movie rights are expected to sell for up to $5 million.  There are so many highly talented writers in the genre... and erotica is so much more erotic when the author has a command of the language and can make you care about the characters.  For examples, check out the \\"Beauty\\" trilogy written by Anne Rice under the pen name A.N. Roquelaure, or any stories by Donna George Storey or Rachel Kramer Bussel.  Just stay away from this triple crap.<br /><br />*UPDATE*: Thanks to the many other perturbed readers who have shared their own choices of the most annoyingly overused phrases in this masterpiece.  Following up on their suggestions with my ever-useful Kindle search function, I have discovered that Ana says \\"Jeez\\" 81 times and \\"oh my\\" 72 times.  She \\"blushes\\" or \\"flushes\\" 125 times, including 13 that are \\"scarlet,\\" 6 that are \\"crimson,\\" and one that is \\"stars and stripes red.\\"  (I can't even imagine.)  Ana \\"peeks up\\" at Christian 13 times, and there are 9 references to Christian's \\"hooded eyes,\\" 7 to his \\"long index finger,\\" and 25 to how \\"hot\\" he is (including four recurrences of the epic declarative sentence \\"He's so freaking hot.\\").  Christian's \\"mouth presses into a hard line\\" 10 times.  Characters \\"murmur\\" 199 times, \\"mutter\\" 49 times, and \\"whisper\\" 195 times (doesn't anyone just talk?), \\"clamber\\" on/in/out of things 21 times, and \\"smirk\\" 34 times.  Christian and Ana also \\"gasp\\" 46 times and experience 18 \\"breath hitches,\\" suggesting a need for prompt intervention by paramedics.  Finally, in a remarkable bit of symmetry, our hero and heroine exchange 124 \\"grins\\" and 124 \\"frowns\\"... which, by the way, seems an awful lot of frowning for a woman who experiences \\"intense,\\" \\"body-shattering,\\" \\"delicious,\\" \\"violent,\\" \\"all-consuming,\\" \\"turbulent,\\" \\"agonizing\\" and \\"exhausting\\" orgasms on just about every page.e genre... and erotica is so much more erotic when the author has a command of the language and can make you care about the characters.

Ana \\"peeks up\\" at Christian 13 times, and there are 9 references to Christian's \\"hooded eyes,\\" 7 to his \\"long index finger,\\" and 25 to how \\"hot\\" he is (including four recurrences of the epic declarative sentence \\"He's so freaking hot.\\").  Christian's \\"mouth presses into a hard line\\" 10 times.  Characters \\"murmur\\" 199 times, \\"mutter\\" 49 times, and \\"whisper\\" 195 times (doesn't anyone just talk?), \\"clamber\\" on/in/out of things 21 times, and \\"smirk\\" 34 times.  Christian and Ana also \\"gasp\\" 46 times and experience 18 \\"breath hitches,\\" suggesting a need for prompt intervention by paramedics.  Finally, in a remarkable bit of symmetry, our hero and heroine exchange 124 \\"grins\\" and 124 \\"frowns\\"... which, by the way, seems an awful lot of frowning for a woman who experiences \\"intense,\\" \\"body-shattering,\\" \\"delicious,\\" \\"violent,\\" \\"all-consuming,\\" \\"turbulent,\\" \\"agonizing\\" and \\"exhausting\\" orgasms on just about every page.

0312567448|4.0|Like any teenage girl who idolizes the Carrie Bradshaw, Charlotte, Samantha Jones, and Miranda clique I try to get my hands on anything and everything that can connect me to one of these amazing girls. Already a devoted fan to the TV series, I was thrilled to find out I could sit in a theater and watch these girls and the handsome Big for a whole two hours. And like any fantasizing teenage girl--curious about love and life--the movie scored big time in my heart.<br />  Sure I loved the wedding preparations and the dresses and the best friends will always be there for you theme of it all but my two favorite scenes had nothing to do with that. I loved the scene where Carrie pulled out a five inch thick library book of love letters by the world's most famous and infamous men: kings, emperors, writers, actors, and timeless celebrities alike. The book seemed so wonderful: a pathway for Carrie to find out \\"what you do when you're already found love.\\" Then, there was the scene where she finds Big has sent her all those letters: Voltaire's, Napoleon's, Beethoven's, etc. and I knew I had to get this book.<br />  And so, I placed a hold for it at my county library. I waited three weeks before I decided I was not going to wait anymore. I called my sister one night on her way home and instructed her to get me Ursula Doyle's Love Letters of Great Men. I ran to the door when she got home and she passed me the Barnes and Nobles bag and it was not heavy at all. I looked in and there was a bright blue book cover wrapped around a hardcover book maybe one inch thick. I have to say I was upset. I wanted Carrie's 500 page version! However, I did not lose hope. I opened the book up and began to read. The font was big but I took a deep breath and told myself, \\"Be Carrie.\\"<br />  I began to read, and read, and read. I could not put it down for a second. Henry VIII had a heart? Voltaire was in love? Alexander Pope was a womanizer? The words of these men--beautiful and elegant and perfect baffled me. I am a history buff and in these letters I saw another side of these great men who changed our world; a side the history books don't tell us about. They were in love. I felt a connection with these great men--they were human, too. That was the great thing about this book. Sure it was not Carrie's gigantic masterpiece but it still was what I had wanted. It was love letters by history's greatest. The book took away all their medals and honors and prestige and stripped these men down to their bare hearts.<br />  If there was one aspect that I had to pick out of the book that I loved the most, it was Beethoven's letters. Doyle's selection was prefect. The best three letters out of the entire book were his, followed by Napoleon at a close second win. Especially with these two men, Doyle's selection was perfect. They were real; they had a story; they had a purpose; they had soul, passion, and above all else, pure devoted love. F. Scott Fitzgerald and Orson Wells had a few good but other than these two others, no other specific person stood out to me as clearly. All selections were very good however what all others lacked was their story aspect. Some of Doyle's collections just seemed like a pile of randomly picked letters--not something with depth and understanding.<br />  Another improvement would be on her small biographies for each lover. They focused on who the man was rather than the books main theme: LOVE! I wanted to know Scott and Zelda's love story. I wanted to know Napoleon and Josephine's fairytale. I wanted to know why these letters were so important to these people. I want to know why the love was so important. If I did connecting would have happened on a greater and deeper level.<br />  Above all, this book was sweet and inspiring. Like any teenage girl, I am constantly dreaming about love and the future. These letters have me a small reminder that when it all comes, it'll be worth the wait. Maybe my Mr. Right will even write me a letter or two. I'll cross my fingers.<br />-LAA
0307269752|5.0|It deserves more than 5 stars. Way more!  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo certainly left a mark on my mind. A good one. I loved Lisbeth Salander's strong, mysterious character. She's a 24-year old gifted hacker but the thrilling, suspenseful storyline kept me reading until I finished the book. I could not put it down. I had to find out about the ending. Love it! Highly recommend it! Great storytelling. Great writng. One of the best books I've read this year!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I so love this game! there are sp many mini games thy keep toy on your toes and ready for anything
B00001OH7O|1.0|This album is overrated, literally. The fact that this album has higher marks then Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars is crazy. It is nowhere as good, not even close.<br /><br />It's not for casual fans, its got some good tracks, but it's really arty and doesn't have a lot of jamming or rock. It's more of a serious fan album, but not a completist album, it's better then that.<br /><br />Basically skip this one unless you love Bowie. Start with Ziggy, Aladdin, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station To Station, Scary Monsters, or Let's Dance, there are just so many Bowie Albums better then this one.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|First of all, I am qualified to speak about the accuracy of this movie and the actions of the persons characterized.<br />Don't waste your money.  Red Box it for a $1 if you want an evening of mindless inaccurate entertainment.<br />This movie is 100% inaccurate in all regards with the exception of the language of the roughnecks.<br />Prudue Bay/Deadhorse is alcohol free(mostly). Firearms are not allowed. (to be carried freely as portraied at the beginning.)<br />You never leave your plane crash site unless it is unstable.<br />The plane would have been tracked to within 1 mile of the crash site.<br />The plane provided protection and resources.  They abandoned it.<br />The roughnecks where protraied as criminals and mindless, mental whimps.  Not true.<br />The roughnecks all go through survival training for events like that.<br />The wolves would have fed on the dead bodies opposed to attacking live ones. (Easier source of food without the danger of injury getting/eating it)<br />It was protrayed that the wolves where out for revenge/sport. Wolves don't possess that mental quality.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|WHAT IT IS:<br />Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is based on a novel by John le Carre (an expert Spy Thriller author); it was once before adapted into a television series; and now it's been adapted into a star-studded film by director Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In--great film, by the way), starring Gary Oldman (who was rightfully nominated an oscar for his performance), Tom Hardy (Inception), Mark Strong (Kiss Ass), John Hurt, Toby Jones (The Mist, Captain America), Colin Firth, Ciaran Hinds, and Benedict Cumberbatch. Essentially the cast is the equivalent of New Years Eve or Valentine's Day, but with British male actors that target a male audience.<br /><br />PREMISE:<br />As a fan of Christopher Nolan, I can tell you that I was lost a lot in this film. A lot of it was the terminology (Circus, for instance, which has an essential meaning in the plot, except I never fully understood what \\"Circus\\" was--and no, not a carnival like circus), but that's only a very small gripe. The essential story is that John Hurt's character thinks there's a mole and he dies and only a few people know that he knew about the mole and it was about the mole trying to cover up his tracks and Smiley (Oldman), who came out of retirement for this sort of personal assingment, trying to figure out who the mole is . . . and then Tom Hardy's character has a significant role, but at first it's hard to understand why he has a significant role (and explaining further would be a spoiler); so it's a cluttery mix of \\"what's going on?\\" premises. But that's the point, isn't it?<br /><br />The point being--with the complexity of the story, the terminology that characters use (without really explaining them), and the essentially trippy way in which the film was edited together--it's hard to follow, and hard to understand.<br /><br />MY THEATER REACTION / REWATCHING ON BLU-RAY:<br />As a fan of Oldman and Hardy, I really enjoyed their acting in the film. I knew from watching it (before Oscar buzz) that Gary Oldman was going to be nominated. But, even though I had seen the film during the day, I felt exhausted upon exiting the theater. It IS a slow film. There's some suspence, but nothing life-threatening. None of the character's live's are on the line, not for a moment. You trust Smiley to find the mole, and the outcome is predictable enough (although \\"who\\" the mole is isn't necessarily so predictable).<br /><br />Then, on Blu-Ray, first and foremost, there aren't many features, so you might as well buy the DVD instead and save yourself a few dollars (at least I wish I would have done that), but if money's not an issue, then buy the Blu-Ray. It's just not one of the \\"must have\\" blu-ray movies, like Inception, The Dark Knight, Lord of the Rings--in other words: it has no \\"awe\\" moments and certainly isn't my definition of \\"epic.\\" Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is just a slow-paced, complex spy movie (and I wouldn't even call it a thriller because it doesn't thrill).<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />If you like tasteful cinematography and fantastic acting, then Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is for you. If your favorite director is Michael Bay, for instance, then you won't like this movie; and I'd almost consider that a fact.<br /><br />But, if you're patient, and don't drag your girlfriend/boyfriend to watch the movie with you (because they may complain, unless they're very likeminded), then you may really respect this film. Although, to say that you'll \\"enjoy\\" the movie would be going against my better judgement. This movie simply isn't everyone's cup of tea. That's why the film itself wasn't up for a nomination. It's really slow. Good, but slow. Kind of like a weak tea before bed.ry Oldman was going to be nominated.

B0000001PW|5.0|By the time the mid 80's came along,it seemed Chick Corea's music career was at something of a stand still. Any chances of revisiting Return To Forever in any way was not a possibility. And so far the 80's had found Corea either absent from music and releasing only the occasional acoustic set here and again. In 1986 he re-emerged seemingly out of nowhere with the Elektric Band. This group consisted of Corea,bassist John Patitucci,drummer David Weckl and guitarists Scott Henderson and Carlos Rios. At this point in time,daring and explosive fusion music was giving way to something more poppier and melodic. It would one day be known as smooth jazz. And in many ways GRP was a major center in the development of that particular music. Chick Corea had something else in mind. In a similar manner to Herbie Hancock,he'd really become interested in the electric jazz medium even if he first encountered the music as reluctantly as Keith Jarrett had. But if he didn't have anything to say he would play some type of acoustic jazz just to keep up his playing ability. After a searching time,it finally seemed that he found what he was looking for in the way of a new electric jazz sound.<br /><br />  Even though instrumentation and production had changed,Chick's style hadn't. Even though the music sounds different,the compositional style isn't far removed from RTF in it's heyday. You hear that especially on numbers like \\"Rumble\\",\\"Side Walk\\" and \\"King Cockroach\\". There's a mixture of contemporary electronic drums and digital synthesizer programming playing challenging and very improvised fusion with strong,clever melodies and often quick tempos. On \\"Cool Weasel Boogie\\",\\"No Zone\\" and \\"All Love\\" there's a slower pace to it all,allowing the melody to really build up. It also showcases the band on some non digital instrumentation as well. On \\"Got A Match\\" there's some extra swinging jazz quality to the music as well,along with some very explorative electric keyboard soloing from Corea. My own favorite song on this particular album is \\"Elektric City\\",basically what amounts up to a combination of post disco electro funk with what essentially amounts up to a melodic samba rhythm.  There's also \\"India Town\\",with it's very Arabic style melodic exchanges and the closing \\"Silver Temple\\",which really gives John Patitucci to show his meddle as bass player.<br /><br />  Miles Davis once said that electricity would'nt ruin music but rather bad music would do that. Meaning that musicians without the necessary abilities and skill to play music well would'nt make good music no matter what they played. And he's right. The musicians on this album were so strong and inventive,they were able to take instrumentation people too easily malign as \\"cheesy\\" and bought out the very best in what digital sounds had to offer. Now it's very much in the contemporary idiom of the day in terms of the sound of the instruments for sure. And that's one of it's really special qualities. Not only that but the compositions are extremely inventive and strong: they don't need any electronic flash to make it sound better than it really is. You could likely play these songs with purely acoustic instruments and they'd still sound strong. To my ears,this album has aged extremely well for those reasons. It brings Chick Corea into the digital synthesizer/drum sequencer era without sacrificing any of the musical qualities he is most known for. But even still I'd count this as one of the best albums Chick has been creatively associated with.wn favorite song on this particular album is \\"Elektric City\\",basically what amounts up to a combination of post disco electro funk with what essentially amounts up to a melodic samba rhythm.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I got the first four books of the series on Kindle because I enjoyed the first season on HBO so much and I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The story starts out a bit slow, but I found myself reading for hours and couldn't wait to pick up the book again the next evening.<br /><br />No problems with the Kindle version at all and the George R. R. Martin's world is rich, diverse, and entertaining. I'm about 1/4 of the way through the fourth book and can't wait to finish the series to find out how it all ends! Definitely a good adult read!

0767903862|5.0|It's clear from the first few pages that Bryson has sidestepped the trite and tiresome stereotypes about Australia and Australians. As a consequence, he gets to the heart of what we and our country are really about, as much as anyone can. Bryson's description of the way we describe and relate to the variety of deadly snakes, spiders and sea life was spot on - I've never met an Aussie who doesn't enjoy listing these perils to a foreigner in glorious detail, only to immediately dismiss any danger in the next breath. Loved the part on Canberra and its soullessness as well as the irony of the Harold Holt pool and the tedium of cricket commentary. I recognise myself in all of this, rather than the \\"shrimp on the barbie\\" nonsense. And Bryson is really funny. Highly recommended.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|the game is really fun but every 5 secounds a add comes up. and it tricks you into buying things. if it say you don't have enough gem and then would you like to buy more and you feather press o.k or the x. and the x is really small in the corner. so most people press o.k and guess what you just spent 9.99 on the game. and even if you wanted to buy the gems it does not show up. I do not think this app is good for kids 10 and under and my screen is green for an hour. other than that its pretty fun.(;
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I'm not a great horror fan, and the Cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style used in some recent films of the type churns my stomach, but the description for \\"Troll Hunter\\" caught my eye and the trailer set the hook so I decided to give it a chance.  What a good decision that was!  This film is engaging and funny, skillfully skirting the \\"hokey\\" line crossed by most films of the type and actually feeling most of the time as what it purports to be, an attempt by some young filmmakers to document a real series of events.  The production values are above average, the acting quite good and the characters are interesting and reasonably developed within the context of the story.  The scenery is often breathtaking, and the special effects better than in some big-budget features.<br /><br />That \\"Trollhunter\\" was not a real success in the U.S. market can perhaps best be explained by the fact it's a foreign-language film with English subtitles.  This is sad; American audiences are missing a lot by depending almost exclusively on a few Hollywood studios for entertainment.  The rest of the world, both within and outside North America, is catching up and in many ways already far beyond the hidebound studios that used to own box offices around the world.<br /><br />Watch this film.  I think you'll enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game very addictive keeps my little sister very occupied. as well as myself never gets old unlock games everyday:-)
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|This movie was really cute. It is really focused on Steve Carell and his relationship with Julianne Moore and how their marriage kind of falls apart and makes its way back. Steve Carell definitely does the \\"cuckhold\\" husband part well with this super uncomfortably awkward moments back into the dating scene, and his genuine believability as a decent husband and even better father. Julianne Moore was outshined fairly well by the entire cast, lol, even the son. Ryan Gosling could NOT have played his part better. In fact I wish there had been more of him in the film, he was fantastic as the \\"Hot Guy Who Hit on Me at the Bar.\\" He played the player with such elegance and finesse that you were on his side the entire time. Not to mention he obviously had a sweet side to take Steve Carell's character under his wing and show him the playboy ropes, if you will, even if just for a short time. The movie was funny, sappy, heartwarming, the whole 9 yards. Don't expect unending laughter because it is more like \\"Dan in Real Life\\" or \\"The Story of Us\\" that just incorporate more of a realistic tone into the scope of things. Overall this movie was really cute and worth a watch, even if it is just for the shirtless scene with Ryan Gosling (oh so worth the time :)!)

However if the parents are going to supervise them and assist with turning the pages it should last a while.  Easy to record and easy to change if you want to re-record over if desired.  I would rate higher if it was a little more durable but you get exactly what is described in the description.

B0002KPIQY|3.0|\\"Gia\\" is a 1998 film about the rise and fall of a super model.  So why would any man want to see this movie?  Angelina Jolie.  The film is tedious, runs over 2 hours, and most of the world by now knows what drug addiction ends up doing to those unable to rehabilitate.  The film delves into same gender orientation lifestyles, but not as erotically as you might expect.  The photo session for the model \\"GIa\\" that Angelina Jolie portrayed that made this DVD worth buying, involves a chain link fence (most of which made me wonder about a stunt double).  Pretty much the rest of the movie merits the fast forward button.  Not a cable TV view, unless you have premium channels (i.e. HBO).  This unrated version here on Amazon has more flesh-fest and girl-girl interest than the R-rated version.  You might want to look it up on the Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB) for more info.  Faye Dunaway also stars, filmed in Los Angeles and New York.

0156030470|5.0|The Power of \\"To\\"<br /><br />  Furiously trying to finish reading To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf before the opera began, I didn't take time to read the program notes. The lights dimmed, three men stood on stage, a table behind them. Several days earlier, I attended a discussion by a set designer named Beowulf Boritt, who explained his \\"lighthouse\\" came together in three acts, the \\"lighthouse\\" being built on the stage. Woolf's text was divided into three parts. Made sense to me. The men began singing, the small orchestra played. I waited for Mrs. Ramsay and Lily Briscoe to appear . . . and finally figured out--the opera was not based Virginia Woolf's novel. I leaped from Peter Maxwell Davies' The Lighthouse to Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. This lighthouse was about the murder of three lighthouse keepers.<br /><br />Virginia Woolf, the early feminist who wrote A Room of Her Own, ask for women to have a seat at the publishing table. She ended up in a sexless marriage to a man whom she loved, yet her husband, realizing his wife's creative genius, published her work: To the Lighthouse, Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, Flush, and A Room of One's Own. Unable to live through a second world war, Virginia committed suicide, putting rocks in her pockets and \\"finding a room of her own.\\" She created a path for women writers to follow her powerful creative pen.<br /><br />Reading Lighthouse again, I was struck by how much my writing reflects Woolf's. Her three sections, the first with Mrs. Dalloway's knitting sock, her son James' cutting objects from a catalogue, Lily Brisco's painting a picture; flash forward to Mrs. Dalloway's death; and finally the present with James, his sister Cam, and their father rowing to the Lighthouse as Lily Brisco paints a scene begun years prior. My novel takes the protagonist to a flashback in college, to an incident after the husband's death; to the husband's death, a flashback to her living alone, forward to her entering a war zone. Editors continue to respond, The text is confusing to readers. Not so, say most readers.<br /><br />Other similarities include Woolf's interior monologues of Lily Brisco as she observes Mrs. Dalloway; text repetition, \\"some one had blundered\\" written five times; \\"We are in the hands of the Lord\\" written twice); \\"But I beneath a rougher sea/ Was whelmed in deep gulfs than he.\\" Written twice. My text is filled with blood, sex, money, CIA references repetitiously strewn throughout the novel. Her text separated and set off for emphasis<br />  \\"stormed at with shot and shell.\\"<br />  My \\"Straight Arrow\\" chapter sets off inner dialogue<br />  \\"MY HEART<br />  ARRHYTHMIC<br />  ASPIRATING<br />  LIKE THE BLOOD IS LEAKING<br />  LEAKING INTO MY MOUTH<br />  THE FAÇADE<br />  BRITTLE<br />  A SCREAM SILENT\\"<br />to demonstrate my horror at hearing a best friend had assassinated an entire family and their servants and nervously waited for a helicopter to retrieve him.<br /><br />Even Woolf's \\"subject/object\\" and the nature of reality, that is--\\"you think of a kitchen table when a kitchen table is not present in your vision\\" is similar.  My epilogue in six sections, hermeneutics & T.S. Eliot's objective correlative--objects arranged to affect an epiphany--and students learning to read high-level conceptual thinking, through objects--a mother's breast to a kitchen table to love and empathy, models Woolf's \\"subject/object.\\" Woolf's colors--red, purple, grey, blue, lemon, white, violet--are written into my stories, red poinsettias, gold temples, grey uniforms, white smoke from a Buddhist cremation. Woolf's themes--\\"knitting, the journey is enough\\"; my spiraling journey begins and ends at the same point, the journey is the focus. Woolf's ideas: \\"half of one's notions of other people, after all, were grotesque. They served private notions of one's own.\\" We say (or write) the words we need to hear.<br /><br />And I guess we \\"write\\" what we need to read. Virginia filled her pockets with rocks and stepped into the stream that changed writing for women. We're all taking a journey \\"to\\" the lighthouse.\\"

0307352145|5.0|Very few of us, at least in the western culture, aspire to be \\"more introverted\\", but the same can't be said of being \\"more extraverted\\". Introversion is not a pathology or a defect, and yet, for some reason, it is often perceived as a weakness. Except, nothing could be further from the truth. As the author points out, this extravert bias is (a) fairly recent in the western culture, and (b) is actually reversed in many Asian cultures. Further, shyness and introversion have nothing to do with each other: an introvert can be a great public speaker and leader. In fact, many are. Introversion vs. Extraversion is not black and white but a continuum. We move up and down this scale based on our jobs, circumstance or even time of day - the difference is that all of us have different equilibrium points.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" is a great conversation starter on the subject; we need more books like this. In a few places the book does seem to stretch the research and metaphors, but the opening 1/3 of the book, which discusses the cultural bias(es) associated with introversion is itself worth the price of the book.

I read one of the 1-star reviews and was concerned so I watched it myself. What a great kid's movie with lots of hilarious adult puns and great muppet nostalgia. If you are in the mood for a very G movie and are familiar with the muppets from your childhood, this movie is great.

So I bought the Kindle version for 5 bucks thinking maybe I will like and my daughters and I can see movie together. But I was very pleasantly surprised. I read it in 2 days - could not put it down. Sure its a little juvenile and not terribly thought-provoking but SO WHAT! The story in entertaining, the characters flawed but fascinating and its even a little funny. Please buy, read, and enjoy! Repeat with Catching Fire and Mockingjay as well. I'm almost done with Mockingjay and dreading the moment I finish - what will I read next?!

0439023491|5.0|This is the first sequel in a very long time that I immediately picked up after finishing the previous installment. Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games completely took me by surprise with its brilliantly fast paced narrative, heart-wrenching plot and incredible protagonist that didn't follow the typical teen novel cliches. Catching Fire is a great sequel that doesn't fall into the usual second entry pitfall that many authors stumble into.<br /><br />With her desperate final attempt for salvation at the end of the Hunger Games, Katniss has become much more than the simple tribute from District 12. Her courageous showing of defiance has made her the seed of hope for the oppressed populace of Panem. One that if left unchecked could unravel the Capitol's curtain of fear from the frightened masses and replace it with rebellion. She's become the spark that could ignite a revolution, an appropriate metaphor that correlates with her title: the girl on fire. With the threat to their social order, the Capitol has made Katniss into a political target. Not believing her actions were derived from a desperate act of love but rather a instigation for rebellion, they issue her an ultimatum: convince the Capitol her relationship with Peeta is legitimate and not a folly, or else.<br /><br />If the Hunger Games characterized the nightmare of absolute totalitarian control, than Catching Fire represents Katniss's will to defy such a regime. Defiance by loving whomever she desires through her own will, the right to not live as an image the Capitol deems appropriate, and ultimately keeping her loved ones safe from their wrath. The will to stand defiant is the dilemma that has consumed her thoughts and dominates the book's tone. Should she lead an uprising against a government regime that deserves to be overthrown, but at the dire cost of making everyone she loves targets? But is life truly worth living if it means an existence of absolute docility to evil? It's a very thought-provoking question that Collins illustrates very well.<br /><br />Catching Fire's narrative doesn't share the same break-neck pace that The Hunger Games possessed. It's by no means a slow book, but this allows the narrative to catch its breath and elaborate more on the dystopian future of Panem, such as delving even further into Panem's ignorant upper class which helps reinforce the theme of poverty vs wealth from the last entry. But more importantly, it gives the characters that had merely a brief introduction in the last installment some much needed attention. Collins really surprised me in the last book with the relationship between Katniss and Peeta. It completely forwent the traditional contrived romances that I find teen novels are infamous for. Yet when Gale entered the story as a more predominant figure, I expected the worst. Fortunately Collins still managed to keep the relationships between these characters from feeling like a clich&eacute; Hollywood soap opera. Simply put, does she go with Gale, the boy who understands her views and feelings on life better than anyone? Or does she choose Peeta? One who has already publicly confessed his feelings towards her, and who has been to hell and back with her during the Hunger Games. Yet choosing Peeta would also mean becoming the very image the Capitol requires her to be, a harmless and controllable one that would inspire no further thoughts of rebellion.<br /><br />Without spoiling the plot, let's just say that Katniss once again finds herself in a dangerous predicament later in the story. While it was entertaining, I didn't feel the same sense of absolute desperation and paranoia that made the first book's second half so engaging. The reasoning for this is that unlike last time Katniss isn't alone in her struggle. It follows the \\"keep your enemies close and your friends closer\\" mentality of deception. This changes the feel just enough to not feel like a complete retread of the last book, but it didn't have nearly the same amount of tension that had me glued to the pages like before.<br /><br />While it may not have the same amount of emotional investment that The Hunger Games had for me, Catching Fire still manages to create a very grim dystopian future that the reader wants to see overthrown due to their emotional connection they share with the protagonist. It's a very entertaining, thought-provoking, science fiction novel with a lot of heart that feels like the natural evolution from its predecessor.mount of tension that had me glued to the pages like before.<br /><br />While it may not have the same amount of emotional investment that The Hunger Games had for me, Catching Fire still manages to create a very grim dystopian future that the reader wants to see overthrown due to their emotional connection they share with the protagonist.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|At first, I thought it was a remake of the first remake of the movie by John Carpenter. Only in the end of the movie can you understand that it is not. It's an actual prequel to the Thing.<br />The morphing of the creatures is not the same as in the remake of the original movie.  I am not jumpy on fantasy/horror movies and I do not like gore. However this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />Pros: Amazing graphics (not looking cartoonish or too computerized). Good set of actors (However I didn't love them, they acted good). First, iw as thinking there would be two main heroes through the whole movie. I was wrong. And I was thinking there would be a romance between the main heroes. I was wrong again. It would be unnecessary and there are plenty of other things to show in the movie. Glad that didn't happen. Director seemed to make a good job overall. With minor ''I wish it was different or I wish it was that way''. More and more people will get a chance to see John Carpenter's classic. Since it is one of the best movies I ever saw, I am very happy.<br />Cons: For 100.000 years an alien didn't seem to be buried deep enough under ice like it's spacecraft. In one scene a guy gets a stick. Question is why didn't they show how he got it. Not too much of a big deal, but they didn't show it. Guess they were really busy or inspired witht the movie. I forgive that. Next is the storm. We didn't see it. It was a good weather all the time. The next thing is everything that goes after going into the speceship. Wish the alien didn't have the face on the front but somewhere on the rib side. That way the humans face wouldn't be the center of everything. It's an alien we should be looking at not the dead human. If we wanted to know who it was we could look on any other side of aliens body. And it was already obvious who turned out to be an alien. The next thing is the grenade part and miraculous. Please, that's too Holliwood. The main actress couldn't have escaped easilyand grabbed the grenade and kill an alien. I will not spoil how she saved herself. Watch the movie.<br />Overall it is enjoyable, very well made movie. I have to give it 5 stars. It's a great prequel and now I really want to see a movie that goes on what happened after John Carpenter's remake. And of course not just some alien movie, but what will inspire us further.<br />It's a movie that should be owned on dvd or blueray! I've been waiting a year for it, since I first heard of it. A year of waiting truly payed of!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It wasn't that I didn't want to read the book when it first came out, I just hadn't yet had the time to sit down and read it, but I'm glad I did.  The first book of this trilogy is fantastic, fast paced, action packed, and with a first person narration that actually does what it should -- let you into the mind of a character.<br /><br />The first person narration does take some getting used to, not because it's bad or poorly done, just because it's different.  If you're an avid reader you'll pick up on it immediately and it takes some time to adjust, but it's well worth it.  Katniss has quickly become one of my favorite book heroines and she truly earns that title.  Thrown into an arena with 24 other tributes she is forced to fight for her life.  I won't give anything away, but she's the perfect example of a strong female character.  The world Collins creates in the Hunger Games is very unique, filled with the usual dystopian characteristics, Collins also manages to put her own unique spin on things which keeps it from feeling like more of the same.  It is YA, so don't expect \\"literature\\" here, the language is simplistic and the book is a very quick read but that's no reason to pass it up.<br /><br />The Hunger Games creates an unbelievable and horrific society, then places you right in the middle of it.  This book lives up to the hype, if you haven't read it yet, what are you waiting for!
B007JUWM64|1.0|This is possibly the worst version of this epic tale I have ever experienced, flying ships, REALLY. Not to mention poor acting, this movie trashed the idea of the Musketeers.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|A new twist to figure out, that was good. However, as soon as you understand it, it's easy to go thru the levels.  There are only about a third as many levels of previous versions so I was able to go thru each with two star minimum within one day.  I enjoyed what was there but am disappointed by quantity.  There is room for future additions Coming Soon. They should've waited to release until they had more content on it

0312576463|5.0|Realist fiction at its best. Franzen gave us the hard, unboiled truth of the intricate, often sad psychological subtleties and the general political subtext that both comprise our contemporary lives. Sometimes the picture is hard to look at, but all the more valuable and rewarding in the end. People who complain about being bored, should just try to turn their attention to Grisham.

B00400NHRO|5.0|If you ask any doctor what book he or she should read, then \\"House of God\\" is it.  This is the classic tale from the '70s which follows residents as they learn, treat, and interact with patients.  Terms such as \\"gomer\\" (short for Get Out of My Emergency Room) were first revealed to readers in this book.  Dr. Samuel Shem (a pen name) did a great job depicting the hospital as a sexual madhouse, way before Gray's Anatomy came along.  As a physician myself, I recommend this book to all my medical students and premeds.<br />\\"The House of God\\" was published back in the 70's, so the one knock on it is that it is now out-of-date.<br />CNN's house doctor Dr. Sanjay Gupta's [[ASIN:0446583855 Monday Mornings: A Novel]] is a good read for pre-meds and med students interested in the medical field.  Although this one doesn't cover medical school per se, it's a great read about practicing physicians.  Like H.O.G., it's fiction.<br />For nonfiction fans, I highly recommend [[ASIN:1594488436 God's Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicine]]. It's a well-written and even somewhat poetic recounting of one of the last old-fashioned hospitals in the U.S.

B0043D2DUU|5.0|Sure, it doesn't cover the standard library much. I also don't suggest trying to use it as an introduction to programming in C++, unless you're experienced in C or another object-oriented language such as Java. However, this really covers the essence of C++, despite being a bit technical and confusing for beginners. I suggest you use a separate resource for coverage of the standard library, but this is cheap and effective. Q.E.D. (Yep, I felt like sneaking in a mathematical proof that this is good.)
0425241505|5.0|This book lived up to EVERY expectation. When I purchased there was not a review that was below three stars...come on, not everyone loves a book that much. But it's all true :)  This story has a strong alpha male that is strong to the end, something that some authors seem not to do. You get drawn in immediately, exactly like Dragos does, and you can't put this book down. The action and romance and depth of feeling and character development is added layer upon layer with finesse and a complexity that is nice to see. ( Again, glad Thea Harrison knows we all aren't tweens and can handle some things left unsaid).<br /><br />Thea, if you read this, please please write more books with Dragos and Pia in it as the main characters, you have made them so interesting you could write an entire series on just these two!!!

B00701QVVY|5.0|Overkill's ability to write one good album after another is nothing short of unbelievable, but their discography is all the proof anyone would need that they can do it.  Add in their unmatched work ethic, and you have a band that deserves at least ten times as much recognition as it gets.  Every time I've seen these guys live, they've not only destroyed  onstage, but they've also stuck around after the show to meet their fans, sign autographs, take pics, and just talk music.  The last time I saw them, their drummer, Ron Lipnicki, even brought my friends and me some beers from their bus because my buddy's car got towed.  That kind of dedication over the years has earned Overkill a die-hard fanbase that would probably support their new albums even if they weren't great, but Blitz and D.D. make sure that's not a concern.<br /><br />The Electric Age picks up where Ironbound, my favorite album of 2010, left off.  The longtime songwriting tandem of Ellsworth and Verni has found a perfect groove with Dave Linsk and Derek Tailer, driven by the powerhouse thrash drumming of Lipnicki.  Every song is a highlight with tons of shredding and plenty of speed, but some that stand out to me are Come and Get It, Electric Rattlesnake, Black Daze, Save Yourself, Drop the Hammer Down, Old Wounds New Scars, and Good Night.  Some sound like a combination of Horrorscope and Ironbound, others like Taking Over and Ironbound, and a couple like Under the Influence.  The attitude of Old Wounds New Scars would fit right in on Under the Influence, with the lyric \\"Gotta lotta mouth for a Jersey white boy,\\" and Drop the Hammer Down has an AWESOME rolling riff, fast sections, and a little NWOBHM melody; it's all just damn good music.  Do yourself a favor and support the metal institution that is Overkill, because a band with sixteen 4-to-5 star albums over nearly 30 years deserves no less.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you don't know why you have to watch this, then I gotta wonder what verse you were born in.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|This 2-CD set captures a monumental performance from probably the best live heavy metal band of all time.  Look at their enormous tours, legendary concerts, and rabid following, and you can't really argue against it.  In this show from Chile, Bruce Dickinson proves for the millionth time that he has preserved his voice better than anyone else in hard rock or metal.  The man is in his 50's and doesn't sound a day over 25 or 30.  Having a gigantic force like that fronting an older band is almost unheard of, as many of Dickinson's peers' voices have succumbed to age, hard living, or both.  The rest of the band are no slouches either, delivering a powerful set with conviction and enthusiasm.  Speaking of the set, En Vivo has a good mix of different eras.  You get 17 songs, with five from the early 80's (from Iron Maiden, The Number of the Beast, and Piece of Mind), one each from Powerslave and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son from 1984 and 1988 respectively, one song from the 90's (the title track to Fear of the Dark), three songs from the early 2000's, and six from The Final Frontier, the album behind the tour.  Overall, they don't rely on their \\"greatest hits\\" in this show, playing many modern Maiden tunes, but they still deliver mandatory numbers like The Number of the Beast and The Trooper.  The crowd in Chile completes the package for En Vivo, providing a massive wall of backing vocals, cheers, and chants.  If you're a fan of Iron Maiden, pick this up for a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun game but the need to loosen up on the &quot;invest&quot; rewards ... becomes boring quickly while you wait. I don't like being asked or badgered about submitting to FaceBook ... once is fine, twice your pushing it, consistently and you loose 2 stars for it.
B003ITDN86|5.0|Ive been a big Sum 41 fan every since 2000. I am the only person that I know that likes them more than Blink 182.  I was so highly anticipating this album the i bought it the day it came out. And Ive had it for about a year now so I think it was about time I wrote a review.<br /><br />Overall I love the album, but there are a couple songs I dont really care for.<br /><br />The two \\"Bad\\" songs are 'Babe you don't wanna know' and 'Time for you to go'<br />I completly hate 'Babe you dont wanna know' it reminds me of green day and I hate that band.<br /><br />But the two songs that I think are instant hits are \\"Blood in my eyes\\" and \\"Back where I belong\\". Those 2 songs just remind me of the old sum 41 that I always loved and still miss.<br /><br />Overall I would give the album a Solid 4/5.

B004UXUUDA|4.0|I haven't read the book Sarah's Key, which I thought was worth noting before I started my review. I wasn't expecting Sarah's Key to be as intense as it was since the synopsis didn't include anything about the Holocaust. While the movie's serious subject matter will be offsetting to some, it really was an enjoyable film.<br /><br />Kristen Scott Thomas makes the film. I hadn't heard of this film at all before it arrived at my house so I was worried that it might just be one of those movies that really isn't all that different from a Lifetime original movie. But Kristen Scott Thomas gives a believable performance that comes across as genuine rather than melodramatic. I was actually sad to see her role diminish as the movie progressed.<br /><br />I have the film four stars rather than five because I thought that the flashback scenes could've been integrated into the movie in a more professional fashion than they were. I understand that the movie was trying to follow the book, but it felt weird that the movie spent so much time at once on the flashback moments. Kristen Scott Thomas is supposed to be the lead and her relationship with the reader is challenged once she basically disappears as the flashbacks begin.<br /><br />I enjoyed Sarah's Key, but I don't know if it has a lot of mainstream appeal. Those with personal connections to the story will be pleased with it, but I don't know if the typical American would. There are plenty of good movies out there, I don't know if Sarah's Key stands out enough to captivate the interest of people who either haven't read the book or don't have emotional ties.
0784011710|5.0|I absolutely adore Meryl Streep. Her role as Sophie was captivating and very much entertaining. This film is filled with surprises, love, innocence, hate, betrayal, lust, forgiveness, doubt and uncertainty. All of which are the ingredients to make a great film. This may just be my favorite film starring Meryl Streep. I have so much admiration for Sophie and her choices, and Meryl did an amazing job in bringing this character to life evoking emotion from me as a viewer. Job well done!
B002UBRFDC|4.0|This must have been a labor of love, because its page count is right up there with Atlas Shrugged. Unlike the Rand classic, however, this book isn't ideologically padded with a terribly redundant point of view. The author had a lot of story and a strong penchant for vivid imagery. Wrap this up with a strong personal perspective on late 16th and early 17th century cultures of both Japan and Western Europe and you have a book that rivals A Tale of Two Cities. It is a very important book that should survive in some sort of print for generations. Still, at 1152 pages it is simply too long. Otherwise I would gladly have given it five stars, or even six!<br /><br />Historically, it is a romanticized retelling of the rise to power of Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate that survived from 1600 through 1868. But the magic of the novel is the story of an English pilot of a dutch fleet named Blackthorne. As the book opens we are with him in the western Pacific. He and the rest of the survivors have a case of scurvy--his not as serious because of the way he carefully husbanded his fruit. At this point there is only one ship left of the original five and it finds itself in a storm that carries it towards a reef surrounding the Japans. Miraculously, the pilot slips the ship through a small break in the reef and it careens on to safe harbor. Blackthorne loses consciousness and awakes on the floor of what turns out to be a Japanese house.<br /><br />Here the author takes a huge risk and defines Japanese \\"civilization\\" by the casual beheading of a bad-mannered peasant in Blacktorne's presence. The scene is artfully portrayed, and is the beginning of a series of horrors that slowly come to make more sense within the context of the novel. Clavell's handling of the more bizarre elements of both cultures vividly juxtaposes them, showing the blood-thirsty Japanese culture to easily be the superior one.<br /><br />Contrasts are clearly delineated in every arena. Christianity is contrasted with Buddhism. Men are contrasted with women. Samurai are contrasted with peasants. Everyone, everything has a place and is trreated with appropriate respect.What makes this a truly memorable book is the way the author makes the foreignor Blackthorne--he is renamed \\"Anjin-san\\" because the Japanese tongue cannot handle \\"l's\\" and \\"r's\\" in conjunction with one another. While the most important Japanese character, Toranaga is an analog for the real life Tokugawa, and the villain Ishido represents the opponent Ishidi, I don't believe there is a real-life representation of Blackthorne. He is a Clavell invention.<br /><br />While huge armies are described, action is kept small, personal and intimate. There are ninjas with assassination attempts. There are encounters at sea and mass duels on land between rival groups of samurai. The only large, strategically important encounter is briefly referenced and dismissed in the last three pages of the book. Here Clavell hewes to history and correctly calls it the Battle of Sekigahara. After that Toranaga is pre-eminent and becomes Shogun, as is his karma.<br /><br />After you've read a couple thousand novels, it becomes more difficult for one to completely capture you and carry you through its narrative without attention to the time you are spending with it or in fact with anything to do with the outside world. The novel can briefly become your life, transporting you to its setting; making you a citizen of its world. Shogun is such a novel.
B007ORVC36|2.0|I'm a prime member, and I bought the season premiere. I didn't realize that the video quality would be fuzzy and that the second part of the episode (shown on the same night) would be an additional price. On one screen, the second episode was listed as free, but when I downloaded the first part, suddenly the second part was an additional fee.<br /><br />If Amazon charges for video streaming, it should at least deliver a clear picture. My connection time was excellent, with all the bars, but the video stopped a few times to \\"connect\\" and I had to reload the page once.  Apparently this is a problem with Amazon.<br /><br />Best consider another source or pay the HD premium price to watch. It's a bit ridiculous to pay $6 to watch one evening's episode of Mad Mad, though.

0385738773|3.0|I don't know. Maybe Dashner thought he was ratcheting up the suspense in this final installment. But I had the experience I see among so many others - it was a story that went around and around and accomplished very little. I'm indebted to Christopher for pointing out the story that could have been riveting that Dashner completely walked away from - the confrontation of the designers with those who had to live in the maze. The ultimate expression of that confrontation would have been Thomas' conflict within himself. But Dashner sidesteps this plot line and even the next most interesting confrontation - the meeting between those who remembered the time before and those who only lived in the current time.<br /><br />Instead, we get this lukewarm, somewhat stilted, and ultimately unsatisfying conflict between Thomas and Rat Face. And even that takes pages and pages to get to. In the meantime, how many times does Thomas have to live his ambivalence with Newt's fate? There's a saying in screenplay writing - you're repeating the beat. In other words, you're not moving the story ahead in any way, you're just replaying a section of conflict you've already visited. As readers, we're forced to sit through Thomas's internal struggle with Newt no fewer than three times. It's as though Dashner has his own demons he can never exorcise.<br /><br />By avoiding the real internal struggles, the book became at once overblown and tedious at the same time.

B005DN5BE4|4.0|Amistad Movie Review<br />Adrian Law<br /><br />  Steven Spielberg mastery of film, without a doubt, shines through in the Amistad. He does immerse the audience with the characters, when he could tell the entire story just by showing the built up emotion in Cinqué's eyes. However, in a move to appeal more to American audiences, he altered the Amistad court case as a turning point in the fight against domestic slavery and not about the Atlantic Slave Trade. This film may be a masterpiece in its own right, and indeed as a drama it pulls no punches, but historically there are some holes and misconceptions.<br />  Historically, the Amistad was a court case that gained international attention because three of the world's powers, Spain, Great Britain and the United States were involved. A great deal of pressure and political maneuvering ensured surrounding the 51 Africans, with the British enforcing their treaty with Spain regarding the blocking of illegal slave trade south of the equator while the United States Supreme Court became the stage on which the US did not honor Spanish wishes and the US Constitution's supremacy clause used to support the Spanish argument for the return of the slaves. John Quincy Adams did not, as shown in the film, make an argument based on life liberty and justice, but instead pointed out that the US Government had no right to interfere with court proceedings and therefore political needs did not dictate justice. In the end, this famous court case is only significant concerning executive power over the judicial branch and the international role in the Supreme Court. The Amistad had little to do with ticking off the Southern senators or Van Buren's efforts in gaining favor with the slave-owners. The American Civil war wasn't even on the horizon till two decades later. Even though it was hailed as a victory by the abolitionists and the Africans were indeed returned to Africa in defiance of Spanish wishes, the Amistad was a dispute about international treaties and not about human rights.<br />  That said, however, the film does more justice in portraying the cruelty of the slave trade and its institution by illegal traders and slave fortresses. One unforgettable scene is when the crew of the slave ship Tecora, realizing that some of the slaves may not survive the trip, tie a dozen weak and sick Africans by their ankles to an anchor, and the camera pans down as one by one they sink to the bottom, struggling to free themselves. The actors, especially Djimon Hounsou as Cinqué, can move the audience just by the emotion in their voice and the tears welling up in their eyes as they recount traumatic experiences. If you decide to watch this film, keep in mind that the story is unfaithful to history, but as a story about the question of slavery and all the complications that tied down America pre-Civil War, then it is one of the best films out there, made to be enjoyed.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung (especially Jamie Chung) are all very hot superbabes.  Watching them defy gravity while kicking some serious CGI arse--while scantily clad, mind you--does wonders for one's libido.  However, the onslaught of eye candy that is the essence of SUCKER PUNCH brings beauty but no substance; this sweet tooth fantasy causes cavities.  Sure, it's a graphic novel brought to the silver screen, but it still fails to deliver any modicum of stability or sensibility.  This belly wobbler is nonstop nonsense that wreaks havoc on suspension of disbelief; it's hard to enjoy all the aesthetic goodies while constantly rolling one's eyes.<br /><br />Told from the point of view of Babydoll (a platinum blonde Browning), we are privy to the mental unraveling of a persecuted babe about to undergo a lobotomy in a mental asylum.  And the asylum suddenly becomes some sort of surreal brothel, and while Babydoll enchants onlookers while dancing (and we never see the dances) she imagines herself and her fellow femme fatales battling dragons and robotic Samurai and zombies and every nutty thing in between; so the story is an illusion of an illusion of an illusion.  As additions to the super hawt babe cast we find a misused Scott Glenn and underwhelming Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino (sporting a Russian accent, for cryin' out loud).  The visuals and CGI effects are impressive, yet cannot overcome a lame pizza story with a goofball ending; SUCKER PUNCH at least gets two stars for suckering me to watch the entire fiasco--eye candy and all.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|The video would have been fine I think, if we could have heard it, but we  were unable to get closed captioning to function.  This is a big problem for me and for my husband.

If I had known that closed captioning would be considered a special feature I would not have purchased the DVD.

I can so imagine dancing to many of the tracks in a club especially with I'm addicted and Gang Bang is one of her best songs in a decade. There are the beautiful ballads as well such as Falling Free, Masterpiece and I Effed Up where you can hear her beautiful voice without the electro sounds that takes you back to her Something to Remember days. Overall a great solid album.

B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA is eclectic and proves, once again, that Madonna still reigns supreme even after 30 years in the business.  I can't say enough good things regarding the sound, the production, the beats, and the fun this album offers. It's easily one of her most preeminent albums of work. It offers everything. I have been a fan since I was 7 and thankfully I don't want Madonna to re-release 'Papa Don't Preach' or 'Ray of Light' over and over again. My tastes have not remained in 1986 or 1998 over the years and, thankfully, Madonna continues to expand on her unique musical perceptions.  She never disappoints me but MDNA is so boldly modern and \\"now\\" that I can't thank her enough.  It's quite possibly TOO ahead of the game for some...typical of Madonna. This album has been on constant repeat for a full month now.

Every woman should read at least one and find herself immersed in Diana Gabaldon's incredible ability to literally picture life as it quite possibly was but also to enable the reader to picture it with her. As a 73-year old reader having seen something of life I read Diana's books and think we all ought to have known our own Jamie.

1439192812|5.0|My advice is to forget any controversy about Dawkins' attitude towards religious believers (your kid doesn't care) and buy this book for your young scientist! What a treasure Dawkins has created here together with illustrator Dave McKean: an accessible, brilliantly explained introduction to the deepest secrets of human existence. I read this to my precocious six-year old over three months, and can't count the number of times her eyes grew wide with excitement at new discoveries about our place in the universe. Among many highlights are the \\"photograph\\" of our 185-million greats grandfather (hint:gills) on page 40, and the step-by-step introduction to optics culminating in how a rainbow is formed. (I am 35 and never fully understood how light interacts with falling water droplets to create the rainbow. I do now.) Without dumbing down any explanations, Dawkins nevertheless makes complicated subjects understandable and relate-able to young readers.<br /><br />This is a book to be shared between parent and child, and then re-devoured over a lifetime by the child as they grow older and savvier. More than simply a book of science topics, this is a love letter to our world as we actually understand it, and the many people who worked to bring us the knowledge of what is real and true.

B003I5MGGA|5.0|Love radiates in full splendor for at least one eternity in Franco Zeffirelli's cinematic `high romance' adaptation of Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\"; first showcased in 1968 and has since grown in stature as an artistic classic of the first order. Superior performances by Olivia Hussey (eternally young and optimistic Juliet), Leonard Whiting (impassioned and headstrong Romeo), Milo O'Shea (the ill-advised Friar Laurence), Michael York (hot-tempered, resentful Tybalt, aka `the Prince of Cats'), and John McEnery (moody, melancholic, sharp-tongued, and self-effacing Mercutio) and a superb cast and film crew (your work is remarkable in this film; wherever you are: Thank you!) - made all the difference in this remake. Previous attempts had faltered because the actor and actress - selected to play our teenage couple - were in fact \\"a wee bit too old and not quite believable' for the parts but too famous `to deny the roles to'; such is the cinema history leading up to this production, a box office and commercial hit in its day. So brilliant was this adaption - that it has remained a definitive, high octane rendition of an age-old tale of youthful love, passion, intimacy, misjudgement, unleashed anger resulting in death, poetic justice, and a roller-coaster ride of dramatic irony and intent - that to this day - reminds us that 15 year olds can stir up considerable unsubtle dramatic tragedy on any given day. It almost takes your breath away!<br /><br />We yearn for another drop of passion from this cinematic play about tragic love gone asunder. Each viewing - like a glass of dry, delicious Italian wine - drops onto the tongue and perhaps encourages - yet another viewing of this ageless classic. And those long kisses...how could they reveal so much? All unities adhered to. So many dramatic ironies one needs a magnifying glass to reveal which layer of irony superimposed upon another one.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|What an incredibly vapid and boring protagonist and don't get me started on the love interest.UGH how this book has 4.5 stars is beyond me.<br />1. Obsessive codependency<br />2. The vileness of constantly referring to the other girls as whores like the love interest is any better.<br />3. Attacking people for looking at somebody...not attractive in the least.<br />4. How do you sleep in another mans bed and think it's okay to justify it with we're just friends?<br />The only thing I like about this book is the best friend America and even that is pushing it.<br />I can go on and on with the million things wrong with this book.<br />Don't waste your time!

B002C949KE|4.0|While I feel that over reliance on studies done on university students in a controlled setting leads to certain problems, there is some fascinating research discussed in this book. In particular, I feel that Ariely's distinction between social norms and market norms is done in a clear and engaging manner. When some thought is applied to this section of the book it quickly becomes applicable to a plethora of situations.<br /><br />This distinction can explain matters as wide ranging as why rifts often form between members of family businesses and why certain charities fail to motivate their volunteers and/or ameliorate pressing social challenges.

B00506NRBS|4.0|A quick, fascinating read from an \\"accidental entrepreneur\\" who built up an eight figure business without intending to. By being different and delighting customers Sivers built a unique corporate culture that led to a devoted following of customers and great word of mouth.<br /><br />This book paradoxically serves as a great example of the importance of hiring good people and letting them run with things, while at the same time acting as a warning to those entrepreneurs who fail to install internal controls in their business and provide at least a basic level of regular oversight to all facets of their business. Without a red flag mechanism in your business you may be left with a revolt like the one that essentially forced Sivers to sell his business.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I first saw the Fifty Shades books in the top sales on the amazon kindle book page probably a month before I actually attempted to figure out what they were about. I thought it was some self help book and moved on. It then took me another month after reading the overview and several reviews to actually purchase and begin reading these books. I have read all 3 at this moment (and I enjoyed all 3 immensely) but I'm just going to write about this first one.<br /><br />First of all, I can definitely see the comparisons between this series and Twilight. Regardless, of what others say there are parallels. However, there are just as many differences between the series as well. In a way, I kind of feel it's like comparing any other book to Twilight. You are always going to have some similarities in a romance novel. I am an avid reader of many genres. And my most common complaint for romance novels, is that everything feels rushed as opposed to young adult reads that are much better paced over 3 or 4 books. This book flowed better, more like a YA series due to the fact that the author didn't try to jam EVERYTHING into just one book. The overall plot didn't just wrap up nicely with this one book and I feel that the growth of the relationship between Ana and Christian was preserved much more nicely.<br /><br />A lot of reviews I have read, stated that it was disturbing and that the reader had to put the book down before continuing. I have to say that I didn't really find it that disturbing. I was actually a little disappointed with the lack of \\"disturbing.\\" More so, just because I was expecting a whole lot of it from reading other reviews. However, I guess if you have issues with controlling alpha men, then you might find this series disturbing and you may want to steer clear. But if your on the fence, I say go for it. This book is much more than just the erotica aspects though.<br /><br />I also felt that this book was well written, thought out and executed. There was a goodplot. I'm usually one that can figure out the plot twists in a romance novel with no problem, but I had a harder time figuring out where things were going with this one. There were no moments were I felt the book was going slow. Basically, not a lot of filler. I could not put this book down and stayed up very late into the night to finish. Overall, it was a very pleasant read and it made me want more, much more...<br /><br />I very much hope that Mrs. James gives us more books and more insight into the wonderful world of fifty!

B007D5E7C2|5.0|\\"Kill Bill\\" was either a disaster-in-the-making or a one of a kind hit -- a sprawling revenge flick that had to be cut in two and released separately. And \\"Kill Bill: 1 & 2 Double Feature\\" is a great way to see Quentin Tarantino's homage to homages -- back to back, letting you skip right from one to the next. Hallelujah.<br /><br />Tragedy strikes the Bride (Uma Thurman) on her wedding day: The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) attacks and slaughters the guests, the groom, and wounds the very pregnant Bride herself. Her former boss/lover Bill (David Carradine) finishes the bloodbath by shooting the Bride in the head. But despite his efforts, she isn't dead.<br /><br />A few years later, the Bride wakes to find that she has been in a coma for a few years, and has been being used as a sex toy for rent. After recovering enough to move, the Bride gets a sword sharp enough to \\"cut God,\\" and goes on a revenge spree against the people who wrecked her life and killed her baby, including Cottonmouth (Vivica A. Fox) and the deadly O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).<br /><br />In part two of \\"Kill Bill,\\" the Bride continues working her way up the list until she gets to Bill himself, with the intent of getting revenge. But a monkey wrench is thrown into the Bride's revenge plans when she learns the truth about her baby and whether it died, and her conflict with Bill...<br /><br />Don't expect cinematic posturing. \\"Kill Bill\\" is cinematic pop art, a loving tribute to cheesy martial-arts flicks and westerns. It's pure homage, untainted by typical directing methods and immensely entertaining if you switch off your critical faculties, refrain from asking \\"How the heck could that happen?\\"<br /><br />It also isn't for the weak of stomach; over 450 gallons of fake blood are used in both movies. But the blood usage is more \\"Monty Python\\" than \\"Braveheart\\"; it's so over-the-top that it's gloriously sick rather than disturbing. So is the violence -- hacking dozens of people down without getting so much as a scrape is impossible, but it's sure fun to watch.<br /><br />But though the first half is a stylized revengefest, it's not all gore, gouged eyes and severed limbs. The second half of the full movie is more character and dialogue-driven, in between gory killings, and explores the pasts of the DIVAS. Additionally, Tarantino throws some brilliant one-liners like \\"Those of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.\\"<br /><br />Uma Thurman, with her yellow tracksuit and katana, rules the screen as the Bride (name revealed in the second half, but she'll ALWAYS be the Bride). She cuts down people by the dozen, but it's impossible not to appreciate her. And the best supporting performances come from Liu as the ruthless O-Ren, the underrated Chiaki Kuriyama as an evil schoolgirl, and most importantly, Carradine as the quiet, ruthless Bill -- a primo performance.<br /><br />It's weird, it's creepy, it's brilliant, and somehow it's vastly entertaining. Tarantino's special triumph in \\"Kill Bill: 1 & 2 Double Feature\\" is to somehow rope his vast store of movie homages into a gory, action-packed storyline, and one that is one big bloody thrill.ing so much as a scrape is impossible, but it's sure fun to watch.<br /><br />But though the first half is a stylized revengefest, it's not all gore, gouged eyes and severed limbs.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I love gothic horror -- big cobwebbed houses, squawking ravens, rolling mists and mysterious sinister figures that are only glimpsed. \\"The Woman in Black\\" has all of those. In fact, this slow, haunting movie loads on the Edwardian ghost-story atmosphere so thick that it practically chokes you -- and while it tends to move slowly, it's beautifully creepy.<br /><br />Young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) has a life in tatters -- his career is in jeopardy, and he's still in mourning over the loss of his wife four years ago. He's sent to sort through the personal effects of Alice Drablow, who left behind a decayed mansion set in the misty marshes -- and when visiting the house, he sees a veiled woman in black.<br /><br />The locals are also desperate to get rid of him, even blaming him for the death of a child who drank lye. And soon Kipps begins to understand why, as he unravels the secrets of the Drablow family, and the madwoman who lost her child long ago. With the help of his new friend Sam Daily (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds),  Kipps will set out to stop the Woman in Black before she claims what's dearest to him.<br /><br />I haven't been too impressed with the output of the revitalized Hammer Films company. \\"The Woman in Black\\" is probably the best horror movie they've produced -- it feels like a modern version of their shadowy, gothic old movies. It's also not very scary, although director James Watkins tosses in a few jump scares (a raven, a faucet, etc).<br /><br />Instead, the movie just makes you uneasy. We're constantly aware that SOMETHING is hovering over this town. But for most of the movie, we only see fleeting glimpses of the Woman and her power.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the movie moves rather slowly, especially in the first half. But for me, it's compensated for by Watkins inserting some truly unnerving scenes, like a hysterical Mrs. Daily carving into the table. And the gothic atmosphere is so heavy and dark that it practically drips from the screen -- vast mildewed houses, foggy marshes, half-forgotten letters and old photos, and a grey rainy light that seems to wash the colors from the world.<br /><br />There's not a trace of Harry Potter in Daniel Radcliffe's performance here. His Arthur Kipps is a haunted, broken figure who seems strangely detached from the world around him, except when it comes to endangered children. The only problem is that Radcliffe looks a little young for the role -- whenever Arthur is with his little son, he looks more like the kid's big brother.<br /><br />\\"The Woman in Black\\" is rather slow at times, but the gothic atmosphere and a strong performance from Radcliffe almost make up for that. Well, I'll gladly take it over rotten slasher remakes.reen -- vast mildewed houses, foggy marshes, half-forgotten letters and old photos, and a grey rainy light that seems to wash the colors from the world.<br /><br />There's not a trace of Harry Potter in Daniel Radcliffe's performance here.

B003EYVXV4|4.0|First Impressions:  Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is now a major motion picture and though the film is quite well done, it pales to the richness of the first Collins' novel of the same name.<br /><br />The Hype:  Word of mouth has gotten around that Collins' novel is so similar to the Japanese novel \\"Battle Royale\\" that some have said it is a copy.  BR is also way more bloody and has a different angle to the whole \\"government suppression and make kids fight our wars\\" angle.  Regardless, the fight scenes appeal to the male viewers and the romance appeals to the women viewers, while the differences and similarities between the book and film remain in the cynical overview of the discerning reader!<br /><br />What's It About?:  I have read the book and have watched the film and yet don't want to bore the dear reader with the differences or similarities.  You can Google that!  No, I want to communicate what impressed me and some scenes I wish were lifted from the book to the screen that I would think would have enhanced my entertainment experience.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a tough gal who flaunts the rules of her District by sneaking through a hole in an electric fence (which is not electrified, a fact mentioned and explained in the book but not the film) to meet her pal Gale and start shooting wild animals of the forest in exchange for food and supplies in their village.  This is forbidden by the government as the government wants to keep all Districts in line and run them hard and ragged.  Several police march around looking somewhat like CHP knockoffs, LOL.<br /><br />Katniss resents her mother for zoning out and not taking care of her and her sister.  This is shown through flashbacks in some parts of the film.  You can easily miss the closeness of the village communities if you did not read the book nor were familiar with Kat's mother and her descent into madness.  Gosh I wish that was better explored.<br /><br />Also Gale is clearly close to Katniss but she looks at him as a big brother of sorts.  The romantic triangle in the book is underplayed in favor of the actual Games themselves.<br /><br />The rest of the film deals with Katniss volunteering to be a Tribute in place of her sister (which would clearly be a death sentence), her naivety and her strength in terms of survival, of trust and of taking on the false pretenses of the Capitol society for her own and others' survival.<br /><br />Ultimate Reality Show:<br /><br />The Hunger Games is the ultimate reality show.  I wrote up as much in my earlier book review.  The direction of the film was the best part of the film!  Close-up of mouth and eye as Katniss breathes and centers before releasing the bow.  Haymitch dealing with his own alcoholism and defeatism as he shapes up Katniss (this is done better in the book where he is a falling down drunk!) and Katniss as she is torn apart emotionally in losing some of her dearest friends.  The ending is especially tense and brought to mind the same intensity from the book's ending.  Don't worry, no spoilers, but you don't want to miss that!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Hunger Games is entertaining and does take the best of the book and translates it to film through concentrating on the reality game show / gladiator aspect of the Games.  The colored hair, futuristic ambiance and the arrogant superiority of President Snow and his gang, really tie together a great little tale, though I'm afraid the readers of the book may be disappointed.  I wasn't.<br /><br />More Village?  Any word on District 13?  The struggle between the Girl on Fire and the cold, calculating Snow?  Anything on the \\"pit crew\\" who put Kat together for the Games?

B005GFPZYK|3.0|I'm not quite sure why I bought this book.  Maybe its because I quite like history and there's little yet available on the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan - too soon perhaps, definitely too partisan.  Anyway, I thought this might be an interesting insight. It wasn't.<br /><br />I like Kyle's writing style, but you have to be in the mood for it.  Its like he's standing at the top of the class telling you all about it, sometimes beating his chest, sometimes pulling straight from the heart.  I have no doubt he loves what he did, and his loyalty to his country and fellow soldiers is unstinting and very admirable, but the book didn't really tell me anything except that there seems to be a mis-match between the top brass and the guys on the ground - an age-old conflict in itself.<br /><br />The book never let me in. I felt like I was getting a very small part of the whole, and while that's fine in one respect, I didn't feel like I was getting all of Kyle's side either so I was at a loss entirely.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it overall - I whipped through it in about two days - but I was left a little disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a fun and addicted game. its fun for the whole family. I loved this game right away. You will injoy it i promise.

B003EYVXV4|1.0|WARNING : May contain nuts.....uhh...spoilers.<br /><br />This film genuinely challenged my preconceptions. Until now, I happily believed that \\"Twilight\\" was the most stupid pop culture phenomenon that ever existed, but I am tempted to believe that the \\"Hunger Games\\" could actually knock it off it's pedestal.<br />Which is especially disappointing since the character of Katniss Everdeen is such a strong female figure, and a refreshing change from all the insufferable damsels that have been terrorizing mankind in recent years.<br />In fact, the whole concept of the \\"Hunger Games\\" is really intriguing, but it turns out to be a shamefully wasted opportunity.<br />But I'll get to that later.<br /><br />First, the technical aspects of the film - and there's not much good to say about them.<br />While the script appears to be acceptable, the film is overlong and has a tendency to drag.<br />The cinematography is dull and unimaginative, but it's difficult to spot anyway, since the excessive use of shaky cam renders the film almost unwatchable.<br />The score utterly forgettable, which is particularly surprising since I love James Newton Howard's work for the \\"Dark Knight\\" and \\"The Village\\", among others.<br />The acting has been praised a lot, but except Jennifer Lawrence, who delivers a very strong performance, there's little acting in it. Peeta spends 140 minutes with the exact same facial expression, the other tributes are afterthoughts, and while Tucci and his cohorts are truly amusing, all they do is embody caricatures. It must have been fun to do and is fun to watch, but I don't consider it to be real acting.<br /><br />The real problem is the story itself and the way it is presented.<br />Personally I think that the Hunger Games are not a practical method of coercion; I can't imagine a dictatorship relying on such a device would be very successful.<br />Real dictatorships work because they concentrate their efforts on some declared \\"enemy\\", by subjecting people theyconsider \\"unworthy\\" to torture and genocide.<br />Thereby implanting a deluded sense of unity in their \\"official\\" population.<br />I can't imagine that people watching their own children being murdered on television would not rise up regularly. Just look at the French Revolution - starvation, ongoing wars and the decadence of the upper class were enough for one of the most formidable movements in history - deliberate murder was not necessary to make the people fight back.<br />Yet, the population of Panem does nothing. Since the barbaric games have been going on for 73 years, one wonders why they still have children, considering they can't feed them and they might be slaughtered any day.<br />Perhaps because they don't perceive the ritual as barbaric. Nobody seems to mind.<br />This lack of rebellion, lack of thought even, is my major problem with the story.<br /><br />One might say that's the whole point of a brainwashed civilization, and that's true.<br />That's where it gets interesting. And that's where the story fails completely, because the moviemakers seem to be just as brainwashed as the Panemians.<br />They never once step back to show the audience how sick this idea really is.<br />Never once do we see any character reflect on it, nobody protests about being thrown into an arena to die. Nobody has any objections to kill. Nobody questions this most gruesome event, or the authorities.<br />Regrettably, this makes the characters incredibly flat.<br />When they are lifted up into the arena, waiting for the countdown to the bloodbath, all in a starting grid position, I was oddly reminded of an annual sports event at my grade school. It was of course perfectly harmless, but since I was never an athletic child, I despised it wholeheartedly, and more often than not, I simply resisted and stayed home that day.<br />So why was I reminded of this pedestrian event in a scene where 24 kids get ready to slaughter each other ?<br />Because not one of them shows any reaction. Nobody panics. Nobody cries. Nobody throws up. No nervous breakdowns. No nothing. They act like they are trained killing machines, but given the fact that they have been plucked out of their lives to fight to death against their will, this makes absolutely no sense.<br />I was also reminded of a scene in \\"Gladiator\\", when the fighters are waiting to go out into the arena (not the Colosseum). One of them is shown literally wetting his sandals, and while it's not pretty to look at, it is poignant. And we are talking about a grown man here, who is not confronted with having to kill 12-yearolds to survive.<br />He simply knows he's going to die an unpleasant death, and that unsettles him. I can relate to that....<br />But, no such thing in the Hunger Games.<br />Nobody has any problem taking life either.<br />Which reminded me of another scene in another Russell Crowe flick, \\"Proof Of Life\\".<br />There, the Crowe character has to cut somebody's throat during a rescue operation.<br />Crowe, a masterful actor, shows his character's suppressed urge to vomit as he does this - and this guy is supposed to be a soldier, turned into a private security person. Somebody trained and used to killing.<br />Yet, the tributes go about their task with robotic efficiency, which I find most perplexing.<br />Well, enough of that now.<br /><br />A word on the adoring public reaction to the film :<br />I have read in another negative review here that a fan of the series was unhappy, because at the end, only Katniss is presented with a crown, when Peeta should have one, too.<br />To me, that says everything. Apparently, the thing is being watched as some sort of pageant, complete with the earlier styling and talkshow scenes.<br />An underdog's claim to fame, a grittier version of American Idol. The fact that children are murdering other children seems to have no bearing on it.<br />Apparently, the victory matters. And so does the crown.<br />If I would find myself in the most unfortunate position of being a Hunger Games tribute, and in the even more unlikely situation of having won, unathletic and flinching as I am.......well, I would spit on the crown and throw it into the president's face in disgust.<br />On live TV. And then they could shoot me for all that I care, for I could not live with myself anyway.<br /><br />But the movie seems to inspire no such reaction in anybody else. At the theatre, everbody was having a jolly good time. The heroine is plucky and beautiful, she get's a lot of limelight, a crown and a puppy, and everybody's happy.<br />Well well. I heard somewhere that the story was supposed to be a dark parable, a fierce criticism of our society's addiction to gore and reality TV.<br />If that is so, it turned upon itself in a screeching swirl.<br />I certainly didn't feel like part of a socially aware audience, watching a daring, important, critical film. I felt surrounded by a hundred \\"Neo-Roman\\" brats, watching handsome guys in tight clothes whacking each other.<br /><br />It's just another triumph of hypocrisy. Let's bait a teenage crowd with a sick little premise, but don't forget to add a gallon of softener. Don't make it too intense. Don't make anybody think. We wouldn't want the little ones to have nightmares, now would we ??<br /><br />Such a wasted opportunity should be awarded with -10 stars, but since I have to give it one, it might as well be for Jennifer Lawrence's skilled and engaging performance.<br />Unfortunately, she can't save this trainwreck.<br /><br />May your brain be ever in your head.........
B007CW2FCA|5.0|To commemorate the 200th anniversary of Beethoven's birth in 1970, High Fidelity magazine published a comprehensive survey, in book form, of the composer's recordings that were available at the time. Their distinguished piano critic, Harris Goldsmith, wrote the sections on the piano music and concertos, and his opinions and insights are still valuable today. Of the Arrau cycle of the 32 sonatas, Goldsmith wrote the following:<br /><br />\\"Following Arrau through the sonatas was a stimulating, sometimes perplexing experience: stimulating because of the pianist's mastery and profound insight into the music; perplexing because although I am a confirmed adherent to an opposite musical polarity (e.g., the Schnabel/Toscanini axis) I kept finding myself fascinated and drawn into Arrau's interpretations in spite of myself. Granted, I look for metrical severity and Arrau's inflected phrasing is sometimes stretched to theoretical limits; I also gravitate toward fast tempos and headstrong brio, while Arrau's approach more often than not is leisurely and reasoned. But this is not the clich&eacute;-ridden self-indulgence of a typical stock-in-trade 'Romantic' pianist: there is vast scholarship and harmonic analysis behind Arrau's seeming arbitrariness and it always manages to clarify some aspect of the writing. The pianist is helped, of course, by a superbly finished technique and a fabulous tone - solid, velvety rich, full of glint and gleaming color. Chords are luscious and well balanced, his scales are even and caressing. Arrau takes care to reveal inner melodic lines; he is scrupulous about observing rests, and unlike so many players, always begins his appoggiaturas on (rather than before) the beat. He is, I might add, the only artist to observe every repeat (which one might consider a mixed blessing). These details are important, of course, but ought not cloud the real point of Arrau's music-making which provides a deeply expressive, subjective thesis about Beethoven's music.\\" (\\"The Recordings of Beethoven as Viewed by the Critics of High Fidelity,\\" 1971)<br /><br />The \\"subjective thesis\\" observed by Goldsmith was expressed by Arrau himself in an illuminating essay that accompanied the Philips box set of the pianist's complete sonata cycle in 1971:<br /><br />\\"Like all cultural heroes, Beethoven exemplifies in his creative output all the spiritual and psychic battles of the mythic hero - the hero who is given superhuman tasks to overcome and who after untold struggles (truly bloodied but undaunted) emerges the victor and, as in the case of the greatest creative giants (Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Goethe) finally attains the highest state of self-realization and illumination. This is especially true of Beethoven, who struggled creatively possibly on a more titanic scale than even Michelangelo - in the sense that he wrought his works into shape with an inexhaustible inner sense and vision of perfection and completion. In the end he reached a mystical union with the godhead, as it were, and on a higher plane of transcendence than almost anyone else in the history of Western art.\\" (\\"Thoughts on Beethoven and the Piano Sonatas\\")<br /><br />This outlook limns Arrau's interpretations of the Beethoven sonatas. My own point of view after having lived with these recordings for over forty years is that Arrau's genius, diverse as it was given his masterful interpretations of Liszt, Brahms, Debussy, and Schumann, revealed itself most completely in the music of Beethoven, especially those works (and there were many) with which he fully identified. The supreme statements of Arrau's Beethoven can be heard in the Appassionata, Funeral March, Pastoral, Les Adieux, Waldstein, Moonlight and Tempest sonatas, as well as the five late sonatas (opp. 101, 106, 109, 110 and 111). He also turned in exceptional performances of opp. 2, no.3; 10, no. 3; 27, no. 1 (Sonata Quasi una Fantasia); 54; 78 and 90 as well as the Eroica and C Minor variations. Infact, his playing and insights are on such a consistently high level that out of the 32 sonatas, Arrau hardly registered a \\"miss.\\"<br /><br />Of the last five sonatas Arrau pondered \\"Where did all of that come from? [How did Beethoven] enter spheres of such transcendent meaning as were never encountered in music before or, in all truth, since? Who could foretell such a span of evolution which sees him create at the end what can only be called a metaphysical language of music...where trills become a trembling of the soul and arpeggios reach out into the infinite altogether.... In Op. 111...Beethoven reaches into cosmic spaces which open up into infinitude, into a state of mystical rapture which Goethe called 'der Fall nach oben' - the fall upward....\\"<br /><br />Given this level of perception, it's no wonder that Arrau's readings of the triple opus numbered sonatas uniquely penetrate the inner dimension of this music. While not everyone approved of his approach to late Beethoven (Harris Goldsmith called some of the interpretations too rhetorical and \\"Furtwanglerish\\"), I think these documents reign supreme in the canon of Beethoven recordings.<br /><br />After decades of listening to Beethoven including the cycles set down by Schnabel, Kempff, Brendel, Frank, and Backhaus among others, it is Arrau whose recordings are the most consistently insightful and compelling, not to mention the most technically polished. This reissue set on the Decca label deserves a place in every music library.<br /><br />Addendum: For a perspective of Arrau at work, I highly recommend a recently issued 2-dvd set of the pianist's appearances at the 1970 and 1977 Beethovenfest in Bonn: [[ASIN:B004TWOXI0 Claudio Arrau: Beethoven Piano Sonatas]]. Between the two recitals Arrau plays eight Beethoven sonatas (op. 2, no. 3; op. 27 no. 1; op. 27, no. 2; op. 53; op. 57; op. 81a; op. 109; and op. 111). These are unforgettable documents that capture the pianist at his titanic best.<br /><br />Addendum II:<br /><br />There have been a number of comments regarding the sonics on this set, so I thought I would add my own to the mix. The previous Philips box set, which was issued in 1998, offered 24 bit sound and I can't say that it was much of an improvement over the original cd set except for the elimination of intrusive electronic clicks that some mistakenly believed were Arrau's fingernails striking the keys (as it happens, his nails were trimmed to the nub). There's only so much that can be done with fifty year old source material and it wouldn't surprise me if maximum remediation had already been done by the engineers at Philips.<br /><br />Having said that, with the exception of the above-mentioned electronic noise in the original cd box set which has been corrected, I've never found the sound picture to be \\"claustrophobic\\" or \\"boxy\\" - descriptions that have been repeated numerous times over the years. To the contrary, I think this set projects a good deal of Arrau's unique sound - the richness, the color, the organ-like fullness and warmth. The sound picture, however, is not completely consistent. First of all, Arrau began his cycle by recording sonatas nos. 11-15 in 1962, and these are the only ones I find to be sonically challenged. They sound thin and rather strained, but they're still way ahead of what EMI's engineers were producing for Arrau in 1960 (an example of which is [[ASIN:B0002VEQG6 Chopin: Piano Sonata No. 3; Fantasy]]). Sixteen months later, he recorded the Pathetique, Waldstein and Hammerklavier sonatas and followed this with a batch of early sonatas (nos. 1-7) in 1964. The rest were recorded over various sessions in 1965 and 1966. The point of all this is that while I tend to listen to the sonatas in chronological order, they were not recorded that way; however, the sound, never less than acceptable, definitely improves along the way - even though it may seem variable if you listen chronologically.fact, his playing and insights are on such a consistently high level that out of the 32 sonatas, Arrau hardly registered a \\"miss.\\"<br /><br />Of the last five sonatas Arrau pondered \\"Where did all of that come from? [How did Beethoven] enter spheres of such transcendent meaning as were never encountered in music before or, in all truth, since? Who could foretell such a span of evolution which sees him create at the end what can only be called a metaphysical language of music...where trills become a trembling of the soul and arpeggios reach out into the infinite altogether.... In Op. 111...Beethoven reaches into cosmic spaces which open up into infinitude, into a state of mystical rapture which Goethe called 'der Fall nach oben' - the fall upward....\\"<br /><br />Given this level of perception, it's no wonder that Arrau's readings of the triple opus numbered sonatas uniquely penetrate the inner dimension of this music. While not everyone approved of his approach to late Beethoven (Harris Goldsmith called some of the interpretations too rhetorical and \\"Furtwanglerish\\"), I think these documents reign supreme in the canon of Beethoven recordings.<br /><br />After decades of listening to Beethoven including the cycles set down by Schnabel, Kempff, Brendel, Frank, and Backhaus among others, it is Arrau whose recordings are the most consistently insightful and compelling, not to mention the most technically polished. This reissue set on the Decca label deserves a place in every music library.<br /><br />Addendum: For a perspective of Arrau at work, I highly recommend a recently issued 2-dvd set of the pianist's appearances at the 1970 and 1977 Beethovenfest in Bonn: [[ASIN:B004TWOXI0 Claudio Arrau: Beethoven Piano Sonatas]]. Between the two recitals Arrau plays eight Beethoven sonatas (op. 2, no. 3; op. 27 no. 1; op. 27, no. 2; op. 53; op. 57; op. 81a; op. 109; and op. 111). These are unforgettable documents that capture the pianist at his titanic best.<br /><br />AddendumII:<br /><br />There have been a number of comments regarding the sonics on this set, so I thought I would add my own to the mix. The previous Philips box set, which was issued in 1998, offered 24 bit sound and I can't say that it was much of an improvement over the original cd set except for the elimination of intrusive electronic clicks that some mistakenly believed were Arrau's fingernails striking the keys (as it happens, his nails were trimmed to the nub). There's only so much that can be done with fifty year old source material and it wouldn't surprise me if maximum remediation had already been done by the engineers at Philips.<br /><br />Having said that, with the exception of the above-mentioned electronic noise in the original cd box set which has been corrected, I've never found the sound picture to be \\"claustrophobic\\" or \\"boxy\\" - descriptions that have been repeated numerous times over the years. To the contrary, I think this set projects a good deal of Arrau's unique sound - the richness, the color, the organ-like fullness and warmth. The sound picture, however, is not completely consistent. First of all, Arrau began his cycle by recording sonatas nos. 11-15 in 1962, and these are the only ones I find to be sonically challenged. They sound thin and rather strained, but they're still way ahead of what EMI's engineers were producing for Arrau in 1960 (an example of which is [[ASIN:B0002VEQG6 Chopin: Piano Sonata No. 3; Fantasy]]). Sixteen months later, he recorded the Pathetique, Waldstein and Hammerklavier sonatas and followed this with a batch of early sonatas (nos. 1-7) in 1964. The rest were recorded over various sessions in 1965 and 1966. The point of all this is that while I tend to listen to the sonatas in chronological order, they were not recorded that way; however, the sound, never less than acceptable, definitely improves along the way - even though it may seem variable if you listen chronologically.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I haven't seen the original Swedish film on which this English version is based, so my review is based purely on David Fincher's movie.<br />The movie is beautifully photographed, its snowy setting underscoring the chilling storyline.  Its intricate plot demands close attention, as does its deliberate, slow-paced first half.  The second half picks up once the titular character joins forces with the journalist to track down an elusive serial killer.  Rooney Mara shoots to stardom as the unconventional leading lady--a multi-pierced, tattooed, antisociable computer hacker--a role that garnered her a Best Actress Oscar nod.  Mara certainly dominates the film in her edgy, complex performance.  Daniel Craig is a competent, if unexciting, actor who suffers the James Bond curse---its hard to separate his 007 persona from his other roles.  I found it hard to be impressed with this performance as I did in his recent films like DREAM HOUSE and COWBOYS AND ALIENS.  Oscar winner Christopher Plummer, the always imposing Stellan Skarsgardm and the elegant Joely Richardson round out the supporting cast.  Yorick van Wanginingen as Mara's repulsive money manager is especially convincing.  The rape scenes are some of the most disturbing in recent cinema.<br />GIRL is definitely a commendable film, but its also quite revolting in its ugly storyline.  It's not easy to watch at times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read...and I've read many things. This book is all I could ever want in a book. It's thrilling, adventurous, romantic, and just flat out phenonenal. I could not put this book down for a second. This book is in top ranks. I just cannot express how much this book has effected me. It makes me want to make sure that our government doesn't take too much control. I am dying to see the movie and I will beg at my parent's feet to take me!
0812974611|3.0|**NOTE:  There will probably be spoilers in this review.**<br /><br />For historical detail and context, this novel is very good.  I enjoyed learning about the Roman aqueduct system, which piqued my curiosity to learn more.  The descriptions of Vesuvius' eruption are excellent and really gave me a sense of the sequence and complexity of the event beyond the ordinary \\"the ground shook and the mountain spewed a column of ash\\" kind of thing.  I was never particularly engaged with the characters, however.  Attilius returning to Pompeii during the eruption--and surviving--all to find a girl he met a couple of times, was far-fetched and disappointing.  I'm glad Harris didn't go with a Hollywood ending, but the ending reinforced for me how flimsy the characters were in the first place.  Overall, I recommend reading it for the historical detail but not if you're looking for a good story, and certainly not a good romance.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This has been a great series. BBC is doing a better job than Hollywood. Watch the whole DVD the first night. Great price.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is so addicting. 3 dollars? worth like 20. no ads cool with space things. it couldn't get any better
B007DA2FHG|1.0|This movie was laughable. Every single performance was over-acted, hyper-melodramatic, and cheesy in the worst sense. I half expected the horses and main characters to break out into song like some animated Disney children's film. In fact had this movie been an animated Disney musical it would have improved the watch-ability by lightyears. If you want a cartoony, horse themed travesty of a WWI drama then by all means enjoy, but for anyone hoping to see a serious period piece or thoughtful war drama, beware... it's a joke. It's just a goofy story about a farm boy (who curdles milk with an accent akin to Samwise Gamgee from LOTR) whose pet horse gets sent off to be a service beast in WWI, making unlikely horsey friends, and other equally one dimensional human characters, along the way back to his boy. I spent most of the movie trying not to laugh out loud at the absurdness of it all. Should have spared us all the agonizing 2 and a half hours and shipped Ol' Joey off to the glue factory in the first 20 minutes. This film being nominated for Best Picture speaks volumes for what an awful year it was for film. Boo I say
B0054JZC6E|3.0|requires alot of concentration lots of people can play this game for parents a great game to keep kids quiet
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book has a great premise and is beautifully written, but I was disappointed with the ending. It was also difficult to keep up with until I was able to understand that the author was changing perspectives. When I realized this, I thought, \\"This is cool,\\" but I expected more to happen when the perspectives finally converged. There was so much rich detail, yet not much actually happened in the novel. In the end, I enjoyed it, but it's a once-only read for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You have GOT to read this! It's the best book you will ever read in your entire life! Loved it!!!!

B005HSL626|1.0|I love Fruit Ninja on my cell phone, and my daughter wanted to download it on her tablet. So, we go to download this app, and found that it wasn't compatible with her generic brand tablet. But she can get the paid version of the SAME APP and it is compatible. Not happy about that. I think it's a way to weasel more money from us.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|kind of confusing because of all the different games. there are some that need to be explained better. pretty fun though!!!!
B000ZLFALS|4.0|This is an amazing Blu-Ray! The movie alone is great but the special features and the fact that its in Blu_Ray quality just makes it even better.. If you like Beatles music and amazing imagery this movie is for you.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|This is the new guard after TeKanawa, Sutherland etc.  It is superbly staged, the performances of the principals are divine. And then Ildebrando as King Henry... There is an artist to be looking out for.  This is probably the best Opera DVD I have in my collection, and I have a fair number!

B000025Y9I|1.0|Received this used CD after several days and was very anxious to hear the one song on it 'Texas' that was the reason I ordered.  I uploaded to iTunes and put on iPhone and when I went to listen it was just very scratchy and you were not able to understand or hear the song.  so I listened to the other songs and they were just as bad so I deleted the entire CD.  I guess I will have to order new one.  The other four used CD's I ordered were fine.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|After reading the Twilight saga it was difficult to find books as much enthralling...I first found Fae Fever Series (a long time ago) and then I found Rebecca Hamilton on twitter. It is my favorite book now!!! At first I was very disapointed because he was exclusive to Amazon. I bought a Kindle Fire from ebay and the first book I bought was the Forever Girl. I was very pleasantly surprise!!! First of all she camp her characters in a totally normal town with normal life, then her principal  character, Sophia, begin to experience some really weird things in her life. And then new people are introduce and we then discover a totally new paranormal and addictive world. Ya I said addictive cuz, after that you wouldn't want to return to you're average boring life...more now that Charles is in you're life! There's new power never experience with those kind of character and a paranormal world well craft! And where missing just enough information to keep us hooked and waiting for a second book. Suffice to say, in a few word, this book is smoking hot, refreshing, paranormal, addicting, fantastic (or fangtastic...it depends!!! =P), romantic, unexpected, mysterious and I could go on and on like that. So a few words can't describe it since Rebecca and her book is so awsome!!! Now I can't wait to read her next one!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book captured my attention from the first page, pulling me into the story to the point that I couldn't put it down even if I had wanted to.
B0033AX26I|4.0|[[ASIN:B005FNH13Q Owl Bird Wooden Dangle Earrings]]These earrings are true to colour very cute maybe a little larger than I wanted but still very happy.  They arrived before due date which was good.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I'm so happy I like this album, because her last one \\"Hard Candy\\" was just terrible compared to this one. Great dance album with a few ballads. standout tracks : Gang Bang (my favorite and apparently Madonna's too) , Turn Up The Radio, I'm Addicted, Love Spent and the ballads Masterpiece & Falling Free. The first 2 singles aren't the best songs on the album. Lucky for me I will be able to see her here in the first show of her new tour!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Loaded right up and is quick to switch between radar and the home screen. I like this one better than the Weather Bug on my phone./
B004EPZ03O|4.0|My whole family (three kids between 5 and 8) enjoyed this movie, and all felt it was a 4 out of 5 stars - not spectacular unless you are a diehard Muppets fan, but certainly a lot of fun. I watched the Muppets growing up, but was never a diehard fan, and my kids have never seen anything with them, so I wasn't sure we would enjoy this. But it's very warm-hearted, with lots of fun musical numbers that kept my kids engaged, while there were also enough 'inside' jokes to keep my husband and I amused. The story centers around two small town brothers - one man (played by Jason Segal) and one muppet named Walter. Segal's character has dated Amy Adam's character for 10 years, and they are off to Los Angeles for an anniversary trip. They bring Walter along to visit the Muppet Studio, only to discover it is about to be destroyed by a greedy oil baron unless the Muppets reunite for a telethon to raise $10 million. The writing pokes lots of fun at movie conventions and the Muppets themselves. Fun, clean family fare.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|I am a lover of all things mythological.  I go into these types of movies not expecting Citizen Kane but a good \\"popcorn\\" flick.<br /><br />This movie was bad.  The story was disjointed, the characters on dimensional, the fight scenes conventional.  I could not wait for the movie to end.<br /><br />The story had potential but it was an epic swing and miss.
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|My husband and I got plenty of laughs out of this ensemble comedy starring Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Alan Alda, Mathew Broderick and more. Stiller's character  manages a NYC luxury condo where Alda plays a wealthy Madoff-like character who is charged with swindling lots of people - including the employees of the condo - out of their life savings. Eddie Murphy is the thief Stiller teams up with - along with several other hotel employees and Broderick's character - to try and get some of their money back. I thought Murphy was the funniest I have seen him in awhile, and him and Stiller played off each other well. Alda and Broderick are mostly the comedic straight men here, but they do a fine job. The story itself has some holes, and the ending is not wholly satisfying, but those are forgivable in a comedy like this. So overall, fun and worth a watch.
B003EYVXV4|2.0|MOVIE REVIEW #25: \\" The Hunger Games \\"<br /><br />Well....I'm going to be the only one to give this movie a not-so-nice review - I'm sure, but let me clarify I have NOT read the book and I am only basing my review on the entertainment value of the film - as a film. I have heard MANY times the book and the series itself is very good.<br /><br />First, I want to say Gary Ross, the director, of this film, has done some wonderful films like `Pleasantville' and 'Seabiscut' - as well as penning the movies `Big' and `Dave' (two of my favorite comedies) - so choosing him for this film might not have been the best choice.<br /><br />Secondly, the things that I liked about the film is - as he always does, the performance of both Stanley Tucci (Burlesque, Julie & Julia, Devil Wears Prada) and the MC of a modern times talk-show and Woody Harrelson (Cheers, Zombieland, 2012) as an extremist publicist for this barbaric game the future has set up. The two of them made the movie interesting and tolerable. The lead character, of the games, played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bones, X-Men: First Class) was extremely versatile in her character portrayal and her need to drive the movie forward - especially when she did a wonderful job with a smaller character (played by Amanda Stenberg of Columbiana) in her emotional connection of the games being a real threat and that winning means a lot more than surviving.<br /><br />Which leads me now to - Thirdly - why the film didn't work. First of all the film is shot literally in close-up. At one point I was wondering if these people had any legs or waistlines. An unusual choice for direction a big screen, big budget film....also, I guess we are all suppposed to be used to the NYPD Tv style that ended up being `Cloverfield'-like photography. The moment any action occurred the camera moved violently. It was hard ot follow action...who bit who...who killed who when...how...etc. Call me old school, but when I trained in film making - I was taught that movies were supposed to capture life cinematically....on sticks and stands (tripods)...to capture real (or fantasy-like) moments on film. I had to look away from the screen several times because like Cloverfield - it gave me a headache. It was too distracting for me to stay interested in those scenes...and there were many of them.<br /><br />The future capital is portrayed as this elaborate `empire-like' city with lots of color and style that is over-the-top but very colorful and creative, the costumes outside the district are imaginative and broad, but everything else is basic back-woodsy and what you would expect from a society that wared against itself and created 12 separate - gated and patrolled areas that you could be killed for if you attempted to leave them.<br /><br />The concept of sacrificing your young in a lottery as promise of `hope' for the poor - as the then President states (Played quietly by Donald Southerland of Invasion of the Body Snatcher and Commander In Chief) - makes for an interesting society that evolved from a civil war her in the US states. High concept idea - but a low concept executive of the film for me. And, the script has the rule makers changing the rules as the game progresses...to me, unjustifiably for the story - especially since these `Hunger Games' have been running for 74 years.<br /><br />The film was slow in parts and it also has some things that you are expected to `suspend your disbelief' with no real logic, explanation or purpose. I have to believe the book explains more and justifies some of the actions both the game players and the game makers do.<br /><br />So for my money...I would wait for the DVD, Cable or Netflix....I had no expectations going in other than - what all the `buzz' was regarding this great book - which as I write this - I am absolutely sure is better than this film. My suggestion , don't read the book first...you'll probably be disappointed in the film.t that movies were supposed to capture life cinematically....on sticks and stands (tripods)...to capture real (or fantasy-like) moments on film.

B003Y5H5BA|4.0|MOVIE REVIEW #27: \\" 21 Jump Street \\"<br /><br />Talk about a pleasant surprise. I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film, but I can see why the reviews have been generally positive. Directors Phil Lord (Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs) and Chris Miller (Again Cloudy...) to a old TV show popular with teens and gave it a modern twist..... story by it's Executive Producer and Star Jonah Hill (Moneyball, Knocked Up) and Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgram Vs. The World) and its screenplay by Bacall it basically tell of stud and a nerd and everything that comes with each working against each other to eventually being best friends.<br /><br />Not taking itself too seriously it shows two police academy graduates being assigned a special undercover operation involving a high school. Jonah is partnered with Channing Tatum (Dear John, G.I. Joe, The Dilema) and they eventually realized they complement each other with their own personal special abilities.<br /><br />In the process they go through hilarious scenes involving \\"accidental\\" use of drugs, some wonderful high school tuxedos of the eighties and a running joke involving a series of questionable bikers that have one of the biggest TWISTS at the end of the film. (Spoilers!)<br /><br />Rob Riggle (The Hangover, The Other Guys) gives an over-the-top performance as a High School coach with `issues' and a phony front to students Dave France (Superbad, Fight Night) and Brie Larson (13 Going On 30, Scott Pilgram Vs. The World) who believe he is what he is.<br /><br />Meanwhile Channing and Jonah are guided by a over-zealous Police Captain played by Ice Cube (Fridays, First Sunday, Barber Shop) who thinks that this is a mission only they can handle because of the youthful looks - but will fail because - even together they are not so smart.<br /><br />The film has lots of comedy, action, adventure, close-calls and some very clever dialogue.....not to mention that `Spoiler' - I mentioned earlier....do you wanna know? Then read on. If not STOP HERE!<br /><br />Two original series regulars make an appearance in this reinvention of an 80's TV series (that by the way, makes fun of itself by commenting that all sargents do now is try and reboot old things from the 80's) - the real' 21 Jump Street' stars of the ORIGINAL series Johnny Depp (21 Jump Street, Pirates of the Caribbean 1, 2 and 3), Richard Grieco (21 Jump Street ,Point Doom ) and Peter DeLouise (Seaquest, 21 Jump Street) have an amazingly funny came...that borders on `black comedy' because of what happens to them.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|\\"The Lucky One\\" by Nicholas Sparks is as amazing as everything else he writes. This book is along the lines of great titles such as \\"The Notebook\\", \\"A Walk to Remember\\", \\"The Guradian\\", and \\"The Rescue.\\" I am so excited to see this great book play out on the movie screen in April. Sparks does a fantastic job of telling the story from the viewpoints of all three main characters making the reader feel as if they are watching a movie. This book will be adored by Sparks fans, and make new fans out of first time readers.
B005LAIH4K|4.0|MOVIE REVIEW #26: \\" The Lorax \\"<br /><br />Now here is some family fun with a great message! Some people may think it's preachy and others may think there is some ulterior motive being subliminally sent out to children...but what's wrong with a positive message that promotes life and not death.<br /><br />This film was surprisingly entertaining, funny and a bit of action adventure swing to it as well.  Rated PG for the cartoon violence that may be interpreted with the somewhat mature theme of `saving the environment' - specifically trees - the movie tells the tale of town that is entirely plastic in nature...so plastic that they have to sell `air', because the environment is so bad.<br /><br />Giving reverence to everything Dr. Suess - with lots of embellishments, director's Chris Renaud (Despicable Me) and Kyle Balda (director of many animated shorts) the film creatively and colorful explains the world that was created because nature was destroyed. Tree upon tree chopped down for the onset of Plastic and all the bi-products that come from it. Poisons, toxins and bad air - all in one place called Sneedville.<br /><br />It has light-hearted music, witty comedy and even a few wonderful songs you might find yourself humming along with. Headed in the cast is Danny DeVito (Taxi, War of the Roses, batman Returns) himself as The Lorax. The keeper of the trees. He befriends and entrepreneur voiced by Ed Helms (The Office and The Hangover) who is convinced money over nature is far more important. Hence, the destruction of the environment.<br /><br />Zach Efron (High School Musical, 17 again, Charlie St. Cloud) and Taylor Swift (Valentine's day) learn what the truth was and is and with the help of Grandma - ever so cleverly played by Betty White (The Golden Girls, The Proposal) herself, they learn the truth of how important Trees are.<br /><br />Fun, funny and really a family film it might make you think next time you pick up a water bottle....this film has a lot of heart and a lot of funny action. It was a big box office draw when it opened and people are still coming back. Enjoy!a lot of funny action. It was a big box office draw when it opened and people are still coming back. Enjoy!
1451627289|3.0|* * * SPOILERS * * *<br /><br />First of all, I should admit that Stephen King's terrific for doing this speculation of \\"what would happen if JFK was not assassinated\\"/time travel effort. When he writes, people read, LOT of people read.<br /><br />But, you know . . . speaking to the premise of this 800+ page lb.'er (hardcover anyway; paper books, forever!!!!!), if you have the golden chance to go back in time to correct something that most viewed as a negative outcome, a correction that would, let's say, give the world more time with one of our greatest statesman, then, I ask, with regard to \\"11/22/63,\\" what in HECK was Jake/George doing falling in love and, thusly, creating potential for that to get in the way of (and it nearly did) such a responsible task?<br /><br />I mean, if Jake/George had been THAT much in love with Sadie, hey, he shoulda' just let 11/22/63 happen because: 1) he's found the love of his life; and 2) he knows what'll happen in a world where a JFK ends up getting assassinated; it's a world where such a relationship could be sustained (in the case of \\"11/22/63\\", PREVENTING the assassination ended up having some very BAD \\"love repercussions\\" for Jake and Sadie.  Indeed, the MOTHER of all \\"love repercussions\\" happened, right?).  I know. I know. I know. Not a fair assessment here with ye old \\"well, you don't PLAN on falling in love\\" adage.  I'm just saying Jake/George needed to have his \\"eyes on the prize\\" of saving Kennedy.  And I know it's not fair (and you just plain look silly when doing so to a Stephen King) to tell an artist how to express. But, man, I COULD NOT HELP but think this book longer than its own good (after page 600 thereabouts I actually laughed out loud thinking, \\"is it IN King's contract with his publisher to make something this long? And was the whole school play thing filler? That went for, like, 200-300 pages alone! [!]\\").  I wasn't convinced how fast that love thang happened.<br /><br />I see a lot of \\"wow, what an ending\\" \\"he did it right\\" type fare here in the review forum for \\"11/22/63\\". I know King rides with Shakespeare in being able to deliver, well, tragic endings and be able to retain a popular fanbase . . . but, the whole \\"charred/scared/future land even after changing something in the past that SHOULD have resulted in a positive thing\\" when Jake/George saved JFK, I mean, eek, King.  No, King, no. If I gotta stand alone and say, \\"no, sir . . . JFK surviving an assassination THAT cunning, by a Communist sympathizer. No, no way would things sour\\" or at least it SHOULDN'T have been when you can do all kinds of things w/a fictional platform, then, I'll be a Toshiro Mifune standing in the middle of town hea. There needed to be more of a richer conclusion when Jake came back to 2011 after saving JFK.<br /><br />And I'm not talking that NO tragic situation should've or would've \\"tangented\\" from a surviving JFK; but, mega EARTHQUAKES???? A few days AFTER JFK survives? \\"The past is obdurate\\" . . . we're told that throughout in this book.  But, I also kept thinking pasts are DIFFERENT in each string.  So, in THAT timeline string -- which means that JFK survives -- why would time be so angry as to create earthquakes and have JFK suffer in his 2nd term disproportionate to his aims? King STILL coulda' had George/Jake and Sadie dance in that future (which happened, yes?  I simply cringed at the seeming non-King-ish ending of Sadie giving an \\"I remember you from somewhere\\" which is par for the course with love un-united American/time-travel style.  I mean, c'mon.  Is this the Oxygen channel sci-fi'/time-travel offering of the year, or what?  King mentions that his son helps with the ending.  I think dad should stick to his own instincts if Jr. had a hand in coming up with the man-from-the-future dances with the she-grey-haired social conscious). I mean, give some hardcore -- he makes gov'ment agents look bad in \\"Firestarter\\", so, where was the CIA being dismantled in a JFK second term, or similar ilk, you gotta wonder? Would've been in line w/Stephen King's apparent politics (to which he rightfully has a right to, I'm not complaining about that, make no mistake [this will be important to keep in mind for the next paragraph]).<br /><br />Anybody confused with the Afterward, too? Through the whole book, and even in a few King interviews I caught (and King says this in the afterward, too, adding a \\"Tabitha's the\\" one who takes note of the conspiracy theories of events 11/22/1963 underscore), he's convinced Oswald acted alone, but, at the same time, adding that the collective hate of Confederate types guided Oswald's bullet's what I got from King's hint when he mentioned the infamous Zapruder frame.<br /><br />One thing that was mentioned . . . and this one just needs to be re-written for the paperback, yes, indeed (as I've seen mentioned in one or two or more message boards discussing the book), how the heck does Al suddenly have a visiting nurse to his house alla' sudden after the two minutes of Jake/George's first foray into 1958. And if you say, \\"well, Jake/George initial `going into 1958' helped provide that nurse,\\" then, why isn't Al a totally different person altogether? Would he even remember Jake/George?<br /><br />I mean, I don't get the mistakes Jake/George kept doing. Singing a \\"prior-to-existence\\" Rolling Stones song in the car when another song is playing on the radio (lemme know if I'm wrong here)? How could he make that mistake when he's well into \\"I am a time-traveller mode\\"? I dunno . . .<br /><br />The school play situation was simply a busted firecracker dud in the middle of it all. It could've been a separate novel or short story altogether. Methinks a horde of football players finding giddiness in acting in a school play creates a decent butterfly effect and/or watershed moment, no?<br /><br />I think I understood the whole \\"watershed\\"-events-when-it-comes-to-time-travel issue brought up in the book. I don't think it NEEDS to have such an impact (certainly not leading to magical earthquakes) when such events are prevented. If 09/11 never happened, 09/12's main headline would be something about Brangelina or whatever, you know? Victims of 09/11 would've lived and life would've gone on minus TSA. Think about it. And, heck, to me, we still woulda' gone after Saddam, Ahmadinejad, and Kim Jong Il. I mean, regardless of 09/11, their dreams of \\"nuclear\\" hung around them like bad henchmen; they didn't suddenly come up with such plans after the events of 09/11/2001, we can agree (or should).  Situations w/those three were coming to a head and going into the 21st century, they are threats.  And they would've been handled regardless.<br /><br />To me, writers of time-travel fiction need to get a better handle on that untamed bull on the butterfly effect (sorry to mix metaphors here). Describe the butterfly effect to your readers only once and really DO something with it, you know? Impress us. Don't auto-Orwellian a conclusion. Guess what? A butterfly effect happens as easily as I (and you) decide to have a glass of water instead of a can of coke. And every other action we do, especially legally and normally, in our day-to-day creates a butterfly effect.  Hitler's rejection as an artist, what?  Would've never been known had he went to work in a bakery and died of old age instead.  Right?<br /><br />I would tell King that \\"11/22/63\\"'s happy ending shouldn't ONLY have been about Jake/George and Sadie. Yes, yes, the 11/22/1963s and the 09/11/2001s happen in our world and, for those of us lucky enough (one sect) or by the grace of God (the rest of us) not to have any direct tragedy with such situations, well, we simply go on, as is needed for humanity to do so after such events, and live the rest of our lives, with our own happinesses, successes, and tragedies. Life goes and there are many butterfly effects. Do you SEE an earthquake every hour, on the hour in your real life? No.<br /><br />To be fair, King's most probably was satisfied with \\"11/22/63\\"'s ending (though, he MAY have had problems having, again, admitted that his son came up with a better ending, am I reading it correctly when S. King says so?).  But, heck, where was the KING ending, you know?  Who would've hated on, in a post-assassination attempt setting, JFK's entourage, walkin' `round in government bldg. surroundings in Dallas, and Oswald being carted off , walking `round in government bldg. settings, crossing paths in the chaos and JFK slapping him around when they got too close?  Who would've hated on Oswald, post-assassination attempt, asking to go to the restroom and Pennywise appearing in the toilet and eating Oswald up???  Sounds silly.  But, methinks the \\"King ending\\" wasn't there ('specially, sorry to reiterate, that last Jake/George and Sadie dance.  Sidenote: whenever King wrote [sorry if this is paraphrased] \\"life is dance\\", somewhat or other, in \\"11/22/63\\", Whodini's \\"Life is Like a Dance\\" rapped through my head, hahahhaha.  Whatever happened to those fellas anyways?]).<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" needed to have an ending that made those of us who wished that JFK live raise our fist when reading King's latest with a verbal and loud \\"right on!!!\\" the same way we did when Paul Sheldon gave Annie Wilkes her comeuppance. (again, not telling King how to express). King could've given it.  That feeling just wasn't there with what should've been one of his most important works.<br /><br />Magical earthquakes.

B0058VW36U|5.0|although I don't want to buy this I tried the free version and it was awesome. I just can't wait for more levels!
B005I4JG80|5.0|Druckerman's work is insightful, well-written, and fun. If you appreciate cultural comparisons (especially linguistic ones), you will enjoy this book. Her writing is engaging and smart, and I found myself fully captivated by the book. The book is, as the title indicates, primarily about the baby years.  Through an expertly woven set of scenes, the book follows the stages of Druckerman's first born up through age 6. One of her concluding thoughts is this: \\"[French parenting] mostly requires a parent to shift how she conceives of her relationship to her children and what she expects from them.\\"  If you like this book, or are interested in more about her final point, you may want to read David Code's book:[[ASIN:0824525388 To Raise Happy Kids, Put Your Marriage First]]. Code, like Druckerman, lived in France and bases much of his work on the cultural comparisons he gleaned from his time there. (Code also lived in Japan.) Code's book, unlike Druckerman's, focuses on preserving the marriage and is equally applicable to families with older children. I highly recommend both books!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|it's quite boring. I don't get the hype about it. those stupid birds go exactly where I DON'T want them to go. I aim it all right and they just fail. I'm glad this is a free version I wouldn't buy it but some other people might somehow get some fun out of it.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|The Anthrax I've loved since Among the Living is back!! Joey is what made Anthrax stand out for me, and he's back in his full glory. This cd kicks ass from start to finish. I was worried this cd would disappoint....glad I was so wrong!! Hope the guys stay together and keep making more music...so glad to see you back, Joey!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|it's an awesome game. the only thing that I wish could be different is that I could convert money into gems and gems into money without having to buy them.
B000001FSU|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out, and love it just as much today. I would say this is my absolute favorite Anthrax cd, with Spreading the Disease second. It's fun and fast, classic Anthrax!! I also love the social commentary and the dark humor throughout this cd. Forget the negative reviews, this cd is among their best.
B005HSL626|5.0|i've never had a problem with the ads. all I do is turn off wireless Internet and I don't get swarmed with ads at all.people can just avoid it by doing that.
B003R50FRI|5.0|This book is a whopping 900+ page autobiographical saga, but don't let that deter you as it was one of the most enjoyable and fast-paced 900 pages I have ever read.<br />One of the things I loved most about this book is that it gave such an insight in to a side of India that I will probably never see personally, and to be honest, one I never really ever thought I wanted to see. It shows the extremes of the city from the unwavering love and loyalty of the Indian people, to the depth of the corruption and power that ultimately runs the city, as well as showing what life in the slum would be like compared to the rich who live there. If I ever did go to India one day I would be going with my eyes slightly more open to my surroundings than they were previously.<br /><br />The characters were complex and vivid and even the most despicable characters displayed some endearing quality. There were some pretty gruesome parts to this story (at some sections I actually covered by eyes and felt like screaming out!) but for most of the book the characters were smart and lyrical and I enjoyed reading their witty dialogue. Towards the end of the book when the new mafia was coming in to rule, I found the new characters not as agreeable, so am glad he ended the book where he did. Apparently there is a sequel coming but I would hesitate to read it as I had such a good experience with the first book, I would hate for the second one to not live up to the standard and ruin it for me.<br /><br />I was a little thrown with the trip to Afghanistan but also enjoyed reading about another culture that is so foreign to me.<br /><br />It was a long read but one I definitely recommend - definitely the most confronting yet amazing book I have ever read and I would be lucky to find another book I enjoyed as much as this in the next 5-10 years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very good game to kill time or boredom...the games are very entertaining and addicting and some are rather easy and others can be challenging. its a good game for everyone.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Best game Eva but its mean if you say its lame its just super rude to Rovio they put so much effort into the game but also the gravity is the BEST thing! But it is a little short for levels plz make more and this game is rocking!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Sniffle, People call me &quot;Angry Bird&quot; at school......then after I found out that angry Birds Space came out, I WAS THRILLED!!!!

It will make me happy, and a happy customer means a better game, AND MORE PEOPLE WILL DOWNLOAD IT, YOU WILL GET BETTER RATINGS!!!!!!
B000002GKT|5.0|Do You like Peter Frampton? Do you like his \\" Frampton Comes Alive \\"? This Peter Frampton when he was still a teenager, you can hear where he was going to go in his career 4 years before Frampton Comes Alive, which i owned back in the 70's when it came out. Frampton Comes Alive is a very good album, it just unfortunate that radio stations only play the same old songs over and over, alot more songs on that album that shows Mr. Framptons talents than what radio alows you to hear. Back to Humble Pie, Check out Stone Cold Fever or I Don't Need No Doctor, GREAT ROCKIN' but to hear a very young Mr. Frampton's guitar skills listen to all of I Walk On Gilded Splinters, all 22:25 of it!! If you are a Frampton fan you will want to have this album in your collection!!
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|I bought these for my daughters room. They are so vibrant in color and so pretty on the walls. We do have bumpy walls so some of them are coming down a little, that is why 4 stars. They have been up for one day, I may have to try to figure a way to get them to stay up. But they are so pretty and the princess are bigger then I thought. Overall pretty satisfied.
B00005Y46O|5.0|This gives excellent performances of the best of Free, prior to break up and then forming Bad Company. I love to crank up the volume on All Right Now, I'm A Mover, Ride On A Pony, Mr. Big and The Hunter!!! I've owned this album in LP form when it first came out during my High School years and now in the newest CD form I get more songs plus different concerts in one package. If you enjoy Bad Company or like the radio play of Fire & Water you will be pleased with this album.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Madonna's since I first heard Borderline.  I've been with her with her highs, lows, and in-betweens. I have always loved Madonna's voice.  Sure, it's not Celine, Mariah, or Kelly Clarkson strong.  To me, Madonna's voice always has character and truly fits the songs she puts out.  I'm one of her fans that loves maybe 98% of what she puts out musically.  It would take a lot for me NOT to like a song.  Bedtime Stories was the CD that truly challenged me to even like it since I dislike R&B intensely.  However, since it was by Madonna, I gave it a chance and consider it one of her above-average CD's.  That what Madonna does for me, she inspires me to try other genre's of music.  Did I love the folk inthused Music & American Life CD's?  Not on first listen, but I gave them a chance and love them so much now.  Sure, it's not her trademark sound, but that's what makes Madonna so great...so tries different things, usually on her own timetable.<br /><br />I really liked Hard Candy but felt Madonna's voice wasn't showcased to its best ability.  Most of the songs, although good, sounded lifeless and tinny.  I had high hopes for MDNA just based on the CD's name and the cover art.  First single GMAYL was good but Girl Gone Wild is definitely better.  I have just listened to MDNA and truly, I'm feeling so many different emotions right now.  Remember the huge smile Madonna had during her Super Bowl performance?  That's MY smile right now as I type this and listen to the CD AGAIN!  I love, or should I say LUV the 60's/70's vibes going on.  Gang Bang is just what everybody is saying...it alone makes the CD worth buying.  My other favorite tracks include Beautiful Killer, Love Spent, Falling Free, Masterpiece (can't wait till I hear its remixes!), Girl Gone Wild (the video definitely helps me love this song even more!), Turn Up the Radio, and I'm Addicted.  Repeated listens are advised as you'll miss so many aspects to each song the first time.<br /><br />Thank you Madonna for giving us MDNA.  Your truly the Queen and I look forward to you playing these new classics on your tour. I hope the Grammy's pays attention to this CD come awards time...it's truly a Masterpiece....er...sorry.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|--SPOILER ALERT--<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" is the coherent and compelling story of a major pandemic set into America's present-day stupidities of insufficient preparation, anti-intellectual societal climate, and the hundred years of social engineering by corporate greed and political corruption for the sake of the superrich.<br /><br />The storyline provides good emphasis on the reaction, competencies, courage, and human failings of frontline scientists.  Matt Damon's character, Mitch Emhoff, is Mister Ordinary Citizen standing up to the deaths of his wife and stepson at the pandemic's beginning--and protecting his temporarily safe teen-age daughter--with quiet heroism.  Elliot Gould's excellently-played character, Dr. Ian Sussman, ignores and illegally sidesteps an official order to close down his lab, knowing that he has resources that will speed curtailing the pandemic.  He does that and then hands over his results to the proper authorities without any suggestion of profiteering.<br /><br />And there are other breath-taking heroes, along with some dispicable villans.<br /><br />However, the American stupidities are glossed over as if the filmmakers were afraid to talk about the elephants in the living room.  They are glossed over as if these conditions have righteous reasons to exist--as if the American people have done the very best that can be done against a govt that has been rampantly illegitimate since at least 1913.<br /><br />The US govt has been a principal in the manufacturing of corporate greed and political corruption since before the end of WWI, when the monied elites lobbied for the shut-down of the people's direct democracy overhauls of state govts.  It was our \\"Reform Era\\", and it threatened to end superrich domination of the American cash cow.<br /><br />From 1898 to 1918, organized citizens forced direct democracy features into their constitutions to allow the people to deal with govt illegitimacies.  Today, there are 18 states in which the sovereign people have direct control of their now-thoroughly illegitimate govts.  Those direct democracy features are now unused--when they are desperately needed--because of the public's socially-engineered conviction that they would do more harm than good.  So speaketh the superrich.  Corporate greed and political corruption win every day.  The public's mass fascism goes hand-in-glove with govt's mass fascism.  We've been socially engineered into conforming with whatever is best for the superrich and their progeny.  And now we're voting ourselves to death against corruption-aided computers that rob us of fair elections.  (Stop voting, dummies, until justice is done against the illegitimacies.)<br /><br />Our social engineering--directing us away from any rational preparation so that we continue to spend into the already established coffers of the superrich--bit us on the butt badly when Katrina struck New Orleans.  It will bite us badly again when the contagion of the next pandemic hits us (the birds are taking care of weaponizing  bird flu, as a scientist quips in the film, \\"Contagion\\").  And it will bite us badly again when the supervolcano at Yellowstone erupts to fry and and bury a half to three-quarters of the US landmass.  Superrich caretakers Bush and Obama have given us a curtain of controlled media and junk-scientists to pooh-pooh away the now red-zoned, super-sized caldera at Yellowstone.<br /><br />All of the factors to red-zone that supervolcano, to indicate that this one can erupt any day, have demonstrated that they're in place.  But the junk scientists continue to crow that it may be thousands of years before any serious erruption happens.  No worries.  No need for any prepartion whatsoever.<br /><br />If it weren't for the Yellowstone supervolcano's implications of world-wide volcanic winter for 5-10 years--and the major destruction that a volcanic winter can bring to the global food supply--we simply would not have science news from anywhere about what we face when Yellowstone blows up.  As it is, we have Internet web sites that give us access to the science being done in other countries.  And that is in spite of major pooh-poohing of Internet resources being done by global elites and their political dogs.<br /><br />If Yellowstone produces a middling supereruption of middling explosiveness, it's blast-kill zone is projected to be a 600-mile radius.  About 20 million Americans live inside that radius.  Who do we see about their lack of preparation?<br /><br />Our ignorance is bliss for the superrich and their parasitic puppet politicians.  However, as the film, \\"Contagion\\", effectively shows for those with eyes to see, what we don't know can kill us.<br /><br />Did the film show us the fastest way to a pandemic vaccine?  Or did it show us a very slow way along which the superrich can maximize their obscene profits?  Again.<br /><br />If it showed us the way that the superrich get to maximize their obscene profits, then it is just another classical sophistry for the superrich.  Lies bundled in plausible falsehoods so that we don't object too much when they actually drag us through it.<br /><br />There've been a lot of classical sophistries wrapped into popular films lately for the benefit of the superrich.  The ones that jump to mind are \\"Syriana\\" (George Clooney--2005--CYA sophistry for the corporate greed and political corruption corporatism of our nazified govt and big oil); \\"The Dark Knight\\" (Heath Ledger--2008--CYA sophistry for murderous politicians who are the heroes that war-by-deception neocons need); and \\"From Paris With Love\\" (John Travolta--2010--CYA sophistry for CIA evils from kidnapping and rendition to torture and murder because one cowboy kills anybody associated with terrorists who everyone wants dead.  Hip-hip-hooray for the CIA.  Airheads and morons, UNITE.)<br /><br />Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans think that 'sophistry' means what the superrich-controlled, whitewashed dictionaries say it means.  Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans aren't educated enough to know the details of the \\"1st Sophistic\\" and the \\"2nd Sophistic\\", the eras of sophistry centering on the lives of Aristotle and Cicero, respectively.<br /><br />Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans can be persuaded by pooh-poohs and plausible falsehoods to love anything--e.g.,the shredding of the Constitution, the evaporation of the Declaration of Independence, and the vaporizing of every right and liberty fought, bled, and died for by fighting Americans since 1776.  WW2, Korea, Vietnam, and Gulf veterans?  Go play in traffic.<br /><br />In the next pandemic, the superrich's obscene profits won't just cost us the trillions of dollars they ripped out of us in the 2008 financial meltdown.  (Anyone prosecuted for those frauds yet?  In your dreams.)  The next pandemic can easily cost us many tens of millions of human lives.  1918's Spanish flu cost us 50 to 100 million lives globally.  And that was with no jet planes and a global population accustomed to staying at home.<br /><br />The superrich's social engineering is more serious than most imagine.  \\"Contagion\\" shows little bitty reflections of just how seriously we're mired into the stupidities of superrich designs.  And it gives us no discussion of the fastest, most prepared way to develop and administer effective vaccine.<br /><br />We should just openly trust a film, the making of which required tens of millions of dollars?  Where did those millions of dollars come from? Ordinary Americans who are well-informed of vaccine technologies?  In your dreams.<br /><br />--spib, 26 Mar 2012
1400049628|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is an excellent read.  The book was so interesting that I also bought and now reading 'World War Z'.  Which is also very interesting.  Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down and read it in a few hours.
B005FITIDC|1.0|Could have been a good story if you can get around the 40 some f-words plus countless other swearing and a sex scene that did not need to be in the movie (or any movie for that matter). This is the farthest from a Christian movie that you can get. It is fouled up so bad. Maybe they should have gotten Sherwood Baptist to film it. To sum it up....here is a quote from Plugged in Online:<br /><br />Inspiring. Devastating. Heartbreaking. Disturbing. Revelatory. Graphic. Raw. Those are just a few of the words that spring to mind as I ponder how to sum up Machine Gun Preacher, a complex, category-shattering story.<br /><br />On one hand, director Marc Forster (who helmed The Kite Runner, a similarly wrenching film) has served up a spiritually poignant story that evokes comparisons to the kind of movies Sherwood Pictures is making--movies like Courageous and Fireproof that unashamedly preach Jesus and show the difference He makes in someone's life. On the other, this deservedly R-rated film pulls absolutely no punches when it comes to hard-edged content: obscenity, violence, drug abuse and sex. In these areas, Machine Gun Preacher is much more akin to Schindler's List and The Apostle, both tales of similarly broken men desperately trying to find redemption in the midst of trying, sometimes brutal circumstances.<br /><br />Forster says of his protagonist, \\"The fascinating thing about [Sam] is that he is a very flawed character. He has been abusive to himself and to others throughout his life. Those are just facts. At the same time, he has put his life on the line to save hundreds and hundreds of kids. There is this conflict within the character that makes for truly interesting storytelling.\\"<br /><br />\\"The movie definitely was not made for Christian people,\\" Sam told me in a recent phone interview. \\"I should say it was not made for religious people. I feel that every Christian person out there is going to want to hand tickets out. I think it's a great outreach. ... There'sno way you can walk into the theater and walk out of the theater, and not be preached to in this movie. So it's like planting seeds. [The movie] shows a conversion. And it shows it in a raw way that most people in the world and of the world can relate to.\\"<br /><br />He's dead right about one thing: Anyone who watches this movie will be forced to grapple with some pretty significant questions. How do we respond to evil? Can God forgive our most heinous choices? Is violent resistance in defending the innocent ever warranted?<br /><br />But I'll add one more that's harder to answer than it at first seems: Is a violent, drug-addled and profanity-laced R-rated movie required to raise those issues?

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Another amazing season of an amazing show.  Only bad thing about this show (any season) is that it raises your expectations for other shows and they all fall short in comparison.  Flashbacks are well done and for me, this is the first season where you hang on the actions of someone other than Walt MORE (Gus).
B0015DROBO|4.0|It took me three attempts to get past page 50 of this book.  The title character took a long time to appear.  And then when she finally appeared she kept disappearing.  I forced myself to read this book all the way through so that I could converse intelligently with my friends who loved it.  I see how they liked it, and I even see how they loved it.  There's a great mystery and a fantastic character who I want to know more about.  I guess that now I'll have to read the second book in the trilogy to find out about her.  The book could have been tighter if there had been fewer laundry lists of the book titles appearing on different shelves and so on.  I'm frustrated about how long the book was, about now knowing so much about a reporter I could care less about, and about knowing so little about the hacker I want to know about.  This is likely brilliant on the part of the author...<br /><br />JT Kalnay
B0068RHSCW|5.0|If you are a fan of acting- want to see actors who act and not just walk, talk and tell jokes- see this movie.  I won't lie: I think that the editors botched up this movie.  But it is well worth seeing to see their performances.  Naomi Watts is always excellent in horror movies- and she excels in this movie too.  And Daniel Craig never mails in a performance.  One day this could be another \\"Layer Cake\\" like favorite.
0545265355|5.0|I am certainly not a young adult reader~~~~I am a grandmother.  My granddaughter told me I should read this trilogy as they are amazing.  I wanted to purchase them before the movie came out so I could know the story.  I really enjoyed them.<br />I am so glad the young people have characters to relate to or hate or to be sad about and hunger for more.  It is a good thing.  Loaned them to another grandmother whose two granddaughters are also fans of The Hunger Games and her 13 year old said that is so cool that she is reading them and if there is anything she doesn't understand, just call her and she will explain it.  Also told her when she sees her she will go to the movie with her to see it again.  Thought this was cute.  I am sure I will see the movie with my granddaughter when I see her as well.<br />So glad I purchased the books from Amazon.
145162445X|1.0|As a physicist, I have been familiar with Krauss' work and even talked to him on occasion (though I doubt he'd remember me).  Though Krauss has done good work in his career, I have to agree completely with New York Times book reviewer, David Albert.  Albert gives the most scathing review I've ever read in the NYTimes, and I must recommend his article to anyone interested in learning the details of where Krauss goes wrong (a simple google search should yield the review).<br /><br />For a number of years now, Krauss has, for whatever reason, been compelled to use scientific ideas and terminology to aggressively reach beyond science and advance an atheistic agenda.  This book is a culmination of those efforts.  Though there is much true science to be found within the book, the consistent overreaching amounts to the very definition of pseudoscience, and ultimately undermines Krauss' credibility on all levels.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I love this show! It's original, funny, clever, and it never gets old. The cast works great together and the writing is fantastic. Watch it - you'll be hooked.
B004LROMQG|5.0|A couple of years ago I got Merlin seasons one & two from the library to watch with my boys (now 13 year old).  We quickly became addicted!  It is a great story based on the legends of King Arthur but a totally different and original retelling (it is a legend after all).  In particular Merlin (Colin Morgan) and Arthur (Bradley James) are perfectly cast as are Gaius (Richard Wilson) and Anthony Head (Uther) and indeed all of the other main characters are great along with the special guest actors.  Before season one was over I decided we had to own this compelling series so we could watch it again (and we have).  I ordered them from Amazon and as always the service was excellent.  I used to tell my boys if they got their homework done right away we would have time for an episode of Merlin - it always worked but it was hard to stop watching after just one episode! I loved it as much as the boys did and looked forward to that special time with the boys.  I told my 20 year old daughter about it and she loved it too (and several of her college friends are now watching it).  On Christmas day the 4 of us huddled around my computer and watched the final episode of season 4 online with much excitement and we are eagerly awaiting season 5 which is being filmed right now. Each season gets better as the characters grow and develop, the story gets more intense and the anticipation increases.  It goes without saying that I intend to buy seasons 4 & 5 once they become available on dvd in the US; there are special features in each dvd set which are very interesting and entertaining viewing.  I am from the Uk and know season 4 is already available there but it will not play on our US dvd player being a different format.  I have told several friends about Merlin as it has not had the publicity it deserves in the States (we just found it by chance) - it is a great pity as it is far superior to so many of the tv shows/movies which are suitable for family viewing and it entertains all age groups.  It is a shame that lots of people will miss out on seeing Merlin. We particularly love Colin Morgan and Bradley James and how the relationships have evolved between Merlin/Arthur and Merlin/Gaius. During our visit to the Uk this summer we will be going to the Merlin exhibit at Warwick Castle and we'll get our photo taken with the wax figure of Merlin!! I would describe Merlin as a fantasy adventure which is full of excitement and magic, intrigue, tons of wonderful humour (British spelling!!, magical creatures (which are created by the same guys who worked on Harry Potter) and some very emotional moments too.  As Arthur says in Season one (episode one) \\"There's something about you Merlin\\" - that really sums it up! There is something truly special about this series - it has captured our hearts!  The soundtrack cd's are excellent too!  Well done to the BBC and thank you for adding season 5 (I read that only 4 seasons were planned but due to its immense popularity they added another season).  It will be hard when it is over - like the sad (but satisfied) feeling you get when you finish a great book!  Note: I just want to add how much I dislike those reviewers who insist on telling the whole plot - it just spoils it for those who have yet to enjoy this great program<br />Chris Burroughs<br />Denver, Colorado
B00756GKBA|5.0|A dark masterpiece of an album.  It is a VERY dark album of awesome pop music......a horror album even.  \\"Turn up the radio\\" is reminisent of Holiday and \\"girl gone wild\\" is just incredible.  I cant imagine any of the singles charting on the pop chart but they will on the dance chart.  Thats okay though.  This is probably one of her best albums if not THE best Madonna album within the past 20 years.

B007BVOF8E|1.0|The only good thing about this waste of celluloid is that it may stimulate interest in the excellent book and TV series -- the novel by John le Carre, volume one of his Search for Karla trilogy, and the BBC 6-hour miniseries starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.  In fact, if you haven't already encountered those predecessors, your chances of making heads or tails of this new effort are slim.<br /><br />Other reviewers have covered the stone-faced acting of Gary Oldman, the confusing, non-responsive passages of dialog, and the dark, completely uninteresting sets and cinematography.  But the thing that wrecks this movie for me is the loss of any sense of the original story.<br /><br />The novel is a wonderful progression of character and plot that reminds me of Charles Dickens or Jane Austen.  In the book, and the BBC series, the main character arcs -- Jim Prideaux, George Smiley, Peter Guillam, Ricky Tarr -- are mixed with explorations of the supporting actors -- Percy Alleline, Toby Esterhase, Roy Bland, Bill Haydon, Connie Sachs, Jim Roach, Roddy Martindale, Oliver Lacon, Sam Collins, Russian master spy Karla/Guestmann, and especially Jerry Westerby, who becomes the hero of The Honorable Schoolboy, book two of the trilogy -- in a way that leads the reader inexorably to the uncovering of the mole.<br /><br />In the movie there is none of this depth and certainly no enjoyment.  In fact, it's as if the writers sought at every pass to remove elements that reveal the characters and their relationships.  Other reviewers blame the compression into a 2-hour movie, but that just doesn't explain it.  For instance, watching the movie only, you would never guess that Guillam is Smiley's old friend, the person he sought as a drinking companion after being dismissed as assistant head of MI6.  In the car on the way to see Lacon Peter addresses him as Mr. Smiley instead of George.  That was the first discordant note for me.  There were many, many others.<br /><br />Other strikes against the movie include:<br /><br />* Horrible, horrible casting.  While these are obviously professional actors and carry off their roles as written, compare the wonderful casting choices in the BBC series -- tough-guy Ian Bannen as Jim Prideaux, masculine-cum-sardonic Michael Jayston as Peter Guillam, Ian Richardson as supercilious, upper-crust Bill Haydon, the wonderful character actor Joss Ackland as Jerry Westerby.  And of course Alec Guinness, the most gifted actor of all time, as Smiley.<br /><br />* Unnecessary changes to the story line that add nothing, make no sense, and are ineptly done.  Perhaps combining Sam Collins with Jerry Westerby saved time, but then why dress Jerry up in a tuxedo, the way Sam would have been as ex-spy-turned-casino manager?  Never explained.  Why the shooting of Irina in front of Jim Prideaux while a prisoner in the Soviet Union?  They were completely separated in both plot and time.  Jim must have been as confused as I was.<br /><br />* Gary Oldman's portrayal of Smiley.  From movies like Dracula and The Professional we know Oldman is amazing, almost always worth watching.  Here he seems clueless as to his chosen craft.  Smiley, as written and as portrayed by Alec Guinness, was quiet, but commanding and incisive when he spoke, a pivotal character.  Oldman is just silent.<br /><br />* The complete waste of John Hurt as Control -- compare Alexander Knox in the BBC series.<br /><br />* Peter Guillam breaking up with his gay lover -- in the book he is ostentatiously heterosexual.  An obligatory nod to Hollywood's politically correct gay agenda?<br /><br />* Clumsily written scenes -- for example, Alleline's confrontation with Guillam over Tarr's reappearance in England.  Watch the BBC version to see the right way to do this, with little extra investment in time expended.<br /><br />* Poor choice of music, especially at the end.  Bewildering, in fact.<br /><br />* The MI6 office Christmas party.  Nothing remotely like that in thebook.  And why, why, why have Santa Claus in a Lenin mask and everyone happily singing along with the USSR national anthem?  Why??<br /><br />* The Americanization of the dialog by removing le Carre's use of British idiom.  If we Americans really don't know that \\"sacked\\" means fired, are we incapable of figuring it out?<br /><br />* Addition of gratuitous profanity -- the s-word instead of \\"chickenfeed\\" when describing the Witchcraft intelligence material that bamboozled MI6.  Connie Sachs's use of the f-word.  Not in the book and totally unnecessary.  Possibly to gain a PG-13 rating?<br /><br />* Gratuitous violence -- the shooting of Irina, Jim Prideaux using a sniper rifle instead of a karate chop at the end.  I guess American audiences just won't accept a spy movie without gunplay and gore.  I blame Sean Connery and Jason Bourne.<br /><br />(One note of praise:  At least here MI6 has a decent-sized building.  The BBC production gave the impression they were in rented offices over a failing London bookshop.)<br /><br />As this project proceeded, someone must have seen the disaster it was headed for.  I'm surprised le Carre allowed his name to be associated with the final product.  Was there a mole in the production company?<br /><br />So, read the book and watch the TV series.  If those make you a Karla fanatic the way I am, then you may want to watch this hideously deformed descendant just for closure.  Otherwise, I suggest you skip it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the Hunger Games in 2008, right when it came out. And lets just say it simply changed my life. I keep rereading every book in the series. Its an incredible action and adventure novel with a twist on each page. It also has the perfect amount of romance on the side. Its unlike any book you'll read. And I promise anyone will absolutely fall in love with the plot, storyline, and characters.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|I purchased the Alien Anthology import version (UK) which is about $30.00 less than the US version. This is the only difference between the two versions...the price. Everything else is EXACTLY the same. UK blu-ray version is region free so it will run perfectly on any US blu ray player provided that you update the firmware of your player, and that it has a memory storage. I have a dedicated blu ray player (not a PS3) with a USB slot. When I first launched Alien Anthology, it asked for a 1MB storage. I used my flash drive and inserted it in the USB...voila! The 1MB storage requirement is for the special features built into the movies... I think.<br /><br />So far, I've watched Alien 2, 3 ,4 in this box set. The Anthology has two versions of the movie on each disc- Original Release and 2003 Release. I watched the 2003 release for 2,3,4. I was not disappointed. I have all four DVD versions that I bought many years ago and you can see the huge difference on blu ray. Alien 2 still has a few grainy scenes but not as bad as the DVD version. You can now see details of the Colonial Marine uniforms, the pulse rifle, the Queen Alien, all in spectacular detail. Alien 2 sound has been revamped as well. It's louder, earth shaking rumble.<br /><br />Alien 3 so far has the best quality remastering than 2 and 4. Also, the 2003 version of Alien 3 added TONS of additional scenes, and removed a few. Everything looked so crystal clear and crisp. Sound was overhauled completely.<br /><br />Alien 4 also looked spectacular. The story was ok. All the technology and remastering couldn't save the movie from Winona Ryder's acting so you'll just have to contend with her. Haha! Still, it's a good Aliens movie.<br /><br />I have not seen Alien 1 in this box set. I am reserving this for this weekend. Also I have not tried the special features called MU-TH-UR mode. I'm still not clear as to how this works. Right now, I am just enjoying the movies without playing around with the special features.<br/><br />Overall, this is probably one of the best anthology packages ever assembled. 20th Century Fox really did their job well here. TONS of commentaries, behind the scenes footages, everything a fan wants to know about Aliens.  I highly recommend this box set. It's a major revamp of the entire Aliens anthology. You will be surprised at the quality of the picture and sound on blu ray. It's FANTASTIC! Please please get it. :)
B003XDVVO0|4.0|These are comfortable shoes and I like them for the most part.  However, my one complaint is that the heel strap is a little tight and it forces my toes into the front of the shoe even though the footbed is plenty long enough.  I'm hoping that as I wear them the strap will stretch a little.
1449305172|3.0|Ash Maurya describes his book as follows:<br /><br />«Running Lean is a handbook for practicing entrepreneurs who want to increase their odds of success.»<br /><br />Which, for me, was originally off-putting. Why? When I was reading the blurb, I focused in on the words \\"innovate\\" and \\"iterate\\" and blocked out \\"venture\\" and \\"bootstrapping\\". I came at this book as an engineer, not as an entrepreneur. And my initial enthusiasm quickly waned: is this going to be one of those self-important business books? But pretty quickly, I figured out that it was not; Maurya was about to lay out a plan for (in essence) applying the scientific method to your business plan.<br /><br />Again, as an engineer by trade, I caught myself thinking: this is not what I came here for, I came here for ideas about effective agile development. That's in there, but it's just one of the many lessons that is embedded in Running Lean. Maurya writes lucidly about how to take your product/business idea and shape it; about how to organize your team to focus on The Problem and The Solution; about how to reach out to customers and interview them, to help them help you define the problem space; about how to pull out real information from those interviews and test releases, and learn real lessons instead of just confirming how great you think you are. The lessons of Running Lean help you to create a real solution for a real problem, and not just be a clever solution looking for the right problem.<br /><br />But what about us engineers? What about folks like me that were looking for strategies on development iteration? Those lessons are in there, too -- if you can get past the entrepreneurese and pay attention to the content.<br /><br />There's a quote in there:<br /><br />«Not only does this approach delay validation of one of the riskier parts of the model (because it's too easy for a user to say yes), but a lack of strong customer \\"commitment\\" can also be detrimental to optimal learning.»<br /><br />And it made me think of a recent post by Gus Mueller (of Flying Meat Software). In that post, Mueller talks about what his historical pricing model has been for VoodooPad (one of his flagship products), and in particular what the pricing model has been for folks on an upgrade path; and then he goes on to talk about how the Mac App Store has disrupted that. In discussing all of this, he breaks down a number of different approaches he could take in the face of this new reality for his business. He is concerned about price, and naturally he is concerned about product quality; but he is also concerned about the relationships that his customers build with his products. Mueller writes:<br /><br />«I can already hear someone saying \\"just charge less and you'll get four times as many customers- which is twice as much money!\\". This will also multiply the support burden (and probably by more than 2x). Lower price means more people will buy a product on a whim. I'd rather have fewer customers that have done the research, compared multiple products, and is willing to pay a higher price for a product that fits their needs.»<br /><br />Fewer but more committed customers. Customers that have done the research. Customers that have decided that this is a product that solves (in a very real way) a very real problem for them. This sentiment dovetailed with Maurya's lessons from Running Lean, and it resonated with me in a big and very important way. In a way, this is exactly the sort of thing that Maurya is writing about -- about not chasing \\"vanity metrics\\" like hits or downloads or installs or sign-ups, but instead focusing on asking hard questions and finding real answers, and ultimately building real solutions for real problems for real people. But make no mistake, what Maurya posits is no easy task -- it requires discipline, and there is a sanguine optimism that underlies his implicit assumption that you can do it.d it made me think of a recent post by Gus Mueller (of Flying Meat Software).

0066620996|4.0|Written by famed business consultant, Jim Collins, Good to Great is a book that analyses how a good company can transition into a company that has sustained growth and results.  Unlike Collins' first book, Built to Last, the companies that Collins and his team delved into were not great companies that continued their successes.  Instead, the organizations that were considered were those that were milling along, had a transitional phase or event, and then from there became \\"great\\" companies.  Among those that were analyzed were not only specific organizations but also their competitors to determine what they had done differently to set themselves apart from the industry.<br /> Collins enjoys using metaphors to better relate the point he is attempting to get across to his reader.  The Flywheel is a recurring theme that allows the reader to understand the plight of a company that is attempting to transition from good to great.  The flywheel shows that companies must continuously push forward through the good and bad, the ups and downs and periods of uncertainty and struggles.  Ultimately, great companies, according to Collins' research, show that there are three stages of development which include the company's people, thoughts and actions.<br /> The people that Collins' speaks about revolved around the idea of leadership.  Specifically, that companies who were good and became great had one thing in common, a level five leader.  In contrast to other levels, level five leadership is the culmination of all subsequent stages.  It goes well beyond the productive contributions and achievement of group objectives of a highly capable employee (level one) and team member (level two).  Furthermore, the level five executive expands upon efficiently organizing capital and creating a vision in pursuit of attaining goals and stimulating high performance, the major roles of a competent manger (level three) and effective leader (level four), respectively.  Conversely, level five leadership encompasses all of these characteristics, as well as undeniable humility and resolve that can neither be measured nor simply acquired.  Level five leaders are one of the main driving forces behind good companies becoming great ones.<br /> One aspect of Collins' book that was especially interesting, and one of my favorite parts, was the idea that level five leaders not only focus on the company and its products but much of the success they envision is because of those who surround them.  Level five leaders do not simply have yes-men.  A concept that Collins' stresses for a successful company is the idea of \\"first who, then what.\\"  Another apropos metaphor that Collins' utilizes is that of a school bus.  It is important for an organization to not only get the right people on the bus but also to let the wrong people off the bus.  If everyone is not \\"driving\\" in the same direction, the overall effort will be stymied.  Collins goes one step further in his metaphor and that is it simply isn't enough to have the right people on the bus.  If they are sitting in the wrong seat, they are as useless as those whom they just replaced.  Again, it comes down to a level five leader knowing what has to be done and assigning the right people to do the job at hand.<br /> Another topic that Collins and his team discuss is that of a Hedgehog Concept.  The Hedgehog Concept is the fundamental comparison between a hedgehog and a fox.  While the fox is smooth, cunning, and crafty it is always attempting to outsmart its prey, while never truly mastering a single procedure or method.  This was something the comparison companies did all too often in their pursuit to become great.  However, the companies who actually did take the next step to greatness were more similar to that of the hedgehog, which follows what it knows best being its one simplistic and instinctive instrument to its survival.  The comparison companies constantly tried to pull the wool over the eyes of its customers and, even at times, its employees, while the hedgehog, the great companies, stuck to what made them good companies to being with.  They did not cut corners to get to the Promised Land, something that a level five leader would not allow.<br /> A final aspect that Good to Great touches upon is that of disciplined action.  Technology is an important aspect that many companies use in their quest from mediocre to good and good to great.  Organizations that desire to be the best they can be foster a place of innovation, creativity and ingenuity.  Without supporting those aspects it will be very difficult for a company to transition to great.  In a forever changing world it is necessary to have a constantly changing and developing organization.  A company that rests on its pasts and its laurels is sure to rest where it is and not improve its standing.  Nonetheless, using too much technology and becoming reliant on it to drive a corporation's growth can be equally as stifling.  By following an established strategy, technology and its uses can help further the ideologies and hedgehog concepts of a company instead of being the company.  Technology is simply a support function for greatness, not the source of it.  The source of greatness is having level five leaders push the flywheel through the hedgehog concepts.  Collins stresses that each dimensions relies on the other and greatness cannot be achieved by having only two of the three dynamics.  It is a collaborative effort that everyone must be involved in.  By having one person, either in the wrong seat, on the wrong bus, using fox techniques, or attempting to use an over reliance on technology to take the next step can stymie an organization's growth opportunities and their ability to step up from good to great.<br /> One aspect of Collins' book that I tend to criticize is that of the Hedgehog Concept as, in many institutions of higher education, it is taught that the best way to minimize risk is to diversify and not put allthe eggs in one's proverbial basket.  In the event of a failure, the Hedgehog Concept theory would limit the ability of a corporation to divest itself of its losses and prepare for a slowdown of growth.  One other aspect that was not particularly enjoying about Good to Great was the multitude of story lines that kept on arising as the pages turned.  In an effort to give the reader a better understanding of how upper management functions it became confusing keeping track of which CEO belonged to which company and what the past history of the CEO was.  If one is not familiar with all the names that make up an organization's rankings it can become perplexing trying to figure out who was with what and when and why...in the living room!  A murder mystery of sorts!<br /> In the end, most of the companies that were featured in Good to Great are still in business and doing well for themselves.  The fact that every company did not stand the test of time, especially during a recession unseen in 30 years, does not affect the assumptions in the book.  If a corporation possesses level five leadership and personnel, then there is a favorable chance for success.  Even today, the theories and ideas in the book still apply to nearly any business as technology continues to progress more rapidly now more than ever.  What makes this book outstanding is that Good to Great is not just a practical business application.  Its principles can be practiced by all sorts of different people, regardless of background.  Not only does it reveal how to transition an organization from good to great, but also how to lead a great life.  Every day, we are surrounded by opportunities, and the difficulty is often realizing not what but how, not when but who, and most importantly, not what is the answer, but what is the question.  Only then can one learn how to progress from good to great.

0553582038|1.0|I purchased the first 4 books of this series for my kindle.  Other than the layout of the intros, outros and appendix between books (a little editing putting everything at the end would have been nice) The first three books are some of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />A feast of crows has me waiting on hearing about the characters I really care about and never gets around to moving their stories forward.  The first three books were so good I made it almost all the way through this 4th one but I am giving up in disgust.  The characters I care about - Bran, Jon Snow, Davos, Tyrion and the Starks are barely touched on in this book.  I have been waiting to see what the hell is going on in the North but here is a spoiler for you- A feast of crows won't give you those answers.  Read the first three books and pretend this one doesn't exist or as another reviewer put it - just read the wikipedia entry- you will be much happier.<br /><br />It reminds me of the experience of reading the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings and then getting excited about the Silmarillion only to have it be an endless list of names of people I didn't care about.

B003UYUP58|5.0|It´s incredible how the author knits history of mankind with the evolution of cancer and the search for cancer \\"cure\\". It has helped me connect what is usually being taught in Medical School with the actual people-researchers who have had the guts to think differently in order to tackle cancer. I can observe how a big discovery (one that might consume the whole thinking life-span of a person) becomes only  a little step in understanding cancer. I will recommend this book to 6th and 7 th year medical students here in Guatemala City.

I immediately purchased three, one of which was The Preacher's Wife movie soundtrack.  I love it, and I've been listening to all three ever since.  I liked them so much that when the new email came out offering a few more of her CDs I couldn't resist purchasing another 3pack.  I'm totally happy with my purchase and will continue to look forward to Amazon's great deals on music CDs.  Thanks.<br /><br />Jojo

0205313426|3.0|I know this book has its devoted followers who swear it's essential for the act of writing but to me it feels like an ad hoc collection of do's and don'ts which may help you polish up a few details of your writing but won't teach you the basics of how to write clearly.  There may be some useful substance in there somewhere, but I don't find the presentation to be very engaging and I've found other, more recent books that, for me, are better: for instance, \\"Style\\" by Williams and \\"Rhetorical Grammar\\" by Kolln.  These books are influenced by currents in linguisitcs developed since Strunk and White, they center on the idea that \\"norms\\" can vary based on functional needs, and they promote analysis and exercise of judgment rather than sweeping, universal stylistic rules.<br /><br />Strunk and White may have some value as a reference tool in the editing process, it doesn't cost much, and it certainly won't do you any harm, so you might as well buy it; but it doesn't strike me as indispensible.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|I bought this processor a couple months ago for my PC and it is absolutely great! (I actually got a deal on it from microcenter when it was paired with a z68 motherboard so if that's still going on I would check it out. sorry amazon) It has been reliable so far and incredibly speedy. I have yet to come up to something it can't handle and I haven't even bothered overclocking it yet. Which brings up a decent point. You should definitely be sure you will utilize the overclocking capabilities before buying the K. I don't regret it, because I know down the road I'll use it, but for some people it might not be worth the extra money.<br /><br />With that said, this is a great processor from intel and I would definitely recommend it for new PC builds.

B006Z2WE0G|5.0|It was wonderfully descriptive and very well written.  And that made this book difficult to read.  Sarah's Key portrays fictional characters caught up in the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in Paris on July 16 and 17, 1942 so well that I feel like I know them.  I can see them in my mind.  It was a moving story which brought me to tears more than once.  I've been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, have Jewish family and I know much about The Shoah.

0439023513|3.0|Spoilers below...<br /><br />I just finished breathlessly finishing the trilogy last night after consecutively reading all 3 books back to back over the span of a few days. All three books were fantastic page turners with rich character development, tremendous imagery, wit, humor, and adventure.<br /><br />However, after finishing the Mockingjay late last night I actually found myself angry at how the story ends and at the author - not for the content, but with the way in which it was treated. After spending all that time really getting to know and develop feelings for the characters, the last 20 pages or so just feels too rushed and artificial.<br /><br />Although there are a few minor nit-picky things throughout, there are two things in particular in the ending that I do not understand and that I feel are not well treated by the author:<br /><br />1) Why did Katniss vote \\"Yes\\" to have a final Hunger Games? Yes, the pain of Prim's death is understandable, but this is completely out of her character based on her past words and deeds and comes as a complete shock. What is the point of this? To show how low she has sunk due to the effects of battle and emptiness? To put her into sharper contrast with Peeta's humanity who instantly rejects the idea? To simply make the upcoming death of Coin more unexpected?  Worst of all, there is no mention that after the vote and Coin's death that this final Games is not going to happen. Afterall, the victors did vote for it, right? I don't get it. Maybe someone can help me out here.<br /><br />2) This is the biggest one for me: I do not understand why Katniss ends up with Peeta. The worst part is that after all the love turmoil throughout the whole trilogy, she isn't even the one who makes the final decision. The boys do. Peeta basically shows up (apparantly as soon as the Dr. allowed him) but Gale simply doesn't come back, accepting a \\"fancy job\\" in District 2? Uhhh... what? I get the author's attempt to say that Katniss needed thewarmth and eternal optimism of Peeta to find peace, but I cannot forgive the author for simply allowing Gale to never come back or say anything. This is completely out of his character. Worst of all you get the sense that in her heart Katniss deep down still wants Gale although she is willing to accept Peeta. Even after Peeta had shown up. When she went out to the woods and sat on their meeting rock, if Gale had shown up (as she kept wishing he would) saying, \\"Hey, Catnip\\" or something, I'm left feeling she would have run off with him in a heartbeat. Perhaps in Gale's final conversation with Katniss where she connects him to Prim's death, he feels that she will truly never accept him now and he leaves to save himself the anguish of trying to love this now broken, cold woman, finally deciding he must move on. But at the time of the conversation Katniss herself already knows it wasn't his fault and wants to forgive him, she just can't right then. We'll just never know. I'm left feeling that Katniss has \\"settled\\" with Peeta simply because Gale didn't bother coming back. And for this I am left feeling unhappy for all three characters. Maybe this was the point, but I don't know why.<br /><br />I'm fine with unhappy endings, but to not tell why Gale chooses to not come back or fully explain his reasons is almost unforgiveable as their unresolved love is one of the most important themes in the series. And then to include an epilogue that makes it clear that Gale never comes back even denies me the freedom to envision other eventual final endings in my own head. It is easy to come up with \\"shock\\" endings, but the way this one ends just feels ... sloppy. And after spending all that time connecting with the characters, I feel a little cheated and empty.

The inability to reason beyond the senses.<br /><br />He cannot use his reason beyond what he can see, feel, touch and smell, so his mind is closed to the whole of reality.<br /><br />He has closed his mind to its ultimate goal: \\"This is the earthly goal of man: to evolve his intellectual powers to their fullest - ,to arrive at the maximum of conscioisness; to open the deyes of his understanding upon all thinga, so that upon the tablet of his mind, the order of the whole universe and all its parts may be enrolled.\\"<br /><br />He is imprisoned in his own psyche - that is the very nature of Atheism - complete subjectivity.<br /><br />He is not as scientific as he pretends, because he cannot go where the senses leave off , and reason takes over.<br /><br />\\"Our intellect in knowing is extended to infinity.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am about to complete the fifth and final book in the Game of Thrones series and I will be sad to say goodbye to all the characters and the Seven Kingdoms. George RR Martin is the master storyteller. His grasp of the characters and the entire fabric of the world which he invented, is so rich and complex, you almost feel like you are catching up with old friends, not fictional characters. The author is a genius, and he a has a wickedly funny sense of humor that he weaves throughout the story.
1410430103|5.0|First I must say that I'd liked this book very very much. I even read it twice.... but.... An important part of the intrigue deals with the reversal of the U.S. motto \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" which means as everyone knows \\"Out of many, one\\". Joe Reacher reverses this motto and makes it \\"E Unum Pluribus\\" wanting it to mean \\"Out of one, many\\". However Joe's knowledge of the latin language seems to be not very deep since he does not know that latin is a declinable language and that the words are modified depending of their functions in the sentences. In effect \\"Out of one, many\\" translated in latin becomes \\"E Uno Plures\\" that is quite different of \\"E Unum Pluribus\\". I doubt that if Jack Reacher had found the word \\"Plures\\" instead of \\"Pluribus\\" he would have deduced that his brother was reversing the U.S. motto.<br /><br />Nevertheless suppose a person makes a mistake without knowing it is a mistake and suppose also that absolutely nobody afterwards realizes that the first person made a mistake, then is it really a mistake ??? That seems to be the case in this book.

B0009SOFFY|5.0|there's not much i could say that would add to the reviews thus far.  upon seeing them live, producer don galluci (who played organ on the infamous \\"louie, louie\\") told then elektra head jack holtzman that the stooges music could not be captured in a studio setting, but he was wrong about that. his approach - to record the band live (iggy's vocals as well - he sang through a PA and the monitors were mic'd), and the album was recorded in sequence, song-by-song.  the results speak for themselves.  IMO, this is one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever made, right up there with iggy and the stooges \\"raw power\\" (i still can't decide which one i like better). to top it off, the raw power-era band wrote and demoed enough songs to put out another amazing recored (if you haven't heard these songs, i suggest picking up \\"more power\\" and/or as many of the releases out there containing various takes of these demos). the real gems from these demos include the following:<br /><br />she creatures of the hollywood hills<br />johanna<br />open up and bleed<br />i got a right<br />gimme some skin<br />'till the end of the night<br />scene of the crime<br />wild love<br />head on<br />...<br /><br />enough cannot be said about the importance of this band. there was truly a method to iggy's madness, which is indicative of a genius that is sorely lacking in the vast numbers of iggy wanna-be's.<br /><br />this is the real deal.  pick it up - it's a great place to start.  you will be glad you did as it put's everything that followed in perspective.  this band truly changed the landscape of music.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the first Wool book because I was looking for a bargain to read on my Kindle.  I don't usually go in for short stories, but I tried the sample and decided it was certainly worth a go.  I finished the original Wool very quickly and had to decide if I was going to buy the next one or not.  Instead of buying just one, I opted for the omnibus edition and I'm glad I did!  Each Wool is a perfect progression from the one before and the final book is novel-length.  I devoured all five in less than a week and couldn't stop telling friends about the books.  I finished them about a month ago and I'd still like to have more of them.<br /><br />I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy, though I wouldn't consider myself hardcore into the genre.  What I really appreciate is excellent story telling, and all of the Wool books have that in spades.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Bringing in their fourth studio album, Amaryllis doesn't disappoint!  While I'm not your standard music reviewer, I did want to put a review up for those who are debating getting this album.<br /><br />While not as strong or hard hitting as their last \\"Sound of Madness\\" album, it still contains strong musical rhythms, hard guitar rips, and great vocals.  The lyrics for this album also seemed to have a bit more thought than their last few, which gives their overall feel a bit more depth, which is something I definitely appreciate in the music industry today.<br /><br />All in all, Shinedown continues to show their musical strength and deserving right in the history as a great band.  If you've liked their previous work, this album won't through you any surprises.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like good harder rock that isn't pushing the borders of metal or screaming obscenities into your eardrums, then Shinedown is a great band to pick up and this album can be a great start.  At the end, I highly recommend the album.<br /><br />Keep it coming Shinedown!
0545405777|5.0|I first noticed this book when I saw many students (primarily Middle School) reading this book as part of their class assignment.  Similar to reading the Harry Potter series, they seem to enjoy the story and discuss the book passionately.  That is one aspect of the book that I noticed: it engages discussion.<br /><br />After reading the book, it reminds me of a futuristic version of \\"Survivor\\" with the losers being permanently sent \\"home\\".<br /><br />I look forward to reading the next two books in the series.  As an author, I want to learn and use different writing styles and techniques.  Similar to John Grisham, the author of the book, \\"The Hunger Games\\", knows and understands how to keep the reader in suspense.  Also, her chapters are about 10 pages long which make reading and understanding this book a simple task.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"

B003EYVXV4|5.0|Many of the extremely successful movie franchises have ended or are close to conclude.  Harry Potter just recently ended as the most successful movie franchise in history.  The Twilight series will be concluding this November 2012.  Now, the new blockbuster movie series starts of with the movie, \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />The movie stays true to most of the theme and story from the book. More importantly, the \\"Hunger Games\\" is thought-provoking and entertaining.  It is rare for a movie to be both entertaining and informative.  Most movies especially those aimed at a younger audience are mainly entertaining.<br /><br />This movie will appeal even to older audiences.  It is packed with action, romance, drama, and science-fiction.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
030726999X|5.0|The sad thing about reading this series is knowing that with each book, Mr. Larsson improved upon his writing, yet he is no longer with us to give us more.  Each of the books in this series get progressively better.  This is an entire story in 3 acts.  The action starts just where it left off in the previous entry.  Salander is in the hospital recovering from her head wound.  How will she defend herself?  How will she be able to communicate with the outside world.<br /><br />Mr. Larsson gets creative and gives us some wonderful plot twists and turns as Salander breaks through the technological barriers and then faces her nemesis's one by one.  The pace of the story and the surprises make for exciting reading.  This is a long book, but I read it fast due to the non-stop action.<br /><br />In this book, you finally get resolution to outstanding issues, you learn the rest of Salander's breakground and why she turned out as she did.  Not the best of family situations!  I enjoyed this book as much or more than the previous two.  A great mystery / thriller.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o fast-paced - makes long novel a quick read<br />o plot lines are finished - secrets revealed<br />o excellent use of seemingly realistic technology<br /><br />Cons;<br />o slightly over-the-top - much like the first two<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this series and especially the final volume to anyone who enjoys mystery / thrillers.

B005OTGS4E|4.0|I saw a clip of this movie at a vendors stand at a militaria show and was curious about it and later got it. It reminds me of a WWII movie you would see in the 1960's but a little more fact based and there is no slowdown in the story with romance. The acting was good as was the action scenes but there are never enough action scenes for me. There were a few small issues with some of the uniforms and equipment for the historian types but nothing blatant, I watch these types for movies for the story not what type of holster or sling the characters use. If you liked \\" Where Eagles Dare\\" you would probably like this movie. Keep in mind that the good guys prevail but they pay a heavy price and not all of them make it back like they did in the 1960's movies.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Now, just a few years ago, the world was taken by storm by the Swedish-language film adaptation of this incredibly successful book (which I have not read yet), and the world was taken similarly by storm by Noomi Rapace, playing the intense, fierce and wholly independent Lisbeth Salander. It's a good film with a great performance by Rapace, and that has translated to high profile roles in English-Speaking cinema now, with a major role in the most recent SHERLOCK HOLMES film and the main character in this summer's upcoming PROMETHEUS.<br /><br />Now, aside from a few films (PANIC ROOM and THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON), David Fincher has always hit the mark (SE7EN, THE GAME, THE SOCIAL NETWORK, FIGHT CLUB), or came as close as he could (ALIEN 3). Like all of his great films, this is a film packed with amazing performances, and like all of his great films, there's one performance that over-shadows all the others, and with this film, it's Rooney Mara, again as Salander. However, the major difference between the Swedish film and the English film (other than the different languages) is the power of the film. Where I was left feeling somewhat empty after viewing the Swedish version, I felt totally fulfilled by Fincher's film, adapted by Steven Zaillian, one of Hollywood's premier wordsmiths, and performed with versatility and power by its cast, again with Mara at the forefront, but other than the rather forgettable supporting performances by the Swedish film's cast, such as Michael Nyquist playing a too-stilted Mikael Blomkvist, here for the part of Blomkvist, we have Daniel Craig, who is a far superior actor to Nyquist, and shows the versatility, charm and intelligence of the role. I feel that Craig was pretty short-changed as far as any of the acclaim of the film is concerned, as was Stellan Skarsgaard, playing Martin Vanger with great skill. Also short-changed is Fincher's skill as a director. While I didn't really care for ALIEN 3 as a whole, I felt that Fincher had an interesting enough vision, and he more than exceeded my expectations for that vision with SE7EN, which is strangely kind of a companion piece to this film. But if anything, Fincher's skill behind the camera has only grown since then, and this film shows him possibly as his height as he manages to make this a whole and complete film that can stand alone, despite the two other parts of Larsson's MILLENIUM trilogy. Hopefully, Sony Pictures will look at the eventual returns of this film that include home video sales and will conclude that Fincher, Mara and Craig should return for the sequels.had an interesting enough vision, and he more than exceeded my expectations for that vision with SE7EN, which is strangely kind of a companion piece to this film.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|Tom Cruise is a great movie star. There. I said it. After some thirty years in this business and about twenty-five of those years spent as a bona-fide star, he can still make it work. No matter what you may think of him personally, there is an effortless charm that he brings to almost all of his films. Lately, though, it's been a bit of a slog. With films like KNIGHT AND DAY, VALKYRIE and LIONS FOR LAMBS (Remember that film? Yeah, me neither), he hasn't been packing them in like he used to. Even M-I:3 was considered something of a failure, despite doing over $350 million worldwide. But that's Hollywood for ya: You jump on Oprah's couch and you claim that psychology is a scam, and people look at you differently, even when you're acting. I've loved Cruise's work for decades (except when he's in REALLY lousy films, like COCKTAIL or THE FIRM or VANILLA SKY), and I've admired him when he took risks (like MAGNOLIA and COLLATERAL, even if I don't care for those films). When I heard that he had gotten Brad Bird, the director of Pixar classics THE INCREDIBLES and RATATOUILLE and my favorite hand-drawn English animated film of all time, THE IRON GIANT, I was VERY excited. This is obviously someone who knows extremely creative storytelling, and really knows how to construct a scene. But it was also his first live-action film. But with Simon Pegg returning, and new additions like Jeremy Renner, Tom Wilkinson, and Josh Holloway (despite the latter two had nothing more than cameos, really), and with working again with J.J. Abrams who helped revitalize the series with the third film, I still had high hopes.<br /><br />Then the reviews started pouring in.<br /><br />WOW. People were LOVING this film. And by all accounts, they were exactly right to. The film is ear-to-ear grinning and wall-to-wall action. Not the pensive De Palma action of the first film, and not John Woo M:I-2 mega-ultra gunplay action, and not uncomfortably realistic J.J. Abrams action; but like a snowball rolling down a hill, once it starts, it just gets bigger and bigger and then you find yourself at the bottom of that hill and you await the bliss of the impact. Bird lays the hyper-dynamic (and dare I say cartoonish) set pieces piled one on top of another like the most delicious action-adventure cake you've tasted in years. The haters can keep hating on Cruise, but he really makes this film pop just as much as Bird does. His breezy wit and afore-mentioned effortless charm flow during some of the film, but he gets down to business in a big way. One complaint I keep seeing of this film is how unrealistic it is. Guess what? IT'S MISSION &#*%^@& IMPOSSIBLE!! If it were MISSION: POSSIBLE, then I could accept that criticism. This is not HILL STREET BLUES; It's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. It's not supposed to be realistic at all times.<br /><br />This is by far the best of the M:I series, and I hope that Bird and Cruise team up again soon, because that would be another mission I would absolutely choose to accept.down a hill, once it starts, it just gets bigger and bigger and then you find yourself at the bottom of that hill and you await the bliss of the impact.

B0034G4P9E|5.0|I really liked Gavin O'Connor's MIRACLE. It was a very good film about a very inspiring story. But the only issue that I really had with that film is that it was a little too reliant on the nostalgia factor to get its point driven home. WARRIOR doesn't suffer from that. This is very much a film set in the here and now, and that gives it more immediacy in regards to the world its set in. Edgerton's character is on the verge of losing his house and the prize money is the only thing that can save it. Hardy (who, along with Michael Fassbender, is one of the hardest-working men in showbiz) is a man with a mission. His mission is very single-minded and anyone in his way is merely an obstacle. But what makes this tale so much more vital and what makes these adversaries so compelling is their famililal bond. When you have a film like this, you generally have a clear hero and a clear villain. Edgerton seems more heroic in his underdog, can-he-or-can't-he tale, and Hardy seems more villainous with his rock-solid body, crushing blows and his anger constantly near his surface.<br /><br />When you cut below the surface and get to their intent, you can see that both of them deserve to win this tournament, and that both of them have similarly honorable reasons for fighting. The great thing about this film is that it never forces you to take sides. You care about both Edgerton and Hardy, and that's a very difficult thing to pull off in a film like this. Nick Nolte, surprisingly to me, was a tiny bit of a weak link in this film, not so much because of his performance, but because his character, the formerly drunk and abusive father and grizzled veteran trainer who, after losing everyone, turns his life around into sobriety and constant apology... the character is far too much of a trope in this genre of films. It was the only part of the film that felt a little false to me.<br /><br />Otherwise though, WARRIOR, with its terrific performances, smart storytelling and its suspeneful atmosphere as it builds towards its inevitable conclusion and the raw emotion and physicality of the final fight just drains you and makes this similar to FIELD OF DREAMS as kind of a \\"chick flick\\" for guys. Yeah, I cried. Wanna make something of it?mosphere as it builds towards its inevitable conclusion and the raw emotion and physicality of the final fight just drains you and makes this similar to FIELD OF DREAMS as kind of a \\"chick flick\\" for guys.

0345529057|2.0|I have been looking for books to read.  I adore a good story and I thought this might be one, but I found them to be very disappointing.  I burned through the first book and then most of the second hoping, hoping, hoping, for something good to happen.  Nothing good happens.  There is my spoiler.  Nothing good happens in these books.  Some characters you like and some you don't, but ultimately nothing good happens.  I don't know that I am willing to spend hour after hour reading thousands of pages (they are long) when nothing good happens to anyone.  I have come to expect misery and death for every character.  This may work for some readers of fantasy fiction.  They like the complexity--and believe me there is enough complexity to satisfy most readers of fiction, and the nuanced characters, no black and white or true good and evil here.  But I need some satisfaction.  If I wanted misery and death all the time I would read about world politics, The Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq.  I have read about 1500 pages into the series, and nothing nice has happened since the first few chapters. The stories are intricate, the writing is compelling, the characters are enjoyably wicked and enjoyably worth rooting for.  But the books are a drag.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|First let me start off by saying that I loved the first book. I couldn't put it down and read it in less than a day. I am now half way through this book and not sure if I can finish it. It's just basically more of book one. There is nothing new at all. She bites her lip and turns Christian on and they have sex 24/7. It's two pages of plot and 10 pages of sex and this goes on through out the whole book. She also seems to have had more of a spine in book one. She now just does whatever he asks as she understands him more now. They are also at a oooey gooeey phase of their relationship where everything they do and say is cute to each other. I can't help but feel like a third wheel on their date. I will finish this book because I bought it but NO WAY am I  paying another 10 bucks for more of the same. Fifty shades of grey could of been a great stand alone book.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Let the Great World Spin is about a cast of characters surrounding the 1974 high-wire walk of Phillipe Petit between the World Trade Center towers in New York City.  There is an entire sequence of events set into place upon the trial of Petit.  The rest I will leave for your reading pleasure.<br /><br />My attention was immediately captured when I started the book.  At some point a few chapters in, I got a bit confused, but stuck with it and everything made sense in the end.  It is a book you really have to pay attention to and take notice of the intricate details.  It is brilliantly and poetically written. Themes of chance and destiny pervade throughout and cause you to continue thinking about it even after you finish the last sentence.  The true hallmark of a good book (or movie), in my opinion, is the aftermath of thought.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great novel with substance.

B007ARJF6G|5.0|Madonna brings us her best album since Ray of Light! The album is a roller coaster ride of emotions. From happy songs to sad songs MDNA takes you on a emotional journey like only Madonna can. For all the doubters that thought Madonna was over (they say it every time she has a new album) you are once again wrong. Madonna is still without a doubt the queen of pop and is bringing something fresh and unique that radio has been missing for years. This is a review of the clean version of MDNA which is missing one of the best songs on the album Gang Bang. I highly recommend the deluxe edition [[ASIN:B00756GKBA MDNA]] and explicit version above this because it has some amazing songs.<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild - This is the second single off the album MDNA.The song would fit perfect between her Sorry and Celebration songs. The song is a killer dance pop track that has Madonna singing about being a good girl gone wild, and proclaiming \\"Girls they just want to have some fun.\\" This song will remind the clubs MADONNA is still the queen of the dance floor<br /><br />I'm Addicted - A electronic club track that will get people dancing. Madonna sings about being addicted to love and compares it to a (MDMA) then sings \\"MDNA, MDNA, MDNA.\\" This is a song that is sure to get stuck on your head. The song like so many others on the album closes with an outstanding end. Put on some headphones and turn it up, and you will fell like your on some kind of drug especially toward the end.<br /><br />Turn Up the Radio - This is a great summer song and feels like classic Madonna. This song will get stuck in your head and should be the next single. Very radio friendly pop song that has Madonna singing a care free song about letting the music take you away from the cares of the world. She sings \\"Turn Up The Radio, turn up the radio. Don't ask me where I wanna go, we've gotta turn up the radio.\\"<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin - The first single off the album and definitely one of the weakest. Featuring Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. the song is just a fun catchy song that gets the phrase \\"L U V MADONNA, Y O U you wanna\\" stuck in your head.<br /><br />Some Girls - Is a techno song with some killer bass. Madonna has her voice distorted and sounds like she's singing in a tunnel at times, but it works perfect. I will admit it took a few listens to like this. The song has Madonnas vocals change and are drowned out by the heavy beats and bass. Madonna sings \\"Some girls are not like me, I'd never wanna be like some girls.\\" This is another amazing club song.<br /><br />Superstar - The song is by far one of the catchiest songs and one of my favorites on the album. It's a simple song that recalls the fun and simplicity of Cherish and features background vocals by her daughter Lola. She sings playfully about being madly in love with her new boyfriend. Besides singing about people she admires she also sings \\"You can have the password to my phone, I'll give you a massage when you get home.\\" It's a simple song but one of my favorites and is catchy as hell.<br /><br />I Don't Give A - One of the stand out mid tempo tracks on the album that seems like it could be Till Death Do Us Part meets American Life. Madonna gets the most personal in years. It sounds like she is referring to Guy Ritchie where she sings \\"I tried to be a good girl, I tried to be your wife, I diminished myself, and it swallowed my light, I tried to become all that you expect of me, and if it was a failure I don't give a ...\\" Nicki Minaj also makes an appearance where she raps what sounds like \\"Yo MADONNA you original than GAGA\\" however a friend pointed out she actually says DADA which is a surrealistic movement from the early 1900s (thanks Sasha).<br /><br />I'm a Sinner - Is a song that would fit perfect along side Beautiful Stranger, Amazing and even Ray of Light. This is classic William Orbit and Madonna doing what they both do best. With the guitar and Madonna throwing the names of saints this one of my favorite songs on the album. With another 60`s vibe and a chorus that has her admit \\"I'm a sinner, I like it that way,\\" one can't help but get lost in the song, and bring back memories of those early William Orbit and Madonna days. Another one of my favorites.<br /><br />Love Spent - Probably my very favorite song on the album. Has those electronic bleeps and sounds courtesy of former Ray of Light producer William Orbit. Madonna gets personal here and sings about feeling like her lover put his money before her. Can only make you wonder if she's referring to the large settlement Guy Ritchie got from her from their divorce. She sings \\"Feeling love spent, Yeah, I'm love spent, Wondering where the love went, Love spent, Yeah I'm love spent, Really love spent, Wondering where it all went.\\" At about the two minute and five second mark the song climaxes to an amazing close. The acoustic version available on the super bowl deluxe edition is just as beautiful, but more raw.<br /><br />Masterpiece - A gorgeous ballad where Madonnas voice shines. She sings about being in love with someone who in her eyes is a Masterpiece. With words like \\"I cant tell you why, it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece,\\" this is one of the most beautiful ballads Madonna has wrote in years. Its no wonder the song won a Golden Globe at the 2011 awards show.<br /><br />Falling Free - Another beautiful ballad that has a haunting vibe by the piano. The song has one of the strongest vocal performances from Madonna as she sings \\"We're Both Free, Free To Go,\\" which makes you wonder if it's about her x husband Guy Ritchie. The song would fit perfect along side Drowned World/Substitute For Love and Gone.ite songs on the album.

The song has a late 70's early 80's vibe with strings that bring back to mind her classics songs Papa Don't preach and Angel. She sings \\"Can't really talk with a gun in my mouth, maybe thats what you've been dreaming about.\\" The song is a tribute to french film star Alain Delon. This is another catchy song that will get stuck in your head.<br /><br />I F***** Up - One of the most beautiful and personal ballads Madonna has ever wrote. Yet another song than can be about Guy Ritchie, but here Madonna takes responsibility admitting she made a mistake. With emotional lyrics like \\"I thought we had it all, you brought out the best in me, somehow I destroyed the perfect dream,\\" Madonna does something she rarely ever does and admits she made a mistake. Don't let the song title fool you, it's Madonna being as honest as she ever has both with her lyrics and possibly her relationship.<br /><br />B-day Song - The song is just a good time song that would fit perfect in the True Blue album days. It also has that Beautiful Stranger retro vibe to it. The song has no real message other than Madonna singing fun lyrics about what she likes (spanking) on her birthday. The song also features M.I.A. and I have to say is one of the weakest singles on the album.<br /><br />Best Friend - Madonna is once again in a reflective mood with this beautiful mid tempo song. Yet another song that could be about Guy Ritchie. She sings about mourning the loss of her partner, which makes her feel life she's lost her best friend. She sings \\"I can not lie and I wont pretend, but I feel like I lost my very best friend.\\" A very personal song that is another one of her most personal songs.<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin' (Party Rock Remix) - A remix of Give Me All Your Luvin featuring Nicki Minaj and LMFAO.

B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I kept hearing how great a masterpiece The Descendants was and wanted to see it for myself. I'm not always a big fan of Oscar winning dramas. Not because I don't think they are well written or well acted movies, but sometimes I find them... well... boring.<br /><br />What can I say? I tend to watch movies for enjoyment and entertainment value more than for any other reason.<br /><br />The Descendants was well written and acted by the cast. George Clooney rarely disappoints me as an actor and I believed his character. The crazy gamut of emotions he and his daughters were put through due to his wife's accident were very realistic.  Not everyone grieves in the same way and this was evident in the movie. Kids may act out, family members may point fingers, friends may feel guilty... It tests a person greatly to deal with losing someone.<br /><br />And not just losing anyone - but coming to terms with the fact that a loved one will never wake up from a coma.<br /><br />Amidst the grieving process, Clooney is in charge of helping his family deal with their trust estate. The trust owns many acres of virgin Hawaii land. He and his cousins must sell it before the trust dissolves in 7 years. They are going through bids to find a buyer they are comfortable selling their ancestor's land to for development. While they are descendants of Hawaiian people, there are many native residents that do not want the sale to go through.<br /><br />I thought the entire story was believable and hit close to home - besides the land, the devastation that swept over this family could happen to just about any of us. Any day a loved one could be in an accident that puts them in a vegetative state, leaving the rest to figure out how to live without them. What words were last said... Secrets unveiled... How do you get closure on anger with someone you can never speak with again?<br /><br />The ending reflected real life too by being sort of \\"happy enough for now.\\" it wasn't a sad ending but it was not a definite happy ending.<br /><br />Some takeaway messages I found in this movie:<br /><br />Some things are worth preserving as is even if it means losing out on millions of dollars because doing the right thing is always priceless.<br />Some things are better left unknown.<br />Always be honest with those you love.<br />Verdict: Rent it! While I thought it was a good movie, I did not really enjoy it. It was real and emotion driven, but I don't find much rewatchability in these types of movies. (Save for a few favorites).  I tend to rewatch ones that make me feel good and laugh more often than any other type of movie.<br /><br />*I received a promotional review copy of the DVD.t a definite happy ending.<br /><br />Some takeaway messages I found in this movie:<br /><br />Some things are worth preserving as is even if it means losing out on millions of dollars because doing the right thing is always priceless.<br />Some things are better left unknown.<br />Always be honest with those you love.<br />Verdict: Rent it!

0312641893|4.0|I do not read fairy tale spinoffs often. Beastly & A Kiss in Time by Alex Flinn were okay but it never sparked my interest to continue reading the same theme. Cinder changed that. The premise is unique and entertaining. Halfway through, I found myself falling for this book... but not quite at the end. I thought it was stretched long, or did the story started to drag on the 2nd half? Maybe. Still, Cinder is worth checking out.<br /><br />Cinder was not a pushover, but... she does have a slight tendency to cower down (only a few times) because of guilt. Guilt over her sister's illness. Guilt over her being so different from everyone else. I loved it when she speaks up against her stepmom (such a bully). Cinder as a cyborg helped to take away the idea of \\"fairy tale Cinderella\\" per se. Cinder's sarcasm was also enjoyable. Prince Kai was in all ways charming. And befitting to be the Emperor of East Commonwealth. I thoroughly liked his scenes with Cinder. Electrifying and smile-inducing. =)<br /><br />The concept of Lunars is the highlight for me. It was exciting to read about these moon people. I love the character of the Lunar queen - so dominant and badass! This sci-fi element was just right, along with the androids and cyborgs. Overall, the story was conceivable. It was a fun read!<br /><br />Cinder is a good start for a series. The vulnerability brought about by the fairy tale retelling was balanced by the strength portrayed by cyborgs/Lunars. Could \\"happily ever after\\" happen to Cinder? I hope so. Let's see on the next installment, Scarlet.

B00756GKBA|5.0|As a thirty-three year old man, I've been a fan of Madonna since I was five or six years old, back then much to my mother's chagrin.  So I grew up watching this woman reinvent herself and pop music over and over and over again.  As her career advanced and her album count grew, Madonna took over a great majority of the song-writing duties (1989's Like a Prayer), began managing her own career with Maverick Records (under the Warner Bros. umbrella), and shocked the world many times over with her blatant sexual and religious imagery.<br /><br />Now, I am not one of those fans who blindly adores everything my favorite artists do.  In fact I think a true fan will admit when they don't necessarily care for something one of their favorite artists do.  It shows a willingness to actually peel back the layers and examine the piece from different perspectives.  2008's Hard Candy as a whole truly disappointed me.  The disc definitely boasted some great tunes.  The lead single \\"4 Minutes,\\" featuring Justin Timberlake and Timbaland was catchy and fun, and I enjoyed the more adult-contemporary ballad-like third single \\"Miles Away,\\" which seemed to indicate trouble in paradise for Madge and Guy Ritchie.  I also really enjoyed \\"Heartbeat\\" and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You.\\"  Beyond those four tracks, everything else was just okay or mediocre in my opinion.  Pharrell Williams' influence as a co-writer is very evident and as much I enjoy Pharrell as an artist, I do not feel the urban pop vibe fit Madonna very well, though I absolutely commended her for even bothering to go there.<br /><br />When I heard M.D.N.A.'s lead single, \\"Give Me All Your Luvin',\\" I was equally disappointed and very, very vocal about my disappointment.  Even though Hard Candy did hit #1 on the album charts, it sold 500,000 copies.  This was rather paltry considering her previous effort, Confessions on a Dance Floor (released at the tail end of 2005), sold 350,000 copies in its first week.  To date, Confessions...has sold over 3 million copies.  I had been hoping Madonna would return to her Confessions formula.  After all, Madonna is the Queen of Pop; she's pretty much been everywhere and she's done everything.  There aren't really many more envelopes Madonna could realistically push and keep her artistic integrity intact.  The euro-synth pop of Confessions suits Madonna much more than the urban pop of Hard Candy.<br /><br />M.D.N.A.'s second single, \\"Girl Gone Wild,\\" gave me hope.  The confection of hard driving beats and synth-pop, along with catchy lyrics and a killer (and HOT!!) music video gave me hope I would enjoy the new disc.  Much to my surprise M.D.N.A is definitely more like Confessions than Hard Candy, while still managing to break new ground.  In fact, I'd say M.D.N.A. combines the euro-synth pop of Confessions with dramatic infusions of the guitar/electronica of Ray of Light.  Speaking of Ray of Light, producer William Orbit is back and contributes his genius to this record.  Benny Benassi and Martin Solveig round out the list of major producers, although Alle Benassi, Demolition Crew, Free School, Indiigo, and Michael Malih contribute to production.<br /><br />M.D.N.A. is full of amazing material.  The wealth of dance pop/club music on this album is shockingly amazing, a step up from Confessions and Ray of Light, and dominates most of the project (the ballads, or ballad-like tracks, do not interfere with the flow of the pulse-pounding dance tracks).  My only real complaint about the album is still its lead single, \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'.\\"  I've give it several listens and I just cannot get into it.  The album version sounds to me like nothing more than a blatant rip off of Toni Basil's \\"Hey Mickey\\" and Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl.\\"  I thought why is the Queen of Pop, who has defined pop music for thirty years, trying to pander to 13 year old girls?  Obviously she had different intentions for the track, I just don't get it.  I do enjoy the remix of the track, which is on the second disc, much better.  So, to me, loving 15 tracks and liking 1 out of 17 total is a win in my book ...<br /><br />If/when more singles are released, I think \\"Masterpiece,\\" \\"Beautiful Killer,\\" and \\"I Don't Give A...\\" would be the best choices.<br /><br />Welcome back Madge!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This series is wonderful!!!! Love Love Love it!!!<br /><br />Well worth the time and money to buy the whole series! i am on book 5 now and cant put it down!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I came to know about this book due to the recent release of the movie. So I decided to read the booka and I'm so glad that I did. Someone told me this book was about death....I disagree. This book is about the love of a sister, the struggles of loving two people, following the rules but wanting to rebell, and the fight to survive. I hated the way that the book ended, but I guess that means I have to read the next one. Great Job Ms Collins!!
1435107683|5.0|The book is delightful !!! I read this book to my son when he was preschool age and it was one of his favorites. The owl is adorable. He is also one of my favorite characters. Especially the story about \\"tear water tea'.
B001O6W9QC|4.0|A celebrity-soaked Ben Stiller comedy that sends up sentimental, over-dramatic war epics and the pretentious Hollywood elite that make their bank on them. Stiller, Jack Black and a blackface-wearing Robert Downey Jr. share the center of the stage as hopelessly detached superstar actors who are unceremoniously dumped into the bush but still believe they're on the set. Each gets their homerun lines and the primary story is lots of fun, but the real stars are the unchained phony movie trailers, advertisements and celebrity cameos that speckle the picture. Tom Cruise in particular is a major scene stealer as the hairy, chunky, balding movie exec with no filter - every single one of his all-too-brief appearances left me aching with laughter and yearning for more. Who knew he had such an intensely funny side? It's among the rare breed of comedies that never stops being hilarious, even for a little while, and one of the most unabashedly funny films I've seen in a long time.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I M So thrilled to see Madonna deliver her best album since 98's Ray Of Light. It's honestly Her Most Personal Album Ever. Even More Personal Than Lady Gaga's Born This Way... Madonna At 53 Went Thru A Painful Divorce. Tracks Love Spent And I Don't Give A:.. Featuring Nicki Minaj Delivers THE Dance Tracks. While Falling Free Disc 1's Final Track Really Is Her Best Ballad Since Take A Bow. MDNA May Have Started Out Without A Bang. But Every Track Is Great. I Recommend This Album. It's The Album Of The YEAR. aND THE ALBUM OF THE DECADE. EVERYONE'S BEEN WAITING FOR.
0671578855|5.0|I love all the Miles books but this is by far my favorite. It is a clever witty comedy of manners. Despite being Sci-fi, it calls to mind other very different writers, including Georgette Heyer. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at any scene in a novel as at the famous dinner party scene in this novel. Highly recommended, even for those who are not normally fans of science fiction or fantasy.
B007G5K066|3.0|Silence can be commanding if you have any doubt listen to...nothing when the house is quiet how it seduces you almost like a crafty spy. George Smiley commands attention and respect by saying nothing. His enigmatic expression telling us...nothing. Gary Oldman deserved his Academy Award nomination for his performance in \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" which equals the outstanding performance by the late Alec Guinness in the TV adaptation from the 1980's step-for-step and establishes that performance as unique. Oldman's challenge was akin to Dustin Hoffman's in playing the lead in \\"Death of A Salesman\\" after the Academy Award winning performance by Lee J. Cobb for the original film version. In other words, it was near impossible, scary and just this side of crazy.<br /><br />Just be aware that the film is a bit slow in terms of pacing compared to most contemporary Hollywood spy movies and thrillers. \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" returns to a the slower paced spy thrillers like we saw in the 1970's which is interesting given that it takes place in 1973. You need to be prepared that this film is convoluted without the rapid cutting style films typical display today. Patience is rewarded as is paying attention to this thriller which jumps back in forth in time.<br /><br />It's 1973. George Smiley (Oldman) one of the leaders of MI6 and trusted ally of Control (John Hurt) finds himself dismissed after a meeting goes awry with an operative (the always marvelous Mark Strong) behind the iron curtain. After Control's accidental death he's brought back into the \\"Circus\\" (as MI6 is referred to) to uncover a double agent high within the command structure of the organization. Smiley must wade through the sewage of double and triple crosses, misleading clues and red herrings and try and protect one operative (Tom Hardy) that has been accused by the other department heads within the \\"Circus\\" (Toby Jones, Colin Firth, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Devid Dencik).<br /><br />\\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" receives a sharp, detailed transfer with muted colors reflecting the \\"look\\" of 1970's films while still capturing the look of higher resolution newer films. Reportedly, this doesn't look quite as good as the UK release but I can't comment because I haven't seen it to compare.<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific with a nice loss less presentation but keep in mind it isn't all that active as this is primarily a dialogue driven film.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the special features. We get Q&A with the actors about the film and while interesting, it would have been far more rewarding to have a roundtable discussion with the actors. We do get a pretty engaging commentary track by star Oldman and director Tomas Alfredson giving us quite a bit of background on the making of the film.<br /><br />We also get a short promotional featurette on the production of the film that runs under 15 minutes as well as about 7 minutes of deleted scenes. We don't, surprisingly, get the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />\\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" is the type of thriller that rewards the patient viewer and it's a strong, well made movie. Goldman's performance is the center piece of the film but he's strongly supported by a terrific cast of brilliant character actors.  Having said that, this thriller might not be for everyone.Spy\\" receives a sharp, detailed transfer with muted colors reflecting the \\"look\\" of 1970's films while still capturing the look of higher resolution newer films.

B005COO1X6|5.0|I always enjoy  Stephen King  did not really like the way this one  ended Seemed  like a big build up for a disapointing ending
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was incredible on many levels. The characters came alive the moment I began reading.  It clearly allowed the reader to know the authors purpose for writing the book; to give HeLa the humanistic presence she so deserves and an insight into cell research. A great blend of historical correction and how scientist involved in research regarded a segment of the population that was/is disenfranchised. I encourage all to read this book.
0307913090|5.0|Well, I finally am enjoying the book. It took a while to get into it...like 4 cd's. It's very good, filled with all the twists an turns in a great novel.<br />I did some research and found a map of the land and kingdoms. It really helped as to the direction that things are from one another.<br />I just finished Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\" and this book is turning out to be every bit as good.<br />I plan on getting the other three books after this one.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Can anyone help me decide if I should buy this? I like angry birds but not the price.  Thanks to anyone who will help me!

B006AX6ONI|5.0|Yeah, its his bog posts, but It was a really good and inspiring read. I read this book in less thanks a few days and reread it every once in a while. People say Cuban just got lucky, thats BS. Cuban has a HARD WORK ETHIC, something that not a lot of people have and would like to just say he got lucky. Read this book.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Very light cover. Love it because it allows me to slide my kindle right in the back pocket of my purse. Protects the kindle well and so much less bulky than the zip up type. The elastic strap doubles as a hold strap when reading. I will say the stand feature isn't great because the lightest touch knocks it over. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.
140053271X|4.0|I was given a Nook touch screen for Christmas and while excited, I really didn't want to convert to an e reader.  I love the feel and smell of a book.  Plus, there is something about seeing the progress, and holing it in your hands that I just love.  My husband has the original nook, and I tried out a book on it.  It was ok, but it was big, and clunky and heavy.  So, the new nook has that going for it.  I  downloaded a book right away and fell in love with it.  It's easy to buy books on it, share them, and my husband and I could  read the same book at the same time and it didn't mess with where each other were at in the book.  I love that I can tap the page and it turns, but that's also why I gave it four stars because my kids will tap the screen or it will get touched as I put it down, then when I pick it back up it's on a different page.  I do love some features about it that are much improved over the old nook.  It's so much easier to look up the meaning of a word, you can have a wish list for books you want to buy, which you can't do on the old one.  I also love that you can pick your font and size of the font.  Any book you buy can become a large print...for those that need it.  While I still pick  up a regular book, my nook is enjoyable, and easy to take along, doesn't rip or get torn up.  I love it and would suggest it for anyone looking at purchasing an e reader.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Overkill is one of the best working bands in heavy music today, consistently touring and releasing great records. The Electric Age, their 16th studio record, had some tough shoes to fill, as Ironbound (2010) was/is an astonishing piece of work.<br /><br />The Electric Age delivers, and then some.<br /><br />Everything here is top notch. The riffs are great. The bass/drum attack is always on point. Blitz sounds pissed and passionate. One of the nice things for me is hearing the improved soloing on this record. Ironbound started the trend and The Electric Age continues it. These solos have substance, instead of just flurries of notes.<br /><br />Once this record starts, it punches you in the face for it's entire running time, with barely a moment of respite. A must have and an early contender for album of the year.
1932100660|2.0|As with other books on this subject, it did not address the specific issues that I was really interested in, although it has helped my brother, who suffered from aggressive prostate cancer.  So, on that count, I can say that if Cancer is something that is relative to the issue, buy it.  It couldn't hurt.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't waste your money. There are plenty of 99 cent romance books to get you through your boring commute on a train if that is what you are looking for. The story line is as interesting to read as reading the back of a fiber cereal box.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to buy a case online without actually being able to handle it and see its full properties.  Well when it arrived I was very happy with how sleek it managed to keep the kindle fire.  The way is stands on its side is a little precarious, but I've only had it fall flat on the table twice in the 3 weeks I've had it (I probably didn't have it in the groove all the way across).  One thing I would of liked is a way to stand it vertically with the case.  Overall a nice sleek case that doesn't add much to the size of the kindle fire, well worth the $20.00.
0226264211|5.0|When I read it a few years ago, this book turned economics into a hobby for me.  It has since been read by friends as well as re read by me.  The facts Freidman presents on tariffs, occupational licensure and poverty cannot be ignored.  If you are a believer in freedom and the truth buy this book.

B005L38QK2|5.0|After 6 years of using a G7, the batteries finally gave out (and cracked completely).  Being an avid blizzard fan and a person who likes a more simplistic mouse (in style, fewer buttons) this mouse was right up my alley.<br /><br />Being on the expensive side, I was weary but after 2 months of use I could not be happier...here is a short list of the pros:<br /><br />+ Smooth rubber feel<br />+ Awesome aesthetics<br />+ Solid design, simple but functional<br /><br />and a few quirks<br /><br />- Cord length seems just a tad short<br />- Price still just a little bit more than it should be for its functionality<br /><br />Overall for someone not eager to macro everything under the sun, but yearning for something simple, with outstanding 'look and feel' - look no further.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books were reccommended to me through my kindle after I read The Hunger Games.  I was like hmmmm what ever this is.  Skipped over it, then later got curious.  I read the reviews to find out what this was all about, and was afraid of the BDSM story line.  I have never read anything like that before.  I thought it was going to be a lore more ... aggressive, than it was.  A lot of people are complaining about the grammer, british terms, and how it is repetitive.  So very true ... the blushing is annoying, and I have some kind of hope that through the last book (currently reading the second) she will snap out of it, but I doubt it.  But those things aside, I really like the book(s).  I love the love story (I am a sucker though), and how they are growing.  So all in all I very much liked the book and am currently enjoying the second, plan on purchasing the third.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|tHIS MOVIE LEFT ME QUESTIONING A LOT OF THINGS...I believe we R to be left with the moral of the story...simply being....dont let others direct ur life & tell u whats right or wrong! If U have a gut feeling..go with it. If u have these dreams/ visions-believe in them..esp. when they are not only there in your head..strong intuitions but feelings..dont let others tell you do diffrent!! Even if its a woman (ur wife) or a Dr. U know what your thinking/ feeling! Go with ur guts no matter what!!!

B004QK5N5W|2.0|AV adapter is great when it works. The poor design of the Apple docking connector (at one end of the adapter) allows it to be dragged loose by any weight applied to it. e.g. the adapter itself and/or the weight of any HDMI cable attached to the other end of the adapter. Nothing locks the connector into the Ipad except friction. The result is frequent disconnects from wiggling loose with resultant interruptions of program materials or occasional complete losses requiring a start over.  All-in-all, a real pain.  But when it works (80% of the time) it is really handy.
B001PPLIFU|3.0|Fast paced (too fast, frenetic?) Bond movie, with the usual mix of action, car chases, hard but never repelling violence and tremendous explosions. Call me nostalgic, but I preferred the more deliberate pace of Connery and Moore. In this movie I often found myself having to make an effort to follow the action. It looked more like a film preview, where they try to pack everything is a 2-minute extract, or a Music TV show.<br /><br />Acting is very good all around, and this is the major strength of the movie. The flying scenes are superb if a bit too incredible. Bond's witty humour comes out regularly, as usual, and Craig is almost as good as Connery.<br /><br />The BD contains interesting bonus scenes and backstage material.

B005FPT51K|3.0|I pity the non-\\"tech savvy\\" who buy this. The instructions are pitiful. Once setup, I found that the wireless was, for the most part, useless. The functional range from the wireless router to the iBaby was measured in inches. Most people don't put the router in the baby's room. In order to get it to work, we had to put it on a wire. Wire is faster, so it's a better technical solution, but don't give me wireless that doesn't work. Feature-wise, it's great. Grandma can watch the baby from 2 hours away. You can move the camera if the baby moves out of view. You don't need a iPhone/iPad to actually watch the baby. All you need is a browser.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|I read this book as a Freshman in high school and was shocked by it's graphic nature, but it is the twistedness of the story that made it have such an impact.  Readers either have already or absolutely must read this one.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I don't know how anyone could say that this is made for people who originally watched the 90's/early 2000's Star Wars movies...  I thought they were okay, but not nearly as good as the original.  Part 3 was great until the hilarious darth vader noooo scene.<br /><br />So here we have another George Lucas revision to his movies...  And this is not turning old movies into the new ones sorry to say, it's more or less turning them into crap.  When Obi Wan does his krayt dragon call, he now sounds like a crazy old man.  Better run sand people!  That crazy old man is coming for ya!<br /><br />Then we have the infamous greedo scene.  I know it was in the 1997 version, but it's still there.  You had a guy who was a badass, and you make greedo shoot first and miss.  It's rediculous.  Georgey should go and ask tough guys how being tough is before making any more changes and making bad guys look even dumber...<br /><br />Such as Darth Vader.  So now Georgey boy makes Darth yell noooooo when throwing the emperor into the pit.  I'm guessing the emperor didn't notice Darth yelling nooooo?  You could hear that a mile away!  If they made a dumb and dumber 2, that sound should be the new most annoying sound in the world!<br /><br />So no, not everyone in our generation likes watching Georgey boy transform badass dark lords, anti heroes, and tough old men into crazy old men, guys who get shot at by idiots, and emo dark lords.  We actually like good movies.  Ignoring sales..

I fell in love with the characters and felt their joy and pain all through the pages. If you want a good read, it's well worth the price of the book. I highly recommend this book. I definitely will be telling my family and friends to read it!

B0002VFXFE|5.0|For a few bucks, this greatly improved my CPU performance. With stock Intel heatsink/fan, my CPU was running at 35-36c @ idle. After removing the stock thermal compound with a cotton swab and benzyl alcohol, I applied a thin layer of Arctic Silver to the heatsing and CPU. I immediately powered on the system, let sit @ idle for about 30mins, and checked my temps. The CPU was running 5 degrees cooler! - Thanks to Arctic Silver, my computer now idles at 29-30c!<br /><br />Amazing product!

0316154687|4.0|Sedaris is fun to read and easy to read in the same way that a conversation with a good friend who has a quirky sense of humor is fun and easy to hold.  I've read a bunch -- a trough(?) -- of Sedaris' earlier books, and recall myself laughing no end at earlier reads.  This one offered fewer laugh-out-loud moments than his earlier collections, but it did offer a vast assortment of quiet chuckle moments, which is still an accomplishment.  Sedaris has a unique perspective and style.  You like them or you don't.  Me: I like them.  I don't turn to Sedaris for enlightenment, challenge, depth; I turn to him for entertainment and a bit of light voyeuristic escapism.  The one thing I can't help but wonder, though, is whether all the stories he tells are true.  How many genuinely quirky experiences can one man have -- let alone recall in such detail?  I'd certainly feel cheated to learn they're not true, not simply that they stretch the truth within the bounds of creative license.  But I can't imagine that any dogged fact checkers are out there seeking to verify the details of Sedaris' kicked smoking habit or his parents' art collection.  So, I'll have to take a lot on faith.  Easy enough: it's fun to read Sedaris.  As long as he continues cranking out his life vignettes, I'll continue reading them.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|The interface is slick.  I like the bluebird overlay on the books page.  It's not intrusive but always available.  What is missing for me is something I had on my \\"Kindle\\" before I upgraded to \\"Fire\\".  Previously, when I finished a book, a window popped up asking if I wanted to share, via Twitter, that I had just finished reading this particular book.  I loved that option.  It generated some interesting conversation with my Facebook folk.<br /><br />I've looked around for it without success, so I'm assuming it's gone.  I'd love to be wrong.

030788743X|5.0|I don't usually read too many books that are targeted to the adult crowd, even though this one is I could see many young adult readers enjoying this book. This book was great. Action packed, suspenseful, humorous, intense... I could go on.<br />The plot of the story was so original from anything I have read in the past. I wasn't sure how I would receive the story but it has some great reviews, so I decided to give it a try.<br />The story is told from a 17 going on 18 year old boy, Wade, who spends all his time in an online simulated world in the year 2044.  He goes to school, socializes, and works in this alternate online reality. At the beginning one of his icons, the inventor of this online world dies. Before he dies he creates a video will that announces a contest in which the winner will receive his legacy... the online world and his billions. From there the contest begins and the race is on.<br />I loved wade. He is smart, committed, a little crazy, and very geeky. I found myself deep in his story and I never ceased to be amazed and surprised at what he accomplishes. Other characters are introduced in the story, but we do not get to know them too well, what we do get to know was enough to make me adore them.<br />The world the author created was mystifying. I could see how things today could progress into this world in the future.  Everything technical and computerized.  The author didn't just create a new world for me to visit but also made me nostalgic for the past. The entire book is like a dedication to the 80's, from the commercials to the movies and games.<br />The writing is very detailed and at some points a little confusing with the futuristic jargons, but it did not take away from the enjoyment of the book. It is a little slow at the beginning but once it takes off about a quarter of way through the book, it's becomes a page turner. I did not want to put it down.<br />At the end I found myself happy and satisfied but I still couldn't help to want a little bit more. This will be a book I am sure I will find myself reading multiple times.ittle bit more. This will be a book I am sure I will find myself reading multiple times.
B006PTL1QM|1.0|This movie is just another example of how ancient superstition poisons people to perpetuate the psychoanalysis scam.  Freud and Jung are charlatans.  The book, The Reluctant Alliance Between Behaviorism And Humanism shows how science overcomes the superstition of psychoanalyst's and documents effective methodology, but this movie ignores the truth and continues to perpetuate this ignorant behavior.  Sad.  Psychoanalysts use the ancient superstition that you have a magical, self initiating force in your brain called a soul/will that gives you free willy. This assumption allows psychos (psychoanalysts), that never solve a problem, to blame you for your behavior. The best way to control anyone is too make them think they have a little man inside their heads to control their behavior. You have a problem it is up to you, take some personal responsibility. Never works.  Solving unhealthy behavior involves re-arranging the contingencies of reinforcement to reinforce healthy behavior, but that would take too much time, too many resources, and continuous adaption. Too difficult. It is much easier to tell people it is up to them AND have people feel good about being able to talk about things they cannot say to others in this culture AND repeating cultural cliché's articulately, ad infinitum. Easy, but wrong.  Psychoanalysis is a cruel tool that never works and this movie continues to foster this dangerous method.  It is much easier to tell others to take responsibility and never take any responsibility of their own to shape healthy behavior. No problem ever gets solved, but the psychos get paid a ton to listen to you get to talk of subjects that are taboo in this culture and feel much better for an hour. You have to want change. How great. A way of doing nothing and not observing that circumstances make us want things and rearranging contingencies determines wanting what is healthy or unhealthy, but they ignore the facts.  They don't have to do a thing, they put all their lies/superstitions on you. You get to feel like you are solving problems, but actually you just schedule endless appointments and the vicious cycle never ends. Everybody wins. Viva La Psycho! Sarcasm is entertaining and what this movie needs, but instead the movie continues to reinforce ignorance and that is sad.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This is short and sweet - I cried through the entire viewing. I first saw this when it came out in the 1980's, purchased the music on CD/DVD, then lost it. Haven't viewed this in a long time - I write music myself (non-professionally), played the violin at age eleven, and grew up on classical music. The Phantom has got to be the most impressive music/lyrics I have ever witnessed. 'Nough said.

B00709GTGS|3.0|This is concerning the forthcoming Blu-Ray release due out on the 10th (I received an advance copy for review).  The A/V upgrade is notable and probably worth a purchase for fans of the film eagerly waiting to retire their DVDs.  Unfortunately, no new bonus features are included, and the theatrical version is also absent.  So if you prefer the \\"Director's Cut\\" and appreciate a good transfer / sound mix, it's worth the modest MSRP.<br /><br />But that cover is hideous.  Looks like Meg Ryan is posing with a wax sculpture.
0439023521|5.0|All Katniss Everdeen has ever known is the poverty and hunger of life in the Seam, the poorest part of District 12 in the country of Panem. Panem rose from the ashes of what was once North America, now a shining Capitol that wields an iron control over its twelve districts, with an empty thirteenth left wasted as a warning to any who dream of defying the Capitol's rule. The hardscrabble existence of life in one of the poorest districts robbed Katniss of her beloved father, forcing her into the role of family breadwinner through illegal hunting and trade. When Reaping Day arrives -- the annual event when one boy and one girl are randomly chosen to fight in the Hunger Games -- Katniss's world is rocked when her beloved sister Prim is selected as tribute. With no thought but saving her sister, Katniss volunteers to take her place, catapulting her into the national spotlight. The Games are a brutal reminder of the Capitol's iron control, a world Katniss is determined to survive. In a world that seeks to strip individuals of their humanity and individuality, a world that demands unquestioning obedience and conformity, can a mere girl with an unquenchable fire in her survive? For Katniss is determined not to go quietly into that dark night that the Games demands...<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a wholly absorbing novel of one girl's fight to survive against a system that has reduced her existence, her hope of a future, to a mere \\"entertainment.\\" Through Collins's relentless, tense, urgent prose we're thrust deep into Katniss's point-of-view. She's an interesting first person narrator -- because of her youth it is perhaps tempting to question the reliability of her viewpoint. But in the end it is the fact that she is such a mass of contradictions -- mature beyond her years as the family provider, jaded, a hardened survivalist, yet uncertain of her own self-worth and unaware of the effect she has on others -- that in the end is what allows one to fully appreciate the horrific implications of the Hunger Games. For Katniss hails from a future where violent death is the biggest entertainment and the greatest weapon the government possesses, where a tribute is reduced to a pawn, their innocence subjugated to society's bloodlust. And the greatest risk Katniss can take is opening her heart to the realization that she is worthy of a love beyond comprehension -- and the greatest rebellion is daring to dictate one's last breath. Collins's first venture into the world of Panem and its districts is a completely absorbing read, a wild, pulse-pounding ride that grabbed me by the throat and didn't release me until the final page. And even then, the power of this story remained.<br /><br />Collins's invention of the Hunger Games is a searing indictment of our self-gratifying, 24-hour news cycle, reality entertainment obsessed culture, wrapped in a relentlessly thrilling package. There is no time wasted diving deeply into the bleak world of District 12 -- this is a new reality that the narrative drives us to accept in the same manner Katniss and her peers matter-of-factly accept the requirement of tribute and teenage death matches as a simple fact of life. The shock is jarring, Collins daring readers to examine our own culture and its -- dare we think it -- similarities to Panem in the objectification of human life through our entertainment, both reality and scripted, that sterilizes the cost of war, reducing human pain to an arena event.<br /><br />For all the horror of the harsh reality Collins presents, it's shot through with rays of hope, unexpected moments of light that shine all the brighter for the bleak, repressive regime of Panem with its callous disregard for basic humanity. Peeta, Katniss's fellow tribute from District 12, is a gorgeously-rendered example of humility, self-sacrifice, and love in a world gone mad -- a love so pure, so without reservation, that Katniss simply cannot comprehend it when they first meet. Of course, by focusingon Katniss's coming-of-age journey -- and by association Peeta's as well -- Collins never really fleshes out the identities of their fellow tributes. By making Katniss and Peeta the most sympathetic characters, the ones who capture readers' hearts, it's tempting to forget the cost of their victory -- until we see it etched in the emotional wounds of their hollow victory.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a challenging, thought-provoking thrill ride. A gripping, well-plotted novel that's nearly flawless in its execution, in its ability to draw you into its world, make you emotionally invested in the leads, and then make you question how you view this story, how many steps our own culture is from the world of the Games, because after all, haven't we been there before with Rome and her coliseum? Bring on the sequel!on Katniss's coming-of-age journey -- and by association Peeta's as well -- Collins never really fleshes out the identities of their fellow tributes.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this book just because it made it to the top of the besteseller list and is an erotic novel, a bdsm novel even. I figured it would at least be hot. I was wrong.<br /><br />My first problem with this book is that the plot is weak. If you use the plot through all three books, it would make one book (although not a great one). Repetitive sex scenes are used to drag this out into 3 books, thus three times the profit. I feel ripped off because of that. The first two books combined only cover 5 weeks.<br /><br />The basic story is classic romance novel with a weird bdsm twist that just doesn't work. 21 year old virgin is heavily pursued by an amazingly hot 27 year old billionaire. She isn't interested in his money. Actually she finds it annoying that he buys her gifts. He pursues her relentlessly and she has to give in, even though she has no interest in bdsm and he is only interested in bdsm. It doesn't have any of the wonderful bdsm seduction of classics like 9 1/2 weeks where the relatively innocent girl is seduced by the dominant man and realizes she wants it. This is a rather cold sterile story of a girl being presented with a bdsm contract by a man she barely knows and still getting involved with him even though she didn't even know bdsm existed before that moment. Not very believable.<br /><br />The writing and editing are weak. This book is full of annoying repetitive phrases. Holy XXXX.... over and over. Then there is a lame repetitive dialogue with her inner goddess. That got old fast. And of course, there is constant talk about hot and gorgeous Christian is. It seems like about once per page she marvels at how hot he is. I can't believe that a major publishing house released this without a MAJOR edit.<br /><br />I can't really figure out how this is being described as an erotic novel. There *is* a lot of sex in it. However, it's not really erotic. The sex descriptions are full of bad romance novel euphemisms. When she has an orgams she \\"explodes around him in a million pieces.\\" And he touches her \\"down there\\". Yes, seriously, the books says \\"down there.\\" And even if you can get over the weak euphemisms, the descriptions are kind of cold and clinical. He touches her, she touches him..... but there doesn't seem to be much real emotion.<br /><br />Christian has crazy mood swings. He is angry, possessive, jealous.... even stalks her. That's romantic? I don't care that this started as fan fiction but it actually would make more sense if he was still a vampire instead of an emotionally damaged billionaire.<br /><br />And my last complaint is about the bdsm aspect of the book. BDSM in an erotic book can be hot. But this isn't hot. He didn't seduce her and make her want to submit. Instead, he first presented her with a lengthy contract. This screams that the author did some internet research on bdsm but never really experienced it herself. She threw in all the keywords: safe, sane, and consensual, safeword, hard limits, etc. But in the real world of bdsm, people talk and communicate and get to know each other. Yeah, I know that in internet chat rooms they send each other a questionnaire to fill out and negotiate that contract. I suspect she did some internet research on bdsm so she could replace the main character being a vampire with being a Dom. But you really shouldn't write what you don't have a clue about in reality. A good dominant man makes my knees weak, but Christian just made me want to drive him to his therapist to work out his mommy issues.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because some of the sex is pretty hot. Unfortunately, it gets pretty repetitive. By the middle of the 2nd book I was skimming the sex scenes and hoping to get a little more meat of the plot. I haven't managed to finish the 3rd book yet.him in a million pieces.\\" And he touches her \\"down there\\".

B0013527I4|5.0|Brought back my wonderful childhood memories of watching The Muppet Show early Saturday mornings.  I order all the seasons.  A few weeks ago cable was out at my residence for an entire 24 hour.  No need to panic, I had my DVDs to watch.  My only regret was having to see that majority of the guest stars are now deceased.  Highly recommend purchasing if you're from Generation X!
B0078YXF4Y|5.0|Michael Shannon delivers an outstanding performance as Curtis, a working class Midwesterner overcome by a disturbing, foreboding sense of impending doom in \\"Take Shelter,\\" a menacingly brilliant film in which every scene intensifies the mounting tension of Curtis' life. As horrific dreams disturb Curtis, we witness his devoted wife Samantha (played, in another astounding performance, by Jessica Chastain, who seems to be cornering the market on suffering middle-class wife roles) desperately trying to maintain some sense of normality in their lives by selling her wares at a swap meet and taking care of their young deaf daughter. Curtis witnesses coming storms that only he seems to see. He begins exhibiting bizarre behavior that threatens his relationship with his wife, jeopardizes his job, and undermines his credibility in the community. Writer-director Jeff Nichols masterfully weaves a complex tale of one man's apparent mental collapse and its consequences on those around him--but strong undercurrents of uncertainty permeate throughout this film. Is Curtis really losing his mind? Are his visions and dreams really omens of what is to come? Never before have I rooted so hard for a character's sanity. The tension mounts to an almost unbearable climax--only to yield to a truly remarkable final scene. See this movie--it is a powerful and majestic work of cinematic art.

B000VZYPB4|4.0|This is a great show and i like to watch it at the gym to keep me distracted on the treadmill. I can use it at home but the wifi at the gym will not work on my kindle. I also didnt realize that the show was not downloaded to the kindle but to the cloud so it does not work unless you have wifi available. I wanted to use it on a plane but without wifi you can't. That was not clear to me when i bought it or i would have just gotten the dvd.

B005BZQVF2|5.0|Paul is like a mix between the \\"arrested development\\" male comedies so prevalent nowadays and E.T. It makes for a great mix. The film stars an alien whose name is Paul. Unlike most aliens, Paul has become a wisecracking, drinking, cursing slob. The movie manages to become a spoof on a whole host of sci-fi movies, from Star Wars to E.T. to Men in Black to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Fortunately, the spoof element is subtle (no \\"Spaceballs\\" here), including cinematography that mimicked famous shots in other movies. Overall, I found the humor to be, well, generally funny, especially when Paul was involved. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost did a good job as well at being likable protagonists.<br /><br />I thought the cursing went a bit over the deep end in the unrated edition. I don't care about cursing per se, but it just seemed forced and pushed into the movie at points, as if the director wanted to see how many \\"bad words\\" he could fit into a scene. Also, Kristen Wiig's character as the Christian Fundamentalist was a bit over the top. I like the part poking fun at fundamentalists, but after she is \\"converted\\" by Paul she seems like somebody with Turret's Syndrome who curses for no reason. Unlike the two guys, her character seemed pointless after a while. This is one of the few cases where the theatrical edition might be better than the unrated one.<br /><br />Ultimately, a fun film for sci-fi fans. Definitely would recommend if you've seen a lot of sci-fi films (if not, you might not get the references).

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I read this book thinking I knew about Steve Jobs and his life. At least I thought I knew a little bit. Sure, I knew about how Apple began, how he left, came back, and made it into the most valuable and innovative company ever! That, however, is just the barest tip of the iceberg!<br /><br />This book provides amazing insight into the life and world of Steve Jobs. Where he came from, how his adoptive parents encouraged and enabled him to find his way in the world. How he saw, when no one else could, what the world of computing and the personal computer would become. His amazing insights, his incredible attention to detail, his fervent demand to keep total control over the entire product line from end to end. It's all in there!<br /><br />That is what we all kind of knew already - yet there is so much more. His seemingly crazy rants at those he worked with. The radical diets he put himself on from his teenage years onward. His inability to accept how serious his cancer was in the beginning which potentially caused him to pass when he did. There are some incredible insights into how he lived his life and what his quirks both did for the consumers of Apple products and what that did for the computer, music, and movie industries - as well as what that insatiable drive did for and to his family.<br /><br />I have not read any biographies in the past, this is really my first - it's certainly a great one. If you are a fan of the company or not, this truly will provide some amazing insight into the life and quirks of this true 21st century visionary.
B006QVRVJK|3.0|Only two things bothered me a bit:  this has been overhyped with all sorts of adjectives that do not really apply; and sometimes Foster is overdoing things a bit, surprisingly.<br /><br />The rest of the time she is great, as are her fellow actors, with an entertaining script concerning two sets of rather awful parents and an altercation between their sons.  No heartbreak but a lot of humor; many revelatory moments regarding the parenting and the marriages too.

Anyone else have this issue, if so anyone know a fix for it? I got it for, an am playing it on my Kindle Fire. If these 2 titles had sound, my review score would be a 5 star review for even with no sound, I still am having a lot of fun with it.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|I will not comment on how much of this is historically accurate since I do not know the facts.  Otherwise, the performances are mostly very good, though Knightley is a bit irritating at times, overdoing the grimaces and the odd accent.  Fassbender and Mortensen are very solid by contrast.<br />Somehow, this film left me wanting a bit more.  Did Jung have any sort of relationship with his kids?  Why did his wife stay with him?  Surely she knew he was getting around with the other women and patients.  How did Sabina's childhood abuse lead to the screaming fits and attacks that she suffered?  How many other patients benefited, or didn't, at the clinic?

0380729407|1.0|So I don't really understand why this is considered a horror novel? I feel that it was made for children and Bradbury's writing style is a little confusing at times and kind of bland.  I thought of it as more of an adventure story then anything. If you want something that is scary then this is not for you. I am a huge horror book nut but this book just didn't do it for me at all.

I have a high threshold for self-indulgence and liking ear candy, but this is just so awful. Donovan in all his silliness is far better, and he is good really at times. Maybe if they removed the lyrics, psychedelic folk dub might work.

It's very easy to operate and believe me when I tell you that I am challenged by all these new products coming out on the market today.  I was very surprised when I read the instructions and figured them out without having to call my daughter for help.<br />I also purchased the Kindle Fire Lightweight Micro Shell Folio Cover, it's the perfect fit for my Kindle.  It's sturdy though lightweight and protects the Kindle beautifully.<br />I was a little disappointed that I'm unable to read it outside, I had to strain to see the words.  All in all, I have to say that I'm extremely pleased with my Kindle and would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of buying one.

B003EYVXV4|1.0|Extremely weak adaptation of a mediocre book. They made a stupid chick-flick out of a halfway decent action-drama. Like we needed another effing Twilight... :/ Horrible, horrible camera work and poor editing. The starving heroine of the book is played by a fat-head chick. Bad, cheezy acting. The CGI of the \\"Capitol\\" was lame. Only the interior design of the train and their suite was decent. It's kinda said because the book did have some potential.

B006Z21ZEM|2.0|The music itself on En Vivo! deserves 5 stars, but for fans who buy all Iron Maiden albums, this is filled with the same songs from other live albums. How many live versions of Number of the Beast do we really need? While Maiden has pulled this stunt with past live albums, En Vivo! only has 6 'new' live songs (of 17), all from the Final Frontier.<br /><br />1 Satellite 15<br />2 The Final Frontier<br />3 El Dorado<br />4 The Talisman<br />5 Coming Home<br />6 When The Wild Wind Blows<br /><br />I figured, since it's only 6, why not just buy each 'new' song individually instead of the entire album? Can't. The best song, When The Wild Wind Blows, can only be purchased with the entire album! Come on, Iron Maiden. I've got too many live tracks of Running Free already.<br /><br />Of course, this review is only meant for someone in the same boat as me and buys all their albums. If you're new to Maiden's live albums, I'm sure you'll love this.

After the Goblet of Fire, the director had no idea how to tell the rest of the stories. They seem to have kept or took the auther out of the process.

B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Yeah, OK, Larry the Cable Guy is not in this and that's just one reason to watch it.  I was going to write a long review but just watch the darned thing...85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and that's not an easy thing to get.  With lines like \\"Oh my God they cut off his bowling fingers!\\" what you end up with is the equivalent of the Coen brothers on steroids.  Very smart, hilariously gory and surprisingly sweet.  Yup, just watch it fer crissakes.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks is landmark author within the genre. World War Z is a must read for apocalyptic literature. I call it literature because that's what it is. This book is not to be confused with the pulpy dime novels or zombie comics (not that they can't be great as well). This is a zombie classic in the making.<br /><br />Each chapter is a recorded account of first-hand survivors of World War Z, gathered and published by a narrator charged by a United Nations sort of global agency with recording the bare facts for generations to come. But bare facts isn't enough to capture the horrifying reality of what man's hubris did to the planet, so the narrator endeavors to publish this more personal novel outside of his official mission.<br /><br />Spooky and prophetic, this is a collection of gripping human stories drenched in zombie madness. Read it! Review it! Share it!

140053271X|1.0|Here's my take on NST:  This is a very nice, but very limited reader.  I LOVE THE DISPLAY.  That's it.  A real home run?  Not quite...<br /><br />Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.<br /><br />Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.<br /><br />(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).<br /><br />(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.<br /><br />(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  That's a win-win.<br /><br />So, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?  Three strikes (it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book).  This whole e-reader thing is bravo-sierra at this point.<br /><br />That's my $0.02.  Just wish I had known this before I spent the hundred dollars.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I heard about this trilogy on the morning shows. In keeping with my new resolve to dedicate some of my time to indulging in more of what captures the cultural zeitgeist, I gave Sifty Shades of Grey a try. I was also taken with the \\"word of mouth\\" popularity that the book had gotten. Generally I have respect and admiration for writers of erotica. It is not a easy as it would seem.<br /><br />There are parts of this that are regular Harlquin-like fiction:<br />-Plain girl is the obsession of rich hot boy<br />-Rich bad boy is tortured (in this case literally)but is secretly philanthropic<br />-There is a gorgeous meddling friend who is by turns self absorbed and ineffectual<br /><br />It is well parsed out in the Kindle format (making it an easy ready). The outrageously naive girl meets extremely sophisticated tortured RICH bad boy concept is well used. As with Twilight the appeal is clear. The opportunities that Anastasia has to show off her rich boyfriend speak to every ordinary girl's wish to be sigularly spectacular.<br /><br />The BDSM aspect is nothing new.The plot does lend a generic (and to borrow from the book)a vanilla quality to a lifestyle that is far more complex in reality. This is both good and bad since it does create excitement on the one hand; but it sugarcoats it and potentially deludes the average individual or the curious fool into thinking that this is some sort of playful alternative. My understanding is that the BDSM philosophy is serious stuff and not for everyone.<br /><br />As someone who was a virgin until nearly twenty and happened to have a young and wealthy first love, I can honestly say that Ana's (and for that matter Bella in Twilight's) tendency to reject even the slightest gift or kindness with such vehemence and downright rudeness rings hollow. There are many ways to say \\"no\\" without so much moral outrage. A poor college student in this economy? Really?<br /><br />Read it without expectations. Overall, I would say that the two maincharacters lack depth. The words describing action and reaction are needlessly repetetive (the lip biting, eyerolling, etc). Anastasia's inexperiece particularly with masturbation doesn't really sell itself unless you add maybe some religious stigma. Christian's immediate profile is lacking. If this is giving rise to a new genre (their calling it \\"mommy porn\\")to be read quickly and not provoke thought, then it suceeds. Unfortuantely it also seems to work as a movie pitch. Given that movies generally provide less depth than the books they are based upon, I do not see how this could be further diluted.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2CP9LLQ00P506]]I waited until after I saw the movie to do this review just so I could tell you the difference between the movie and the book.<br /><br />To give you a general idea of the story.  The story is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who is sixteen years old and she lives in the country called Panem.  Panem is divided into twelve districts, which are basically like large cities penned in by electrical fences in order to \\"protect\\" the people that live there. These twelve districts are ruled by a Capital.<br /><br />Seventy-four years before the book takes place, there was a thirteenth district that revolted and tried to free itself from Panem.  And Panem wiped it off the face of the Earth.  Now in order to keep the other twelve districts inline, Panem has a televised \\"Hunger Games\\" each year and they make each district sacrifice up one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to come to their games and fight to the death.<br /><br />Katniss's sister is picked to be the tribute for her district and Katniss is so horrified that she volunteers to take her sister's place.<br /><br />The movie stayed as close to the book as they possibly could. The main difference between the book and the movie is that you get more time in district twelve in the book.  In the movie, they gloss over the beginning and the end, and they stick to the battle between the teenagers - the fight to the death.  The movie is detailed; it's interesting; it's fantastic to watch.  It's just as good to read.  But there is stuff that is set up in the beginning of the book that makes more sense in the story then in the movie.<br /><br />I recommend definitely reading the book.  It's an easy read, well written, and completely enthralling.[[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]]
B00756GKBA|5.0|Updated (3/26/12 @ 5:20 pm Eastern)<br /><br />This album is really good. I would agree with other reviewers that this is Madonna's best album since Ray of Light. The tracks are solid, especially \\"Beautiful Killer\\", \\"Masterpiece\\", and \\"I F***ed Up\\". It's rare to listen to an album when you love 90% of the tracks. These days that's rare.<br /><br />I must admit, I needed to listen to the entire album at least twice to decide which songs were my favorite. Some of the songs required multiple plays, such as \\"Girls Gone Wild\\". At first I didn't like the chorus but after listen to it about five times, I was addicted. Like most artists these days, Madonna does use a bit of Auto-Tune but uses it in a very brilliant way.<br /><br />The best way to describe this album would be a brilliant mix of Pop/Techo/Dance. Some of the songs will remind you of her earlier hits. For example, \\"Falling Free\\" could be a 21st century version of \\"Live to Tell\\" and \\"B-Day Song\\" reminds me of \\"Beautiful Stranger\\".<br /><br />The best thing about this album is that it's something you can dance to in the club and sing out loud in the shower.<br /><br />The best songs so far are:<br /><br />1. Give Me All Your Lovin: A fast moving dance song. Apparently people love this one as it's already gotten 30 million hits on YouTube in less than 7 weeks. Plus the Super Bowl performance was amazing.<br /><br />2. Falling Free: Very moving song, again it reminds me of \\"Live to Tell\\"<br /><br />3. Girls Gone Wild: I really had to listen to this one of about five times in order to really get it. The song starts off really good but when it gets to the chorus it sounds a bit off...at first. But give it a couple of plays and you'll be addicted. The video is amazing and reminds me of her \\"Erotica\\" days.<br /><br />4. Gang Bang: During Madonna's LiveStream Facebook interview, she said this was her favorite song on the album. I'm still listening to it and it takes some getting used to. It's very hardcore and they lyrics will actually have you saying to yourself \\"D*** Madonna, you really want to kick this person's a**!\\" It's a great song and now I can understand why she loves it so much.<br /><br />5. Love Spent: The BEST song on the album so far. I could listen to this one over and over all day long. It's a catchy dance tune and the lyrics are fantastic. Definitely my favorite for now.<br /><br />6. Beautiful Killer: An amazing dance tune that will make you addicted to it on the first listen, it's amazing.<br /><br />7. Masterpiece: A wonderful slow ballad with amazing lyrics. I'm not surprised it won a Golden Globe but it should have been nominated for an Oscar as well.<br /><br />Madonna is back and she's better than ever. This album is a solid 10!cs will actually have you saying to yourself \\"D*** Madonna, you really want to kick this person's a**!\\" It's a great song and now I can understand why she loves it so much.<br /><br />5.

B004IFYMYI|5.0|Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a former Marine and a veteran of the Vietnam war. He frequently has trouble sleeping and is plagued by headaches. The pills he takes don't seem to help at all. Because he's likely to be awake all night anyway, Bickle takes a job driving a cab. He prefers the night shift.<br /><br />Scorsese's version of New York is gritty and realistic. Most of the film is shot at night and we see just how crazy some of the people are. It's a crime-ridden world populated by junkies and prostitutes. Bickle hates how much scum exists in the city, and he's referring to the people more than the dirty streets.<br /><br />Bickle is looking for something to brighten up his seedy existence and a woman catches his eye. Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) works in a local office for a senator who is hoping to become the next president. After pestering her for a while, she eventually agrees to go on a date with him. He talks to her in a very straightforward way. It's not clear whether he lacks intelligence, or if he doesn't see any point in hiding the truth about himself. His approach works and leads to one of the funniest scenes in the film when he takes her to see a movie.<br /><br />Other things attract Bickle's attention. He's particularly drawn to Iris (Jodie Foster), who is a 12-year-old prostitute. As his frustration mounts at the disgusting state of the city, he begins to devise a plan to clean up one small part. An incident on the street gives him the idea of saving Iris from her situation and giving her the opportunity to escape from her pimp (Harvey Keitel).<br /><br />It's interesting watching Bickle trying to escape his miserable existence. He figures out how to buy and use weapons and starts working out to strengthen his body. All the while, there's mounting tension, and we sense that Bickle is close to losing touch with reality completely.<br /><br />The supporting cast is strong, with Shepherd, Foster and Keitel all playing their parts well. You'll also see Peter Boyle and Albert Brooks. One of the most surprising scenes involves a cameo from Scorsese. His character might even be the catalyst for the change which eventually occurs in Bickle.<br /><br />I have to mention Scorsese's decision to shoot most of the scenes at night. It was an inspired choice and adds so much atmosphere to the film. Bernard Herrmann's saxophone-heavy score is also an important part of the mix and helps helps transport us into Bickle's troubled world.<br /><br />De Niro has produced some incredible performances over the past 40 years and Travis Bickle is probably my favorite De Niro character. There's so much going on beneath the surface and De Niro portrays much of it with his body language.<br /><br />The meaning of the conclusion is open to debate, but if you take it purely at face value, it's quite uplifting.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation adds a lot to the experience and is a must-own for fans of the film.Peter Boyle and Albert Brooks.

It's a fascinating (albeit fictional) glimpse into the minds of kids involved in the life of child who is ordinary on the inside but extra-ordinary on the outside.<br /><br />This is a tale of human struggle and of the power of kindness.  Truly inspirational and touching.

0525423656|3.0|I was pleased enough with Matched to pick this up although I'll admit it wasn't a priority, at least in part because the cover didn't please me (see below for my thoughts). I know that's shallow but there are SO many books and I need some system to help me sort. Anyway I've picked it up now, braced with very mixed opinions from the blogosphere although one point does seem to hold true: second books are hard.<br /><br />How much information should be revealed? How much character development can happen? How much of a character's wants will be fulfilled? Can the second book top the first? In this book, Cassia and Ky are separated in different locations in the Outer Provinces, both desperate to find each other. Overall I found it pretty boring and not a good second book.<br /><br />I think my main problem was Ky, who I grew to like less than Xander (originally I didn't feel much for either). I still don't understand their \\"love\\" that guides them through hardships. At least Cassia's interest is moderated by her feelings for best friend Xander, love for her family, and desire to fight the Society by joining the Rising. Ky only has Cassia. In fact, Ky's obsession to be the one chosen by Cassia and his willingness to sacrifice his anti-Rising principles in order to keep her from going to Xander rubbed me the wrong way (at least that was how I interpreted his stance in the closing chapters-maybe you felt a different way?)<br /><br />However I did take notice of the writing which was very lyrical and beautiful. Maybe a little too much as there were pages of such writing with nothing exciting happening. Some new characters were introduced but did not receive much development nor did I feel like Cassia or Ky's personalities were deepened more.<br /><br />Overall: Not a lot happens; recommended only for mega-fans of Matched.<br /><br />Cover: I really do not like this cover as much as that of Matched. I do appreciate the importance of the color blue and I like the idea of the heroine breaking free as it were. But this pose just looks so awkward to me and I especially find the legs weird. It does not look like she would have been able to break out there yet.roine breaking free as it were. But this pose just looks so awkward to me and I especially find the legs weird.

B000RZIGVS|2.0|The quality of manufacturing for this Box set is very poor--trays are cheap plastic & loosely held together; the video quality on this re-release is rather poor.  Some of the other reviews have made claims of pirating, but that is not necessarily the case.  MANY of the reviews from buyers with \\"Amazon Verified\\" purchases--meaning they bought directly from Amazon itself--have EXACTLY the same issues as those bought thru individual buyers.<br /><br />That is because this set is so poorly manufactured that it seems like it would be a fake copy even though it is completely authentic.<br /><br />My suggestion, is to buy the set the was released some time back that was better quality or to buy each season individually.  The individual seasons for TV shows are ALWAYS better than the reproduced Box Sets.  With the box sets, they always tend to cut corners to make the sets cheaper.<br /><br />The video quality on the individual seasons is also usually much better especially for true trekkies.  Bottomline: this particular set is not the best buy.

B007M6P01O|5.0|The Walking Dead is an adaptation of a graphic novel concerning the survivors that remain alive after a rampant virus decimates most of the population, turning those who died into flesh devouring zombies. We experience the daily struggle to find food, water, shelter, hope and other survivors, all while avoiding being tracked and attacked by the walking dead. This show is intensely dramatic, suspenseful, gritty, graphic and scary. An eerie, genius masterpiece. The characters are well defined and the production value is excellent. I love the way they carefully choose their color palette and frame shots to look as if they are jumping right off of the comic book page (graphic novel, technically.)<br /><br />Even if you are a person who doesn't necessarily like the thriller or horror genre please give this show a try. It's unique, it's cleverly scripted, produced and directed, and it's about the end of civilization as we know it, highlighting our will to survive. Scary, scary premise!<br /><br /> That was my review and these are my opinions! **SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />**Never having been able to decide whether or not I liked Andrea in the end she really turned out to be a hero...she is one tough woman. And what in the heck are those armless slave creatures?! Anyone have inside info on that?!<br />**I agree that Lori is a total two-face! What a troublemaker! More of a monster than some of the zombies!<br />**Having read the reviews about Carol and how she is kind of a 'nothing' character, I understand how some don't like her but I'm rooting for her. Poor Carol, she's a battered woman. Think of her piece-of-crap-husband and how mean he was. Do you remember HIM?-- remember in season 1 the day all the gals were down at the lake washing clothes and laughing for once? How he swaggered down there to stop it and the violent confrontation that occurred? (BTW-I never loved Shane more than I did at that moment!!!!) I felt so bad for Carol and was really pleased when hubby Ed bit thedust. Anyway it's part of her character now to be meek and quiet but I predict she will emerge as an important asset to the group in season three.<br />**I've ALWAYS thought Daryll and Carol were meant to be together and in the finale it just so happened that he turned out to be the one to save her. Then she chose to ride on the back of his bike even when the cars were available. Mmmm--Will they be an item?<br /><br />Let me say that I am sorely bummed out that it is over for now. I wish TWD was year-round. Can't wait for October.....
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was amazing! I loved it! Amazon recomenneded to me and I tried reading it. It takes place in the future after an alien attack when the government controls everybody's lives. It describes the story of Ender as he is used by the government as their tool. It makes you think and demonstrates a lot of cruelty, but isn't too dark at the same time. It's also really enjoyable to travel with Ender and try to solve the puzzles he faces. A really good read especially for people who like sci-fi. Also, you'll love it if you like Neil Shusterman. :)
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this for a new gaming PC I am building. I have the Intel i5-2500K (not overclocked...yet), and initally I just had the basic cpu fan that came with the processor. I wanted to test things out, so I ran BioShock on max settings. CPU temp occasionally spiked up to almost 80C (not good). Switched out the factory fan for this one and tried again. The temperature stayed around 38C and only spiked to over 40C for about a half a second at the beginning when you first pop out of the water. The fan is also really quiet considering the results. I ran a test on it that pushed it to max speed and it still wasn't really that loud compared to normal factory fans when they are working hard. The only thing is that it barely fit on the board with all the RAM slots full (I actually had to turn it the other way - facing the back of the PC instead - and wrap the ATX 12V cable around the outside of the fan). I got it in there, but it was a tight fit. Totally worth it though, and you certainly can't beat the price! Highly recommended.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|Let me start by saying I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these books!  This two star review is not for George Martin, but Amazon.  I don't like this e-version.  Three times now since starting this bundled series, my kindle has lost my place and I've had to re-navigate from the main page to try to figure out where I left off.  This is no easy feat due to the length of the series and how the Chapters don't coincide with the Chapter headings while you're reading. The bundle TOC lists #'s only without description. When you're reading, the Chapter #'s are not shown at the beginning of each chapter, only a name heading telling which character is being profiled.<br /><br />This coupled with the fact that Amazon doesn't use standard page #'s it's difficult to figure out where you were.  Right now I believe I am near the end of the 3rd novel, in the 48,863 range.  The dots at the bottom of my e-reader are almost 3/4 filled.  Several times now I've wished I just purchased the hardbound books.  This is my first experience with buying an e-bundle series and I would be hesitant to purchase another for fear they are all formatted like this.
0307719219|2.0|The most startling revelation provided by this book is the total disconnect between, on the one hand, the hype (see amazon page) and the credentials of the authors and, on the other, the actual delivered contents.  The first author has a chair at MIT and a John Bates Clark medal, the second has a chair at Harvard. But surely, please, not for this sort of thing.  They have one idea, which, in so far as it has any substance, is that 'extractive institutions are bad'.  They claim to find extractive institutions where bad things are, and not where good things are.  They don't actually provide a useful definition of what an extractive institution is, though they have a long list of places where things did not go well, which are supposed to illustrate 'extractive' situations, and places where things did go well as not.  This vagueness is sensible, because they apply the label to so many different things that there is no possibility that I could see of a useful operational definition.<br /><br />Of the many mangy hedgehogs I have encountered in 'one big idea' world history, this is surely the mangiest.<br /><br />They manage, for instance, to be confident that they can diagnose 'extractive' institutions in Mayan civilization and various neolithic arrangements in the middle east.  Their claims about the fine structure of political institutions in 2000BC in what was to become Syria, or where-ever it was, are on the basis of distributions of flint arrow heads and the like.  Never do they discuss (or even appear to stop to wonder) what, exactly, a non-extractive institution would look like in situations like this, or how you would distinguish it on the basis of the surviving archeological evidence.<br /><br />One thing I was interested to read to was their prognosis for China, but this boils down to very little more than 'China has bad institutions, which are bad because in the long term they won't allow the sort of creative destruction that an economy cannot avoid if it is going to continue to grow to rich nation levels of prosperity'.  Really?<br /><br />If you have read people like Mancur Olson, and your ideas about political economy and political sociology are even a little bit more sophisticated than what you can find in nerdy libertarian science fiction (or, come to think of it, than you can learn from full professors at MIT or Harvard), then there is no insight here worth stopping for that I could identify.  Not that I actually stopped for all four hundred-odd pages; after a while, I simply got tired ploughing through endless pages of low-content penny-a-word prose and started skimming more and more rapidly (even on its own terms, this is at most a hundred page essay, not a four hundred page book).<br /><br />For this level of insight I paid 14EUR?  Oswald Spengler is at least fun to read.<br /><br />P.S. [addendum that occurred to me after a recent evening run] This is not a history book.  The authors are not historians, and they do not think like historians (they are an economist and a political scientist); they have no interest in the past except to cherry pick examples to relate to the present.  This is essentially a disposable policy wonk essay blown up to a book, and all the hype is in policy wonk circles, not historian circles.  Its purpose is to reassure a specific class of policy wonks who are desperate to be reassured by what they see as figures of authority (MIT economist, Harvard political scientist), that, in spite of current pessimism, yes, liberal democratic capitalism is the best way to arrange a society, and it will prevail (that there is no Untergang des Abendlandes, if you like).  This may be true (I even think so - the first bit, at least), but this book makes no original or substantial case, it's just a (shallow, whiggish) sermon to the converted.  Interestingly, the authors even implicitly acknowledge that what they have written is a disposable policy wonk essay, since they chose to issue it in a 'business book' imprint, and not with Cambridge or Princeton University press, which is where they usually publish (or maybe CUP and PUP simply declined the offer).
B006MO0N6Y|4.0|This set is truly a fantastic bargain, and I am very grateful for the fact that it has made available some truly terrific performances -- but I am incredibly frustrated by its incompleteness! It's already 10 discs and has ALMOST everything Weissenberg recorded on EMI, so why not just add on a few more discs (increasing the overall cost just a little bit) and give his loving adoring fanatical obsessive fan-base what we're truly yearning for! EVERYTHING!<br /><br />This set does not contain the complete concerto recordings, but it features some solo recordings. I can pray there will be a supplementary set, completing the concerto recordings AND the solo recordings, but I find that highly unlikely. Whoever makes these decisions needs a stern talking-to.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|If there were 20 stars, it would be more suited. I LOVED THIS BOOK! If you are a fan of his work, you will definitely not be disappointed. He continues to amaze me with every book.  This book is wonderful. It is my favorite book of his. ABSOULTELY WONDERFUL! You will not be disappointed. Definitely worth the $$$! I lost sleep over this one. I just couldn't put it down. Most books that are wonderful always end the wrong way and leave me wanting more.... This one is perfect ( as are all of his other books). By far the best book he has written.
0553386794|5.0|This is the first book in a series of 5 (and hopefully more)and I purchased all.  An incredible tale set in medieval times that grabs you and never let go.  I was so impressed with the book that i bought the DVD set of the first season.  Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games series is absoultely remarkable. A great read however, I must caution parents... There is a maturity level that should be obtained and an open mind. I, myself would not let a 12 year old sit down with this book due to its content. It is a wonderful book for your 16 and up year old. You know if this book may put \\"ideas\\" in your child's head. I suggest you read the book first, then decide. A lot of parents are sceptical about the book. I recently saw the movie and the scenes in the book are more descriptive, should i say, in the book than the movie. It is definitely a wonderful read.<br /><br />Other than that, this book (and series as a whole) is amazing. I haven't read a series this captivating since HARRY POTTER. It left me begging for more. Wonderful book. Will instantly hook you. As as I did, you will probably lose sleep either reading it, or thinking about it. LOL! It is that wonderful, yes. Highly suggest this . Worth the money. I loved them so much, I actually bought the hard copy of all three books (: The book worm in me. Some books you just have to have hard copies of. (:
B000SJJCX4|3.0|good tuner gets the job done for the price. so what it's made of plastic, if you know how to use a pedal and not trying to slam it through the floor its fine. you will need a adapter just a standard 9volt will be fine.<br />the only gripe that I have is that it won't tune for crap down to B tuning.<br />easy to use letters are nice and bright really bright, if you don't tune down as low as I do sometime then this pedal tuner is for you. even though I don't use it anymore I still keep it around for if someone in the band needs a tuner.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it was a hit tricky but addicting. loved it. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a brain stimulating and fun game.
B0057UA486|3.0|You would THINK that warner brothers would consider having Barry Lyndon in its catalogue as a bit of a feather in its cap. No? Well, It has not cropped up via any second parry distributer, they have KEPT it! Plus warners must have catered to kubrick something awful during his lifetime... But now... all that is left is the fruit of that labor... And its being dismissed idiotically by the same company that bankrolled this picture to begin with. Now, I dont expect to find a wilted rose inside the cedar box that houses the disc... But I think displaying the film at its correct aspect ratio is ideal. They could have got some film historian to do the commentary for almost nothing had they tried. and lets not forget that the stanley kubrick archives is probably open to warners had they decided to pop in for twenty minutes and scan 12 or so items for a bonus feature. Its the greatest film kubrick ever made... And it looks like its fresh out of the bargain bin. I throw up in my mouth every time I see the sound of music sell for 80 bucks in a jumbo  set... or yawn inducing sword and sandal epics get the deluxe treatment... WHILE THIS FILM gets passed off as if it were a bonus feature on its OWN disc... But that makes no sense, This film HAS no bonus features. You get the idea. Completely worth the purchase... But shame on them just the same.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is decent but in order to get all 101 games you have to play the same games over and over
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have no idea how 267 people could have given this book only one or two stars. That tells me there is something wrong with the world.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is undeniably 5-star fiction. It is well-written, thought-provoking, and dripping with suspense. How can anyone not love a book that's as entertaining as it is insightful?<br /><br />This book gets you thinking about many of the problems with present day society. It makes you analyze your own place in the world and question whether you aren't just as silly and callous as the residents of the Capitol District.<br /><br />You will become emotionally involved with the well defined characters in The Hunger Games. You will cry, several times. And you will emerge a wiser, hopefully better, person.<br /><br />Sure, dystopian futures are being done to death, but this one gets it so very, very right.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a good book to read for pure enjoyment. It held your attention, made you want to get right back to it when you got interrupted, & made you rush to read the ending. I would recommend this book.
0071762345|5.0|Full disclosure: I work with Dave. It's awesome.<br /><br />As you might expect about a person who works at Likeable Media, I'm a huge social media nerd. I read absolutely every social media book, article and case study I can get my hands on. The unfortunate thing about that is that there's a tendency to repeat what's already been said and regurgitate old information and bore the pants off of everyone. There have actually been a couple instances where I've cracked open a social media book, read a few lines and put it aside in case I was having trouble falling asleep later.<br /><br />I didn't have that problem with Dave's book. It was informative and interesting and did a great job of incorporating old marketing ideas with new ones. Even in instances where the book was explaining something I felt I already knew about, it did so in a way that I didn't get the urge to kick back in my snuggie and take a nap. I instantly wanted to go check out every example in the book to see first hand how certain brands are doing amazing things in the social media world.<br /><br />Oh, and in case you're the CEO of a start-up with just about zero spare time on your hands, fear not- it's a fast read.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Simply put, MDNA is amazing.  I am not sure that \\"Give me all your Luvin\\" and \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" were necessarily the ideal first singles.  They are fun and catchy but not nearly the best songs on the CD.  \\"Love Spent\\" (perhaps my favorite track), \\"Masterpiece\\" (which won the Golden Globe), \\"I don't Give A\\",  \\"I'm a Sinner\\", and \\"Turn up the Radio\\" sound like perfect radio hits.  \\"Superstar\\" is fun and a bit retro, in the spirit of  \\"Cherish\\".  \\"Falling Free\\" is gorgeous - very similar to the numbers on the album \\"Ray of Light\\".  Lastly, \\"Gang Bang\\" - while maybe not the most commercial choice for a single - is stunning and could provide for an epic music video!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and purchase the deluxe edition.  The extra tracks are definitely worth owning.  \\"Beautiful Killer\\" is especially strong.  \\"I F***** Up\\" is so sweet, except for the title! I also really like \\"B-Day Song\\", which references Sonny and Cher.<br /><br />MDNA is that rare album which really has no filler.  It gets better with each track!<br /><br />Overall, this is a musical experience with many moods styles, and even some profound lyrics underneath all the sonics and beats.  MDNA proves without question that Madonna is still the Queen of Pop - and not interested in relinquishing her throne.<br /><br />Lawrence
B004XTWRYQ|4.0|Jackdaws is an exciting espionage thriller set in World War II with a bit of a twist: it's about a team of British spies operating behind enemy lines, who are all women (including a couple of lesbians)...well, and one German transvestite.<br /><br />The heroines are very interesting (particularly the transvestite), but Follett's greatest achievement in this novel is perhaps his villain, a German interrogator in charge of rooting out and breaking up the French resistance.  He is not averse to using extreme brutal torture to extract information if necessary (and there is some very graphic violence in the novel, but with the Nazis as a subject that's pretty much inevitable), but he is extremely intelligent and would rather use trickery or emotional manipulation when those methods would serve the purpose.  In fact, he finds the methods of his fellow Nazis rather distasteful.<br /><br />At the same time, Follett portrays the lead heroine, Flick, as somewhat cold and steely, willing to kill the enemy in cold blood to protect her mission.  Many writers today would use this juxtaposition to insinuate that the Nazis weren't such monsters as they are often made out to be and that the Allies were just as brutal and vicious.  But in Follett's hands, the Nazi interrogator's supposed \\"scruples\\" are clearly rank hypocrisy which only serves to highlight the atrocious nature of the ends he pursues and the means he employs, while Flick's actions are underlain by a righteous determination not to suffer the guilt which rightly belongs to the aggressors against whom she fights.  Very well done.<br /><br />Kate Reading's narration of this audio edition is excellent, bringing out the emotional depths of Follett's story.  I would definitely recommend it.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|The title almost kept me from watching this movie, however after hearing some good feedback about it, I decided to rent it.  I found this movie to be more a story of redemption (for Tony), and grace and forgiveness (for Det. Bowden) than a horror movie about the devil.  I enjoyed it so much I decided to buy it - the movie was delivered prompty and in great condition.
B00008LKDY|5.0|BESIDES THE FOUR SEASONS RELEASED UNDER LINN SACD THIS ALSO GETS 10 IN PERFORMANCE AND SOUND. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT A MAN THAT COMPOSED MORE THAN 500 VIOLIN CONCERTOS IS PLAYED IN MOST HOMES ONLY WITH THE FOUR SEASONS CONCERT THEREFORE MISSING BETTER CONCERTOS LIKE THE ONES IN THIS DISC.PODGER IS SUPERB.BUY IT ON SACD.I FIND THE PERFORMANCE MORE ENGAGING THAN NEVILLE MARRINER'S RENDITION AND ITS SOUND IS A 6-7 ON THE REGULAR FORMAT 1975 RECORDING.
B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA is just about everything you could want from Madonna in 2012: Dark, thrilling, fun, silly, textured, dizzying, diverse, ridiculous, poppy, edgy, catchy, forward-thinking and yet classic, highly personal and very dancefloor ready.<br /><br />Those that continue to attempt writing this woman off as 'over' will have egg on their faces yet again as she has proven for 30 years now that she just can't be counted out. She is a creative powerhouse who shows zero intention of 'going quietly into the good night' and we, and pop music, are all the luckier for it.<br /><br />Girls Gone Wild - fun, radio tune. Madonna doing Madonna.<br /><br />Gang Bang - dark and ridiculous and compelling. Retro and yet future and somehow pop. A strange beast.<br /><br />I'm Addicted - a Godzilla of a club stomper, destroying everything in its path. Very good for city night driving.<br /><br />Turn Up Your Radio - instant, sweet classic, like a modern Borderline. A girl calling to you from your radio, to forget your cares. Sun roof open, now drive.<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin' - a purely fun pop song, marred by the cheerleader bit which seems chosen only to tie in to her Super Bowl appearance. Aggressively uncool which I find cool.<br /><br />Some Girls - a real grower. A rare album track where Madonna's voice takes a back seat and gets sliced and diced which makes it initially off-putting.<br /><br />Superstar - sweet and retro. Madonna at her girlies is not my favorite Madonna so I skip this a bit.<br /><br />I Don't Give A - an interesting combo of Stevie funk and grungy rock. Interesting musical choices but not always in the mood for this one.<br /><br />I'm A Spinner - took a few listens but now I get this one. Catchy, 60s pop with a really, really good vocal from Madonna if you listen for it.<br /><br />Love Spent - just... Amazing. Gorgeous. Instant classic. And apparently, Madonna has at last broken her silence on she and Guy's divorce proceedings. Ouch.<br /><br />Masterpiece - lovely. She is a great studio singer for this type of ballad.<br /><br />Falling Free - Easy Ride meets Gone meets Has To Be. Tracks like this prove that Madonna is an artist.<br /><br />Love all the bonus tracks but see why they weren't part of the basic album!<br /><br />This record rewards repeated listenings and 'Love Spent' is nothing short of astonishing.<br /><br />There is MADONNA. And there is........................................... the rest.<br /><br />Take notes, class. You have been schooled yet again by the Master.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|this series is very true to the books, and incredibly well done.  the acting is superb as well as the set and costume design.  it feels more like a full length film then just tv.  the only thing i dislike about the series is the gratuitous nudity and sex.  i'm all for a love scene but watching 2 girls finger each other is a bit more like porn to me than a movie.  if the sex can be overlooked i would recommend this to anyone interested in the medieval.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|When I saw this book, I was incredibly excited, just to be disappointed. I was hoping for more. Much more. For me, it just didn't keep up with the rest of the trilogy. The Hunger Games and Catching Fire were amazing and I expected the same from this. Didn't happen. I'd still read it if you're absolutely dying to find out what happens next, but you might not find it as exciting.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great implementation on the kindle fire.  A super tool for when you want to show stuff to someone who is standing nearby.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As my title suggests, I have read this trilogy before.  And every time I read them, they just get better and better!! Catching Fire is my favorite book of the three.  I find this one to be loaded with surprises and awesome characters.  Finnick Odair has to be my second favorite character in the trilogy (Peeta is number one).  And I love Johanna Mason as well.  Shes not afraid to speak her mind.  Anyways, I highly recommend this book!!!!
B002BWP49M|1.0|I can suspend disbelief like a champ, but for this movie you have to suspend a lot more than disbelief.<br /><br />The whole series has been a public service announcement for abstinence and against pre-marital sex, but as soon as you're married violent sex is okay, I guess. Getting rough in the heat of passion is one thing, but leaving bruises is unacceptable in my book. Then comes the part that really stretches disbelief. We know Edward's skin is cold to the touch because he is DEAD after all... never mind how Bella could stand making love to a man cold as a corpse, or have part of that cold corpse inside her vagina and remain aroused... the unbelievable part is that she becomes pregnant from the encounter!<br /><br />We have to assume that Edward's spermatozoa remained alive for over a hundred years inside his body after his death.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The best game ever. My son loves this game and so do I. I will recommend it to all my friends.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very very addictive especially if you have OCD or an addictive behavior. I spend way too much time playing. It's like reading a good book. Sometimes my device has to die before I stop playing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it deserves 5 stars because its free.Keep in mind that this a wii game so if you want this game for free you can get it as a app.
B004EPZ03Y|4.0|It's time to put on makeup. It's time to light the lights. It's time to meet the Muppets ... After a decade in absence, The Muppets are back and it was well worth the wait. All our favorites are back.... Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie and new Muppet Walter whom I really like though I don't understand how he's Gary's brother and the film mysteriously doesn't seem to care to explain it not that it matters though because Walter is the catalyst for the story which is basically gathering the gang back together to save the Muppet theater from being torn down from an oil tycoon. So essentially you get The Muppet Show on the big screen with Statler and Waldorf their usual self.<br /><br /> A fun movie throughout  with many catchy songs and dance numbers,. I would absolutely recommend this movie to any fan of the Muppets and even if you aren't one. Who can resist Kermie, Piggie and especially Gonzo... I look forward to the sequel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there is a wide variety of games that make this app fun and exciting.  you get to unlock new games with points that you've earned, making the game more competitive.
B007BFZGAG|5.0|Listen to it several times through.  If you're a fan of hip hop get it.  This album has some songs I would say are random but music is music and everyone will have a hundred different impressions from the same song.  Don't listen to other reviews until you have listened to it yourself even try to Youtube some of the tracks and see if you like it.  Snips of the song offers DO NOT DO ANY ALBUM JUSTICE.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Guillermo del Torro brings a special Spanish depth to this Cat Tale. I only wish the bit of milk-licking \\"I am still thirsty\\" was included. Antonio Banderas is purr-fect as Puss in Boots, inimitable; all the cast does a great job. This is where all the talented artists are going, creating new worlds of imagination and beauty. Forget the pretensions of \\"art experts.\\" This is where it's at, a beanstalk flying into the sky, fine feline dance-moves to fun music, and kittens chasing moving light. What a delightful achievement. We hope there's more Puss in Boots inspiration to come, beyond \\"The Three Diablos.\\" I only wish the complete scene where Puss declares, \\"I am still thirsty\\" had been included in the film.
B004SMDJ9U|3.0|Would like to know when season 2 of the Haven, coming in DVD set, NOT INSTANT VIDEO?<br />cAN'T DESCRIED THESE ITEM BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIT
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I'm going to start out by saying that I've been hearing about these books from everyone. Between working at a book store and my friends talking about it I had heard enough about the series to be convinced to jump on the bandwagon. I read the book in two sittings. It took two sittings because the writing style is such a mess I was ready to just give up on reading the book all-together. Suzanne Collins came up with this idea and planned everything out but it's as if she rushed through the actual writing process. Her writing style is bland and everything is to be accepted at face value. Nothing is detailed and it kept jumping from one thing to another. While the first half of the book was hideously slow  the second half was a bit more intriguing, but by that point the book had fallen so far behind it was unable to carry its weight. With better writing this book could have been excellent. This is by far the most shallow, horribly written book with little substance or emotional depth. Each page contributed to large amount of disappointment and hatred that I hold towards this book.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|every time I clicked on it. it would crash within minutes and I couldn't even buy anything from the store because it gltched
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I truly appreciate apps like this.  When you click on hotels and look at the pictures others have posted, you will be surprised at the wide veriety of peoples choice pics!  Some do not hesitate to take pictures of hotels that are just downright nasty, to people who take some of the most lovely pictures you'll ever see. Overall this is very helpful in making decisions on trips.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|This book is set in a fantasy city that is described as being very much like Venice. Most of the city is on many islands with a network of canals around them. (The Kindle edition contains a map, but I have head the printed version does not? That's a little strange.) It's an interesting city to be sure and Lynch's descriptions are very well thought out.<br />The main protagonists are thieves, but not the common kind that you find in Fantasy novels. These are are more like con men who pull of elaborate schemes in the style of 'The Sting' or 'Oceans 11'. It's an clever twist to an old theme and cleverly written. The pace of the book picks up half way through as the thieves become involved in something they had not anticipated. Not going to say what here.. go out and read it for yourself, I think you will enjoy it.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Mind blowing ideas come from this book and I won't spoil the premise but if you REALLY follow the daily recommendation your life will change. I recently finished the book and have started to incorporate some of the wonderful ideas. I also gave my physical copy to my Mom who is having some health issues. I think this book is great to give her a daily dose of positive, enpowering ideas and allows her to heal both mentally and physically. I'm thrilled with this book and it's complete focus on being grateful. An amazing concept and life changing.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|The case is awesome, totally worth the money.  It fits snugly on the kindle, but is not too hard to get off if you need to take it off for some reason.
B004QSYSZ0|3.0|We purchased this roundhouse for our 2.5 and 4.5-yr-old train-enthusiasts for Christmas.  It's a fun toy but it has some issues.<br />First the pros: Stacking roundhouse and rising turn-table are a big hit with the kids.  The opening/closing doors to all the roundhouse bays are fun for the kids.  The roundhouse both stacks or sits side-by-side on the ground.  It has tracks that run on top of the roundhouse which is a fun addition to the roundhouse-concept.  It's also brightly colored and looks pretty Chuggington-authentic.<br />Cons: Compatibility.  I am a professional architect and have engineered some pretty complicated tracks for my kids, but this roundhouse gives me headaches.  The risers needed to get to the level on top of the roundhouse are taller than anything sold by supposedly compatible sets.  You basically have to buy the chuggington-specific riser set to go with this (which we did not do since at the time we didn't want to spend another $35).  It seems like the set should come with a couple risers.  Also, the angles of the turn-table and roundhouse make it nearly impossible to connect multiple tracks to it without running into issues.  It's like it's about half of a curve off.  Usually, I am able to find some work-around, but the point of these toys is not for the grown-ups to agonize over construction, but for the kids to learn about track-building/engineering.  My kids definitely struggle to make the roundhouse work with their other pieces and usually it ends up sort of semi-connected, off in a corner.  Every other kid who's come over to play has had similar struggles.<br />The kids love this toy, so in that regard, I would definitely recommend it if you have Chuggington fans and maybe haven't made a huge investment in other wooden train sets like we have, but just be aware when you purchase it that while it says it's compatible, you will run into some troubles using other sets or brands with it.  If I had it to do over again, I would have spent the same amount of money buying a kidkraft (or similar) set of non-character-related pieces that would have equally enriched our collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this book on the Today show last week. It piqued my interest, so I had to get it. WOW! Am I glad I did! I actually could not put it down! This is the first novel I have read with characters so intense, I had to read on... I read all three books in the trilogy in ONE week! They are all great! I am a virgin to the concepts in the story...the scenes made me blush! But, the author weaves the story so well, you learn very quickly how to deal with such embarrassment! Bravo!
0439023513|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Hunger Games and Catching Fire, but Mockingjay is so far away from the other two it's dissapointing. The love story fades away and nothing makes sense anymore. It was hard to even keep reading because the more pages I turned the more depressing the story became all the way to the dissapointing and forgettable ending. I can't even call it a conclusion because nothing was concluded. Who the heck is Paylor? What happend with katniss's mother? What about Gale? What about Panem? She didn't even give Katniss's kids names other than 'the boy' and 'the girl'. Did Collins suffer from depression while writing this or did she not even give a crap about the story anymore? Its like she had a plan during the first two books and then when it was time to wrap it up she had a brain fart. My advice is to read the first two books in this trilogy and then make up your own conclusion, cause whatever you come up with it'll be better than Mokingjay.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app ia awesome I just luv it. this app has the best games u can get u would love to have this app
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I don't like this game at all. it isn't fun and it is really really really stupid and a waste of time! the games in it are so stupid and dumb.

0374275637|5.0|ecellent book a must read for everyone in marketing and also pick up the authors other books too ! you won't regret it either
0446573019|4.0|Just a glance at the reviews told me I'm not the only one who thinks this is a bit of a copycat novel. It's good and I'm enjoying it  (halfway through) but this is Jack Reacher using the phony name John Puller. The Army. Brother. Raised around the world. Drinks coffee. Wake up with an internal alarm clock. Speaks very little.<br /><br />If you like Reacher books, you'll like this.<br /><br />I mean, it's good. It's just NOT original.
B007LEC7CC|1.0|This has to be the most uninspired Madonna album of her career.  While aiming for back to roots, it ended up a bland, generic trashy pop album.  It is hardly the pioneering, cutting edge work we saw in Ray of Light.  In an era of DJ infused beats and house driven remixes, this falls short of anything remotely creative.  It begs for a modern-day DJ remix version of just about every song.  She never could carry a note, but her music was always saved by cheap controversial sexcapades or good producers.  She lacks real talent like Lady Gaga who can actually sing and play piano.  Give Me All Your Luvin is about as talent drive as Mickey by Toni Basil. If bubble gum pop is considered cutting edge, these reviewers need their heads examined.  Madonna should either show maturity in her talent or exit gracefully from the scene. I would have thought she would use her years pop experience would have lead her to newer, creative heights rather then a simplistic back to basics.  There are so many cool DJs out there now which she could have teamed up with to cultivate a new DJ house infused pop album. This is a bland waste of money with songs that will fizzle out after a few radio rounds.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very cool app. I like it because it has so many different games in one app. keep it up.
067144901X|5.0|I bought this for my almost 18 month old daughter because she loves animal sounds.  She loves this book and makes sounds along with it.  Great board book for the little ones.
B007MLDC2I|1.0|Could not watch more than 15 minutes of this, I was left wishing for subtitles like in the Swedish version so I could follow the dialog, very poor quality
B0052YAKS6|4.0|My friend turned me onto David Guetta's new album... I loved it so much I bought a copy for my niece Leah...<br /><br />My fav traces are Chris Brown's \\"I Can Only Imagine\\" & Usher's Without You. This Album is a gr8 party mix album...<br /><br />xxoo
B00756GKBA|1.0|Her last CD \\"Hard Candy\\" might not have been a big seller but it had at least there was a Touch of Madonna in the songs.This Cd is everything she claims Lady Ga Ga did to her (stealing riffs and sounds) It sounds like one Long remix song -IMHO- no feeling of HER input, might as well just be a \\"Producers/D.J. release -I will always Bow to her for her early work and creations -
B0064MT1LM|4.0|Like The English Patient .. i loved this movie too. With 7 nomination oscar very good enough for buy this edition . Transfer picture is amazing clean and sharp 4/5 . with DTS HD 5.1 to make war look so real 5/5 . But the Feature like dvd version 3/5 . if you have this dvd maybe you dispointed with feature. but if you liked transfer picture and sound perhaps you can buy if the price right ( lowest prices )
B005723JSQ|5.0|A must read by Sophie Kinsella.  Like all her books, light, fun and humorous.  Really hard to put it down till you've read the last page.
B0017HPHBM|5.0|i love this movie.. why i buy this dvd edition ? because transfer bluray version not good enough. I think WB want to release Trilogy of Batman Nolan. With card and USB and other bonus makes this edition sepcial for me
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I downloaded and tested every known mobile WiFi monitoring app there was and tried them all for a period of time before landing on Wi-Fi Analyzer. It has the basic features I seem to use a lot and it works very well. Having a dedicated analog signal meter is also another useful feature to have, and Wi-Fi Analyzer is one of the only (if not THE only) mobile app that has this particular feature. Additionally, the Channel Rating feature is also useful for those who really need to know the best available channel for their device and I personally find myself using this feature a lot for ANY 2.4 GHz installation, and I know numerous professional installers of wireless products that utilize this app on their phones for general measurement purposes. It works THAT well.<br /><br />Whether it's a router, wireless video camera or cordless phone issues, Wi-Fi Analyzer is an excellent, FREE wireless utility that lets you do much more than most any other WiFi app's out there today. This is one of the few applications that I give five full stars to because it's one of those that work extremely well and then some.<br /><br />Well worth having for both casual use and even professionals alike. And being FREE is that much better :)
B00756GKBA|5.0|As a longtime Madonna fan, I've been moved,inspired and touched by Madonna's music, concert performances,interviews,movies and videos.... There is not one pop artist, male or female, at least in my opinion, that can still create excitement over a new CD or venture like Madonna.... At 53 years old she continues to amaze me with her energy and enthusiasm and talent... While I liked Hard Candy, it didn't take me on the journey I was expecting.... With MDNA, Madonna is once again doing what she does best....I am so in love with this record.... The music is infectious,addictive and most importantly enjoyable.... Every track is great, while some are simply slices of sheer brilliance.... Trust me,this record is fabulous, and as Madonna sings, just listen and \\"Turn up the Radio\\"!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I truly wish Amazon had a zero star option. I read this book because I saw a story on the Today show about it and the controversy peaked my curiosity. Well, what a waste of money this turned out to be. This book had a terrible, unbelievable plot, poor character development and it contained some of the most redundant language I've ever read. If I never read about lip biting again it will be too soon. I cannot believe I wasted hours of my life on this piece of trash. If you want a smutty book Amazon has tons of them, most of them are cheaper (or even free) and won't make you want to bash your head against the wall, like this one did me. Do yourself a favor, don't buy into the hype like I did, read a synopsis and move on to better books, god knows you're unlikely to find any worse.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This was a fast download. It is a great game and this version is free! I am very satisfied with this app!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|why is this game 299 on my kindle fire but free on my phone,doesn't make sense but other than that its an amazing game
B0063GORYU|4.0|this is a great solitaire game. the game gives hours of pleasure with just enough wins to keep you playing. it cannot be beat.
0143037757|4.0|I have read more or less half of the book. I am learning a lot reading it, the author faced a very difficult task trying to sumarize a lot of history and information into one book and I think he did it very well. The only bad commentthat I could point out is the fact that the author skip some information about the most outstanding facts of history. For example Berlin blockade and Schuman declaration (two topics I found particularly interesting) deserve no more than 1-2 pages. The book is very well written and the style is very direct.
B003EYVXV4|3.0|I liked the movie.  I saw it twice in theaters--and when the DVD comes out this August I plan to buy it.<br /><br />But I got sea sick watching the movie.  Two hours and twenty-two minutes of fuzzy focus channel surfing by trembling cameramen made \\"The Hunger Games\\" hard to watch.  Motion picture cameras are NOT cocktail shakers, people!  The number of cuts per minute must have shattered some records, too.  Like I said, channel surfing by drunk camera operators...<br /><br />Rue's death scene in the movie is fare better than what I imagined from reading the book.  The interveiw segment with Katniss and her red dress was special.  The screen showed a better \\"girl on fire\\" than I imagined from reading the book.  It's a worthwhile movie--marred by vibrating images.  The artistic decision to shake the camera detracted from the scene when Katniss suffers jacker tracker hallucinations because the images already suggested that the audience was intoxicated.<br /><br />It can't be fixed now--but perhaps the director and editor will pay attention to my lone voice and use better camera techniques for the release of \\"Catching Fire\\" in November 2013.
B007M6P01O|5.0|I love the walking dead and all of its characters. Lori, carl and carol I love your characters as well. You can be a bit annoying with all the back talk and fit throwing but you have good spirits and great potential. Hopefully carl will start to grow out of his boyish attitude in the next season.<br /><br />The characters are true to how it would actually be. Not everyone would be heros. We have a plethora of opinions and personallities and its hard to get a long but when it comes right down to it you'll do anything for eachother. That my friends is a family and that is what this group is. In Season 2 the fear is still there but their in denial and they are trying to find some kind of normalcy in their lives. Unfortunately, they didn't do enough to keep the walkers out of the farm. They had provisions and a way to survive the winter but that was not enough. I cant wait for season 3. I wish they ran episodes all year long.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I think this.is.the best angry bird game yet. With the space levels, and the new birds. It's great, but people.should stop complaining, three dollars is not much compared.to a nintendo game, it's the perfect price for a awesome app like this. Best app ever.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Great literay video,lines,story and cinema presentation was exellent. The acting was great and the capture of the period mentallity was enlightening. The picture quality was execellent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i like all the card backs, backgrounds, and the one touch insyesd of dragging. if you like solitaire, i really recommend this one :)
0805047905|1.0|This book was not what I expected.  I wanted the BIG book.  I am an educator and I wanted the book for the end of the year program for my class.  This happened to be a board book. THE BOOK ITSELF IS FINE! I JUST WANTED THE BIG VERSION!  I MESSED UP! :(
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I just want to rate this book, I don't want to review it. I borrowed this book from the libary and really liked it.
B00009MGR6|3.0|AC/DC keeps with their formula...you like them, tolerate them or hate them, but you know what you are going to get with them - ROCK!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! It truely makes reading the Bible easy with the &quot;my plan&quot; option. I recommend it greatly!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I heard about this novel on NPR and couldn't wait to download it.  It was an absolutely wonderful book and I couldn't put it down!  It's definitely a tear-jerker in all the right ways.  I recommend this book to everyone.
B0054JELS4|4.0|The item was in good condition, the only thing I didn't like was that in some discs you can't see the \\"special features\\", also the set of season 5 had a little trouble with the information because there were 6 discs with all the episodes in different places and no \\"special features\\".  But as a whole thing, it is good.
0385342063|4.0|I enjoyed this book but not as much as her other books. That is not to say that I didn't read the book every free chance I had, because I did! It just wasn't as good as her other books. It was an enjoyable read that had me laughing at parts, sighing at parts, and even on the edge of my seat at parts.<br /><br />Poppy Wyatt was a difficult character for me to either like or dislike. There were moments I really liked her and I was on her side. There were other moments where I thought she was playing down to her intelligence and did not appear to be a strong woman. For example, the whole Scrabble game...I loved that Sam helped her via text message. That cracked me up because I could see the looks on her future in-laws faces when she threw out some of the words! However, her narrative had just as many big words...she knew words to play but she didn't...she psyched herself out because she thought she was not as good or as smart as her future in-laws. That bugged me.<br /><br />Sam Roxton was a good character. I got him. He was likeable even when he was disagreeable. I rooted for him. I admired his dedication and devotion and patience. He was my favorite character. Magnus Tavish and the Tavish family - UGH! I did not like any of them. I could not find a redeeming quality in any of them...at all. And since Magnus was Poppy's fiance, that was difficult for me to picture.<br /><br />The footnotes really bothered me. They were unnecessary and really disrupted the flow of the book for me (especially since I was reading on my Nook). It was almost as if the parts that were edited out of the original manuscript were put into footnotes because the author didn't want those parts on the cutting room floor. However, some of the footnotes would have read so much better had they been left in the story where the footnote was located. Also, the footnotes were practically nonexistent towards the last third of the book. It felt like the author didn't want to bother with them any more. For me, if you are going to use footnotes, use them throughout the whole book or, better yet, leave them out altogether.<br /><br />Would I recommend it: If you are fan of Sophie Kinsella's book, then absolutely! If you haven't read any of her previous books, I would not recommend that you start with this one. Wait until you've read a few others first.<br /><br />Will I read it again: Perhaps, but not anytime soon.<br /><br />[...]use footnotes, use them throughout the whole book or, better yet, leave them out altogether.

B000MCIBB6|2.0|When my \\"gold\\" audiophile CD of this album came up missing, I logged on to buy another, took one look at the price, and shrieked. Then I noticed that they'd reissued a gold version for a better-than-reasonable price, so I ordered it. After listening to portions of three songs, I slipped it back into its case, logged back on, and performed a diligent search for an affordable copy of the first gold audiophile edition. Then I realized that I like this album enough to go ahead and pay good bucks for a clean copy.<br /><br />And by \\"clean\\" I mean one that's been mastered with the kind of care worthy of this, one of my all-time favorite records.<br /><br />If you're 12 (like I was when this album first came out), then you'll prolly appreciate what they've done to the regular remastered edition, the extra things they've added to the sequence and such. But when I was 12 (and for many years since) I played this album again and again until every nuance was permanently etched into my psychedelicized soul. And that's the only way I can really appreciate it. If you don't have the original album permanently inscribed into your very being or if this is the first edition you've ever laid ears on, you'll prolly love the new one as much as I love the old one. But if the old version of any album has grown to mean something to you, then I strongly recommend sticking with original copies of the LP and early releases of \\"two-track master\\" audiophile recordings.
B007FH9GT2|1.0|We saw the original Swedish trilogy and this new release doesn't even deserve to have the same title.  The original goes into so much more depth than the time alloted for the U.S. version that it lets the story unfold.  If we hadn't seen the original we would have been lost for the story was so chopped up that it barely made any sense.  If you have the time see the original trilogy - - if not don't waste your time.  I purcahsed both copies of this story from amazon.com and knowing what I know now would not recommend the new version to anyone.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Let's face it, we're paying a $2 Kindle Fire tax on this app.  This is completely uncalled for -- Amazon is charging extra because Fire owners are locked into the app store for game purchases.<br /><br />The free version works on my phone just fine, but that's not even an option on my Fire -- I really don't care about the ads at all, I understand that's part of using a free app, but I don't get that option on my Fire.  I can't even pay the $1 that everyone else pays, because I bought a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Thanks a heap, Amazon.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|very fun game kind of like the regular cut the rope but its better and its very entertaining for long car rides
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I really enjoy this game, but it gets real laggy if I play for more then two minutes. 5 star rating if it ran smoothly.
0439023513|2.0|I enjoyed the The Hunger Games and Catching Fire quite a bit, and the tension that was built over the course of those two books was palpable.  But it completely dissipates early on in Mockingjay.  While the first two books were paced similarly and effectively, Mockingjay languishes, despite times in the story when there is constant action.  All the characters are reduced to one dimensional versions of their former selves, and don't have a chance to be likeable in any way.  Instead of evolving and growing, it feels as if Collins throws everyone through the ringer JUST BECAUSE.  Challenges, crises, and hardship don't carry weight, or add to the characters at all.  It's almost as if a less talented writer had tried to pick up where Collins left off... and created a disaster. The world that was previously created, rich and full of details, reveals itself to be paper thin, as events occur that seemingly defy logic, and societies become as superficial as a alien species du jour on an episode of Star Trek. I respect that Collins tried to craft a story that didn't wrap up so nicely and neatly as people would hope.  And that the lines of morality become blurred.  But instead of making characters flawed and human and sympathetic, everyone ends up feeling arbitrary and devoid of motivation.  Also, by this point, we've seen Katniss be weak, and physically destroyed and comatose and clinging to life so many times that the half dozen other times she goes through those states in this book gets older than old.  And there is absolutely no payoff.  All the plotlines, the romance, the drama, the development... all go down the drain.  I had to force myself to finish the book just so i could say that I completed it.  If you pick up this book, which if you've read the previous two you will, be prepared to read it just to finish it.  But don't expect any closure.  And if you can, hold out and see if the movie that they inevitably make will be better.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|This is a creative and fun game.  I can play this on my HTC Incredible, but I am disappointed there is not a free version for the Kindle Fire.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my husband,& it was great! We watched it shortly after it arrived,& it was exactly what he wanted. Watching Firefly has made me more of a Sci-fi fan than I ever was before. Which is good,because my hubby loves scienec fiction!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think u should get this because it is a good game and u should get this for kids to they will like it 2
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|It was good until the end when her sister got blown to pieces.Also I had people very angry with me when I had read the book and did not tell them she ends up with Peeta.Over all the story died with the sister.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Somewhat similar to the previous in the series but a bit more interesting. Sadly not as cool as the 3rd.
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|It was an amazing show of Iron Maiden, I was there listening and screaming with the 50.000. In 2008 the \\"Estadio Nacional\\" was closed for reapiring, and Bruce told that Iron Maiden will come back to play at the Stadium... Iron Maiden delivered and with a great news, the will film the show. Do you know that Iron Maiden film the show in Buenos Aires Argentina and Santiago Chile? well.. now you can see that the Chilean show was the best and with the best audience.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad (kindle fire) cheap timesink. only con is how slow point accumulation is. without doing extra-game stuff like posting reviews.
B00701QVVY|5.0|I just wanted to be the first to say I didn't think it would be possible for OVERKILL to top Ironbound, but I believe the gutter crew has pulled it off.  The album starts out strong, and Blitz is in top form once again, but the album does have a few areas where momentum slips although not enough to sway my five star opinion.  This could be from the band saying, \\"how the hell are we going to play this live without our fingers bleeding and an anneurism\\", or maybe some age from the third decade the band has been playing is showing through....bottom line - who cares. Overkill carved a nich in thrash and metal through years of decay and Electro-violence!  The album is brutal from the staccato double bass to the ripping guitar attacks.  One metal site stated that the album repeats itself instead of individualizing each song, but The album does pick up again towards the end with Old Wounds, New Scars, etc.  That site also was comparing Overkill's current album to the \\"new\\" thrash out there, really?  Your joking.<br /><br />Just to keep it short Electric Rattlesnake was enough of a teaser for me to buy the album even if it was the best track which it is NOT!<br /><br />Cheers to Blitz, DD and the rest of the band!
B0013O123Q|3.0|The film is end to beginning; two extremely violent scenes, one involving a brutal rape; and then the film just continues backward to the beginning of three ordinary peoples lives.  Watch at your own risk.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the most used app on my Kindle Fire. I absolutely love it!  It has so many different games that vary by difficulty and enjoyability.
B001NLL8LA|2.0|I stewed over this review for a while. On the one hand, Mr. Childs knows all the tricks of a super suspenseful opening, the initial hook into action, and the devious means of drawing a reader into a story. Applause and good job!<br /><br />But once into the story, we get the cliched' apathetic police and inept thugs, relative who believes a murder has happened, the coincidence of another missing family member and his demise, all for what? A piece of information that should have been securely stored in top government systems [offline] and not accessible by a lowly clerical employee. Has the Pentagon not heard of encrypted file systems? How about logging and alerting of data access? How about private networks, firewalls, or \\"need-to-know\\" access control?<br /><br />The story drags from one investigation, set of suspicious characters to the next, has the obligatory one-night-stand that failed to elicit any sparks, and the expected mayhem. But the actual disposition of the object in question was a letdown. Wow... about as exciting as the slow drive and traffic jam on I-95 that was the inciting incident into the entire mess.<br /><br />About the most entertaining aspect of the story were the two villains with a fetish for cutlery. Oh, and did I mention that data on USB memory sticks can be easily copied? So why were the two villains focused on wanting the clerk to turn over that particular stick so they can destroy it?
B00009V7OR|4.0|Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Randy Quaid star<br />in this 1996 sci-fi film. Aliens invade Earth and the people<br />unite to fight back. I've always liked this film and this dvd<br />has nice picture and sound plus neat extras. This is a great<br />sci-fi flick with a good cast and cool effects. I recommend<br />this.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I have only used the SD adapter so far with my iPad 2.  This product was the missing link for my photography on the go.  Highly recommend spending the money and getting the real Apple product!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like the app , but I wish it were available offline,  without having to sign up for the membership.  The membership  just asks for too much personal info. I use it on my kindle fire, to listen to the Audio Bible, and it works pretty well :) I haven't signed up for the membership, and don't intend to. For now, I will use it while I am at home or near wi fi.
B00005NNMK|5.0|This is the best Europe album ever! The title song is their best known and best of theirs forever! All of these tracks on this CD are hits of theirs and it rocks! Overall this is an excellent CD and I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I watch a lot of movies, and for my money, 2011 was one of the worst years for film in ages. It wasn't that anything was bad, per se, just that it was kinda... meh. Just look at the Oscars. How many of those films will you truly be talking about/watching in 10 years time?<br /><br />The one film that made me sit up and take notice was Drive; I was literally giddy after seeing it. Would I have been as impressed any other year? Perhaps not - but we'll never know. 2011 was the year it came out, and that makes 2011 the year of Drive for me.
0307956350|5.0|One of the best books I have read in many, many months!  The character, Kate, is so believable that I had to look twice to be sure the author of this book is a male.  He captured everything about how his female protagonist thinks, feels, reacts, appears and on and on.  In the beginning, you will shake your head as Kate, because of her former CIA background, sees trouble behind her most of the time. No one is who they say they are, the apartment is bugged, as is the phone. Someone is always following her walking, driving behind her, lurking around the next corner - you'll be convinced that she is in an advanced state of paranoia.  Little do we know.  This story keeps you off balance and suspicious of everyone. Just when you think you know what's going on, the whole thing takes a twist that sends you off in another direction.  In the meantime, you are thoroughly enjoying your trip through the farmer's markets and art galleries of Paris, and other European locations.  You'll smell the flowers, hear the hum of conversations in French, taste the wine and feel yourself totally transported.  And, least you think that this is some kind of travelogue, let me assure you that this story delivers loads of chills, spills and thrills.<br /><br />I finished the book very reluctantly yesterday and, this morning, went looking for it.  I couldn't believe that my experience with the Moore family had come to a close.  I wanted it to go on and on!!  Isn't that the true test of a book - you just hate to see it end. And this was a debut! I can't wait for the author's next one!
B007KQXB2G|1.0|I bought this thinking it was Episode 1, not some strange lesson on sales. It's not even watchable and is just exploiting the brand. I love Mad Men so I didn't spend enough time reading other reviewers' comments.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is great I play it everyday ! I had it on my phone. first, butits better on the kindle.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a fun way to kill time with a virtual city. this is more fun than other apps with city.  I like playing. this game
B004T5K3OK|5.0|Quick and easy scanning on-the-go. I love that it can setup with my google docs account. You can even email straight from your phone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a great game that really has one hundred games. If you have a ds it has the same games. I recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun I could just scream over it! its absolutely awesomely fun I could play it all day long
B000JCSPG0|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies, its great, sci fi-love story, action, intruige. They dont make movies like this any more
B007IQX1G4|4.0|It won't make you feel great about the world, about your generation or about society in general, but it's an honest story and doesn't hide it's scars. As someone who grew up in a small city, moved to a bigger city and then came back, I could totally relate. Though I was more the Patton Oswalt character, rather than Theron's. Definitely not for everyone I suppose, but I say give it a chance.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|this product will change how you play the game. I bought it as a birthday present for my fiance, and within the first week he got his first MOAB. He couldn't believe how much influence being able to hear nothing but the game could fix his faults.
0062082353|5.0|Great book. Read many special forces books and this is one of the better ones I've come across. God bless our troops!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|You will get your moneys worth on this DVD set!  My Grand kids watch this DVD everyday. When they wake-up, the first words are ... CARS!!!<br />When we go on trips in the SUV with the entrainment system, they just keep playing that over & over again!!! No one is saying: \\"Are we There Yet\\"? And I have other DVDs to Play! We have a ball singing some of the tunes together.
0446582778|5.0|Angel's Flight is another wonderful thriller/mystery from Michael Connelly. Harry Bosch i called upon to solve the murder of a scummy civil rights attorney who made his living by suing cops. The books has wonderful plot twists and is interesting from start to finish. I just love Harry Bosch and Michael Connelly.

B00756GKBA|4.0|Madonna is a fascinating and complex woman, full of contradictions and virtues and vices. On her new record, her first in four years and her first since liberating herself from two powerful (and possibly oppressive) forces (Warner Brothers and Guy Ritchie), she seems less interested than ever in reconciling all of them. \\"MDNA\\" is a sonic portrait of a middle-aged global pop superstar embracing everything that she is.<br /><br />1. First and foremost, Madonna likes to get her boogie on. She's spent her career finding new and exciting ways to keep the world dancing, and MDNA's tracks are filled with inventive, head-spinning grooves.<br /><br />2. Madonna likes to experiment, always pushing the boundaries of how far pop music can go. The album's second track, \\"Gang Bang\\", is a dark revenge fantasy that sounds like a Quentin Tarantino film on ecstasy. The album closes with \\"Falling Free,\\" a beautiful, beat-less track that sounds like a showtune from another planet. Those are probably the most out-there songs, but her innovative spirit shows through on almost every tune.<br /><br />3. Madonna has a complicated relationship with religion. She's been talking about Kaballah for years, but \\"Girl Gone Wild,\\" \\"I'm a Sinner,\\" and \\"I Don't Give A ...\\" all name drop Catholicism and Christianity.<br /><br />4. Madonna is a romantic. Whether gushing about a new lover (\\"I'm Addicted\\"; \\"Superstar\\") or lamenting love gone bad (\\"Love Spent\\"), romantic love is never far from her mind. When she's not making dance tracks, she also has a long history of making poignant ballads like \\"Masterpiece\\", and it's often those times where her singing voice really shines.<br /><br />5. Madonna is resilient. Most of her contemporaries are either dead or have faded into obscurity. As a 53-year old mother of four, she's still selling out massive world tours, still rocking a body that most 20-year-olds would kill for, and still making albums that make some other of-the-moment pop stars look like amateurs.<br /><br />As Nicki Minaj says, \\"there's only one Queen, and that's Madonna.\\" Long live the Queen..<br /><br />As Nicki Minaj says, \\"there's only one Queen, and that's Madonna.\\" Long live the Queen.
B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA opens with the second worldwide single release, Girl Gone Wild. One of three tracks produced by the Benassi team, \\"Girl\\" starts the record with an upbeat Italian club-pop track that keeps the beats heavy while the lyrics are a bit too light for my liking.<br />Gang Bang and I'm Addicted move away from standard pop to an almost industrial, EBM sound. The bass is thick and heavy, the mood is dark, and Madonna is a woman scorned in a Tarantino flick in Gang Bang.<br />I'm Addicted also has elements of early 80's sounds from the likes of \\"Soft Cell,\\" mixed with early 90's techno elements similar to \\"Utah Saints.\\" In the middle breakdown, Madonna, gives a nod to her own track \\"Future Lovers\\" before the, Mika penned, track goes into hi-speed and shoots us into space while the pop icon chants \\"MDNA\\" over and over again.<br /><br />Arguably the biggest pop hit on the album, Turn Up the Radio was originally intended for Solveig's 2011 album, \\"Smash\\" and originally sung by \\"Sunday Girl.\\" Madonna, with her added touches, turns his original track into a fantastic sunny delight reminiscent of that mid 90's euro sound mixed in with current french house and the result is a feel good, summer club anthem for 2012.<br />Give Me All Your Luvin is not representative of anything we've heard so far on the record and may have been the worst song to pick to introduce MDNA. On the album itself, \\"Give Me\\" fits like a glove and segues perfectly from \\"Turn Up the Radio,\\" to maintain the high energy of the first part of the album, to lead into the less pop/dance next section.<br /><br />Some Girls marks a clear shift from the dancier euro metallic tech-house of the first section to a more, raw, electro, NY early 80's vibe with Blondie style vocal verses and for the chorus.  To be honest, I was expecting much more from a Klaas and Madonna collaboration.<br />Superstar is a simple pop track, in the vein of old pop style hits like \\"Cherish\\" and \\"True Blue.\\" The track receives background vocal assistance from none other than M's daughter, Lourdes but doesn't seem to \\"fit\\" on the album.<br />I Don't Give A takes us back to Madonna rapping, American Life style, on a beat that sounds somewhat amateurish and unrefined. The track would have been mostly filler except for the slightly more substantial lyrics while Nicki Minaj comes in and does a great job taking the track where it needed to go. Before the track ends with a full minute dramatic instrumental, Nicki Minaj claims, \\"There's only one Queen, and that's Madonna...\\"<br /><br />The next two William Orbit tracks are album highlights for me.  I'm a Sinner is the song that returns Madonna and Orbit back to \\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" territory. The track is fun, psychedelic and Madonna sounds pristine.  Love Spent is a wild ride that starts the track with a banjo that kicks into a slick beat and some of Madonna's best vocals. During the first half of this dancey electro auto-biographical piece, Madonna sings in a certain style on the chorus, and then two minutes into the track the banjo comes in again but this time when the song starts, its an entirely new song, new chorus and new energy. This dream-like second half of Love-Spent, with a pounding back beat, is sadder and lonelier. This track is essentially two different songs and two different emotions and stands as a major album highlight.<br />Closing out the standard edition of the album are two more William Orbit ballads. Masterpiece took home the Golden Globe Award for \\"Best Song\\" from a movie (W.E.) and takes us back to ballad sounds that came from \\"Something to Remember\\" and \\"Ray of Light.\\"<br />Falling Free is a stunning departure in sound from the rest of the album and the music sounds like something that would have been produced by the likes of Kate Bush (Wuthering Heights) or Tori Amos. Also similar in style to Madonna's own tracks, \\"Frozen,\\" \\"Mer Girl,\\" and \\"Has To Be,\\" Falling Free contains some of Madonna's most impressive vocals.<br/><br />The Deluxe version of the album contains five more tracks (one being a remix). Beautiful Killer, an electro dance tune in the vein of \\"Let It Will Be\\" from her Confessions album along with 80's dance beats, is sleek and sexy and deserved a place on the standard edition of the album as does the next track.<br />I \\"effed\\" Up is a gorgeous pop ballad who's contemplative yet simple lyrics bring chills to my body and make me feel sympathetic to Madonna and wonder what she went through in her marriage. As I listen to this, I wonder could she be singing this just to Guy, or could it be to her brother Christopher, or maybe her legions of gay fans who feel that she has long forgotten them as she now makes documentaries about her domestic life and prefers to discuss her faith over her politics. On this album, Madonna gives a wink to the gays and reminds them who it was that was pushing expression, love and tolerance in the 80's and 90's.<br />The album goes into a psychedelic fluffy filler ala Cher's \\"Beat Goes On,\\" titled, \\"Bday Song\\" with another guest feature from M.I.A. and finally closes with \\"Best Friend,\\" a forgettable jittery R&B electro slow-jam.<br /><br />Madonna's albums of the last decade generally maintained a certain style of sound or theme throughout the entire record typically because she worked only with one or two producers for each album. This album see's her with no less than four different producers and because of this there's a disjointed feeling but on the bright side really gives us the opportunity to let MDNA be our soundtrack whether we are in the mood to dance or in the mood to cry. MDNA takes us on several different journeys and moods, taking the best of all her albums of the last decade and spitting out a shiny, black, euphoric, disco pill. Long live the Queen./><br />The Deluxe version of the album contains five more tracks (one being a remix).

B0053Q9DQI|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time.  I remember reading it as a teenager and loving it.  I still re-read it often.  I am so glad that the movie did not disappoint!!  I loved the casting of Michael Fassbender as Edward.  I loved the dreary landscape and how it set the tone for everything to come.  Love, Love, Love it!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love it and it works great! Is easy to install and use. I would recommend it to my friends.
B005S39YGU|5.0|This comedy is so refreshing, and actually funny. Each character plays so well off each other. It is a program that i can envision Robyn Williams laughing with the characters!
B007ORVC36|4.0|The first commenter must of watched it at the wrong time. I just finished the first episode and the only time I noticed any artifacts was during dark scenes, which are few in the episode. I didn't notice any blurring at all, even with the video in full-screen mode at 1900x1200 (no, I didn't purchase the HD version). My head is also about 3 feet away from the monitor. The quality is not bad.<br /><br />As for the first episode of the long-awaited show, Draper's wife certainly looks better than she did in the fourth season (or at least I thought so) and its nice to see Sterling actually more involved with clients (despite the feud). This is only the first and it wasn't a bad way to start off the season I thought. No signs of Miss Jones in the episode but Don's kids make an appearance.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This organizer works great with our Baby Jogger City Mini.  Holds two 16+ oz water bottles, small teething toys, cell phone, keys no problem.

B0015DROBO|4.0|The beginning and the end are pretty slow. But everything in between was great! The characters are well developed, as is the plot. I also liked the way the book wraps up allowing anyone who didn't particularly enjoy it to decide if they want to continue on with the rest of the series.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|The Second Season of Walking dead started well, but ended in a three episode mini ark that showed why the reviewers and fans alike rated this series so highly from the start.  Now I am REALLY looking forward to season three.  this show is really exceptional, doesn't pull many punches when it comes to the horror and gore, and yet still manages to have a great story, and great acting.  For me, it's hard to cram all of that into one show, and this show does it better than any other I have seen, short of American Horror Story.  I've had the pleasure of reading all 94 comics to this point, and I look forward to some new characters the show will have in the next season.  70 bucks for that kind of packaging is pretty awesome too!  If you havent watched this show yet, and you like LEGIT horror and SOLID drama..Don't miss this series.
B00756GKBA|5.0|After being somewhat under whelmed but the first single I was apprehensive about MDNA.  Having now listened to the album in full (several times) I can happily say that this is Madonna's best album since Ray of Light.<br /><br />MDNA is full of uplifting dance/pop gems like 'I'm addicted' 'Turn up the Radio' and 'Some Girls'. However it's the Tarantino inspired 'Gang Bang' that is the stand out moment on this album and could very well be the best pop song recorded in the last 10 years.<br /><br />While this album is mainly club ready dance tracks the ballad 'Falling Free' is a beautifully sung masterpiece which takes you back to her Ray of Light glory.<br /><br />Madonna is back and as Nicki tells us on the track 'I Don't Give A' - 'There is only one queen and that's Madonna...'

B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna takes no prisoners on this outing,nothing was left to chance. Madonna takes all of today's filtering electro pop mess and pins it down and forces it into submission. Unlike 2008'Hard Candy, the production here leaves ample room for Madonna to shine and not distract the listener with the production,you feel her on every track.The most shocking track is Gang Bang it evokes images of a spurned vixen/murderess hell bent to a exact revenge even in hell. The iconography of the images invoked in Gang Bang suits Madonna like a well tailored dominatrix outfit by Gaultier. After my first listen of MDNA it reads like a really good book each chapter a page turner. MDNA is a wonderful return to form for Madonna. MDNA is equal parts super pop and art. The deluxe edition is two discs, 17 tracks in all. The discs are housed in a jewel case with a 20 page booklet.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I loved this book, as I love all the Reacher novels.  I just wish Lee Child could write faster.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use it almost every few days for taking notes at church.and meetings.  work related stuff to.works great and east to navigate for a not so tech guy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am 5'7'', and 135 lbs.  I mainly just wanted to tone up and lose about 10 pounds that I had gained from surgery.  This helped me get into shape.  At first the workouts were kinda difficult but I built my stamina. I liked the 3-2-1 approached and how she always kept you moving. I really felt like I got a workout after doing these, which is essential when it comes to a workout DVD.
B003Y5H51K|5.0|This is a great movie.  There is no Hollywood monster, but it is terrifying (unless extremely deep water and not being able to breathe doesn't frighten you?).  It is based on a true story, and you really wonder what on earth possesses these people to want to go several miles down under water to explore an unknown cave?  But it is very interesting, the acting is believable, the ending is good.  I have actually watched this movie a couple of times.  This movie arrived on time, and was packaged securely
B007BLCGNU|1.0|From beginning to end, one of the most down, weird, and uninspiring movies of the year. Good cast, good director, not worth the time to watch it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I never met a book I didn't like. Until this one.<br />I finished it, hoping for a redeeming story line to develop. It never did.<br /><br />The only good thing about this book is many of the negative reviews are so freak'n funny, rolling on the floor, as you could only appreciate by having suffered through it.<br />I almost choked over one reviewer's comment concerning  \\"long fingers\\" on a negative review.  Sort of made up for my wasting 10 bucks on a Kindle download.

B00756GKBA|4.0|Before I get into the actual review, let me preface it by saying that I am a huge Madonna fan and have been for most of my 30 years. Her music and messages have inspired me through good times and bad, personally and professionally; I have over 200 CD's from around the world and a Madonna tattoo on my leg, so trust me, I know what I'm talking about, lol. But in a weird way I'm also sort of the \\"anti-fan,\\" because nothing annoys me more than those fans who are so busy falling over themselves in giddy fits of \\"OMG my Queen is so perfect in every way!\\" that they never really take the time to stop and THINK if what she does is actually good or not, and why. The yes-men who eat up everything Madonna does solely out of habit give the real fans like me, who actually use their brain to evaluate things objectively - which of course is what Madonna is all about - a bad name. (Don't get me wrong, I used to be the same way...when I was 12. The throngs of middle-aged gay men lining up to buy 6 bottles of her new ladies' perfume simply because it has her name on the bottle, however, are a complete embarrassment to my kind.) Point is, for every person who hates Madonna blindly, there are another two or three who love her blindly, and that's just as bad. Know that my opinion, while sure to ruffle some feathers, will be as honest, thoughtful, and most importantly, informed, as I can possibly make it.<br /><br />So with that said, I feel no shame whatsoever in admitting I absolutely loathed her last studio album, 2008's Hard Candy, and was half afraid she'd never recover from what seemed like the kiss of death to her otherwise artfully illustrious career. For the first time ever it seemed as if she were the follower and not the leader, hopping on the disgusting \\"let's feature an interchangeable rapper in every song so we can get airplay on American radio\\" bandwagon, which still totally backfired since no one wants to acknowledge that anyone over 25 exists in pop culture anyway, much less a white woman in her 50's trying to be \\"street.\\" Age aside, it was an obvious act of desperation. \\"Oh, she's just having fun and not trying to make a statement this time,\\" my fellow fans would say. Well, that's fine, but if she really was having fun, I'll eat my foot, because her voice was painfully flat and lifeless, and she sounded terribly bored as if she herself subconsciously (or perhaps consciously?) knew she was selling out. Not that I necessarily expect her to reinvent the wheel with each new record, either, but if she as the artist isn't having fun, I as the consumer am not having fun. (Even the videos from this era are totally phoned in; I was surprised she knew how to be that lazy. Thankfully, she seemed less awkward with the new material during the accompanying Sticky and Sweet Tour performances, but only just.) To sum it up, aside from two or three brief moments, Hard Candy was basically bad music, done badly, and we shall never speak of it again.<br /><br />Then she sort of went undercover, released a so-so greatest hits package, directed a so-so movie, performed a fabulous Superbowl halftime show that I'm sure Elton John just loved the heck out of, and now here she is again, four years later, with MDNA, the new album the world was waiting for with baited breath. (I'm told in addition to being a play on her own name, the title is also a cheeky allusion to the drug ecstasy. As someone who has never touched even a single cigarette in his entire life, the reference was lost on me.) Now, to be perfectly blunt, Give Me All Your Luvin', the first single that leaked several months prior, initially suggested to me that she finally gave up caring about music altogether. Juvenile lyrics, wooden vocals, and obnoxious \\"been there, done that\\" guest spots by Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. does not a hit make. Well, these days I suppose it does, actually, although I can't claim to know anybody firsthand who enjoys having their pop songs ruined by ghetto rap interludes. But `tis the norm now, so I digress. I finally had to admit it was growing on me when I found myself serenading the dogs with cheerleader chants, so it did ultimately prove to be a little catchy, and there's at least something to be said for that aspect of it. Plus the video was kinda cute and she looked freaking amazing in it. Another song I heard early on was the Golden Globe winning ballad Masterpiece, which was also featured in her film W.E., and it was love at first listen. While not quite up there with the likes of Take a Bow, Live to Tell, or even This Used to Be My Playground, it's a magnificent song with a beautiful arrangement and heartfelt lyrics sung so poetically that I can easily say it's her best song, period, in at least the last 6 or 7 years. So far it seemed like a mixed bag, but by this point I considered myself cautiously optimistic about her record as a whole and whatever chameleonic incarnation she was about to unleash upon the world. (I'm not even going to address the fact this is Madonna's first CD in a post-Gaga universe. They are both great - and very different -  artists in their own right, and the idiots who perpetuate the idea that you can't enjoy one just because you do like the other need serious professional help. It's not a competition and there's no reason whatsoever to measure them against eachother.)<br /><br />So let's cut to the chase - is MDNA any good? I'm glad to report that, for the most part, YES, yes it is! It doesn't exactly scream instant classic, mind you, but as a follow up to the cringe-worthy Hard Candy, it definitely redeems Madonna as a credible pop artist. My initial impression of a mixed bag wasn't too far off, and like any record, there are high points and low points, a few of which I'll touch on briefly. The album's opener and second single, Girl Gone Wild, is a frantic, fast-paced powerhouse of a song that almost ventures into rave territory, so have your glow sticks close at hand and get ready to sweat. Turn Up the Radio is another carefree, commercially safe, pulsating club thumper that I'd guess will eventually be a single as well. Gang Bang is a somewhat demented spoken-word track in which we find a scorned Madonna fantasizing about shooting her lover in the head, and one which would not be entirely out of place on the Erotica album. Love it! Falling Free is the Mer Girl of the album, with no real chorus or loop to speak of, just Madonna's lush vocals over a minimal, meandering musical swell. It's one of the few songs in recent memory that proves Madonna really CAN sing when she feels like it. Love Spent didn't really hold my attention at first, but repeat listenings reveal a lot of interesting things happening musically that give it a unique \\"texture,\\" if that makes sense. It still isn't the strongest hook you'll ever hear, but it's definitely shaping up to be a favorite. Despite the crass title, I F'd Up is a lovely semi-ballad which has Madonna admitting she isn't the easiest person to live with. A nice complement to the rest of the album's abrasive \\"no regrets\\" theme that fits oddly well. I think Superstar was supposed to be Madonna showing her cutesy, lovey-dovey side a la Cherish, even featuring her daughter Lourdes on background vocals, but unfortunately the lyrics are so corny, if not downright peculiar, it's hard to take the underlying sentiment seriously. Not horrible per se, but Little Star this is not. I'm Addicted has Madonna doing her best Kylie Minogue impression, and the results are sketchy. I love some good techno, but to my ears this fan favorite comes off as a sort of remix gone wrong, amounting to basically one big pile of random noise. (And this is from someone who LOVED Impressive Instant!) Some Girls is another track that falls victim to overproduction; I'm sure \\"on paper\\" it was meant to be a statement about Madonna's place in an industry that's become overrun by 20-somethings, but her voice is so drowned out you can't hear a word and the effect is lost. Professional party rockers LMFAO, who I admit can be sorta fun in their own right, further slaughtered Give Me all Your Luvin' with their bonus remix by utilizing but a small snippet of Madonna's vocals and adding even more tired rap sections. Sigh. At least by the end of it you'll probably appreciate the tepid original version a little bit more. Lastly, I Don't Give A with Nicki Minaj (again) is so atrocious on every level I congratulate the few of you who make it past the first 20 seconds.<br /><br />As you can see, MDNA is a varied album that offers up a little something for everyone. And though it may not have broken any new ground, I don't think it necessarily strived to either. That's fine, because I believe even Madonna's most ardent supporters would admit we're not likely to ever get another Like a Prayer or Ray of Light out of her. However, the record succeeds in its intentions where Hard Candy miserably failed - this is about as youthful, refreshed, and playful as I've seen her in quite a while, and for the first time in recent memory I'm willing to believe that just maybe she is genuinely having a little bit of fun. Combined with the moments of candid darkness, intensity, and general diva-ness, this is, in theory, the perfect Madonna record. I think the thing that keeps it from being truly great is the fact that she chose to work with SO many producers who each want a piece of the pie, that Madonna herself at times comes in as an afterthought or is forced to play second fiddle to someone else's \\"hot beats.\\" It's not the worst case of too many cooks in the kitchen I've seen her mixed up in, but something about the flow and consistency of the album strikes me as off, though many elements work surprisingly well individually. Another sour point is that her lyrics these days tend to be derivative of her own earlier work, which would be fine if it seemed she were intentionally paying homage to herself in a clever wink wink, nudge nudge sort of way. Rather, it more often comes off as though she has simply run out of ideas and may not even realize she's recycling entire phrases. On the bright side, we aren't getting 12 songs built around some form of the word \\"hesitation\\" this time either, lol, so it's progress. Taken together I figure it all balances out to a 3.5 star rating. In short, what's good is REALLY good, but nearly half the disc is comprised of filler that doesn't leave much of an impression one way or the other. I'm generously rounding up to 4 stars because in spite of that criticism, only a small portion is what I'd dare to label as actually being \\"bad.\\"<br /><br />In the end MDNA is very much a reflection of its time; overall she seems perfectly content in embracing the current trends in pop music and just putting her own spin on them, rather than exhausting the effort to be innovative and stay ahead of the curve. Hence this CD probably won't be one of the more celebrated/remembered entries in her catalogue down the road. I understand that approach, since I imagine most \\"classic\\" artists are feeling the pressure to stay relevant these days more than ever, but it does make you wonder how far the uber-ballsy Madonna of decades past would make it as a new act in 2012. Anyhow...Where she goes from here I'm not sure. But as it stands now, despite a rocky patch here and there, she still has all my L-U-V.p the Radio is another carefree, commercially safe, pulsating club thumper that I'd guess will eventually be a single as well.

I'm generously rounding up to 4 stars because in spite of that criticism, only a small portion is what I'd dare to label as actually being \\"bad.\\"<br /><br />In the end MDNA is very much a reflection of its time; overall she seems perfectly content in embracing the current trends in pop music and just putting her own spin on them, rather than exhausting the effort to be innovative and stay ahead of the curve. Hence this CD probably won't be one of the more celebrated/remembered entries in her catalogue down the road. I understand that approach, since I imagine most \\"classic\\" artists are feeling the pressure to stay relevant these days more than ever, but it does make you wonder how far the uber-ballsy Madonna of decades past would make it as a new act in 2012. Anyhow...Where she goes from here I'm not sure. But as it stands now, despite a rocky patch here and there, she still has all my L-U-V.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|If you've not seen \\"The Ultimate Cut: Watchmen\\" then you've not seen the film as it should truly be seen. This is the definitive version of one of the greatest comic book film adaptations of all time, containing all deleted footage plus incorporating the animated \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" for the best possible page-to-screen adaptation possible for one of the finest comic books ever produced. The box and artwork in the packaging is also impressive, making for a wonderful box set that I personally now consider the only way to really watch this film. The Director's Cut was great, make no mistake, but once you've seen The Ultimate Cut you won't want to watch it any other way. Even if you didn't like the theatrical version of the film, give this one a try, because the difference is like night and day.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|This is one of the hardest, stiffest knives I have ever owned. You can do anything with this beast: survival, hunting, skinning, rescue, self defence, utility...this is a multi purpose 6\\" blade. THe point on this knife can do some serious damage. If you look at the blade closely, you can see where the different steels  mesh.  This is a very intimidating knife and I have to admit- I get the chills just holding it in my hand. So will you - trust me! The handle feels like a soft rubber that grips your hand very well. This is one of the best knives you will ever own (perhaps other than the Fallknieven A1 knife). The medium 6\\" blade survival knives are the way to go. The sheath is awesome. It fits the contour of the blade and has a drain hole at the bottom  of the sheath. This knife looks menacing. This is not a cheap $12 survival knife made in China. It says made in Japan on the blade. This knife has a bit of heft to it but that is expected with a knife of this caliber. Great for whacking and chopping and throwing at close range. For about 110 US bucks- its the best knife of this caliber around.
B005LB1MY6|5.0|Great Album!!  I like Cross, but I like this one better!  Its like Genesis / Tron mixed together!!!  Nice light melodies are refreshing from the dark tunes in Cross.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy this game and the added challenge of earning enough points for the new games. I have my kids play the ones I cant master.
0374275637|5.0|I loved this. It's full of facts and case studies but is still somehow easy to digest. The author isn't preachy at all and recognizes that he falls into the same traps as the people he describes in his studies. He does a great job of making this accessible to individuals from all walks of life.<br /><br />This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in understanding more about how the mind works. It would do all of us good to realize how much of what we take for granted and intuit doesn't quite reflect reality.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|If you have seen this movie, you will love this cd!  I purchased both cd's because some of the songs are sung by the people in the movie & some are not.  The ones that aren't are on the other. (hope that makes sense to you)  I love them both!  Double thumbs up from me!
B0071MV540|4.0|Not just \\"nothing to complain\\" but it's really Very light and funny movie, nice casts.<br />Don't miss it just get and relax :)<br />Thanks

B007NZ7LIY|4.0|I played Another World on the Amiga 20 years ago.  It's a fun game I would describe as an action/platformer.  Very nice port with nicely up-scaled graphics and sound.  The controls are fairly intuitive however not as smooth as using a joystick, as most touch-based games go.  I recommend playing it on a tablet as opposed to a phone, for a better experience.  Works fine on my Motorola Droid X and Viewsonic gTablet.  Thanks dotEmu!

0439023513|2.0|It's hard to believe that the last ten pages of this book (the best writing of the whole series) were written by the same person who wrote the first 1190 or so pages.  Nothing subtle, elegant, or thought-provoking about the writing in this series.  It was coarse, smacking the reader over the head with a barrage of preachy lessons brought to the fore by preposterous and unbelievable situations and events.  The characters inhabit a land in the future where they are apparently freed from the rules of grammar and punctuation. I found the writing style painful to read. I took to highlighting the many and varied problems with word usage, awkward sentences, and glaring grammatical and punctuation errors. What were those three editors doing?  Or maybe I should wonder how much worse the earlier drafts were.<br /><br />That said, the story is an interesting idea that had promise (unfulfilled), some of the characters were likable (although most were undeveloped and lacked depth), and it was a page-turner.<br /><br />I also found the ideas of how life would be different in the future lacking in imagination and downright stupid. Orange hair and pink streets are not creative ideas of what the future holds.  Is that the best that could be done with such a rich topic?  The type of creativity that delights the reader in books like the Harry Potter series was sadly lacking in the Hunger Games.  And the obvious moral themes and questions about human nature were not explored.  Forgiving these lapses by saying this is young adult fiction does not wash with me.  I remember reading beautiful prose by Ayn Rand when I was 13.<br /><br />I'm so glad it's over, but I guess I'm glad I read it.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I should not have let my son buy these, after four months the ear cup broke.  It is a very poor design where the swivel is made out of plastic.  If you go on youtube you will see plenty of videos of kids coming up with way to fix them.  My son is really careful with his stuff and was really disappointed when they broke.  If I could give this less than 1 star I would.<br /><br />IF YOU BUY THESE BE AWARE ITS NOT IF THEY WILL BREAK IT IS WHEN.<br /><br />I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER TURTLE BEACH PRODUCT AGAIN.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am an avid reader and loved this trilogy. I didnt want this love story of Ana and Christian to end. Getting past the erotica part of these 2 people(which was amazing!)the story of these 2 was fun. i loved the emails,the way they interact. i was pulling for this realtionship to work out. I strongly suggest reading these 3 books asap, and have done just that w/at least 5 friends. Ihave never reread books but have made an exception with these because having no information about them before starting to read ,i realized that I have missed things. I am now in the middle of the 2nd book for the 2nd time. its still on the top of my list of books!
0345472322|5.0|This book blasts the conventional wisdom that intelligence, character or aptitude are fixed quantities.  Most intriguing and certainly a valid criticism of our society's value system with regards to education, what constitutes being 'smart' and 'dumb' and parenting.  I want my kids to read it before they have their own children to bring up (i.e., indoctrinate)!
0446547654|3.0|I was dissappointed in this book.  Not Mr. Sparks' best work by a long shot.  The plot description intrigued me enough to begin the book but by about half way through it, I was seriously considering just shelving it and moving on to something else.  Since I had already invested the time to read the first half and because I was hoping I would be rewarded with the last half picking up somehow, I trudged through.  The ending was terribly predictable and I found the constant back and forth between the (too numerous) cast of the characters to be almost dizzying at times.  I think Mr. Sparks has officially run out of plot lines.  :-(
B003Y5H574|4.0|Okay, so this movie wasn't nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, but it offers something even better . . . it's a fun and entertaining movie to watch.  You don't have to think too much.  You can relate to the characters.  Nobody has to explain anything to you.  And it is even in color (as opposed to this year's Best Picture winner).<br /><br />When his wife asks for a divorce, Cal (Steve Carell) spirals into a tailspin of sadness and grief.  Enter Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a slick ladies man who is takes pity upon Cal and resolves to help him get over his wife by teaching him how to seduce women.  But Cal already knows what Jacob has yet to learn . . . that the enduring love of one partner is superior to casual sex with countless partners.<br /><br />With Julianne Moore in the role of Cal's wife and Emma Stone in a supporting role, this is a talented cast who really made this movie work.<br /><br />If you are looking for a movie that is both endearing and funny, you won't go wrong with this pick.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard about all the hype for this book, but I stayed away from it because I hate twilight, and most of the people I knew who liked twilight liked it. Heck if you go to the Hunger Games facebook page teen girls are forming team peetas and team gales. There is no way I would like this book. I saw a ad for the movie...I choose to give it the a try...I am glad I did!!<br /> This book is engaging and had me hooked from the first sentence of the first chapter and I could not put my Kindle down till it was finished. Every chapter ends in a cliff hanger which makes read it faster then any book you have read sence Harry Potter.<br /> You know the plot, you know the hype, you know about the movie, but if you have not read this book you need to buy it now.
0316017930|4.0|Outliers, by Malcom Gladwell, presents the idea that success is rarely the result of the efforts of the individual but much more commonly a result of the culture and opportunities that have been made available to that individual.  Gladwell presents many examples to illustrate his assumptions.<br /><br />This book is most famously known for the concept that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert. The concept is illustrated by sharing stories of success including Bill Gates, The Beatles and even National Hockey League players.  The book goes on to discuss the advantages that many different cultures have had on the success of their people. One such example is that of the Asian rice farmers.<br /><br />For me, the biggest question that seems to be left unanswered in this book is, what can we do about our given circumstances? Are we really doomed to failure because we weren't born into the right culture or given the right opportunities to achieve success?  I'm afraid this book is going to leave a lot of people with a lack of hope that they have any power to change their own future.<br /><br />The book is very much worth the time to read it even if many questions are brought up in the processes.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|It's nice to see Disney not give up on hand drawn animation even with the Pixar domination today.  In fact, Pixar chief John Lassiter is executive producer on this film.  Along with \\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\\", a stop motion puppet style film proves that it really is the story that counts, not technical gravitas.  This must be Disney's umpteenth story involving princesses and/or princes, yet the plot movies along and has the usual strong moral imperative.  Some nice voice acting and a strong musical score and a few memorable songs set the movie apart from the usual fare.

1932100660|5.0|The China Study is a very informative book! I just recently began learning how to eat a plant based diet. I have not cut meat completely, but have cut down to 3 meat servings per week. The first book I read was written by John Robbins, this is the reason I chose read this book (the forward is by John Robbins). I strongly encourage anyone who is unsure about whether a plant based diet is a health conscience choice for them or not, to read this book. The book is backed by numerous scientific studies. You will not be disappointed with this read!

0439023513|4.0|In MockingJay we continue where Catching Fire left off. To avoid spoilers this is all I will say of the book. I gave this book a 4 out of 5 because I felt that there were so many things that happened that didn't need to happen to still stay true to the grittiness and realness of the series. I pointed out in my last review that both the PRO and CON of this series was the fact that it was shockingly gritty and realistic. It was unique, heartbreaking, but at the same time disappointing come MockingJay.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is a fantastic author. This series was entertaining, heartbreaking, and dynamic. The world of the series was so elegantly crafted, and the characters were all loved/hated and made you feel for those you were supposed to feel for. Having read the whole series, I will say that I am indeed a fan.<br /><br />So comes the end of this review of the final book in this series. Although this third book ended on a bittersweet note, it was still an ending to remember, and the hype around these books is well deserved. So here is to Katniss Everdeen....the girl who was on fire!
B003HZW26U|5.0|I can't believe that I was fortunate to get a used copy from someone.  I will never part with this book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you have not began to read this series at my previous recommendation, then you may not be the individual intellectual insidious reader I had previously & preciously recommend this series of hair standing, punch in the gut, & sometimes, nail biting, collection of short story formatted reads that most likely could be place in the league of an O'Henry. If my status or opinion offends or just \\"ruffles your feathers \\" a bit, I welcome anyone (after reading at least the 1st 2 books and no further!!) to enlighten me!!
B00003CX8N|5.0|How can you go wrong watching a movie starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins? This is such a sweet, melancholy, moving journey to see. I recommend this to all who like to be entertained with wonderful actors, having touches of laughter and tears and a wonderful ending...just like the movies in the old days with actors like Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, Bogey & Bacall, etc.  I highly recommend this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it. great game interesting always new challenges and interesting neat to do. keeps you busy and gives a neat outlook to how a city runs
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's been a while since i read my last novel and when i decided to give hunger games a try, since it's not my usual kind of reading material which is love story, i was easily hooked by its compelling story. Plus i was not disappointed because it also offers a love story that really warms my heart and gives balance to the barbaric theme of the storyline. I do recommend it as a good read.
B004SEUIW4|5.0|I loved Adventureland. This movie made me truly JEALOUS that I didn't get to grow up in the 70s. I also loved the character personalities in this movie. Kristen Steward and Jesse Eisenberg did great in this movie, and so did the rest of the cast. A+
B0065GG2ZK|4.0|I waited for quite a while before I bought the album due to the fact I thought it was a bit overpriced and wanted to wait for it to be a little cheaper.  When I finally got the album in its entirety I have to say I was somewhat surprised how good it actually is!  There is a good mix of slower R&B hits and some upbeat club hits.  I really am enjoying this album as much as anything else out right now! Well done!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thought this book was great.  It gives us a look into what goes on in wartime  with the elite teams such as the Seals, what they have to go through to get there.  It also gives us a glimpse into the experiences of the soldier's families back home.  I am not an aficionado of guns so the technical aspect of the firearms went a bit over my head, but I got the basic idea of what the author was explaining.  I also want to thank Chris and all the veterans and soldiers for the great job they do in fighting for this country.  I know I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for the selfless acts from all the branches of the service.  I wish all my countrymen felt this way.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I really like this season of Criminal Minds. All of the episodes have good storylines,writing,etc. I also like the fact that at times in each episode we get to see that the characters are human and have feelings just like the rest of us.

One wonders how such a show ended up on MTV but, then again, there are also get great shows on FOX... The world is full of contradictions. The fact that the music is different doesn't matter at all because this show remains just as enjoyable (if not more).

B0071XO8RA|5.0|i read the first wool book a while back and loved it. i was browsing through the kindle store the other day and saw 'wool omnibus edition' and my immediate thought was 'what the duce?'.  after gathering my wits and whilst fighting the urge to wake my sleeping husband to notify him of my enormous good fortute, i prompltly pressed buy and immediatly set to reading.  i have never been one for labeling and dont know (or much care) for what genera this book falls into, all i can tell you is that this is a wonderful set of books and at $4.99 a jolly good buy. as a testament to how good this book is, i have for the first time ever written a review from my 3rd gen kindle...which is no small feat and also the reason there is minimal punctuation and no capital letters!

B003EYVXV4|5.0|I've never read the books and didn't know what to expect from the Hunger Games except that it was a combination of The Lottery crossed with The Running Man for preteen girls; or, if you know your Japanese literature, Battle Royale.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover it is so much more than that.<br /><br />The future of The Hunger Games is basically a Roman Empire updated to modern times.  In that respect it reminded of the role-playing game X-Crawl, which did much the same thing with a fantasy twist.  There are twelve districts that send \\"tributes\\" to the Hunger Games, which are basically televised gladiatorial combats in which children slaughter each other. Every year a raffle known as a reaping is held to choose a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18.  There can be only one winner. Being televised, The Hunger Games is influenced by the upper class citizens of the dominating Capitol district; contestants are interviewed before the game and during the event can win sponsorships, which in turn earns in-game advantages like healing ointments.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to join the Hunger Games when her little sister Primrose (Willow Shields) is selected by lottery.  Her male companion is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and his complicated past with Katniss will affect their relationship and the game. The game itself takes place on what can only be described as a holodeck like arena that can be manipulated by technicians directed by Gamemaker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley).<br /><br />Each team has its own entourage, including public relations (Elizabeth Banks as the grating Effie Trinket), a trainer (the drunk Haymitch Abernathy played by a probably drunk Woody Harrelson), and a personal stylist (Cinna, played by Lenny Kravitz channeling Prince).  These five characters manage to gel nicely on screen: Lawrence plays Katniss as aloof and frequently terrified, but with enough steely resolve that you believe she can kill; Hutcherson looks even more terrified than Lawrence and in a twist plays the \\"damsel in distress\\" to Katniss' vigorous presence; Banks is a cartoonish reminder of what Capitol citizens are like (clowns, basically); Harrelson channels frustrated class rage that keeps him in his spirits until he realizes Katniss has a chance at winning; and finally Kravitz does an excellent job of being the only sane person who seems to care about Katniss as a human being.  Director Gary Ross knew what he was doing when he cast this little dysfunctional family.<br /><br />If this all sounds like grim stuff on screen, it is. The Hunger Games is particularly gut-wrenching for parents.  The children can be as young as 12, so there are little ones who are far out of their depth. To the film's credit The Hunger Games never flinches from its basic premise of kids murdering each other.  Although they are more likely to die of deprivation and disease, the Gamemakers force them into conflict with forest fires and even monsters.  And it's all televised around the clock.<br /><br />Lurking in the background is the political unrest that The Hunger Games elicit, particularly over the slaughter of 23 children each year.  While some districts train their children for combat and thus volunteer, the other districts enter unwillingly, which has consequences for the political stranglehold the Capitol lords over them all.  The state-mandated executions have all the pomp and circumstance of a Roman gladiatorial bout.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is of particular interest to gamers.  Video gamers will see the constructed environments as quite similar to first-person shooters; tabletop role-players will see the Gamemaker role in their own killer game masters.  This may be the first mainstream movie that makes being a game master cool.  And if it gives preteen girls someone to look up to whose goal in life is greater than pining for her vampire boyfriend, I'm okay with that.son looks even more terrified than Lawrence and in a twist plays the \\"damsel in distress\\" to Katniss' vigorous presence; Banks is a cartoonish reminder of what Capitol citizens are like (clowns, basically); Harrelson channels frustrated class rage that keeps him in his spirits until he realizes Katniss has a chance at winning; and finally Kravitz does an excellent job of being the only sane person who seems to care about Katniss as a human being.

Most ingredients on the book are easy to find, if you don't like certain dishes, there're tons of alternatives on the back , such as use beef instead of turkey. And everything is so simple and most of them takes less than 30 minute to prepare. Not to mention the bento looks beautiful afterwards!

B005FITIK0|4.0|As young people flock to line up for such films as `The Hunger Game' opening, attempting to get a view of how rage is OK under given circumstances, along comes another little film from the pen of Diablo Cody (Juno, Jennifer's Body, United States of Tara) and under the direction of Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air, Thank you for Smoking) that is so unsettling in its message that it makes other make-believe story movies pale in comparison. Add to this combination an actress of the caliber of Charlize Theron and you end up with one disturbing but excellent film.<br /><br />Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron), left her high school popularity in Mercury, MN to move on to Minneapolis to become a famous ghost writer of Young Adult romances.  Now age (she is now 37 years old), bad divorce, writer's block and alcoholism force her to stare in the mirror, see how she has slipped, and respond to an email birth announcement of a child born to her ex-flame Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) by deciding to return to Mercury and reignite her old passion for the now happily married Buddy.  She crams her tiny pet dog into her carryon, registers at the local motel (the desk is manned by a shrewd Louisa Krause), and is off to find a drink.  She there encounters Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt in a brilliant performance), a high school nobody who suffered massive physical abuse and subsequent permanent damage at the hands of jocks who beat him brutally for being gay (he isn't).  Mavis recognizes Matt, feels sorry for him, and confides in him that she is in town to rekindle her old romance with Buddy.  Despite Matt's warnings that Buddy is off limits Mavis, between bouts of drunken oblivion, fixes her appearance, makes contact with Buddy, is invited to Buddy's home to meet his wife Beth (Elisabeth Reaser) and new daughter, all the while focusing her wiles on seducing Buddy despite all evidence that the affair is dead. She eventually makes a fool of herself and finds her only solace is in Matt and Matt's very plain and bored sister Sandra (Collette Wolfe).  How the trip to Mercury ends is the surprising finale.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is such a fine actress that she is able to find crevices where we can peak into her life and find some love for her despicably ruined Mavis. The entire cast is excellent and includes cameos by Mary Beth Hurt and Jill Eikenberry.  Once again Diablo Cody invites us to look at just what defines `adult' and why so many people stumble on their way to that plateau. At times it is difficult to see the comedy in this film, but stand far enough back and it is the human comedy that we are watching.  Cody, with Reitman, makes that clear.  Grady Harp, March 12's very plain and bored sister Sandra (Collette Wolfe).  How the trip to Mercury ends is the surprising finale.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is such a fine actress that she is able to find crevices where we can peak into her life and find some love for her despicably ruined Mavis. The entire cast is excellent and includes cameos by Mary Beth Hurt and Jill Eikenberry.  Once again Diablo Cody invites us to look at just what defines `adult' and why so many people stumble on their way to that plateau. At times it is difficult to see the comedy in this film, but stand far enough back and it is the human comedy that we are watching.  Cody, with Reitman, makes that clear.  Grady Harp, March 12

B003E6K1VK|5.0|To begin, I can't say much about this in comparison to other DACs or headphone amps. This is my first and only one.<br />Even with that, though, I can say a lot of good about it. I bought these to drive my new Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pros, but I've used them with my old 'phones as well, my Klipsch Image S4s. I wasn't expecting too much with this; namely, enough to drive the headphones. So the first thing that surprised me was the way they were packaged. They came like an iPod, in a robust rectangular box with high quality photographs of the item and the item name and brand printed on the sides. So the good impression starts immediately; this has been packaged quite well. It sits in a plastic basin like an iPod too, but comes in a silicone case, an excellent perk that I wasn't expecting. Then, under the plastic plate was a male to male 3.5mm jack, mini USB cable, manuals, a felt carrying case, and a screen protector. It comes very well-equipped, which was an awesome surprise. FiiO gets a ton of points for that.<br />I was very impressed with the quality of the device itself, too. Taking it out of the silicone case and removing the plastic protector on the front revealed the front to be made of smooth glass and the body to be made of brushed, black metal, with a few bolts on the back holding it together and contributing to the rugged look. The buttons on the side are metal as well. Even if it's not full-on audiophile grade (as other reviewers have said, anyway), it presents itself as a fairly high end item. If you're reluctant to drop the money on something that only drives headphones, the unboxing alone would reassure you a good bit.<br />Since this is all I've used the Beyers on, I can't say much about how far it takes or limits them. What I can say is that, with this driving the Beyerdynamics, I get a very crisp and detailed sound that leaves nothing for me to desire. Someday I may use the cans on a better amp and be able to pick out places where the FiiO lacks, but until then I'd say I feel that I got my money's worth on both products. Since the Beyers are 250 ohm, it's worth saying that the FiiO does drive them very well. I've gotten as loud as I've wanted without hitting max volume and without any apparent changes to the sound profile; everything is very consistent whether it's at 1 or 40.<br />With the Klipschs, I can at least talk about comparison with how they sounded plugged into my iMac (17\\" late 2006) or Thinkpad (X120e). For one thing, the FiiO has considerably less ambient noise. While there is very mild hiss, it's nowhere near as bad as that of the iMac's in-built jack or the unpleasant buzz of the Thinkpad. On the iMac, the S4s sound more detailed and better-imaged through the FiiO than through the headphone jack on the computer. It's an improvement, though with the overall quality of the S4s to begin with it may be slight overkill for them. In total, it ended up costing me something like $95 in contrast to $80 for the buds, and while they do sound better with them, I'd say that if your computer has a decent jack to begin with you'd probably be better off with a ~$150 pair and no DAC. This will vary depending on your computer and headphone selection, but there you go. With the incredible sensitivity of the Klipsch in-ears, you'll also run it at incredibly low volume levels. Right now, I'm listening to \\"Nachuraru-ni Koishite\\" by Perfume on the Klipschs at a mere volume of 3 and that's quite enough.<br />To conclude, though, this is a great little device. For the money, FiiO seems to treat you very well, and I'd certainly buy from them again. Go for it!

B0059XTUVI|4.0|The story let it down somewhat.  I thought a much better job could be done of Thatcher's life. Many of the important moments in her life were almost missed concentrating on trivial. Still it did keep my interest up throughout.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the characters were not properly developed in the movie. Many appeared very superficial.<br /><br />However, the acting was excellent, Meryl Streep performance was extremely good. As were most of the other actors.<br /><br />What I thought was brilliant was the makeup, they used on Maryl Streep. The way they could  make her look older and younger. I was very impressed with that.
B00000K2UX|3.0|1980's music has not dated gracefully compared to other decades but despite the age of the Top Gun Soundtrack, there are still a few good songs on it. Berlin's Take My Breath Away, which features prominently in the movie, is easily the most remembered but Might Wings by Cheap Trick is also very good as is Sittin' on the Dock of a Bay by Otis Reding. The rest of songs range from OK (Destination Unknown) to poor (Heaven in Your Eyes). The clear winner for me is the Top Gun Anthem. If I had to compile a playlist of 'motivational/inspirational songs' the anthem would certainly be included.<br /><br />Darkhorse86
1451627289|5.0|For a long time I've wondered if Stephen King would ever come out with a book again that rivaled those years when he had hit after hit and each book was better than the last.  He has achieved that and more with 11/22/63.<br /><br />The main character is Jake Epping, a thirty-something english teacher, who innocently becomes caught up in a time bubble that allows him to travel from 2011 back to 1958 and back again, each trip, no longer how long he stays in 1958 causes only 2 minutes to go by in 2011.  When his friend Al, the local diner owner shows him this, he can't believe it and they start to wonder if they can go back to change some things and right some wrongs.  Jake wants to see if the janitor who is taking his night class could be healed from a life long injury brought on by an abusive father who kills his entire family.  He also goes back to see if he can save a young woman who is wheel chair bound after she is hit with a bullet in a hunting accident.  Things seem to be going well, and he starts to spend more and more time in 1958 where he takes on the name George Amberson.  As George, he teaches school, falls in love with the young librarian and gets enmeshed in the world of 1958, long before he was born.  As he and Al talk he finds that Al's one last wish is that he try to get to 1963 and prevent the Kennedy assasination.  This becomes his focus on the last half of the book, tracking Oswald and his family and trying to figure out how and when he will take the would-be assasin out so that Kennedy can be saved.  But what is the cost?<br /><br />The last quarter of the book is very fast paced and it was difficult to put it down.  You aren't sure which case you will end up with, a John Kennedy who lives and what that would mean to 2011 or a John Kennedy that dies, and if that is the case, why would that be the outcome that we would want?  If he changes the past, will he end up with Sadie, the lovely librarian, or not?<br /><br />As many who read King know, he sometimes can write a long book that you love until the ending comes and you feel like \\"damn, he got me again\\", a great book with an ending that did not satisfy.  This book was not like that in the least.  The ending was fitting, made sense and was extremely satisfying on every level.<br /><br />I would have to say this has been one of the best books I have read in a while and I'm happy to say has that same old vintage King feel that I so loved in the past.<br /><br />I would wholeheartedly recommend this as a great read for those that love King's earlier works, those who love the time travel element or just want a book that is both unique and satisfying.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was my first William Landay book and I was not disappointed.  I thought that the first half of the book dragged a little bit but the last half really picked up and definitely had a surprise ending which made me gasp.  I live in the Boston area and have visited Cold Spring Park many times and I am also the mother of an adolescent boy - so the book really hit close to him.  This was one of the best books I have read this year.  Kudos to the author.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Awesome. For those that didnt live in this generation it took you back to it to show how society lived.

B003Y5H5HY|3.0|So we all know that this was originally a Sweedish movie with English subtitles, right? And we all know that Director David Fincher simply re-did this American version of the film albeit with a completely different cast, right? And we all know that the movie(s) is based on the first of three books in a trilogy by Sweedish Author Stieg Larsson (RiP), right? And we all know that the original title of the book and movie were changed from Men Who Hate Women to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so that it would be well received marketingwise in the US and not perceived as a bash against men by antisexism groups, right? And finally, we all know that two more films in the trilogy have already been released with the Sweedish cast (with less than positive reviews) and that Sony says the American cast has signed on for re-dos of the two sequels here in the US...right?<br /><br />Whew. With all that out of the way, I thought The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very good. Two story lines woven together nicely. The first story line follows Journalist Mikael Blomkvist after being convicted of libel for accusing a high powered businessman of unethical and illegal activity. The widely publicized trial brings Blomkvist to the attention of another high powered businessman named Vanger who is looking for a long lost niece; Vanger thinks Blomkvist would be the perfect person to solve the mystery of his 40 years missing niece.<br /><br />Enter storyline 2: Vanger has hired a Goth lady named Lisbeth to determine if Blomkvist is the right man to hunt for his niece. And the story arcs from there to the struggles of Lisbeth's everyday life of trying to make ends meet while on probation for some crimes committed in her relatively distant past. Be warned, like the Swedish version, there are some scenes of rape and torture that are very unsettling and difficult to sit through in this film.<br /><br />Ultimately, both story lines are brilliantly connected with each other in a thriller tale of intrigue, deception, mystery, murder and revenge. It's a very good movie that stands on its own with no cliffhanger ending that requires seeing the upcoming sequels. Highly recommended but not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Having seen the original film I found myself involuntarily comparing Fincher's US version to the Sweedish version a few times during the film. And there was something about the original Sweedish version that made everything so much more real...especially Lisbeth, the character played by Rooney Mara. Fincher made Lisbeth somewhat of a, how should I say this?...\\"anti-superhero???\\" While Noomi Rapace played Lisbeth in the Sweedish version with a seriousness that made you think she was a real person out there somewhere, and that a camera followed her like a fly on the wall.

I get why artists need to do different things to stay fresh and, much as I may have wished, I understand that everything they do can't be like Infinite Fire. Still, there is nothing really special here. In fact, vast parts of it are truly pedestrian. Totally underwhelmed with Casey, Larue and N. Morse do little of note, and Portnoy's drumming is merely adequate. The only bright spot is Steve's playing - always exceptional. I'll give it a few more listens and perhaps it will grow on me, but I am not counting on it. More than likely I'll rip 2 or 3 songs and spin them up every so often..

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm not a fan of gooey, hack 'em up, whack 'em up movies or shows but this is an entirely different thing. I have always loved movies that were based on comic books and graphic novels (Blade, Kick Ass, Dark Knight)and when The Walking dead was produced I just had to take a peek. Holy Moley! AMC really hit one out of the ballpark with this! I have the comics and while the show deviates a little, it maintains the  story.<br /><br />This is about real survival of the human race after the end of the world and about the unthinkable becoming reasonable. It's gritty, disgusting and believable. Talented acting, incredible makeup and riveting storytelling. There are characters I like and some that I just despise. This is the only show I have ever seen that makes me yell things at the TV. Yes, this is indeed Zombeh Cinemah at it's finest.

B004TRKH9O|5.0|Perhaps no other album better defines the aims and techniques of kosmische musik than Zeit. As Julian Cope explains in his Krautrocksampler, \\"...its remarkable unchanging unfolding near-static barely-shifting vegetable organic-ness takes over the room and permeates the whole house...the room in which Zeit is playing becomes that room.\\" To say that Zeit is otherworldly is understating the matter considerably. These are the sounds the stars make as they exhaust their nuclear fuel and collapse inward through the fabric of space itself to some inscrutable fate. These are sonic portraits of yawning alien vistas, hymns to the staggering distances between the island galaxies. Zeit evokes ancient memories of our extraterrestrial origins, visions that are at once immense, incomprehensible, profound, amorphous and utterly cosmic. The sustained cello note that slowly emerges out of the silence at the beginning of \\"Birth of Liquid Plejades\\" resonates like some fearful cord of memory being struck at the base of one's brain, dredging up dim shadows of mystical transfigurations from the inorganic to the sentient, from nonexistence to being. Like an iceberg slowly forming, the piece adds layer upon layer of sound, eventually drifting into an interlude of stasis and calm supported by Edgar Froese's plaintive organ and the aqueous flow of guest Florian Fricke's modular Moog. \\"Nebulous Dawn\\" ushers in Eno's ambient music program a decade ahead of schedule. Rising out of a primordial drone, the piece quickly turns into a lysergic nightmare, visualized in sound and transmitted on the radio waves of the subconscious mind. Its detuned bell tones klang ominously atop a background of carefully mixed and modulated electronic sounds, ranging from high-pitched shrieks and sub-harmonnic rumblings to disembodied moans and the spectral effluvia of ectoplasmic generators. Both \\"Origin of Supernatural Probabilities\\" and \\"Zeit\\" are similar in design, though more minimalist in execution. Quiet and introspective, both of these tracks utilize primarily the same sound sources from \\"Birth of Liquid Plejades\\" and \\"Nebulous Dawn,\\" yet achieve a more muted, autumnal effect. \\"Origin...\\" and \\"Zeit\\" take on the character of phantom landscapes lost somewhere on the border between consciousness and unconsciousness. Listen to Zeit one evening when you're taking a dip in the isolation tank, and you may never find your way back to reality.trospective, both of these tracks utilize primarily the same sound sources from \\"Birth of Liquid Plejades\\" and \\"Nebulous Dawn,\\" yet achieve a more muted, autumnal effect. \\"Origin...\\" and \\"Zeit\\" take on the character of phantom landscapes lost somewhere on the border between consciousness and unconsciousness.

0061478784|5.0|I first learned about the existence of the book after learning that the Miyazaki film was inspired by the story (go ahead and chide me, faithful readers of DWJ). Since borrowing the book from my library two weeks ago, I've read it four times through and have found it equally entertaining all four times. Re-readability is a common factor in my favorite books. Although this is a young adult novel Dianna does not dumb down the content nor the humor. I'm a 20 year old in college and I absolutely love this book. The characters are believable, the descriptions are vivid, and the pace moves rather quickly. I can't stand slow-moving books.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book to anyone. Really, anyone. I can easily see parents reading it with/to their children and laughing out loud.

However, I felt the author did a wonderful job of depicting Jacob- the perfect sullen teenager.<br /><br />I did think the book was well written and certainly kept my attention and the ending, while surprising, was a good conclusion to this tragic story.  As far as courtroom drama though, Scott Turow is still my favorite as far as gripping me in a trial situation.  So, this book in no way was the best courtroom drama I've ever read.<br /><br />All that said, I will probably track down the author's other books, as this book was a decent read.  After reading all the hype about this book, it really didn't meet my expectations.

B003EYVXV4|4.0|DISCLAIMER: This review sets up the situations of the movie without revealing the ending. But reading the book first is highly recommended.<br /><br />If you take the reality show \\"Survivor\\" and re-imagine it in ancient Rome, you might get the idea behind \\"The Hunger Games\\", a televised contest where 24 teenagers compete to be the last one standing. There's one catch, however. They earn that victory by hunting down and murdering the others. The story take place in a futuristic dystopia called Panem where the central authority, \\"The Capital\\" demands that the twelve formerly rebellious outlying districts send two \\"tributes\\"; kids between ages 12-18, to battle in the Games. All are picked by lottery. Once chosen, they are pampered like modern day reality stars before being sent into the forest with whatever weapons and supplies they can muster.<br /><br />The story focuses on the brave and resourceful Katniss Everdeen (played by the extraordinary Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteers to take the place of her younger sister. The first few scenes are excellent and chilling. Katniss's home, District 12, is an impoverished coal mining backwater that eerily mimics the Appalachian locale of Lawrence's last film, the equally bleak \\"Winter's Bone\\". The children are chosen at a staged event, called a \\"reaping\\", at the train station in a vignette that echoes (deliberately, I assume) the Selection Platform processing at Auschwitz.<br /><br />Once at the Capital, the story sags somewhat. This is supposedly where the rich, venal rulers congregate but, adorned as they are with exaggerated costumes and grotesque florescent hair styles, they look more like extras from a Fellini film. They come off as silly, not threatening, especially Stanley Tucci as the unctuous Ryan Seacrest-like MC who is cursed with a blue-tinted pompadour. The entire sequence is meant to mock the celebrity/reality show culture of our present day but it comes off a bit forced. In the book, they look as bizarre but their malevolence is more apparent. The only character who radiates menace is Donald Sutherland's President Snow and he is dressed in plain formal attire.<br /><br />The story picks up again when the youngsters begin to battle although it's unsettling to see children casually slaughtering each other. Katniss is paired with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson in a tender, underplayed role), a boy from her home district and their love story, ruthlessly exploited by the show's controllers, provides the backdrop for what transpires.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\", the beginning of the trilogy by author Suzanne Collins (who also wrote the screenplay), promises future sequels which will hopefully give more back story to Panem's beginnings and more challenges for the riveting and poignant Katniss Everdeen. These stories are aimed at teenage readers and it is easy to see their appeal. Combining elements of love and heroism, it also plays out every teen's revenge fantasy of getting back at the creeps who ignore them in the cafeteria and bully them in the hallways.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I found this book by accident as I was skimming through the list of recommendations and was struck by all the five star reviews which you don't see too often. The story had all the usual suspects from vampires, witches, shape-shifters, etc but the comparison ends there as the plot contained many individual threads woven together to form layers upon layers of history and mythology. The Wicca religion was interesting as was the concept of reincarnation and I have not read many books that touched on this subject. Sophia was an engaging girl who was persecuted for her beliefs just like the witches of old although she did not know this at the time. Being a \\"Forever Girl\\" was both a curse and a blessing allowing Sophia the opportunity to know and protect herself as well as those she loved. Charles is the romantic vampire lead and there is a triangle or sorts but not in the traditional sense anyway. The other characters in the book have depth and stories of their own. There are many twists and turns and information is revealed a little at a time so as not to overwhelm the reader. I never like to give the story away so whilst this review is a bit vague, I wanted to keep the anticipation and suspense for those of you who have not had the pleasure of reading this book yet. If you want a great book that is original and compelling, this book should be one of them.

Despite the description and shot of the cover, the Kindle edition does NOT include the 50th anniversary material at this time. Purchased and returned for refund.

B006QS0PF0|5.0|those dark, ugly thoughts and actions we tried everything not to face. Portia point out every detail of them. by finishing this book, it is such a relief to know there is a way and possibility to be true to myself. and being ok with who I am.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am a very big fan of Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey is the very best I've seen. I recommend it to everybody.
0312641893|4.0|Uh, dystopian half-metallic Cinderella. Rock on! What a creative story. Marissa Meyer really took this retelling to a different level. This world-building has so many awesomely original aspects that I don't know where to start. Cinder is a part-metal orphan owned by the widow of the man who adopted her, who, of course treats her like a slave. She's a mechanic, lives in New Beijing (old one has fallen) living under an Emperor ruling, who is fighting off war threats from Luna (yes, the moon!) while he struggles to find a cure for the plague that's been killing off the population.There's more! Luna-born people have magical abilities like glamors and mind-controlling!<br /><br />So much to take in, right? Yet Meyer does it in such a smooth way that everything just clicks and, weirdly, even makes sense. She even stays very glued to her Cinderella concept, which I was so immersed in the story that I sometimes forgot. Characters were well developed and very likeable. I loved Cinder's ability to be quite normal under such awful circumstances and still manage to be somewhat of a strong heroine.<br /><br />I also loved how modern social issues such as immigrants, difference, acceptance, politics and so on, where neatly woven into the story as well. It marvels me how much stuff Meyer was able to put into this tale without making it sound awkward or too much. This is a fully-enjoyable, wildly creative, feel-good retelling of the fairytale we all love. Part dystopia, part fantasy, part sci-fi, part romance, this is a book for everyone.
B000002AZZ|3.0|I adore Leonard Cohen and have been listening to him for at least 40 years, BUT somehow I missed this album along the way. It's okay, but definitely not his best work and not one that I'll play over and over.
1439102732|5.0|love that every single person in the book has her/his own way to look at life. the story line is realistic and touching. in the end, to each and every one of us, it's all about the meaning of love and what makes it  home. that really are way more important than sexuality.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the new gravity defiying angry birds game is the best it keeps me entertained for hours. if you like any of the other angry birds games you will love this one. highly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must for all fantasy fans. The other two following books are an awesome continue of the first one. Can just recommend it.
B005ERWYH6|5.0|Adele is my new fav singer.  I love her beaty songs and the lyrics are so very life lessons.  She is cool, in a new way.  Love how she drops off the first letter on some words, like Love, she says ove.  Listen to her she does it to lots of other words.
0486284735|5.0|it is a light, simple, kind of fun story line, but strongly pointed out the bitterness of two people being not fitting in the socity back then, and the sweetness of their love. most of all the bitter-sweetness of hoping Jane Austen herself could be in the happy ending of this story forever.

B007ORU2BY|3.0|In typical Mad Men fashion nothing really happened in two hours of television but the cast looked damn good, and they did it (nothing) super cool. It was a disappointing season premiere. I hope and trust that the season will get better after this slow start.
030788743X|5.0|This novel is filled with allusions to prior video games, books, movies, and nostalgia but even without catching the references it doesn't deter from the book. It's very well written and makes you want to sit down and finish it all in one gulp!<br /><br />Somebody once asked me to relate this book to others and it's a tall tale but it's one parts hunger games, one part .hack//sign and one gallon of the era of the 80s with a touch of adventure, romance, and pac-man.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I thought this book was wonderfull.  I never wanted to put the book down, as it was so exciting.  Great writing as usual Mr. Grisham
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was so looking forward to the 5th book in this series...at first I didn't realize that there would be a 6th book and was soooo disappointed.<br /><br />I hope the 6th book wraps up all the loose ends left at the end of A Dance with Dragons...and it gets released soon!

0761169253|5.0|Steal Like an Artist being a quick read, really packed a punch for me. As a designer, sketchnoter and writer, it's easy to get in a rut and lose track of where creativity comes from. Austin's little book was a creative spark for me. Within the 30 minutes it took to read, I was excited about creating and sending copies of this book to friends of mine.<br /><br />If you're looking for sparks to get yourself creating, this is the book to buy, read, and give to a friend.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|A fun new Angry Bird game. Too bad it cost $3 though. I regret it immediately. Gamed like this should never cost more than a buck.
006621131X|5.0|Great Read:  I'm a big fan of artist memoirs and biographies of artists.  Of course it makes it more interesting to read the travails of Joan Mitchell and Willem de Kooning when you know that by the end of the book they have become lionized by the museum culture and the media, most of whom are not artists.  It's not easy doing what Patti Smith and the above have done; try it.  And copying is a lot easier than inventing .<br />There's also a good DVD called New York in the 50's which has the same flavor; with stories about the writers and other artists of that time.<br />I think it's exciting to read all the people Patti Smith met and knows; and all the literary references just indicates the depth of her passion and knowledge in that segment of the art world.<br />----Fin
