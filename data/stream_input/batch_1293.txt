B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app. after we got multi-color highlights on the same page I was happy. if I had to ask for something else it would be a more engaging voice on the audio bible portion. I would even pay for it if it was good enough.
0440243688|1.0|Jack Reacher where have you gone? I have read all the books about you, detailing your exploits, and enjoyed most of them. \\"Gone Forever\\" is undoubtedly the worst of the lot, unbelievable people, unbelievable actions. You were a man of action, here you are a man of reaction; we must wait for the enemy to do something before you are stirred into action. We may need to know the specifications of the New York Subway cars, but in such detail? You can kill nineteen men (sorry, the NYPD took care of seven) but the twentieth man is just tipped off to proof of his existence when he makes his move.This one man upsets the balance of power, but fear not, more is yet to come, like two knife wielding women who discard more powerful weapons for the ability to inflict torture. And how else did Reacher get here? He stripped a pistol for its shells, then did not use them. He sets his preferred weapon for multiple shots, not single fire, this is sickening, I can not go on, the book is ridiculous but I read it all because I am a Reacher fan. How can this continue, how can it retain my loyalty? And yet look at the reviews, over a hundred five star. Chacun au son gout!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I am a fan, but I must say this is a stinker. There is not an interesting character in the bunch and the story and conspiracy is boring. I'm forcing myself to finish b/c I paid 10 bucks for the overpriced Kindle edition. A real disappointment.
0307279189|5.0|I am not an ultra runner nor do I think I will ever complete a marathon, but that didn't make this book any less interesting for me. The author's frustration with injury is something that I experienced when I began running and his quest to find a solution was enlightening. This book is an inspiring read in more than one way and I think all types of readers and runners would find something worth reading in this book.

B000V5ZI9M|5.0|\\"Put a phaser in my hand and I will kill Kira.\\" ~Benjamin Sisko. *  Star Trek is great science fiction because it has great stories.  This is one of those.  A classic mystery, never before thought up because it's pure Science Fiction.  It kept me on my toes the whole time, cause I had no idea what was going on till near the end.  However, it doesn't have much to do with the story arc, because there really was no story arc yet defined in Season 1.  4.6/5 Stars.  This is one of the better episodes of Season 1.  ~Keep On Trekkin'!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Another Jack Reacher novel, what more needs to be said.  Lee Child does such research you believe everything Jack does and you know that isn't possible.
B000V5SIFS|5.0|To know what Star Trek is all about is simply to watch this episode.  There is some great TV here that I loved watching. It is the depth added to Science Fiction that has always made Star Trek great. Gene would have loved this episode!  Cons: No Space Battles, phasers, or everyone in peril.  4.8/5 stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'

B006INDTAQ|2.0|Or just plain BAD?<br />First half of movie was OK.<br />That portion was mostly white hat/black hat,<br />punch 'em in the nose stuff, kick 'em in the groin stuff.<br />But then the unbelievable nonsense started. Come on,<br />jumping on a flying saucer? That may be a task<br />for Spider Man; but a bowlegged cowboy?<br />Harrison Ford must be hurting for work to accept such a<br />part. I wonder if he is embarrassed to have his name<br />associated with such dribble.<br />If you are in the mood for brain-freeze, then this<br />might be right up your alley, uh, canyon.

B004EPYZUS|2.0|MI4 is one of the most badly-executed and implausibly-plotted films I have seen in a  long time. The list of gaffes is enormous and ongoing. Two IMF members infiltrate the Kremlin; when a bomb explodes, one barely escapes, but the other one gets out, without explanation, unscathed. When Tom Cruise disguises himself as a Soviet general, his IMF pal says that he looks \\"exactly\\" like person he is imitating, when he looks only vaguely like his photo. A character falls out of huge skyscraper in Dubai, yet no police arrive to investigate. A character climbs up the outside of the skyscraper in broad daylight, yet no one in the building sees him, and the film does not bother to establish that the place is empty. The IMF team learns its mission to infiltrate the Kremlin barely four hours beforehand, yet happens to assemble a highly technical array of gear designed for that very purpose.<br /><br />Tom Cruise tries hard to give the film some sense of peril by having some of his gadgets malfunction. Yet, again, while a simple reason could be constructed (e.g., equipment damaged in an accident or sandstorm) none is given. We are led to believe the ludicrous possibility that the infallible IMF gives its agents untested and second-rate equipment. Speaking of gadgets, the number of one-of-a-kind, highly sophisticated gadgets that the agents leave behind is astounding. Problem one, they leave behind them a nice trail of computerized gizmos. Problem two, the electronics presumably are classified, and would help the bad guys if discovered. And tell me: why does the head bad guy want to start a nuclear war between the US and USSR? 10 points if you can remember without having to check Wikipedia or IMDB.<br /><br />When the film runs out of gadgets, it relies on glurges to lend itself depth. One agent mopes around, thinking he is responsible for the death of Cruise's wife. Another agent is tormented by the death of a member of her team. C'mon, folks. You are pros in a dangerous game! The after-mission debrief is not only interminable, but dopily misty, formulaic and melodramatic.<br /><br />I could go on. These are not nitpicky issues. Any halfway sophisticated movie watcher is going to wonder how characters know, say, the layout of Kremlin underground passages without seeing them  bone up on it. MI5 does not just stretch credulity, it snaps it and snips it into tiny bits. The couple of decent plot points - the razzle-dazzle with the bad guys in the Dubai tower, for instance -- are quickly obliterated by an avalanche of improbability and unexplained plot twists. Tell me how an inexperienced man can make a picture perfect jump into a whirling, 10-foot fan.<br /><br />But there I go again. Skip this lazy and ridiculous film. Even on video. Do not watch!ief is not only interminable, but dopily misty, formulaic and melodramatic.  I could go on. These are not nitpicky issues.

B000AARKOO|5.0|This is one of the greatest films on a grand scale since the likes of 1492. Unfortunately if your discipline is history and you are dogmatic about history or you are one of those that cannot see the film without Charlton Heston than you will miss it in total.    Kingdom of Heaven is one of the great Films of the 2000's.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I heart Lisbeth Salander!<br /><br />Take this from someone who never read Stieg Larsson's books or saw the original Swedish version of this movie: Dragon Tattoo rocks!<br /><br />The film is basically a murder mystery. Forty years ago, in 1966, a 16-year-old girl disappeared without a trace from a large, wealthy Swedish family. A recently-disgraced journalist (Daniel Craig) is approached by the girl's uncle (Christopher Plummer) to look into the case. The case is complex because though the girl's relatives all live on a small island, some are reclusive ex-Nazis and the rest are not talking to each other. Meanwhile, back in the city, Lisbeth Salander -- a young  punk girl, tattooed and pierced -- is undergoing her own difficulties with the social welfare system. She is anti-social, lesbian and tough, but a heck of a hacker and researcher. The movie takes off when she (played by an Oscar-worthy Rooney Mara) and Craig team up to crack the case.<br /><br />The film is dark, edgy and very rough. Shot in monochromes, it exudes a sense of cold and isolation that matches the spirit of its characters. The plot contains very frank depictions of sexual abuse and rape, and the dialog is rough as well. This makes the characters, especially Lisbeth's, very real and multi-faceted. Lisbeth is one of the darkest heroines to emerge from a fiction writer's pen. She is small and fragile, with nearly translucent skin and an air of fatalism. Yet she is strong and resourceful, capable of outwitting her victimizers with a (perhaps) put-on madness that nears psychotic levels. Not a young lady to be tampered with.<br /><br />Great film, even if the Plummers and Craigs can't match Mara's soul-seared intensity.
B0063IH60K|4.0|a nice, mindless game to relax with. graphics mimic actual solitaire layout as i would use w cards - i definitely recommend it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love it. the game works well and keeps you thinking. easier than regular solitare. recommend the download for those interested.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The complete 8 movie set for $50 was a real bargain, so perhaps I shouldn't complain. And I certainly didn't expect any bonus features or special items often included in individual DVD sets, but after watching the first four movies again from this collection (I had seen them earlier on TV) I was rather disappointed that certain scenes are missing in these editions.   For example, in \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" the scene where Harry accidentially lands in Dervish & Banges instead of Diagon Alley and witnesses Lucius Malfoy selling items from his forbidden collection is not included. And in \\"Goblet of Fire\\" the scene where Snape rounds up students making out in the carriages during the Yule Ball is also not included.   Otherwise it is a great collection and worth the money, but die hard fans may want to get all scenes when they buy the movies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I thoroughly enojy playing solitaire, it's fun and easy to use. there are different settings for different challenges and multiple ways to personalize it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is really really really really really really really really good. It was very amazing considering it wasn't a real book.

0385341008|4.0|Once you get into this book it is very interesting and it gives a new perspective into the German occupation of areas in Europe during WWII.  It opens our eyes as to what can happen when we do not pay attention to local, national and global affairs.
B005HSL626|1.0|I liked this game, and my kid did as well, but the frequency of the ads is overwhelming.  Every single screen change, it wants to take you to another page to sign up for this, get that.  I've played many ad supported games and generally have no problem with them, but this was overwhelming.  Also, a number of the ads were NOT safe for children.  I let my 6 year old play on my kindle fire, and she loves fruit ninja, but I had to delete this once there were several ads (ones that blacked out the entire screen and only offered a click on the link option, we had to back arrow out of it) suggesting that we could \\"talk to hot girls.\\"<br />While she loves the fruit ninja, we will not be getting this game again.  There's a fine line between ad supported and ad overwhelming.  Take a hint from Angry Birds, et al, where the ads are much less intrusive and pervasive, as well as less obscene.

B005OK722U|3.0|Not a bad film but certainly could pass without the \\"Hostel\\" association as it really just doesn't feel like a continuation of the franchise. A little let down as I was expecting alot more, but overall not a bad film as I've mentioned beforehand. A good, locked in a warm house as it snows outside type of movie, and that's not a bad thing...
B0063IH60K|5.0|enjoy playing very much, like all aspects of the game. Really like the help to figure out how to win the games.

B0061S073A|5.0|Since my kindle is linked to my email and credit card I really don't want my three year old to inadvertently access the Internet, which can happen frequently on free app games that he likes to play.  I am SO glad to have found kids place app because I can put only the apps for my 3 year old in it, set that as home for as long as I'm logged in and then hand over my kindle to him with no worries whatsoever that he will access anything he shouldn't.  I really love it.
B005EL6SUG|5.0|This train is my son's 3rd, and although a little pricey(probably due to power functions) it is a great addition to my son's collection of 2 other Lego trains, The Emerald Night and Cargo train.  Although it was rated up to 12 years, and it didn't take my son, 14 years old, as long to build it as the others, he was sufficiently challenged, but did not need my help at all.  It is much faster than the Cargo train, and he has enjoyed it alot.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I purchased this item for the holiday season. The item was shipped and arrived in timely fashion. Great deal and thank you.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I have tried a lot of video streaming apps, zumocast, vlc, splashtop remote (not strictly a streamer but it can serve as one), androrb, gMote, orblive, and now plex.  Plex is BY FAR the best.  The only close competitor is zumocast but plex gives so much more information about the media, huge amounts of metadata available, easy identification and editing of movies, and gives me so many more options for sorting,  etc. its really a great application.  Its just for media, so it'll only work with music, pictures, and video but that's all I really want to have access to because for everything else I use dropbox.  With the newest version they finally support easy streaming from your home computer (I've only tried the win and linux server but the apple server is supposed to work too) and I can set the bandwidth.  Haven't found a file it won't play, avi, xvid, mkv, wmv, and mp4 all supported.  The newest version makes it hands down the best for media.

B0063GORYU|5.0|this runs just like it should. no problems and have enjoyed having this on my mobile phone. very good app.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are great for running/working out - they're so light and they stay put. They last about 9 months and then I need new ones, but I also throw them around a lot in my gym bag. I usually buy a couple at a time. They're worth it...
B005TPCQ5I|3.0|The acting is superb. The plot is very interesting. But there is no character development, there is no build up of the emotions. I expected much more from this movie.  I think that one should watch it but not expect to be deeply emotionally involved.
1451627289|3.0|Does any book need to be this long?  I'm 1/4 of the way thru and can't wait to finish.  Not because the book is so good...but because there's too much description and not enough action.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|great, product was sealed and in great shape. it got to us on time and the price was great. recommended this to several friends.
B005I6EVUG|3.0|This is a very nice cover but do not be deceived. My wife was looking at buying this cover at Best buy and we both thought that it was great because it had a magnet to hold it closed. She bought the cover and installed the Kindle Fire. The \\"magnet\\" would not work, but we later discovered that the cover itself did not have a magnet in it. It was actually the two pieces of packaging material that it came with. It is still a nice cover but we both feel a little deceived by the way it was packaged.
1451648537|5.0|Another very well written book by Walter Isaacson.  I have been a fan and follower of Apple for since 1985, when I saw my first Macintosh.  Living here in Silicon Valley, the news and stories about Apple are everywhere.  Isaacson brings a fresh perspective to a much discussed personality.  Particularly important in the book is how he treats Job's famous \\"Reality Distortion Field\\" and his legendary outbursts / anger.  He does not apologize for them or gloss them over.  Instead, he presents it as a fundamental part of who he was and, more importantly, that it was central to the innovation that led to the great Apple products.  My only criticism of the book would be that it felt as if the first part of the book (of Job's early life, the founding of Apple, the creation of the Mac, and Job's ouster) was more \\"complete\\" than the second part of the book.  Indeed, the second part of the book which covers his resurrection at Apple, and the creation of all the cool products - iMac, iPod, Iphone, etc., felt a bit rushed.  The latter seemed more of a collection of stories than a comprehensive narrative as the first part was.  I know that the date of the book was pushed up when it was feared that Jobs would pass away soon.  Although the author claimed the book was already completed, it almost felt like the second part of the book was rushed to completion.  Nonetheless, the entire book is a fun read and I found myself up late on several nights just wanting to get though one more chapter.  It will also make you wonder if Apple will be able to innovate as much as it has without this complex, charismatic leader.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Only played one person mode. Like the unpredictabilty of the moves played. Seen bugs w resuming a game, otherwise good app, especially for free.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I don't think I've ever seen a book review on Amazon with a greater volume percentage of 5- and 4-star reviews. At the time of this writing, there are about 122 customer reviews, and all but 3 or 4 of those are 5- and -4 star reviews!<br /><br />This book deserves every bit of love and praise it gets. The plot is covered by many other excellent reviews already here, so suffice to say for anyone who is a fan of animals, people, human nature, and American history, esp. our country's involvement in wars...this book is just a fine, fine book.<br /><br />I started reading it unaware that it was a young adult novel. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it, never felt talked down to, never felt like I was reading a \\"children's book\\" as others have called it here. Not sure what that says about me - I am a simple person, and I like straightforward, honest, to-the-point writing, and this was it.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the book was that it was told from the voice of the horse, Joey. Somehow this device was not silly and cloying, this is NOT a \\"talking horse\\" a la Mr. Ed. The horse is the narrator, and I've got to be honest: I'll never look at a horse the same way again.Heck, this book even changed the way I look at my dog. More sensitively, I think, and more respectfully.<br /><br />Recommendation: Two thumbs way way up.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a knife!  You will not find a knife like this (for the money) that will bring you so much satisfaction and confidence. Truly, there is a reason why everyone owns a Becker BK2!  Your collection is not complete until you own one of these heavy, powerful and simply functional knives. No matter what you own, this will find it's way to the top of your collection. It's a \\"12gauge knife! ;-)  *Wish I could say the same about the sheath. It sucks. I will find or make an entirely different sheath. I have to, as the one it comes with is too tight and has a flimsy belt attachment. I wish it were leather instead of Kydex trap that won't let the blade go! You will hate the sheath as much as you will love the knife~
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Save yourself the time and effort and purchase the UK version.  The US version has problems which several on here have already shared.  The UK version is packaged better (sleaker) and the picture quality is superb and no kinks!  I purchased the US version and like many others had to bring it back to the store for a refund after haggling with the store manager and proving there was something wrong with the disc and not the firmware of the Blu Ray player that so many retailers try to convince customers with.  Many have returned the product to the manufacturer and at least (for now) Fox is honoring the return of these discs.  This is the quintessential collection of 4 (or eight if you included the directors cuts) outstanding movies (yes, I loved both Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection) that look absolutely beautiful.  It's amazing to see these movies in this format after seeing them on inferior formats all this time and discovering all these little details you didn't notice at the theatre or on DVD.  Highly recommended for any collector who loves older films shown in all their glory via the Blu Ray format!!
0140177191|5.0|For lovers of romantic Arthurian stories I cannot but recommend this one. The only setback in those days should be the fact that it is written around the Roman Catholic religion which may be hard to understand. M.Z.B. creates a very believable Morgaine who is not the Black Magic woman she is normally called in history. I cannot call it a historical novel as it is not clear what period in time we are talking about. But Arthurian fits it quite well. A remarkable book.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|The Pet Sounds box set contains a lot of \\"studio chatter,\\" although the voice doing almost all of the chattering is Brian Wilson. At times I found the process a bit tedious, although Pet Sounds was certainly deserving of such an in depth look. There are sublime moments therein, particularly the stacking of the harmonies on - I think - Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder.)   This set is something else again. It opens the door all the way - finally - to a process that is of real historical significance. That door had been locked by Brian for decades, although numerous bootleggers kept coming through various open windows, providing some fulfillment to those of us whose desire for more had been insatiable since we heard the glimpses that slipped out over the first few years after Brian essentially shut down business as Producer and his Golden Age was over.   Smile's mythic status grew gradually. First, there was Smiley Smile, which gave us pared down versions of Heroes and Villains, the sublime Wonderful, ruined in the middle by an inexplicable Beach Boys \\"party\\" conversation, and Mrs. O' Leary's Cow, having been lightened up in the form of \\"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter,\\" while still somewhat dark, having been softened by a cartoon-like quality. Also present were simplified versions of Vegetables and Wind Chimes, and of course the pre-existing chartbuster, Good Vibrations.. Later albums would tease us further, an unreleased snippet of Vegetables resurfacing, transformed, as Mama Says,  Our Prayer and Cabinessence, sounding startlingly different from the rest of 20/20, Cool, Cool, Water and the incredible Surf's Up, which had turned Leonard Bernstein's head five years earlier.   Many questions were answered long after the surfacing of countless bootlegged, incomplete versions of Smile when Brian finally decided to go back and finish it. Why did it take so long? Because the Smile sessions were at once the pinnacle of his creative output and the catalyst for his undoing, the effects of which were so traumatic that it  took him almost 30 years to face the energies that accompanied his peak and, at the same time, his psychological undoing. In my review of that 2004 release, I posed that perhaps the support that Brian had - and still has - in his wife, Melinda and his uncannily perceptive and intuitive band - gave him the strength to go back and face that pivotal time in his life. And now, I find myself thinking that since he was able to put Smile safely into the past by finally completing it, in so doing, he stripped it of its threatening vibes and was then ready to engage in a project that required his going head to head with the original tracks.  An incredible stroke of luck for us.  There are two overwhelming experiences that I've had with this set. One, of course, is the music in its relentless detail. (If you get this set, you can safely dispose of all your SMiLE bootlegs.) Having had the chance to hear much of this material long before the release of this set, I was afraid that there wouldn't be enough new material to justify the three digit price tag. And in a way, there isn't, but accessibility to all the surviving recordings gave this project a narrative flow that none of the bootlegs even get close to. We now have on discs 2-5 a step-by-step evolution of all the songs presented cohesively as a completed SMiLE on the first disc, following Brian's 2004 conception, as has been noted elsewhere.   All of this detail gives us two big gifts: First, of course, it provides front row seats to the growth of these incredible songs from sketches to masterpieces. While I have enjoyed the whole collection, a particular standout for me is Brian's solo Surf's Up, recorded in the fall of 1967 when the project had been essentially abandoned. Its majestic power and raw emotive depth and intensity are simply stunning. I've never heard Brian sing more beautifully. Another noteworthy track is the eight or so minute piece of tape, presumablypresented unedited, of Mrs. O'Leary's Cow, which allows us entry into the raging inferno to find...flutes! It's amazing to hear those flutes alone and then to re-experience them in the context of the whole. One marvels at Brian's imaginative powers.  And that brings me to the other big gift here. Nowhere else will you be able to get so deeply into the way this genius thinks in terms of composition and orchestration. You hear little fragments change, sometimes quickly, other times gradually, as Brian moves his musicians, moment to moment, toward what he experienoces as the way the piece should sound. And for a man not known for his articulate manner, his language, expressing what he wants, is precise, direct and profound. He notices things that perhaps he alone would ever have heard.   Sometimes there are hints of the unraveling, not in his way of addressing his troops - he always seems in complete control and command - but in how he seems to occasionally get lost inside a song to the point where he is no longer in touch with the way toward fruition. The most obvious example of that is Wonderful, which begins with the gorgeous changes equal to any classical music and then degenerates into a silly tangent with doo wop vocals and the repetition of the absurd phrase, \\"Come on baby would you rock with me Henry.\\" The juxtaposition of the sublime and the ridiculous is jarring. Happily, the song ultimately found its way back to an arrangement that reflected its extraordinary, concise beauty.  To sum it up, this is a journey worth waiting for - and worth taking again and again. Although the project was never finished, it reveals Brian Wilson's genius at its absolute peak.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|\\"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\\" is the fourth iteration of the Impossible Mission Force movie franchise, and it might be the best.  Of course, it features the IMF racing to save the world, using the latest in hi-tech spy gadgets and featuring some mind-blowing action sequences and special effects.  But this one works because the casting is about right.<br /><br />Tom Cruise returns as IMF veteran agent Ethan Hunt, who at the start of the movie must be liberated from a Russian prison by lovely field agent Paula Patton and tech whiz Simon Pegg.  Hunt is needed for a mission inside the Kremlin, which goes badly wrong.  Things get worse when the Secretary really does have to disavow all knowledge, and Hunt goes on the run with the Secretary's twitchy personal intelligence analyst, superby played by Jeremy Renner.  Screen time gets spread around nicely, as each agent gets a chance to contribute to the action.  The team banter provides some humorous breaks, especially the dialogues between Renner and Pegg.  Intriguing side plots add to the suspense.<br /><br />Operating under instructions known as the Ghost Protocol, Hunt and his ad hoc team have to short-circuit an attempt by a Swedish scientist to start a nuclear war. If the premise is just a little preposterous, the movie more than makes up for it with a breathless series of nail-biting action sequences.  Like any good IMF plot, it's never quite clear how things will work out, and the suspense should keep viewers glued to their seats to the end.  \\"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\\" is highly recommended as a good old-fashioned thriller.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I was so happy that this came so quickly! I am a fan of the show and love that i now have it at my fingertips whenever i want it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|81 days until the major motion picture! With over 2,000 reviews, there probably isnt much more that I can say except that this book was absolutely amazing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire triology. I read all three books in 4 days! And i must take credit for getting 4 other friends hooked as well. Collins masterfully delivered a set of characters that caused gut wrenching emotions the entire 4 miserable yet wonderful days.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great movie, Great seller, even better price.... couldn't ask for more . ordered on 12-23-2011 and received it on 12-24-2011 !!
B0058VW36U|5.0|even though I'm a kid, I love this game. I think people like me would relate to this game 'cause we don't like boring apps like paper toss. it keeps is entertained. esspecially my 4,5,6, and 7 year old cousins. only my opinion though. ;-)
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app. It kept me occupied on a 6 hour flight. This app is perfect for children, teens and adults. I recommend this app.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|This is a nice knife. It's made of 1095 carbon steel so you know it's going to be strong. It come pretty sharp, but can be sharper. The pouch is great for storing all of your survival goodies like a fire steel and a knife sharpener. The scales aren't the best but they do feel nice. It works pretty good and it's heavy. Good backup blade for your main knife.
B002BJGYTY|4.0|This season has two of my favorite episodes in it, \\"That'll do, Pig\\" and \\"Face-off\\". That episode has the eldest Lorelai, Rory's great grandmother, played by Happy Days' Marion Ross. Watching the relationship between her and Emily is hysterical. This season also has way more Jess and a lot less Dean which is a major plus for girls who like the bad boys.
1439107955|5.0|I want to add my voice to the chorus - singing the praise of this book and its author.  I learned so much from reading it.  I am a homeschool Mom and I will definitely be including much of what I have learned from The Emperor of all Maladies in my son's 10th grade science lessons. I feel the author has struck just the right tone here, not too much detail that would fill the book with lots of medical terminology that would intimidate someone who is not a scientist,  but enough to captivate and inform a general reader.  Parts of the book unravel like a mystery, other parts feel like a trip in a time machine and throughout you feel like you are putting the puzzle together.  I will never look at Cancer in the same way, after reading this excellent book.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|I thought this was going to be another Taken. It wasn't. It was a good movie and definitely worth the watch but there was no real connection for me with any of the characters. At the end, it reminded me of Total Recall and I liked that movie better.
B005KMX866|3.0|Early in Chris Isaak's career, there was a common critical dig that Chris was a slavish Elvis impersonator with a jones for Roy Orbison heartache. His videos for \\"Dancin'\\" and \\"Blue Hotel\\" did little to dispel that notion, despite that his second album had already shown Chris to be an astoundingly good singer and rapidly coming into his own as a songwriter. \\"Wicked Game,\\" which out-Orbisoned Roy finally pushed the comparisons aside and made Chris a star. But he never shed that love of the Sun Sound, which followed his albums as he delivered them over the last three decades.<br /><br />It's on \\"Beyond The Sun\\" that Chris pays homage to his old 45's. A chance comment by Sam Phillips that he was a fan of Chris' musical style and sincerity made Chris decide to gather his band, bone up on those classic Sun Studio 45's and make a trip to Memphis to record them on their home turf. I went for the double disc edition as a long-time fan and, while not disappointing, feel a bit awkward at rating the set higher than 3 stars. If you're going to dig into classics from Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, or Jerry Lee Lewis, you have to wonder if Chris wanted to claim them for himself or just make a record of tributes? \\"I Can't Help Falling In Love\\" (Presley) is such a stunning recreation that you could easily fool friends into thinking it's the King himself. Johnny Cash isn't quite the same, but Chris takes \\"Ring of Fire\\" and does little to change the song from the sound of its original single.<br /><br />Lesser known material fares better. Songs like \\"Dixie Fried\\" (Carl Perkins) or \\"So Long I'm Gone\\" (Warren Smith) help to balance the familiarity factor. Chris also chips in an original titled \\"Lovely Loretta,\\" a cool bit of Memphis swing. Michelle Branch shows off her chops with a duet on \\"My Happiness\\" (Presley), a highlight on the set. All across \\"Beyond The Sun,\\" Isaac delivers convincing performances and shows his reverence for the material. It's thoroughly enjoyable, just don't expect transcendence.n't expect transcendence.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. It really showed Shia LaBeouf's acting ability. In the first films, Sam Witwicky was just the geeky guy that got protected a lot. In this film he did more than just running around and figuring out puzzles. His fight with Patrick Dempsey's character was very satisfying to watch. This was the only one of the series that made me cry(when the autobots said goodbye to Sam, *tears*)
B0063IH60K|5.0|pretty good app keeps you busy and everything seems to work well. Doesn't seem to use too many resources. I like it
B002BJGYV2|3.0|This season started with Dean being back in Rory's life, so annoying. Ended with Rory leaving Yale after stealing a boat. Just a bunch of \\"WTF?\\" in this season. Season 6 is destroyed by the lead in from season 5. Just a very disappointing season, still better than other shows but the worst of the Gilmore Girls.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I can no longer flip my tablet upside down and play while charging!!!  I am going back to the free version. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Makes me think and I can watch t.v. while playing. The game was free too, which makes this game awesome.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this for my new grandson.  The normal pacifiers would fall out of his mouth and if they hit the floor they would bounce and sometimes be very hard to locate.  We lost one under the bed for a month!  This has been wonderful.  If he spits it out it stays right close by.  Plus, he has a little something to hold onto for security.  I actually plan on ordering a second one to have around because we and he loved it so much!
0307593312|3.0|Before reading this I scanned some reviews that described the work as an intricately plotted masterpiece. I should confess that I am brand new to Murakami Haruki.  I enjoyed the book. However, it does not need to be 1,040 pages long--its length is not due to any sort of an intricate plot. The plot is no more complex than that of a typical Robert B. Parker novel, in my opinion. The length is due to copious description of everything from putting a record on a turntable to the clothing/appearance of various characters. Interestingly, in the book the editor makes a point to Tengo that in writing, what is important is to clearly and carefully describe what the reader has never experienced, and to spend less time describing what the reader knows well. I think this is interestingly because Murakami himself flagrantly violates this \\"rule\\" (of course, it is not his own rule, clearly, but that of one of his fictional characters).  Anyway, I did enjoy the book. I lived in Japan for a while in the 1980's, so particularly enjoyed Japanese aspects and familiar (to me) settings used in the book. I appreciated his specificity in referring to various locations. It is rare for me to read a book that is set in a place I know well, so that was fun for me.  If you want a good mystery, read The Beekeeper's Apprentice instead!  I don't think I will seek out further reading material by this author, however ...
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I take back a move before checkmate happens, but it registers as checkmate regardless of even check happening. look into undo moves process...
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is great, and I was happy to pay 99&cent; to get rid of the annoying ads. My 3 yr old kept accidentally hitting the ads when he was playing.
B004EPZ02A|5.0|THis movie is honestly the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life, and i watch a lot of scary movies. The movie builds up the anticipation greatly and pulls off the scares perfectly. There is an actual story behind it and the movie isn't just a bunch of scares with no plot. This is, in my mind, better than the first two in every single way. I have never screamed in a movie and it was bad at the theatre when i was with my friends i wouldn't let go of my friends arm cause i was so scared and when i let go of my friends arm there was a sweat mark on her sleeve, that's how scared i was. This movie is amazing.
B004ZNB12O|4.0|Anyone who says Pink Floyd is not a band that should have a compilation because most of their music is intended to be heard seamlessly on their original concept album are people with a contradictory logic who completely overlook the extensive singles the band has released over the years.  If the band had such a problem with songs being picked off of albums and played separately, they wouldn't have released as many singles as they did.  Obviously, the band doesn't have a problem with compilation albums as they gave their input on this and ECHOES: THE BEST OF PINK FLOYD.  So the people who think they're above listening to this album, get over yourselves.  There.  Just thought I'd get that out of the way first because this album is prone to get crappy undeserved criticism such as that.  Anyway, this is pretty much just a condensed version of ECHOES, with the exception of \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\" and \\"Have a Cigar\\" (the former shockingly missing from the 2001 compilation).  The selection is pretty decent; \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Learning to Fly\\" are usual suspects, and it's nice that \\"Hey You\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\" is represented though their conclusion isn't surprising.  What's really nice about the album is hearing how cleverly the songs segue and transition.  When we hit \\"Fletcher Memorial Home\\" is where there are some problems.  Really?  Is the song really that good?  It's obviously just an excuse to represent THE FINAL CUT; its purpose is fine, but the album could be represented better by Waters concert staple \\"Southampton Dock\\" or single \\"Not Now John\\" or even the underrated closer \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\".  The new edit of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" is also really annoying since it omits part four in its entirety, yet the cover lists \\"Parts 1-5\\" when is should list \\"Parts 1-3, 5\\".  Part 4 is such a cool section, and I love Gilmour's wicked jazzy guitar solo.  \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\" is just a waste of a minute-and-a-half, a prelude into \\"Brick 2\\"--the radio edit would easily be welcomed here, allowing time to be saved for inclusion of another song.  \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" also strangely sneaks its way on another compilation, a poor choice given \\"Breathe\\" or \\"Us and Them\\" were cut.  Surprisingly missing is \\"One of These Days\\", \\"Sorrow\\" and something off of ANIMALS.  Perhaps \\"Set the Controls\\" and another Barrett song would've been in order.  All in all, the album accomplishes what it sets out to do, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get into Pink Floyd's music and also fans who want a fun mix.
B000002U9L|5.0|I LOVE David Bowie and this movie.  While the orchestral-type music definitely has an 80s feel, I still think it is a wonderful soundtrack, especially the tracks Bowie wrote, those are even more marvelous. A good soundtrack for all ages and a must have for Bowie fans.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game is just ok. The touch sensor is nonresponsive at times. Ok game for wasting a little time. Many different games to choose from.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i absolutely love this app! i use multiple times a day. love that i can use to add notes online and on my kindle fire
0446547654|5.0|I love all of Nicholas Spark's books and this one was no exception. I immediately got lost in this book and read the entire thing in 2 days! I work full time and I have a 4 year old, that isn't easy to do! The ending was a little predictable, but still it was a great ending!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|too good to be true is finally false.  who knew that free could be this great. I cant put it down
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its an ok game app. nothing fancy. works well enough to pass the time I guess. the games u get with points could be spittle cheaper.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|This is a great case for the Kindle Touch. I would agree that it may be a little big for the Kindle but the enclosure is snug. I am not sure what the reviewer referring to magnets is talking about. They got the wrong product as mine has velcro. If you have a Kindle Touch and don't want a case permanently on your Kindle this is a great option!  Jim
B00029D0B0|1.0|This set contains a lot of tiny parts so overall quality should be beyond the highest expectations.  But in reality most parts require finishing touch before they can be glued together. Basically it requires some fixes before it can be assembled.
B003L77GGA|5.0|The final season... but credit must be given to the show for wrapping up many loose ends this season and also for laying the groundwork for Clark to continue to grow up and become the Superman we know.  Lots of extra/bonus material too.  One can only hope that this cast will reunite for some Smallville/Superman/Superfriends movies down the road.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Along with the windows version and the mobile version, this provides great versatility and ease of use across multiple platforms.  Don't go anywhere without it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|btw, shadynasty is not my real name. I put it ing by accident. I &lt;3 this game. I especially like the points system.
B004EPYZXK|1.0|Not worth the full price.  Wait for it to (soon) show up in the $5.99 Blu-Ray bin.  It is kinda of boring (and I'm a space/NASA geek).
B0056BU3I2|4.0|It wasn't the best movie we've seen, but it had plenty of action and we did enjoy watching it. The movie was entertaining even though you might say some of the action was a little far fetched.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is great! there are tons of fun games to play and its easy to win and unlock new ones :)
1451627289|1.0|I am amazed at the number of positive reviews.  Like others have said the book is dull and boring.  There are long sections of unnecessary dialogue that adds to the frustration.  It could have been a lot better with some editing.  Nobody needs an 800 page novel.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|We love Ron Paul in Austin,Tx!!  Great album Kelly we have been big fans since day one!! Keep up the good worK!
B0017HMF6W|4.0|The attributes of Blu Ray cannot be diminished; North by Northwest has never looked better.  The muted color palate, which I always wondered about when seeing this film on video, is as detailed and accurate as has ever been reproduced in a video transfer.  The biggest disappointment for me, as a film student, was the Ernest Lehman commentary.  Granted he did write North by Northwest and its very valuable to have his commentary. But he offers little or no insight into the making of the film.  He tends to repeat himself and talks extensively about the working relationship between himself and Hitchcock, but his observations about the film are for the most part obvious plot points that anyone can glean simply from viewing the picture.  I wish the manufactures of this DVD had chosen, as they did with other classics like Gone with the Wind and with Citizen Kane, to include a film scholar's commentary on an alternate channel.
B002SAS26E|5.0|Decided to try this game based on others reviews. Have to say we agree. It's a fun two player game that my husband and I have been enjoying playing. Challenging and variable enough to stay interesting yet easy to learn and play. Recommend for couples that are looking for good two player games.
0316056863|3.0|I won't write a long, pedantic review.  Tina Fey's book is funny.  No surprise, right?  But, it is an incredible mish mash.  You couldn't really call it a memoir.  She does detail the story of her life-what she wants.  But, it is all fits and starts.  She jumps into it and out of it.  there is some history, then an excursion.  What she says is funny enough, but it is clear she hasnt decided what type of book she is writing.  You've got a salad of auto-biography, essay, musing, rant, travelogue.  It is a little bit of everything.  Also, like a lot of celebrity  books, it was not given the time it deserves.  Ms. Fey has a very funny voice.  But when it is all done it sounds like a series of interviews jelled by a semi-clever ghost writer.  I think I'll go watch 30 Rock.
B0026OR1UK|2.0|This book is OK. It complemented a book that I loved \\"The Art of Changing the Brain\\" by the James Zull.  That book focuses on the learning cycle and the brain.  This book, \\"The Talent Code\\" focuses on the thickness of the myelin sheath on the nerves in the brain.  This book didn't have enough scientific data to justify the $13, but I'd have liked it had I gotten it from the library....
B005HS00V4|1.0|What a huge let-down! This concert is unwatchable in one sitting. It's so boring I fell asleep the first three times I tried to watch it, and had to set it aside for a while. There is no energy, it's like Pete is reading a eulogy rather than singing in a concert. The female accompaniment was likewise poor. For me this was a huge waste of money, I will probably never put this disc in my player again.  I'm truly amazed that some people have given this title a good review, different strokes I guess.  Jay
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|First of all, I didn't read the book on which the movie is based, so my judgment of the film is based simply on the film itself.  I get the whole premise that we are seeing only a \\"slice of life\\" in the lives of this couple--one day each year.  And yet, I felt like I missed something important that must have happened during the intervening 364 days.  Throughout, we hear them say what good friends they are, but I'm left scratching my head as to how they became friends.  Much less how they fell in love.  On a more positive note, the lead actors are beautiful people and it was nice watching them.  Umm...that's about it.  Seriously, don't waste your time on this movie.
B004ECDNJU|3.0|I got frusterated with this game rather fast.  I wish it didn't have lives, it's challenging enough on its own.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using evernote for a couple years now and love it. It's fast and more useful than it probably should be. because of the near instant syncing between my computers and devices, I can transfer notes, docs, epics, recordings etc and have them ready to go anywhere. With the text recognition I can just snap pictures of pages or business cards and search through them later (text recognition is a paid feature). Anyone. with multiple devices and or computers should download evernote. Its free version could easily cost $10 for the download and still be worth it.
B005HSL626|5.0|very additive! my finance and I took turns trying to beat each others scores. very smooth and love that you can unlock different things when you get highscores. love this game overall
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. Easy to play. Lots of options to choose from. I like the &quot;winning game&quot; option, so if you're having a rough day you can win a game of solitaire for a &quot;pick me up!&quot;
B0058VW36U|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I've played it on my old phone for the first time so I bought it right away when I saw it for the kindle. Great graphics, addicting game play, smooth transitions, cute character! I love everything about this game! a very good buy for only .99!
B000V6MQV4|4.0|I recently rediscovered this and it reminded me of everything that used to be great about Maroon 5. Their lyrics were so genuine with funky, indie beats. Lyrics that tell stories and involve you without resorting to gimmicky stutters. My favorites are This Love, She Will Be Loved (a huge song with brilliant vocals from Levine), and Sunday Morning but the whole album is cohesive. Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it's fun and easy. I would tell anyone who is anyone to get this game. that how fun it really is.
0446560065|5.0|I bought this for my daughter since we are fans of the You Tube video's of Simon's cat.  Simon's cat is typical of how cats behave and we laugh every time we watch them, so why not have a book to look at anytime.

0307914550|3.0|I love running, and I love trail running.  I had heard about this book from others so I decided to give it a try.  In my opinion, the author skips around too much and it is extremely difficult to follow.  It is not a cohesive work, because it jumps around from setting to setting and doesn't have good transitions to lead the reader/listener to each diverse setting and character.  I ended up buying the book in order to finish, however, it is taking me a long time to get through, and frankly, I am losing patience with it.  This could have been a great book, with less detail and if he had cut out of lot of random musings and occurrences.

B005IU1OMA|2.0|I was so looking forward to this movie, and kept waiting for it to get better, but it just never did.  If it wasn't for the disappointment (and maybe that's my fault), I'd give it three stars.  There was more filler than action, some filler was way out of context (seemed like I was watching another kind of thrill movie), the mix volumes made the dialog too mute and music too grandiose and annoying, the team didn't work well, never seemed to gel, fighting, making mistakes, etc.  I admit that it was heartening to see them work through their disagreements, and interesting to see the heli ice up and get stuck on a ridge - kudos to all of them for saving that situation and surviving.  This movie would've been better if made as a documentary than presented as a presumed epic ski/board movie to thrill and entertain (for that, I really enjoyed Attack of La Nina).
B0055S348W|1.0|this app duznt have my printer model. wtf am I supposed to do? waste of $12!!!! I want my money back now!
1451627289|5.0|A fantastic read.  Great characterization.  Lots of history.  A wonderful love story.  A compelling plot.  I've never read a Stephen King novel and reading 11/22/63 makes me want to read more, though I understand this tome's unique in his corpus.  I highly recommend this wonderful book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is just like the computer version of the game, its fun to play and has many different settings to chose from. I recommend his app... its free so there's nothing to lose and you get exactly what you expect.
B0060V1WJ6|2.0|All my friends wanted to see this movie.  I finally gave it watched it, and I was expecting something better from Julian Moore for being a high caliber actress.  Then I remembered Alex Baldwin's quote that actors are like plumbers who don't make money unless he/she performs the job, and can't pick and choose always when they have bills to pay.  Slow and not funny and very predictable.  Watch it with no expectation.  Only remotely funny part was when they were having a parants meeting with Marisa Tomei (the teacher).  what a waste of time and money.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I am from the Jackson, MS area.  I went to the theater and viewed this movie.  I bought this DVD because I wanted to be able to view it at home while experiencing the full emotional impact that this movie has on its viewers...especially its local viewers!  Great movie!!!!

This production allows one to see him in action, listen to him, and to be with him one last time.  I'm glad that he was allowed to leave this for us to remember him by!

1451627289|2.0|When I first started the book I could not put it down. I cried a lot from certain events and a weapon that I didn't expect. I got through a 1/3 of the book in a couple of days. When I got to the middle of the book, I felt it really got dragged out.  I understood why the book was written the way it was. It was like reading a journal. The stalking of Oswald was driving me insane.It was overkill in my opinion. I felt after 200 pages I got it, your stalking him. This caused me to feel detached from certain secondary characters deaths or injuries.I just wanted the book to go to the next level. I was very pleased with the end of the book. Once you get to April of 1963 the book goes back to a nail bitting page turner. The ending had a sweet touch. I wished the emotional impact from the beginiing and ending were in the middle as well.

B0058VW36U|5.0|In my opinion, this game is more entertaining than Angry Birds. Very addicting with unique, simple concept. well worth the  $0.99.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I like Dream Theater more and more each time I listen to them. Their Train Of Thought CD has some great songs on it, but I have thouroughly enjoyed the Octavarium Cd. All the songs on it are very good and very powerful in different ways, even though the songs range at times  from very mellow to all out metal.To me, however, the title track is the best 24 minutes in music. I have listened to this song over and over again and I am always amazed with the complexity and the quality of this epic. The other seven songs on the CD are excellent too. Although I really have enjoyed all of their albums, I think this is the best CD they have ever made.

B004LUS390|5.0|I got this application just days ago and I'm having a hard time putting it down.  I've been drawing and doodling since I picked up my first crayon sixty years ago and I love this app. If an old geezer like me can learn to use it in a couple of hours, it must be pretty intuitive and it certainly is fun!  I haven't mastered drawing in layers yet, but everything else I'm already using in my drawings.  The color palette is very versatile, the brush choices are many, and every brush and color can be varied by diameter of the brush and opacity of the color.  This is the first digital sketcher I've used and there may be even better ones out there, but this is just great.  I'm running it on my Kindle Fire and noticed that some other reviewers were having problems with it, but so far it works perfectly for me.  Great application.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is my first GPS watch and my first heart rate monitor. Reading the reviews I was a little concerned about the touch-sensitive bezel. However, I haven't had an issue so far. As an alternative to more buttons, I think it is a reasonable design. It does take some time to learn it (read the manual), and I am not all the way there yet. My impression so far is that the device heavily favors the GPS aspects of the watch over the HRM aspects. I haven't figured out how to set a HR zone and have alarms go off as I am approaching either the lower or upper limit during a workout. This is not necessarily a weakness, but just something to be aware of in the purchase decision. I am generally impressed with the web-based software that you upload your workouts to. It offers a number of ways to view your statistics, define courses, workouts, etc. I do wish they would go further in the \\"social\\" aspect of the software. Specifically, comparison to others in a similar sex/age/weight range would be interesting. The PC-based software is OK (I am on a Mac); actually a little better than I expected based on the reviews. The map aspect of the PC software is poorly implemented, however. The canned maps that it has seem to show only major roads in my area. Maps in the web-based interface are fine. These software issues could obviously be improved with updates, but I don't know how diligent Garmin is in this regard.  The wireless transmission of data from the watch to my Mac has gone fine after I got the right software installed. Finding it on the Garmin site was a bit more of an effort than it should be. You insert a USB key into the computer, and the software transfers the new data from the watch to the computer, and also uploads it to Garmin Connect (the web-based interface). My concern is losing that USB key! I wish they would have gone with a standard wireless technology like BlueTooth. Then they could still have a USB key for those whose computer is not BlueTooth-capable, but for those with a BT computer, it would not require any additional hardware.  I researched other Garmin devices and settled on this one in my budget (under $175). I am happy with it, and it satisfies my desire for more data about my runs/exercise.
0786939532|5.0|This book is the first of a series of 13 featuring the main character Drizzt Do'Urden and his amazing tale of what its like to be an outcast and his personal struggle to find his place in the world. This book is personally one of my favorites and is an amazing fantasy novel. If elves, dark elves, medieval esque melee combat, magic, and more sparks your interest this is a must read. The setting takes place underground, deep below the earths surface in the city of Menzoberranzan, a dark elven city. The city is matriarchal and has very involved social hierarchy that controls the political ongoings of the city. Each family has its own army and wage wars upon each other to gain power. The values of the dark elf culture are extremely selfish and all revolve around gaining personal power through whatever means necessary. To Drizzt, this all strikes him as wrong, but nonetheless he goes through his initial education and then takes matters into his own hands. This is a pretty fast paced yet detail novel and in my book is definitely a must read!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This movie takes the cakes in hysterics! It will have you rolling on the floor laughing no matter how much you usually feel bored during a movie. I hope this movie wins \\"Movie of the Century\\" because that is what it is! If you have a cent of a sense of humor I recommended you put this movie on your bucket list.
0060873027|1.0|The concept of this story is fascinating.<br /><br />The writing, the plot, the characters are all written as if conceived and executed by an eight year old.<br /><br />It's completely ridiculous and poorly written. The publishers should be seriously shamed for putting this trite piece of crap out there.<br />To think that some good writer somewhere was NOT published so that this junk could be put out is just criminal.<br /><br />I understand that there's some good science regarding miniaturization, and it's a fascinating subject. . . but this novel (and I use the term loosely when applying it to 'Micro') is trash.<br /><br />A complete waste of time and money. Buy another book, any other book and save yourself a headache from too much eye-rolling that you'll be doing as you read Micro.<br /><br />When commenting on novels by 'big-name' writers, Stephen King, John Grisham et al. . . this one ranks at the very bottom of the list.<br /><br />Also. . . this is an almost direct rip-off of MANY similar stories (and more well-done ideas along the same vein) to wit: Honey I Shrunk the Kids (which was stupid, but at least it knew it was comically stupid and not trying to be serious), Fantastic Voyage (from the 60's when there was no high-tech special effects and still managed to do it better than 'Micro'), The Fly with Jeff Goldblum (not exactly the same, but similar) and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />We, as readers, should all finally realize, and never fall for it again, when successful authors hire writers to help them pump out more and more and more simply to create a cash machine, or in this case, when the author's estate hires a writer to finish something that was put aside or never finished. It just NEVER works out.<br />Never again will I be fooled by this 'concept'.<br />Don't believe that? Then read some of James Patterson's assembly-line crap. Read the latest Tom Clancy. . . .

B0050KEVO6|5.0|Alchemy is an addictive app that enjoys much better game play on the Kindle Fire than on an Android smartphone.  This is due primarily to the additional screen real estate that is available on the Fire.  While some of the combinations are not at all obvious and others that seem obvious will not combine at all, Alchemy provides many hours of fun and pleasurable frustration especially when you compete with someone else to see who can create the most combinations in a given time.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|As I sat in the theater in anticipation of seeing the return of one of the most important parts of my childhood, I was excited, but very nervous. Would it be the Muppets that I remembered? Or just a shell of what I once loved?  To my relief, not only was it the perfect tribute, but it did what I did not think was possible and was NOT a retread. Yes, there were some reused jokes and songs that all Muppets fans would love, but there was plenty of new, clever, fourth wall breaking material that had me in stitches the entire time. Being a Media Studies major, I watch a lot of films, both good and bad. This has made me cynical in a lot of regards. The Muppets made me forget all of that. I laughed and laughed and laughed and felt for every character on screen. It was the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time.  I've noticed a lot of \\"reviewers\\" have given the movie a one star review because it \\"insults the Muppets\\". This seems to be from cynical people who forget what the Muppets were about. They claim being \\"cliched\\" yet fail to realize the film is mocking cliches. They claim Muppets \\"do not fart\\" yet forget that 1) woopie cushion humor was used in The Muppet Show and 2) the whole joke was that its NOT funny. I think some people just don't realize how clever this film is. Maybe they're just not smart enough for the Muppets.  And that's what I love. Kids will love the movie, but so will adults. I can't wait to own a copy of this film and watch it with my younger cousin so she can too can meet the Muppets.

0525423281|5.0|Okay, game over.  I really need to start reading more contemporary novels.<br /><br />I thought Stephanie Perkins had captured my heart with Anna and The French Kiss, but I guess I was wrong.  Lola and the Boy Next Door is the fantastic follow-up and I'm head over heels in book-lust with it!!<br /><br />At this point, it should go without saying that Perkins is a fantastic writer and she makes it incredibly easy for you to fall in love and empathize with her characters. This book is no exception.  From Lola's two dads, to her best friend Lindsey, I just couldn't get enough! They were so irresistibly charming and I wanted more, more more!  I'll even go ahead and admit that there may have come a point where I wanted to be friends with these people. Don't judge...I'm sure you've been there, too!<br /><br />Although, I have to say that my standout was definitely Lola, the novels protag.  She was quirky, smart and just chock full o' everything that is awesome!  I loved that she remained true to herself, even when it meant being the underdog or not always being liked.<br /><br />And then there's Cricket Bell.  SQUEE!! Pardon my drool, but where do I even start with Cricket?? He's funny, and nerdy, and too adorable for words! In my opinion, he may even have St. Clair beat.<br /><br />No hate mail, please :)<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a novel full of of laughs, happy tears, romance and even your fair share of surprises (read: cameos from a certain lead couple from Anna and the French Kiss *wink*).<br /><br />This book definitely made my year a little brighter and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />So....who's excited for Perkins' follow-up, Isla and the Happily Ever After (Fall 2012)??<br /><br />*points to self*<br /><br />THIS GIRL!

0385535139|5.0|This book takes us back to the work John Grisham did in the 1990's. The characters are colorful and sympathethic. The plot is complex with subtle nuances which keep the reader guessing. I enjoyed reading it from start to finish.
1451627289|5.0|Another year, another Stephen King novel. The first King novel I read was CUJO, in 8th grade, and since then I haven't missed a one. I was too young to read that book, but it did help speed up the aging process.  I look forward to each one and hope that the ending is coherent and relatable. For every THE SHINING and CUJO there's an IT and an UNDER THE DOME, books that have such great characters and structure that, when the ending is unveiled, there is a noticeable disappointment with a giant turtle or some such. 11/22/63, King's latest offering, has none of these concerns. The plot is basic, a man discovers he can leave 2011 and go to 1958 through a time portal - a prospect that gives him the opportunity to prevent JFK's assassination. Of course, there's more to the story than that, but I've never been one to provide spoilers; the beauty in this 850-page novel is the ins-and-outs of time travel and the protagonist's immersion into a culture that existed before he was born. Jack Finney's TIME AND AGAIN has always been one of my favorite novels, and there are echoes of that classic book in King's tome. It's interesting that both King and Woody Allen, two of our most prolific artists, both tackled time travel this year and both knocked it out of the park. 11/22/63 has been well-researched and has the nostalgic touches that King mined so well in books such as IT and the novella THE BODY. Speaking of IT, there are some over-lapping characters. So, bottom line, history, the 1950s and 1960s, time travel equals five stars.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is written in a such a way as to make you feel the magic and wonder of the circus. I found myself wanting the circus in this book to be a real place that I could visit. I could not imagine a more magical place. I loved the mystery and mystique of everything about this circus. However, I do wish that we could have gotten to know the characters more in depth but, the book is really about the circus (not the characters) - hence why it's called 'The Night Circus' and not 'Celia & Marco' or 'The Challenge'. I thoroughly enjoyed this story and felt it was written in a way that was different from any other tale I have read before. If you love true magic - wonder and imagination (not tricks of the light, slight of hand, smoke and mirrors or tomfoolery) - then you will love this book.
0307454541|3.0|This book held my attention but the ending seemed unrealistic. There were too many story lines that were tied neatly in a bow.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I don't usually write movie reviews, but this one made me so mad that I had to comment.  I watched the trailer for this film, thinking that it would be a good character study movie.  WRONG!  It was some abstract, modern art, poetry mumble jumble that was absolutely boring and disjointed at best.  I want my money back!  I love movies and I enjoy a really well written story.  There was no story, no plot, or anything.  It was like following someone's thoughts with landscapes and music.  I even hated the way it was filmed.  Honestly, this was the worst piece of crap that I've seen in a very long time and it should not be listed in the film section.  Unless one likes modern art, the only way anyone would rent this is because of the trickery that was used to make us think it's a movie with a story.  A waste of money and a waste of the time that I lost trying to watch it (and I never made it throught the entire film - fast forward showed me it was more abstract crap).
B00065MDSG|5.0|Much of this brilliant album is about the expression of dynamics -- that force in music that permits change, breath, variation. On this record, King Crimson may have taken that value to extremes, to the point that it irritated a lot of listeners. On \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One,\\" for example, the differences between the softest and loudest passages were such that, if you turned up the original vinyl loudly enough to hear the soft stuff, you were blasted out of your chair when the band turned up the volume.<br /><br />But that was part of the point here -- to make music that shattered the ideas of what \\"rock\\" should be, whether those preconceptions came from the record company, the audience or even certain musicians themselves.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very demanding listen, as Crimso albums tend to be. Together, the two parts of \\"Larks' Tongues ... \\" constitute 20 minutes of shifting, elusive, loudest-then-softest, time-changing, instrumental music, and they open and close the album. In between: Three vocal pieces, but of the three, only \\"Book of Saturday\\" is concise, at just under three minutes; the other two -- \\"Exiles and \\"Easy Money\\" -- provide John Wetton a chance to sing as well as play bass, yet, at more than seven minutes each, there's plenty of room for the band to stretch out.<br /><br />Then there's \\"The Talking Drum,\\" a nearly eight-minute instrumental that comes just scurrying out of the speakers. Driven at a fast clip by Wetton's bass along with Bill Buford's drums and Jamie Muir's percussion, the song also provides space for violinist David Cross and guitarist Robert Fripp to shine -- or in this case, to screech in a way I used to find annoying but have grown to love!<br /><br />I don't go to this album as often as I'd like; I find it DEMANDS my attention in a way that does not permit it to be used as mere background music. But along with Crimson's debut, plus \\"Starless and Bible Black,\\" \\"Red,\\" \\"Discipline\\" and \\"Thrak,\\" it forms one of the great little corners of my entire musical collection. I simply can't imagine not owning this.l collection. I simply can't imagine not owning this.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I really enjoy watching movies.  I don't care about the books they are based on nor do I care about the artistic value of the film.  I just enjoy a really good, solid story and fine actors.  I've been very disappointed this year because I feel like the films out there are the same movie about stupid and/or drunk people doing stupid things over and over again.  Hollywood is catering to the dumbed-down crowd for sure.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when this film came out on instant video.  Finally, a movie that held my attention.  It made me think and it made me laugh.  Even my husband (who groaned and complained when it started) enjoyed the film and said it was one of the best films that he has seen this year.
1594202842|5.0|I just finished the book and I am shocked by all the criticism. I imagine it stems mostly from envy and denial, unless of course your children are outstanding at something and attend an Ivy League or top 10 school. Do your children?  I suppose it has nothing to do with you, the parent.   The point of this book, to me, is that being very involved in your children's education and hobbies can lead to extraordinary success. How is everyone missing that point?   Most parents I know spend nearly zero minutes a day with their kids on their school work, spend no time with them on their hobbies besides driving them to practice, and let them spend all summer doing nothing and being brain dead! That to me is a horrible parent.  What brings more happiness? Being popular, social, and a cheerleader or the feeling from getting a standing ovation at Carnegie Hall? Wouldn't working hard at something and accomplishing a lot bring you a lot of confidence?  Would you rather have your kids get A's and B's and get into your state university or all A's and get into Harvard? Kids that get into Harvard have very involved parents.   Who would you rather talk to at a party, the average 18 year old at an average college or Sophia Chua? I can't even talk to an average 18 year old unless I am talking about television, music, or sports. I feel Sophia would be interesting to talk with, even at 18. Read her blog if you don't believe me. She is a bright girl with a great personality.   Stereo-types are generalizations. Not all chinese kids play instruments and go to Ivy League schools. Not all western parents raise their kids the same. If you want to find out the largest differences in parenting, look at economic class. Upper level income kids usually do better in school and are at higher reading and math levels. It is because those parents are often educated and value education. Many Chinese in the U.S. and in China do better in math, science, and other subjects regardless of economic class. Why? This book explains it---the parents are very involved.  No one can argue that the author is not extremely proud of her daughters. She also congratulates them when they are playing in a competition and celebrates with them when they win.   These kids were not homeschooled or completely out of contact with peers. They attended public schools and had friends. They were not threatened much more than any parent threatens their kid. You've never said \\"you are not having a birthday party if...\\" or \\"I am taking away all your stuff if...\\" or \\"I will spank you right here if...\\".   All kids are different and respond differently. But parents, like my father, was barely around growing up because he worked so much and when I saw him I didn't listen. I barely knew him and respected him. We barely had a relationship. Our relationship is great now, but being involved and having the respect of your kids is the biggest message in the book. And it is a great message.
B004T32SOK|5.0|first off, I a) am not familiar with dropbox, so its alleged awesomeness does apply to my review and b) am a somewhat casual document User, so I don't get too fancy with my needs. that said, for my kindle fire, with the quick office pro app and Box app, have all my needs met.

B002KAOSEW|5.0|I really don't understand all the one and two star ratings. This is the first Lee Child book I read, and I liked it so much that I've since purchased and read three more! The plot is engaging from the very first paragraph, and the characters are interesting. I like Reacher's attitude - a lot! The world would be a better place if we had more men like him in it. Sure, this isn't great literature, but it's a very entertaining story - well worth the money and time.

1451648537|5.0|It says something about a man who wants a biography written about himself and urges an established author to undertake the task.  It says more about the man who gives this author carte blanche without the prerequisite of reading and approving the final product.  Jobs did both and Isaacson's portrayal describes the power of human accomplishment when the genetic fingerprint of genius is complemented by the nurture of those responsible for its care.   Jobs was lucky.  His intelligence was recognized by adoptive parents who indulged its growth by paying the nerve wracking parental price of patience.  His intelligence was recognized and indulged by educators who bent the rules a little to foster his talent. Co-workers, friends and enemies were not indifferent about Steve Jobs. Whether they loved him or hated him they would all agree that he had an aura of intelligence that was readily discernible. Those who knew him might also say that this 'aura of intelligence' wasn't the only aura he emanated!  That's what makes this book so enjoyable to read.  Walter Isaacson comes across as genuine and forthright in his attempt to portray a complex individual whose disk operating system was genius and whose applications are left for all the world to use.  The reading of this book was time well spent for this sixty year old individual and I give it a special recommendation for folks my age.

B005J0VPNC|3.0|Simple, neat camera app. A small selection of cool filters. Nice user interface unlike a lot of the other, more fully featured camera apps.   There are some minor issues which could earn it 4 stars if addressed:  1 - There is no support for front facing cameras. The Andy Warhol inspired filter would be nice to use on myself. And many OEMs are moving away from hardware shutters for the rear camera.   2 - I pressed the email icon and my screen became a blur of banding colors. I have a Rezound, so this is probably why.

B006BQI1V2|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Sarah's Key features two alternating stories initially set in Paris, one concerning the fate of Sarah, a 10 year old Jewish girl and her family during the Nazi occupation in 1942 and another set in 2009 involving Julia, an American born French journalist, who has been researching the infamous Velodrome d'Hiver incident--a bicycle arena where thousands of French Jews were interned in squalid conditions after being rounded up by the French police upon orders of the Nazis.<br /><br />When Julia discovers that the apartment she and her French born husband are about to move into, bequeathed to them by her husband's family, is the same apartment that belonged to a Jewish family that had been deported, her interest in the fate of French Jewry in World War II becomes personal--something much more than just one of her journalistic assignments. Before you know it, she pays a call to an expert Holocaust researcher who is able to provide her with the names of the deported family, which includes Sarah and her younger brother.<br /><br />Perhaps the most gripping scenes in 'Sarah's Key' involve the deportation of the Jews during the infamous Parisian roundup. The horror is first aptly conveyed in the mother's panicked reaction to the French policeman's orders for everyone in the household to leave (including the children). As the police look for the husband (who is soon to be arrested when he returns home, unaware that the police have arrived), the two children sneak off into another room. Sarah inexplicably locks her younger brother in a closet and keeps the key, expecting soon to return and free him. Things get worse for the family when they're shipped to the Velodrome and they're forced to remain there for days on end, without toilets and in stifling heat. Frightened adults as well as children witness multiple suicides, as despairing deportees jump from the rafters. When the victims are transported to relocation camps, the full horror is conveyed when the parents are separated from their children and are driven off in trucks to death camps.<br /><br />Like many comparable films created by German filmmakers, the scenarists appear to be ambivalent on the subject of homegrown complicity in the Holocaust. One scene illustrates this ambivalence--as the Jews are being deported, one French woman calls out from the window of her apartment, in substance, that the Jews are getting what's coming to them. But another man, in another apartment, yells to the woman, 'they'll come for you next'. Similarly, the villainous French police have one good apple amongst their ranks--the one who allows Sarah and her soon to be dying friend, to crawl under the barbed wire and make their escape from the relocation camp. And yes, there's even a quid pro quo when it comes to villagers: before taken in by the kindly couple, there was that gruff, homeowner who sends the children away without helping them. By mainly focusing on the 'righteous gentile' couple who saves Sarah, the film's scenarists may be giving the wrong impression that there was a equal balance between the bad and the good. In reality, the 'helpers' were few and far between, in occupied France.<br /><br />While it was a bit of a stretch to accept the whole idea that Julia, a person who had already been researching Holocaust history in her job as a journalist, was now directly connected to a horror story involving her husband's family's apartment, the horror story itself proves to be far more contrived. I'm speaking of the whole idea of the kindly husband and wife who who decide to take Sarah back to the apartment to discover the fate of her brother. First of all, the husband wouldn't have had any trouble concluding that the child was dead already if he was still in the closet. So why would he allow Sarah to go up and open the closet, subjecting her to a trauma that haunted her for the rest of her life (until her suicide in 1955). Even more unconvincing is the idea that the husband and wife would have actually brought Sarah along to investigate what happened to the brother. How could they be so sure that the bribe would work when they were on the train? All the husband had to do was make the trip to Paris himself, bring the key and ask the new owner (Julia's husband's grandfather) to open the closet. As Sarah's discovery of her dead brother in the closet is the key moment in the film, and the events leading up to that moment are wholly implausible, the overall impact of the film is diminished.<br /><br />Events depicted in the present day also tend to lessen the film's overall impact. Should we really care about Julia's fight with her husband over whether she should keep the baby? Perhaps if the husband was a more fleshed out character, the interaction between the two of them would have been more compelling.<br /><br />Finally, 'Sarah's Key' asks the question, \\"what would you have done?\\" had you been under the yoke of Nazi occupation. It's instructive to compare the French and Danes during World War II. Denmark initially faced a much more benign occupation than France--the Nazis allowed them self-government and did not challenge them when they refused to enact laws against the Jews. But when the Nazis changed course in 1943 in Denmark, and a reign of terror did begin (similar to what happened in France), the Danes arranged for their Jewish population to escape by boat to neutral Sweden. In France, due to widespread anti-Semitism, there was little sympathy for the Jews to begin with and no such collective will emerged. The filmmaker's, however, hint that the majority had no choice to act otherwise against the Nazis.<br /><br />'Sarah's Key' does have some affecting moments particularly in its scenes involving the deportation of French Jews, but the film's central dramatic moment is too contrived to be believable.actually brought Sarah along to investigate what happened to the brother.

B000GIXEIG|4.0|This is a fictional interpretation of the great myth of the heroic battle between Beowulf and Grendel.  It is not a faithful film version of the famous poem, but an attempt to portray what may have really happened.  To be honest, it either clicks for you or it doesn't.  In my opinion, the story works, is plausible, and is supported by very good acting for the most part.  Subjectively speaking, I liked it.<br /><br />The story takes place in the thickest of the dark ages, when order in the western Roman Empire has completely collapsed, about 7C CE.  In the prologue, a band of Danish warriors encounter and kill a mysterious human-like creature playing with a hairy and ugly child.  They could be surviving protohumans, mutants, or indeed monsters.  The savage child is allowed to live by the King and emerges as an adult to seek violent retribution.  Meanwhile, the hero of a neighboring tribe, Beowulf, decides to take on the task of saving his old benefactors, who had raised him as an orphan.<br /><br />In this version, Beowulf is not a superhuman but an intelligent and compassionate man, who wants to understand his adversary, who is called a troll.  He is modern thinking without being an anachronism, which is something very hard to carry off.  He is helped by a tough witch (Polley), who knows the creature; she is the most weakly acted character, imho, but then I have never been impressed with her acting.  The spirit of the once-valiant and generous king is broken, lost in alcoholism and despair, in a wonderful performance.  Needless to say, what Beowulf discovers is unexpected, but he feels compelled to carry out his duty, particularly against Grendel's shreakingly inhuman mother.  The creature himself is also a complex character, for whom the viewer can feel a mix of revulsion and sympathy.  Meanwhile, a priest is converting the pagan crew to Jesus, which is rather comically parodied.<br /><br />This film adds a really nice twist to the myth.  Recommended.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have app. I love all the different versions of the Bible is just a tap away. If you have ever heard the Bible read out loud the audible option takes it to a whole new level. This feature is great for on the go. The new multi-color highlighting allows for quicker references to my notes. The Bible has been now made easier to navigate on my Kindle Fire right down to choosing a verse. Now all I need is bookmark tethering option and a split screen to compare dual versions to complete this great on the go Bible.
1400052181|5.0|This book tells the story of one woman's amazing cells and their contribution to medicine and tells the story of the woman herself--long just a name and a face in a sentence of medical textbooks--for the first time. It describes the author's quest to learn about Henrietta Lacks and the struggles of the Lacks family to learn about Henrietta. And it provides a glimpse of the sometimes messy intersection of science and humanity. This book is a page turner -- do not be intimidated by the fact that it is nonfiction or by the medical subject matter.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While I couldn't put the first two books in this series down for long, this final book was a little disappointing for me.  Too much reflection by Katniss and not as much action.  It seemed to muddle through to the ending.  Too much time elapses when she is trying to figure out how she's feeling at the end.  But still a good book. But I feel like if you haven't read the first two you'll be lost with a lot of the characters that she thinks about.

0385341008|3.0|I thought this novel started with just a few letters back and forward. It. Didn't. I had to push myself all the way through it. I don't know why it got over 1,000 5-star reviews. Sometimes details felt forced when it came to explaining people, events or places. I mean, normal people don't write to someone else to tell them absolutely every little thing.  They wouldn't care. Neither do I. I got over the 'letters' format very quickly.<br /><br />I couldn't attach myself to the book because I didn't know what it was trying to say OR what the point of any of it was. In the end, a conflict that started the novel(The point of the protagonist writing all the letters to research a new book) was never finished.<br /><br />This book could have been so much better if it was written in a mix of 'letters' and 'normal narrative' format.<br /><br />In saying these harsh comments, some characters are likeable, not all of the details are forced and so the world in Guernsey is amazing. And the core of the novel, the dreadful stories from WWII, is powerful.<br /><br />I say give it a go, choose if this type of book is for you.

B003R0MEZ4|5.0|With this new and outstanding Season 6 on DVD, Criminal Minds continues to impress with consistently excellent acting, writing, production and an unbelievable variety in its fascinating stories which somehow remain riveting, fresh and unique.  The actors who play the members of the FBI's elite Behavior Analysis Unit who track and catch serial killers and occasional terrorists are very believable.  In fact, part of the attraction is they seem to be a close-knit family of friends.  Anyone who watches a few episodes of the series will begin to feel close to those in the BAU team.  Each episode in any season will stand alone as a gripping story and an outstanding short movie well worth seeing.  Season 6 is no exception, even as JJ (one of our favorites) leaves and new agent-in-training Seaver comes on board.    We discovered Criminal Minds a little over a year ago watching reruns on cable TV and quickly became fans.  We went back and bought Season 1 on DVD and loved it, and have continued through each season, now through Season 6, and we feel this is one superb TV series.  As we went back and started from the beginning, we were surprised to see how much more about each character we learned by watching the shows in order during the course of a season.  Each show reveals a little bit more about the members of the BAU and their personal histories, backgrounds, personalities, and the more one learns, the more familiar and human they become.  One is drawn in and comes to like them, in spite of their flaws and foibles which are also exposed.    After watching the show through 5 complete seasons, and now Season 6, we are amazed that the show continues to be extremely believable, exciting and intriguing.  Somehow, the writers seem to draw from a well of serial killers with an endless supply of singular plots and interesting local venues.  Shows are shot on locations from major U.S. metropolitan areas to gorgeous rural landscapes, from LA to Detroit to D.C. and Miami, to Las Cruces New Mexico and rural Iowa.    The realism of the show is one of the keys to its success.  It can be shocking, and parental caution should be exercised, but it is one reason the show is so believable (along with great writing, production and acting).  One last thing about this series is the way the show looks at some of the hardest questions in life - why do bad things happen to good people?  Is the supernatural real (either supernatural good or evil)?  Are our worst criminals born with genetic coding they are helpless to overcome, or are they shaped by their environment and life circumstances, or do they freely make evil choices? What things are most important in life?  How does one be a good father or mother and still have a demanding professional life, or can that even be done?  How can one ever overcome horrible setbacks in life?  So, the show has a lot of things going for it.  At the end of the day, it is first and foremost extremely enjoyable entertainment that never fails to leave one wanting more.  Five stars are well-deserved for the whole series and for Season 6 alike.

B006RED4GA|5.0|With a pair of genuinely likable characters, and a creeping look at an old hotel going out of business, Ti West crafts another slow-burn horror masterpiece. Sara Paxton plays Claire, a bored and analytical young lady with a daffy personality and a weekend to be spent working the last shift at the Yankee Pedlar Inn. She is accompanied by the oddball and mysterious Luke, played by Pat Healy. Their chemistry is delightful, and very realistic, and the acting is absolutely terrific as well(especially on Paxton's part). They talk not of life, or any bigger situation than the one they're in, but of ghosts and the besieging spirits who walk the halls. Ti West beautifully writes a dialogue, and shows no life or activity outside of the hotel, which builds a sense of entrapment for the young duo, and the audience. Like Mr. West's prior film, \\"The House of the Devil\\", he ingeniously let's atmosphere take control, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the explosive final act. What makes the film so affective is the fact that Ti West doesn't dwindle the audience, he throws in no jump scares or loud, shrieking music. He lets what you see creep into your mind and settle until you're lying in bed later that night and forced to recapitulate the unnerving images you had viewed. This is the best horror film I saw during 2011, and perhaps one of my favorites of the year in general. It had me falling in love with horror films all over again, and most likely will do the same for you. It's streaming on Amazon right now for $10 dollars, and VOD as well. Do yourself a favor and see this fun, yet absolutely chilling horror film by the new master of horror, Ti West.

0385523904|5.0|With the recent death of Kim Jong-Il, I decided to buy this book after hearing so many good things about it and read it in one(long) sitting.  Demick's flawless weaving of history, narrative and characterization, this work of non-fiction reads like a suspense novel.  As a Korean-American of North Korean parentage, I have always been aware of the repressive and totalitarian regime of North Korea.  Like the South Koreans described in the book who are incredulous that the regime still remains intact, I and most of my family shake our heads and wonder by what twisted miracle this anachronistic government doesn't collapse under its own weight.    While I presumably have aunts, uncles and cousins still living in North Korea, my father was always expressly opposed to ever trying to contact them.  The scrutiny and potential persecution of family was not worth the selfish satisfaction of personal curiosity by discovering the answer to \\"whatever happened to ...\\" after the Korean War.  I suppose I am fascinated at the stories of defectors whose families paid the \\"ultimate price\\" so they \\"could drive a Hyundai.\\"  Of course, I am able to imply disapproval in those words having never known hunger pangs or hardship of any magnitude.    I was particularly interested in discussion concerning the North Korean cuisine.  I grew up eating North Korean specialties and call them by the North Korean names.  Pyongyang neng myung as described in the book was renown before the war and my mother, a native of Pyongyang, has taught me how to cook it in the North Korean style.  I am so saddened that those North Korean recipes will soon been completely lost since everyday North Koreans haven't had access to the ingredients for years.  As a bit of personal trivia, my mother once shook Kim Il-sun's hand and presented him with flowers as a young school girl in Pyongyang, which is now only a story good for cocktails parties.    My father died over twenty years ago, but he once predicted that his homeland would become open and reunified in 2012.  Why he chose that year has always been a mystery to me (the Mayan calender notwithstanding), but I have come to realize after reading the book that 2012 is the 100 year birthday of Kim Il-sun.  I put this in writing a day after the new year 2012 to see if my father had an unknown gift of prophecy.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|At first, it took a while for me to get into this book. I was bored by his adolescent years, but I guess it was needed to setup why he acted the way he did in the future. I just think it was a little too detailed about it. Also it seemed the beginning focused too much on Lisa, his daughter that he refused to acknowledge. It seemed that the author of the book was really upset about it... or maybe he emphasized it because he thought that Steve deeply regretted it. Either way, I was sick of hearing about it.<br /><br />About 25% of the way through, I could not stop reading it. Maybe that was because the technology aspect of his lift intrigued me more. Maybe it was also the way that he manipulated people or made business decisions that made it more interesting to me, but it ultimately made it a page turner and I could not put it down.<br /><br />Overall its a great read and if you remotely know who he is, you should read it.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Overall this is an awesome app, I would recommend it to people who like games that require quick thinking and solution solveing. It reminds me of a game I had for my Ipod touch, I think it was called &quot;Train Gate&quot; where you changed the gates to get the train into a barn.

B004A8ZWVU|5.0|I haven't seen a movie this good in years. The quality of this movie makes it an instant classic. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it holds your attention at every point in between. The story moves along at just the right pace and the acting is superb. Dallas Bryce Howard is excellent, her finest movie yet - she's the woman you'll love to hate. A thoughtful exploration of the experiences surrounding segregation and racism from a series of different viewpoints. One of those movies that \\"makes you think\\".
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Oh, snap, that's right, Alec Baldwin once upon a time was svelte, as so documented in BEETLEJUICE, the 1988 film that - along with CLEAN AND SOBER - made a case for Michael Keaton having a streak dark and dangerous enough to qualify him for the then upcoming Batman role.<br /><br />It can be tough when you're newly shuffled off that mortal coil, tough when the shelf life exceeds the expiration date. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Baldwin and Geena Davis) - a young couple in love - are freshly minted ghosts who find themselves confined to their quaint New England home, and they seem content enough with their new sitch. But when a family of obnoxious artsy-fartsy New Yorkers move into their house and threatens to annihilate their peace of mind, the Maitlands may have no recourse but to contract that shady freelance \\"bio-exorcist\\" Betelgeuse. Certainly, the Handbook for the Recently Deceased isn't much help. Adam and Barbara's irascible case worker Juno - who is supposed to ease them into the afterlife - worsens things by remarking that the Maitlands must spend 125 years on Earth in their house before they can move on. Anyway, it's a delectable twist, this meek and retiring ghostly couple being haunted - and bullied - by the living. BEETLEJUICE, as if you didn't know, is a hugely entertaining supernatural comedy. Harry Belafonte's catchy calypso music simply acts as a bonus.<br /><br />The Maitlands' bridge to the living is Winona Ryder's appealingly strange little goth girl, Lydia Deetz. Lydia is pretty much the only \\"house guest\\" that Adam and Barbara can tolerate and they, in turn, become surrogate parents to Lydia whose real parents (a shrill Catherine O'Hara, a distracted Jeffrey Jones), let's face it, tend to neglect her to bits. Lydia demonstrates an unnatural awareness of the ghostly Maitlands, and it's her curiosity which helps propel a major plot point - namely, Betelgeuse's getting his hooks into the Maitlands. Adam and Barbara prove to be too mild-mannered and just too nice to put a proper fright into the Deetzes - their idea of scaring the mortals is to possess them and make them dance to Harry Belafonte. Conversely, Betelgeuse embodies equal traits of perversity and meanness and he right away cows the Deetzes; the Deetzes' family friend, Otto, especially has it coming. But then we learn that Betelgeuse has his own nasty end game in mind, with no one but the Maitlands and the spunky little girl, Lydia, to thwart him. As likable as Baldwin and Davis are, Michael Keaton's awesomely manic, joke-a-second performance fuels the movie. He injects just enough demonic chops to come across as a sinister adversary.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton put Hollywood on notice with PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, and BEETLEJUICE only expanded his street creds. BEETLEJUICE exhibits Burton's bag of tricks - the distinctive style, the touch of artistic creativity, that smidge of the surreal and the fantastic. There's a lot of visual treats, ranging from the storybook look of the Maitland home to the bizarre architecture of the offices of the supernatural underworld. The dazzlingly inventive sight gags add to the film's offbeat humor. That waiting room is almost as diverting as the Star Wars cantina in terms of ambiance and their inhabitants. All in all, BEETLEJUICE is an astonishing, demented spin on the classic ghost story.

0061191981|4.0|Gordon Ramsay is of the new generation of TV chefs, a descendant of Julia Fields, and the Galloping Gourmet.  The first generation strove to bring a genteel comfort to housewives looking to improve themselves around their kitchens.  Gordon Ramsay brings little comfort to viewers looking to improve themselves.<br /><br />Whereas his brethren, like Anthony Bourdain and Adam Richman bring humor and a sense that they do not take themselves overly seriously, Ramsay brings a manic intensity to the small screen.  Whereas Bourdain writes books that stirs the reader to laugh with him, Ramsay brings no humor to his.<br /><br />I was drawn to this book from comments made by Bourdain in one of his books praising Gordon Ramsay as a chef and a restaurant operator.  As a writer, he is a pretty good chef.<br /><br />His story is impressive.  He has pulled himself up from an unhappy childhood, overcome a father who was a louse, and fashioned a career in food service after his soccer career fizzled.  But, he tells his story without humor.<br /><br />He spends more time talking about his childhood, and not enough talking about how he has built a dynasty of wonderful restaurants.  Where his television experience are probably interesting, and funny, he glosses over them.<br /><br />His downside as an author is probably what makes him great as a chef.  He takes himself way too seriously.
0553804677|5.0|\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is brilliant. The rich depth of the main character Locke, and his band of cohorts, the Gentlemen Bastards combines the best of Patrick Rothfuss and George R.R. Martin.   You quickly find yourself immersed in Locke's never certain personality and clever games. Camorr,the city where the action takes place is a vividly imagined Venician metropolis, the perfect breeding ground for the Right People- thieves, cut-throats, and the like. Lynch builds the foundation of his city on a rich ancient history. The spacing of the novel is excellent; it's a perfect mix of the history of our cast, the city itself, the current adventures of the Gentleman Bastards.   Something I really enjoyed about the novel was the obscenely low length of each chapter. It's constantly fresh and exciting, Lynch really outdid himself with the pacing of the story.   Of course, nothing is perfect. I found myself bored at times, trying to skim past all the intricate details of the city's architecture. Nevertheless, the rest of the novel easily outweighs these small segments. I highly recommend it for anyone :)

B0034G4P9E|5.0|Nick Nolte deserves to be nominated for, and possibly win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His heartbreaking performance as Paddy Conlon is not only one of the best performances of 2011, but a fighting comeback for the actor in every sense of the word. This is easily the most surprising resurgence of a once-great actor since Mickey Rourke appeared in The Wrestler and Nolte's performance is equally powerful.   Opening in theaters back in September, Warrior quickly disappeared after grossing only $13 million domestically. Mixed-martial-arts isn't exactly mainstream, the two lead actors aren't \\"stars\\" yet, and Warrior was marketed no differently from every other film of this sort. In the last few years, audiences have already seen The Wrestler and The Fighter rendering Warrior superfluous. Critics were good to it, but not good enough and the film has now been left to gather its following on Blu-Ray. I had heard the kind words about it, but watched it for no other reason than entertainment value. Imagine my surprise...Warrior is possibly one of the most underrated films of the year and certainly one of the best. It appears as nothing special, but it's an absolute knockout.   The film begins with an emotional confrontation that establishes the type of acting we'll see throughout. Paddy Conlon, coming up on his thousandth day of sobriety, comes home to find his adult son Tommy Rearden (Tom Hardy) sitting on his doorstep. Their relationship is obviously strained over Paddy's past abusive behavior and Tommy doesn't believe that he's changed. The next day Tommy is involved in a bout with a professional fighter and a video of it goes viral on the internet. There's an upcoming mixed martial arts tournament with a grand prize of $5 million dollars. Tommy begrudgingly asks Paddy to train him, saying \\"that was one thing you were good at.\\"  Meanwhile, Tommy's older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher with a wife and two daughters. A former UFC fighter, Brendan is struggling financially and finds that he has three months to pay the bank before his house is foreclosed. His wife is opposed to him fighting for money, but after he's suspended from teaching he's left with no alternative.  Warrior brilliantly spends the first hour following both brothers separately, taking time to establish these characters. Hour one is straight drama, while hour two brings on the action without sacrificing what grabbed our interest in the first place. Director Gavin O'Connor, who co-wrote the screenplay, is a director to watch for his masterful ability to handle character drama against the backdrop of men pummeling each other. He's made a movie that will appeal to both thinking moviegoers and...other moviegoers. More impressive is that Warrior uses the conventional, clichéd character arcs (strained father-son relationships, sibling rivalry, alcoholism) and story arcs (financial struggles, redemption) that make up this genre and spins them into a compelling, relatable drama that transcends these barriers to create a film that never feels too familiar. Warrior has all the makings of a good movie, but those involved elevate the material to greatness. Not bad considering it tackles themes and plot devices that we've seen endlessly since Rocky debuted in 1976.  I know little about MMA, except that it appears pretty intense and leaves little mystery as to why some of the fighting scenes are so brief. The first fight with Hardy is well-choreographed, quick, and exciting. It makes you want to see more and then it makes you wait. The scenes that come later are not only emotionally involving, but quite simply...badass. This is coming from someone ignorant of MMA and with no interest in watching UFC or anything of that nature. These scenes are exciting and triumphant, complimented by great editing and hindered only by the use of shaky-cam. It's not as overbearing as it has been in other films, but it's not necessary either. It doesn'tbring anyone closer to the action or make you feel more involved as an audience member; it's just a headache-inducing distraction. This fad of using it for action sequences needs to die a quick death.  Warrior provides two thoughtful dramatic conflicts that make the eventual climax all the more riveting. In movies like Rocky, Raging Bull, The Wrestler, and The Fighter you know who to root for while Warrior leaves you torn. Hardy and Edgerton are totally separated and do not share the screen until over an hour in. This confrontational scene is a tad melodramatic, some of the dialogue is shaky, but it gets the point across. It's just too bad the brawn loses some of its brain in this scene. Questionable execution of this scene aside, the performances are fantastic all-around. Tom Hardy is an animal and his rage-filled, sensitive performance is a great precursor to what we can expect from his portrayal as Bane later this year. Hardy's previous roles show his physical commitment and he's become very large and imposing here. It's not just the muscle he's accumulated that makes this a great performances, but the way he's able to convey Tommy's deep, emotional wounds using his eyes. Tommy isn't much of a talker, but his eyes speak volumes. In the emotional scenes, you can see quiet suffering behind them and in the film's climax there's just pure, animalistic rage. It's award-worthy for sure and a reminder of what great things Hardy will do as an actor. Nolte is heartbreaking, emotive, and sincere, playing a familiar character but using his own troubled history to add another level of pathos. If the Academy doesn't honor Albert Brooks for his role in Drive, they should be ashamed for not awarding Nolte. Brooks played against type and created a memorable villain. Nolte has made a comeback, reestablishing himself as an actor of indispensable talent in a performance that brought tears to my eyes more than once.  Warrior deserves more accolades. It never goes for easy sentimentand tells a complicated story against a solid, entertaining backdrop. It hits challenging emotional notes, inspiring a whirlwind of emotions that range from crying to cheering. With a stunningly poignant climax and an ending that gives you just the right amount of closure; few films of 2011 succeed on this level. Warrior is great drama, great action, and great entertainment, one of the best, most powerful films of the year.  GRADE: A

0439023521|5.0|I read this book because my friend recommended it to me. I honestly didn't want to read it at all because of the popularity its gotten, what with the movie and all. It's just not my thing to keep up with the \\"hottest trends\\". I bought it anyway to see why everyone was raving about it. I have to admit it was pretty good. The story line had me from the first chapter which most books never achieve. I kept reading and couldn't set it down. I soon saw why everyone I talked to liked the books. There was something there for everyone. Romance, Action, Mystery, Suspence. I loved every page. I never thought that a book about killing each other could be so amazing. I'm normally not into violence but for some reason I was captivated by the way Collins used the descriptions and related it to my generation. I kept thinking that I knew what was going to happen next but I every prediciton I made was wrong. That just made me love it more. The characters seemed amazingly well developed even if they were just minor characters. I felt like I could see every part of the book through Katniss' eyes. I thought this book was amazing and I wouldn't mind reading it over and over again. So for those of you that don't want to be a part of the crowd that keeps up with all the latest things, make this book an exception because it is worth all the great reviews it is getting.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Fun addictive game, that I have only a few complaints that keep it from getting 5 stars.  First several times I experienced a bug where my taps were not registering.  This did not happen often on my GalaxyS2 but enough to make certain levels impossible at higher speeds. Second level 17 is a bit too hard to get a perfect on  due to the random factor of the flame colors I kept getting stuck with 3 colored flames going around the track that I could not use.  This happened over 20 times before I gave up.  Finally the way the arrows turn takes a little getting used to...seems like a clockwise rotation would have made a bit more sense than rotating 180 then back 90 like it does.  At least throw in an option for this rotation.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|I loved this entire series.  I loved the way the characters grew emotionally and psychologically.  The plot kept me moving forward and at the same time catching me off guard and surprising me in a way that I loved.  I loved how we got to see inside Mac's mind and the struggling she had to go through to become the truly strong, courageous, passionate woman in the end.  I laughed and I cried with this book.  There were places that made my heart raw with the emotional roller coaster that played out in this series.  I don't mind that we don't know \\"what\\" Jericho is at the end.  I don't think \\"what\\" he is makes a darn bit of difference which is the point the author (IMO) was trying to make.  (Actions speak louder than words and see me!)    I loved how the message of everything changes and nothing is guaranteed was handled.  I loved how there was good even in the bad.  This felt like it's supposed to IMO.  Life is just like that, ever changing, no guarantees and a little bit of goodness in everyone and everything.  And while those messages may have been a bit to subtle for some, they are there.....just slow down and enjoy the ride instead of trying to get the answers before you really know the questions.  oh yeah....and the idea that none of us are one dimensional..perfect.  We're all made up by our experiences.  We're shaped and formed by many things and some of those things come from a place none of us will ever understand because it's in our DNA.
0307279189|5.0|I read this after not having run for 18 years, and I loved running. I burst into tears after the first chapters realizing I had maybe done the wrong thing by quitting. Doctors told me flat feet and plantar faciitis relegated me to orthotics and thick tennis shoes (which hurt my knees) for the rest of my life. But after reading this, I had the courage to start running again. First I tried the Vibram Five Fingers and got tendinitis from Too-Much-Too-Soon syndrome, but after a year of running in minimalist shoes, my feet did get stronger and this last summer I threw those off, too, and have been running barefoot ever since. I am a middle-aged woman so if I can do it, I think anyone can. I am up to 1.5 hours running on asphalt or trails, even trails with pea-sized gravel. Thanks, Chris, for a book that changed my life! There is no better feeling than running with the dirt between your toes and the wind in your hair (except maybe sex and chocolate)!<br /><br />Also, it's a fascinating story AND well-written.

B005HP2J66|4.0|Visiting a zoo a few years ago, I had the fanciful thought that human beings first learned to feel emotions by observing animals; or, perhaps, that they learned to express them by imitating the outward appearance of animals. I remembered this thought while watching Werner Herzog's latest, \\"Cave Of Forgotten Dreams,\\" in which he looks at the [[ASIN:0874807581 Chauvet cave paintings]], allegedly made as long as 30,000 years ago. The most striking thing about them is that they do not depict any human beings. Only one drawing is said to depict a human figure -- a naked female body with no head, apparently -- but I personally couldn't see any resemblance. The animals, on the other hand, are all recognizable and much more detailed than you'd expect from art made by cavemen. There are running horses, woolly mammoths, lions and so on. The horses are the most life-like. Some are shown whinnying, mouths slightly open.  The cave was discovered very recently, in the mid-90s. Some of the paintings are so detailed that I confess to an initial twinge of suspicion that this could be some sort of modern hoax. But then I thought, no, a modern sensibility would probably draw a bunch of stick figures and come up with some fake creation myths and war stories or something human-centric. But the paintings only show animals, thus feeding into Herzog's main message on the difficulty of understanding these distant ancestors' mindset. The paintings are almost like an animal mythology, showing their battles and migrations. But there is no clear sign that the cavemen worship the animals religiously; it's almost as if they don't really make any distinction between the animals and themselves. One tries in vain to imagine such a total lack of detachment. It is easy to envision some kind of primitive spirit-world religion with rituals and sacrifices and dances around the fire and so forth. But in some sense, those rituals already stylize the spirit world and draw certain lines between humans and spirits. The very concept of spirits with supernatural powers requires some degree of abstraction. It's harder to imagine living so totally in the moment that one doesn't perceive any boundaries, and maybe doesn't really even have a clear sense of one's self. Although the cave does contain a stone with lots of little handprints -- some kind of artist's signature, maybe?  Herzog's narration makes similar points. As you might expect, he brings out a few weird people to comment on the topic. One guy, referred to by the inexplicable title \\"experimental archeologist,\\" gives a rousing rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" on a caveman flute. Another guy claims that his lifetime of experience working with perfumes enables him to discover new caves by smell alone. This is mostly a distraction. Perhaps Herzog thought he needed some comic relief, or maybe this is his way of arguing that it is impossible for modern people to relate to prehistoric times. Or maybe he thinks it's deep, I don't know.  But he spends plenty of time in the cave itself, and has several long shots of the paintings. I did not see the movie in 3D, but even on an ordinary screen, you get lots of detail and colour. The paintings are monochromatic, but rich in shading. The cave itself is an unworldly sight, with unusual calcite crystal formations that take millennia to form. The calcite has preserved the skulls of cave bears who lived there thousands of years after the humans had left. Every Herzog film contains at least one indelible image, but here, all he has to do is let the camera run.  Also, I actually liked the ending in the nuclear hot-house, although it does feel simultaneously jarring and somewhat by-the-numbers, like a repeat of the iguanas from [[ASIN:B003B6OPNI Bad Lieutenant]]. Still, I think it gets across the idea that thousands of years present impenetrable barriers to communication. The use of crocodiles, which are recognizably alive to human beings but different enough to seem alien, is effective.   This is one of Herzog's more low-key documentaries. Still, some viewers may be annoyed that there isn't more factual analysis and information. Considering that this may be the only film footage of the Chauvet cave that will ever be allowed to be made, one can ask if it was really necessary to spend precious time on the guy with the flute. This is a momentous occasion that is not necessarily well served by Herzog's engaging, but unsurprising ideas about humanity. However, the film successfully achieves its most important objective of presenting the cave paintings, and then making the viewer think about whether it is possible to relate, and by extension whether it will be equally difficult to relate to our own culture thousands of years from now. And, well, those horses are really something.
B005KELQEU|3.0|I should have gotten one with a snap opening that stays around the Kindle while reading the book.  This has to be taken off and \\"put somewhere\\" when reading.  It defeats the purpose of reading while outside of the home, like doctor's office.

Their rendition of \\"Danny Boy\\" is truly fine - maybe the best I've heard.  But they should leave \\"Ave Maria\\" to Pavorotti - it was a bit too amitious for them.  Overall, a very pleasant album, but fades into background music category at times.

0307959856|1.0|To it's credit, the book does not have Elizabeth or Darcy fighting vampires or zombies. Other than that, it's difficult to believe that P.D. James's writing and plotting could be so inept. Be forewarned: This book is not a mystery. There is a murder, but there is no attempt to \\"solve\\" the murder (outside very dry courtroom settings). The characters don't even talk about the murder! The most verbal creatures in English literature! It hardly qualifies as a novel. There is no character development and no real conflict. There is a great deal of spinning of wheels, literally and figurately, as Darcy goes jaunting about the countryside picking up various bodies dead and alive (many of which we never meet again), and lots and lots of repetition. If you feel you must read it, I would suggest reading the first chapter and then skipping to about page 200. You won't miss anything.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|It's lightweight but construction is solid. One nice thing to call out is that the inside front cover is fabric so it provides a thin layer of padding and a non-scratch surface. I don't really notice it when I'm reading which is how it should be- secondary to the product it's made for covering.  The folding kickstand function is nice but more importantly it does its job and protects my Kindle Fire.  Recommended.
0345505387|1.0|While it is apparent that the artist has talent, each of the character all looked far too much alike with the exception of their clothes and hair color.  I had really pictured the characters to look a lot more like the characters in Rob Roy and Braveheart. Whereas, this particular book showed a look something more like an anime style of artistic license being given to it. I also much preferred the style of writing that had been given to the former Outlander series in which the lead character was written in first person, while all of the others were all in third person.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|When I first heard that Jim Carrey did The Christmas Carol, I chose to avoid it for a very long time.  I remembered seeing his version of The Grinch and was so turned off by it, I kind of swore off Jim Carrey movies for a while.  This Christmas season though, I thought I'd give it a chance.  So, I rented it and was amazed.  The graphics were exceptional.  Everything was immensely beautiful.  Even more than that though, the thing I was the most pleased with was how they chose to stay faithful to the original story by Dickens.  They chose to respect his work, so I am so much the more inclined to respect them for it.  Good job all around.  The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five was for the few times they chose to abandon Dickens' story line.  There was one scene in particular where Scrooge asks the ghost of Christmas present why he chose to have all of the stores in town close down one day a week.  I assume he is referring to the Sabbath.  The ghost of Christmas present then rebukes organized religion by telling Scrooge to not blame him for the mistakes made by \\"so called men of the cloth who claim to know me.\\"  Sorry, but I really don't like seeing religion get trashed.  Aside from that though. it was wonderful.  I plan to buy it.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Fawlty Towers remains one of my most cherished shows from Great Britian and for good reason.  There's never really been anything else quite like it on the tube, in either the UK or US.  John Cleese's adept comic skills and physical slapstick really take the show to the next level.  A wonderful supporting cast of characters (and actors) make the entire thing one uproarious set to own.  Even at its slowest it is still somewhat closer to 'manic' than 'metered' and is all the better for it.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|There's not much I can say about Adele's \\"21\\" that hasn't already been said.  It is full of great music and refreshing intelligent lyrics.  In fact for the first time in a long time the lyrics are what make this album of songs great. You won't find any mind numbing senseless lyrics such as \\"my humps\\" but soulful reflective anecdotal  words straight from the heart of the writer, Adele.  Her songs have a broad reach. Both teenagers and more mature folk will find something to relate to on this album.  Some of the songs fit into the entertainment category but even those songs have thought provoking lyrics.  It makes me sad to read reviews and blogs where people are criticizing and even making fun of Adele's weight.  If she were a svelte perfectly beautiful young woman with a shallow well of emotion and few painful experiences to draw upon I doubt this album would have ever been made.  Sadly, as it is, Adele's pain is our gain.  After more than a decade of obtuse, intelligence-insulting blather from unintelligent scam \\"artists\\" it is almost miraculous that Adele has become the success that she has. I am grateful to her for producing great music with equally great lyrics.  \\"21\\" is an incredible work of art.  I highly recommend this album of songs.
B00000G3I2|5.0|Quite often, I come to read Amazon reviews & someone has already written what's in my mind about the subject at hand, and therefore, I feel no need to leave my remarks. I expected that to be the case with this film, given it's age, the overall impact it's had on society, and also the frequency with which it's shown on cable TV to this day. I was surprised to find out, after reading said reviews, that no one had articulated my thoughts, or seemed to quite capture in words what I've gleened from multiple watchings of this movie over the years. I came here to say what I've gotten from the film over the years, and hope to inspire someone who has never seen this great piece of art to watch it- no matter what their age might be. The music is perfectly chosen, the story easy to get into & follow, the scenes are logical & realistic. A top-notch cast & thoughtful dialogue makes this movie continue to stand out as the years pass by, and owning this DVD was a foregone conclusion to me. In my opinion, the scenes which were cut- including the ones with Kevin Costner- were omitted for good reason. They ultimately serve no purpose to the plot, don't add any needed detail to the movie, and in fact would've taken away from the great pace of the film. So kudos to the editing team here, for actually dismissing scenes that should've been removed- which is NOT something that can be said of many a movie!<br /><br />I first saw this film as a teenager, and I loved it instantly. I could relate even then to the sense that it's amongst one's chosen friends & not usually the family one is born into that you feel most at home. I could understand even then, if not entirely comprehend, the characters' general sense of unease about their modern lives. I, perhaps a tad sadly, can now grasp their nostalgia fully about the liberal & idealistic past they shared, contrasted against their now-materialistic present. I could see how easy it is to lose oneself, and slowly watch relationships we once held so dear evaporate, in the mire of the after-college-is-over swampland. But, don't be deceived, this isn't just a shallow movie about selfish people having beautiful material things, though most of the characters are well-off. And as one of them says so succintly, \\"No one ever had a cushier berth than us...\\" Maybe that aspect puts off some viewers, to see the characters living in relative wealth & yet still able to find things to complain or feel empty about in their lives. But the universal truth that money doesn't buy happiness (or security, or lasting love, or real friendship) is nowhere more touchingly shown than in this film, in my opinion. Repeated viewings only confirm this for me as I've aged myself, gotten a bigger salary & had many beautiful material possessions come into my own life. This isn't a film to be watched only with the eyes of envy, cynicism or negativity. One must still have an open mind & a little bit of an open heart. Each time I see it again I get some new life lesson out of it or relate to something fresh that I didn't pick up on before. There's not many films I can honestly say that about.<br /><br />The synopsis of the film has been well-discussed by other reviewers in terms of plot, so I will not re-hash that. What I'd prefer to focus on are the characters, who are the real reason why one should seek out this film. This could have easily become a trivial plot-driven film, in the hands of a less capable cast & crew. However, it remains doggedly character-driven, so much so that you're left feeling (in under two hours) like you've known these people your entire life. There is a warmth, realism, flawed beauty & timelessness that this movie continues to convey to me.<br /><br />Sarah, played by Glenn Close, is an embodiment of the woman many of us females long to be- a good mother, well-to-do financially, successful and competent in her work as a doctor, happily married to a wonderful man named Harold (played by Kevin Kline), possesses seemingly endless energy. Sarah plays the role of \\"the good girl\\" as she was born and bred to do, though occasionally frustrated with the demands of society to play that part, yet maintains an almost-complete alignment with the life she's chosen. JoBeth Williams portrays Karen, a deeply-dissatisfied homemaker, wife and mother who seems to have it all on the outside. Her marriage to Richard (played by a former \\"Ironside\\" co-star, Don Galloway), which was entered into due to a host of deep insecurities on her part, is woefully inadequate to her. She is somewhat spoiled, very attractive, has a serious seductive streak and is a bit self-centered. Nonetheless, she is no sociopath- just an unhappy person who never really found her own voice in life, despite having what appears to be an ideal existence. The role of Chloe (Meg Tilly) has been called a ditzy girl by many a reviewer- and on the surface, perhaps that's accurate enough. However, I think she is simply not a woman who is one to wear her heart on her sleeve, as her few remarks and thoughtful glances along the way actually show a depth and maturity unheard of in a truly dumb person. Simply because she is young, that doesn't mean her character is a throwaway, though repeated viewings are what showed me these subtleties. My personal favorite of all the cast (male or female) is Mary Kay Place's Meg, an atheist who believes that she wants to be a mother more than anything else in life, but is completely exhausted by swimming in the limited dating pool available to her. Her humor and pragmatism is most enjoyable to me. Place portrays her character with a sense of real-world weariness which can only found by those who have been a single working woman putting up with nonsense, for more time than anyone should have to.<br /><br />Harold, the kind and handsome Everyman of the film, is the archetypal \\"good guy\\", played to absolute perfection by Kline. He embodies strength, fortitude, stability and graciousness. Out of all the characters here, it is he who grieves the most for his deceased friend, Alex. Nick (William Hurt) is Karen's ex-boyfriend, perpetually hiding from planting any real roots in the world, a man who seems to feel everything too deeply- and thus, as a defense mechanism, reverts to pretending he feels nothing at all. He is somewhat mired in the world of drugs, temporary self-satisfaction, and a restlessness that his fellow Big Chillers seem to have long ago shrugged off. I found Nick to be the most relatable of all the males within the group. Perhaps this is because he's the one person unwilling to make excuses for his own personal BS, as the others are apt to do. Michael is the \\"opportunist\\" of the group, the one that is notoriously known as unlikable to many audiences, played to the hilt by the intelligent Jeff Goldblum. His bracingly-cold rationalizations about his big-city motivations and ambitions, while screaming that he's of the \\"Me Decade\\" in spades, are actually quite refreshing. Besides Nick, he is perhaps the most unflinchingly accepting of who he really is, without putting on a sweet veneer for the benefit of others. Rounding out the cast is a slim, mustached Tom Berenger, and here he's playing a ruggedly-handsome actor named Sam who's made it big in Hollywood. Divorced, with a young daughter that he rarely sees, he is as attracted to Nick's old flame Karen as she is to him (which would be A LOT). He wonders if he is doing anything of real meaning with his life, despite the success, glory and fame that's come to him. Sam also questions his own depth often, a thought that seems to reverberate with each character, almost as if the ghost of Alex himself is whispering the same question in each of their ears: \\"What, of any worth, have you REALLY done in your life? I think that perhaps you've accomplished absolutely nothing...So don't kid yourself about how great you are.\\"<br /><br />In the end, there are no real answers to anyone's questions- the group's simply relegated to enjoying each other with the time that they have left on earth. As in real life, no one can find out a certain answer as to why we're here, or if what we're really doing matters that much. And the conclusion you come to is that all one can do is be the best version of yourself that you can, leave the rest to fate, and hope that it all works out in the end. This is a film to enjoy for the pure pleasure of seeing really great actors, and ones that excel as team players in a film which requires just that, performing a story which holds a mirror up to each of us in it's own way. Don't look to find out the meaning of existence in it's dialogue or plot line. In keeping that realistic expectation, I think you'll find this movie alternately cathartic, funny and moving.acters here, it is he who grieves the most for his deceased friend, Alex. Nick (William Hurt) is Karen's ex-boyfriend, perpetually hiding from planting any real roots in the world, a man who seems to feel everything too deeply- and thus, as a defense mechanism, reverts to pretending he feels nothing at all. He is somewhat mired in the world of drugs, temporary self-satisfaction, and a restlessness that his fellow Big Chillers seem to have long ago shrugged off. I found Nick to be the most relatable of all the males within the group. Perhaps this is because he's the one person unwilling to make excuses for his own personal BS, as the others are apt to do. Michael is the \\"opportunist\\" of the group, the one that is notoriously known as unlikable to many audiences, played to the hilt by the intelligent Jeff Goldblum. His bracingly-cold rationalizations about his big-city motivations and ambitions, while screaming that he's of the \\"Me Decade\\" in spades, are actually quite refreshing. Besides Nick, he is perhaps the most unflinchingly accepting of who he really is, without putting on a sweet veneer for the benefit of others.

B003Y5H5AG|3.0|As a child of the 80s, I was a big fan of the Smurfs and was excited when I heard they were making a movie. And as the movie stands on its own, it's an okay kids movie. The cast is great and the animated smurfs are cute. But it didn't reinvigorate the same magic that the cartoon held. A few things bugged me, like the fact that they planted the smurfs into current-day NYC, the voices of the smurfs were not as easy to distinguish as in the cartoon, and while I love the cast, I didn't feel as though Neil Patrick Harris really connected with his little blue co-stars, although he did a fine job. Azrael the cat too is played by a real cat, with a few animations added and just ended up looking silly. I would have rather seen a movie completely in 3D animation, no live actors, and set in the smurf village and forest. All in all, an okay movie but not for the smurfy at heart.
0316056863|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book!  It is both hilarious and enlightening at the same time.  I watch and follow both 30 Rock and SNL which made the book even easier to read.  In addition, the insights that Tina Fey shares are also great eye-openers.  It is a perfect light read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a great time killer.  If you don't have the time to crack into something huge like an rpg, then I recommend you try this.

0307949486|3.0|The problem with being the last person on the planet to read an \\"amazing\\" book is that it can't possibly live up to the hype, and I think that's the problem for me with this one.<br /><br />Yes, I loved Lisbeth; yes, I'd like to have a fling with Mikhail; yes, I enjoyed watching them unravel the mystery. But in the end I didn't think it was that deep of a mystery, and I thought the book went on way too long after it was solved. The Wennerstrom story was interesting, but once the \\"Harriet situation\\" was resolved I didn't care much about it. (Please note: Yes, I understood it; I just didn't care ... )<br /><br />This had been on my list of \\"books I will never read\\" because I don't read books in series. The reason it came off that list is the movie. I always see all of the Best-Pic nominees before the Oscars, and I'm pretty sure this will be one of them. I wanted to read the book first so I'd be grounded in the plot. However, I'm hoping the movie of the next book in the trilogy is a bomb, because I really don't want to read that one.
B003KUSUG8|2.0|I used to like Eminem, but after hearing this im not a fan of him. It was June 18th,2010, i just took my science final so i had a half day of school. I was watching the fuse eminem takeover and i saw the video for not afraid, it was cool so i went to fye and bought the cd. I thought it would be great but was i wrong!!!!<br /><br />1. \\"Cold Wind Blows\\"  - okay opening, kindda funny (4 out of 5)<br /><br />2. \\"Talkin' 2 Myself\\" (featuring Kobe)- okay track, not a fan of kobe or the lyrics. (3 out of 5)<br /><br />3. \\"On Fire\\"- one of the good songs (4 Out of 5)<br /><br />4. \\"Won't Back Down\\" (featuring Pink) - not a fan of this song, i hated pink's part! (2 out of 5)<br /><br />5. \\"W.T.P.\\"- okay song, i liked it (3 out of 5)<br /><br />6. \\"Going Through Changes\\"- another song about his daughter. (2 out of 5)<br /><br />7. \\"Not Afraid\\"- i used to like it but it gets annoying hearing it all over the radio and s*** (3 out of 5)<br /><br />8. \\"Seduction\\"- hated it (1 out of 5)<br /><br />9. \\"No Love\\" (featuring Lil Wayne)- this song is getting a one from me because wayne is in it (1.5 out of 5)<br /><br />10. \\"Space Bound\\"- stupid song, i hate the music video and chorus (1.5 out of 5)<br /><br />11. \\"Cinderella Man\\"- Great song. (5 out of 5)<br /><br />12. \\"25 to Life\\"- kind of boring song (1 out of 5)<br /><br />13. \\"So Bad\\"- only song produced by dre, so it has to be great (4.5 out of 5)<br /><br />14. \\"Almost Famous\\"- okay song, not the best (2 out of 5)<br /><br />15. \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" (featuring Rihanna)- my god i hate this song so freakin much, rhianna sucks, the beat sucks and the lyrics suck, worst song on the album (1 out of 5)<br /><br />16. \\"You're Never Over\\" - R.I.P Proof(4 out of 5)<br /><br />17. \\"Untitled\\" (hidden track)- good song (3 out of 5)<br /><br />so in my opinion i didnt like this album, i thought em sould out but after hearing hell the sequal i still have hope

B004MC8CA2|3.0|Though this may seem like your typical fantasy adventure, there are a myriad of vicious maulings, explicit torture scenes, rape and prostitution, so a warning ahead of time would have been nice! Also it's over 1000 pages long! I mean, really?

If the author could have just taken one of those and ran with it it would have been fantastic.  The book had so much more potential. I would recommend loaning it from the library if you really want to read it!

B004ECDNJU|4.0|Not bad, but I agree that it could be improved after playing a few levels.  First, a speed up option during actual game play would be nice.  Also I don't see point of lives AND a timer.  Keep just one or make different modes.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|This was a great dvd! To see her that excited truly showed who she was and that her dream came through. Not only talented and young but she is funny as well. I have watched this and listen to it several times now
B004EBZX6W|5.0|There are always many WIFI signals around me so this helped me to choose the absolute best connection with best internet speeds. Time is money and very costly so you can't sit around waiting for your device to connect to the internet. There's also a variety of graphs to help you visualize.  I hope this helps you make an important decision!
B0064T6LV8|1.0|I got this game about 3days ago and it is still loding !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have no idea what is going on so I cant get it on my k-fire :(
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game is truly awesome. It is just like normal Fruit Ninja but for Puss in Boots and Shrek fans. It features commentary for Puss, himself and instead of Classic, Zen and Arcade modes it has Desperado (A combination of Classic and Arcade) and Bandito which is my favorite. It features three Acts (each with four levels) and a finale Act. This app also has many different blades- Original, Cat Claw, Iron Shackle, A Deck of Cards (Royal Flush), A Golden Blade and many more. It also has four different backgrounds- San Ricardo, The Cat Cantina, Giant's Castle, and Treasure Room. Overall this is a great app and can kill time easily.  I hope this helps you make an important decision!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I dare you to put this book down easily. I was barely able to. The book is written in the first person perspective of Katniss, and you feel you're right beside her the whole time. Watching helplessly, rooting her on, feeling her emotions. This book was incredibly well-written! You're really able to \\"feel\\" the characters and care about them. You will not regret reading this, trust me!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|exceptional game. I really like the randomness it has. games are simplistic not too hard to figure out. I would recommend this gameto anyone that is trying to past the time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game to occupy you. Definitely a mind teaser also. recommended for all ages who have a new kindle fire.
B00020HCH2|5.0|In the poetic lyricism of the First Symphony's andante (2nd movement) and in the crescendos of the finale (4th movement) one can immediately hear the superiority of the New York Philharmonic over Walter's so-called Columbia Symphony Orchestra in his later, stereo \\"Indian Summer\\" recordings of the Brahms cycle (both on Sony). This earlier, mono version (1951-1953)with the NYP may not have the superior engineering of those last recordings made in Los Angeles, but it is in every way superior. The interpretation is so much more passionate and lyrical and the playing of the New York Philharmonic is abolutely gorgeous. While some listeners may still prefer the \\"mellowness\\" of the later stereo version, to my ears it sounds tired and sluggish compared to this much rarer, earlier recording -- finally made available by Sony Classics. Excellently re-mastered with all four symphonies on only 2 CDs (with the only really outstanding Walter-conducted Brahms 4th on CD), this is a clear first choice. It demonstrates, unlike the stereo remake, why Bruno Walter was one of the great Brahmsians of the 20th-century.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I love listening to this CD while I am either just sitting and absorbing the various sound effects or reading or cleaning. Having seen the movie earlier this year I just knew I had to get the CD. It's the kind of music I can listen to over and over. Also, the ship time was excellent.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|It's worth the money. My son wouldn't take any of the other pacifiers especially the ones made of silicon. It's adorable and he started grabbing for the toy by 3 months old! love it.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|It passes the time alright, but there could be better games ln here. I fond myself gushing through most of them hoping to unlock a better one next.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this solitaire a lot. plays just as well as the iphone version.  have not experienced any problems with the app at all.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is completely ridiculous.  I love it!  I got my spouse hooked and told friends about it.  It's fun and addictive.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|I have an Asus Transformer and it works just fine on the lastest version of Honeycomb. I love that I am able to change the speed of the &quot;orbs&quot; of fire. It is great for those of us who like puzzles and fast thinking games. Just as well, it's perfect for others who want to take there time at doing a puzzle. The levels of course start off simple and once you get used to the speed, it's easy to get the hang of the game. I can sense me playing this app more often than the many others I have on my tablet because it is just that great to pass time without being mindless.
0439023521|5.0|Quick read, page turner, everything I ever wanted out of a book. A twisted plot that's not usually my style but it was so good I couldn't stop reading. Defiantly a must read.
B005MIYI3K|5.0|This is by far my favorite Nightwish album to date. Nightwish has always been a great band with their own distinct sound. Prior to Dark Passion Play, I think Tarja really defined the band. When they left, the remaining band members really upped their game and took a big leap hiring Anette as their replacement, and I felt that Anette sounded nervous and untrained for this style of music.   All that being said, Imaginaerum is incredible. Nightwish has truly found their sound again. Anette and Marco compliment each other amazingly well, and each track is just as awesome as the previous. With prior Nightwish albums, there were usually a few hits and the rest were worth skipping. This one, I listen through the entire record every time.   5 stars, easily.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I like the valentines scene it is so pretty and fun truss wat my daddy didn't know wat angry birds were now he is addicted. just like me

B003X5UFWW|5.0|This movie is definitely five stars for acting, fight scenes, music and story. Starts slowly and then becomes much more than what it initially appears to be. I would watch it again.
B005HSL626|5.0|The idea of slicing fruit is so simple, but yet the game makes it super fun AND addicting! :)<br />Works great on android and kindle fire.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|These days, a lot of our movies have villains being anti-heroes, government conspiracy, greedy corporations, etc.  As intriguing and interesting, as those are, they can really take a toll on you after a while.  Not only wearing those plot lines thin, it can kinda darken your view of life.  So, this film was actually a huge breath of fresh air (\\"The King's Speech\\" was another brilliant one).  To see pure conviction and sincere heroics.  See good men and women do good things not for pay, but for resolute compassion is very uplifting and inspiring.  It may be \\"another superhero movie\\", but there's a depth to it I did not expect when seeing it on the big screen the first time.  Living in a world where many of us resigned ourselves to just surviving day to do, it was a good encouragement being reminded that there are people \\"who just don't like bullies\\"...where the little guy did not give up on his dream and purpose - even when stopped at every corner.  It's a good film and got it as soon as I could on DVD.  A very rare pure diamond in an entertainment society dominated by intrigue and controversy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is FANTASTIC! this app is simple and aesthetically pleasing. I have won more times than I havelost and the touch screen has worked great
B004LWZW9C|5.0|To me, this movie is a sequel to Valentine's Day, even though some actors from the first play different characters. This movie is a great romantic love story and just as good as Valentine's Day. It's the perfect movie to end the old year and begin the new. This movie has Halle Berry who plays a nurse named Aimee trying to help a cancer patient on his last day of life. Jessica Biel plays a pregnant woman named Tess trying to have the 1st baby at midnight. Jon Bon Jovi plays a singer named Jensen that tries to win back the love of his life. Abigail Breslin plays Hailey who wants to spend the evening with her boyfriend in Times Square Robert DeNiro's character, Stan is the saddest and wants to see the ball drop one last time. Josh Duhamel plays Sam, a man hoping to meet up with a woman he met on New Year's Eve the year before. Ashton Kutcher plays Randy, a heart-broken man that gets stuck on the elevator with a woman named Elise and begin to fall in love. Hillary Swank plays Claire, Vice-President of the Times Square Alliance that tries to get the ball to drop before midnight. Finally, we have Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Ingrid. Ingrid was my favorite character in the whole movie. She asks Zac Efron's character, Paul to help her complete her New Years resolutions by midnight. (I honestly think the Ingrid/Paul storyline could have been a great movie by itself) I hope everyone had a great year, and can't wait to see what 2012 brings. I would highly recommend NEW YEAR'S EVE!!!

B00000J048|5.0|My 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she loves it - as do her parents.  We didn't find the pieces difficult to assemble.  It's true that it's challenging for a 4 year old, but it's a toy that my child can grow with, and that she can continue to explore and find new ways to understand for many years to come.  It looks durable, but we've only had it a little over a week.  For the 4-5 year old age group, parents can expect to render a little assistance, but they'll probably think it's fun, too.  Here's another unexpected plus: it's made in Italy.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|720p, and I cannot detect \\"draw-in\\" on the monitor with the game RAGE.  Good quality monitor, and the sound is really good and bass heavy outta the box.  $299 for a monitor and sound this good is a little steep to me, though the price has nowhere to go but down in the future.    $250 seems more fair to me as a price, if a 17\\" model was available that would leave me more comfortable paying $300.
B000B5MI3Q|3.0|Prospective buyers should beware that when purchased from Mr. Watch this watch is a gray market watch and will not include a box, manual, manufacturer's warranty, or any proof of authenticity.  I have done my best to verify that what I received was genuine and everything seems correct, but the watch itself came in a plastic bag shoved in a non-branded box and a \\"warranty\\" certificate from Mr. Watch, not Seiko.  Given the frequency of fakes these days buyers who care about making sure their product is genuine probably want to look elsewhere.
0307946711|1.0|This is the first review I have ever written on a book.  I hated this book so much that I felt I had to write this.  The book takes forever to develop a story, absolutely nothing meaningful takes place until the book is almost over, and then in one line, everything you have been waiting for comes crashing down as an important character in the story dies.  I finished this book and was so disappointed.  How could so many people have reviewed it positively?  Please, don't waste your time or money on this meaningless and downright stupid book.  There are so many better choices...
B005K17RU0|4.0|very easy to use, very accurate.  radar works great and graphics are very easy to understand.  I recommend. this app.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I used to be one of those people who go from one book series to the next the way most people flip through movie channels... until I read Matin`s A Game of Thrones series. Now every other book or series pales in comparison; characters are pathetically two dimensional, plots are dull and predictable, and (worst of all) everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />If you want drama, historical fantasy, love, hate, and a world that will draw you in, these books are for you. However, if you want good vs evil, good wins, fairy tale, blah, blah, blah... you will want to pass this by. Like I said, the worst thing about it is that it will ruin all other epic fantasy books for you. Trust me, it`s worth it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Product arrvied as described.  My family members watched it.  I could not.  Its pretty disturbing.  Good luck sleeping or going anywhere in teh dark after watching.
B003629IPW|5.0|I got a chance to watch part of this on HBO and found his stage presence sparking an interest to re-visit his music. Michael Jackson was such a great dancer, singer, and showman. I found the dvd on amazon on sale very cheap on black friday and decided to add it to my order. To me, the dvd with the bonus features is a fascinating look into how he worked, as well as an enjoyable way to listen to his music. It's a shame he had problems and died young because This Is It looks like it would have been an incredible show to see.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love being able to choose from a random deal or a winning deal. Auto complete after uncovering all the cards is another plus. Being able to choose between scoring styles is also nice.
B006RED4GA|2.0|For a $10 rental I was expecting allot more out of this movie. It just dragged and dragged. The plot was almost non-existent and Sarah Paxton's performance reminded me a bit too much of Kristen Stewart and her unsubtle awkwardness.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|There's really nothing to be said about this book that hasn't been said a million times over.  Either you're in the mood for a heartwarming classic Christmas tale by a master of English literature or you aren't.  The story may be familiar, but Christmas is a great time for familiar tales.  Dickens brings a wit and quality of observation to the book that many of the abridged versions and movie adaptations lack.<br /><br />Regarding the Kindle version:  several reviews are faulting the free version for lacking an interactive table of contents, less than perfect formatting (lack of white space or chapter headings), or illustrations.  These are common to all public domain free books - it's odd to fault this particular book for them.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This is a very easy to use and intuitive tool.  It does every thing you need a basic drawing and annotation tool to do. Adding and editing text, shapes, and other objects is a breeze. Moving and resizing objects is also very easy especially when compared to other tablet tools. The integration with Evernote is a nice plus.

B0001I562I|5.0|This movie takes me 20 yrs back in time, when I would spend the weekends gazing at the sky expecting the navigator to land and pick me, so that I can ride through the universe.  Crap I am no more a kid, cant believe in these lovely fantasies that I grew up with, atleast they will remain a fantasy for me forever :). Lovely.
0307279189|3.0|If you believe in God, McDougall will try to crush your faith in chapter 28 when he starts asserting that our bodies evolved to be able to run, speaking of the theory of  evolution as though it were a undisputed fact, as unwaveringly as if he were there and seen it happen. I believe God designed our bodies so we could run, and I get sad when someone tries to take the credit away from my God and say our magnificent bodies our feet and legs, our hands, our eyes, our brain, our ability to feel love, all that we are just made itself. If you are one of the many people who choose to believe in evolution you will love the book. If you are like me and many others who believe in creation you may still like just skip chapter 28
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Its quite spacious, comfortable to wear, but the inner walls are not so stable, that the camera keeps sagging down, and I dont remove the lens, so I guess the weight pulls it down real low.

B0059XTUVI|5.0|Some reviewers have panned \\"The Iron Lady,\\" directed by Phyllida Lloyd from a screenplay by Abi Morgan.  They resent the filmmakers' portrayal of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, one of the most controversial political figures of the twentieth century, as an elderly woman in decline.  Lloyd shows Thatcher having hallucinations, during which she converses with her departed husband, Denis.  She is forgetful, distracted, and lives more in the past than in the present.  Other critics have suggested that \\"The Iron Lady\\" gives short shrift to Thatcher's political career, placing too much emphasis on her personality and her relationship with family and colleagues.<br /><br />It is unfair to condemn the movie that Lloyd and Morgan should have made.  \\"The Iron Lady\\" is not meant to be a conventional biopic that focuses solely on how Thatcher's conservative policies affected Great Britain between 1979 and 1990.  Lloyd and Morgan have a different purpose in mind--to examine what drove Margaret Roberts to embark on a political career; the difficulties she faced juggling marriage, parenthood, and her busy work schedule; and the price that she (and some might say her country) paid for her stubborn adherence to what she considered to be non-negotiable principles. We observe Thatcher's life through the prism of her memories, as she recalls events from her girlhood, courtship with Denis, and turbulent years in office.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is exceptional as Margaret Thatcher.  Her facial expressions, carriage, and voice perfectly convey Thatcher's ambition, single-mindedness, and determination.  Streep also reveals her subject's flaws:  Thatcher could be petty, unfeeling, and domineering.  The most poignant and memorable scenes depict Mrs. Thatcher more than two decades after she retired as frightened, confused, lonely, and preoccupied with bygone events.  Jim Broadbent is superb as Denis, who applauded his wife's triumphs but resented her bossiness and obstinacy. There are wonderfully humorous moments and some scenes that may reduce the audience to tears.  The movie is not perfect.  At times the script and the score are heavy-handed and manipulative. However, most viewers will understand if not empathize with the grocer's daughter who attended Oxford and went on to govern Great Britain for over a decade.  Right or wrong, she was destined to make history.nts and some scenes that may reduce the audience to tears.  The movie is not perfect.

B001OQCV6K|1.0|This is not a review for the movie, it is for the product that Amazon is selling.  The Blu-Ray comes with a code for a digital copy which expired in March 2011.  First off, this is ludicrous that the studios put expiration dates on the digital copies.  This only encourages the use of third-party software to rip the DVD so that one can put it on a portable player.  Second, Amazon should disclose that it is selling products with expired codes.
B0036T32LQ|4.0|The film has some fairly good acting and effects one of the best Bermuda Triangle fictions I have seen: had to keep reminding myself Bermuda Triangel thus, Triangle. Very creepy scenes and a few cool allusions and just when you think you can predict the movie moves forward, backward, no no linear. As the record skips... Over all I liked this movie.

0307959856|1.0|The only reason I'm still reading this is that my mom gave it to me for Christmas. And I don't want to disappoint her. But this book is awful. For a whodunit, I honestly don't care who did it at this point. If PD James is trying to write long sentences like Austen, instead of flowing they're just ponderous. There's too much modernity in the book, which I guess should be expected from a modern author. But she definitely didn't channel the voice of Austen, whose books still resonate today despite the century in which they were written. In the forward, PD James notes that Jane Austen would have written a better book. Truer words were never spoken
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a really good game, you gave 117 games to choose from its one of the best i have ever played its great because if you don't want to use ALOT of space, you don't have too because MOST of the games you want to play is right here in &quot;101Games+16!!!!!!!!(:

B0006HBZXS|1.0|Just an appallingly awful movie.  Its ONLY saving grace is that it does venture into the realm of the unintentionally hilarious---and I really do mean laugh out loud dumb.  In the words of one of our unfortunate actors \\"run its a man eater\\"!!!!
B005UKJX4E|2.0|A full-screen title card near the head of The Tree of Life DVD exhorts something like \\"For optimal experience, play at maximum volume.\\" Excuse me? This director is such a control freak that he wants to manipulate my home video experience with sensitivity for neither the nearness of the neighbors nor my audio system's potential to inflict physical pain?<br /><br />Get real, you barmy old dude. It is out of your hands now.<br /><br />A more sympathetic observer ventured that Malick worries about us missing a single syllable of the airy voice over. In that case, he needed to speak with his sound editor much earlier, not me, and especially needed to rattle the cages of the studio apes who routinely ignore all meter level readings during the transfer to digital video. [Incidentally, the transfer techs' negligence is even more appalling when they mix down a streaming version.]<br /><br />This inability to let go reveals a justifiable insecurity that his audience might just as soon give the excess grandiosity of rumbling molten lava and similar auditory bombast a miss. That ill-advised level-setting directive tipped me resolutely away from being agnostic about Malick's genius (one gets why some admire him so intensely) into derision for his megalomania. Raging against God is not proof of a profound spirituality, but rather of a narcissistic religiosity, its paradoxical opposite.<br /><br />Yes, everyone agrees the cinematography is lovely, but that audio control trip tainted even my inclination to indulge the DP when he drifts into fey or overly contrived imagery a tad too often, overreaching the picture's distinct visual tone with notes ringing false and/or falling flat. One loathes such maladroit attempts to manipulate the emotions. In good movies, it's a seamless pleasure to surrender to the flow. When that becomes forced & overwrought, I resist & resent.<br /><br />A last note: People talk about Malick as a uniquely American giant of the cinema. Clearly these folks have never been exposed to the metaphysical meditations of Andrei Tarkovsky, easily the greatest Russian filmmaker since Eisenstein (or ever), and from whom the entire last sequence of Tree of Life is lifted virtually intact. Tastemakers can be so under-informed, it would be risible were sheep not so ready to repeat whatever the herd is bleating. / 30xii11 /ations of Andrei Tarkovsky, easily the greatest Russian filmmaker since Eisenstein (or ever), and from whom the entire last sequence of Tree of Life is lifted virtually intact.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I know, I know, the premise SHOULD scare away any decent person, but, my, how \\"Breaking Bad\\" gets your ATTENTION!  A work of near genious.
B005PK58TI|5.0|From \\"Your going to die in there\\" to \\"What am I going to do with you!\\" this was so engrossing I was addicted from the start. One problem though, three episodes (Home Invasion, Murder House, Halloween part 1) aired before the pilot so it went from the pilot to episode 4 (Halloween part 2).  Thanks to Comcast \\"catch up\\" I was able to see the three episodes that were skipped during the regular season, After that, the story line, characters and music, all fit like a black latex glove.  If this was just one season the story would be complete (unlike Lost).  Great job to all who put this story together. Can't image that any thing to follow will top the first season but will be watching.  Why was the three episode skip??

B005WLQQ4Q|1.0|Cute actors playing the role of hip-hop stars. Do they write their own songs? Arrange them? Play an instrument on them? Sing without the use of autotune? Is the music worth hearing? Is it even remotely good? The answer to all these questions is NO. Anyone over the age of 15 should be ashamed to admit they enjoy this so-called music.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a good game. it is very addicting and will last you a while. it is a great free game that is worth a try.

B005C7SXMS|3.0|SUBMARINE is a very quirky, deeply INDIE-feeling movie.  It's set in lower class England, and involves a \\"coming of age\\" story for the very quirky, very INDIE-feeling Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts).  He's a bit of a loner...his only friends being boys who torment him only a little less than the rest of the school population.  But he's managed to catch the eye of the quirky, very INDIE-feeling Jordana (Yesmin Paige), and attempts to chart his way through his first experience with young love.  This is the kind of film where the main character provides significant narration.  He's also one of those kids prone to blank looks, the \\"affectless\\" attitude so often seen in modern films about troubled teens.  The movie is slow paced, the accents thick and the humor of the most subtle kind.  It's not really a comedy, but more of a quirky drama.    You may gather from my repeated use of the words \\"quirky\\" and \\"indie\\" that I find the film to be predictable and tired.  And much of it is.  The mood, the camera angles, the narration, so much feels SO terribly familiar.  What was once (what, maybe 20 years ago?) a fresh approach to storytelling now feels as clichéd as the any Hollywood film...just on a lower budget.  I found the first half of the movie to be almost unbearably familiar.  But something happened along the way that pulls this film out of the trash heap.  It actually deals with some real emotions.  Most importantly, we come to understand that although Oliver's parents are quirky...the fact that their relationship is crumbling is actually a cause of some very real anxiety for Oliver.  He WANTS his parents to stay together.  He loves them and can tell they love him...but he also wants his family unit for the security and stability they bring him.  He's as surprised to discover it as we are.  His dad (Noah Taylor, who turns out to be quite amusing and endearing by the end) is a biologist who barely makes a living, and seems incapable of bringing any excitement to his wife.  Mom (Sally Hawkins) is coasting on the edge of leaving her family when who should move in across the street but her extremely quirky former boyfriend (Paddy Considine in a terrific mullet!) and his wife.  The old boyfriend is a low-rent psychic, giving lectures and selling VHS tapes of those lectures, complete with terrible special effects.  Mom is drawn to him, because he is alive and full of energy, even if he's also full of BS.  Oliver senses danger, and in his own quirky way, tries to restore order to the family.  In the meantime, Jordana begins to let her guard down with Oliver, and the two grow close despite her stated desire to remain aloof.  It's a subtle change, and I also liked that the question of Oliver losing his virginity is handled in a humorous and relatively dignified manner.  And when Jordana has an emotional crisis of her own, the testing of their relationship actually contains some surprises.  SUBMARINE is still hopelessly enthralled with the trappings of indie filmmaking.  But beneath that predictable veneer, some fine ideas and good performances are there for your enjoyment.  I can't give this film a strong thumbs-up...but for a patient filmgoer, there are more worthwhile moments that I would have expected.

B006C67NP6|5.0|I played a casual gig for the first time in many *many* years on New Year's Eve (just for fun). Needless to say, I was expecting to be very rusty, and would not have remembered all of the chord changes, etc. to all of the jazz standards that I used to play regularly as a kid. I was also expecting my on-the-fly transposition skills to be rusty, which *could* have been an issue since I am a horn player and since we were playing with a vocalist who wouldn't necessarily have wanted to play those tunes in their original keys (basically rendering my fake books useless for the evening).  This app is great. For the Gen-X'ers who started playing jazz in the 90's and maybe even had a few practice tools on their old DOS/Windows PC's, it reminds me of a touch-screen/on-the-go combination of Band-in-a-Box and Encore. I was able to easily create playlists of all of the tunes in the set list, in the keys that the vocalist had selected, and using the global transposition function to convert all of the charts from C to Bb (for tenor sax, trumpet, etc.). I didn't spend a lot of time using the built-in accompaniment function, but I expect it too will be very useful (when my device is plugged into external speakers) for practicing chord changes on-the-go.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|\\"Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol\\" is probably the best of the four \\"MI\\" installments so far starring Tom Cruise. Again he plays Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent, who finds himself in big trouble (as always). Don't expect here any logic or coherence. \\"MIGP' is a roller coaster ride with lots of gadgets and cars, plus occasional humors. Perhaps too many of them, I think, but still I found myself enjoying the ride.   Without spoiling too much about the film, \\"Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol\\" follows the story of Ethan Hunt and three agents: William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, reprising his role in\\"M:i:III\\"). They have to thwart the heinous plans of one Kurt Hendricks, but this time around without any help from the IMF.  After a rather shaky opening the film becomes interesting with set-pieces in Moscow and Dubai. The storyline itself is sometimes contrived, even impossible (by the standards of action movies), but director Brad Bird (\\"The Incredibles\\" and \\"Ratatouille\\") is a skillful storyteller, who sometimes manages to effectively subvert our expectation when delivering the action scenes.   But what is really amazing is the fact Brad Bird delivers the goods despite the deeply flawed script that often seems cliché and stale. Such ideas as the \\"brilliant scientist-turned-dangerous terrorist\\" (played by Michael Nyqvist, who was much better as the journalist in the original \\"Millennium\\" trilogy) and a deadly female assassin (beautiful but slightly wooden Léa Seydoux) would have been something unbearable in the hands of lesser talent.   Yes, Brad Bird knows they are only \\"Macguffin\\" (or \\"Rabbit's Foot\\" if you like) - a plot device for a story. Luckily he knows how to use it, keeping the pace fast, not taking the film too seriously. Enjoy it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I most certainly don't write reviews for much, not unless something really impresses me. I must have a dozen or more photo editing Apps on my iPhone so I am fairly picky about what I want one to offer me.<br /><br />I have this on my Kindle Fire and, it is truly fabulous. It offers Tons of options, tools, collage, its own gallery to choose from, a crazy amount of good stuff. You won't be disappointed, I assure you.<br />Its certainly worth $$$!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Direct through LEGO it was $120 so be careful of your purchase price.<br /><br />At that price, it is the best LEGO set I've done so far. My husband has loved VW Camper Vans since I met him 20 years ago. So although he is not a LEGO fan, the idea of working together with him on this project seemed like fun. And it was (although painfully slow...). Total build time I would suspect to be about 8-10 hours - although for us we got many more hours of bonding time as he worked diligently to understand the pieces and how they went together.<br /><br />The details are incredible. Shelves, drawers, a moving table, fold down seat, curtains, inside artwork, a sink, checkerboard floor, detailed dash, pop-up top etc. make this a super cool set when complete. All the doors open, the mirror door opens, the hatchback opens, the rear seat folds down to a bed, and the table folds up or down. I love the plaid curtains and the artwork that reads, \\"Make LEGO Sets Not War\\". The engine is visible and accessible - a neat addition.<br /><br />I have a few customer images to show some of the detail that LEGO doesn't have illustrated. This is a terrific set for an older child or adult. It will take some time and patience but it is one to keep on display.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I mean for having a lot of games thumbs up but its just not the best quality and it is stile waster both in a good and bad way.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Simple game with the standard features you would expect. No frills, but perfectly enjoyable as mindless entertainment or a diversion from that task you just aren't ready to tackle.
B004GCK6XO|4.0|I give this product four stars because of the case that this movie came in. Not an original blu-ray case, but one of the similar knock offs. The movie itself is and will always be fantastic though. If you are looking for an amazing movie to watch, I would suggest this one!
0439023521|5.0|I think I'm the last person in the world to read The Hunger Games trilogy but I'll go ahead and give you a brief summary of the book along with my review.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen lives in the nation of Panem, built on the ruins of what was once North America. Once a year, the Capitol forces each district to choose one girl and one boy to send to the Hunger Games. The twenty-four tributes fight gladiator style until only one person is left alive. When Katniss's little sister is chosen as a tribute, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place.<br /><br />This book kept me guessing from almost the very beginning. Every time I thought I knew where things were going, something else happened that I didn't expect. Katniss is a great heroine. I loved that she is stronger than the Peeta, the boy tribute from her district, in many ways and is his protector. However, there were a few times when it she seemed kind of slow on the uptake. I know it was to build suspense but I wanted to yell at her to get it together. Overall though, the suspense was authentic and I was on the edge of my seat most of the time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is the best app I have got on my kindle fire it is really fun I love this app
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the second book in The Hunger Games trilogy. This review assumes that you've read the first book, The Hunger Games, and may have spoilers for it if you haven't.<br /><br />When Katniss handed the poisonous berries to Peeta, she had no idea that she could be starting the rumblings of a rebellion among the Districts. The Capitol is angry and wants Katniss and Peeta to fix the damage they've caused. There's not much more I can say about the plot of Catching Fire without giving away the many twists and turns in this book.<br /><br />I found Catching Fire just as riveting as The Hunger Games. Several of my favorite characters are back and some great new characters are introduced. It's so hard to review this book without giving something away! I'll just say that if you loved The Hunger Games, you will love Catching Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app with many different reading plans and translations! I like how it will catch you up if you have missed some days. Also works great on my computer, phone, and kindle so I can read from anywhere and pick up where I left off.
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay is the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy. This review assumes that you have read the first two books in the trilogy, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and may have spoilers for them if you haven't.<br /><br />In Mockingjay, Katniss must decide exactly how much more she's willing to sacrifice to keep the people she loves alive and help the Districts' rebellion. Once again, the action is non-stop and kept me on the edge of my seat. There are a couple of reasons why this is a four-star review instead of five-star like I gave the first two books. One is that I had some trouble following the descriptions of the Capitol and the action that took place there. Two is that I was disappointed with the way the Peeta/Katniss/Gale love triangle ended. I felt like Collins gave Katniss a really easy way out. Other than those two points, I thought this book was a satisfying end to the trilogy.
B004U52VPS|5.0|This was the first toy my 6 year-old nephew opened up on Christmas Eve - unfortunately, we couldn't get him to stop playing with it long enough to open his other gifts! He screamed out, \\"Now I can play Angry Birds in real life!\\", tore open the box, set up a scene and immediately began shooting birds at the pigs.  LOL  This is a very rough/tough boy we're talking about here - he breaks nearly everything he touches - but so far this game is still in-tact and my sister says he plays with it every day, despite all the other toys he got. As far as \\"education\\" goes, I think it's great that a kid today can enjoy a no-battery, non-video game to this degree. Playing with his hands and with real, touchable items has to mean something in such a virtually-driven world.  The best part? Paying only about $20 and getting the BEST TOY of the year hands down for my nephew!
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good game. plays very well.  I would rate this the best solitaire game ever. :-) I love it. I would have spent $15.00 for this game.
0061438294|5.0|-insightful  -interesting  -keeps you reading  -real life examples  -takes about applying abilities into a multitude of situations  -accurate   -does not take long to get to the point
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app because it gives me a variety of games to play and I cant just stick with one thing and be done I have to do multiple things to keep me entertained . so thank you :)
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Speaker for the dead is a book with a new science fiction concept, that &#34;we&#34; have a duties to our enemies.  In other words, that we should pardon those that want to exterminate us.  Which is alright, if there are rules to the fight, but that is difficult when there is a large difference en cultures............
B0054JZC6E|5.0|overall its fun at first, but after playing for a bit it gets kinda hard to make points. and all the apps to get.more.points don't. work with the.kindle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A must have for any believer or student or curious soul. Bibles, Study Helps and reading plans...Awesome.  I use it daily and in church as well. Thank You
B000026FOA|5.0|I haven't been much of a fan of Nick Drake for long, and only recently found out about him. However, after a suggestion by a close friend, and some motivation in the form of small periods of listening via Youtube, I finally bought this album, along with Drake's last album \\"Pink Moon\\", and I can not say much more than how incredible they both are. From the first to the last track, I had been carried through wave after wave of beautiful and very peaceful music. All of the orchestral accompaniments are very well written, and with Drake's voice, provide an experience and style that have never before graced my ears. All in all, this is my favorite Nick Drake album, and i recommend it to anyone who would take the time to listen.  A few of my favorite songs are \\"Time Has Told Me\\", \\"Thoughts of Mary Jane\\", and \\"Saturday Sun\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am  always on road trips. This app is fun too do and easy to play whether I am in a plane, car, or limo!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Season 5 is one of the best seasons of Supernatural.  The storyline was well developed this season and \\"Swan Song\\" is one of the best episodes of the entire series.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|Great. Probably smoothest purchase made from Amazon. Shipping was super fast and item was perfect. Would recommend this seller. No issues what so ever.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Season six is good although not quite as good as five.  Overall Supernatural is an excellent series!  Would highly recommend.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Very nice app for Kindle Fire with great graphics and features but no current radar is a big negative.  Rather go thru website to see same info and radar.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Dragon Fire was a fun game and you had better think and react fast.  You have to guide the colored dragon fire to the same color vessel or you lose a life.  The game starts off slow and gets more and more difficult.  It is good that you can slow down the speed of the colored fire to practice a few times before the real tough stuff starts.<br /><br />The game was challenging and fun to play but it does get difficult fast.  I am not sure that I will ever finish it.  It is a real time consumer.  This will not become one of my favorite games as I like other styles but overall it is fun for a while.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|convienient and even has reminders to read and do devos. I Love carrying my bible everywhere I go! I recommend this app. even if u don't use it for ur daily readings, it is so great to have when u need a quick reference.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I bought is for my husband he really enjoyed the 3 disc movie set. The quality of the movie is remarkable, the restoration of this movie lo makes it seam if has been release for the first time.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|really love it.to make it more perfect, more stuffs should be added like maybe THE FAME MONSTER and THE FAME?
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great, easy to use version of the spider solitary game. great way to pass the time, enjoy.
B005KELQEU|1.0|This item is described as being appropriate for a Kindle or Kindle Touch.  I bought it for use with my Kindle but the item was about 1/2\\" too small.  I could get my Kindle in with a lot of stretching but could not close zipper.  Item has been returned.
B0000X61UU|4.0|This was a fantastic workout, although a little too intense for me. I'm homeschooled and use Cindy Crawford's workouts in lieu of gym class. This is an advancement over her first video, which focuses more on toning and strengthening. This one really adds cardio-which isn't bad for me-I know. But, this workout video is only supposed to take an hour-something I can manage. I work on a very tight schedule and don't have time for the two hours it has taken me to complete this workout in the week and a half that I've been trying it. I love some of the excercises in here though, especially the calf excercises-which the other video neglects. So, I will be combining my favorite moves from the two in order to have a more timely, customized workout. I love how she shows you different variations of the excercises, say you have lower back pain-she shows you a different way to do the excercise without hurting yourself. The 30 second breaks were ok for the first excercise tape, but they needed to be a little longer in this one. Overall, it was a fantastic workout, I'm just not up to that pace yet, so I'll incorporate till I get there. Thanks, Cindy for making a sincere and fun workout!
0756405890|4.0|It feels like an author's first book, which it is. As a warning, I may give away more than the blurb does:  The characters are well-written. Some are idealized, but that's the whole point of them. The narrator is the main character, and portrays people as he remembers them. Inherently, this \\"simplifies\\" some of the characters. Friends are seen in a nearly perfect light. Women have descriptions of their physical attributes more often than men. Music is important. That's the whole idea. The main character is giving details as he remembers them. What does he remember about the girl who helped him at one point? That she was gorgeous. What does he remember about his friends? That they were perfect. He's only a mostly reliable narrator, and that's awesome.   The writing is almost amazing. Almost. Each smaller story is well written and they flow together fairly well, but often they have nothing to do with the overall story. Yes, we need to see how the main character came to be, but we don't need to know about every single solitary drink in a tavern he has. Seriously, readers are intelligent enough to understand he drinks. There's got to be more than a dozen pages of nothing but \\"they sat down for a drink\\". I understand that this is partially due to the narration of the main character, etc., just like I mentioned above, but it's a little over-the-top sometimes.   Everyone talks him up like he's incredible, but in all honesty, what has the main character done? He's an incredible musician, he's a great actor, he's studious, and he's very passionate. Cool, we have a character profile. But what does he DO? Does all the time we spend in Tarbean really help us understand why he's like he is? Would the story have changed at all had he wandered to the academy and worked his way into the University that way? Sure, there have to be boring bits because it's a life story, but come on, now.   All-in-all, I liked it. It wasn't the best book I've ever read, but for a first shot, it was pretty solid. I just finished the second book in the series, and seem to be in the relative minority in that I enjoyed it a lot more than the first.
B004132I20|5.0|Just finished watching every episode as well as the first one of season 2. Was hooked from the off, didn't expect much but this blew me away!  Looking forward to seeing the next 2 episodes of season 2, as the first episode was the best one yet, blu ray pre-ordered!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for kids and long drives. the games are timed and you need to get over a score to complete it.this app hassocks many games to play but you need to unlock them.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is not supposed to be an educational toy - just a fun one.  It is a great gadget/toy for adults as well as chidren.
0451232577|4.0|It makes me kinda sad to see this book's rating so low, because one reason is people hate the E-book price.  Well, i told myself that at least isn't as bad as people giving it one star for the actual content....but then i see a bunch of people did! How can this be? Did we read the same book?!?!??!?  The book is not only interesting, it is filled with typical great life-like characters that you find in all of Follet's books.  No, it is not quite as good as Pillars of the Earth, but i don't rate it based on that either.  I rate it based on how much i enjoyed THIS book, and i will admit there were a few slow parts, but for a book that is almost a thousand pages, i read this in 5 days and had a blast almost every page! Almost great, but still a VERY good book and absolutely worth the read.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|I really like it. I have a AT&T phone and it fits perfect. Haven't had too many drops so im not sure of the protection but I toss it around and its protected pretty well thus far.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja has one of the best ideas in gaming history. I never would've thought of ninjas hating fruit so much they would slice them randomly. Though the game doesn't tell you how to play, I quickly found out how to play. The weapons are cool, the backgrounds are great, and Sensi's Fruit Fun Facts told me stuff I never knew about fruit! Fruit Ninja is the best app ever!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun variety of games buy having to unlock the new is annoying. also a lot of ads. I do like that the app is free.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|bought this for my 8 year old who is learning to tell time, he loves to wear it.  Comfortable, easy to set the time, easy to add or remove links to adjust size and also easy for him to put on or take off.  Soccer fans will love this watch, it came with a lego figure too!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is an excellent set with all four movies in directors cut or origional version. The bluray discs are very good on the screen. This brought back the thrill of this really scary movie that had me looking under the be in 1979 and 2011!!
0061537969|5.0|This little story is awesome.  Told from the perspective of the family dog, Enzo, this story is full of love, compassion and sadness.<br /><br />Enzo is near the end of his life and reflects on all that has occurred in his life with Denny (his owner), Eve (Denny's wife) and daughter Zoe.<br /><br />My hat is off to Garth, I really doubt it is very easy to write a story in a dog's perspective.<br /><br />This is a great short read!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Very pleased with the product. It arrived in a timely manner, is very finely made, and is exactly what I wanted. Thank you very much.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|if you like seek and find games that involve more then just looking for stuff this is it!  become a detective and test your skills, works well on the kindle fire no known issues or glitches for me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Classic solitaire. I particularly enjoy the &quot;winning hand&quot; option that turns it into a game of skill rather than luck. I know that I can win the hand if I play well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It has lots and lots of games that you can unlock!I really enjoy these games.Plus the app is for free.
1439156816|5.0|This book is great if you are at all interested in the writing process.  Steven King does a great job explaining his process and giving excellent advice.  The book is very motivating and makes you want to write.  I purchased the book when it first came out, but have misplaced it.  When I saw the 10th anniversary addition, I had to have it.  I also bought one for my daughter.  Excellent choice!
B005PTYOTE|3.0|For anyone who doesn't already own the previous Blu-ray release of this trilogy, then now is the time to buy - But there's a caveat.<br /><br />But first, the quality of the films:<br /><br />Mission Impossible is a very well crafted film.  It has action, appropriately placed jokes to break the tension once in a while, and believe me, this film does a great job at keeping the tension palpable, and the acting is great all around.  It actually even adhered to the original series method of storytelling to a certain degree.  Top notch film for anyone who's a fan of suspense and action.<br /><br />Mission Impossible II... meh.  I enjoyed it for what it was, a mindless popcorn action flick.  Directed by John Woo (Broken Arrow/Face-Off), the M:I formula is thrown out of the window, the character of Ethan Hunt is transformed into a cocky arrogant, and the only thing remaining is lots and lots of action, which has a tendency to be a little hard to swallow at times.  That being said, it's still fun to watch.  This is pure action eye-candy, and if you're OK with that, you're going to have a lot of fun.  If not, well...<br /><br />...The Mission Impossible III at least comes in to save the franchise.  Directed by JJ Abrams (Alias, LOST, Star Trek), this film is a true return to form.  A great story that's paced out evenly and some mindblowing action.  Personally, it's still a shade under the original, but this film holds its own very well.<br /><br />The best thing about all three films is that they're all seperate entities for the most part, meaning, you don't have to see any film before you see the other.<br /><br />Now, back to that 'caveat' I was talking about - The audio.  It's all LOSSY audio, which is fairly inexcusable for a Blu-ray in this day and age.  Yes, it's true that this boxed set has the same exact encodes in video and audio the original releases had, and that was pretty early in the HD game, but that's STILL no excuse.  The studio really should have just takenthe lossless audio and made a new encode for this release.  So, what now?  Does the studio give us 'proper' releases after the fourth film hits Blu-ray?  My personal opinion is this - If they release a four film boxed set at that time, you're not going to get anything new from the original trilogy.  So you may as well pick this up now.  After all, the price is pretty stellar.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I bought this item on black friday for a great reduced price and I was so glad I did! This is one of my favorite shows and I truly enjoyed watching it over again on holiday break! The packaging is nice and smooth, the discs and cover art are very attractive. The booklet is useful and all of the deleted scenes provided great insight. I do feel though the bonus features were defiantly not as rich as season one, but that is totally overshadowed by the quality of the bonus features there are. All in all, great buy, great show, great purchase! 5 stars!
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I love these movies and I'm so glad to get them at a great price!! Amazon has always provided great services.
B005ZUR724|5.0|deffinatly the most fun app ive played on any mobile device. graphics are smooth and feel like everquest. price is steep, but well worth it.
1423113497|5.0|This is a really good series.  Too bad I did not find the book 1-5 boxed set at the time.  Each book is very addictive.  Very hard to put them down.  Once I started reading, I was hooked.  Highly recommend.
B004ECDNJU|3.0|If you're a person that likes puzzles, this game is for you. I'm not exactly a puzzle person, but I got it for free while they were having a special. If you're not a puzzle person, DON'T GET IT. I mean, I don't regret getting it, but that's because I got it for free. If you don't like puzzles, then it's definitely not worth paying for. And for everyone who's complaining about it not having a colorblind option, what do expect? I'm sorry, but there's a MINORITY of colorblind people in America. They're not gonna make a whole other game that like, 10% of Americans would buy because they're colorblind. Also, if you're colorblind and you bought a Kindle Fire, if you have any sense to think ahead, you wouldn't have gotten one for apps, because most apps have color in them. Believe it or not, Kindle Fires were made for people to read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have played a few versions of solitaire.  I found this one easy to use, i.e. options, user interface, etc. I would recommend this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|for those of you who play your apps constantly, I'm not sure you'd want this. it is an excellent time passer, and when you watch a show, its perfect for the comercials.
B005CA4SL0|4.0|Cape Fear is a very relevant movie that might have many court appt. attorney's thinking twice about there jobs.  All defense lawyers are supposed to represent there defendants fairly without prejudice, no matter what there opinion of the situation is and I guess you could say the same for the prosecution.  Would you prosecute for someone you thought was lying?  Sure, there are times where personal feelings can come into play when defending someone you know is guilty or did a terrible deed and all people have a right to feel that way, but if you are going to defend someone shouldn't your client have a right to a fair legal process.  This film might have you asking that question.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B0054JZC6E|3.0|When I first got this app, I did not know what to expect. But when I played it irealised it was very fun and addicting!
B002BE7JEI|4.0|Misery is a powerful film but don't think would call it a horror movie. Very intense, suspenseful film that has quite a good story to it. Maybe people can relate to it on how a die hard fan of a celebrity or someone famous takes there obsession a little to far. It does remind me some of 'the fan' but much more of an edge of your seat atmosphere. The movie is played often on the basic cable channels still being it is over 20 years old. If you have not seen it and like very suspense type movies, give it a try.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B00006CXSS|5.0|I ordered the incorrect item for my husband. after contacting this person they were very kind to tell e to refuse it. Instead of returning it I have decided to give it to another family member. Thank you for your assistance in this item. Will definitely order from this person again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I also could not put this book down. Book two took a little longer to read but still very good. I can't wait to see how book three ends.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Lion King is a great family movie  We love it!!! Disney always have the best movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks so much  The shipping was great too
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|A Google Reader app was a key requirement for me on the Kindle Fire. While not as beautiful as Reeder on iOS this program works really well. It's fast and gets out of the way when reading. Wish mp3 streaming would work however.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|If I were alone on a desert island with this album, I wouldn't stay long. Signed, a David Gilmour fan.
B000HLDFK4|5.0|Thank you very much for the service.<br />I recommend the movie, the story is really cute haha.<br /><br />Thank you again.
1594744769|2.0|Really dark, creepy book. The photos alone are enough to haunt a person. Don't believe anyone who says it's \\"for all ages\\".  Amazon is requiring that I assign \\"stars\\" to the book itself...which is unfair to the book.   I just don't want anyone to unknowingly purchase this for a young person (as I did).
B003HARV4S|5.0|Thank you very much for the service.<br />I recommend the movie is very interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />Thank you again !!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My kids love it.We can watch it again and again.Adults like it just as much.Present for every age and event.
0684847248|5.0|I loved this book and its so cheap!! i am so happy I found this book. Thanks so much for everything!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Addicting as heck. Fabulous for all ages. Best app I've seen for the kindle yet. Yes, I wish the zen garden and such were included, but its still awesome.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down!! Loved every moment of it. Very excited to read the next book. I hope Peeta and Katniss get together in the next book. The way he loves her is so amazing!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game and definitely priced right. The puzzles are short and sweet and harder than they look. I would recommend to anyone.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have read the book as well as seen the movie, and unlike others who have commented about disliking the differences between the two, I rather enjoyed the changes that were made to the story to bring it to life as a film. Although I am very fond of the book, I think that the story would be too plodding to make a film out of if you stuck too faithfully to the story or included ALL of the \\"important lines\\". I was saddened to see the '96 adaptation and see how certain lines were 'dumbed down' to make them more understandable to a modern audience. The casting is impeccable and Mia Wasikowska in particular blew me away. Her face is so changeable that even though there may be less dialogue in this adaptation than others before it, you can actually see the thoughts behind her expression and the deliverance of her lines is full of feeling. Some people complain that she is too pretty to play Jane, but I think she was actually perfect because she has a quiet bare faced serenity that at first glance seems plain, but her whit, her voice, and the way she carries herself in the movie really bring to life the beauty that Rochster begins to see in her. She is quite like the Mona Lisa in that she looks like she has a secret world behind her eyes. I think that the acting of all of the cast and the dialogue make the story more real and gets to the heart of the story more effectively than others have. I also loved the \\"lost on the moors\\" scene and feel that it is much more expressive of Jane's agony of having to tear herself away from Rochester than her just running down a lane and hitching a ride in a passing carriage. The lighting used is just the same as people would really have had back them, candlight, firelight, sunlight. It really added to the authenticity of the film for me in addition to the wonderful costumes. Lastly the score is gorgeous and really reinforces the scenes to the fullest! If you enjoy love stories, this beautifully shot movie is for you!
B0063IH60K|4.0|love this! love playing this on my kindle fire! so easy to download, very quick. great way to pass the time.
B004HD61KE|3.0|This was a good book if not my favorite by Rollins. There was a lot of action but not so much suspense. You never really believe the main characters are in danger. The mystery of the \\"Devil Colony\\" was interesting but I wish he had played it up more. I like that Seichan is playing a bigger part, but the Sigma Force world is getting crowded. I kind of wish he'd kill off one or two and actually leave them dead. One thing I really hated was the bad guys kill innocent people mostly for the heck of it, but when they have a chance to kill some of the heroes and a loved one, they \\"leave them to die.\\" I don't expect tired cliches from Rollins. Otherwise it was a good book. Just not as great as his usual books.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|You can't go wrong with this game.  A very solid addittion to everyone's game library. Smooth graphics, no glitches, and great feel and responsiveness. I think this is one of the top 5 games on the kindle fire.  I wish that the small menu bar at the bottom of the screen would go away but that is no fault of the game. If you are looking for hours of entertainment then look no further than Angry Birds.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Excellent combo movie, in High Definition performance, with extra gift. This product is special for comic collector.one of the best movie in the year.
0385334206|5.0|Book came on time and in good condition. I have had some problems recently and just wanted to create this review to reward the good service I received.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Another best movie of the year, excellent movie combo in high definition performance, with extra gift for another divice reproduction, this product is special for comic collector.
B005ZUR724|5.0|The game itself is pretty great. A top notch mobile WoW clone. However they're currently having a few day lag in between updates posting to Amazon which causes the game to be unplayable during that time. This is pretty crappy indeed since you're missing out on time you've paid to be able to play the game. At the same time, at most you've spent $0.99 per month. I can't see myself freaking out that much over a dime at most.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Excellent movie in a high definition performance with a digital copy for ipad or personal computer, part of the best marvel comic movie in the year, special for comic collectors.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really love this app and all the different reading plans, ease of use great features also, bookmark,share,notes, languages and you can help friends to download.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this Bible keeper me reading Gods word each night I encourage others to become Christians and download this app. :)
0439023521|5.0|Hands down the best book I've ever read, and I don't even like fiction, especially sci-fi books that much.  Recommending it to all of my friends.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|The staging here is a bit unconventional.  It puts the characters in modern dress to act out a story that could only take place in a past era.  It also contained some apparently symbolic elements, such as minor characters costumed as predatory animals and a bit of nudity, but it worked for me.  The singing is superb, particularly from Rigoletto and his daughter (the Duke's voice struck me as a little thin in tone).  The only objection I can muster is that the audio balance emphasized the voices at the expense of the orchestra.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|This is a fun, addictive, logic game.  Works perfectly on the Kindle Fire.  Start with the slow speed until you get the hang of it then work your way up.  It is easy to master.
031237593X|5.0|This was the first time to read a book by Sharon Kay Penman but definitely not the last.  I absolutely loved it.  \\"ANNE\\"   Now have There Be Dragons.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|This is a really fun game with amazing detail, and an addictive story line. However, five dollars for one game is a bit much in my opinion, which is why I am giving it the four star rating. The price is a big drawback for me.
B0063IH60K|4.0|its cool and its like my teacher while I'm on break I need to write nine more words so ill stall
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoyed the complete function of this app.  The online ads are no worry.  Works best in landscape mode on Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this.app. their are so many choices and it makes you work to unlock other games. I highly recommend this app to others if you want something fun to do ifor free.
1451648537|5.0|First and foremost, this is just a good read.  I found that Isaacson's bio of Einstein was both interesting and did a profoundly better job of explaining relativity than my physics professors ever did.  This book didn't disappoint.  It was both captivating, and offered meaningful insight into Steve Jobs and the history of Apple.  On way of my own biases, I was an Apple bigot before being an Apple bigot was cool.  I learned to program on an Apple II that my father brought home in 1980.  I've been a shareholder since I was given a single share of Apple stock for my bar mitzvah in 1981.  I later grew up using Macs in college for everything from writing papers to digital circuit simulation to writing shareware apps that paid off debt I had accumulated as a starving grad student and provided the down payment on my first home.  I even continued to use a Mac (eventually a PowerPC clone) as my exclusive home computer during most of my tenure with IBM!  But around 1998-99, I finally gave up on Macs and bought my first PC.  By then I had concluded that Windows hadn't simply caught up, but in many regards had surpassed the Mac.  Mac had become a lesser computer that cost a premium, for which applications were fewer in number, and cost more.  Even after Apple finally made substantial improvements and moved to a Unix kernel, I've never been tempted to look back.  What's more, as Apple entered the consumer electronics domain and began producing closed devices and systems characterized by excessive proprietary control, I developed a decidedly anti-Apple viewpoint.  Not a reflexive anti-Apple bias -- I did eventually start using a hand-me-down iPod when my daughter just had to upgrade to a iTouch.  And we eventually all got iPhones after I concluded that, whatever it's limitations, it was still a better option than the available Android alternatives.  But you get the point -- I'm now closer to being an anti-Apple bigot than one of the hordes of Apple fans.  This book provides realinsight into why Apple systems are as closed as they are, and why Apple acts as controlling as it does.  It provides a good understanding of just how Steve Jobs drove Apple to where it is today.  Ultimately, the book does not paint a flattering picture of Jobs.  I've read other reviewers who complained that Isaacson clearly disliked Jobs, and that the book was a hatchet job.  I've seen Isaacson doing interviews since Jobs' death, however, and if anything, I'd say the opposite is true.  I think he actually holds Jobs in awe.  (Those who find the description of Jobs as such an unrelenting jerk incompatible with the extremely strong positive feelings expressed by many who worked with him have clearly never worked with somebody of his ilk, and fail to recognize something basic in human psychology.  When people go through what is effectively prolonged hazing, one of two things happen: either they part ways prior to completion, in which cases they are left only with enormous resentment over the hazing/bad behavior, or they survive the hazing and feel empowered and strongly bound to the others involved, as a result.  What you would expect from those who worked closely with/for Jobs is precisely a polarized love or hate reaction.  But even those who come out with strong positive feelings will still very much recognize, and likely even resent, the bad behavior.)  I've also seen complaints that the book gives short shrift to specific events or aspects of Jobs' life.  That strikes me as inevitable.  The book is ~600 pages as it is.  I think the purpose of the book is to provide meaningful insight into Jobs, including what formed him and what he formed, not to comprehensively document each and every aspect and occurrence of his life.  Are there places where the book is lacking?  Yes, I think so.  The book suggests that there was a substantial change in Jobs -- a maturation -- between his initial stint with Apple and his second run there.  But if he became more reasonable and effective at his interpersonal interactions with Apple employees in his second stint, that certainly wasn't apparent to me from the book.  In any case, whatever its limitations, and whatever your feelings toward Apple or Steve Jobs, this book is enlightening and entertaining, and well worth the read.  P.S. For the record, this is the first book I've read in it's entirety on an eReader.  (A Kindle Fire -- perhaps there's some irony there.)

B005NUFU9S|4.0|For me theme is important in a story, so I nearly hated this episode, but I changed how I looked and it, so it ended up teaching me something. Rather than believing the twist from a narrator's point of view, I interpret the twist from Amy's point of view, in her scary room, the way she sees the Doctor. I think losing her trust is what Amy is afraid of, and the original plot is the way to interpret the end, for me. Do you want to leave with the new red car, or is he worth staying?
1400069181|5.0|Are you wishing you could be part of something bigger? Something beyond yourself? You're not sure how to reach out and be that, not sure where to start? This is the book for you.   Blake Mycoskie, who wrote the book, \\"Start Something that Matters\\" founded the TOMS Shoe company in 2006. The idea of TOMS is simple and yet the core of the company: \\"With every pair you purchase, TOMS will give a pair of new shoes to a child in need. One for One.\\"   In this book, Blake shares how his company became a raging success in fashion, and has provided shoes for over one million children in need. Blake starts out his book by sharing his story - the mistakes, successes, joys, pains and all, and then goes on to help you find your story. To figure out what defines you and what you what do to. But more importantly, why you want to do it. He encourages you to face your fears - with real life examples of people who did, and conquered, and became part of a movement that matters.    The book is not full of tips of what to do and what not to do, but rather finding the core of \\"why\\". Why you want to start something that matters, because the strongest and most successful people, businesses and charities in the world have centered themselves around why they do what they do, not what it is they do. Then he leads on to show you how incorporating giving into a central part of who you are, who your business or charity is, can change your life and the world.   Blake focuses on key core values such as being resourceful, having open, honest communication, simplicity, and of course giving back. But this book is mostly about finding you. Finding what you believe in, and why. It is an inspiring book that makes being part of a movement that makes a difference, whether small or large, reachable and tangible to everyone out there.. you. Not just people with lots of contacts and money and resources, but every single one of us. You and I can be part of the change in the world, and for you, it could startby reading this book.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|This movie is mis-promoted as a thriller; in the almost 2 hours this movie plays out there might be 5 minutes of thriller.  The remainder is a tightly wound man, Jack, an assassin who is nearing the end of his career / job.<br /><br />This movie reminds me of the very old Spaghetti Westerns, slow, a seriously too long look at the subject matter (Jack/George) and the scenery ...  The story is lighter than light, milder than mild.  If you like looking at George, you get to see him here fully.  He only talks briefly throughout the movie.<br /><br />When I first saw the \\"Hang 'em\\" series I didn't like them; now of course they are a cult classical series and reignited the career of Clint Eastwood...  The American will never become a classic and luckily for George, his career doesn't need a jump-start...<br /><br />This movie cost about $20Mil to make, grossed almost $68Mil and that's a very low gross for an actor with Clooney's \\"star-power\\"...  reflecting the \\"vibe\\" that the public didn't enjoy this flick...  they withheld their $$$ and saw some other movie...<br /><br />I like the movies a lot, find \\"George\\" easy to look at, but if I had to see this movie again, I would consider it torture...  My husband watched it with me also and at it's conclusion said \\"what was that about?\\"<br /><br />Find another movie you'll enjoy more.

B0000024W3|3.0|Make no mistake, \\"Self Portrait\\" is pretty damn far from being one of Dylan's best, and is rightfully ranked in the lower echelons of his catalog. However, for all the vitriol lobbed at it over the years, it may be worth noting that \\"Self Portrait\\" is also at a comfortable distance from being Dylan's worst recording. For what it infamously set out to be - a quirky attempt to further distance fans who pined for Dylan to remain the rebellious voice of the 1960s' - it succeeds quite well, and while there are some truly awful moments to be found on the record, there are also quite a few charming and even excellent moments there, too.<br /><br />Most of \\"Self Portrait\\" originates from around the time of the \\"Nashville Skyline\\" sessions, and that album's country influence is largely prevalent throughout the record. Most of the record is covers, some done well, some not so well. Among the better attempts are Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Early Morning Rain,\\" The Everly Brothers' \\"Let It Be,\\" and various folk ballads such as the gorgeous \\"Copper Kettle\\" (one of the best vocals of his career) and the obscure Celtic tune \\"Belle Isle.\\" There are some misfires, such as a drab take on \\"I Forgot More Than You Ever Know\\" (done to much better effect in 1986 with Tom Petty), and a laughably awkward take on Simon & Garfunkel's \\"The Boxer\\" with a double tracked Dylan duetting himself in country crooner and traditional Dylan modes. Overall, while some tracks do not succeed as admirably as others, there's nothing on here inherently embarassing, and despite the 'outtake' quality nature of the recordings, Dylan sounds surprisingly engaged most of the time.<br /><br />There are some oddball cuts on the record as well, such as the opening \\"All the Tired Horses, which does not feature Dylan but a chorus of singers repeating the title for three minutes over a rising string arrangement, and \\"Wigwam,\\" whose weirdness cannot be defined in words. The worst tracks, surprisingly are the Dylan originals. \\"Livin' the Blues\\" is a pleasant enough number, and \\"The Mighty Quinn\\" is of course a classic but the version chosen here, done with The Band at the Isle of Wight, is abysmal. The same can be said for the disastrous versions of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (Bob stumbles over every verse and the arrangement doesn't fit the song at all) and \\"She Belongs to Me.\\" The Isle of Wight show was generally considered a success by most, so Bob must have deliberately chosen the worst performances from the show to further piss off fans.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Self Portrait\\" is far from a great album and one of Dylan's overall weakest, but the total result is still an interesting listen that will surprise you in some instances.pleasant enough number, and \\"The Mighty Quinn\\" is of course a classic but the version chosen here, done with The Band at the Isle of Wight, is abysmal.

0553386794|4.0|Ok, so this is probably wildly unpopular of me, but I found A Game of Thrones to be only average.  After all the hype and build up I'd experienced for this novel I expected something amazing.  And well, it wasn't.  I'm not saying it wasn't a good book, but it wasn't something wholly original and marvelous either.<br /><br />Upheaval seems to be nothing new for the world A Game of Thrones takes place in.  There are always intrigues and other things to keep people on their toes.  Among them, the family Stark has been charged with upholding honor and in their frozen north it seems honor may be all they have compared to the wealth of the southern cities.  But when Lord Stark is called to be the hand of the King, he is thrust into politics and danger lurks at every corner.  And whether he likes it or not, his children are involved in one way or another as well.  In a different part of the land, Deny, a young princess has just been made bridge to the lord of a fierce and wild tribe.  Descended from Kings and outcasted, she knows in her blood that she is the last of the dragons.  She wants to regain her homeland, but with a crazed brother and new rules to learn with her new tribe, she wonders if she will be able to be strong enough to rule.<br /><br />So while the Starks are the main characters of this novel, Deny is my favorite.  She is a very intriguing character.  Young, but with a good head on her shoulders and strong when she needs to be.  But she can also be brutal which makes her interesting.  The Starks are ok, especially Jon, the son sent to guard the dangerous wall to the North.  He has a lot of compassion despite the way he is treated so often.  The other Stark kids I didn't find as fascinating, and honestly, a good portion of them were just annoying and sniveling.  Their father wasn't very likable either as he seemed like an idiot with some of his decisions.  The bad guys are ok, and can be very menacing at times.<br /><br />This book is very brutal.  There is rape, incest, war, abuse, and a myriad of other harsh topics.  Its not for the light hearted.  Some of it even made me cringe a bit.  But the writing, when its flowing smoothly is good.  My main complaint about this book is the amount it bounces around.  Each chapter seems to be from a different point of view and I would have preferred to just have a couple point of views that maybe covered a couple chapters at a time instead.  It would have made the book easier to follow.  And in the beginning its definitely hard to follow with all the characters introduced and things going on.  By the end of the book I was all caught up on who was who, but it lessened my enjoyment that it took so long to have that happen.  The book wasn't extremely original either.  While there were some elements that were I recognized bits and pieces from all over. And maybe Martin did have some of those elements first but he couldn't have had them all.  Still entertaining reading and I like the fantasy genre so I can't bash it too hard, but I'm not going to proclaim it wonderful either.<br /><br />A solid 3.5 stars from me.  I'll definitely read the rest of the series and take a look at the tv show, but there are other fantasies I'd put ahead of it.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones<br />Copyright 1996<br />807 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

As it's my first Adam's CD, I did not know it's a rock/country cross-over.  I don't call my self a country fan but enjoy rock and folk but this CD is incredible.  I can't wait to try more of Ryan Adams music.  This CD is beautiful and I am guessing one of the best for the year 2011.

B000YAA68W|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. This is one of those rare movies which seems to me to reach near perfection and succeeds in every imaginable way. There is simply so much to praise in this little movie I am not sure where to begin. I should offer my SPOILER ALERT at this point as well since I do give away some of what happens in the movie.<br /><br />The story is really a coming of age story set mostly in Iran. The movie provides a very basic history lesson in regard to Iran's recent history which is interesting in its own right. The protagonist of the story, Marjane Satrapi, lives through the overthrow of the Shah, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, as well as the Iran-Iraq war. As a coming of age story the themes of the movie are universal but it is set against a very unique background and has a political message as well. Marjane's parents send her to school in Vienna and we see her struggling to find her place and her identity as an Iranian. She falls in with a group of dissident, counter-culture types but never really fits in. None of them have backgrounds even remotely resembling her own. She has a failed romance before returning to Iran. Marjane is clearly someone who is, like all of us, struggling to find her place.<br /><br />The movie is apparently based on the autobiographical graphic novel of the same name by Marjane Satrapi. The movie is animated but it is animated in a very unique way. The style of animation seems to have been chosen in order to recreate the feel of a graphic novel or comic book on film. At first I was not sure whether I was going to like the style of animation in this movie, it seemed so different from what I was used to, but it really worked exceptionally well for this film. In a comic book a continuous story is constructed through discontinuous frames. This forces a kind of minimalism on the story. Everything has to be distilled down to its essence. You get maybe six frames a page and a few lines so those lines have to be well chosen. There is no room for extraneous details. Something similar happens in this film. The whole movie is told in this very minimalist way and yet the producers of this movie succeed brilliantly in capturing the essence of everything that happens to Marjane. The story of Marjane's first love, for example, is told in a very compact number of frames and yet this film succeeds in presenting a much fuller and truer picture of first love than any movie I have ever seen and with more insight (the transformation of her first love's image after she discovers him cheating on her for example).<br /><br />Another example is the scene between Marjane and her husband where she is looking for her car keys while he is watching the Terminator. She asks him where the car keys are in an angry way and he turns up the volume on the t.v. and then she finds them in her pocket. All of their marital problems are condensed into that one scene. Somehow in that one scene of Marjane looking for her car keys we get a sense of the entire marriage and its deterioration. A typical hollywood movie would have portrayed the deterioration of the marriage quite differently. First, it probably would turned the husband (or Marjane) into a villain perhaps through infidelity. It then would have brought the deteriorating relationship to a head with a dramatic fight scene. Hollywood trades drama for realism and truth. This movie captures the essence of a deteriorating marriage without turning anyone into a villain and without over-dramatizing.<br /><br />This minimalist style is like having to express everything you have to say in a single sentence. Most movies can ramble on and on and never have anything truly interesting or profound or even true to say. The opposite is the case with this film. This film cuts right to the essential truths of its subject matter without rambling on and on. It is really quite amazing.<br /><br />And the film is entirely devoid of sentimentality or cliche. There is not a false note in this movie. So much on screen emotion feels so utterly false. People are portrayed as they think they are supposed to feel rather than how they actually would feel. This movie is a breath of fresh air. Every emotion in the film is real.<br /><br />Besides being a universal coming of age story the movie also has some interesting and important political themes. It is clear after watching this movie that the values that we tend to think of as Western values, such as individual liberty, freedom of expression, women's rights, democracy, etc. are not, in reality, uniquely Western. Oppression is oppression wherever and whenever it exists and the human spirit rebels against oppression wherever it is found. Marjane Satrapi is more courageous than most in expressing her opposition to oppression but she finds sympathy from nearly everyone around her. The majority of the Iranian people are not happy with their oppressive system (as evidenced by the recent protests there) and this movie documents the Iranian's struggles quite beautifully.<br /><br />The characters are all fully drawn especially Marjane, her parents, and her grandmother with whom Marjane has a special bond. There is a great deal of humor in the movie despite the fact that it is often dealing with heavy themes. This really is a nearly perfect movie. It combines laughter with sadness, comedy with tragedy, personal growth set amidst political turmoil. It deals with its themes (love, coming of age, life in a foreign country, political oppression and resistance to oppression, etc.) in a profound way. The animation is beautiful. The characters are extremely memorable. The movie is extremely unique without being artsy for artsiness sake. And you get a free, short, history lesson on Iran to boot!<br /><br />When I read the description of this movie I was really only mildly interested in watching it. But I was visiting my family and they wanted to watch it so I acquiesced and it turned out to be the best movie I have seen in a long time. If you are at all on the fence about this movie I highly recommend giving it a try.

030788743X|4.0|I listened to the audiobook, and I'm 1/3 of the way through my second listen. Take it from someone who has attempted to write a book that's filled with fantastical things happening with a hip sensibility. It's very hard to do. I give him bonus points for filling in the pop cultural references in all the right places. Yes, the plot is a little clunky at times. I started the book, listened to an hour, waited a week and then started again before it grabbed me. Towards the end, there was a good flow and I couldn't wait to see how it ended.  Admittedly, there were a few instances where the references fell flat. There is a reference to the game Tempest that was so obvious that I didn't buy that a character who immersed himself in 80s pop culture didn't make a connection to it.   Maybe I fell in love with the concept of the OASIS. I'd love to be able to do the things the players are able to do in the OASIS.   This book will obviously appeal to those of us who obsess over pop culture. No, I don't go \\"Woo!\\" when a band mentions the name of my city at a concert. No, I've never worked at a music/video store. To each their own. To put it simply, if you didn't like this book, it probably wasn't for you.   There have been numerous attempts to geek up shows with video game references, but they usually fall flat or are just plain embarrassing (The X-Files' episode about a virtual reality game comes to mind.). The author was able to take a plot that takes place about 2/3 of the time inside a video game and make it compelling. It's a great accomplishment.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|this is an amazing movie. it starts out a bit slow, but once it hits its stride around midway through, it just doesn't let go. i couldn't believe how good the two main actors were, and nolte was pretty good too, though he is clearly just doing some version of his usual routine. do yourself a favor and give this a watch - i don't think you'll be disappointed.

If you like literature, you will love how various are brought to life. Really wanted to be Owen in this film and engage all those writers and their ladies. Highly recommend.

B006O5XYWG|4.0|Not a big fan of all the Planet-Ape movies but thought perhaps special effects alone would make this worth viewing. Well like the movie! Plot is so-so but moves along well and great special effects. Would recommend. No deep meaning, but fun to watch.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was nice to be able to slow down the fireballs for certain levels so I could keep track. Even on the slowest setting some of the levels could still be pretty challenging at first. I played this on Kindle Fire. Probably would be harder on a small phone.  Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is that there aren't enough levels. I finished the whole thing in a couple of hours. I also wish there was some bonus for finishing every level with a perfect score.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like Evernote so much that I pay for their premium service. Works great on my Mac, PC, iPhone, iPad, Kindle Fire, and on Logitech Review with Google TV. It keeps all of my notes synchronized across all of my devices. Highly recommended

B001W2I9Y4|5.0|This album is by far the greatest of all time in my estimation. In fact, as far as my personal preferences go, it has edged out Tool's Aenima for that number one slot (just barely though). Although featuring the recognizable Mastodon sound, the style shifted to a more Zeppelin style sensibility. Additionally, it could easily be considered a modern day rock opera, at least from a continuity and theme standpoint. I can't honestly think of another album that manages to capture a specific sound as energetically or as soul grippingly (new word?) as this. The first time i heard it, i was almost stunned by its brilliance. Completely genius composition and execution. There may never be another album like it again. If you dont own this, or havent listened to it all the way through, you owe it to yourself. I understand there are people that wont appreciate the album, but if you are reading this review, you arent one of them. Buy it if you havent already. It is a truly timeless effort.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0034G4OVS|5.0|I dont understand all the negative reviews. I thought this was a very well done and suspenseful movie about three friends being trapped on a ski lift overnight and the terror that ensues as a result of them being exposed to the elements. Yes this move had a lot of that \\"Murphy's Law\\" element going on similar to the Final Destination movies where everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. But I thought it was done in very suspenseful, intelligent and believable way. The acting was outstanding and the characters conveyed desperation and terror quite realistically.   There are many nail biting and cringe worthy moments where the characters go through strong physical turmoil and torture as a result of being trapped in the permanent frost, with icy winds pinching their faces like sharp needles and skin frozen on the metal. What I liked was that everything happening to them made sense, like when you fall from that high up, you break your legs in the nastiest way. The POV shot they used for that was quite unsettling and my heart skipped a beat when i heard the crack and saw the exposed bones upon impact. This movie is pure survival of the human vs nature kind. The only thing that was a bit unbelievable were the bloodthirsty wolves. I didnt know wolves attacked humans, especially not in posh ski resorts  where they are used to the presence of humans and in fact are more scared of us more than anything. That just didnt seem very believable.   Other than that, this is a suspenseful and quite entertaining movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat at all times. I dont know why people always insist on psychoanalyzing characters in movies, accusing them of not enough depth in demeanor and conversations they hold. Who cares that their dialogues dont convey in depth analysis of Faulkner's works, they are a bunch of friends on a ski resort trying to get away from it all. Not that this movie was about that.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Did not know what to expect although had seen trailer for this in movie theater way before released. Liked it. Well paced, acting is good and plot base is believable. Not a super action, car crash, explosions movie but still very enjoyable. Recommend.
B001608R5I|5.0|Well, it's great music, and it's a very well done vinyl. Comes with all kinds of good stuff, and in a beautiful box. I gave it to a friend of mine for her birthday and she loves it. I want one for myself as well.

B004EPYZUS|5.0|Disavowed by the US government and stripped of their usual resources, the IMF team (Tom Cruise, Paula Patton, Jeremy Renner & Simon Pegg) must foil a mad nuclear strategist (Michael Nyqvist) bent on reinvigorating humanity by instigating a nuclear holocaust, which he believes will push humanity into a survival-of-the-fittest struggle that will lead to the next level of evolution.  (Hey, fundamentalists: You can use this movie to underline the basic unholiness of evolutionists!)  Combined with the solid MI3, this series is now firmly established as a dependable action franchise.  Director Brad Bird and screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec have strung together a series of eye-popping set pieces while still telling an engaging story full of set-backs, reverses, and surprises.  An added dimension of suspense comes from the failure of their magical technology at crucial times, requiring the team to improvise at a moment's notice.  A thoroughly enjoyable time at the movies.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app to remember all of my passwords and usernames also my email...... I love it u will to!!!

B0059XTTW8|3.0|As a work of film craft, its very well done. The acting, the direction, the script and the visuals are all of the very highest order. Its a technical work of a very high order. I had my doubts going in as to how they could compress such a large work effectively into the limits of a single film. But they did it very well. The script is almost a work of art in terms of pushing maximum story and plot in a minimum time.   But is this a good or great film. Probably not. For the story to work (in my opinion), the viewer has to care about the suspects and more importantly the viewer has to believe that none of these men could possibly be the mole until shown that one is the mole. But the characters are basically voids or ciphers. We don't know them really at all. And because we don't know them, it makes little difference to the audience which of them is guilty in the end.   The biggest actual flaw in the film is toward the end where the mole is given an opportunity to explain himself....and effectively doesn't. He throws out a couple brief lines about asthetics. Realism aside, that explaination is the payoff to the detective story in the film. The payoff in this case is missing. The audience is presented with a guilty character who they care little about who can't even explain his actions. Not a great way to end the film. The payoff is something that the TV version got right.  The cinematography is by the nature of the work confused. The story (the novel) is really a 1950s story set in the 1970s. The film really can't recreate either so it provides a sort of lost-in-time mixed up version that combines modern behavior with old machines serving as set dressing. They capture a sort of state of decay in the immediate surroundings but they never really manage to capture the state of decay in the broader society of either the 1950s or the 1970s which is of course important to the story in terms of the motivations of the mole.  The film will work as a complex detective yarn for some. It will work better for those who saw the earlier television version and probably best of all for those who have read the book. The more the viewer knows about the story, the less the flaws of the film will matter. The more known about the characters going in, the less the lack of character development among the mole suspects will matter.
B0058RN85O|1.0|Pathetic and unfunny. They're all dumbed down, politically correct stereotypes of what they're portrayed as, and they're all pathetic at that. They're all upper-middle class snobs always bitching about something, something a normal person could easily avoid, &quot;by thinking&quot;. The heterosexual male is the weakest link of the show which is typical for it's time. The females are all dressed like &quot;uniform prostitutes&quot;, also typical. In a time when gays and feminist women have invaded the media I wasn't expecting anything good but I wasn't expecting it to be this low and degradingly stupid. This DVD shouldn't be allowed near children, avoid like the plague.
B000641D2Y|4.0|My husband's favorite holiday movies are the first 2 Home Alone movies. I was having a hard time finding them in stores and a friend suggested getting them online. It was only a few weeks until we were to fly home for the holidays and I was concerned that the movies would not be shipped to our home in time. My friend assured me that Amazon was always had quick delivery and ordering online would be super simple. She was right! This selller had the movie I ordered at my home with plenty of time to spare. I will be checking online for good deals before hitting the stores from now on. Thanks! :)

B004LUS390|3.0|I loved this app until today. I have only had it for two weeks and it crashes when I try to open a previous drawing for editing. This problem only happened occasionally before, but now it has rendered this app useless for me (I use one base figure repeatedly and save a copy of the file to make a different composition).  That being said, if you have a compatible device, don't hesistate to buy this app. It was intuitive and user-friendly...when it worked. Wish I had read reviews from other kindle fire users.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought the series. It was an amazing story of courage, love and conviction!  Katniss was an amazingly written character. Once you start reading,  you'll want to read the whole series. It took me only 2 days. I felt like I was there with her. I cried. I laughed. I was angry. It was emotionally charged. I highly recommend it!

B004LWZW42|4.0|I thought \\"X-Men: First Class\\" was enjoyable on many levels. I liked the first 2 films well enough, and I enjoyed seeing this prequel.<br /><br />I've heard arguments from friends that the characters aren't as sophisticated and, as such, not believable.<br /><br />I kept in mind that these are young teens coming to terms, and it all made perfect sense. Their personal discoveries were entertaining, and I have no complaint with this film at all. Matthew Vaughn did a fine job, and I still think Jennifer Lawrence was fine, as a naive teen flirt.
0425241505|4.0|It all starts with the theft of a 1962 penny. Yes, a penny. That one cent causes a ton of trouble of Pia, as well as for its owner, Dragos. Pia runs, Dragos finds her, goblins find them, and hijinks ensue! Yep, pretty silly plot, but it took over 100 pages to catch my attention. Although at that point I still didn't have a good sense about who the characters were. Aside from her mysterious \\"what kind of supernatural creature are you\\" trait, I didn't really know what kind of person Pia was. She seemed like a hopeless romantic, and maybe standoffish, but other than that, nothing.<br /><br />Dragos was arrogant, controlling and possessive, but that's to be expected from a many millennium old multi-billionaire dragon. He's also really hott! However...How can a being that has been around since the beginning of time not know what a Slurpee, Twizzlers, or Ziplock bags are? I know he really has no use for these seemingly random items, but come on! He's been in the human world for a long time. :P<br /><br />This was a fun, light read but nothing about it really stood out to me. Except for the Sex & the City reference! It may have been accidental, but probably not, and I loved it! The story does pick up near the end and was very enjoyable. I'll definitely be checking out the rest of the series.
1419702238|5.0|As promised, this book reigns things in a bit, returning with a pared-down cast of characters: Greg Heffley and his family members, with a few mentions of his best friend Rowley. Like the earlier books in the series, this is a series of loosely-connected vignettes featuring Greg's family and friends. Middle-child Greg is just as self-centered as always and the family dynamics are very believable. Be careful what you wish for: in the last book, The Ugly Truth, I was a bit disappointed that Greg seemed to be growing up too fast. In this volume, Greg actually seems younger than he did in previous books. It's winter time, Christmas is around the corner, and Greg is more than a little creeped out by the idea that Santa is watching his every move! I did find it a bit of a stretch that Greg, who should be in 8th grade by now, would still actually believe in Santa Claus, but this was the crux of so many great jokes, that I didn't care. Just go with it!<br /><br />More than ever, readers will see that Greg is a bright troublemaker, who means well, but can't seem to do anything right. When he puts up posters at school which are rained on, it leaves a mess, and he's terrified that the police will arrest him for vandalism. I think my favorite parts of the book are the flashbacks when we see a slightly younger Greg - for example, when Greg's younger brother Manny is a newborn, his mom buys Greg a baby doll to get him used to the idea of being a big brother. Young Greg loves that doll! Greg is adorable as he dotes over it, and readers are treated to a great picture of him caring for the doll as his mother sizes him up approvingly and his father looks on in mild alarm. Greg's always felt guilty for losing track of the doll - but it turns up after the basement is flooded. After years of neglect the doll is missing a leg and covered with muck so that it looks like something from a horror show - which in Greg's eyes only makes it cooler.<br /><br />When a blizzard hits, Greg's dad is forced to hole up in a hotel and spends the holidays in peace and quiet in the warm comfort of his room. I was reminded strongly of the father from Calvin and Hobbes. Greg's older brother Roderick has been the baddie in previous books, but in this volume Manny is the villain. When the family is snowed in, and the house loses power, fussy toddler Manny craftily hoards all the best resources for himself. It's another bit of a stretch to think that little Manny could successfully adjust the house fuse boxes himself, but the story moves so quickly, I didn't mind it. And we have to give Manny credit - he's probably learned a lot by watching Greg in action. Who was once the student is now the master!<br /><br />This book is hilarious - I found myself laughing out loud, making embarrassing snorting noises, and demanding to read-aloud random portions to anyone who would listen. It's bust-a-gut funny and everything you hope for in a humor novel. I highly recommend it.in a hotel and spends the holidays in peace and quiet in the warm comfort of his room.

B003IEJZUG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, though it was a slow start. I believed the story and that kept me wanting to read it to the end. I found the religious references quite appropriate in light of the character. I did not feel the book to be \\"preachy\\", but it did invoke some interesting considerations. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, albeit incredible story.
B00005JKYI|5.0|I'd heard there's a remake of \\"Footloose\\", and heard it's very good. I plan to see it, eventually, but you can't deny that Herbert Ross' 1984 original is worthy. Kevin Bacon was given his first solo lead, and it was the start of a prestigious career.<br /><br />I put this on New Year's Eve, after a few years, and it's a fresh today as when I first saw it. The music is original and exciting, 2 of the songs nommed for Oscars (Why not \\"Almost Paradise?)<br /><br />Anyway, I believe the excellent cast was in on making a monumental, indeed, groundbreaking film. Newcomer Lori Singer was fine, though I haven't heard about her lately. John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest, John Laughlin, and a particularly adorable performance by the late Chris Penn, all create an ensemble cast that is as good as it gets.<br /><br />Good script; good messages for all.<br />Let's dance!

I wanted more the minute it was over; so ordered the rest of the trilogy and will probably not leave my seat until I finish Book TWO. Can't wait.

B005TQAI6G|4.0|We can all admit it ... There's something about Britney Spears that just keeps you interested. As a country, we watched her rise and fall, harder than most celebrities ever do. We then got the privilege of watching her return, and while her 2008 comeback album 'Circus', and the tour in support of it were mediocre at best, we still praised Britney for a triumphant return. We let the fact that she hasn't been at her peak since 2004 slip out of importance ... but NOW, after the mediocre comeback, the stakes were higher than ever for Britney in 2011. I'll admit, I've been a fan since the 6th grade. Since the first time I saw her prance around in that school-girl outfit. I've loved Britney as a person, not as a performer, so i'm happy to see that in her personal affairs, she seems to be much, much happier this year. However, as a performer, she's slipped and fallen .... HARD.   'Femme Fatale' is actually some of Britney's finest work, despite the fact that she had absolutely nothing to do with it. 'The Femme Fatale Tour' is a much needed burst of improvement since 2008 as well, though unfortunately, she's still missing the mark.   This tour and DVD are a whole ton of fun. Flirty outfits, great back-up dancers, sexy choreography, and great music .... the only bummer is that the WEAKEST part of this show, is Britney herself. Britney manages to improve upon her 2008 Circus Tour by actually conversing with the audience this time around, which let's face it, she barely did at all the last time around. The bummer here is that she's still not putting much effort into the dancing, and the lip-syncing is just getting more and more embarrassing. In a world where Lady GaGa and Adele are both live singers, and selling out shows, the stakes are high, and Britney is missing the mark.   Songs like 'I'm a Slave 4 U','Toxic', 'Baby One More Time', and 'Till The World Ends' are all great hits ... and frankly, the fact that she lip-syncs them doesn't even offend me. It's the fact that thelive tracks for some of these songs are literally ripped right off of the album, and are obviously fake. See most pop stars obviously use a live backing track, the thing is those pop-stars at least take the time to pre-record those live vocals. The bummer with the 'Femme Fatale Tour', is that Britney didn't take that time at all. This show feels rushed, and not quite as well plotted out as it could be.   The DVD itself is a total let-down unfortunately because it doesn't have any kind of behind-the-scenes work at all. The fact is though, you're only paying $13.99 for it. If you want all the extras, look at the Blu Ray, which features interviews, rehearsal footage, music videos and more.   Britney is a great burst of energy on stage, and she's always been fun to watch. Plus, make no mistake, this show had the potential to be one of her greatest ever. If you can get passed the obvious lip-synching and not so impressive choreography, then you might just see that fact.   Pros: Great Costumes, Energetic back-up dancers, fantastic show lighting, and theme.  Weakest Link: Britney miming every single song.
B005VPRET4|5.0|This is a very good set and has very many details.I would not expect someone who is not very experienced with lego building to be able to build this by themselves because the stickers/decals can be difficult to put on and the roof can be difficult to snap onto the rest of the structure. over all this is a nice set and it is nice to see sets that are more appealing to girls and don't worry regurlar minifigures fit fine in the cafe.

Cut the Rope is a very addicting game that keeps me busy for a good half an hour. And even if it isn't as updated and what not, it is still a great game with levels I could play over and over.
B00378OBJ8|5.0|I purchased the \\"Under Great White Northern Lights\\" (Limited Edition Box Set as a Christmas gift for my son (Believe me, I would not have purchased it for myself!).  He was particularly happy that the box set included the tour DVD.  He thought it was the perfect gift-something so expensive he would have never bought it for himself and something he'll be able to enjoy as for long as he wants.  I'm particularly happy that he no longer lives at home!

B005I6EU48|5.0|I wish this was on a earlier Amazon  page for Kindle Fire people to see it for sale as it took me some hunting on Amazon to find it. I have only gotten Ohhs and ahhhs from friends who have seen it. It does what the discription says it will do, and holds the Kindle Fire perfectly. It looks like a million bucks and closes nicely.   I would have liked to have had a brass lock closing option on it like a diary, or even a custom embossing option for a personalized name. This is a beautiful cover and I  would not change it for any of the other covers I have seen so far.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Fun game until it shuts down before finishing every time so far. Played on Verizon Droid 2. I thought It must have a timer that kicks you out but it does not!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Often irresponsive and wants to make several choices for you. Not very practical. The concept is good but very bad implementation

B004ECDNJU|5.0|This was actually a very good, fun little game! Judging by the reviews I thought it might suck, but it just goes to show the level of intelligence &amp; competence on here. (&amp; I'm not talking about superman75, either. Keep on trolling as far as I'm concerned! You're funny &amp; entertaining, &amp; a good break from the moronic ranting that's usually on here.)<br /><br />This game is definitely not just a remake of  one of the same old crap games circulating on the android market. It's something new that's hard enough to make it a challenge, but not so hard that it's not enjoyable. For a casual game I like it, &amp; if I cared to play casual games I'd definitely keep it around.<br /><br />Game play goes something like this:  There are several things that look like pots...some that have colors on them, &amp; some that have arrows. Each pot has openings on a couple different sides. A dragon breathes colored fire towards one of the pots with an arrow on it. You have to direct the colored fire to the same colored pot by pointing the arrows in the correct direction. It will go in one opening &amp; out the other to the next pot you're aimed at. Once the colored fire gets into its colored pot, the pot will close &amp; is done. The aim is to close them all without getting wrong colors into the wrong pots. Depending on what level you're on, there can be a lot of arrows &amp; once you get one color into its pot, it changes color several times before it's done &amp; closes. The game progresses quickly, but isn't as hard as it first looks. It does get quite challenging afterwhile, though, which is always good.<br /><br />Overall, definitely a good game for any casual gamer. Anyone with any intelligence won't be disappointed!
0545091020|5.0|Everyone keeps talking about how wonderful this book is, so I decided to give it a try.  It is a fantastic.... everyone is right!  lol  In fact, I couldn't put it down the first night,  and I ended up reading the first THIRD of the book in one night!  (It's a super easy read, and so engaging!)  I kept thinking how thankful I am to be born in the USA where we are FREE.... let us never take our freedom for granted, ladies and gentlemen!

B004XD03RK|5.0|Death is a band that built a considerable reputation among metal fans. They are credited for creating both Death Metal and Technical Death metal, the former being the most loved genre in underground metal. Their best work is Human, an album which marks a considerable stylish change for the band, incorporating progressive metal elements to their music, making the sound ever better than it was! With a super-group recruited for recording the album, Chuck Schuldiner, the \\"Father of Death Metal\\", really made history with 'Human'. A real \\"must-have\\" album!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book in 1 day.  I thought it was a great story line, it was hard to put the book down at times because you didn't know where the relationship was going to go from one chapter to the next.  The story ended very good, I would even read a sequel if the author wrote one.  Not to mention the great .99 kindle price on this book.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Loved the movie in the theater, but the extended version really adds some nice back story. It also fills out more of the present story, and a final scene towards the end caps it off even better. Great packaging too! A true collectors edition and worth every penny extra.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought Perplexus Epic for my 13 year old son for Christmas but it is my 15 year old daughter and her friends that have been playing with it for almost 2 days straight.  They are determined to beat the challenge...even going as far as watching videos on youtube for help.  I was a little nervous about pieces breaking off because of reviews that I read before purchasing but we haven't had any issues.  I also want to add that a friend of mine, a 4th grade teacher, bought 2 different Perplexus' for her classroom and they are a big hit. Both are still in perfect shape with no broken pieces.

B001Q2RXJC|5.0|One of the fathers of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Saxon has always been one of the top names when it comes to bands \\"without one best album\\". There's a Saxon album for each kind of metal fan. If you enjoy some hard/heavy similar to Scorpions, try mixing Scorpions' \\"Pictured Life\\" and Iron Maiden's \\"Aces High\\" or \\"The Wicker Man\\". The result is Wheels of Steel, one of the masterpieces of traditional Heavy Metal, in the old British style. Excellent album!

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I have been watching this movie for many times, but since they have the definitive edition than i bought it and saw this movie again. My wife and I really love this movie. This movie shows how Jesus died for you and me. I think this is the most close movie version compare to Bible.   I know this movie contains the brutality of Roman soldier but since it was true, I think that is okay.  I really recommend this movie to everybody.
B005CW5E3E|4.0|Johnny Winter scores with his latest CD offering by playing the songs that influenced his long and very fine career. With the help of contempory blues artists. Johnny propels the listener down memory lane in a Rocket 88. His playing is superb and his voice still holds up on these selections. A good addition to your CD library.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works offline without wifi, you just have to download whichever version you wish to read. I downloaded every version because-well why not?-and I do not have any problems switching between them.  If you do have a legitimate complaint with it, leave your android device information before submitting. Otherwise, how do you expect the developers to ever fix the problem?  While I do find it a bit odd that you cannot disable this app, if you are that paranoid about people collecting your information, you probably shouldn't own a smartphone, and may want to consider wearing a tinfoil hat. Seriously, I worry about programs monitoring and acquiring my information, but I will at least not jump to wild conclusions based on what could just be a glitch and call something &quot;malware.&quot; Offer some proof instead of speculation.  Some people's kids.
B000003CMC|5.0|The last album that the band made with their main slide guitar player, Duane Allman, the Skydog, was their best. The perfect goodbye for a guitar player like Duane, who records his last song \\"Little Martha\\", one of the most beautiful melodies ever produced in all rock music. Blues, Country, Rock, some Jazz (in \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\"), you'll find it all in this album. The band plays some old blues songs, but that doesn't mean they are bad. In fact, most of those versions are better than the original ones. If you like good classic rock, listen to this album, a true masterpiece from the south of USA. Recommended!

1603425381|4.0|I purchased this book just to qualify for the free shipping but I also got it as I was tired of making crochet projects that had blah edging. Now I am still quite a beginner when it comes to crochet and knitting with just a year under my belt but I know I want to make nice projects that have pretty edging as well.  A quick, then much longer look through this book makes me salivate for more blanket projects!  Alas, the one major downside to this book and many other crochet, knitting, weaving, spinning books are they are very limited in sturdy spiral bounding.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Fantasy fans and GRRM groupies, I am going to rain on this parade a teensy bit.  My overall thesis here is that GRRM lost track of where this story needed to go. I understand it was written over a fairly long period with substantial intervals between books. Perhaps that has something to do with this problem.  First the good stuff. GRRM has created a very compelling, believable universe in this series. He is also a master at character development and filling in what I will call the matrix of the story. That is providing lots of details and vignettes that help us to know and care about the characters with which he has peopled the story. Thats about it folks.  After the first book (GoT) in which the framework and over-arching story lines are introduced (which I am ready to acknowledge as a masterwork on a par with \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" in the LOTR series)the story sags to the point it is forgotten over the next 4 books. We lose nearly all of the original set of characters the first book introduced us to, either to death or some endless quest to rejoin a family that some do not realize, no longer exists. We meet numerous new characters who contribute virtually nothing to the Framework of the story and dissapear. We meet so many characters (some who have little or no relationship to previous characters) that it is difficult to remember what more important, potentially pivotal characters were doing hundreds of pages previously.  It is not my intention to write a \\"War and Peace\\" review here. Let me close with some bullets that are areas of key dissappointment for me in this series.  1. Arya, far and away the most interesting character in this series. GRRM cheats us out of an outstanding heroine. His development of her story in Braavos is terrific. The dissapppointment is that it goes nowhere and contributes nothing to the story. Everyone expects that there will be a reunion with Syrio here. It doesnt happen. It ends as an isolated vignette. Hopefully in some futurework he redeems this travesty.   2. Winter is Coming, Winter is coming... we hear this endlessly. So what? There is virtually no consistent development of this theme.  3. \\"The Others\\" A powerful creation and story line driver that is neglected to the point of it being a distraction.  4. The Wall. We end with some ambivalence as to the true purpose of the wall and its guardians. This is a Framework mainstay and its treatment toward the close dilutes the story.  I could go on and may if this review generates any feedback.
0142418471|5.0|It was finally winter break, which means I was finally able to read all the books that had been piling up in my room. One of these? Will Grayson Will Grayson.   Now me, I'm a bit biased, being a massive John Green fan. But I digress. This book tells the story of two teenagers, both named Will Grayson, who meet up one cold, Chicago night in an, how shall I put this since my teacher is going to read this, adult book store. However, both Will Graysons have unique personalities and life stories, making it all the more amazing how quickly their lives intertwine.  I loved John Green's Will Grayson. He was sarcastic, quirky, relatable and someone I could see myself being friends with. Watching his relationship with Jane blossom from the awkward first steps to the introduction of Jane to Will's father just felt so natural and real. But most of all? I loved his friendship with Tiny Cooper. Tiny Cooper, \\"the world's largest person who is also really, really gay\\" might just be one of my favorite literary characters ever.   David Levithan's Will Grayson might not have been my favorite, but he was quite interesting to read about. It was quite strange to read chapters in all lower case letters at first - my inner grammar nerd was freaking out a bit. But as it kept going, I realized it added so nicely to Will's character. I also loved Levithan's portrayal of Will's depression. It showed what happens what happens actually living with depression. Most books show trying to get over it, not what living with it every day is like. And though he has this hard exterior, I'm glad Levithan gave him a soft center.  Overall, a wonderful read for anyone 13-14+. Its a fast-paced, hilarious ride that not only makes you laugh but makes you appreciate the friends and relationships you have. It also makes you want to create your own musical about the life of a gay man. But that's for another day.

1594202710|5.0|Kissinger starts out by reviewing Chinese history from ancient to modern times to show how that long history has molded their thinking.  Then he goes on to demonstrate how time and again the Chinese have viewed our policy of deterrence as encirclement and aggression.  And this difference in perception continues to be a problem today. The professor, however, ends by expressing his opinion that even though the Chinese threat is indeed inherent in their rapidly increasing capabilities (peaceful intentions can change) a military clash between the USA and China is not necessarily inevitable.

0449011178|1.0|This is really one of the worst books dealing with Pemberly after Elizabeth's marriage. It is incredibly boring - the reader is excellent though but that does not make up for the poor plot and tedious details. I had expected better from P.D. James but this was not it. The characters are very one dimensional and the murder is quickly solved and there is little suspense to the book. The amount of detail about country life simply does not ring true of Jane Austen;s detail and instead of being delighted we are bored. There is relatively little action and conversation is stilted and unnatural.  If you loved Pride and Prejudice then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. There are other mysteries out featuring Elizabeth and Darcy which are must better done.  Please note this review is based on the audio version - but I doubt if reading it would change my opinion, although it would make it easier to skip over the incredibly boring chunks of which there are too many.

0345528581|5.0|I've been following the program in this book for 2 months now. Previous to this purchase I had been doing sprint interval training. I was looking for a bodyweight program I could follow during the winter months. I've been very impressed with the gains I've made over the last 2 months. My legs, arms, and chest are noticeably bigger and my abs are much stronger.  The book is fairly well written and contains a lot of information about general fitness principles. I have recommended the book to many of my family members. My nephew is currently doing the program with me and my parents (in their late 50's) are also doing the program and are enjoying it.
B004EPYZT4|3.0|Robert E. Howard's Conan is refreshed but does it compare to the other Conan with Arnie? Well, this gets some things right. For instance, I think the actor portraying this Conan is truer to the books and hands down this version gets the era and costumes of the Hyborian Age correct. Conan's relationship with his father has more depth and the special effects, of course, are better than the older movie but that's no surprise. That said, the villain of the old one was a lot better, so was the love interest and the overall story and flow is better, too. Oh, and the music score of the old Conan is better as well. See Rose McGowan play a psycho in the new one. This film cost a bit about $90M to make but only yielded a tad over $48M at the Box Office. I guess Arnie still holds the title as his picture was about $20M and made over $100M worldwide. STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C to C plus; SPECIAL EFFECTS/LOCATION: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED mid December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B minus;
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody are wasted talent in this poorly written wanna-be gilded age narrative. I find his stereotypical New York and Parisian personalities Art History 101 personas. His pseudo intellectual stock casts are boring and patronizing. This film is the definition of a wanna-be history buff attempting to reach an uneducated public who fantasize that Paris is the city of midnight with champagne flowing and scripted philosophy dripping from all martini glasses. How patronizing.  Just a few details that need substance are:  The constant binary between Paris and Los Angeles (Malibu this time).   The stereotyped programmatic characters  The music sounding more Spanish guitar than French.  The dumfus protagonist that can't be taken seriously.  The simple script, Hemingway's, a \\"bathtub gin writer\\" states \\"I'm working on a novel\\"   Scott Fitzgerald, introducing his poorly acted drunken wife, Zelda...who states, \\"my talent lies in drinking\\".  What kind of books do you write? states Scott Fitzgerald character,   \\"We are all bored\\"....that goes for the audience as well.  Nobody questions 21st c clothes in early Paris?  The actor who plays Hemingway \\"it was unfulfilled\\" is unfullfilled as an actor. Terrible performance or directing?  The sets are dusty and sepia toned....costumes are stereotyped as well.   The whole sensibilty ...horse carriages ...smoking..... study of Coco Chanel....  Really? Did you miss adding any well-known artist? You compressed the greats inot sound-bytes that made each look idiotic including TS Elliott and his (pal?) Man Ray.  You achieved a Paris Salon without substance.  Now Woody, take a course in Substance and give us a film that has some depth.   How do you say \\"trash\\" in French?  M. McFaull

B0050SYS5A|5.0|You do have to spend some time re-calibrating and setting up the kinect with the zoom on it. Once you have it set change the settings so that your preferences don't change (after each game the kinect will automatically reset) then it works perfect! I have a small living room where the furthest back I can step is just under 6 feet. I've had it for a few days and tried it with a lot of different games, I didn't have to reset it after the initial set-up.

076115678X|5.0|I starting reading this book about a week ago and now I'm in love with my curls.  I've never been one to straighten my hair or battle against my curls. But I still suffered with dry frizzy hair. Most days I would wear my hair tied back, if I did wear it down it would look nice for an hour or 2 and then frizz.<br /><br />My whole family have curly hair and I 'thought' I understood it. I just didn't feel I had the time or money to look after it right - I was wrong!!<br /><br />It's super easy to do. You can use cheap grocery store brands (I use Tresemme Naturals Conditioner) - just remember to read the ingredients!  It takes me about 5 mins to wash/style my shoulder length hair now. And my hair has never looked better - and it's only been a week!<br /><br />This book also has a section on kids hair. I now know how to look after my daughter's curly hair, so no more tears and tantrums in the mornings! Bliss!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone with curly or wavy hair.

B005K2XUPK|5.0|My wife and I each have a Timbuk2 for our Kindles and we love them.  They are a pretty simple design, but really fit the Kindle well.  They are a perfect cover for the Kindle.  I also purchased a Timbuk2 sleeve for my Kindle Fire.  I was a little skeptical that the sleeve would fit on the larger Fire.  Well, fear not.  They must have expanded the sleeve slightly because the new one fits the Fire like a glove, not too loose and not to tight.  It's easy to put the Fire into the sleeve and take it out.  Great product.  Get the 'red' (and gray and black) one for your Fire because it is the nicest looking and appropriate for the 'Fire'.

B0056BU3I2|2.0|The movie itself is great. I'm a big fan of Fast and Furious movies... For this item (both theatrical and extended versions), I noticed that at one part of the movie (where Dom & Bryan are having conversation that they will do the final job and disappear forever), the film stopped at the part of Dom's line \\"...forever\\" with no sound and continued again.:-(( I watched this in the big screen and didn't notice that.
B000JLSM00|5.0|***UPDATE BELOW - Product is now 5 Stars***  \\"The Searchers\\" is one of my favorite movies and, I'm confident, one of the greatest American films of all time.  The video on this blu ray disc is absolutely stunning!  Watching this movie on anything other than a 1080p large screen TV should be outlawed - Monument Valley never looked so good!  It's as big as all outdoors!  I could watch them ride around in the dust for days.  -HOWEVER-  The audio on this Blu Ray lags behind the video by a split second.  It's consistent all throughout the entire movie.  This absolutely ruins the entire experience for me.  I do not have any problems with any of the audio on any of the other Blu Rays that I have played on my system (Oppo BDP-93 going directly into a Mistubishi WD-73840), so I don't buy the argument that it is my system's fault.  Just in case, though, I have tried watching this disc with just about every conceivable configuration between both the TV and the Blu Ray player.  I've searched the Internet and found several folks who have had the same problem, but other folks who swear that there's nothing wrong with the audio.  So what's the deal?  Is there a batch of defective discs out there and I just happened to get one of the bad ones?  Does Warner Brothers offer replacement discs (they've yet to respond to my query)?  The one fact I have is that the audio is not synced on my disc.  The one thing I'd like to know is what to do about it.  It's a shame, too.  Even with the Oppo's super-upscaling powers, my plain old DVD copy can't hold a candle to the gorgeous picture of the Blu Ray (even though the audio works perfectly on the DVD).  ** UPDATE **  I took the disc to the local Big Screen Store, and the audio lag showed up on their system, too.  So I returned the disc to Amazon for a replacement.  Just tested it out and, alas, the audio lag is on the replacement, too.  So I looked a little harder, and I've noticed that in some scenes, the audio is perfectly matched.  But in other scenes the lag is there and very obvious.  For example, the scene when Ward Bond first shows up to get the posse together to go after Jorgenson's stolen cattle, the lag is very obvious.  You can see it especially when John Wayne makes his entrance - he has such a distinct and slow way of speaking, just watch when he says \\"Didn't turn it into no plowshare, neither.\\"  The \\"P\\" in plowshare you can clearly see his mouth move before you hear it.  I watched the exact same scene on the DVD and it's clear that the blu-ray is lagging.  You can also tell it when the kids are teasing Lucy about hugging Brad (Dobe Carey) - when she yells at them she's way out-of-sync.  You can also see it in the sound effects - the cups are put on the table a split second before you hear them - the door is shut and then you hear the sound.  In other scenes, like when they're in the tent with Chief Scar, the audio matched up perfectly as far as I could tell.  While this is disappointing for me, this being one of my favorite movies, I can't not recommend this blu-ray.  Since the sync issue is only intermittent and, apparently, not noticed by many, I can't imagine Warner Brothers issuing any sort of correction.  And the movie looks so much better on this blu-ray that it's really not an option to avoid it.  *** ANOTHER UPDATE ***  I contacted Warner Brothers through their website to report this audio-sync issue on \\"The Searchers.\\"  To my great surprise, they contacted me back and offered to replace the disc.  I explained that I had already replaced it once through Amazon & found the same problem, and they said that it was possible that Amazon may have received a bad batch of discs.  I figured I had nothing to lose, so they sent me a FedEx mailing label, I sent it off, and about three weeks later I received the replacement disc.  And HUZZAH!  Everyone is in perfect sync!  There are NO AUDIO ISSUES at all with the copy I now have!  I watched very carefully, even going back & forth over specific trouble spots I noted above, and no problems!  Plus it still looks gorgeous!  So there may be a few bad discs out there, and you may wind up with one - but fear not, Warner Brothers will fix it for you and it won't cost a dime.  So 5 stars for The Searchers Blu-Ray and 5 stars for Warner Brothers customer service!
030788743X|4.0|This book is very enjoyable, particularly for someone familiar enough with late 20th-century pop culture to get at least fifty percent of the references. Cline is clearly as obsessively knowledgeable in minutiae as his protagonist Wade Watts, but without Wade's excuse of inheriting a billionaire's fortune if he proves himself more a more knowledgeable nerd than all the rest.  The book starts out describing the mess the world has fallen into by 2044--massive energy crisis, trashed environment, and most of the world is unemployed and living in slums. The only escape is the massive online videogame OASIS, into which most of the world has retreated to escape how truly awful life in the real world is. The twist--control of OASIS has been up for grabs since the death of its creator, who built a contest into the enormous videogame based in the 80s nerd culture he loved. Whoever emerges victorious wins complete control not only over OASIS but also the company in the outside world that runs it. The book drags a little until all of this is carefully explained and we have had a thorough introduction to Wade.  The action picks up when Wade stumbles upon the first key to the prize after five years of searching. Suddenly everyone in the world is after him and he has no idea who he can trust. The rest of the book is nonstop action and intrigue. It's a lot of fun, and feels like one of the 80s action movies so often referenced, right down to the climactic good vs. evil battle at the end. A little simplistic, but it works well given that the whole book is an homage to exactly this type of story so often told in movies and videogames. It even manages to get in some more subtle messages, like the importance of face-to-face relationships in a world where most people's entire social lives are virtual.  My biggest complaint about this book is that there is a little too much direct exposition. Some of it, like explaining how OASIS functions, is necessary to understand the story. Some of it, like Wade's rant against religion at the beginning of the story, is pointless and enhances neither story nor character nor environment. Also, the bad guy is the standard soulless corporate monster that has become the villain du jour, like the Nazis in 30s and 40s period pieces and the Reds for the Cold War. I would have liked some more depth to his character.  So in conclusion, I recommend this book if you can look past the slow beginning and the sometimes-worthless exposition. The concept is novel (though the frame of the-world-has-gone-to-hell-in-the-not-so-distant-future isn't), the references are entertaining, the plot is exciting once it gets started, and the characters are complex enough not to feel contrived (except for the bad guy).
B005ZUR724|3.0|I bought this app Xmas morning when I opened my new kindle. After the let down with the update not being available I thought today would be different. I read that I needed to re install so I delete the file, now it says error trying to download. wth!!! I wont knock the rating with 1 star because obviously a lot of you say its great so I'm patiently waiting but seriously fix this please...
B006INDMEE|1.0|I am so glad I missed this movie when it was in the theatre because it has got to be one of the most implausible stories I have ever seen. Unbelievable plot, tedious moral dilemma, silly script, and without an ounce of suspense anywhere it was hardly even worth the 3.99 streaming rental. The acting is good enough, but otherwise what a complete waste.

1451627289|5.0|Great story telling as usual. I am thankful King hasnt lost the ability to knit a new thread of existence with his storytelling. Sometimes I even wonder if he isnt just looking through some glass at alternate realities and writes what he observes. I am not a history nut at all, and general things that tend towards the nonfiction bore me, but this novel kept me reading long past when i called it a night.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|My kids really enjoyed the original Perplexis so we decided to get them the Epic for Christmas. It was a lot of fun, but as they continued through the maze, they noticed a screw was not connected and made the staircase wiggley. This defect made it impossible for them to get past #66 in the maze. So, I figured I'd have it replaced through Amazon (which is where we purchased it from). Having read the reviews prior to buying, I knew there could be a possibility of a defect. One person had to return it 3 times before getting a quality ball. But when I went to send it back, it surprisingly didn't give 'replacement' as an option. When I scrolled over the \\"why\\" it said 'this item not in stock'.  Funny... I opened up another window in Amazon and there it was, available w/ Super Saver Shipping! Hmmmm.... I'll just take the credit and find it at our local game store. Sure, it may be a few dollars more, but at least I don't have to pay return shipping several times to get a defect-free product. I'm not totally upset... I just don't want to go through the hassle.
1401216676|5.0|The Killing Joke by Alan Moore, written in 1988  Very dark, a lot of depth and well structured. So much thought was put into it and its more about the capacity of one bad day to either ruin a persons life or to convict them to change their life forever.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|UPDATE: In addition, after I deleted the app from my device and left it in the cloud, it left behind a hidden folder on my SD card. I had to manually remove it with a third party application. Honestly, this is worth a star demerit but I don't hate Evernote.  Pros: I enjoyed typing my notes directly into the Kindle Fire (KF) app, like using a simple word processor. I like that Evernote synched my KF to an insecure web server, to my desktop, and to a web interface. It was an easy way to transfer image and text files.  Cons: It was hard to cut and paste text on the Kindle Fire (KF). What I did instead was create multiple notes that I was going to patch together later on a desktop. That is, until I lost one my biggest notes. Now my heart is crying. I'm not sure how much of the sync error is due to Evernote or Kindle Fire's memory, but regardless, the two apps combined makes me wince.  Verdict: I just deleted the app.  If you're going to use Evernote: Make sure to have a back up version in another app!

0321146530|2.0|Based on the many glowing reviews of this book as well as the status of the author in regards to TDD, I purchased it expecting an actionable introduction to the style. So I'm surprised to find it's not only unusable for such purpose, but bad enough that I'm compelled to document the reasons here.<br /><br />In particular, a lack of a complete, working summary of the code developed in the examples. Beck continually revises a single function (the test assertions) over the course of the first example (seventeen chapters), but nowhere presents a final, authoritative version. As well, Beck fails to mention the possibility that the tests could suffer from the same incorrect assumptions as the target code.<br /><br />Beyond any specific deficiencies, Beck's particular style of iterative development leaves me questioning the value of the methodology toward building reliable and robust systems. Continually revising the test framework -- allowing for amendment or culling at any moment -- allows for tests that are manipulated until they pass whatever happens to compile at a given moment. This might be admissible in a team environment, but by itself, can't be more reliable than other approaches. And the singular focus of this book does nothing to explain the importance of using TDD within a larger development approach (one which probably includes revision control, pair-programming, and UX testing, say).<br /><br />I truly hope that I'm wrong in my assessment, that I've missed a deeper lesson hidden within the text. I assume that I'm ignorant enough of the field to be unqualified to judge Beck's contributions. But when I came back here and read some of the longer, critical reviews, I found a lot of these same concerns already well noted. With no disrespect to the author, the book does little to help me learn TDD. It does not give a complete, clear path, despite being 'by example'. I would welcome any references to actionable expositions of TDD.
1439102724|4.0|I can't think of a better way to summarize this book as Picoult brings together many controversial -- or at the very least deeply emotional/hotly debated topics: IVF, alternative therapies, gay rights, Evangelical Christianity, suicidal adolescents.  Deep issues all, but the novel blends them togethter like sugar-free ice cream - satisfying, but something's missing in the texture.  Zoe is an ambitious, dedicated music therapist who has had successful in-vitro treatments to achieve pregnancy, but in the world of IVF \\"successful\\" can mean just that: achieving a pregnancy, not necessarily bringing one to a viable birth. Sing You Home explores the emotional landmines that can follow such a process, the toll it takes on the woman, her partner, family, friends and co-workers. In various ways, it can impact interactions with all people with whom one comes in contact. In this regard, Picoult tells her tale well, effectively and accurately.  **WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS, PLOT OUTLINE AND DEVELOPMENT***  From a medical standpoint, I can appreciate the depth of knowledge Picoult has for assisted reproductive technology. She uses the correct terminology, facts of a fresh and frozen cycles of in-vitro quite accurately. That is, to a point - I found myself questioning what this \\"male pattern infertility\\" brothers Max (Zoe's husband as we're first introduced to him) and Reid share. There's no elaboration of what this deficiency is, nor why a pregnancy may be achieved but not carried - is it a genetic defect? If so, why have they not used pre-implantation diagnostics? And if Zoe and Max, paupers by the standards of wealth Max's brother Reid has attained, why hasn't Reid and his wife Liddy gone the IVF route themselves? It didn't ring true.   Also, it strains credibility that Zoe would have all the ailments she has - from polycystic ovarian syndrome to habitual aborter to preterm labor (how utterly contrived - to go into labor at the precise time of one's baby shower, 12 weeks before the scheduled due date no less), to a relatively rare placental condition, to a bleeding disorder to a serious uterine malady. Even simply writing that now - practically incredible.   I read a good sampling of reviewers here who criticized Picoult's depiction of Evangelical Christians, but honestly - the same could be said of her synopsis of Zoe's medical condition - it strains credibility. Could it happen? Sure, but in extreme cases. And there are some Evangelicals who may in some situations act in exterme ways. Therefore neither of those aspects bothered me tremendously in reading the book - when one reads a work of fiction, especially \\"pop fiction\\" which is the genre in which I'd categorize this type of book, one needs to suspend disbelief to a degree and succumb to poetic license.   I'm sure attorneys would likely be impressed at Picoult's knowledge of jurisprudence - again, to a degree. Would a trial get as far as Zoe's had without either party's attorney questioning the reproductive doctor and reviwing her files before she took the stand?  Again, highly doubtful.  The issue of sexual preference - I felt that the author did a satisfactory job of explaining the emotional turmoil and gradual acceptance of the main characters involved in coming to terms with their attractions and/or their grappling over them.  Was there great character depth and development?  Like other aspects of the book, I felt there were gaps here, too, but generally effectively done for the plot line. There were certainly some stereotypes - new age notwithstanding - but it made for comedic relief if nothing else.  Overall, I found Sing You Home to be a good basic read. It kept my interest, it caused me to think about some very real contemporary issues. Great literature it's not, but light-fare prompting reflection on some controversial societal issues of where we stand in regard to some complex modern day issues. To me, it was entertaining and thought-provoking and that it is all I wanted to get out of this book.   Like a quick dessert - it may not have been a rich chocolate ice cream but it was a satisfying light frozen yogurt all the same.

0439023491|5.0|I read this book the day after the first Hunger Games. It took me in a direction I did not see coming plot-wise and had me hooked from then on. I could almost picture President Snow as he spoke with Katniss face to face and the dilemma he faced on how to deal with her. It set the tone for her hatred of him and what he represented to her and her fellow citizens. I am intrigued to see where her character goes in the third book. This is a great series, especially for someone like me who is not an avid reader.

B003WJQ74E|5.0|Must read this book.  There is so much to like in this book.     The first thing that makes this book so great is the writing changes as Charlie gets smarter.  I think this is the one book that really needs to be read in book form and not on Kindle (due to Charlie's writing being so bad at first).  My wife is going to read it and does not read on Kindle so I will see from her copy if there is any difference.        The 2nd part of the book that I really liked was the view you get from Charlie about being bullied AND the view of those being bullied.  It really makes you think about the effects of bullying as well as the motivation of those doing the bullying.      Other things about this book are the relation with Charlie's family and their importance in his life.  The family aspect is one of the hardest to read.  With all the pain that Charlie faces from the world it is hard to imagine that his family would add to that.    Charlie's social interraction, or desire for it, is one of th book's strong points.  The author does such a great job of conveying Charlie's loneliness, as well as his other emotions.      I love reading a book that sticks with you.  Even after you put it down.  This one certainly does that.  I may have to read it again later on (not something I ever do).  Flowers for Algernon is a touching, read that is endearing and heartbreaking at the same time.
0439023521|5.0|This was the first book book I have ever read cover to cover in one evening. I saw the previews of the upcoming movie and my wife suggested that I read the book first. The concept of the story was hard to believe at first until you think about the brutality of many current and past leaders of countries and then you can imagine people killing each other for \\"sport\\" as entertainment for those brutal leaders is realistic. The bravery of Katniss to take her younger sister's spot in the games begins the intrigue of this book and the remainder of the book keeps you wanting to go on reading. As I knew I was approaching the end, I had a feeling on how the book would end and it pretty much played out that way, which sets up nicely for book 2; which I read the next night! I now look forward to the film version.
B006O5Y0SS|2.0|What an amateur written, boring movie even for such a mediocre director as Allen. The only entertaining scene (lunch with parents) is in the trailer, the rest is a digest of cliches reminiscent of a high school play. I wonder if Allen fans ever seen movies by the really talented American directors like Robert Altman and Todd Solondz? Allen's iconic status with intellectuals is puzzling.

0143119680|2.0|I thought it would be worth my time given the fact that Amazon coded it as a \\"best of the month.\\" As an English teacher, reading for pleasure comes rarely when I spend all my time grading. This was just awful for me, but I can understand that some might enjoy the romance that seems to be unfolding. However, for those looking for a good fantasy, this is not it. Let's just say that I couldn't take it anymore when the author spends ten pages describing how a vampire and the main character, a witch, go to a yoga class. By the way, nothing else has happened of any importance in any way for these 100 pages. I know that 100 pages isn't much of a review, but time can be precious.... Unless you like the Twilight series (yuck), look elsewhere than this book for a good read.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a lovely lush series with production values more like Brideshead than Upstairs, and is thoroughly enjoyable.  It seems more accurately to be  a 20's and 30's  era  drama in its characters, other than the dowager countess, who have the buffer look and attitudes of the 20's rather than the historically accurate depiction of the Edwardian age.  The servants of this Earl  seem unrealistically to have very personal relationships with the family.  I do believe that the relationship was much more formal and distant, like most employee-employer relationships today.  However it is a lovely series with a performance by Maggie Smith as much a jewel as Gielgud's  in Brideshead. It would be good if PBS made a short film exploring the actual servant-master relationship during the Edwardian period as a companion piece, but this might be a hard sell.  But, regardless, Hoorah for PBS.

140053271X|4.0|I received this as a christmas present. I will admit that when opening I was somewhat disappointed with the ereader I got (yes, I did want an ereader though). Because I had actually asked for the kindle touch, but I soon became happy with the NST. Here is my thought process...  *Even though the Kindle has text to speech (and not NST), people online pointed out that it seemed very robotic, which would make me not want to use that feature.  *The Kindle DOES have audiobooks (unlike the NST) but most audio books are about 30 hours, and I would rather read than sit for that time.  *The Kindle also has a web browser, but an e-ink display is not really ment for internet use, making it slow and laggy. Thus it is not really a advantage.  *Barnes & Noble actually has stores to go and ask questions  *On the nook, you can change the wallpaper/screensaver.  *You can do that ^ on the kindle but you have to hack it first.  Although I do think that the Kindle IS a better device, it a lot more expensive if you want no ads. I just would like you to remember that this is my thought process and everyone has their own opinion. I HAVE been using the nook a lot and I think it is a great device to.   ONE FINAL THING: I have noticed that I have only used my nook for a week and it is already low on battery (the battery life is supposed to be 2 months). Given... I have used it nonstop so I can understand why. That is why I gave 5, not 4...  just wanted to point that out.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|I've had this player for a year now and I'm not totally unsatisfied with the purchase, considering the low price as well as this model being my first turntable.  Occasionally the tone arm decides that it doesn't want to play the record when I press start and returns to the default position immediately after hitting the lead-in groove.  The ceramic cartridge is non-replaceable, and when it's time for you to replace the stylus and/or the drive belt, you will get no help from Sony.  A few weeks ago I noticed that all my records seemed to be playing slightly too slow and the issue was a worn out belt drive.  I guess the stock belt in this machine is super cheapo because I've only got about 100 hours out of this machine... if you go to [...] you can buy replacement styluses and belts for any turntable.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|First off, I don't care about who she supports politically, because I know Kelly Clarkson is NOT racist or a homophobe (and I'm not convinced RP is either), but all politics aside, this album is a materpiece in its own right.     Stronger has a lot of wonderful uptempo empowering anthems such as What Doestn't Kill You (Stronger), and some great mid tempo tell off songs like Mr. Know it All and You Love Me. It also has a few beautiful and meaningful ballads like my personal faves, The War is Over, The Sun Will Rise, and Honestly. I have some personal and unexpected faves as well, such as Don't Be a Girl About It, while not exactly pc as it is somewhat sexist in it's message, but oh, so gloriously amusing and a real confection of vocal delight that needs to be savored like an ice cream sundae- but this album is so versatile, in it's entirety it is more like a banana split, and needs to be savored but devoured slowly.   Kelly Clarkson delivers like no other, whether she is hopeful (The Sun Will Rise/The War is Over), hopeless (You Can't Win), outraged (You Love Me, Let Me Down/Alone), determined (What Doest't Kill You/Stronger), fed up (Don't Be A Girl About It/Einstein) or just like all of us needing to be loved for who we are and not what everyone wants to mold us into (Honestly/Standing in Front of You/Hello).   I recommend the deluxe version, because the bonus tracks are standouts, and honestly, there are only a few songs that I occasionally skip (Einstein, Standing in Front of You), but it really depends on my mood, since this is an album for all moods, and there is at least a handful of songs on here, that pretty much, anyone can relate to. What I like about Kelly Clarkson, besides her vocals, is that while you could interpret her songs target any number of ways, it is not difficult to understand the meaning or the emotion behind them.   This is essentially a pop album (though it has a bit of country, rock, blues, and R&B influences on select songs), but not strictly with pop fluff, as the messages of empowerment and growth are universal and just important to our lives personally as laws and doctrines are important to politics. This is not a political album, but a wonderful and relatable personal album dealing with relationships and day to day issues, but as her songs have such versatility and she is especially good at anthems and kiss off songs, any one of these songs have potential to be adopted to transcend their original intended targets to have a greater meaning that could encompass an entire group or generation.   I don't encourage people to confuse the original target or intention of the song. Most of these were based on personal experiences, but most notably her verbal targets are either people she has worked with, or ex boyfriends (lately the former is her where she has her beef, since Kelly hasn't been dating in quite awhile). In a nutshell, just enjoy this highly relatable, and extremely fun to listen to album as it was originally intended. If you want to make some of these your personal anthems, well, that is the beauty and versatility of her straightforward lyrics!

B004EPYZT4|3.0|Even though I am a huge fan of the original (warts and all) I was still interested in seeing what could be done with a remake. The reviews kept me from going out and seeing it in the theaters but I am very happy I eventually rented it. There are a few missed opportunities to really make the characters shine such as delving more into the heroin and the prophecy she is part of as well as the relationship between the two main \\"evil\\" characters.<br /><br />But the gentleman playing conan does a very good job. There's action, sorcery, monsters and a really good nice sequence when conan is a boy.<br /><br />The very start of the movie is a bit over the top and silly. By this I mean, having the camera go \\"inside\\" the mother showing the baby sort of takes one out of the murky fantasy world we will be plummeted into. In addition the birth of conan seems more like B movie fair as it's quite over the top.<br /><br />Another missed opportunity is the thief sidekick who is not much of a side kick. He almost seems included in the movie as a plot device and we could have easily had more of him. If anything it would have added a lightness that would be very welcome. Instead he just exists so that he can be called upon later in the movie to do \\"one thing\\".<br /><br />However, in spite of this and in spite of the movie feeling like the end was rushed, I really liked it in a sort of B movie way and I recommend it to people who want a fun, well made (as far as production values) fantasy movie. I gave the movie three stars though my enjoyment was more like four stars because of the \\"fun factor\\". Still, when put under the microscope it is, to me, a three star movie at best. There are plot holes, characters are not fleshed out well enough, even for a Conan movie, And sometimes things don't flow well.<br /><br />If you are the type of person who is highly critical of these types of movies I would probably advise \\"moving along\\" as there wouldn't be anything to see here. If you like movies like Beast Master or \\"insert any low budget fantasy movie here\\" then you won't be disappointed with this.y movie here\\" then you won't be disappointed with this.

1451627289|4.0|Stephen King told an amazing story in Jake Epping's trip to the past, but like most mainstream media, he stuck to Warren Commission's findings of Oswald acting alone.  Even if Oswald was the only shooter in Dallas that day, there is no way that no one else new about what he was going to do.  As  someone who grew up  hunting using fire arms and seeing what happens to a bullet when it hits tissue or bone, the \\"magic bullet theory\\" is bull.....  And if you don't believe the  \\"magic bullet theory\\", then there had to be another shooter as the Zapruder film only allows for 3 shots in the alloted time.(That is if the Zapruder film is correct.)  I really thought King was going to have Jake stop Oswald but Kennedy would still be assasinated in Dallas.  So I give him credit for suprising me and sticking to his belief that there is a 98% chance Oswald acted alone.  I really enjoyed the early parts of the book when King describes how things were in 1958.  Still all around, great novel!

0060873027|4.0|It's been a while since I've picked up a novel by Michael Crichton. When our library put Micro by Crichton and Richard Preston into circulation, I grabbed a copy in order to try and catch up a bit. I was a bit surprised when I read the intro and found that Crichton had died and Preston took over to finish the novel. I think I probably heard or knew about his death at one point, but I certainly hadn't remembered.  So how does this Crichton/Preston novel fare? I'll be honest... to try and compare this to prior Crichton novels would be nearly impossible for me due to the large gap in time between when I last read one of his works and now. I have to go on the merits of Micro on its own. In that light, this was an OK read that would have been nice to have as a vacation book. It's not unforgettable, but it's not horrible, either.<br /><br />A group of engineering students from Cambridge are approached about coming to work for Nanigen, a hot start-up in Hawaii working in the microbiology field.  One of the students, Peter Jansen, is the brother of one of the principles, and that's enough to get the students to fly out (courtesy of the company) to see first-hand what Nanigen is doing.  But when Jansen's brother dies in a boating accident prior to the trip, Peter starts digging into the incident, as something seems off. Vin Drake, the CEO of Nanigen, is less than happy about Peter's probing, and decides that he can put a stop to it by giving the students a real-life demonstration of their technology.  The students are shrunk down to one-half inch, and Drake figures that he can eliminate them while staging a fake accident that would explain their disappearance with no trace.  The situation gets more complicated when the students are able to escape, and Drake mobilizes all his resources to clean up the situation. Finding people that small is not always an easy matter, however...<br /><br />Having a group of miniaturized people in the lush tropical environment of Hawaii lets the story unfold in some creative ways. Insects become deadly predators, and man goes from the top of the food chain to the sub-basement.  The authors do a good job in describing the environment from those perspectives, and I thought that worked very well. Of course, you have to be willing to work with the premise that this is all possible, and that these experiments having been going on for some time with no one catching on. There wasn't a lot of backstory to the characters, the result being a small bit of flatness in terms of motivations.

Insects become deadly predators, and man goes from the top of the food chain to the sub-basement.

0439023491|1.0|What a waste of money.  I should have read the mature reviews (1, 2 and 3 star).  The 907 twelve year olds posting 5 stars are not to be believed.<br />The Hunger Games had that touch of genius we all love to find.  STOP, trust me, STOP after the first book.  Our heroine goes all Bella....whiny,<br />immature and boring.<br /><br />By the way, the film preview for HG looks great.
B005VT42BS|4.0|This is a handy app if you need or want to know details about the network you are connected to, and is quite customizable.  There are two problems, however.  The first problem I saw was, on my Kindle Fire, trying to open the WiFi settings in the app's settings panel results in an error \\"The application Settings (process com.android.settings) has stopped unexpectedly.\\" The other problem is that that there is no 'exit' command to shut down the app, so if I use the \\"Back\\" or \\"Home\\" button on my Kindle Fire the app continues to run anyway (using CPU cycles, memory, and battery power).  I have to go into the app manager and force close it to get it to stop running, which is quite annoying.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I'm not much for zombie shows or movies of any kind.  It's the human aspect of the show that drew me in.  What they do, how they survive, the relationships that are made when the basic tenents of society as we know it have been broken down.  I'd watch something like that even if there were no zombies.  However, the zombies aspect of this show adds a wonderful scary element of danger that can't help but make one wonder what they themselves would do in such a situation.  This is a drama.  It's people plucked out of every day life and dropped into a new and terrifying world that looks exactly the same.  It's about how they survive. It's not meant to be about zombies macking on people for an hour.  Though the fact that that could happen does make it interesting.  The zombies themselves are disgustingly well done and gross and the gore is quite graphic and realistic.  When a zombie bites into someone's neck and rips the flesh free and blood spurts and sprays...it looks real.  There is a very disgusting scene involving a well in Season 2 that I will not go into other than to say...Wow.  I've seen R rated horror movies that weren't that well done or dramatic.  Granted, the zombies are thankfully dense and sheeplike and they have only one purpose.  To feed.  On you.  Add in a little imagination as to how you would survive in such a world and the show is quite compelling.<br /><br />I wont get into characterization too much other than to say there is a hodge podge to choose from. Some you will like, some you wont.  Some will be easy to identify with and others will really make you think about what choices YOU would make in their place.  All will surprise you at some point and you may just cheer for the most unlikely of hereos as well as the obvious ones.  If you can handle the gore - this is a show not to be missed.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Ever seen a horror movie with hillbillies in it? They're usually psychotic chainsaw-swinging inbred cannibal psychos who like to murder anyone who happens to drive by.<br /><br />But don't expect any of THAT to actually appear in \\"Tucker & Dale Vs Evil,\\" a clever black comedy that asks, \\"What if the HILLBILLIES were the innocent victims of the doomed college kids?\\" Tropes are inverted (or lampshaded), there's gore aplenty, and Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine make endearingly rough-hewn heroes.<br /><br />West Virginia hillbillies Dale (Labine) and Tucker (Tudyk) have just bought a dilapidated little house out by a remote lake, and plan to spend some time fishing and drinking beer. They also end up rescuing Allison (Katrina Bowden), a college student who hit her head while swimming, and she soon finds that these seemingly terrifying hillbillies are actually kind, gentle and sometimes quite smart.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Allison's friends get the wrong idea, and think that she's being held captive by a pair of chainsaw-swinging psychos. As they try to attack Dale and Tucker, they end up accidentally dying in bizarre and gory ways. As Dale, Tucker and Allison try to defuse the situation, they also have to deal with the increasingly bloodthirsty Chad (Jesse Moss).<br /><br />I have no idea why it's taken so long for \\"Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil\\" to make it onto DVD, because this movie is absolutely hilarious -- a gory, satirical little comedy that acknowledges every hillbilly-slasher cliche right before turning it on its ear. And yes, writer/director Eli Craig homages many a horror movie, from \\"Evil Dead\\" to \\"Friday the 13th.\\"<br /><br />And even though it's obviously a spoof, \\"Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil\\" is actually very well-written -- clever foreshadowing, a shocking climactic twist, and all sorts of hilarious situations that make Dale and Tucker look... well, like psycho hillbillies. For instance: Tucker accidentally destroys a beehive, and ends up racing through the woods, screaming and waving his chainsaw spastically.<br /><br />And yes, there are lots of OTHER hilarious moments, such as lampshading hillbilly stereotypes (\\"Oh, I love Earl Grey\\") and the college kids' gory deaths (impaling themselves on sticks or jumping into woodchippers).<br /><br />And the acting is absolutely brilliant. Labine and Tudyk are amazing as the protagonists, respectively playing a sweet timid teddy bear and an outgoing good ol' boy. Yeah, don't judge these guys from their appearances, because you will be ALL WRONG. And the rest of the small cast also does an excellent job, especially given that most of them are shrieking horror movie cliches.<br /><br />\\"Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil\\" is pretty clearly destined to be a cult classic, right alongside other fun spoofs like \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\" Hilarious, bloody and clever.And yes, there are lots of OTHER hilarious moments, such as lampshading hillbilly stereotypes (\\"Oh, I love Earl Grey\\") and the college kids' gory deaths (impaling themselves on sticks or jumping into woodchippers).

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help is an absolutely fantastic movie and one that I can't recommend highly enough!  There are very few movies these days that you watch and think \\"this is going to be a classic one day\\" but I really think this will be.  Although I haven't read the book (I'll be ordering it soon), the film is wonderful.  I seriously think I cried at least four times... I've not done that since I watched Titanic back in 1998!<br /><br />Minnie was my favourite character by far but all the actors were incredible - I can't name one who didn't really get you believing in their character.  Heart wrenching, sad, funny (in places), tragic - these words sum up the movie.  I really recommend it - watch it if you get the chance!!!

B006FTCH2E|2.0|This film is a small, artsy independent film and it shows just a bit too much. Most of the film is consumed by silence. The silence isn't filled with stunning visual images or movement, but rather just the main character Rhoda being depressed with her lot in life. Unlike say 2001: Space Odyssey, where the silence has meaning, here in this movie it's simply boring.  The whole concept of the second Earth is supposed to be a philosophical metaphor for the fact that small acts of luck/misfortune can dramatically alter somebody's life. However, it's a bit overdone. The whole concept of a second Earth literally just hanging out in space next to ours is way too unrealistic and unscientific to carry the film. Viewers can't take it seriously. Other sci-fi movies movies have explored the concept of decisions and chance in life with much more grace and entertainment.

B005P89F1C|5.0|This is an excellent Christmas album for all ages. Justin did a great job making it classic, traditional, contemporary, and pop. His recreation of the songs we all know and love truly show his singing talent; whereas his new songs show his talents as a creator and producer of music and song writing. I am not a Justin maniac fan, but I love every song, which is not usually something that can be said for most albums. I feel Under the Mistletoe proves to all that Justin truly deserves all the attention he is getting.  Also, the price is just right!

0060974176|5.0|This book opened my eyes to why we (the US) lost our lead in manufacturing. I have been handing these out as gifts to people - it was that good. The data are from the 80's, and several of the companies cited have reformed themselves (or since gone bankrupt). Interestingly, one lesson the US government learned was to incent foreign car makers to manufacture in the US. Perhaps it is time to reapply this to other industries...

1451627289|2.0|I just finished \\"11/22/63\\" and can report that Stephen King does not know how to write a historical novel. (It's marginally sci-fi/fantasy: a time-travel story, but the fantastic elements are mostly devices to get the protagonist from 2011 to the late 50s, where we remains until '63.)  King is a master plotter, so the tale is a diverting. It's a long book, and I stayed with it until the end, because King definitely made me want to know \\"what happens next?\\" But I ONLY cared about what-happens-next. I didn't care much about what's-happening-now, because King doesn't know how to pepper his narrative with sensual, historical detail.  What you want from a novel like this (or at least what I want) is the feeling you get from watching \\"Mad Men.\\" You want to feel the fabric of 1963 suits and hats. You want to be shocked by people littering without care. But you don't want the writer to just tell you that people littered without care. You want to see the crackerjack box (or whatever) tumbling to the sidewalk.  I kept thinking King must have cheated on research, maybe just skimming wikipedia. The book didn't seem to be written by someone who had immersed himself in the Cold War years. It seemed to be written by someone who had just learned some facts. So I was surprised to read, in his afterward, about the stack of books he read in preparation. I believe him. But I don't think he read in the right way. I honestly didn't feel much difference between King's 2011 and King's 1963.  In an afterward, King acknowledges Jack Finney's \\"Time and Again\\" as the best time-travel story ever written, and as the inspiration for his book. Sadly, it didn't inspire him enough. Finney's book, in which his protagonist travels to Manhattan in 1882, has such a feeling of verisimilitude that, when it came out, some people thought Finney was a real time traveler. It's too bad King didn't learn more of Finney's craft.   Here's \\"11/22/63\\" at it's MOST evocative:   \\"I started across the street, then pulled back as an inner-city bus snored toward me. The route sign above the divided windshield read LEWISTON EXPRESS. When the bus braked to a stop at the railroad crossing, I saw most of the passengers were smoking. The atmosphere must have been roughly akin to the atmosphere of Saturn. ...  ... A kind was standing outside the Fruit Company with one black-booted foot cocked back against the wood siding. The coller of his shirt was turned up at the nape of his neck, and his hair was combed in a style I recognized (from old movies, mostly) as Early Elvis ...  ... I went inside. A bell jingled above the door. ... To my right was a rack of comic books with their covers torn off -- Archie, Batman, Captain Marvel, Plastic Man, Tales from the Crypt.\\"  Okay, but what did the art in the comics look like? Were their ads as well as comic panels? Did the paper have a smell? And that bus: did it look any different from a 2011 bus? Did it puff out any more exhaust? Was the driver wearing a cap? What sort of clothes was the kid wearing? Was the turned-up coller the same as the sort of coller on my shirts?  The details: Early Elvis, everyone smoking, Plastic Man ... and pretty pedestrian and the sort of thing I could dig up quickly from wikipedia or memory. There's nothing surprising. There's nothing sensual.   Here, in contrast, is a bit of Finney's novel. This is representative of the sort of prose you'll find on almost every page:  \\"Then I heard the distant frantic sound of a bell, growing louder with every clang, and as we crossed Thirty-third Street it was suddenly a brain-numbing fury of sound to the west. Kate scrambled upright beside me, I turned to look, and here it came straight for us, a team of immense white horses, manes flying, hoofs pounding, drawing a red-and-brass fire engine, the driver slashing his whip at the horses, a flat stream of white smoke lining out behind it like the wake of a ship. The bell was wild now, the pounds of hoofs on the cobbles os fast and in such unison that the sound was a throb. It was frightening to see that smoke-belching fury roaring straight at us, and our driver lashed out at his horse, and jolted on across the street and out of its way. Behind us, we saw it dash on across Fifth, red-and-gilt spokes flashing, drivers reining up to hold the path clear. Four or five blocks farther on we heard the sound again, and this time to the south, and I remembered that this was a city of wooden beams, floors and walls, and of open-flame lighting and heat.  All the while we clip-clopped on, block after block downtown into the busy part of the city, the street traffic grew heavier. ... I lowered my window to stick out my head, and the noise was hard to believe.  We were at the intersection where Broadway crosses Fifth, and vehicles were pouring from Broadway to join our traffic stream, which was just possible, or to fight their way across it, which was almost impossible. Nearly every vehicle had four wheels and every wheel has wrapped in iron that smashed and rang against the cobbles, every horse had four iron-shod hoofs that did the same, and there was no control whatsoever. Wheels clattered, wood groaned, chains rattled, leather creaked whips cracked against horseflesh, men shouted and cursed, and no street I've ever seen of the twentieth century made even half that brain-numbing sound.\\"  Mr. King: don't just acknowledge Jack Finney. Listen to him!  [[ASIN:0684801051 Time and Again]]

B0034G4P9E|5.0|I am not an MMA fan, but I can not EVER remember seeing a movie with this many reviews rated at 5 stars on Amazon . After reading a few reviews, I decided it was worth renting. Well it was, and then some.  No need for a lengthly review, it has all been said. But my wife (who cannot EVER stay awake past 10PM), stayed up past midnight watching this one. Terrific drama that is well written with superior acting performances.

B003MC5N28|5.0|I have always loved this novel--in fact, I would easily call it my favorite of all time.  Lowry paces it perfectly--and it meaningfully displays the need for opposition--all good things do come with bad.  If there was no sorrow, than nobody would have anything to compare happiness to--and happiness therefore becomes obsolete.  If there was no happiness, there would be nothing to compare sorrow to--and no one would ever learn or develop from their mistakes.  Lowry's message remains clear throughout the novel, and she shows that message wonderfully in The Giver.  Francis Bacon once said, \\"Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, but only a few are to be chewed and digested.\\"  Digest this one, it's an incredible book that deserves its Newbery Award.

B004LWZW4C|2.0|This Blu-ray won't play on some players, and needs a workaround to play on others.  The Fox Web site is utterly useless for customer support for this disc -- I had to come here to the reviews on Amazon to find the unofficial workaround before I could get even the menu screen to play.<br /><br />For my Sony machine (already updated with the latest firmware) the Blu-ray kept trying to connect to the Internet, probably because of Fox's latest, ridiculous copy protection scheme.  My player's Internet connection is fine, so I'm not sure what this Blu-ray's problem was, but to get the movie to play, I had to remove the Blu-ray, disable the player's internet connection, flush the BD data cache on the player, then re-insert the disc.  This is the only Blu-ray where I've had this problem.<br /><br />I'm going to think twice before buying any more Blu-rays from Fox.  It's utterly ridiculous that I should have to go through this kind of gymnastics just to play a legitimately purchased disc.<br /><br />The movie's worth your time, by the way, entertaining and engaging.  The script, acting and effects were all effective and tastefully done.  But none of that matters if you can't get the disc to play.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|The title pretty much says it all. There isn't a weak moment in the entire film because there isn't a weak actor among the cast. The movie is fun & has enough of the touch of realism to anchor it without tipping over into soap opera territory. Way too much fun for one movie & well worth the time spent thoroughly enjoying it.
B004EPZ0BG|2.0|Not a very good movie. Predictable & lame plot. We had to force ourselves to continue watching. Acting was not very good and was not believable.

Several of my friends said the ending made them bawl (or as one said, \\"made me bawl my eyes out\\"). My version was the audio CD, and it was so, so well done. But I still can't help but think my version (audio) of the ending outdid the text version. This story was phenomenal!

It has a neat compartment for storing additional cars plus the tow hook makes for interesting fun.  The missles shoot just as well as any spring loaded toy. I had worried about the string on the tow hook getting tangled inside the mechanism but so far it hasn't.  All in all a great toy for the price.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I had read many negative and mediocre reviews of this movie, but finally decided to get it anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was actually a very good movie, though my son commented that the scene with Wolverine walking away from an explosion was a bit contrived.  Like the other X-Men movies, it doesn't always follow the comic storyline, and some characters are different from the way they were in the comics.  However, taken on its own, this movie tells an interesting story of Wolverine's background, and successfully captures his basically good, decent character, without ignoring some of the things he has had to do in his life (and including the action scenes that are part of why people watch Wolverine).  It also gave a good look at Gambit, which finally made me able to see the charm of this character.  There is some timeline continuity problem between this movie and X-Men First Class, and a little with the later movies.  At the end of First Class, Xavier is around 30 and still has his hair when he is paralyzed.  Near the end of this movie, there is a short scene of a bald Xavier walking.  Also, Scott Summers is a minimum of 14 in 1962 in this movie, and seems no older than 30 in X-Men 1, set somewhere in the 1990s (when he should have been at least 44 for continuity to work).  Overlooking these details (after all, the comics contradict each other periodically, too), this is an enjoyable movie and worth getting.  I actually liked it better than First Class (which I also enjoyed), though that one has better reviews.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|What a great movie this is!  I just got done viewing this for the first time and from the first scene to the last it is great!  An all-star cast makes this a pleasure to see.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Dame Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker and other brilliant actors make this movie interesting and captivating from beginning to end.  The \\"Red\\" Squad are retired CIA Agents and Assassins with a mix of old KGB and MI-6.  These \\"Cold War\\" warriors are definitely the people you don't want to mess with!  This movie is intelligent with the plot and it doesn't take itself too seriously and is great fun.  Many laugh-out loud scenes and you can tell all the actors/actressess had alot of fun making this movie.  Why are is the CIA out to get these retired agents?  Well, I wont spoil the movie for you.  Let's just say that when you get older you definitely get \\"better\\"!  Moldova Sucks!  Highly Recommended!

1250004217|5.0|I am not someone who reads every book under the sun - in fact, I often feel that I do not have time to read at all. This book, however, had me from the first chapter. I felt as though I never wanted to put it down. The switching between chapters always had me thinking \\"I'll just read one more\\". Before I knew it, the book was done. The author's writing style is light, making it easy to breeze right through (but all the while remaining entertained and curious about what comes next). I 100% recommend this book!

034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers tells the story of Victoria Jones, an 18 year old who has just been emancipated from the foster care system and unsure of how to begin her life on her own. We read about Victoria through her present situation and her past experiences when she was nine years old and sent to live with a woman named Elizabeth. We find that the only connection that Victoria can make with other people is through flowers. At 18 she is scared and homeless until she begins working at a flower shop and finds her talent for picking out flowers that will make her customers happy. When she is just beginning to find a way to a future for herself she meets a man with a connection to her past that makes her come to terms with the mistakes she has made.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was beautifully written and drew me in from the very beginning. Victoria's story is heartbreaking and made me think of all the children that go through the foster care system and how truly hard it must be. I thought Diffenbaugh did a wonderful job of showing Victoria's thought processes and relating to us the reason why she made she choices she made. I really enjoyed watching Victoria change and grow through the book. It was so hard for her to reach out to others because of her past, it was nice to see her try to connect to others, even in small ways.<br /><br />Before reading this book I knew almost nothing about flowers. I do not garden and know few names of different flowers. I feel like I got quite an education about flowers in this book and it was very interesting. I think that every time I see a flower now I will be wondering what its definition is in a Victorian flower dictionary. This is a wonderful story that I would highly recommend and I am looking forward to future books from this impressive author.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book should not be compared to any other. It is like unearthing a treasure or eating a rich piece of cake, if anything, but yet something completely unique and beautiful as well as breathtaking.   The story is an intricate tale that follows a circus, enchanted one at that, that starts as a game, a show of strength and eventually evolves into something much more than that, a forbidden exchange of love letters between two opponents. But it also follows not only the two magicians, but also every aspect of the circus, from the creators to the attendees, to the twins born the night the first night the circus is born as well.   All enchanting in the most luxurious prose, this story is not a quick read (though I did devour it in less than a day), it does something more impatient readers probably won't have the patience for, it builds characters and setting as well as everything around it. Ms. Morgensten weaves a beautiful and rich tapestry that brings the book to life in such a way I hadn't thought possible in a while with stories.   I would recommend this book to everyone who has ever wanted to run away with the circus, or wanted to be completely immersed in a story with all the senses. Now I just need to finish my red scarf on top of my black and white outfit. <3
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Black Swan consisted of mental and physical mutilation scenes, theft, self-loathing, drugs, drinking, vomiting, long self-pleasure, male/female and female/female sex scenes, perverted old men touching themselves and the lead actress. Verbal and mental abuse, murder and suicide, and a sickly looking lead actress crying most of the time while supposedly portraying a ballet dancer who was picked for the lead part in Swan Lake.  It was monumentally disturbing on so many levels and ruined a nice evening.
0385535139|4.0|I'm a long time fan of John Grisham and once again he has the ability to pull you right into the book as in this case a partner in the the law firm.  It's as if he's reporting on actual cases and the class action suit is much like you read aout in the newspaper.  I find myself laughing or disbelieving or encouraging whatever is appropriate for that particular portion of the book.  Marcie Nelson
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|great movie and now very happy these are all together in one collection on Blu - ray.  great quality. loved it because it is very compact in this case too.  I also loved the price because I found it on Cyber Monday.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Had some weak wi-fi signal spots in the house.  I used the Scanner Wi-Fi app to find the relative signal strengths and where was best to use them.  I found out that with a vertically polarized wi-fi signal, the KF is most sensitive when held in portrait mode, as vertical as possible.  The signal strength was greatest when the wi-fi unit was in the plane of the display.  Turning the KF to landscape mode display, the signal strength dropped off about 5 dB.  For maximum wi-fi signal, turn the KF sideways to the broadcasting wi-fi router and use the portrait mode display mostly vertical.  There is loss of signal when holding flat in the lap, with the router on normal line to the KF.  But Wi-fi scanner is great.  The scanner does give a lot of information about the other scanners in the neighborhood but I have not had occasion to use the feature.  Again, this is the best app I have found for the KF.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|We watched this last night and it was so captivating from beginning to end. A great cast lead by just the right actress - Jemima Rooper. I can't  imagine it without her. It's one of the best things that I've ever seen. So completely satisfying.

B00656C6KK|5.0|Doris Day's 'My Heart,' the first CD in too many years is a joy.  Ms. Day's beautiful voice filled my home for hours last week as I listened and remembered; for a walk down memory lane is in most of the tracks.  If you loved Ms. Day's music as a young person, you'll fall in love all over again with his CD.
B00007AJGH|5.0|This DVD is in excellent condition. The order was processed quickly, I received this in time for my son for Christmas. It's an old family favorite that we previously had on VHS.
B004H7QICG|2.0|This case is a piece of crap.  Why would they put the hard drive part of the case where it is?  I have a GTX-580 in the case and it's impossible to get anything larger than an SSD in there.  Why would I ever buy such a large case and not intend to put more than one hard drive in it?  I have 4 hard drives that I intended to put in.  But, now I have to buy separate, hot-swappable slot loading drive enclosures just to fit the hard drives in this case.  I don't understand why people review it so highly.  Are your standards really that low?    Nearly every case I see online is a piece of crap and/or is so ugly and badly designed that I'm considering buying an old G5 tower and modifying it to accommodate the motherboard and components I am using to build this dual boot hackintosh.  It really is a situation where it's either buy an apple computer or get screwed on VERY low quality components.  The other reviewers should look around and raise their standards.  I am furious at this piece of trash.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I HAD to get this movie to complete my harry potter collection. I had all except the deathly hallows parts 1 and 2. So I made sure I bought part 1 and got part 2 for christmas. Amazon priced it perfect because it was cheaper than walmart!
0316077054|1.0|I ordered this book on Dec 24th and have been waiting for it ever since then. I checked the expected shipping date and it said January 18th. Seeing how it was supposed to be 5-7 days I have to say that is pretty ridiculous!!

145551389X|5.0|A++++ Love this book! Huge Gaga fan and this was my top gift. There is no writting in it, except a introduction from Lady Gaga within the first couple pages. Ther rest of the book are just candid photos from her tour, backstage, hotel rooms, etc.
1451648537|5.0|This is a great book about Steve Jobs, very well written. It gives insight on what it was like to be Jobs from his own perspective and also what others are saying about him. He was a man with lot of drawbacks but everyone did agree that he was a genius who saw what others failed to see and was able to drive a whole lot of people in achieving that goal. It also gives good insight into the thought process that went into each Apple Product and also into other ventures of Steve Jobs. Overall a good book and time well spent.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|I thought this movie was dumb when I first started watching it. But after it ended I understood what the movie was about. And I enjoyed it. It is a trip. I don't know if anyone else noticed in the beginning of the movie visions of Brad Pit appeared before he sees him on the airplane.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|why just a preview? if that is all it is, adverrtise it as such. very disappointing and makes me wonder if PRIME is  GOOD DEAL
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm not much of a book person and the only book I have ever read and finished was \\"Quiet Strength\\" by Tony Dungy. Last night I downloaded this book on my Kindle Fire and read the entire today, which is quite an accomplishment since I don't read books...not to mention its the last week of the regular season in the NFL! Just goes to show what a great book this is! The author does a great job bringing her characters to life, and the story really keeps your attention and keeps you wanting to find out what happens next.  Like I said, I don't really care to read books, nor do I write reviews.  This book was just different.  It was such a great story I felt like I should share my thoughts.  I would highly recommend this book!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|What a great finale to the Harry Potter saga.  It was a great adventure and the finale was very satisfying as it tied up all the loose ends from all the books.  I loved it.
0316044695|5.0|I was watching a hunting show with my husband and one of the guest hunters was Mr. Luttrell.  They mentioned his book and I bought it.    I was amazed at the training a Navy Seal goes through.  He made you feel the pain with every exercise he did. I found his attitude to be quite \\"cocky\\" at times...but after reading his ordeal I totally understand his attitude.  I highly reccomend this book.  It makes me mad as hell the way the government makes the rules of war and they have never fought a war themselves.  To be told not to shoot the enemy unless they shoot first ..when you know full well they are the enemy and not a farmer or civilian is ludicrous.

B00364K6YW|5.0|There are so many reviews for this one, there's not much need to go on and on.  Put simply, this is the best film adaptation of the book that I've seen to date.  Enough said. =)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love intuitive interface for this app. It is quick and there more translations than I will ever use. The only problem is on a wifi only device there need to be more offline translations available.

0060558121|5.0|If Neil Gaiman could create a movie in our minds, this would be it. I really wish that this will be carefully created into a film. Once you start reading this, you cannot stop. There are, however some parts that may seem like it goes off in unnecessary details, but it does help to read the God's history. I've never been one to like fantasy or mythological stories, but Neil Gaiman has done it, and has made me a believer in these gods, and that America is in fact, a bad place for gods.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This concert was amazing and I would highly recommend it. Adele mentioned she was recovering from a respiratory infection but her performance was one to remember. There were just a few times when she might not have hit a note as high as she would have liked but it didn't matter, it was still extraordinary. Playing Royal Albert Hall was her dream come true and it was such an emotion night for her and that came through in the music. Can't wait to see what her next project will be. At 23, let's hope she has many more dreams come true in her music.
0515149489|5.0|Being a dog trainer and murder mystery enthusiast this book was a great read.Not a big fan of romance but Simon and Fiona made me laugh numerous times with their building relationship.

B004EPYZSU|1.0|My mom decided to FIOS this movie.  I had heard good things about it.  I think I heard it was a buy or at least rent on DVDUESDAY.  Well, I would have to disagree.  The movie is about these people in a town, set back in the days when cowboys and Indians were around, who find aliens have come to get something from them.  That is the story.  Then, you have a guy who was with a woman, though you never see them together, who wakes up and does not remember anything.  But, he has this weird thing around his wrist.  Turns out aliens may have taken him and the lady and some how he got away.  He is also wanted for killing the lady.  Though he may not have done that.  Get it?  That is the story.<br /><br />Now for the bad part, or \\"the movie\\" itself.  Wow, so many things were wrong with this in my opinion.  Let me take it one step at a time.<br /><br />First the actors.  There were a bunch of great actors in the movie.  Some you would see the entire time, others here and there.  But, for some reason, it felt like I was watching a trailer the entire time.  Almost like a movie they made to show at the Oscars.  It was very odd.<br /><br />Next, the effects and backgrounds.  AWFUL,  everything that you see in the movie, you can tell that it is fake and not very well done.  The mountains may have been actually mountains, but they were the worst mountains that I've ever seen.  The times when you saw the aliens or the technology they used also seemed cheaply done.  It was like I was watching a damn commercial or something from 10 years ago.  Watch the movie and reply with what you think.<br /><br />Next would be the story.  Ok, so aliens that are smart enough to fly around the never ending space and then find something on our planet they need and or want.  Are you telling me they would not just come, take what it was and leave without us even knowing?  For some reason they are pissed off and decide to kill the people.  But that is just a story choice I suppose.  For some reason, I could never get into this movie.  I love movies like this normally.  I am a 26 year old guy who is kind of a nerd.  But everything just felt so fake.  Like it was being shoved down my throat.  After 15 minutes, I had already forgotten what had happened before.  It was like I was watching something trying so hard to be funny, action packed, thrilling and mysterious, that never really got there.  Oh, and it you have eyes, you may want to skip this movie.  Why you ask?  For at least 2/5 of the movie.  My family and I could not see a damn thing.  The lighting if some of the worst I've ever seen, or haven't seen for that matter.  We were all like \\"what the hell is going on?\\"  At one part one of the characters asks if the man can see his target.  I busted out laughing.  The end is boring and you will probably be upset you wasted your time watching.  For so many good actors and a good director, this movie sucked.  If this is what aliens bring, then let us send E.T back home!!!!<br /><br />As I said, we rented this from FIOS.  So, I can not review the special features or the packaging.love movies like this normally.  I am a 26 year old guy who is kind of a nerd.  But everything just felt so fake.

B000FC130E|1.0|I realllllly tried to complete this book with enthusiasm to read it, but I found that it was an inner personal chore to complete at least 2 pages of this book (kindle version). Neil Gaiman is my favorite author this month after reading American Gods and Anansi Boys, but this...this story does not do anything for me. It came to the point where I had to return it because the story infact goes NOWHERE as mentioned in a previous review. Maybe it was because this was an early story of Gaiman, but I'm definitely glad that he has stories much much better than this in present day.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I love this app. This is the most cleanest, easiest to use calendar AND supports google tasks.<br /><br />Would it be possible to include scrolling on the task widget?
B004WCTLNY|5.0|It was a great movie. It had a very interesting concept, what it would be like if there was a higher power that, unknowingly to us, used messengers to make things happen in our lives, sometimes against our will. The main character discovers this, and spends all his energy fighting for his chance to choose his own destiny. Suspenseful, exciting, and had a sweet love story. Best of all, i thought it had a happy ending.
0156030306|5.0|This is a wonderful journey into the mind of a mentally retarded man who becomes a genius through an operation. The story is told in first person through the man's progress notes. There is so much underlying meaning to this short story and I enjoyed it so much that I read it in one seating. It stimulates the mind as an aged wine does the palate. There are layers upon layers waiting to be uncovered.   I remember reading this book around the seventh grade but I do not remember understanding all the context. I can think back to my education from elementary school through graduate school and relate to Charlies progression. This connected me to the character and provided an emotional experience I never expected from a short story. The juxtaposition of his reunion with his senile abusive mother and his impending descend into darkness was brilliant. There is so much to this story that a second read is definately warrented.   Spolier  There are two parts in the story as Charlie Regresses that he has a Psychedelic experience, the first he almost breaks through into another level of existence but is tugged back by external forces. The second time occurred as he made love to Alice for the first time. This time I like to imagine that the Intelligent Charile's mind made it out of the cage of unitelligent Charlie's mind into the Ether. This thought provides comfort through the ending.
B002ZG9968|5.0|This DVD was for my daughter.  She asked for it on her birthday.  It came promptly when I ordered it.  It was an excellent price compared to the stores.  I will always get movies from Amazon. The movies come in good condition.  Thanks Amazon.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Got this \\"free app of the day\\" and now I know why people won't pay for it.  Although things go fine for about 10-15 minutes, the game will then either freeze, or just QUIT and take you back to Home Page on the Fire.  Please, developers, FIX THIS APP. I won't play it again until I see an update, and the update better fix the problem, or it's off my device forever.<br />UPDATE:  Several months have passed, and I no longer have the Kindle Fire, getting instead a Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Since I had purchased this app for my Fire, I was able to download it to my Galaxy from the Amazon cloud after I registered that device with them.  In the meantime, apparently the developer must have seen all the bad reviews and fixed the problems.  This app now works well, and I upgraded my previous One Star to Four Stars.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Looking for a non-earbud headphone that was lightweight and could be easily worn while biking, I settled on these, on the strength of the favorable Amazon-published reviews. . . and, those reviews were spot on!  Exceptional sensitivity, good fidelity (a bit bright, a bit bass-shy), fairly comfortable, but at the price - what a buy!  I bought a second set as a backup (even though I try to be careful with them, stuff happens).  They are perfect for what I use them for.  Sony could easily quadruple the price, and still have a good deal on these!
B000B5MI3Q|1.0|The watch looks nice, however after  few days of use, it stops working without any reason. We tried reading the manual, kept using it to see if was some mistake, but it stopped again when we were out of the country last week. I don't want this watch anymore!

This book is perfect for anyone, my mom loved it and my sister was the one who got me hooked on it!!!! so purchase this book and i promise you will not be sorry!!!
B004EPZ084|5.0|I bought this movie for my sister for Christmas. Since it comes with the free rental I was able to watch it before it even arrived! After she opened it I didn't mind watching it again. It was hilarious and we both laughed until we cried. I would recommend this movie to everyone and especially from Amazon since you get the rental as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this book when I saw the previews for the movies. My niece needed to read it for school, so we set off to read it together. Definitely a page turner, literally left hanging at ends of chapter forcing me to continue reading. Which at sometimes was difficult due to time. But that would NEVER stop me from recommending it. But I warn you, you will have to read book two due to the ending of one!
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I LOVE this game!!! You get to go into the hairstyling buisness as a young woman named Sally. You continue working with her from a little store in the mall to serving celebrities. You can buy things or hire employees. I reccomend for ages 9 and older.

0553801473|4.0|I read the first four books this year, in 3 or  4 months. It was an unforgetable experience, especially with Game of Thrones going on in HBO. I concur with everything said about the series in these pages, I have not finished this book, 125 or so pages left,no hurry, if we will have to wait another 5 or 6 years for the next book and 10 or 11 for the supposedly last one. there are a lot of readers out there that will not be alive to see this,
B00000JLWW|5.0|TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron's Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year's Day 2012 - a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood. One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.<br /><br />But for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie's release.  Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch.  From there the opulence of the 'unsinkable' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose's mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose's intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.<br /><br />In retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note: Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc.  The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit.  Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress.  Grady Harp, January 12ary 12

B005A1ER0I|5.0|I have all of Two Steps from Hell so after listening to the previews of Thomas Bergersen's Illusions (at the time there were no reviews) I went ahead and bought it.  It took me to another level of listening enjoyment I had yet to experience.  Other music has disappointed me due to it sounding the same throughout but this one is just amazing.  Every offering is unlike the other and evokes a gamut of emotions.  I am blown away by the complexities of these arrangements and their ability to take me away to someplace where I can close my eyes and let my imagination roam where it will.  As an artist I enjoy listening to this as I paint, it gives me strength and even adds something that I am often missing in my art - emotion.  If you enjoy this type of music; large orchestral arrangements, themes that build or fade, unusual voices and ranges which are just as effective as the music and a list of songs you will not tire of I URGE you to make this a present to yourself.  You will not regret it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|fantastic!  Lots of options for reading, note taking, and keeping track of it all.  Even reminds you to read if you have selected a plan and want that to happen.  options for cut and paste even, making it easy for keeping notes in outside apps like Evernote.  I use it almost daily, and now that I have discovered the reading plans, it will by used everyday.
B005D0RDIE|4.0|I have been a fan of Rush for around 23 years, starting at age 15.  I have always loved Rush's music, even if I didn't agree with the lyrics and (lack of) beliefs.  However, let me tell you, this concert DVD was more than enough to win me, or any other serious music fan, over time and time again.  From 'Faithless' to 'Marathon', the sheer skill, intensity, and joy in playing the music just radiates off all three of the boys throughout the DVD's setlist.  The chops are as solid as ever, the synths and guitars sound the best they ever have, and Neil's performance is simply stellar throughout.  During the concert, it's so great to see Geddy and Alex interact with each other, Neil, and the audience.  They create this kind of energy that lets you KNOW that they are the best rock'n roll band in the world.    My only problem with the DVD was (just as it was in the concert) are the Time Machine themed movie shorts.  I never quite get Rush's quirks or humor; maybe it's just me.  It was simply a let down for me, I suppose.  It's true that their music and lyrics and sophisticated enough that the movies serve as a sort of 'comic relief', but it just doesn't work for me.  I actually liked the seemingly stoic (well, relatively speaking) A Show of Hands VHS and DVD.  Having said all of this, if you are into Rush's humor, then the Time Machine DVD will not disappoint.  The sound and quality of the DVD seem reasonable.  I played the DVD through a 42\\" HDTV without surround sound, so I cannot make too many comments about the technical merits of the DVD.  The concert presentation of lighting seemed very, very good; just being able to see the gear and Geddy, Alex, and Neil's hadn and foot work, respectively, made for the best visuals.  Again, though, I was not into most of the concert backdrop visuals, aside for those for maybe Subdivisions.  The Moving Pictures figures just seem odd.  Thanks to this DVD and my memories of the 2010 tour, I just can't say enough good things about Rush.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. great for boring days. not to much thinking required and the kids enjoy it too! thanks for the fun!
1423101464|5.0|Have purchased from this seller three times now and the description is right on. My son loves these books and I was able to give him 3 of the series that he didn't have nor did his school book fair have them. They were new enough to give to him for Christmas! Excellent timing with shipping and good packaging
B0036EH3WU|5.0|From the first when I started to watch it, I was hooked. The show just kept me going. The characters were fascinating. The acting was very good, particularly Jorge Garcia. The stories were original and interesting full of clever twists. I would stay up late way past bedtime just to find out what was going to happen.   When I discussed it with a friend who had seen it, he told me the show is good but the ending is terrible so just miss the last season. Well, I have just seen the last season, and I liked that too. I think it is a fine ending.    I would recommend it.
0316069884|5.0|\\"Eating Animals\\" stands out as a text with thematic complexity, in addition to being meticulously researched.  I taught Foer's book in an undergraduate level class on the Literature of the Self.  Students responded very positively.  Many made actual changes in their food choices.  This book is a must read for anyone interested in compassion, ethics, and the meaning of being human.
B005ORVN1Y|3.0|Having finally digested all the discs I ask the following question about the Signals discs.You have three versions of Signals; the CD version, another version of the CD but on DVD and then the 5.1 mix.Now whilst the mixes on the two 'normal' versions are good, I expected more. The best versions I've ever heard of songs from Signals were the three twelve inch singles; New World Man, Subdivisions and Countdown and I'm not sure why I have two stereo mixes which are disappointing.  Then there is the 5.1 mix which is totally different, different vocal takes, different guitar tracks,and can someone please tell me what is going on in the middle of The Weapon where the guitar drops out then comes back out of time.Surely  we could have got a mix of the CD enhanced like the awesome version of The Analog Kid on the 5.1 version.  Grace Under Pressure was a nice surprise as I had it on vinyl 20 years ago, and it has aged well.Initially after Signals I didn't like its dark tone.  Power Windows is better with more bottom end and less distortion on Alex's chorus/flanged guitar, and the keyboard taken back a bit.It has dated well  I hated Hold Your Fire when it first came out and nothing endears me to it now.It sounds dated with that awful electric piano and cheesy synth effects along with Alex's guitar that sounds really trebly and thin at times.  Fortunately A Show of Hands sounds better and I am in the audience at the Birmingham concert.Ironically the Hold Your Fire songs sound miles better live.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This artist is the best to come along in a long time.  The mix is great on this CD.  Highly recommend to any jazz buffs.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Could not find this movie at the stores where I live, but sure found it on Amazon. This movie was a gift to my daughter for Christmas and I got it way ahead of time and she loved it.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I loved The Name of the Wind from the first few pages and my interest in the book only grew over the next 700.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss has a poetic writing style that draws the reader into the story. He creates vivid impressions of the characters, environment and their story.<br /><br />The novel drew from me deep emotions for the protagonist, Kvothe. During his highs and lows I was easily compelled to care and feel for him. I was drawn deep into the plot.<br /><br />I would recommend this series as a must-read for fantasy novel fans.

B001HN690O|3.0|Not as good as the first one. It's not bad but just isn't as funny or original this time around.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I don't know what you crybabys are doing, but I love the game. And that guy who had to buy the 3 boards, you probably downloaded the wrong game. I think it's fun.You can play on 3 boards. I can't think of anything else to put down right now,so all I am going to say is have fun.
0156034565|3.0|I read this strictly because of the trailer for the upcoming film adaptation.   It's a very light read, not too-chock-full of tangy British humourous flashes, some faint commentary and some actual character development.   A better novel might have resulted in more experienced hands, but all-in-all, not a waste of time...if indulgent in places.   'Well done!' to the author...and fingers-crossed for a much better movie.   Personal rating: 7/10
0143119680|5.0|I thought is was a great book , I can't wait until the next one is available , it's a great love story and with all the witch and vampire among other beings , I never got bored and couldn't seem at times to put it down .
B005G4TJI4|5.0|What can I say great movie, puchased for 16 year old wanted for ipod touch don't know if he has loaded the digital copy yet but we have watched the blu-ray.
1594484805|3.0|The basic premise for \\"Drive\\" is very strong and the research backing it up seems credible. It is more like a white paper, however, than a book. To add thickness, the author rehashes everything at the end and this is largely useless. I think it is a very valuable treatise, but not quite a book.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|I really wasn't going to watch this movie because I had heard it was just like the first one, but, I'm glad I did it was funny!
B0063GORYU|5.0|classic spider solitaire. very standard game but always fun. zip zip zip zip zip zip zip zip zip zip zip zip
B00000E2VC|5.0|I wholeheartedly recommend this recording of Chopin's Mazurkas. Though a selection of ten, rather than a full set, Michelangeli brings a masterful sense of thought and restraint to these works - the quintessential case of less is more. The recording (1972) is superb and wonderfully atmospheric - the whole disc has the feeling of an intimate recital. Also included is the Prelude cis-moll op.45, the Ballade g-moll op.23 and the Scherzo b-moll op.31.
1451627289|5.0|I was 14 years old when President Kennedy was assassinated and, if you'll forgive my borrowing a line from Mr. King, I was afraid to read this book because I was afraid it wouldn't \\"harmonize\\" with \\"my sense\\" of what happened during that time. Happily, I was way wrong on that score.  This book took me back, accurately, to that time. I heard the music, I remembered the cars, the dances, the hair-dos, and most of all the people and how they were. It was all there and it all fit with the mesmerizing story told in this book. And I love that Kennedy was not over-glorified nor was he made a villain. He was what he was, for better or not.  I have loved Steven King's books since the beginning. There are very few I have missed reading (although I never could get into the Dark Towers series). This is bar-none his best book ever. There were times while reading it that I fully expected to walk out my front door and see 1959 or 1960 before my eyes and to find Walter Cronkite on the evening news.  As always, when reading Steven King, I was vastly entertained, a teeny bit scared at times (I don't scare easily), and in the case of 11/22/63, I was moved to tears. You outdid yourself Steve. Thank you sincerely for the many hours of enjoyment you have provided to me over these many years. I'm glad I lived at the same time you were writing and that you didn't leave for earlier or later days! (And thanks for that last dance.)
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app...easy to use...no problems downloading or using this app. I recommend it for the kindle fire. .I appreciate having this app.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is so addicting. It works very well on my Kindle Fire. I love the graphics and auto finish.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|101 Games is full of short, fairly entertaining mini games. It is fun and somewhat addicting to try to unlock more games. The problem is with very sluggish/nonresponsive controls in the game
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is easy to pick up and gets very addictive. its hard to put it down and keeps you thinking.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|This film magically captures the essence of Christmas.  Set in Finland's stunning Lapland, the scenery adds to the power of the story.  I watched this with my kids and they loved it, then I watched it with my parents, and they loved it too!  The dubbing can be a bit off-putting at times but otherwise it's a fantastic Christmas film for everyone.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This was the gift to grab in the gift scramble.  Everybody (all ages) wanted it once they had a chance to hold it.  FYI:  I was reluctant to buy on line in light of the \\"breakage\\" reviews, but it seems like those are old reviews.  The quality control problem is fixed.  I ordered three and all arrived safe and sound.  That said, there is a heavy metal marble inside an intricately sculpted plastic sphere.  If you shake it around, you will do so at your own risk. This is the cleverest toy I've seen in a long time.  Came back to amazon to order one more... for my 50-year old self.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game that everyone likes to play so I like a lot.  there's a lot of fun games that are cool
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I just love angry birds I play until I my. kindle. runs out of charge I can never put it down I'm just angry bird crazy I don't know how u could give it one star or anything under 5
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This DVD is fantastic! It was huge hit at our New Years Eve party. Out standing back up band! Love the chit chat between tunes. What a personable performer!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I put quite a bit of effort into doing research on the Tritton AX Pros (and the Sharkoon equivalent), 720s, Turtle Beach DPX21s, and the X41s before I decided to invest in a good gaming headset, and I believe it was not at all wasted. For starters, I'll explain what the deal breakers were with the other 3 headsets.  AX Pros: They claim to have the best directional sound, but, according to very many reviews both on Amazon and on YouTube, the True 5.1 surround (4 speakers per earcup) not only diminishes sound quality, but also lacks the 3-D depth perception that is crucial to judge the position of enemy footsteps. My deduction was that cramming a whole surround sound system into a small earcup would be problematic, and so it seems. Countless reviews claim that the headset is hot and heavy. The mic is often said to need replacing. It's wired setup also seemed to be a pain as I watched setup videos on YouTube. No, thanks.  AX 720s: Like the X41s, these have the 5.1/7.1 digital surround sound. Overall, I'd say these are a close second. They look good to me, and a lot of people prefer them over the \\"higher end\\" Pros because of the sound quality and weight. They do supposedly weigh less than the Pros. The build quality of both Tritton headsets is apparently better, but they are both wired. I don't want wires in my way.  DPX21s: Don't buy these. The majority of the very many reviews I read claim that they break incredibly easily over one of the earcups. Turtle Beach has even admitted it according to one reviewer. There are multiple videos showing the broken headset, and that really was a turn-off. Also, the digital decoder that comes with the wired Ear Force headsets apparently puts out crappy sound quality, which I heard from akaTRENT on YouTube.  Now onto the winning headset, the X41. This is the only wireless headset of the ones I considered buying. I was skeptical about it at first because I didn't want to replace batteries constantly. However, I got a good deal ($105,prime shipping) on some used ones that don't have a scratch on them. I was able to buy a 4-pack of rechargeable AAA batteries with a charger with the money I saved from not buying the next cheapest headset of the group. This headset got the best reviews overall and seemed to have fewer problems than any of the others. The sound quality is great. Even though the surround sound is simulated, I have an easy time sound whoring well from all directions and distances in decent conditions. Some say the simulated surround is better than the true because there aren't a bunch of smaller speakers fighting for breathing room, which backs the idea of many reviewers that the Pros gave up sound quality for more speakers. The battery life is better than what I expected. Hardcore gamers will like that it will operate flawlessly for a nice, long session. It's extremely lightweight, comfortable for hours and hours, and very visually appealing in my opinion. The mic is crystal clear as well. The only thing I'm missing out on is the 7.1 surround because the 360 only puts out a 5.1 signal. It still works fine, though. the build quality could be better. It's a little flimsy, but nothing to complain about. You'd just expect more for the price tag. Overall, this headset is fantastic. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to spend a little dough to help his or her game.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Pricy, but worth it, perfect fit, not bulky, I hate cases that makes your devices huge, this one doesn't, great protection for your Kindle Fire, it is awsome, I love it.
B005OZ4E3A|5.0|\\"A tutto questo che verrà...\\"<br />\\"To all this that will come...\\"<br /><br />There has been a lot of hype surrounding Laura Pausini's eleventh studio album, \\"Inedito\\". It's been three years since her last new record, and for the last two of those years, she had stepped back from the spotlight. Would she continue with the pop sound of \\"Primavera in Anticipo\\" or return to the rock vibe present on \\"Resta in Ascolto\\"? Or would she go in a new direction entirely?<br /><br />The answer to all of these questions is yes. \\"Inedito\\" (\\"Brand New\\") is a little bit of everything, featuring the pop songs ('Nessuno Sa') that made \\"Primavera in Anticipo\\" stand out while maintaining some of the rock vibe of \\"Resta in Ascolto\\" ('Come Vivi Senza Me', 'Mi Tengo')  and even harkening back to the balladic sounds of \\"Tra Te E Il Mare\\" ('Celeste', 'Nel Primo Sguardo'). And, while I initially wasn't sure what to think of it, I now find myself appreciating it more and more.<br /><br />The record has definite hits on it. The ones that I have come to think of as the Big Four are:<br /><br />'Benvenuto' ('Welcome'), a pop tune that is nearly identical in structure to 'Mille Braccia' (from her previous studio album) but manages to convey a seriousness that the other one didn't quite have.<br /><br />'Non Ho Mai Smesso' ('I Never Stopped') is a strong ballad I suspect is about Pausini's break from music. Though I'm not a huge fan of its intro (on flute), it has a climax that is unforgettable.<br /><br />'Bastava' ('It was Enough') is about a bad breakup and will most likely end up being a huge hit for the singer. Upon first hearing it, I mistakenly thought she had written it with Tiziano Ferro, as its structure is something the other artist has made famous - nearly speaking through the verses, then with a huge rock chorus.<br /><br />'Inedito' ('Brand New'), is the most rocking song on the album, and is one I can't seem to stop listning to. A duet with Gianna Nannini, it is about a great relationship and is unlike anything we've seen from Laura so far. Where \\"Resta in Ascolto\\" was rock in a hard way, this takes the sound in a new direction.<br /><br />In addition to these four are other songs that have definite merit. While there is a certain feel to all of the songs, they don't run together. On this record, Pausini explores different chord progressions, rhythms, and song structures - and it works. Though I've been listening to this one pretty much for a month straight, I'm always finding something new to notice or appreciate. After all of the hype, \\"Inedito\\" delivers in a completely unexpected - and completely satisfying - way.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Shouldn't have to give it any stars. Not worth free.  Worst application I have ever seen.  Keeps locking up and reloading.
B000007S5B|4.0|I think this album is not the doors best, but it does have a lot of good songs. Including, Spanish Caravan, Love Street, The Unknown Soldier, and Five To One. This album does not compare to the L.A. Woman album which is my favorite Doors album. All though, This album is a good choice to buy if your looking for a good doors album. I would recommend getting it, but it's not their best.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this an old standard and great time waster. boss thinks I am taking notes. its nice to have an old school throw back.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Entertaining at times but the update messes it up and it never tells you how to play the games.Kind of a waste
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy is just amazing. The story is terrifying and draws you in immediately. None of it feels stretched, boring, or gimmicky, and you will probably find yourself reading through the whole thing very quickly (I couldn't put it down and I finished the trilogy within three days). The imagery leaves your own heart racing and you feel yourself almost in the place of the characters. I would definitely recommend.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|This album is easily, Thier best album. This album includes. Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers, Precious and Grace, and La Grange. Which i think make the album the best. Move Me On Down The Line is Stellar. I think this album is a must own for ZZ Top fans and also for Rock N Roll fans. If you decide to buy this album, You won't be disappointed.
B005TPCQ5I|3.0|I wanted to be a believer. I wanted to believe that obviously gorgeous Emma (Anne Hathaway) was an ugly duckling so insecure she'd be pitifully infatuated with smug, smirking playboy Dex. And that in spite of his Cad behavior, which is telegraphed, semaphored, and all but ridden in by Pony Express and flown by Goodyear Blimp throughout two-thirds of the movie, he is really a sweet guy underneath. And actually I could sort of believe it, because there can be a genuine good girl/bad boy dynamic in real life. These opposite types can be attracted to each other.  The problem is that it takes Emma and Dex so looo-ooo-ooong to overcome their individual weaknesses. Would somebody as bright as Emma really stay at her sombrero-wearing gig at a taco joint for years? Even after Emma finally gets a good haircut and a good job, she lives with pathetic wannabe-comedian boyfriend Ian seemingly FOREVER after she knows she'll never love him. Dex remains a womanizer and a selfish drunk into his thirties. The scene where he's chosen as \\"The Most Obnoxious Man On Television\\" is sort of winning, but how long do we want to follow the career of a man like this? The slackest scenes in the movie are the endless ones which show Dex as drunk, greasy and dishevelled.  Hathaway and Sturgess's acting skills save the movie. (By the way, Hathaway's English accent is perfectly O.K.) Inspite of ourselves, we get drawn into their individual metamorphoses--and yes, the chemistry between them is there. We can even believe that, at long last, Dex has grown into the man and father he was meant to be. And then there is the ending.  SPOILER ALERT.  The tragic ending seems, to me, completely gratuitous. The movie has (for the most part) a romantic-comedy structure, and it's more thoughtful than most. We've been led to care about these characters and to cheer when they finally achieve what they always should have had--a life together. A totally unheralded death which lays waste to everything they hoped for and finally reached comes as a meaninglessly cruel slap in the face. And yes, if this is the way the novel ended, it could and should have been rewritten.
0307891372|5.0|I am very glad I purchased this book. For the price it was a great means to explore more about the mechanics of the game that I did not totally understand...crafting, shrines, combat, leveling system...It also was able to clarify all the different mission catagories and made it a little more clear. I have not used this book to read through a mission and then play it...that would just spoil the fun. But there has been a couple times where I did not understand what had just happened. And then I referenced the mission guide in this book and reoriented myself. I still use online resources for alot of stuff too. But book professionally structures the information in a readable format, and it is fun to have a \\"Tome\\" of Skyrim in your own hands!
B004I744AS|5.0|I find this one very easy and fast to use; multiple uses; translates other languages; learning a lot with this free app.
0465022227|4.0|This book is filled with great advice for someone at any stage of a science graduate program.  Although much of it is specific to the last few years of a PhD/postdoc, I read it as an early-stage grad student and found it very useful.  I think it really helps me focus on the right stuff because I see where I'm heading and what skills I'll need in the future to have a fighting chance at a decent academic job.  My one gripe is that some of it really doesn't apply in my scientific discipline, and I wish that had been made more clear from the get-go.  For example, epidemiology doesn't really have \\"government labs\\" where people can just bypass the assistant professorship.  It's nice to recommend, but I don't think it's an option for most scientists.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone considering a PhD in any scientific field.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|Love it!  To all my friends who ask \\"is that the show were Malcoms dad cooks meth?\\" or \\"isn't that the druggie show like weeds?\\"  Answer NO!  the show is a damn good psychological thriller with some comedy and drama... Its not another Weeds. Its not about drugs (if ya ask me) Its about people... Breaking Bad.  Netflix has seasons 1-2-3 available but, season four (is the BEST) and its here on Amazon. I watched the first three on netflix but I ended up buying them from Amazon anyway, I want to own them.  Watch it.  M...
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Every Beatle fan must own this set. It is from another world. Jump into the Delorian and travel back and back to 1964 -- a truly remarkable era. Everybody is here, Ed, John, Paul, George. & Ringo and an amazing cast of characters ... 5 golden stars.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Just wanted to add my own recommendation for the sensational 2011 film 'Warrior'. This one has it all, tremendous action / fighting scenes, high energy and a profoundly poignant drama that will leave the viewer physically and emotionally drained. The production values, story-line and dialogue are top notch and the acting is strong and believable. Nick Nolte as the reformed alcoholic father and Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy as his emotionally tortured sons are unforgettable. In my estimation Nolte performance is worthy of a best supporting oscar nomination but even more amazing is the portrayal delivered by Tom Hardy. It gives me shivers just thinking about it.<br /><br />'Warrior' is a must see, must own film! My highest recommendation!!!
030788743X|5.0|What a great book to reminisce about the 80's!  Anyone who has even a little geek in them (no matter how hard they try to keep it hidden) will enjoy this book.  Dungeons & Dragons, Atari, movies by John Hughes, Def Leppard, it's all in there woven together by a clever story set in a very depressing future.  Although some parts got a little too geeky for me, usually during a thorough explaination of some geeky fact, I still wanted to read all night long to get to the end.  In my opinion, a book I don't want to stop reading is worth 5 stars.  If you have absolutely no inner geek you might still find this book interesting but probably not worthy of 5 stars.  Don't let the scifi genre scare you. The setting of the book is the near future and references are made to events taking place now (in addition to the 80's).  There's even some espionage elements to the story that make it very exciting.  It's a great twist on Charlie and Chocolate Factory crossed with science fiction.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I started watching Breaking Bad thinking it would be like \\"weeds\\".  I fell in LOVE with the characters.  I tell everyone \\"WATCH BREAKING BAD!\\" everyone always says;   \\"Isn't that the show about Malcom's dad cooking meth?\\"  Answer; NO. Its not about Malcolm's dad cooking meth, it's not about the drugs, the cartel, tweekers... It is about people and it is what I consider a good psychological thriller with some comedy and drama. The show is about Breaking Bad...  Watch it, its not about drugs,it's about people.  M...
B000002H38|5.0|I first heard of Anita Baker when she released \\"Sweet Love\\" in 1986, and I've loved ever her since. This is the rare perfect album where every song on it is great. Of course, I have my favorites, like \\"Sweet Love,\\" \\"Caught Up In the Rapture,\\" and \\"Same Ole Love.\\" But all of them are great. I've seen her twice in concert, and those were two of the best shows I've ever been to. Come back, Anita!
B003NFM3JK|1.0|I was sold a video by Go Hastings, i was told it was new. it was sent to me out of packaging,and when i went to play it skipped and froze many times. it took a long time to get a response about my concern. Anytime i see a Go Hastings sale i will be sure to  pass it by.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I have been wanting this screwdriver for ages, and it is more than I expected it to be! Mine, at least, is in perfect working order, although the force of gravity overcomes the lock on the extended position. I'm not sure if that's a design flaw or if it just wasn't supposed to stay up.  I was disappointed at first because it is advertised as making two different sounds. I assumed this meant one sound for the lower position and one for the upper, so when they sounded the same, I was disappointed. In reality, the two different sounds alternate--You press it once, you get a kind of overtone (I believe I heard it in The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances), and again for a plain old buzz.  Regardless, I was overjoyed at this product!!! The UV makes it look \\"otherworldly;\\" I'm glad a UV was used instead of a plain old blue LED. Also, unlike some other reviews, I was pleasantly surprised at how loud it was. Of course, no Earthly device can replicate the wonders of the Doctor's screwdriver, but this comes pretty close.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|yup... yup.. good... good...  I scene this first in theaters because, I couldn't wait.  This is not the traditional 1970's \\"Planet Of The Apes\\" style show, however the story was good. I liked it, the ending leeds into the (more traditional concepts behind the original) \\"Planet Of The Apes\\".  Have fun!  M...
B004EBUXI0|5.0|I used this processor for my first computer build and the difference in these intel chips definitely shows. My boot time is almost instant, especially since its paired with an SSD drive. You dont have to buy a separate graphics card since the chip has built in graphics. I would recommend this card to everyone seeking performance.
B0058VW36U|5.0|a really great game! many levels and achivements to unlock. great game to pass time when bored! mytouch 3g slide
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This is a lovely animated story about the time of life when children begin questioning the existence of Santa.<br />The movie is beautifully done. You almost can forget it is animated.  Tom Hanks plays a couple of roles, and he always adds a lot to anything he is a part of.<br />As the Polar Express makes it's stops, it picks up more children who are approaching adolescence and the age of doubt.  Children from all walks of life, rich and poor enter the train, for a great adventure to the North Pole.<br />This would be a nice movie to watch with the family while decorating the Christmas tree.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Since they updated the game it is good. I just hope that they can keep it as up to date in the future
B004KA9MQO|5.0|This album is so good and for so many reasons. One, her voice is electrying and she is singing like its her last time or something and two, after going through some things in her words, she is still ticking and for that, I salute her. This is one of my favorite soulful albums and it stays in rotation. My favorite songs are \\"No One Gonna Love You\\" (my absolute fav), \\"Angel\\", and \\"Don't Look Down\\"! I would love to see her perform this album live cause it is da bomb .com! A must have!!!!!!!!!
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This is my favorite movie of 2011 and my favorite sports movie of all-time! I saw the trailer to this movie around spring of 2011. My reaction was, 'This is probably gonna suck really bad when it comes out.' The more I watched the trailer, the more I couldn't help but find myself building up my anticipation to see it. I guess the reason why would be because I love movies and I love MMA! We all know most or all recent MMA movies suck and haven't really been taken too seriously due to the previous attempts like 'Never Back Down', 'Fighting'(Not sure if it's even considered an MMA movie, but might as well be.), 'Unrivaled', 'Undisputed' 2 & 3(Great action in these 2 flicks), 'Flashpoint', and 'Redbelt' which was pretty good and realistic but was more of a drama than an MMA or sports movie. Now 'Warrior' has all the elements to make it a great picture. It was one of those rare movies that had you expecting it to be really good even though something inside you said it might suck. Boy was I wrong and glad! Great story, great acting, great action, great music, and an awesome cast. Nick Nolte deserves an Oscar nomination for doing such an awesome job. I am officially a Tom Hardy fan now. Now the most important and favorite part of the movie for me was the conclusion before the credits. I haven't found myself seriously tearing up like that during or right after an action scene since 'T2' or 'Braveheart'. It was such a bittersweet ending when the song 'About Today' starts playing at the end when the brothers are fighting. I'm gonna stop here because I feel myself tearing up just thinking about that final scene in the movie as they're walking back to the locker room and the father is looking at them from a distance. WOW!!! It's almost impossible for me to believe that there will ever be a better MMA movie than 'Warrior'! Great job to director, Gavin O'Connor! Too bad I don't see the movie getting a Best Picture nomination due to the nature of the media and the public's reaction to MMA.n to MMA.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|The book was excellent! Cannot wait to get the movie. It was so well written I could not put it down. Stayed up late every night reading it.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|This dvd was definitely a hitter as are all her dvd's. My favorite performances were \\"Run The World\\", \\"Rather Die Young\\", and \\"End of Time\\". Beyonce is such a dynamic performer and everything she does, she puts more heart and soul in it. She is one of few artists who allows her fans to journey with her through her most memorable experiences and I, as a fan, appreciate that.<br />For some reason, I feel Beyonce was exceptionally emotional on this dvd as she is seen wiping tears on a few songs and just judging from past dvd performances, something was definitely on her mind. Just hope all was well because if not, she still knocked it out.<br />The only thing I would hope changes from here on out is the whole Destiny Child segment. I understand that those songs are apart of her story and are very dear to her but she has enough of her own songs to do a full blown out concert and it would still sell.<br /><br />So overall, I love this dvd and I keep it in rotation as I do the \\"I Am...Yours\\" dvd. Just can't help but love the best performer of our time!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works pretty good. Wish I could zoom in to street level. Overall, this seems to be a pretty good weather app.

0780683048|5.0|I added this movie to my grandson's special collection. It was an excellent copy, good quality and clarity. He had heard this movie was an impressive piece of Orson Welles' accomplishments, he was not dissappointed.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Over all this watch was what I was looking for. Simple design, light weight, day/date, and automatic movement. I buy automatic watches because I do not want to have to worry about winding a watch every day or replacing batteries. Unfortunately, this timepiece loses approximately 1 hour of time every few days. On every occasion, it has been over the course of one night while I have slept. I own other watches with swiss and japanese movements with no problems but I am finding that the malaysian movement is not up to the same standard.

0060555661|5.0|This is  a book that has been on my reading list for a while - as The reference in the investment field (from a fundamental analysis perspective). As Benjamin puts it in the introduction: \\"the purpose of this book is to supply, in a form suitable for the laymen, guidance in the adoption and execution of an investment policy.\\"<br /><br />The author makes it very clear from the beginning of the book (and throughout it) that his advice is addressed to investors and not speculators (see excerpts below). Within the investor class - he further makes a distinction between the \\"defensive\\" and \\"aggressive\\" investor as it relates to the time and energy intended to be spent on research/analysis and in conjunction the expected associated returns. Regardless of which class the investor belongs to, the main premise of the book revolves around value investing - buying securities when they are undervalued based on their fundamentals. Benjamin goes on to discuss a breadth of topics in the area of investing including inflation, market fluctuation, portfolio management, stock selection, convertible issues, bonds etc.<br /><br />Last but not least, the commentary by Jason Zweig, adds a more modern context and further explains the concepts presented by Graham. By reading both texts, the ideas and concepts are in definite reach of any reader.<br /><br />A must read for any investor, whether a beginner or pro. As an investor myself, I have found (as I am sure others have as well) that the perspective Benjamin brings is both timeless and very applicable.<br /><br />Below are excerpts summarizing some of the key investing principles outlined in the book:<br /><br />1) \\"1 - Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors. 2 - The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising industries.\\"<br /><br />2) \\"Note that investing, according to Graham, consists equally of three elements: a) you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of the underlying business, before you buy its stock; b) you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses; c) you must aspire to \\"adequate\\", not extraordinary, performance.<br /><br />3) \\"The more enthusiastic investors become about the  stock market in the log run, the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run.\\"<br /><br />4) \\"The only thing you can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that you will probably turn out to be wrong. The only indisputable truth that you will probably turn out to be wrong...And the corollary to that law of financial history is that the markets will most brutally surprise the very people who are most certain that their views about the future are right. Staying humble about your forecasting powers, as Graham did, will keep you from risking too much on a view of the future that may well turn out to be wrong.\\"<br /><br />5) \\"To obtain better than average investment results over a long pull requires a policy of selection or operation possessing a twofold merit: (1) It must meet objective or rational tests of underlying soundness and (2) it must be different from the policy followed by most investors or speculators.\\"<br /><br />6) \\"Investment policy, as it has been developed here, depends in the first place on a choice by the investor of either the defensive (passive) or aggressive (enterprising) role. the aggressive investor must have a considerable knowledge of security values - enough, in fact, to warrant viewing his security operations as equivalent to a business enterprise. There is no room in this philosophy for a middle ground, or a series of gradations, between the passive and aggressive status. Many, perhaps most, investors seek to place themselves in such an intermediate category; in our opinion that is a compromise that is more likely to produce disappointment than achievement.\\"<br /><br />7) \\"A great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for the stock.\\"<br /><br />8) \\"Those formulas (forecasting and trading) that gain adherents and importance do so because they have worked well over a period, or sometimes merely because they have been plausibly adapted to the statistical record of the past. But as their acceptance increases, their reliability tends to diminish.  This happens for two reasons: First, the passage of time brings new conditions which the old formula no longer fits. Second, in stock-market affairs the popularity of a trading theory has itself an influence on the market's behavior which detracts in the long run from its profit-making possibilities.\\"<br /><br />9) \\"Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal. At other times he will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies.\\"<br /><br />10) \\"The most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements. The speculator's primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor's primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices.<br /><br />11) \\"Which factors determine how much you should be willing to pay for a stock?...Graham feels that five elements are decisive. He summarizes them as: a) the company's \\"general long-term prospects\\" b) the quality of its management c) its financial strength and capital structure d) its dividend record e) and its current dividend rate. \\"<br /><br />12) \\"Nevertheless, the future itself can be approached in two different ways, which may be called the way of prediction (or projection) and the way of protection. Those who emphasize prediction will endeavor to anticipate fairly accurately just what the company will accomplish in future years...By contrast, those who emphasize protection are always especially concerned with the price of the issue at the time of study. Their main effort is to assure themselves of a substantial margin of indicated present value above the market price 0 which margin could absorb unfavorable developments in the future.\\"<br /><br />13) \\"No matter which techniques they use in picking stocks, successful investing professionals have two things in common: First, they are disciplined and consistent, refusing to change their approach even when its unfashionable. Second, they think a great deal about that they do and how to do it, but they pay very little attention to what the market is doing.\\"<br /><br />14) \\"Our preference for the analyst's work would be rather that he should seek the exceptional or minority cases in which he can form a reasonably confident judgement that the price is well below value. He should be able to do this work with sufficient expertness to produce satisfactory average results over the years.\\"<br /><br />15) \\"In the short run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.\\"<br /><br />16) \\"To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it looks.\\"<br /><br />17) \\"...the intelligent investor must focus not just on getting the analysis right. You must also ensure against loss if your analysis turns out to be wrong - as even the best analyses will be at least some of the time.\\"ny is not a great investment if you pay too much for the stock.\\"<br /><br />8) \\"Those formulas (forecasting and trading) that gain adherents and importance do so because they have worked well over a period, or sometimes merely because they have been plausibly adapted to the statistical record of the past.

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|The 2011 version of GWDT has more gloss and a better opening credit sequence, but aside from that, the 2009 version has better pacing, better scripting, and better casting. Take the central character, Lisbeth Salander, played by Rapace (2009) and Mara (2011)-Rapace nailed the character while Mara is only good. This is not meant to take away from Mara's acting-rather an indication that the script and directing in the 2009 version were better at bringing out the character of Lisbeth. Same could be said for the other characters-the scripting in the 2011 version just didn't develop the characters as well as the original version. Also Fincher made some changes that I don't think work as well-in the 2009 version, Mikael and Lisbeth investigate the old crime scenes together while in the 2011 version, Lisbeth investigates them by herself. Mikael is a noted investigative journalist; I could easily picture the police opening up their old case files to him, but not to a weird-looking Goth girl showing up and asking to see the files. The final change involving Harriet I also think worked better in the original.  For me, the original version is still the best one.
030788743X|5.0|If you spent any time in the 80's and liked the culture... especially the geek-out kinda culture... Then this is a MUST read.  As soon as I finished I was ready to start the book over, just to catch all the 80's references I may have missed, and to look the ones I had forgotten.  Very fun and super fast read!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Also, easy to use and a great way to pass the time. It's a great game to play while waiting for appointments, or waiting in line.
B005PTQPU0|3.0|As usual, Kate Bush is surprising--in this instance, in refusing to conform to expectations. No song on her new album seems intended to stand alone, but as part of a single musical vision, one more unified than Ariel, if less inventive. Her melodies still impress, even when her lyrics mystify. This isn't the Kate Bush familiar from the 1980s, but perhaps that shouldn't be expected in 2011.
B00632HWOG|5.0|the app is fully functional. everything works making it easy to check multiple yahoo mail accounts. I don't understand why people give bad reviews for this one?!?

B0001MDQ6W|5.0|Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of excellent content for the many electronic platforms currently available to those who appreciate music. I have only found 4 concert DVDs that capture the power of the artist. This DVD is one of them.  The other 3 are: Crosby, Stills & Nash - The Acoustic Concert; Roy Orbison - Black & White Night; and James Taylor - Live at the Beacon Theatre. Fortunately, someone had the foresight to capture this 1995 concert recorded at Sony Studios.  The colors, camera work, and lighting are the best I have seen on any concert DVD.  The DVD looks amazing on a modern flat screen TV.  The same goes for the excellent recording of the musicians.  They will be watching this DVD 100 years from now assuming civilizaton does not destroy itself before that time arrives.
030788743X|5.0|Let me say right off that I'm not a videogame enthusiast; not part of my generation. But I really enjoyed entering OASIS with the hero of this novel, Wade Watts, AKA Parzival (that's his game Avatar name). OASIS is the creation of a programming genius, James Halliday, who has made it into an entire universe with thousands of planets to explore. Parzival goes to online high school on one of these planets, Ludus. He's a very likable young fellow living in the fallen world of the future, oil crash and global collapse creating an urban poverty neatly imagined in the book. Like many others he escapes to OASIS much of the time. The creator of OASIS, now dead, has left behind the prize of all his wealth to whoever can solve the puzzles imbedded in OASIS, find the keys, open the gates and inherit his estate worth billions. It's great that the novel offers such a highly probable future; to my mind that's the basis for great science fiction. It spins the present off into a fantastic but believable future.  Not being a video gamer or enthusiast of 80's culture didn't block my enjoyment of this book. In fact, it was entertaining to find out about these worlds from the POV of Wade, who is obsessed with them because they hold the clues to finding the prize. The writing is high quality, engaging and keeps you reading.  Wade's friendships and relationships are interesting to the reader because they are really interesting to Wade (there's an awesome girl avatar). You can't help but root for Parzival/Wade because he hasn't got the riches and tools his other friends have, but does have a quick wit and lots of talent. Significant bad guys and difficult situations lurk in OASIS. It's a great quest/adventure.   James Cox, Author of U.R.B.

0316776963|1.0|Let me tell you the story of the actual physical copy of this book I borrowed from my stepmom, as it is actually quite a metaphor for how I feel about the content inside.  I was bored one day so I asked my stepmom if she had any good books I could read (this, perhaps, was my first mistake).  \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was one of the several books she offered.  From the reviews on the cover, Me Talk Pretty One Day seemed \\"wildly entertaining\\" and funny.  I brought the book to work to read on my downtime, but wound up (before I had a chance to start it) lending it to a coworker who needed it more than I did.  (My coworker had even more downtime.)  She got about fifty pages in, thought it was alright, but opted at that point to play Slingo on her phone.  She put Me Talk Pretty One Day in her purse where, later on, a bottle of water mysteriously opened up and poured onto the book, soaking it through.  Other more important and expensive items were in her purse and got ruined but she felt particularly bad about this book because it was not hers.  She thought it was mine.  She said she was sorry; told me she would replace it, but I told her not to worry, the book was actually not even mine but rather my stepmom's and I didn't really care.    I'm sure this only made her feel worse.    I told her we would see how the book dried, then determine whether or not a new copy was needed.  It dried in time with the aid of a space heater and, as it turned out, only the pages were slightly wrinkled and warped.  The text was okay so I figured the book was okay and my coworker needn't worry about replacing it.  It was at this point that I resumed possession and began to read it.  I too thought the book was alright- moderately entertaining and humorous- but ultimately pointless.  By the time I got to disliking it, my reason being the book is what I titled this review, I felt I had invested too much time to just stop and not complete the book.  So I kept reading, hoped the next story/essaywould be better than the last (they weren't), until the end.    When I finished, I brought the book outside, placed it into a used aluminum cooking tray, and lit it on fire.  The pages were too badly water-damaged to return to my stepmom anyway.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my 20 year old son, who had seen this movie in the theater. I hadn't seen it yet, but I thought it was a action packed take-off of the old comic books. The characters attach themselves to your imagination. Stanley Tucci is excellent as the scientist who realizes Captain America's value to the project.  Hugo Weaving is the very incarnation of the evil \\"bad guy\\".  Chris Evens makes the transition from \\"90 lb. weakling\\" to buff super hero almost believable.  This is a purchase you will like to have on hand in your DVD library for sure.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I got this cover for Christmas with my Kindle Fire. I had been looking at this cover for my K3. This case is beautiful and its eye catching. It caught my eye in Best Buy! My Kindle Fire fits right in, my faincee said he wasn't sure if it would fit as the tag on it does not say for the Kindle Fire. But he knew I had wanted that cover instead of the plain red one, the cities outlines make this one pop! The strapes seem to hold very well, they are tight so now worrying about losing the Fire. The cover closes without a problem. I did notice that when I got the cover how it was packaged did make it seem like their was a magnit. But once you get the Fire in its either covered or it was just the package. Over all I love this cover. Seems like it will last a good time!!
B000002KBU|5.0|I think there are some below who say this album lacks one certain thing or another.  Well, it's as if they are basically adolescent boys who lack an ear for anything musical. Any review less than five stars comes from those who are tone deaf and rhythmically challenged.  This is a bedrock point that is neither arguable nor open for further discussion.   One absurdity is some comment below speaking of the \\"sparseness of instrumentation.\\" That alone is instantly refuteable upon first hearing mountain dulcimer intro on \\"All I Want,\\" where one notices the follow-on entry of the bassline that plays outside of the initial tonic chord and provides an odd rhythm serving as transition to a seemingly different meter in much of the rest of the song.  Perhaps the listener who spoke of the \\"sparseness of instrumentation\\" was simply so overtaken by the overwhelming dynamics, range, and soul of Joni's subsequent vocal intro that he or she forgot the initial beauty that instrumental set up of the song.  At this point, I dare anyone to defy me as superior instrumental richness of this album--and I include albums like Led Zepplin IV or Dream Theater albums as a comparison, for instance.  Just because it's an acoustic set doesn't mean there isn't instrumentation (i.e., bluegrass, classical).  Of course the most compelling aspect of this album is the magnificent vocal performance that Joni delivers, but more on that in a bit.  Perhaps the only albums in rock that match up with \\"Blue\\" are \\"Exile on Main Street, \\"Pet Sounds*,\\" \\"The Beatles\\" [The White Album], \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"What's Going On.\\" So far, if you have to ask why, about anything in this discussion, give up listening to music.  One thing though, this album doesn't follow the rock form in the traditional electrified, distorted, rock beat, rock and roll way, but it still kicks them all to the middle of next week--even though it's kind of a folk album.   In returning to the vocal performance on this album, Joni wipes the mat of just about all of the diva's before her and after her, to this very day (including that 9 year old kid, or Adelle, or whoever else is vamping or has vamped over the same tedious 90's/21st century hip-hop R&B style.  Simon Cowell has yet to make a discovery that come's close to Joni.), except Billy Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn and Amy Winehouse (when there was no wine in her house.).  Am I angry.  Yes.  Mankind, except for Joni, Prince (note his nod to Joni on his song \\"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker\\"), me, and about 1500 other musicians (& about 4500 other listeners), has lost the ability to discriminate the beautiful and sublime from that which is otherwise.  Quite sad.  *Smile is notable as well, though remarkably underrated by the music press.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love that this isn't a timed, competitive game.  Relaxing, sometimes challenging, and fun puzzles with nice music and premise.
B005OK722U|1.0|I love the gritty feel of the first two movies. This movie was way too septic and clean. A bunch of wimpy rich people set at a table with a computer terminals and bid on how the torturer victimizes his victim. They don't even have the nerve to do it them selves. This movie was terrible. Unless Eli Roth comes back please let this be the last one.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|this game looks beast but my kindle fire is taking forever for it to load!! :(  but I'm still giving it a five star. but it looks beasty anywayzz :) :^)
B003G4W49C|5.0|I know nothing of Card as a person and quite frankly, as an aspiring writer myself, I don't care.  I consider it a motion of professional courtesy to not give a damn about who is marrying who and who is supporting which politician.  It gets me nowhere.  That said, he is one of my favorite authors.  I don't think its fair to judge a man's most personal self and his most secret dreams (which, for most writers I know, is the case with their writing) based on the persona he projects to the world.  It seems to me that a person is capable of doing one thing while dreaming of another.  I certainly do.  (See the 1-star reviews for the explanation of that rant.)<br /><br />I loved this book.  I haven't read the rest of the series yet, nor have the Kindle version, so can't say anything there, but the story was great and the world Card created was fantastic!  The detail of the mock battles was incredible.  I can easily see it in my head.  The only thing I have to complain of is that the ending seems to come a little too easily to me but at the same token, these are a vastly different people than we are and perhaps I missed some explanation in the text.<br /><br />Another good Card one is \\"Maps in a Mirror.\\"  Its a collection of his short fiction.  Some of my favorite stories are in this book!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|entertaining great for my eight year old he and I both have both enjoyed playing it and we are looking forward to unlocking all the games would be five star but the ads are way to frequent!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|If you love Joss Whedon and his witty humor you probably should stop reading this review and just buy the DVD/BR.  I didn't know much from Mr. Whedon (I knew he made Buffy back in the day, but I didn't really watch it.)  Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog is a great show case of talent and great dialogue.  Imagine a super hero story told from the point of view of the villain, (who's alter ego is a quite guy who can't get the courage to talk to a girl at his local launder mat.)  What follows is a very entertaining short film with great characters & GREAT writing and music.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|It followed much along the same lines as the first book and was still pretty good. I feel i would not have enjoyed it as much if i hadn't read the first Hunger Games book. Or perhaps i would have enjoyed it more as all the concepts would have been new and the story line was very similar therefore lacked a lot of the excitement from the first book until it's second half.
B005K17RU0|5.0|easy to use. lots of info. love the 15-day span. using it on my fire. it does stay running in the background, but I don't have a problem with that because I love having immediate access.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Tween novelist'S need to pull their socks up and take notes because this is how it should be done. I am in my mid 20's and i still found this book enjoyable. It was well written with a refreshingly new concept. I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
1426308469|5.0|Got this for my 4 year old that is obsessed with dinosaurs. It is an awesome learning book, but they make it fun to.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|This book was a good realistic finish to a great trilogy. Perhaps at times a bit too realistic and slow paced. A most read ONLY if you have read book one and two.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this game because you can get free ponits and you cant just play any game you have to earn the games and also some of the games are pretty hard too.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Cory Trese does it again. Star Traders Elite is an amazing game with tons of options to keep you playing. The ships, the professions, and the factions are all different and cater to very different playstyles. Being a Bounty Hunter will lead to different situations and combat than a Spy, for example.  In summary the game is well worth the cost. There's plenty of content and constant updates to keep you going.
0061719544|5.0|just like everyone else says, it's a great book for fergy fans.  his other book was difficult to read, i couldn't get half-way thru it.  entirely different writing styles in the two books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an excellent app. I really enjoy playing the games. you can never get bored on this app... love it love it love it
B005V20JKI|5.0|I love this game. I got it on my Kindle Fire as the free App of the day on the Amazon Appstore and have racked up countless hours on it. I was really excited when I heard they were going to update it with two new levels at Christmas time. I had finished the game four times, upgrading all the characters, getting all the perks and lives and could not wait to play with the new content. So I was pretty disappointed when I discovered, through the Muffin Knight facebook page, that the version I had gotten was not going to be updatable. This is what Muffin Knight had to say: \\"We can't release the latest update on the Amazon Appstore yet, as it requires some features which are only present/allowed on the Android Market. I'm glad you are enjoying the game, but you'll have to wait until Amazon integrates In-App purchases, or you could get the game on the Android Market.\\" This was greeted by a lot of general discontent, because if you buy the game on the Android store you lose all your progress. So now I have two choices: buy the game on the Android market and start it all over again, or stop playing. Also, there is a new January update coming soon. So...buy the game, but not on the Amazon Appstore for until they resolve the issue!

0545265355|5.0|First, I can't believe people actually compared this to the Twilight Series. With all due respect, it's much better written, the story is way more interesting and you're spared of the annoying teens (with no real problem in life) and the whole shinny (i still didn't get over that) vampire drama.   From the moment I started reading, I could not put them down one after the other. It took me a day to read each book (good thing I started on a friday and, yes there are several things wrong with me). I simply fell in love with the story. It's pretty simple but so catching and Collins created such great characters. The story broke my heart several times, specially on Mockingjay, but I'm glad for every page. It's good either way for teens or adults. I guess a bit too heavy for children.  Katniss is a great hero, because she's not perfect, she's scared and just trying to survive, even though she is very brave. And though her life has made her hard and hopeless, she's got all that sweetness of a girl who really had to grow up way too fast with no one to look after her. So I love to see that she still lets herself be vulnerable, to admit she needs people. It's also why I like the whole love triangle with Peeta and Gale. There's next to no drama, just Katniss trying to figure out how she feels even when the reader already figured it out (I think). I also really liked that fact that Collins is able bring a world of a lot of sorrow, but with small hints of happiness and fun along the way. When I finished the books, it was just how I wanted it to end, but still it made me a bit sad. I suppose it's good to read something that reminds you that sometimes, things don't work out. Somethings you can't fix and are just part of live. But that life does go on and it's up to you to the best you can. Still, I had a lof of fun reading it and I'm really looking forward for the first movie to hit the theaters. I hope it'll be as awesome as the book.   By the way, I loved this box. The books arebeautiful and the pack is also nice because it's a pretty hard cardboard I suppose that does not rip easily. I hate it when I take one book and the whole thing just falls appart. It won't happen with this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works as intended. Easy to purchase via amazon prime. Plays nice on my new kindle fire. Now I just need to get the kindle back from my wife.
1423140591|4.0|I was so happy when I realized Riordan had decided to bring Percy back. I do miss him telling the story as in the previous books but that's just personal attachment to his personality which I love, I suppose. I thought maybe things would be a bit dull and that there was nothing left to say after the Olympian Series was done. Gladly I was wrong. I'm really curious about the next books and how things are going to turn out.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Purchsed the Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-IV on Blue-ray) Excellent video, my son-in-law was very happy to receive this for Christmas.  I am now his favorite mother-in-law.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it all the time.  It's great for shopping lists, to do lists, and things of that nature.  Not to mention being able to do full documents on the run.  The ability to share with people is nice too.  I make chore lists for my kids and just share the note to them.  then they can't say they didn't know.  :-)
B003L77G6A|5.0|If you have not seen the Big Bang Theory, what's your problem?  This has got to be the funniest show on TV.  It's NERDS vs One Hot Chick.  What more can I say?  Do you need a little off the top?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game I just wish some of the games didn't take so many points.  the app works better on the iphone than on.a droid.
1451627289|5.0|Don't start reading this book unless you have lots of time.  Starting off strong, it becomes more compelling with each page.  Anyone who lived this time period will experience lots of nostalgia, especially as you travel from the \\"Land of Ago\\" to the \\"Land of Ahead\\" in this spellbinding read.  Lots of details and descriptions of actual events make this book one of those must-reads.  The story unfolds in such a believable way that the reader must wonder if there are any really rabbit holes; if so what would you do if you fell in one?
B004IFYMYI|4.0|The product arrived fast. The picture quility was awesome, and I loved the extra stuff that cme with the blu ray movie.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|This is an incredible little GREAT device. I just bought a Bose headphone for my flight trips and I felt that I ws not getting all I could from them because my little IPOD does not have the capacity to deliver great capabilities.  Well, this device is just great, I can enjoy my music without having t turn on all the volume.  The only CON is that you can use this only when you are seating or not moving. Its not a great option yet for walking (but the design is to allow that).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion Bible App is definitely worth downloading. With it, you have access to many versions of the Scriptures. Of these, the vast majority can be downloaded to your device. You are also given access to wonderful study tools. I highly recommend this for students of the Bible.
B005FVA63A|5.0|Of course this box is overpriced. I've spent almost a month deciding if I was going to get it. And I eventually got the opportunity and the money, so don't get it if you can't afford it, 95% of U2 fans would be alright with the Super Deluxe one, which has got exactly the same content in terms of songs, videos and Anton Corbijn photographs. Get it if you can, if you want to make an impulse buy for a record you've spent all your youth listening to, that's what this edition is for. It's a piece of U2 history in a box. It's got everything that matters about the sounds and the visuals of the Zoo TV period, same for the Super Deluxe version in that regard. The album, the b sides, the remixes which are so important to that era of U2,  some unreleased stuff, the unfinished versions, Zooropa, the videos, tons of Zoo TV stuff. You may have a lot of it already. Personally, even though I've been a U2 fan since 1987, I only had some, and even fewer in digital format. So I just had a blast listening and watching all of this.  And this edition has the feel as well. You can arrange the tiles on the cover, you can wear the Fly glasses, you can listen to One on a clear vinyl 45, you can read a fac simile of a Propaganda magazine. It's all completely futile, and definitely not worth that price, heck, it's worth no price, who's ever needed Fly glasses ? But if you have the money, and if it doesn't prevent you from buying something useful instead, just go for it. If not, settle for the Super Deluxe (if you can still find it) or even with the Deluxe one which is still a good buy with a handful of nice b sides and remixes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it I'm very competitive so it keeps me playing til I win so it passes by time for me a lot I so love this app:)
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|If you own a 3D TV and you don't have this movie, then get it.  The technical aspects are like sitting in a movie theater.  The price was reasonable and the service was great.
1451627289|5.0|Excellent book - it stays with you. It was probably longer than it needed to be, but the pages flew - I couldn't wait to get to the end and then was sorry I had, not that there was anything wrong with the end, I would just miss the adventure! I thought about the premise and refleced on my own life and how it would turn if I had the same opportunity as the protagonist. Intriguing. A good read and great adventure. Well written.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Excellent service and quality. The price was very reasonable.  Love the fact that it operates as Blu-ray, and 3-D and has  a digital copy for the amount charged.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Tons of bible reading plans, bookmarking, public and private notes, social share features, plan reminders, accountability options, tons of other customization, easy interface, and more versions of the bible than you knew existed (many of which can be downloaded to your device if you want). Oh, and totally free with no ads. What else could you want? Seriously, try this app out. I wish they were all this good.
B001IAO2ZK|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted.  I have been wanting to get this for my daughter.  Great condition overall of case and disc and thanks.
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|Very good movie for all the family, including teenagers who, even if it is sometimes childish and predictable, like being brought into this fantasy world.  Of course this isn't the original stories written by Peyo, but the movie is well done.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I was disappointed when it arrived with the box crushed due to poor packaging-it was just wrapped in paper. However, poor packaging was not responsible for the wear spots on an item discribed as \\"like new\\". My real disappointment came when the DVDs didn't even work. Not much of a Xmas gift for my niece. I am VERY disappointed in the whole transaction
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excellent app!! I use it on all of my electronic devices from my computers, kindle, and phone without ever any dunging issues. I have used many different apps in the past and this is the best so far. I highly recommend this app for all of your organization and list needs.
B00009RDGA|5.0|This movie was purchased for a Christmas gift.  My daughter was very satisfied with the movie.  The quality was good and it came in good time.  I did not realize that the movie was a previously viewed movie.  There did not seem to be any problems with it.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I couldn't believe the cheap price, and it arrived quickly.  Love to have blu-ray of this DVD and didn't want to spend a lot. Thanks for a terrific gift idea.
1466268662|4.0|It is always odd to look back at beginnings. No one, surely not Agatha Christie herslf, could have guessed what a long run Hercules Poirot would have. He was already of a certain age when he took the stage in The Mysterious Affair at Styles.<br /><br />When she wrote this book Christie was still acquiring her voice and her main characters, Hastings and Poirot had not yet developed into the full formed personages they were to become.<br /><br />Nonetheless, The Mysterious affairs at Styles would be a perfect introduction to someone about to embark upon The cannon of A. Christie and it is a treat to go back and read it again now that I have read all that I can find of her work. Christie was my light reading while completing my M.A. and remains a fond favourite. Not all of Christie's books are great tales. This one is. See also my comments on The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.<br /><br />N.B. I want to make it clear that I am commenting on the story, not the binding or production values of this edition.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|have this game on kindle. woo much fun. cant wait till more games come out for this. good bye for now
1419701533|5.0|Very nice set. Good for early readers and the movies & animated shows are a plus! My kids like the show but really love the books!
B001HN690O|5.0|Since there are such long reviews I'll make this pretty short.  I thought the first one was pretty good, not comparable to some Pixar films, but still good.  The sequel goes another level in terms of story, action, animation quality and humor.  The writers flesh out more about Po and it's pretty heartwarming especially between him and his father.  Although only Po and Tigress relationship is touched on there's enough development to be interesting.  Gary Oldman does a great villian and the character is well written.  Action is bolder and the humor is great.  Sometimes onliners come off very corny or predictable, but these were well timed and witty.    1 flaw: the ending... a little quirky.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My two year old son LOVES this movie.  we watch it a least once a day.  The best part is that it is such a cute movie with great music that I don't mind watching it over and over and over again.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|Challenging and addictive. This game will have you on edge by level 5 as you try to keep up with the colors directional placement. Works well on my Kindle fire. 5 stars fun game and it was free.
0395389496|5.0|This was a great book! I loved that it included the CD for the kids to listen to. I did not realize that it came with a CD when I ordered it. Thank you for shipping it so quickly!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was looking for a Kindle Fire case that wouldn't be thick and bulky, and this one ended up being just perfect.  The material is thin but tough, and I feel that it protects the device very well.<br /><br />With all of the other negative reviews about the stand, I expected to just not use it at all.  As it turns out, though, I have found the stand to work very well!  I can thump the device pretty hard without it falling over, and I've ended up using the stand pretty frequently in the end.<br /><br />I'm perfectly happy with this case!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some challenging games on here!!!! enjoiy playing very much! it is a good time waster! my kid beats my score a lot!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|i really enjoy this app.very fun to play when bored at work.seems real at times.A ++.hope others enjoy too.
0439023521|5.0|This book (and the rest) are absolutely splendid. I couldn't stop reading it, I read it all the way through to the end in 2 days, and when I was done I couldn't wait to get the next one. I bought both Catching Fire and Mockingjay at the same time so I wouldn't have to wait 'til the order came in. I am about 72% done Mockingjay and am starting to seach for similiar books. I haven' found one that catches my eye as much as this did. I haven't found one that make me turn the page. I haven't found one so well-written. I may have to get my brain washed by the Capitol and read them again. Thank you Suzanne Collins for a such unique and interesting page-turner book.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|The microphone with headphones a reasonable option for patients with mild hearing impairment. The price is good for the device. Other professional products were over $100.
B005HSL626|4.0|it's kewl and a bunch of stuff like that and I'm just doing this for the halabit and I am actually veryf***Inge bored so yeah
0385738773|5.0|Some people say that this book has no answers in it.  Some people say that the plot had no point.  NONE of this is true.  In the book, you find out about the Flare, what it is, why it was released.  You find out what WICKED was, why they were so determined, what their goals were, and why they had the trials.  You got to look into Thomas' past, learning why he did what he did, and then realizing slowly, WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG.  It has a great plot, a fast-paced storyline, good humor, and many great lessons.  You learn that when in control, things sem different than when you're the one who suffers.  You learn about sacrifice, and the price of happiness.  This book teaches a lot.  And I think the reason people complain about not having enough answers is because, as the saying goes, every answer leads to another hundred questions.  Reading this series, understanding it, is one of the greatest things I think you could do with your time.  And I hope that, just like me, you will finish this book a new person, a little bit better, a little bit more empathetic.  Sure, you might think, so-and-so shouldn't have died, or maybe he should have trusted this person, but, in the end, it was a great book, and while not exactly a fairy tale ending, it is still better than anything someone else could have come up with, and if you want, yo can always write your own ending.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Fast and easy. Item shipped just as described and arrived really fast. I would do business with them again. I would highly recommend them.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Entertaining with cool special effects. I was rooting for the apes and really felt for Ceasar and his desire to find his place in the world. I hope there is a sequel. There is some violence but it is not as bad as most movies these days. I love James Franco too! It is a thrilling, sci-fi, popcorn munching movie with a main character who fights back! Go apes!
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|This is the first book in an terrific trilogy.  All of the Fuentes brothers are amazing.  You cannot put these books down. When I bought each book, I read them that day.  I needed to know what happened next and when it ended, I was sad because I wanted to keep reading.  Elkeles other books Leaving Paradise and Return to Paradise are equally addicive.  BUY THIS BOOK. You will not regret it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|First off, the touch drawing is very responsive and really does follow exactly where your finger goes. The amount of content blows me away. this could easily be a $5 app. My daughter absolutely loves it. she is trying to take my Fire out of my hand as I type this to use this very app.  between paper types, stickers, and all of the tools and colors this is really a must own app.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I'll start this review by mentioning a small detail about me that I think is important to this review.  I am a huge baseball fan.  As I said in my Review title, if you aren't a baseball person in the least, you will most likely not enjoy this movie and you could stop reading here.  For all others, here goes..  Moneyball is based of of a book which explains how Baseball has become a business.  A business in which the richest teams always have the upper hand over teams that never had deep enough pockets to afford the best players on the market.  This is a true story, which to my surprise was extremely well-told through movie adaptation.    Quick Plot Rundown: This is the story of Billy Beane (Pitt), who is the GM of the Oakland Athletics, a team which is pretty self-explanatory for baseball fans (no offense, A's fans).  He takes Peter Brand (Hill) under his wing and goes a different route to create a winning team with very little money - by way of finding cheap players with specific stats that are the most important to winning baseball games.  Basically, its a team of average joe's, some not even average.    The movie in my opinion was fantastic, but I know for sure that it will not be for everyone.  Brad Pitt's performance was great, and Jonah Hill really surprised me with how awesome he played his character.  The movie is a bit long (133 min.) and does have it's slow moments, but it also has moments that had the whole theatre laughing when I had gone to see it.  It was a nice balance of serious and humorous.    My Bottom line is if you know about the politics of baseball, and want to know how some of the most unlikely teams became champions, you should check this movie out.  However, the bigger a baseball fan you are, the more you will appreciate this movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|Interesting and useful app for your device,also amusing for word games and learning about words.Most of all it is free and available all the time...
B004ECDNJU|5.0|Turns my phone off pretty regularly, but its actually a pretty fun game. I'm actually debating wether or not to play it again, knowing full well that the odds of my phone shutting off are pretty high.  Enjoy!
B005I6EVUG|1.0|The cover seems well made and is very attractive. It closes and stays closed very well with the 'mock kindle insert' it arrives with. However, it will not stay closed when actual kindle is in place! To me, the reason to use a cover at all is to protect my kindle fire, and using a case that won't close seems rather pointless. Returning this product, which is a shame because it is otherwise lovely.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love this game!  Only complaint is that the cards don't always go to the place where I put them. Can be frustrating. (Might be a bit of User error, too.)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is just a fun game to pass the time nor people should play its free and fun so why not get it and play it
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell Reflect is the perfect sequel to Quell. Great well balanced and reasonably challenging puzzles, nice graphics and very stable. Lots of fun for not even $1.
1451627289|5.0|I've never been a Stephen King fan but the subject matter of this novel intrigued me.  Having been married in 1958 I was very familiar with the time period he describes so perfectly, and of course, the Kennedy assassination was a huge event in my life.  I never expected to become so involved with the characters in this novel and was surprised at the number of times I was brought to tears by the emotions and situations described.  This is NOT the usual frightening, horror novel I expected from Stephen King.  It is a work of art and of history!  BRAVO!
B005HSL626|5.0|this app is awesome. as far as free apps go this is without question one of the most enjoyable apps ever.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is the absolute must have app for your phone or tablet.  A great way to organize the clutter of apps so you don't forget what you have and you can locate apps fast and easy. This is worth the price.
1451626657|5.0|NOTE: The first version I read was published in the 1960's and my current copy is from 1976.<br /><br />About the book:<br />This is a satire about war, about bureaucracy, about the disinterested, uniformed, unintelligent men (and women) who end up in charge, and about the people caught in the horror of all of it. The story loosely follows airman Yossarian as he navigates the terrors of war and the horror of those who control his life. There is a large cast of memorable characters who often unwittingly, but at times on purpose, influence the life of Yossarian as he tries to save himself from being killed in the war.<br /><br />The book is not told in a linear time fashion, so a reader can get lost as the stories move forward and back over various events. The chapters tend to be character sketches, which take us through events only to have them repeated in another sketch through different eyes.<br /><br />My take:<br /><br /> I didn't immediately fall into the book. It took me time to realize how time flow was presented. Remember, I was only 15 or 16 when I read the book. I had not come across a nonlinear book before. Once I understood the presentation, I was hooked.<br /><br /> I had enough experience in life to understand what Heller was trying to get across, though I hadn't any experience with satire. Those days were the middle days of the Viet Nam war, giving me additional insight to the book.<br /><br />Much of the humor is subtle while most of it is over the top, in your face. For instance part of a sentence in the book reads \\"Chief White Halfoat was transferred out of Colorado at the first rumor of oil...\\" which is buried in an explanation of how Halfoat came to be with the squadron. While another part of the book contains conversations that sound like the Abbot and Costello routine of `Who's on First'.<br /><br />Memorable scenes for me included Orr tinkering with the stove `faucet', Milo and his chocolate covered cotton, the dead man that wasn't dead, and the most haunting was when Yossarian treated Snowden for the wrong wound. In fact, Snowden remained with me for decades in much the same way he stayed with Yossarian throughout the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who understands satire and has had experience dealing with bureaucracy. I will say this is not a simple or easy read but the gems are fascinating. For many of us, this book is laugh out loud funny.fact, Snowden remained with me for decades in much the same way he stayed with Yossarian throughout the book.

B005K17RU0|1.0|My husband was looking for an app which provided an up to date and live in motion radar due to his job. We downloaded this one and as soon as we put the radar in motion, it froze our new Kindle Fire, and since the battery was fully charged, we had to wait 4 hours for it to die, hoping once it did, we could uninstall it and it would fix it. Luckily it did.. I was starting to worry there for a little while. Reading everyone else's reviews, I'm not sure why this happened, but just beware of this before installing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a cool and fun app.you get 117 games in just one easy download.I recommend this for everyone.I like it and I know you will.
B0061S073A|5.0|works great for three year old grandson.  he truly enjoys playing the games. we have placed on the app for him
B00457WZEI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story was well written. My only complaint was that it just seemed to cut off abruptly at the end. It was pretty short.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app offers a lot of options to help you study your Bible. The number of translations and the schedules make this app a must have.
0143038419|3.0|I was a little disapointed in this book. I loved \\"Eat\\", liked \\"Pray\\", and had to force myself to read through \\"love\\". The story was great and there were asepcts of each part that I loved. However, as a whole, I felt it didn't live up to all the hype and positive reviews and comments.
B004LROUW2|2.0|Writers are allowed to write messy and have it cleaned up, and I certainly would rank several of Murakami's novels in my top 10 favorite books of all time, but one of the following things happened here that resulted in some bad novel mechanics and a less than enjoyable experience as a reader:  1) the writing may have been not as strong as the author's past novels  2) the editor wasn't great and should have cut at least 50% of this to leave behind the mystery and delight and thinking that usually come with Murakami's novels  3) the translator may not have been great  Or some combination of those items, it's hard to tell which but the result is that you have a novel with an interesting plot, but with WAY too much detail, WAY too much insight into the character's internal thoughts, WAY too much repetition that aren't specific motifs but are just drilling a lesson into the reader's head.   The result is that you are treated as a lazy, incompetent reader. Nobody really enjoys or appreciates being treated as such.  Hope the next one is better, wish I had not wasted all that time on this one, I could have done without it.
0545265355|5.0|They shipped fast and were a great deal. I purchased them as a Christmas gift for my mom and she loves them. Nice set of books for cheap.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|So utterly original it took my breath away almost every page. I loved it, certainly one of my top 10 books of all time!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|I bought this book on sale due to the tremendous reviews. I'm a dog owner and thought I'd relate to the storyline well. While it is an interesting book, I thought it left something to be desired. It was hard to follow at times and some of the content seemed irrelevant. The beginning and end were good, but the middle drug on.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|If you read the book and even if you didn't, this movie is wonderful. Lots of entertainment and a wake up call for things that need changed in our country. Makes you think.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I loved \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\". It is an easy and light read. It was fun, entertaining, engaging, romantic, and a page turner.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|Let me first say that I have never watched a Woody Allen film to date. This is my first, and I must say that I am impressed! It was nice to watch a film with witty dialogue and to see such good character development. This is not your average brainless romantic comedy. It's smart, thought-provoking, and beautifully rendered. It's also simply delightful to watch! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I really like this cover. Stylish and all fit neatly in my purse. Have had it a month and is wearing well. I use my fire daily and was glad that this cover is holding up under my pressure.<br /><br />Sad to say that I can no longer use this beautiful cover now that I've upgraded to the Fire HD... the new Fire doesn't fit inside the case as the old Fire did. Still in GREAT shape after all the daily use and travel. Still a great case!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Very intuitive solitaire game.  Double click cards to move them to available spots.  No issue selecting &quot;inside&quot; cards.  Highly recommend this game.
B004LUS390|2.0|on kindle I could not draw or do anything but when I did, it was horrible. do NOT buy this app on kindle fire!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun yo play. Definitely addictive and challenging.  Hopefully helps to work my brain and stimulate development of brain cells.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|I couldn't get it to work as I had hoped on my EVO 4G.  It will charge the device thereby freeing up a cigarette charger if needed.  Perhaps I don't have the compliant software on the EVO to work interactively.  My rating is based on the construction of the product.  Seems sturdy, good design, tips fit snugly into MDI socket, etc.  Delivered fast and packaged well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games! fun for everyone! my 4 year old and my mom both love this app! makes it even better that it is totally free! having to earn points to unlock more games makes you never want to stop playing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is kind of fun, my son loves it, he cant get enough. its kid friendly so that's really good thanks
