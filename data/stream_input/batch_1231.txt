B004HEXSLI|5.0|This book is MUST reading for anyone helping to care for anyone with a brain injury, including doctors, nurses and family.  It is a fascinating depiction of what happens during a stroke but most importantly, what the person having the stroke is experiencing.  This information should be invaluable to the medical team treaing the patient as well as the family, and is useful not just for stroke victims but for any type of brain injury.  My elderly father had a subdural hemotoma and my only regret was not finding this book sooner.
B003L77GRO|5.0|About a month ago, I purchased Dexter: Season 5. I honestly thought it was one of the better Dexter seasons. Julia Styles actually had a larger role in this season than I thought she would. It's interesting to see Dexter really in love when comparing his relationship with deceased wife, Rita.<br /><br />Season 4 really ended on a cliffhanger when Rita was found dead in the bathtub as a victim of the Trinity killer. I was really interested in what season 5 would bring and it did not disappoint. I would recommend seeing this season. Thanks for reading.
B0000029AL|5.0|This album still is one of the finest debuts by a seventies band.  Specifically DREAM ON.....WALKING THE DOG...MAMA KIN.....The  Tyler/ Perry vibe started with this one......Check out Night In The Ruts too~~~
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Season 4 has a slightly different feel to it; but that is because the plot has brought out some nasty things in the character development.  A comment to a different reviewer...of course the wedding was tacky they are bikers!!!  What else would they do?  The show continues to hold the appalled eye of the viewers as the SOA continue to kill and maim and double cross.  Great fun.
B00555Z2PS|5.0|FOUR INCREDIBLE SIDES OF CLASSIC YES....RICK WAKEMAN, STEVE HOWE, CHRIS SQUIRE, JON ANDERSON and ALAN WHITE.  THE FINE ROGER DEAN GATEFOLD ART....MAKES THIS AN ENJOYABLE LISTEN....
B000001BZT|4.0|First half is better than the second half, but overall a very good album. A must for any Steve Earle collection. Go see him in concert if you ever get the chance. Fantastic!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|These are not the movies that I saw as a child.  These are not the movies that I grew up with and sparked my love of Sci-Fi. These are not the movies that won Academy Awards.  These are not those movies, those have been changed and are now something else.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|One of the best I've used.works great for baby monitor to o. Now with audio,its even better.keep up the good work.
0143115014|5.0|I purchased \\"Perfumes\\" and intended to use it as a guide; not as a bible. According to many textbooks, scientists still don't know how exactly olfactory memory works, therefore I cannot imagine someone having the most \\"correct\\" about this huge collection of fragrances created with an intention to evoke emotions, memories and fantasies. Yet some of the reviews are very informative providing names of the designers for easy search and what I especially like: authors' comparison between perfumes helps to form perception.<br />The reviews in this book pleased me with humor and very descriptive language. Even negative ones were not completely negative simply because they provided just the information I needed. They guided me in a right direction because I know what I like in a perfume. This book is such a good addition to my olfactory memory!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Ordered around 6-7 times from Amazon..and never been disappointed.  The movie itself is very entertaining. Bravo to James and Michael, such fantastic actors. Now waiting for Star Wars Ori Trilogy and Green Lantern blu-rays!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautifully crafted, with elegant puzzles, a nice learning curve, and simple gameplay. I love the ideal move feature; it's a nice extra challenge to try to find the perfect minimal solution.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It is what it is... and more.  I was expecting it to just be the disks with a few extra features, but everything from the packaging to the hours of extras on the three bonus disks is great.<br /><br />You can't go wrong buying this set.  I get that some people want the origionals, but it isn't what the creator wants.  The computer additions make the movies what he origionally invisioned and couldn't make happen.  Shut up and enjoy a masterpiece or go watch Star Treck.<br /><br />Enjoy, folks.
0553582038|5.0|This is the fourth in the Fire and Ice series. It is a bit disappointing as it leaves the main stream story line to pick up the secondary and back ground fabric of the story so I found it a bit slower going but it is also very informative and cements together many missing pieces to the story. It was a bold decision on Martins but in the end a good call.  dealer fast and highly recommended
B0028R3NCU|4.0|I bought one of these to use as a key-chain flash drive. Basically, this thing is not nearly durable enough to serve such a purpose. It took about 3 months for it to poop out.<br /><br />It's made up of 3 pieces, it has a plastic case, a metal sleeve, and a circuit board with contacts for the card and for usb. The board is what ended up failing in mine. Best I could tell is that it was a component or board failure and not a contact failure.<br /><br />I am, however, buying another one. I'm an android phone user so I deal with micro SDHC a lot. This is an incredibly convenient card reader (just don't lose it!)
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This was a refurbished or open box purchase. It didn't have a box but all the components were there and it works exactly as it should. There are 2 in the house now (this being the second) so I have the perfect opportunity for comparison. These can be a bit tedious to set up but they are great once they are for games like Magicka  especially. I mean ones that require multiple key combos to pull off a skill. In that way they can't be beat. Also as just a play pad they are fantastic. the ergonomic design is really nice and the w,a,s,d keys have more indention so that you can easily find home position even in the dark. I highly recommend these key pads to gamers of more than a casual interest.    Shipping was no only fast it was well ahead of estimated time. The dealer even sent me an email to be sure I was happy with the purchase! Good dealer to deal with and trust.
0345337581|3.0|Changing countries is always a memory challenge. Lots of new impressions combined with a new language, or just words that are unfamiliar. Moving to the US from Stockholm, i was surprised by my inability to remember people names, especially those I had not heard before. So I decided to do something about it.<br /><br />The memory book includes all of the tyoical tricks such as visualization and linking. And it works. To my understanding the book is one of the classics on Memory, but in my opinion classic is not always better. The book is written in an old language, and is not optimized for quick learning. It goes on and on about things that are pretty self explanatory. Next time I'll pick up something newer, that draws on the wisdom in this book and others, but presents it in a fun and readable manner.<br /><br />Not a waste, but not a winner.
0553381687|5.0|this is the first of the Fire and Ice series and I have to say a GREAT READ. George RR Martin is a good writer one of the best in the fantasy genre. I highly recommend the books.<br />Dealer is quick and sends what you ordered I also recommend them.
B004LWZW42|3.0|\\"X-Men: First Class\\" is a prequel to the X-Men film trilogy that takes us back to the founding of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, the first meeting of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr AKA Magneto, and revelation of mutants to the human race. This is accomplished through a re-imagining of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. The CIA's agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovers that genetically mutated humans may have some role in a plot to manipulate Cold War politics. She seeks out an expert in genetic mutation, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), at Oxford University. MacTaggert's experiences plus Xavier's unique talents force the CIA to admit that mutants exist. The man they are after is a Nazi war criminal going by the name Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon).<br /><br />A mutant himself, Shaw is playing the United States and Soviet Union against one another in order to incite a nuclear war that will eliminate humans and enhance the powers of mutants. But Shaw is pursued by an old enemy as well: Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) was one of his unwilling pupils during the war in Germany. Shaw killed Erik's mother, and Erik wants revenge. Erik reluctantly joins Xavier's group at the CIA, which is busy recruiting other mutants to the cause of Western democracy.<br /><br />As with the other X-Men movies, there are too many characters for us to know them well. \\"First Class\\" does, however, manage to say a lot about Xavier's idealism and his early relationship with Erik, who is the most completely written character in the film. Erik's experience in German concentration camps has made him pessimistic of mutants and humans living happily together and wary of any attempts to identify mutants. He hates Shaw but agrees with him. Ironically, Erik adopts the agenda of his torturer and mortal enemy and turns against Xavier, a man whom he respects and who saved his life. Other characters are not so skillfully drawn. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is featured prominently as she struggles with insecurities about her appearance, but she isn't a strong character.<br /><br />\\"First Class\\" let me down in the visual department. I found the action sequences boring. The half-hearted attempt to set the action in the 1960s consists mostly of putting the women in miniskirts and go-go boots. There is some very advanced technology for the 1960s in this movie, which would have reminded me of an early James Bond flick if it had paid more attention to period production design. All the CGI and high-tech gizmos look very modern, not retro. I'm sure a lot of viewers think this is fine: the style of comic books changes but is not particularly true to the period in which the action takes place. But the lame 1960s recreations constantly gave me that sense that the filmmakers weren't trying very hard. A genuine `60s look would have been a lot more fun.s about her appearance, but she isn't a strong character.  \\"First Class\\" let me down in the visual department.

B000HWXO4U|3.0|I have long given up that pop stars will include all their videos in one set. As the case here, See You and The Meaning Of Love never appeared in any Depeche Mode collection. So I'll have to thank YouTube for filling the void!  Depeche Mode is fond of using plants and flowers on their covers for Exciter and Violator. However, the content here is far from the pure white rose pictured. Many videos have disturbing and/or adult themes, so you might want to keep it from minors.  The general themes of construction, cars, isolation in big places, temptresses and whorehouses are pretty consistent throughout.   Personal Jesus shows the group visiting a whorehouse in the middle of a big lonely desert. In I Feel You, a temptress saunters in and poses seductively next to a statue of a religious figure to juxtapose sin and religion. Rather distubing like their song Blasphemous Rumours. Barrel Of  A Gun sees Dave Gahan doing a spot of automatic writing while possessed. Suffer Well has him walking pass a place with the signage HELL SUFFER WELL and then coming to a shop with Martin Gore dressed as a bride. It's all so subtle.  When you watch the videos in succession, it is easy to see the change in directors. Everything Counts, People Are People and Master And Servant by Clive Richardson are kind of similar, using machinery and construction to match the music. Then videos seven to 17 are helmed by Anton Corbijn, who's fond of using grainy shots of the vast desert. There are also two versions of Enjoy The Silence.  So yes, The Best Of Volume 1 is incomplete but on the whole it is still a decent set with enough rock and roll themes to freak out conservatives. Just don't air this during family gatherings.
0896600580|5.0|If you are a big fan of Rockwell, as I am, this is a must have for your library.  Most of his well known covers are here.  Some of the color reproduction is not great in this volume.  Still a great book at an excellent price.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|Movie tells us that neuroscientist discover that games in which you get money for reward activate same part of the brain like coccaine addiction. Bankers are rewarded by money, so its like coccaine. Coccaine is bad thing, therefore bankers are bad...<br /><br />But if you know something about anthropologist Helen Fisher, you will know that part of the brain, which is active in coccaine addiction is also active when you are in love with someone... Why movie doesnt say that this part of a brain is connected to love instead of coccaine?<br /><br />And this is just one example... Some bankers sleep with the prostitutes... Ok, how is it relevant to the financial crysis?<br /><br />Interviews are badly cut... There is one scene when some \\"bad guy\\" asks the interviewer about something and... jump to the next screen... Why I cant see what this clever interviewer responded? No, pictures of skyscrapers would be better! Why is there some advocat of financial industry when he is only allowed few words in the movie? How can I form opinion out of this? These \\"interviews\\" are cut in a Ben Stein's Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed way...
B004LWZW24|4.0|pretty good. I was prepared to be scared watching it alone, and I was a bit scared, but I think that really surprised me is that it has a good story line for a horror movie!!!  Not that this wasn't reminiscent of other horror movies (Poltergeist, The Messengers. .) but I was pleased with this movie.
B003L77G6K|5.0|The season was once again excellent, my whole family laughed out loud through most of the episodes and the characters and their relationships continue to develop in ways that are interesting. I get bored with sitcoms quickly, so it is remarkable that one holds my interest through four seasons.   The extras were very good, I especially enjoyed the behind the scenes at the live studio audience and the special on the Barenaked Ladies who wrote and perform the theme song.  The blu-ray itself arrived promptly (about 10 days with the free shipping option) and was in perfect condition. It ran and looked great.
B004L07KWQ|3.0|A fun little app for kids,  as long as you don't try to change the background color. To cycle through the different background colors available you have to press menu and &quot;set color&quot; over and over again until you've found one you like. Want to go back to a color you liked? You have to start over. And once you clear the screen your back to the black background, so again, you have to start over if you want a different color.  This part should be much better implemented.
B005GVA2L0|3.0|Alright..I've been a fan of Evanescence since they made it big. Fallen was my favorite album back when it was out. Open Door also really good, which was really dreamy and poetical, as someone described in a review. Couldn't agree with them more. Now their new self-named CD? Man..I hate to say it but it isn't that great. A lot of the songs do sound the same and it's just missing that Amy Lee charm altogether. When I listened to Swimming Home I thought I was listening to a pop song at first. I was like, \\"What is this?\\" While their single 'What You Want' is alright, it isn't great. In fact, I've heard it one too many times on the radio within the past week to be sick of it. My favorites on the new CD are 'The Other Side' 'Secret Door' and 'New Way to Bleed'. Others are just ok to me. I don't think it's possible for Amy Lee to make a bad song, seeing as her voice is pretty amazing but a bad CD? Possible. It wasn't \\"bad\\" it was just dull to ME. I'm not saying it sucks or that everyone rating it 5 stars doesn't know music. I'm just saying that, personally, I didn't think the CD was that good. It lacked a certain charm we got from the previous albums.<br /><br />An ok album. A bit disappointed. They just didn't seem to give it their all. Their music seems to have lost that gothic vibe. Which, maybe they're aiming for something else? If so, fine. Guess I aimed my expectations a bit too high. I was ecstatic to get the CD but I don't listen to it religiously like I did their first two albums because I don't find it that good..just saying. That's just me. I'm convinced though now, that there is never going to be another Fallen. And out of all their slow songs, there is never going to be another 'My Immortal'. Sometimes it should be that way.<br /><br />Either way, thanks Evanescence for coming back with another album. I'll be looking for your tour dates. I'm still a big fan.
B0052GACNM|5.0|MUST HAVE CD.  I AM REALLY ENJOYING LISTENING TO THIS CD.  EVERY SONG IS COOL AND SO ARE THE SINGERS......ONLY TONY BENNET COULD PULL THIS OFF.  HE'S THE BEST.

B00536OCZA|1.0|Just got my copy of this record. I was really hoping I wouldn't get damaged pressing as it has been with many unsatisfied customers whose complaints I have read here after I have ordered this item. But the miracle didn't happened. My copy of this record has many visible defects on its surface. You can almost constantly hear some disturbing noises during the process of playback on the both sides of the record. It is so frustrating. I am so disappointed with this purchase.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Excellent product. This works exceptionally well as a tiny, wallet-riding thumb drive once outfitted with a micro SD card 16GB or larger, yet with greater flexibility than a mere thumb drive owing to its capacity to swap out the memory. Couldn't recommend it more.
0486296342|1.0|Even though the book is free on kindle, and is an awesome book, I went ahead and bought the [[ASIN:0486296342 Little Women (Dover Children's Thrift Classics)]] paperback for my kids to read. I did not realize this is similar an abridged version (it does not mention that in description,) with all the words longer than 4 syllables eliminated/replaced!  Buy an unabridged version, if you really want to enjoy this book.

0312427565|4.0|Tom Wolfe tells an epic story of how seven test pilots pushed the outside of the envelope to become the first astronauts. Told with such energy, this story captivates the reader and tells a true tale of bravery, imagination, and ingenuity that paved the way for the Gemini & Apollo programs.<br /><br />The reason for the four stars and my only complaint about this book is Tom Wolfe's overwhelming dislike for Gus Grissom. Though it was originally believed that Gus was responsible for the loss of Liberty Bell, it was later proven that he was not at fault. Since the fault was found to be in the hatch with explosive bolts, this design was deleted from future spacecraft in lieu of an inward opening, bolted hatch. Ironically, this became part of a tragic chain of events that claimed the lives of Gus and his crew mates Roger Chaffee and Ed White aboard Apollo 1 during a plugs-out test. Unfortunately, this dislike carries over to the movie based on this book. Most people who have seen the movie or have read this book paint an unrealistic picture of Gus.<br /><br />Overall, this book is excellent. It captures the bravery and attitudes of the Mercury Seven and keeps the reader engaged and excited to turn the page.
B004L07KWQ|1.0|There is a brief banner, then a blank, black screen. Doesn't Work on Droid X. Will uninstall. Very disappointed. Can't back out, have to hit the home button, at least it didn't lock up my phone.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use this app daily! The only thing lacking is TV stations like XM has.   sound is great and pausing works well.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Okay people. Let's try to use some higher brain functions. This app is for the KIDS. My 2 year old is going to LOVE this app. The random colors are PERFECT for her. Some people have said that they get a banner &amp; then a black screen. Well I got the same thing. The black screen IS the drawing surface. Swipe your finger across it. This app works fine on my HTC Incredible running 2.2. To the guy, that complained about a child lock: try monitoring your kid with your phone. My daughter doesn't get more than 3-5 feet away from me when she has my phone just for the purpose of my being able to stop her from doing something that she's not supposed to. It's called parenting. To the guy that said that he doesn't have kids: who cares.  If the app doesn't apply to you, then don't even bother. In point of fact, yesterday's application was more female oriented. Being a man, I read the description, some reviews &amp; decided that it was not for me. I then backed out of the program &amp; went about my life. Does everybody have kids? No. Is everyone a female? Nope. Stop being selfish. Not every single application can apply to every single person. If you look back, most of the gaming apps that Amazon offers are focused toward men. Also, if the free app's description makes you wife cry that bad, maybe you should seek some counciling.
B0018BB20W|5.0|Greatest band that's been around for over forty years. I've seen them in copncert 13 times, twice this yearHoping they will be in the rock & roll hall of fame soon! they belong there a long long time  ago.

B000OONQ9O|5.0|There's really no need for a plot review.  If you're reading the reviews, chances are you've seen this excellent cult classic.  I purchased the Blu-Ray version of the film in early 2011, and getting to experience it in high-definition is a real treat.<br /><br />I was pretty late to the party with this film, having not seen it until the late 90's.  When I realized it was on Blu-Ray, I had hoped that the transfer would be good.  I wasn't let down.  The colors are excellent, and the amount of detail that you get down to the beads of sweat is just insane.<br /><br />I can't comment on the differences between the Director's cut and the original, as I didn't have the first version on VHS or DVD.  So that aside, this is still one of my favorite Blu-Rays to watch in HDTV.
B005FFW46S|1.0|If you are going to buy this book (And please do, Pratchett gets better with every one he writes) do NOT buy it on the Kindle. This is the absolute worse Kindle edition of a book I have ever seen. The table of contents is messed up, the story starts out with broken code at the top, and chapter headings are broken with a hard carriage between the first letter, and where the actual text starts.  The most unforgivable part is the loss of a TON of white space, which jams words together at the rate of three or four instances per page. It makes for a very distracting read, and it really kills the enjoyment of the book for me. I'll be getting this one in hard copy.  This book is a huge release, so I can't fathom how this happened, but I wish all the best for Sir Terry Pratchett. I'll be leaving a review of the actual book on the hardcopy version once I've purchased and read it.
B000JKA0B0|4.0|There isn't much to add that hasn't already been said.. Plenty of positive. The negative: I have to agree with other posters who have mentioned the live DVDs showing too much of the crowd, not enough of the band. I found it really frustrating how the camera would cut away from the band to the crowd, or vice versa, in the middle of a line or pyrotechnics sequence. The video editing here is pretty deplorable compared to other live DVDs I've seen. Biggest compliment I can give to the editing was following Ollie around in the boat during \\"Stripped.\\"<br /><br />Positive notes: For anyone who is in the process of learning to speak Deutsch, or anyone who would just like an easy way to learn lyrics, the closed captioning is nice. The audio CD's are really the high point of this release. After watching the concert footage, you'll remember the oddities in sound with the onstage antics and it'll make the CD experience that much better.<br /><br />The book is cool-looking, but again.. More band, less fans. There's plenty of pics of goth kids to be seen wherever you go, The candid shots and the scenery throughout the travel are the only worthy pieces for the price, and I would say unless you're feeling pretty hardcore, you don't need to buy the book version.
B0056HTEC2|5.0|This is a great CD for anyone who likes blues. Hugh Laurie is an incredibly talented man - actor, writer, musician. This is awesome!
B004L07KWQ|5.0|I've had the free version for a while now &amp; my kids love it! So glad to see it as the FAOD.
B005LF9IO8|5.0|From the start throughout most of the picture, the landscape and artistic filming of the movie keeps you visually attached, then, the plot and development take over and make it intriguing and riveting through the final minute of the film.   Wow, this starts with amazing footage, the beauty of nature and stalking then winds through the storyline to the finale which will blow you away.   Highly recommend this for a guys get-together...  it is something you definitely will not forget!
B005HSL626|4.0|Hey, you soccer moms. Your ramblings about the dangers of advertising do not qualify as a review. Don't expose your child to internet ads period if you're afraid of ads about zombies and pornography, (I've never experienced the latter, although I have seen a somewhat sexual dating site ad) and if you really want them to play this game sans adverts, you can pay for the paid one. It's about the price of a cheeseburger or a game of Time Crisis at the arcades. As for me, I'm old enough to handle zombies and scantily-clad women. As a matter of fact, I've grown an appreciation of those things. Also, one guy with a legitimate concern that this app is taking his contacts for nefarious, dastardly purposes, I've never seen any ill effects like you describe. You may have an issue with something else or maybe you're just unfortunate.  Any-friggin'-way, this game is gloriously well-made and deceivingly simple. On the outside, it looks way too simplistic, but the beast in question has layers, like parfait. And also, like a parfait, this game's got a lot of fruit. In fact, this game's all about fruit, bombs, and swords. I beleive several dozen people will agree that those are some of the finest things in life.   The object of the game is to cut as much fruit as you can. Whether it's a time limit or going until you miss too many fruits/hit a bomb, you cut up a juicy, fruity shake. It's kinda like working at Jamba Juice, exept it's far more pleasent. And the fruit-cutting, acheived by swiping your finger across your screen (if your using one of those Android laptops, I guess it'd be click-and-drag), works extremely well. On all three Android devices I've played this game on (a Pandigital Star, my Optimus V, and my mom's Samsung Droid Charge), the game works admirably well, which is awesome. Slight lag on the Pandigital Star. (it's only got 256 RAM, though)  It uses 3D graphics (they're not like Modern Combat, NOVA, Assassin's Creed or Splinter Cell or anything like that) which givethe game a good fluidity, and it also has a good cartoon-ish look about it, which it very charming and doesn't require a ridiculous amount of processing power due to lack of detailed textures. In short, it looks good. Damn good. And it's a pretty efficient worker. Like a chick who maintains minefields for a living.  And, well, that's about it. got OpenFeint for leaderboards and unlockable swords and gubbins like that, which is nice. The core gameplay is solid, works well, is extremely fun and doesn't take up nearly as much time as an Angry Birds addiction or something similar.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|I liked this movie.  What ticked me off was the crap Ultraviolet digital copy that doesn't work on iTunes or anything else but their crappy service.  This is very misleading.  I hope Warner Bros. wakes up and tosses this new service.  Absolute garbage.  Please stop it!!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Well. I got it for free with my Pandigital Star through Getjar, which was really nice. It's legal and it won't end up spamming you to death or virus-ing you. So, yes, gameplay is fast and fluid. It's got twin-stick controls like Robotron or Geometry Wars or Smash TV, and it plays well on a multi-touch device. you can adjust the size of the thumbsticks and choose to have them pop up wherever you touch, which is nice if you dig that kind of thing. It's really short, but the survival maps add ENDLESS replay value. Not bad for free, and at the current asking price is reasonable for such a good action game as well. There's hordes of zombies to kill with lots of awesome weapons in a variety of locations at various points in time, which is an awesome addition (READ: Zombie T-Rex. Yeah.) and will make a good addition to your collection. Get it, man, for serious.
B005LAZIRY|5.0|Excellent album. It's nice to see Opeth progress. I've gone from being a lukewarm fan to full on. I don't miss the death vocals at all.
0062112430|5.0|Lauren Oliver's Before I Fall was my favorite book of 2010 and I was eagerly anticipating her new dystopian follow up. Since I'm such a fan of both Lauren Oliver and dystopian books I had high expectations Delirium. I'm happy to say Delirium did not disappoint, and impressed me just as much as her first book. I read this book originally several months ago and was pondering it for a while deciding what to say in a review. I was emotionally wrecked after reading it the first time. I decided to re-read it after publication to pull my thoughts together. I ended up listening to the audiobook format this time.<br /><br />Delirium takes place in Portland Maine in a future world where love is considered a disease. The disease is identified as amor deliria nervosa and scientists perform brain surgery on all citizens when they turn eighteen to cure them of the disease. Just before the procedure the candidates must submit to an interview before they can be matched to their ideal husband/wife.  The main character Lena is just about to turn eighteen, and is looking forward to her procedure. Both of her parents have died, and the cure for deliria did not work on her mother after 3 attempts. Lena's best friend Hana is starting to rebel against the strict regulated books, music, and curfews they are expected to follow. Lena and Hana are at an after-curfew party when Lena meets up with Alex. They fall hard for each other but of course need to keep their relationship a secret. Unfortunately the clock is ticking on Lena's procedure date.<br /><br />The writing is incredible in this book. Ms. Oliver has a way with words and the emotions of the characters leap off the page. The writing is lovely and descriptive throughout the novel. Another nice touch is the passages at the beginning of each chapter. There are quotes from different government approved books, including the \\"Book of Shhh,\\" an abbreviation for \\"The Safety, Health, and Happiness Handbook.\\" These quotes provide more of a glimpse of the dystopian world.<br /><br />The set up of the book was done well and showed Lena's life prior to getting \\"infected\\" by Alex. In the beginning, Lena is on board with the government program to get matched and have the procedure. She did not want to end up un-cured like her mother, although she misses and remembers her fondly. The government restricts all kinds of activity that inspires love/deliria or laughter and bugs phone calls and conducts random raids to look for violations. It is interesting to see Lena's opinion change as she becomes more intrigued with the lives of \\"resisters.\\"<br /><br />This book explores relationships very well, and one of the strongest bonds in the book is between the friends Lena and Hana. They are best friends and have all kinds of plans of things they want to do before their procedure is scheduled. They enjoy going running together particularly. Lena worries that her friendship with Hana won't be the same after the procedure.<br /><br />The relationship between Alex and Lena is one of the most compelling aspects of the book. Their relationship is smoldering and passionate, and he opens her eyes to a different world. They have the odds stacked against them and it makes you want them to succeed as a couple that much more.<br /><br />The book really shines in the final third of the book, when the action leads to a gut-wrenching cliffhanger. I can't wait to find out what happens next. The next book in the series cannot arrive soon enough.<br /><br />Regarding the audiobook - I enjoyed listening to the book in this format. Actress Sarah Drew reads the book. Grey's Anatomy fans will know her as April. Since I listened to the book after I read it first, I had an opinion on what Lena's voice would sound like. At first, the reader did not match up to my expectation of Lena's voice. However, as I listened more to the story I felt the reader did a great job with conveying Lena's emotions and with the voices of the other characters. Theaudiobook is just over 11.5 hours long.<br /><br />Delirium is the first book in a trilogy. This book sets up the dystopian world well, but there is room to fill in more details about how the world ended up this way in future books. The premise seems believable and possible, and I enjoyed the dystopian elements. I would consider this book to be more about love and relationships first, but with a dystopian setting. I would recommend Delirium to fans of Before I Fall, as well as fans of YA and dystopians. The writing is simply beautiful, with a well-crafted story that will haunt you.n a trilogy.

Not only did it turn out to be worth the while but the Quatuor pour la Fin du Temps is also an excellent interpretation.  This DVD is a must for fans of Messiaen's enigmatic yet gorgeous music.
0142418471|4.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is about two high school boys with the same name who both live in Chicago. One is straight, and one is gay, and they both are struggling with their personal life. They happen to cross paths one night and their lives start to intersect. In the middle is straight-Will-Grayson's best friend Tiny, who is gay and not tiny at all. The two Will Grayson's and Tiny are all dealing with their own matters of the heart. Meanwhile, Tiny is putting on a high school musical production based on his life entitled \\"Tiny Dancer.\\"<br /><br />This book is co-written by John Green and David Levithan. John Green writes the odd numbered chapters in the POV of Will Grayson, and David Levithan writes the even numbered chapters in the POV of the other Will Grayson. This is the first book I have read by John Green, and the second book I have read by David Levithan (Dash & Lily.) I was completely wrong in my guess for which author wrote which character. John Green's Will reminded me a bit of Dash and that threw me off.<br /><br />This book is perfect for the audiobook format. The two voice actors do a great job voicing characters, including singing the musical numbers.<br /><br />The characters are honest and complex, and realistic portrayals of teenage boys. Early on I connected with John Green's Will Grayson. He is loyal and awkward, an indie music fan, and someone trying to figure out what he wants out of life. I did not connect with the other Will Grayson immediately. He is angry and full of angst and generally hard to like, and I was dreading his chapters. However, as the story continued my opinion of the other Will softened, and I ended up liking him just as much as John Green's Will Grayson. Tiny Cooper is over the top and fearless. Did I mention he writes, directs and stars in his own high school musical? I liked that the parents in the book were portrayed realistically and normal, not villainous. The friend characters Jane, Maura and Gideon all are positive additions to the story.<br /><br />This book is a smart, funny and honest, character driven book about identity issues and acceptance. This book would make a great movie. I recommend this book for fans of John Green and David Levithan and for anyone looking for a funny, touching, contemporary read. I especially recommend the audio format of this book.ook is a smart, funny and honest, character driven book about identity issues and acceptance. This book would make a great movie.

0143038419|5.0|Gilbert's The Last American Man is one of the most unusual and delightful books I've ever read, and I've read thousands of books. Now I want to read it again, because I like Gilbert's writing so much.<br /><br />Eat, Pray, Love got some lukewarm and even critical reviews when it came out. I'm reading it for the second time, laughing out loud, and enjoying it even more. Gilbert is an immensely talented writer. Eat, Pray, Love is a triumph.<br /><br />I mean I am laughing out loud and laughing hard! This book is delightful, fun, and intriguing. I keep wondering about the readers who claim the book is \\"dumb\\" and \\"boring.\\" I wonder just how much they know or care about eating, praying, and loving.<br /><br />I ordered Gilbert's Committed and I'm already reading it. Only an editor would say this, but I love her sentences.<br /><br />September 2012: I'm reading Eat, Pray, Love for the third time on my precious Kindle Fire, laughing out loud and crying. Gilbert is marvelous, her editors are excellent, and the Penguin copy editors are very good -- but just now I found two misspelled words in a row. I've been proofing and editing for many years; I very rarely find two misspelled words next to each other in a published book.<br /><br />\\"Pythagorian philospher\\"

B005E7AOHI|2.0|I only write reviews when I have something worth commenting on and boy does this qualify...  A lot of people don't like Primus because of Claypool's \\"cartoon vocals\\" this album does not  have them, instead he sings through the distorted low-end mic that he alternates between during  live shows.  The result is all bass (not the instrument the sound) there is very little treble  to compliment the guitar as a result.  Basically, this album just seems mixed wrong, it sounds   less like a Primus album and more like a Mid 90's rap album that you listen to in your car just   to make it vibrate.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|This is not your average, cookie-cutter movie where everything is laid out for you. It's a fantasy film, unless you purchased the movie in the dark, you could tell that by looking at the cover. Being said, it needs to be watched for what it is, not for what 1 & 2 star reviewers wanted it to be. If you haven't noticed, people thrive off of negativity...just watch the news.  This is the type of movie that you have to let yourself be taken by it. If you watch it while messing around on your phone, you will not understand it, and therefore not like it. Everything in the film is there for a reason and it's filled with metaphors. So if you like fantasy movies, watch it a couple times, think about it and make your own decision. I'm just glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews, cause I would have missed out.
0553801473|5.0|Martin continues his masterpiece with 'A Dance with Dragons'.  Many complaints are that not enough happens in this book and yet much does but more in setting up for the next addition to the series where we can expect armies to mobilize and begin to move as pieces on a Cyvasse board.  As is his style we lost another hero at the end of this book...or did we?  Several cliff hangers that will leave you wanting for the next edition today.

0385738773|4.0|This is the third and final book in The Maze Runner Series. I really enjoyed the first two books and gave both of them 5 stars. This one was also very good but I am giving it 4 stars. It is full of action from beginning to end. It seemed more violent to me than the previous 2 books but I think it is the kind of violence...the emotion that surrounds it in this book that made the difference for me. I have had my 4 children read the other two books and I must admit, because of some of the violence...I am hesitant to have my youngest 2 boys, (ages 8 and 10) read this book.  I feel like there were some great plot twists and some surprising and even shocking moments. However I also felt like a few scenes were extremely predictable to the point of being almost cliche. I also feel like the relationship with Thomas and Teresa never got the closure it needed and deserved.  While every good story is going to leave some questions unanswered there were a few questions and story lines in this series that I feel should have gotten answered and didn't. I kept waiting for  information and it never came. I realize that not having every question answered is part of story telling but in this case, I feel like I wanted that question answered and didn't walk away feeling a sense of mystery, I walked away feeling let down.  Overall this was a very good book and overall it was a good and fitting ending to this series of books that I have loved. I am giving it 4 stars for the reasons I stated above. I feel like there were some missed opportunities with the way some aspects of the story ended.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|This is an excellent GPS receiver, It locks on to 7 to 9 satellites while I am sitting on the couch in my house and 11 to 12 while out driving around. Installation was very simple and straight forward. The receiver is well constructed, made out of fairly heavy duty plastic with a good 5ft usb cable. The suction cup mount is functional but could be better. I use this GPS receiver with my Hp laptop running Windows 7 64 bit. It works great with Google Earth in either live mode or offline (cached) mode. If I want an arrow pointer and the ability to zoom in below 1000 feet while navigating in Google Earth, I use a free program called Goops along with Google Earth.  I purchased this item from Amazon and was very satisfied with the prompt shipping and the tracking status that was available to me.   If you want a good affordable usb gps receiver unit for your laptop, I recommend the GlobalSat BU-353, and also recomend purchasing it from Amazon.com.
B005D51JQQ|4.0|This is a great Sting collection. A few good songs were omitted such as Nothin' Bout Me and My Funny Friend And Me. But Still a solid effort. My biggest complaint is that it is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy over priced.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|Movie was definitely better then the second one but not too far from it. I wish it had more content but it didn't have no extras at all. It was nice of them to add the dvd/dc combo to the packaging to get an advantage on the pricing. I didn't get a chance to watch it in theaters, but am glad I own all the transformers on blu-ray...
B0052TDGQO|3.0|Scotty's voice and stage presence are so full of poise and rich with talent...but these songs are very weak.  Both musically and lyrically, especially lyrically, the songs are just plain boring and predictable.  I still believe he can be the next Garth Brooks, but he certainly needs some superior songwriters to get him the acknowledgement he deserves.  For now I'm sure the girls that find him \\"hot\\" or  \\"cute\\" will keep his boat floating but adults like me who appreciate excellent showmanship and a rich full voice like his will wait for a collection of much higher-quality songs from him.  It's coming, but us older people may have to wait until he passes the teen heartthrob stage.
0345529057|3.0|Maybe I OD'd on this series -- read the first four too closely together in time. But these long, seemingly endless series often come to a point where I don't care about the characters, can't follow the plot any more (assuming there is one) and just don't have the patience to endure yet another 1,000 + pages. That's where I am now.  That said, the writing is compelling in one of those endless \\"guy jumps out of a plane; fortunately he had a parachute; unfortunately the chute didn't open; fortunately there was a haystack....\\" kind of ways. So I gave it three stars and only dropped from four in frustration to this thing dribbling out over decades.   Anyway, there's a reason Tolkien, the master of the form, stayed with -- and wrapped up his story -- in three fairly succinct volumes. -- Hear that Stephen Donaldson and you other long-winded types?
B0028IDXDS|4.0|Our son is breast fed and pacifiers are not something he seemed to enjoy. We purchased this one as it was similar to the one from the hospital only it has the monkey attached. The weight of the monkey helps keep the pacifier in his mouth, he sucks on this pacifier more than any of the other ones of the same type we've tried. The animal attached to it is a good idea since it really does help keep the pacifier in his mouth.
B000002UML|5.0|I had only ever heard the except of the title track from this CD on best of compilations. After reading other reviews here I decided to purchase it. WOW does it rock! Very happy with this purchase. I like it much better than A Passion Play, Tull's other album length composition. I really like the extended rock jams passages. My first exposure to Tull was the \\"folk\\" albums SFTW and HH which will always be my favorite Tull recordings.....but TAAB is now right up there in my view....
B001LF3YQK|5.0|This is a great wipes case. I can just pull it out when I pull out the changing pad and leave it attached to my diaper bag so I don't forget it. It's also helpful to have it attached so I can keep one hand on the baby and pull wipes out one at a time. I like the sliding button to open the container, this makes it very easy to use with one hand as well.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Movie - 4.0<br /><br />When I initially saw this in theaters I had no exposure to the GL franchise whatsoever aside from a few Justice League episodes. I saw the movie, loved the potential, but couldn't really tell if prior knowledge was required to enjoy this even more. Afterward, I watched the two GL animated feature films First Flight and Emerald Knights. First Flight really caught my attention, so I set out to read up what I could on my new-found interest. And after seeing those animated movies, doing the research, watching the extras on this BD, and finally re-watching the film with everything I learned, I have to say I became quite interested in what the GL franchise holds. The story begins on a moon in a distant galaxy where a group of aliens have accidentally discovered and freed a being named Parallax. Parallax had been imprisoned there by a Green Lantern named Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) and was left in captivity so it could no longer wreak havoc throughout the universe with its terrible power. After escaping, Parallax finds Abin Sur in an attempt to exact its revenge. Mortally wounded, Abin Sur barely escapes his ship and sets course for the nearest inhabited planet: Earth. In a last, desperate attempt to transfer its powers to a worthy successor, his ring chooses rowdy test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). With the ring, Hal is entrusted with the power and duty of serving the Green Lantern Corp, an intergalactic military force responsible for upholding the peace across the farthest reaches of the universe. But upon initial skepticism by senior Green Lantern Sinestro (Mark Strong), Hal would have to earn the confidence of the Corps and its founders, the Guardians. Meanwhile, Hal must overcome his fear of obligation and face his inner demons as Parallax makes its way towards Earth.<br /><br />What draws me to this film is its basic concept of good vs. evil and the core values of what it means to be a hero. All the traits that usually accompany this kind of status (power, responsibility, hope, etc.) are there just like any other superhero flick. But I find it interesting how the franchise takes these ideals beyond the mere scope of Earth and expands them across the vastness of the universe. This is very lightly touched upon by the dynamic relationship and beliefs between Hal and Sinestro: one believing that willpower is what drives life, with the other believing that life is maintained through the oppression of fear. Sadly, though, the two problems I have with this film is that it spends too much time on earth and not enough across space, and the fact that the rest of the Corps like Tomar-Re, Kilowog, and Sinestro hardly get any screen time for development. I think all four of the main Lanterns were excellently cast, particularly Mark Strong. And I really hope that if a sequel comes out that they expand upon everyone's characters in greater detail, especially the clash of ideals between Hal and Sinestro. By the way, the Extended Cut of the film is greatly encouraged. It's only 9:43 longer, but it actually does a much better job putting Hal, Carol, and Hector's characters into context for later events.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />To start off, yes, aesthetically it's a fairly dark movie. Black levels are heavy and tend to crush some of the details and delineation making textures appear somewhat smudgy and a little hard to see at times, but that's exactly how it appeared in theaters and should be attributed to the cinematography. It's not any fault of the studio for making a bad transfer, so what you see is what you get. However, because of the heavy blacks I personally feel that colors receive a significantly bigger boost in boldness and vibrancy. The greens and yellows of the color palette are especially strong and were even addressed in the extras as an aspect they really wantedto nail in terms of presentation. Saturation is a little high as well and ends up making human flesh tones seem like everyone has a nice tan, but it also helps in accentuating the looks in all the alien lifeforms. Tomar-Re, Kilowog, and Sinestro, in particular, look great and very detailed in comparison to other versions of them I've seen in both the GL animated films and various drawings from the comic book art. And Blake Lively, mm.. Despite her casting being a little too young for the actual role of Carol she is, indeed, a beauty and I had trouble keeping my eyes off her in just about every scene she was in.<br /><br />Contrast feels very well-balanced, especially when she's on-screen (and I guess for Reynolds if you're a gal that likes looking at him, too). But yeah, I didn't think overall detail was as bad as so many other people make it out to be. In fact, compared to Sherlock Holmes and Kick-Ass (two other films that I feel had more problematic color schemes) this looks way better. Sherlock was not only crushed, but the art direction and costuming was considerably grey and foggy, whereas Kick-Ass had that weird \\"no blacks\\" palette to mimic the comic (ironically, both films also star Mark Strong). My favorite scenes are when Hal visits his nephew (it's probably the most \\"normal\\" down-to-earth-looking scene you'll find) for it's balanced and filmic texture, and then probably when Hal goes to Oa for his introduction into the Corps and initial training for its colorfulness and CG integration.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Thai: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Extended Cut: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 only<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Korean, Mandarin (Simplified), Thai<br /><br />While the video presentation might be questionable for some, the audio should be a no-brainer. Mixed by Michael Keller, Rick Kline, and Mike Prestwood Smith, 2 of who worked on such films as Hellboy II, Casino Royale (two of my loudest BDs) and the other nominated for 11 Oscars in Sound, Green Lantern comes with a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track that is sure to give your home theater system a rightful workout. The F-35s in the dogfight sequence are a pretty good indicator of what to expect with a very nice rumble and awesome directionality as the jets fly across the screen (ironically enough, one of these sound mixers also worked on Top Gun, go figure). LFEs are further tested by the occasional pulsing of Hal's power ring or any other green energy effects that either engulf or emanate from him during battle. Another great display is in the presence of Kilowog. When we first meet him on Oa and he tussles with Hal, even his footsteps feel thunderous.<br /><br />Separation is keen, specifically in the GL training sequence and when Hal is fighting Parallax. Whether he's using his constructs, getting pushed around, or having stuff blow up around him, when things start to pick up, action-wise, there's really nothing to complain about. Some reviews argue that just a tiny bit of the dialogue can become indiscernible when the sound gets too loud, but I never lost any of what they were saying (which might've been a word or two like \\"run!\\" or \\"look out!\\"). Getting back to the directionality, though, I really like the overall sound design and the comic book-esque effects they created. Specifically, I love the sounds the constructs make when they're being created by the Lanterns. The idea of energetic constructs itself feels very imaginative and the kind of clanking and dispersion noises they make when being built and discharged makes for a cool sound that kind of gets my own imagination going. My favorite scenes for reference are the aforementioned dogfight (for its roaring bass and panning effects) and then the scene where Hal is training on Oa (for its greatdirectionality and separation amongst all the fighting and constructs being thrown around).<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Maximum Movie Mode (162:55)<br />A Picture in Picture application that plays along with the Theatrical Cut of the film. It's not the \\"all-out\\" version where the director stands in front of split-screens and pauses the thing every now and then to explore an aspect of something, but instead we get DC Entertainment Chief and Green Lantern writer Geoff Johns taking us through a lot of material concerning the making of the film itself. I should also point out that there's a difference between watching MMM and the truncated Focus Points that are available separately from the movie. If you watch MMM in its entirety, it not only gives you the Focus Points, but also stills galleries and additional interview footage with Johns, Ryan Reynolds, director Martin Campbell, and other members of the cast and crew. This was a very big reason for me liking the film as much as I do, as it really shows you the amount of hard work and production that went into making it. I highly recommend everyone give this a viewing, whether you're a fan of the actual comic book series or just a casual movie-goer. It's quite informative.<br /><br />- Focus Points (HD; 46:55 altogether)<br />If you're interested in the film-making process of the movie itself, these offer a lot of background and production notes that fans should really get a kick out of. The following features cover: pre-production and concept art while the movie was in its planning stages and how they eventually portrayed it, the filming of the dogfight and the level of realism Campbell wanted to put into it, the planning process and execution of what and why they chose to do GL's costume completely in CG, the motion-capturing, visual effects, and voice acting of the GL Corps, the prosthetic work that went into Abin Sur, Sinestro, and Hector Hammond, the concept and construction of the Guardians, and then thesame for Parallax. Below are the segmented titles and their running times:<br /><br />- The Art of Green Lantern (6:03)<br />- Weapons Hot: The U.C.A.V. Dog Fight (4:04)<br />- Reinventing the Superhero Costume (7:46)<br />- Ring Slinging 101 (5:20)<br />- We are the Corps (5:38)<br />- Acting Under 10 Pounds of Silicone (7:10)<br />- Guardians Revealed (6:10)<br />- When Parallax Attacks (4:42)<br /><br />Other features include:<br /><br />- The Universe According to Green Lantern (HD; 20:12)<br />An exploration of the comic book franchise from the various writers and artists that have worked on Green Lantern over the years. It's a fascinating progression from when the first issue started to about the point of Green Lantern: Rebirth. After watching MMM and all the Focus Points, this was icing on the cake in really getting me hooked on what the comics have to offer. I highly recommend this as a compliment to MMM, and to rookie fans like myself who'd like to know more about the franchise.<br /><br />- Ryan Reynolds Becomes the Green Lantern (HD; 8:48)<br />Thoughts and analysis of the character Hal Jordan from cast and crew. It basically shows Reynolds and a lot of the prep he had to go through: 9 months of working out, doing some of his own stunts, and what he personally found interesting about Hal Jordan that made him want to do the role in the first place.<br /><br />- Deleted Scenes (HD; 7:16)<br />Incomplete ones at that.<br /><br />- Justice League #1 Digital Comic (HD; 9:13)<br />Part of the New 52 lineup. It's the entire issue with automatic moving panels and has some pretty sleek artwork.<br /><br />- Preview of Green Lantern: The Animated Series (SD; 6:32)<br />The art is a little weird, but the storytelling and voice acting have potential.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />By this point, I'm confident in saying that I've become totally enamored with world of Green Lantern. The idea and concept of an intergalactic marine corps looks and sounds like a verycool idea. After seeing the two currently available GL animated features from DC, doing some research around the 'Net, and watching the incredibly informative extras on this BD, I am really excited with the prospect of discovering this franchise and learning a lot more about it. If anyone out there is reading this and can recommend me any graphic novels and such, I'd be more than willing to listen. And hopefully, if Warner can get enough funding together they'll make a much-needed sequel to further expand, what I think is, a really cool concept in the Green Lantern. The video quality looks great to me, but may be a little too dark for others, while the sound should be more than sufficient. And if you're a fan of the film or the franchise itself, definitely give the extras a look and maybe even check out those animated films if you haven't already. Highly recommended.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is my favorite Jane Austen story.  Her characters, Lizzy and Darcy, are so romantically written.  A perfect anytime read.
1933633867|5.0|The author refers to ancient Jewish law that provides for debt release during Sabbaths of years.  Every seven years, debts are released and slaves are freed.  However, the poor often have to sell their property to pay debts, etc.  The fix for this was the Jubilee, or a Sabbath of Sabbaths or 49 years.  At that time, property sold previously then reverted back to the original owners and their heirs.  A Jubilee was at a set time so naturally the property value was seen as a lease value depending on the time left on the lease.    Ownership was not in any way fee simple.  It was based on the concept that Yahweh owned the land.  The American Indians who sold Manhattan had a similar view of the \\"Great Spirit\\" owning the land and although the Dutch thought they bought the land fee simple, the Indians had no concept of that.  They were issuing a use permit.  In modern economies, I think there are natural Jubilees. I bought my house in Mission Viejo new in 1966 for $19,500.  My salary was $8000 a year.  Do you see what I am driving at?  Inflation is a kind of Jubilee.  We are stuck in almost deflationary times with interest rates artificially held at near zero.  There is no way the dollar is worth anywhere near it's current value when one considers how much has been printed out of thin air during the past 5 years or so.    I think raising interest and tightening money would motivate the banks to lend money again and lower the value of the dollar to a point where over about 10 years the dollar purchasing power would drop like it did in the 80's.  That would wipe out debt and drop the deficit and national debt to manageable size.  Salaries would increase and government would collect more revenue.  Increasing interest rates gradually over the next few years would stimulate the housing market.  People would rush out and buy homes and refinance because they would know that the rates are going up.  Buying doesn't start until rates start to go up.  Business investment would also goup because there is no cheaper time to finance than now and as rates go up, demand for credit goes up.  Right now, we are artificially propping up the value of the money that the 1% own to the detriment of the 99%.  I suggest inflation is better than revolution.

B004L07KWQ|5.0|I don't have any ads on my version for some reason, so I don't see any half naked ladies in the app...<br /><br />The app is simple and works perfectly for me  HTC Incredible 2). I'm not a kid, but I guess I have the heart of a kid because this is pretty awesome to me at least. Doesn't need complicated features like others are suggesting, keep it nice and simple.
B0052WSX32|5.0|This is a very memorable album.  Play it today and it will stay in your memory for the next 3 decades.  Doris Day has that voice of crystal clarity with the sun shining on every note.  I especially liked My Buddy sung by her son. It is so sentimental and full of feeling.  To hear Doris speak too was wonderful.  It compelled me to go back to Amazon to buy her Greatest Hits...and perhaps others too as she is a refreshing break from all the singers today that I cannot either understand what they are singing or make out the words.  Singers these days seem to need visuals and effects to sell them as well as having the looks.  Doris Day only needs her voice and personality and she will carry through her songs as a part of musical history for years to come.  Faithfully,  Stan Chun  Wellington  New Zealand
B0038M2AZA|4.0|Very good movie with a special message that meant a lot to my daughter, wife, and I.  Thought the movie was well made and the acting great.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Being a long time fan, I've been waiting for this album to come out for a long time.  However, I kept in mind that 5 years between albums is long and can change the style of the band.  I can notice a slight change in style, but the Evanescence's identity is still strong!  I can't stop listening to this album!
B004L07KWQ|5.0|What I like the most about this app is that it is very simple (you get a blackboard soon as you start the app then you can start drawing whatever you want) and its so very fun and colorful. Great to entertain your kids or to write a colorful message and show to someone special :) I think it will work even better if you use a stylus so you can trace lines better. Definitely worth downloading it. On Oct 14, 2011 it was a free app of the day so even better :)
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|The 2 CD Greatest Hits is well worth the money. I've greatly enjoyed it, even though it's very, very different from what I'd thought Peter Gabriel's music would be like. Yes, there are the radio hits of \\"Sledgehammer\\", \\"Shock the Monkey\\", and \\"In Your Eyes\\" that I bought the collection for originally. But the rest of the more than 2 hours of music is much slower, ambient, and eclectic music. It has proven to be a very good introduction to the vast range of Gabriel's non-radio work. However, as I've gotten into more of his non-radio work, I've come to realize this HIT collection doesn't do it justice. This collection does have a handful of new, rare, or remixed tracks that still make it valuable to avid fans that have his past work.
B004H83IG4|5.0|Kathy McCarthy (Kirsten Dunst) was a free-spirited girl from Long Island nursing the pain of her father's recent death.  David Marks(Ryan Gosling) was an emotionally scarred son of a Manhattan real estate tycoon (Frank Langella).  The realtionship between the two from Jump Street portends doom.  Kathy didn't stand a chance in this family and her disappearance in 1982 should come as no surprise.  Based on a real life mystery director Andrew Jarecki maintains an element of creepiness and suspense that will keep you riveted.  The obvious finger could be pointed at David but Jarecki throws a few red herrings and other ulterior motives that those assumptions are stood on their head.  Credit also a bravura turn by Gosling as the violent and unstable David.  In lesser hands this could be a heavy-handed performance but Gosling engenders sympathy for the unsavory David.  Dunst, who was in the public eye as a child actress, gives a career defining turn as the doomed Kathy. She may have unjustifiably attracted the ire of David and his kin but she's no victim.  She's a strong woman who's made a terrible choice.  2010 was a terrific year for film and \\"All Good Things\\" stands high among that year's crowning achievements.
B001W6S0C6|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie because there are millions of them out there, so I'm going to review the special features, which are the real stars of this blu ray.<br /><br />Several hours of documentary segments that are very informative, from information about the Batman mythos to the production of the movie.  There are 3 Prince music videos, a great commentary with Tim Burton.  And to top it off, a book is inlaid in the blu ray case with several pictures and lots of information on the making of the movie.<br /><br />If you're a junkie for special features like I am, this is a great purchase.
1439192812|5.0|I have been reading popular science books for a while. But this one is different from all of them. One of the best I read so far.
1593272839|5.0|Best book ever.  But now I must write seventeen more words for this review to post so here they are!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This saga, complete with bonus feature discs, is fantastic! A must for any sci-fi fan. You're movie library just isn't complete without this set. These versions are the full-length movies which George Lucas intended when he set out making STAR WARS. The movies contained within this set are not the original releases to the theater. These are the extended versions which have more of George Lucas' intended vision, but simply didn't have the technology to create, at the time of their releases.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Thor is a highly entertaining film. It manages to blend superhero action with an interesting story line. The performances from Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins are top notch.  The 3D is well done, though at times it seems that a forced perspective was used - the scenery appears as cardboard cutouts. Those scenes are few. Overall a very enjoyable movie experience.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE ANYONE WILL EVER SEE IN THEIR ENTIRE FREAKING LIFE! BEST MOVIE EVER! IT ROCKS!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|A well directed, well acted, and nicely filmed suspense flick.  I watched this on a lark using my Amazon Prime free view, and ended up engrossed in the film. It does have aspects that leave the interpretation to the viewer, not something I normally prefer, but well done here. All of the cast does a sterling job. Recommended for fans of crime/mystery/bordering on thriller movies.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was looking for a good pocket sharpener and this item fit the bill and for much less then I have seen them for.
061891868X|4.0|An interesting book, and although the topic itself is too esoteric for many readers, Smolin successfully makes his point that physics has been at a standstill for a few decades now without any major breakthroughs in our understanding of our universe.  Science suffers from its enormous success.  Boundries of physical science has been pushed beyond the point where experimental verification is no longer feasible or very difficult.  Where experiment lacks, there is theory to fill in the void, and when theory can not be backed up by solid experiment, measurement and data, fads and politics take over.  Does it have to be this way?  Smolin argues that it does not have to be and if the String Theory had not sucked all the oxygen out of the system, we may have had a chance to investigate other maybe more productive avenues. He even presents some very interesting examples and possibilities.     One problem with the book is it is actually two books in one.  While the first half is dedicated to the history of development of String Theory and its significance, accomplishments and failures, the second half is an idictment of academic politics in general.   He is obviously qualified to expand on both topics, but makes the book a little disjointed.  In any case, writing is easy on the reader, there is considerable name dropping and some airing of laundry.  Recommended if the topic is of general interest.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|If you are a AC/DC fan and just want some of the hits...well this would be a good choice.  They have some of the classics as well as some of the newer stuff.  Enjoy the CD and hope others share this as well.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Embarassing to admit, I'm one of maybe 17 people on the entire planet who had never heard of Adele until this album came out.  It took exactly one listen of 'Rolling' to turn my head and say, 'Whoa, who on earth is THAT?'.  I immediately looked her up on Amazon to order her CD, only to find she had a previous release.  So, I bought both.  While '19' is indeed a stellar collection - and I can see exactly why this girl got so much attention with her debut - the performances on '21' are at times absolutely jaw-dropping.  The growth of this artist in just two short years is astonishing ... the warmth and depth of a talented young woman coming into her own.  I've now read some of her earlier reviews from that first release, comparing her to Amy Winehouse - whose alma mater she apparently shares - and in listening to '19', I get it.  But when I close my eyes and listen to '21', I hear a mature soulfulness akin to Susan Tedeschi, and Macy Gray.  She has heart well beyond her years.  Remember when you were a teenager, listening to your favourite singer-songwriters: James Taylor, The Carpenters, Carole King, Jackson Browne, Jim Croce - remember how their songs seemed to speak to your own emotions?  You'll get that same hit here.  The intimacy of the lyrics coupled with her achingly beautiful delivery can be almost heart-stopping.  I defy you to listen to 'Don't You Remember' or 'Someone Like You' without feeling a little tug on your tearducts.  ;-)
B001DZDTUO|5.0|OMG!  I have not heard this CD since it was out on vinyl back in the 70's.  Wow! bought back memories of my partying days.  Great CD and enjoy listening to it and would highly recommend this to all those Nazareth fans!
B005EXA8LY|5.0|Truly a gem.  I can't really add much more from a musical perspective from the other reviews, other than to agree that this is a work of art!  Steven is an incredibly committed artist in the true sense of the word, who keeps on producing and delivering the highest quality art in the highest quality sound formats.  The Blue Ray mixes, both in 5.1 lossless and LPCM 2.0 lossless are amazing!  Steven is the surround king, but with this release in Blu Ray I predict that he will become the leader in high quality audiophile production in this format for years to come.  A couple of requests:  - To release also a DVD-Audio lossless version, so that I can pop it in my DVD-A player in the car.  Blue Ray is not yet mainstream in cars, unfortunately.  - Bring Gavin Harrison back for the next solo effort.  Even though the drumming in this album is very good, Gavin is still the best drummer in the world and he does up a certain quality and creativity that is unmatched.
B00466HN8G|5.0|What a great movie with an outstanding message!  A MUST SEE for everyone!  Can't wait till this movie is available to purchase!
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I was so looking forward to seeing Star Wars released to Blu Ray, but having seen The Empire Strikes Back on a 50\\" LED SONY BRAVIA 1080p TV, I am so not liking Star Wars. The clarity of the HD is so wonderful, you can see every production flaw, every fake prop, every not-so-perfect scenery set element, and Chewbacca's hair looks like a cheap fake fur ape suit. None of this can be seen in the theatrical film, or on VHS or DVD. On those media, these errors are hidden by the subtle smoothness of film. But, in the BluRay HD versions, I swear, it's like watching the movie as if it was recorded on video tape. Even the actors movements seem artificial, flat, and not very convincing. Truly, its like watching what someone would have created using a video camera. The lighting even seem too artificial.  The problem, as I see it, is HD has taken away the softness of the film rendering and replaced it with the harshness of reality. There is no denying the picture is incredibly sharp and crystal clear, and here lay the problem. This is suppose to be a Science Fantasy movie, but it feels more like watching a reality show on the Making of Star Wars. The HD has completely removed the ability for me to suspend reality and take in the story. The HD makes every visual element appear too REAL - too \\"this is a movie prop\\".  My advice - stay with the DVD version. There you get a much better picture than on VHS tape, but it preserves the FILM softness. This is NOT a movie you will want to watch HD unless you really want to watch Star Wars that resembles Dr. Who video taped episodes from the 80s.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|To keep it quick, what a movie!! It has everything you want in a western, a great storyline, great acting, great cinematography, and great gun battles. What a spectacular cast, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, and the beautiful Claudia Cardinale. You have Henry Fonda, the dangerous, and unrelenting killer Frank, Charles Bronson, the quick drawing quiet, dangerous, yet sympathetic Harmonica, and personally my favorite character in the film, Jason Robards, the funny, smart, and tough Cheyenne. And to top it off, Ennio Morricone does the musical score, and it is directed by the great Sergio Leone. Sergio Leone is such a complex director, if you get a chance listen to the commentary, it will really teach you a lot of what he was going for and to say enough it is just brilliant. The first ten minutes of the film is an expression of natural sound and facial expressions and you don't really understand it until you listen to the commentary. It really does give you an inside track to what Sergio Leone was thinking. So watch the movie, it was excellent.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and have been waiting for the DVD release! This is pee-your-pants funny with an outstanding over-the-top cast. Is it a bit far-fetched? As Sarah Palin would say, you betcha...but most comedies are, and the cast pulls this story off with tongue firmly in cheek. Some of the A list talent in this movie (that are all playing second fiddle roles) are so far removed from what you'd expect is what really sets this apart from The Hangover. This is must see!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I am in the US, but still get the amazon.co.uk vwrsion. lame... Also, need better playlist support. now i have to write more words to submit
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|First, this is not a stand-alone feature so it's a prerequisite that you view the OVA as little time is spent here on character development and backstory.<br /><br />For those who have seen the OVA, this is basically a turbo-charged retelling of it meaning that nearly everything's redone with today's computer technologies giving it a mega budget feel.<br /><br />You Are Not Alone encompasses about a third of the original OVA with new material that sheds more light on the relationship between Shinji and his father including a funeral scene. Unlike the OVA, this feature is easier to get into, which, depending on what you thought of the denseness of the OVAs can be good or bad. Not to say that this feature isn't \\"deep\\" its that this feature backs off of some of that so  that you can appreciate the main justification for its existence, its visuals, and here they are nothing short of extraordinary augmented with the cgi elements they've added. And the EVAs in this one are even brighter and more deeply colored and truly neon.<br /><br />Like I said, no need to get into the plot since those who've seen the OVAs know what it's all about. But take it from me, everything you liked about EVA is squared in this feature.
0385344325|5.0|Since being hooked with The Killing Floor, I've waited with baited breath for every new Reacher book. I have no clue how Mr. Child does it, but he's done it again - thrilling suspense, spare, non-flourished prose, fabulous character development, and a riveting story.   I actually felt this was one of the very best Reacher books yet, perhaps because I'd always wondered about his backstory...and the lead-ins to the very first book (Killing Floor) - bringing things full-circle - are ingenious.  My only let down is the start of another wait for the next installment!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Just finished watching First Class and my impressions are positive overall, though at the same time a little mixed seeing that the filmmakers took quite a few liberties with the source material.<br /><br />I was born in '67 and grew up in the 70's and late 80's in what was, arguably, the heyday of the X-men, just before the title took off under Chris Claremont and the great John Byrne culminating in the Dark Phoenix saga and the subsequent spin-offs. First,Banshee and Mystique came along decades later in the X-men. The Beast didn't get hairy until around issue 106 or so around the time that the X-men became the new X-men with the additions of Nightcrawler, Banshee, Storm, Colossus, and Wolverine, who, I'm glad, they remembered to leave out of this movie seeing that he wasn't an original member. Also, I would like to have seen the Juggernaut, Xavier's brother, and the Blob, both of whom were charter members of Magneto's evil mutants. Also, where were Jean Grey and Scott Summers, Marvel Girl and Cyclops who were also founding members of the X-men?<br /><br />Anyway, inconsistencies aside, I really enjoyed this latest X-men movie. For the first time since they started making these movies, I felt like this was the most accurate and respectful attempt to capture the flavor of the comic. Even the old yellow and black costumes looked like the comic sans the big X on the front torso. The story was logical and provided a solid emotional justification for Magneto's fear and loathing for normal humans and showed how misfits could follow someone like him. The acting was first rate. I also like the fact that they stayed away from \\"big\\" actors who could distract from the story. As far as superhero films go, this is the best one since the Dark Knight. A real sleeper and very low key. Lastly, I think what separated this film from the others and made it better was that it had a different director, a better director, and it shows. Hope he does the follow-up.
B003L20IJM|5.0|The DVD was fine and it came in the window of time.  However, the Amazon review process is now very time consuming and I do not get paid to do this.  I can't seem to get this done without putting in at lease a 20-word comment.  Stream line the review process or I will quit doing it!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Challenging, but not overly difficult and limited hints are available if you get stumped. It makes you think 3 steps ahead.
B00009L1UP|5.0|I was happy to trade in my tape for the same CD. Beautifully mastered, you are not hardly going to get the lead singer ever at his prime again.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|After years of middling animated films after the Renaissance (not including 'Lilo and Stitch' which was fantastic), Disney has finally returned with 'The Princess and the Frog'! As with most Disney films, the plot has many twists and changes the fairy tale into a great adventure for the whole family. There are memorable songs to accompany the beautiful animation and story, which never become tiring.   I won't write much, for there isn't much to tell. This movie is great!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Very enjoyable fun read.  The characters are well written.  The relationship between druid and dog are LOL hilarious at times.  Werewolves and Vampires and Gods, oh my!

B00014TJ6Q|5.0|George Harrison's self-titled 1978 release is my favorite of the few that I own.  Admittedly a huger fan of Paul's solo work, I never shut the door on the other three ex-fabs because it took all four of them to make some of the most special music of all time.  True, I was 15 years old when I first bought this album, and my tastes hadn't matured yet, but I bought this on cd about 5 or 6 years ago, and realized what a wonderful pop album this truly is.<br /><br />Hits such as \\"Love Comes to Everyone,\\" and \\"Blow Away\\" stayed in my mind for their catchy hooks, their mellow sweetness, and George's genius for putting guitar riffs and fills in the right places at the right times notwithstanding, but the beauty of this work is fully realized to me all these years later, because there is simply nothing wrong with a mellow pop album full of optimism, gentle handling, and subtley crafted skill on a level that only George can deliver.<br /><br />I love everything on this album without exclusion, and his low-key optimistic tunes are not only infectious, they are comforting and pleasant to hear, be it a drive in the car, or sitting at home chilling out.<br /><br />Rather than get too long-winded, I would like to share my favorite tracks, which is difficult to start with!<br /><br />\\"Love Comes to Everyone:\\"  Absolutely beautiful, hooky, and a natural to have received more airplay than it did.<br /><br />\\"Not Guilty:\\"  George is good at light jazz arrangements, and I would have liked to see him do more of this in his career, but this is certainly a good pre-Beatle breakup song, and the arrangement is superbly done.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes the Moon (Both versions):  By far and away my favorite here.  Beautiful slowly descending guitar riff and dreamy keyboards that make you feel as if you're in Hawaii with him when he was inspired to write this sequel to the lovely \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\"<br /><br />\\"Blow Away:\\"  What a great choice for a hit single, trademark slide guitar, message of happiness, and all.  This is easily George at his most uncompromisingly commercial best.<br /><br />\\"Dark Sweet Lady:\\"  Obviously a song for his lovely Olivia, again a bit jazzy.  The sweetness of his ode to her is delightfully touching and it is a standing testimony of his devotion--if not always his faithfulness--to her.<br /><br />\\"Soft Touch:\\"  Man, the guitar riffs get me here.  Very nice and pure sounding.<br /><br />\\"If You Believe:\\"  Some more of George's good karma lyrics and his irresistible slide guitar.<br /><br />Whoever thinks this album is weak or that George's voice is weak, and that his guitar work isn't heavily featured needs their ears checked.  This is a fine mellow outing by our gentle, quiet George.  That's where the deception lies.  George delivers a gentle roar with plenty to say about love and beauty.  What he doesn't put into words, his guitar says the rest for him.  Lovely arrangements, upbeat lyrics, and a positive attitude.

1612130283|5.0|I loved this!  This book is a must for anyone who enjoys BDSM romance.  Christian Grey is a dark, broken soul, tormented by demons, and needs to exert his control,  and Anna Steel is just the girl to help him.  Their romance is very well depicted, and follows a realistic path, hitting plenty of bumps along the way.  She is unfamiliar with the world of BDSM and he teaches and arouses her, showing her some things she loves, and others she hates.  He is controlling and dominant, but she is feisty and has plenty of backbone.  It is a moving story that is entertaining, and will stay with you long after you have read it.  Highly recommended.  I read Fifty Shades Darker, too and am eagerly awaiting the final installment.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|I loved this movie since I saw it several years ago. Watching it in Bluray made the experience only better. Recommended.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|Loved this sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey.  So often a sequel is lack-luster, but not in this case.  Fifty Shades Darker continues the story and see Anna fleeing from Christian on foot of discovering the full extent of his desires.  She fears she isn't the woman for him, and he is determined to win her back.  The story further develops the relationship between Anna and Christian,and tackles some of his demons.  It is a credible story, compulsive reading and like its predecessor will remain with the reader long after the book is finished.    If you haven't read Fifty Shades of Grey, and this, Fifty Shades Darker, do so now.  You wont be disappointed.
1439170916|5.0|Inspiring for anyone interested by how science evolves and it's impact on our day to day life. Recommended for general public as well as for hard core scientists.
B005F82X48|5.0|I first heard their song \\"Make a Move\\" (which is the best song on the CD in my opinion) and it made me want to hear more.  I purchased the album, and feel good about my acquisition.  Sometimes you take a risk buying the first album of a brand new group. There is no risk here, it was a great buy. Icon for Hire is comparable to Flyleaf or maybe even Fireflight. Enjoy!
B000022TSH|5.0|I saw CHINATOWN when it was first released, and to this day it is a film that comes to mind whenever I talk to other film buffs. The storyline, the musical score, and especially the actors chosen for the film. Finally, when I wanted to buy the DVD, it was impossible to get, that is until AMAZON came through,  thanks.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I liked the CD.  I also ordered the Fame Monster that had 2 CDs in it unbeknownst to me and I got duplicate music, but it's ok -- niece loves Lady G and she can have my duplicate one.
B005EHNEDO|5.0|I've always liked Wilco...but not loved.  At least until now.  I think this is Grammy Good and clearly their best music ever.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I really like Lady Gaga and this is a very good CD.  Since I have to use at least 20 words, I will say it skipped when I played it on my Bose system --- turned out it was the system and not the CD.
B002ZG97M4|5.0|After a very long wait, I finally just saw the new Footloose film in the theater...   I could barely hold the excitment in any longer!!!   I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!  As a child of the 80's & probably the biggest Footloose fan of all time, I will say that if you go into this movie thinking that it will be the same Footloose you saw back in the 80's, you will probably be a bit surprised & maybe even disappointed.  After reading some previous articles/reviews from other sites, talking with people at work & friends etc... I found a lot of people who Hate the idea of this movie being re-made.  I also believe that most, if not all of these people wouldn't like the idea of any older film being re-made & think they believe films being re-made are bad before they even see them.  I can understand where these people are coming from, but to all of those people please give this movie a chance! Also, remember like me, the original Footloose will always hold a special place in your Heart, so even if you dont like this newer version, you won't lose the older version!!!  Futhermore, although this newer version of the Iconic Film has a lot of similarties to the old version, it isn't the Old version!!!   However, this Version of the film offers it's own STYLE & FLARE!!!  A lot of the scenes in the movie were near matches to scenes in the Original Footloose, and I really appreciated that, as it shows much Respect to the Original.  Also the same VW bug appeared, same tux jacket & similar outfits, hairstyles, quotes etc...  All the main actors did a Fantastic Job in their respective roles!!!  Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough had incredible on screen Chemistry & made a very good Ren & Ariel.  Julianne looked AMAZING & showed she can act & act well!!!  Kenny showed he can act as well & though he was no Kevin Bacon, he did one heck of a good job playing Ren.     Dennis Quaid played the strong willed Pastor, and he was very believable & real!  The new Williard did a good job... he was funny,showed his slow side(lol), had some great dance moves, and really fit the role well as his chemisty with Kenny Wormald was excellent!  The bad guy who played Chuck Cranston in the movie didn't seem to fit too well! I didn't like him near as much as Jim Youngs who played the bad guy in the Original Footloose.  The Dancing sequences were Amazing, and appropriate for todays style of dancing.  The songs/music were pretty good, but no match compared to the older Famous film Soundtrack that accompanied the original film.  They did manage to play the Kenny Loggins version of Footloose in the film, and I think they played the Deniece Williams version of Lets hear it for the boy, in which it was really nice to hear both of the original versions in this film.  Even though I like the Origianl Better, all in all I liked this Version of Footloose too. It was Exciting, Fun, Intense, High Spirited, Invigorating & was an AWESOME FLASHBACK to one of the Greatest movies of all time!!!  Please go & see the movie before judging it, and don't be too harsh on it, as nothing will replace the Original Version!  Thanks for reading my review!
0062011847|1.0|I love Pratchett. However, the quality of the finishing of the hardcover book was awful. The paper is cheap and so thin you can see through it. The long edges of the pages aren't finished correctly and have a sawtooth pattern to them. Just horrible.   I'm sure the story will be great, but the quality of the physical product is unacceptable.
B004M66YSA|5.0|This album is insanely beautiful, true and good! Lovely vocals, clever lyrics and insightfully creative music that makes you want to come back and have another listen - again and again!! I highly recommend this!!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Yes you have to use your imagination in the movie. If you want to be spoon-fed gallons of blood and gore, go watch the other 99% of crappy horror movies. The thing about this movie is that you can relate to it in real life. I'm sure everyone has one time or another heard noises in the middle of the night. Sure you know there has to be a logical explanation for it but sometimes, but you do get nervous because you don't know what it could be. With paranormal activity, you get to relieve those exciting moments as a kid when you dared each other to say bloody mary 3X in the mirror or told each other scary camp fire stories. This movie is psychologically scary which is a nice break from the other horror movies where it seems like the more blood used, the scarier its suppose to be. Well, I never related to any moments in my life where I was chased down by dudes with hockey masks so those movies I don't find to be scary. Random noises and crackles or the other hand...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I know a lot of fans such as myself were pissed to hear that Lucas was altering the movies again. I wasn't going to buy this set but couldn't pass it up for 79 bucks. So i gave it a chance. I still love the originals but this box set wasn't horrible. The changes didn't really effect my feelings toward Star Wars or Lucas. In fact I welcomed one of the best changes he did, Yoda. Seriously in EP1 Yoda looked like garbage.
B004LWZW42|2.0|Now granted the X-Men movies have not been written for the fans of the comic books.  That much is obvious.  But this movie just does a huge disservice to both strip and to movie fans.  Besides having terrible dialog and no story line it just blows to bits the entire X-men story. The relationship between Charles and Magneto is completely distorted which is unfortunate for so many reasons.  The acting in this is superficial and Michael Fassbender's portrayal of him as a man on a mission to kill is just wrong.   There is nothing memorable about the cast with January Jones being particularly ineffective. She has the winy, put upon queen role down pat.  The only remotely interesting bit was the cameo by Wolverine which was perfectly played.  Other than that the weak story, bad acting and terrible directing is just not worth it.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|This little program is great for what it is. Even as an adult, just fun to make drawings, be creative. If you aren't in the mood to think about selecting tools, colors, etc, you want this.
0345529057|4.0|Started on this series after watching part of the HBO presentation. 1) I'm very happy to see that HBO is following the story line of the book unlike their True Blood adaptation of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, 2) I've read the first two books of the Song of Ice and Fire series and they are a great read! The author is a wonderful story teller! Now my husband is engrosed in the first book. It's really hard to put them down but I have to postpone reading the last two cuz there are other books and obligations that I must attend to. Can't wait to finish the series but I'm not sure about the fifth book since the reviews haven't been as good.
B0036TGT3E|1.0|Even after updating my Samsung Player (HT-BD7200) with the latest firmware this disc will not be played. I also have the Snow White Diamond Edition and it will not play. All my other Blu-Ray disc play fine. Shame on Disney for putting something on this disc that creates compatibility issues. Called Samsung technical support, but all they can do is say \\"please wait for a firmware update'. I'm not holding my breath.
0545259088|4.0|Forever was a bittersweet read for me. I had become attached to the characters after reading the first two books. While I was excited to read more about their lives, I was also sad that the series was ending. *sigh*   The beginning of Forever focuses on emotions. The story begins oh so slowly and builds from there. Emotions are all over the board as the characters face issues with trust, love, and the future. Maggie Stiefvater's writing is as beautiful as ever and I hung on every word. If you are put off by the slow start, keep reading, it will be worth it. I pinkie promise.  Sam and Grace remain very much in love, but they are kept apart for a good part of the story. I was disappointed that there was not as much attention on these two together. Luckily, Cole and Isabel were there to fill in the void. Cole is such a free-spirit and he just makes me smile. I think there should be a spin-off book based on Cole.  I would pay big dollars for that!   The wolves that inhabit Mercy Falls are given their own time to shine. I really liked reading about their lifestyle, how they interacted, and how they formed bonds.  In an odd sort of way, I think we could all learn from the wolves and how they structure their pack. And then there's the way the wolves were seen by the humans.  Some humans wanted the wolves dead, while others would risk their lives for them.   Expect flawless writing and familiar characters in this final chapter of The Wolves of Mercy Falls series.  If you are like me, you will get a bit sentimental as you say goodbye on the final page.  RATING  4 Liked  COVER COMMENTS  I love the style of the covers to this series. It's great to have a white background for a wolf book. So, who's the wolf and who's the human this time? I am glad the cover is maroon and not a bright red. Oh, and the maroon font inside the book is great too!
031265068X|1.0|AFTER CAREFULLY READING THIS BOOK, I AM LEFT WITH NO DOUBT THE AUTHOR SET OUT TO \\"SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT\\" FOR MARC RICH. HIS WRITING IS MORE LIKE A PUBLIC RELATIONS ENDEAVOUR ON BEHALF OF HIS \\"CLIENT\\" MARCH RICH TO POSITION HIM IN BETTER LIGHT AND REDEEM HIS REPUTATION IN THE PUBLIC EYE. HE HAS NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMNT. HE SPENDS INORDINATE AMOUNTS OF TIME RECOUNTING MARC RICH'S PHILANTHROPY IN ISRAEL \\"TO SHOW THE SUNNY SIDE' OF A MAN WHO HAD NO SCRUPLES DOING BUSINESS WITH UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE AND REGIMES THE WORLD OVER. HE SHOWS HIS ANTIPATHY TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN HE STATES THAT \\"ALL WE DO IS EXPORT LEVI JEANS, ROCK AND ROLL AND HAMBURGERS! THAT IS BEYOND LUNACY BUT IT SHOWS THE MINDSET OF THE AUTHOR IN HIS DEMONISING THE COUNTRY THAT GOES AFTER A FELLOW THAT FELT INCLINED TO SKIP TOWN INSTEAD OF PAYING THE PIPER HIS JUST DUES! HOW MUCH DID MARCH RICH PAY THE AUTHOR FOR THIS INFORMERCIAL? I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYBODY SPEND THEIR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.
1402713185|4.0|Abridged, still some words that need translating for young kids.  The gist of the story is still there, kids love it.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|It was really great to get my purchase quickly and for a really great price. And it was in awesome condition.
B000001GQD|5.0|As far as Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2 goes, I have had no problem with the old age of the recording. It's a great rendition of the song and is better than the rendition that I attended at SPAC last this summer by the Philadelphia Orchestra. The quality is wonderful, musically and sound-wise. I've always loved the big romantic melodies of Rachmaninov and this recording will not disappoint.   As far as Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, it is one of the better renditions I've heard of the song, and also has the same quality as Piano Concerto No. 2. There is no sound difference between the two, which is a plus. As you can see I got the CD for Rachmaninoff, but Tchaikovsky was a nice treat to be included on the CD. Both concertos are brilliant and I recommend this CD to anyone.
B004L07KWQ|3.0|lack of instructions in the app is disappointing. it is fun to use and i like the straight lines you can drag and make digital sculptures as you drag your fingers across the screen. that is a cool feature.
1400069181|5.0|I just finished this book and found it be very inspiring. Yes, there's some business info to it but the core is in helping out others and from that business can grow.    I enjoyed reading how Toms started - and what it stands for.  It will make you want to buy a pair to support the One For One.  Oh, and when buying this book, One For One also applies. A child in need will receive a book. Can't fault that.
B002KVSJ7S|5.0|I just fell in love head over heels with Mika when I heard the whole album.   I didn't really knew who he was, although I remember enjoying \\"Relax\\" and (specially) \\"Grace Kelly\\" when they played on the radio. I found this CD (deluxe edition) in my daughter's car and got addicted to it instantly. I think he's a genius as a writer/composer and a truly gifted singer.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest movies of all time! i have to say, they should not have made this movie in 3D. in was to blury to watch.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Always one of my favorite super heroes as a kid, I loved this adaption brought to the screen. Can't wait for the Avengers follow-up.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|even since i was a kid this was one of my favorite movies of all time i glad that they release this movie on to bluray and dvd!
B004L07KWQ|1.0|Would love for the app to be set up correct. It will not get rid of the clear screen so there is a waste of $1. Guess I will have to work on getting my $1 back.
B005NPBTQ6|4.0|When I first heard Ashes @ Fire, I thought-This is not The Ryan Adams I Love to hear. It is clearly a love album  to his Wife; and perhaps- growing up? After listening over again I hear the brilliance in this album. It's not   your typical Ryan Adams, But nevertheless a soulful and loving tribute to love. When you're feeling down and need soulful restoration- Listen to this!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Can't live without Breaking Bad.  Never a dull moment, each episode gets more creative.  Edge of your seat stuff requires thought, creates emotion.
B004EPZ070|5.0|This movie is great! It has a great story to it, but besides the main story there are some side stories going on that are quite humorous in their own right. I saw this in the movie theatre, ondemand, bought it and already watched it 3 more times. I just can't get enough of this movie its great from beginning to end!
B005ELZNH0|5.0|As a Hugh Miles fan, this set is amazing.  The packaging, sound and liner notes made for an excellent weekend of re-discovery.  Highly recommend.

0446547654|4.0|The book was captivating and I couldn't put it down, but I hated the ending and I will not see the movie and cry all over again.  I get so mad at Nicholas Sparks for writing these tear jerkers.  I like happy endings.

006112429X|5.0|What a terrific read: brilliant writing, well-developed and interesting characters, masterful story-telling...I haven't read a book this original and compelling in ages. Plus, so dark!<br /><br />After reading some of the other reviews, I gave my own impressions of this book more thought. Perhaps I mistook the author's decent vocabulary for good writing skills? Maybe the characters weren't as fleshed out as I had thought; was Eva not only shallow but one-dimensional, as well? Was Kevin a cliche? Was the plot twist a surprise only to me?<br /><br />After consideration, I've come to this: no, no, no, no, and no.<br /><br />I thought Shriver's storytelling was masterful: character development is one of the most important aspects of a story for me, and I thought Eva was as developed a character as I've met in a long time. Was she likeable? Not always: self-involved, shallow, pedantic. Me, too, sometimes. In my view, perfect people are not terribly interesting...and even if they were, there'd be that pesky problem of being able to relate to them. Flaws, to a point, I understand. Then there's Kevin.<br /><br />I loved how Shriver made Kevin so foreign; his \\"other-ness\\" made the depth of his evil less far-fetched...and all the more chilling.<br /><br />The more I think about it, the more impressed I am with this book. Two thumbs up.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Works well with a Canon 7D and is a major improvement over the internal mic. It does have a cheap feel to it but I don't expect any problems, it's just a subjective impression. Performance is great and the price is certainly reasonable. I give it five stars based on price/performance ratio.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I read this on the recommendation of family and friends; as expected, \\"Sarah's Key\\" did not disappoint, though there were a few issues that kept me from giving it a five-star rating.<br /><br />First, the pros: I love when a story grabs the reader right away and Sarah's Key did just that. I liked the dual plotlines, and the author did an excellent job weaving the two plots together. The writing was clear and fairly simple, never needlessly complicated. Though parts of the story were very heartwrenching, it was never depressing. I found myself looking for reasons to read...and, for me, \\"compelling\\" generally equals \\"good\\", and in that regard, this book was very, very good.<br /><br />Now for the cons: This is the book's biggest problem for me: I couldn't stand the main character, Julia. I couldn't relate to her, I didn't want to relate to her, and, mostly, I wanted to pinch her. Her, and her mature-beyond-her-years daughter, Zoe. Julia's husband, Bertrand, isn't on my top-ten list, either, but at least he bore a few qualities I could relate to. So that's the big flaw for me, the main characters. I also didn't like (this shall be vague to avoid spoilers) the not-so-subtle references to \\"the child\\" towards the end...yack, like there was ANY surprise to be had there. I also would have loved for Sarah's story to have been more fleshed out (or, perhaps, the book's ONLY story, and have Julia left out altogether): I would have loved more backstory in France, what got her to America. I wanted to know more about Sarah than that author gave me: how, for example, did she meet her husband? How did she manage bonding with her American family?<br /><br />Perhaps the point was for the reader to be driven to wonder, much as Julia had. Realizing that doesn't make me like her any better, it just makes me want to pinch her a little harder.
0975991477|1.0|While completely disrespecting scientists who actually use the scientific method to prove their hypotheses, Bruce Lipton makes wild and ridiculous claims with no evidence. He does a silly tap dance of overreaching logic to reach his conclusions, but even someone with a basic grasp of science could recognize him for the charlatan that he is. Don't waste your money unless you want to hear Lipton's endless and embarrassing ego trip.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|Works as advertised on Moto Droid2. Still cant give 5 stars just because it gets annoying quickly not being able to choose or keep a single color. But it is colorful and easy.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I love this album. Every track is beautiful, precise and feeds my soul. I hope Biophilia concert comes to America so that I can experience her live again.
B005MP28B2|5.0|This movie was truly amazing. It obtained some of the best cinematography that I have ever seen in my life. You could tell how much thought was put into each second of each scene. From beginning to end it is a beautiful and moving piece of art. If you are expecting to see a mainstream Brad Pitt Hollywood film, this is NOT a movie for you. If you are open minded enough to be able to understand, it will touch your heart and lift your spirits...make you think... It reminded me to take a deeper look within the fabrics of life---to appreciate once again, and to deeply love the wondrous power of the universe.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Oh NO...It's a GRUFFALO!  The Gruffalo has got to be the most beaten up book on my kids bookshelf.  Translated: The most read book on my kids bookshelf.   And not only because my kids love it, but because every time they ask me to pick a book to read to them, it's the book I go for too. (Yes, it's that hypnotic!)   This best-selling children's book was introduced August 16th on DVD  and really had a lot to live up to.   If you've read the charming rhymes in The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson, and seen the amazing artwork byAxel Scheffler, you'll understand what I mean.   The story of an adorable little mouse out-witting three predators who want to eat him, coupled with a monster from his imagination that comes to life, definitely calls for some fun.   And, I will say, the motion picture delivered, and then some!  The Academy Award nominated film was narrated by Helena Bonham Carter (from Harry Potter), and features voices of an all-star cast.   You really get to watch the characters develop, and see more of their personalities. The visuals are stunning, and you can tell they worked really, really hard to make sure that the animated version lived up to the magic of the original book.   Two thumbs way up!   The Gruffalo is going to be cast as a truly timeless children's classic.   My kids are going to watch this DVD over and over, until it's no longer playable.   That's just a fact.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Why in the works would Warner brothers release a digital copy that is not compatible with the most popular music service in tHe world iTunes?  What a huge mistake and by the looks from the reviews on here I'm not the only one. Don't mess with the digital copy! If its not broke don't fix it. No more Warner brothers titles till they fix this nonsense.
0802473156|5.0|The subject of this book is the fundamental tread trough everything in life. It is the root for everything the Christian Bible tries to teach us but unfortunately just a few are able to see. This is life that the civilized western culture has long forgotten and i believe its important that we all relearn what love really is.  To love is to live and this book teaches you how to.
B000654YK6|5.0|It came in great shape, and it worked flawlessly so far. I've only watched part of it (well @3 quarters of it) and I've got to say that it's great. One of the nest underground music bios I've ever seen. Period. the music on it.The bands, some big named Seattle bands )don't plan on seeing  the video or hearing \\"SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT\\" ..!!!! That's not what it's about. It's about the 'truth' of these bands,where they come from, and why they came at all..
1585427683|4.0|Excellent book. Its a easy read and keeps you interested not only in the amazing story's but techniques showing you and teaching you how to change your life for the better.
B005DZMP00|5.0|It's about time more of this tour is being officially released and this is no disappointment.  While disc 1 would sound equal to a side 7 and 8 to the EUROPE '72 album, disc 2 sounds almost LIVE DEADish in it's revelatory explorations.  One could only wonder what the audience felt hearing a wordless (until the end) Dark Star segueing into some Drums and then into The Other One, almost an hour of pure outer space as only the Dead at their peak could achieve.  I'll be listening to both discs but probably in my full-moon phases #2 hits the player more often.  This is the best recent release from the vaults and a fantastic companion to the original.
B005OC5CLQ|3.0|I love Scotty's voice, I really do, and I was pulling for him from the 1st audition on AI.  I was thrilled to purchase this album, but once I listened to it, I find it kind of boring.  I was hoping for more oomph to it, but leaves me feeling like it is just okay.  For my taste, there is more slower tempo songs than I would like from a young'un like Scotty.  Hopefully, in future, his music will reflect some of his youth.
B004L07KWQ|3.0|Take a photo, it will become your background. Now paint. Try impressionist methods, tap repeatedly for dots. Or make straight lines by touching two points at once (is this by design or did the author choose to not impliment multipoint touch?). Now use the select color fill icon. Your real life picture will be removed and you will be left with your drawing. It's like a electronic version of trace paper. Fun.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have tried P90X before and made it through the 1st 30 days, but that was when I was 30 pounds lighter and had more time. Those videos are for usually an hour every day and they are hard work. I have to say that Jillian Michaels is a beast and I was not expecting the workout to be quite that hard. I started on the 1st level and made it probably 2/3 of the way through. These videos are about 20 minutes each which is great for time when you are short on it. The workout is fast paced and keeps you moving. You move from cardio to strength to abs and then repeat 2 times. I am actually sore today and  I just tried it for the first time yesterday. I am certain I will be more fit after 30 days!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I can only but recommend all and everyone to read this suggestive, unreal but yet so realistic book about the Journalist, Blomkvist. Don't see the movie. read the book. Preferably in Swedish if you endure the rough northern european language. It simply is a page-turner. Unfortunately, Stieg Larsson died young and before concluding the remaining 7 books.
0307405095|5.0|I was THRILLED to see this book arrive as I am a \\" cake and bread baker\\" and in my yrs of baking,,,,,  I can probably count the number of pies I have made on one hand~<br />Shameful ,,,,and I considered myself a \\"baker\\"??<br /><br /> I have made it a priority this year to bake favorite pies for birthdays , home celebrations , picnics and potlucks ~ I thought it was high time I face this challenge head on .  I  bought tiny pie tins for the children's pies after picking a load of apples from our small orchard<br /><br /> I do think the addition of fruit  in many pies/tarts has a healthier edge than heavy layer cakes which I had made for so many years~ and of course, one can control the sweetness~<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of the first tart I made which was the peach and berry tart.( First chapter)<br /> It is easily made  up in only a few minutues, then baked~I baked this for DH to take to a men's breakfast at church ~<br />It was so pretty that someone said it looked more like decoration than dessert!  And it was my FIRST tart! But the TASTE was even better!( he saved a piece for me) I did use the called for addition of cornmeal to the tart crust and it did have a great flavor in an all fruit tart which is now my favorite tart!<br />The tart looked GORGEOUS and made it look like I was an expert pie baker , I can assure you I am not!<br />  I did things a bit different tho, and I am assuming for the most part a lot of the pies are subject to individual taste~ I made this in an 8\\" tart pan( because it looked prettier!) and added a few nectarines in w/ the peaches, which made for an excellant taste~<br />I DID however have to add more than double sugar suggested, and I do not have a huge sweet tooth , so maybe the fruit pies are way way under the sweetness range for me?? But perhaps not for you~<br />I have had tarts in Europe and do realize that they do use less sugar all the way around except for maybe Austria or Germany?<br /><br />I  had to double the amount of time baking this tart even tho my oven temp is spot on,, I did have some pie covers that I had collected( and never used!) that I topped over the very crust so the top would not get burned,,,,,so far,,so good,,,<br />I think this is all part of the learning curve for me b/c the apple pies and pumpkin pies came out perfect as per recipe in the book.<br /><br />I won't give a whole list of the pies, other reviewers have been kind enough to do so,,but I will say as my confidence in pie making grows I will be happily baking  those birthday PIES  this year ~ my favorite is mile high lemon,,,,,DH, cherry pie from our own trees. I really wanted to master pie making as we grow a TON of cherries, berries and have a lot of fruit trees that have now matured enough to bear a lot,,,,,so now is THE time!<br /> And , being so blessed to have a mini orchard on our land, I wanted to USE it to its best potential b/c the price of fruit is getting higher by the week. I am hoping to look up to see if I can freeze a pie  unbaked) so I can have a fresh pie to go when we have people over for a quick brunch or dinner, I have heard this can be done but will have to look at this further  has anyone done this successfully I wonder?)<br /><br />I cannot see how any baker could be bored with this book , it is a gorgeous COLLECTION of many pies one can bake and the photograpy is stunning~( so you can see just how your pie is to look finished!  Some of us NEED this.... which is often missing in cookbooks or e recipes<br />I like inspiration, and to see what I can bake w/ what I happen to have on hand in any particular season ,as I said, we grow a lot of berries and cherries that I used to freeze for toppings to cakes which is kind of sad now that I think of it~<br /> While I work my way thru the pie book I will be careful to taste fruits and berries, and even cremes so I am certain they are up to my taste level<br />I do think that it will only be a taste thing with the fruit tho~<br />Only one problem,,,,,THE famous \\" Elegant Farmer Pie\\" baked in a brown bag  which has been on cooking shows to compete with) has never been duplicated w/ accuracy yet!<br />I know, I live a few miles from where they make this great pie  but I am sure going to  look it up on the net.<br />Love love love the book! My husband is also happy, because it is true,many people are  pie lovers first and cake lovers second~ One big disclaimer here,,,,I do NOT eat much sugar , I my eat pie maybe 3 times a year?? But I LOVE to bake and bake I do,,,,,for others!<br />This book is a very good thing~
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Though not en pair with the first two books in the trilogy, it is still worthwhile reading. It is a bit more predictable and makes the heroes more heroic than the first two books and maybe it is a backlash. If the book would be stand-alone it could very well hold better.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I did not find this memoir worth the time and I did not even finish it! . I thought this would be really funny so I checked out the audio at my library but could not even get through the first hour. I did not find it funny at all so I quit listening to it. It just didn't seem to go anywhere with no real story line. I was hugely disappointed.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I personally found this book to be best of the three. It had a lot of unexpected turns and it made the characters tougher. Lisbeth Savander continues to marvel in how disconnected socially she is and what created her to become so.<br /><br />Once I started reading, I could not stop until 6-7 hours later, when the book was finished and I was just dying to get my hands of the last one.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I could not put this book down.  After reading it, I wanted to plant a flower garden just so I could send messages to people.  I had been looking for something interesting to read for a while, and I downloaded a sample of this to see if it lived up to the hype it had been receiving and I should've just bought it.  Amazing debut, I can't wait to see more from the author.

B000N3ST7A|5.0|Crystal Visions The Very Best Of Stevie Nicks is an excellent album.I ordered this album last Sunday and got it this past Thursday and it is just great to absorb. Stevie Nicks is a true virtuoso on her greatest hits cd and each song says it. The song I treasure the most is her cover of rock group Led Zeppelin's song Rock And Roll. She did a superb job singing that live. Rock And Roll says all ears on me that's how good it sounds along with the beat. Edge Of Seventeen is very hot and exciting as well as the other 14 songs. I'm so happy I decided to by some Stevie Nicks because I've never had any music by her before. I'm very proud of Stevie's greatest songs.They are a real treasure for a lifetime.
0786891416|3.0|Heat Wave by Richard Castle is a novel idea, no pun intended.  As a fan of the ABC television show Castle, this appealed to me right away.  The idea of it being a fictional book, set in a fictional world, written by a fictional author from a fictional show was very interesting.  While the overall plot of this pretty run of the mill and by the books its still fun.  My big drawback here was that as a fan of the show I kept comparing the characters here to there and vice versa.  Why that was bad was that the TV characters were better.  I think if you had no connection to the show you might not get some of the in jokes but you also may be able to judge it solely on its own merits.  Overall I guess this is just an average book but a fantastic idea.
1400069181|4.0|It's taken me a while to get around to reviewing this book because every chapter has sent me off on a tangent of investigation into what I can do to start something important.  I have so much information pouring in, I nearly forgot that the review still needed to be written.<br /><br />Start Something That Matters is on the surface the story of the conception, gestation, and fruition of TOMS shoes, the brilliant plan to both manufacture decent shoes, market those shoes to people who can make things happen, and in the end, donate a pair of shoes for free to shoeless children for each pair purchased.  Talk about win-win-win!  Granted, there was a good deal of luck and magical inspiration involved, but that makes the process all the more intriguing.  It's impossible to read the story without letting one's mind wander to grand ideas that have been lurking there unaddressed.<br /><br />Beyond Chapter one and the birth of TOMS, Blake Mycoskie shares his philosophy and rational advice.  As I happened to be listening to an audio book on a similar subject at the same time, I find that my mind is spinning in new ways and can't wait to see where it will stop and what wondrous achievements will result.<br /><br />The book is fun to read, inspirational, and full of concrete information and advice.  If you harbor any fantasies of creating The Next Big Thing, this book is a must.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|An excellent reflection of the book. Kristen Scott Thomas was the perfect choice to play Julia, the journalist who could not stop until she discovered the whole story behind the apartment her husband's family has taken from Sarah's in 1942. I don't wish to spoil the plot any further, but the movie is well worth watching.
0061714402|5.0|Loved it , long over due and very fun to read. Megadeth and Dave fans this is a must.<br />I grew up with Megadeth and I always thought they are better then Selloutica, mettallica. Megadeth rules and getting Dave Mustaine's side is vindication for his fans as well.<br />Good Job Mr. Mustaine.<br />I am in my 40's now but have been a fan of the band since 17 when I first saw them live.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Amazing story. The entire story sums up what was left of The Lost Hero. This book has typos, but text is still understandable. This book should be bought by everyone, for any age. But the stupid cliffhanger Rick Riordan did at the end... REALLY???
B005LJITS0|4.0|I have read the original comic books.  The base storyline and concepts are definately present in this movie. There are several reviews slashing this movie to pieces, but at the end of the day its about entertainment.  Needless to say, if you are a hardcore comic book reader, this movie may miss the mark with the original seriousness of the Green Lantern story.  This movie was created to appeal to all audiences; those familiar with the original story, and those who are new to the franchise.  I found it entertaining, which is all I ask in a movie anymore.
B004ZN9NCY|5.0|Pink Floyd's fourth (and first double) album entitled Ummagumma was released in November of 1969.<br />This double album is basically two albums in one package. The title of the album is an old Cambridgeshire slang term for a word I cannot use.<br />I first got this album as a Christmas present from my paternal grandmother whom unfortunately passed away on Valentine's Day 2004 on cassette (which, on the US version, was missing three live tracks present on the CD and LP issues) in 1987. Then, I first acquired on CD in August, 1991 with the full album (to hear the live tracks which were wrongly excised from the cassette).<br />The first disc is a live album that the band recorded at a club called Mothers in Birmingham, England and the Manchester College of Commerce in Manchester, England in April and June of 1969 respectively.<br />The first track is a wonderful, extended reading of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" this time featuring keyboard player Rick Wright singing the lower parts Syd originally sang and guitarist/singer David Gilmour singing the higher harmonies. The song is a great showpiece for David's excellent guitar work and Rick's fantastic keyboard work. Next is \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\" (deleted from the original US cassette issue) which is more sinister and longer than the hurried studio version with bass player/vocalist Roger Waters' demonic screaming and excellent drumming from drummer Nick Mason and excellent playing by Wright and Gilmour as well.<br />\\"Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun\\" (also deleted from the original US cassette issue) follows and buries the studio version once again featuring extra keyboard work by Rick whom was one of the best keyboard players in rock history (although unjustly overlooked) and Roger sang this track with more passion. The first disc ends with \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" (blasphemously deleted from the original US cassette issue) which surpasses the studio version although I love the version from Pompeii too. The ending section of Saucerful is way different than the studio as Rick's organ is this time joined by bass guitar, drums, electric guitar and David's scat vocal making it more of a jam than a funeral hymn that was on the studio version.<br />Disc two consists of a solo piece or two by the four band members and came about because of Rick's frustrations with doing just rock music. We start this with Rick Wright's solo piece was the four-part \\"Sysyphus\\" which features Rick's jazz and classical influences and his keyboard work on the mellotron and piano and organ gives me a shiver down the spine each time I hear it (some may call it pretentious but I love it). Roger has two solo pieces. First, is the folk-tinged acoustic number \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" which was his song about his childhood in Cambridge and was the third song he ever had a lead vocal (Stethoscope on Piper and Set the Controls on Saucerful were his other two lead vocal tracks by then). Next, was the avant-garde tape effect with Scottish dialect rant laden \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict\\".<br />David Gilmour for his solo piece combined his rock, blues and folk influences in the three part \\"The Narrow Way\\". The first part was preliminarily recorded on the BBC as \\"Baby Blue Shuffle\\" in early 1969. Then part 2 is Gilmour displaying his guitar and bass guitar playing with tape effects. Then part 3 has Gilmour's vocal plus David singing harmonies with himself plus he plays guitars, bass guitar and he also handles drums and keyboards (his drum and keyboard debut on record by the way). The Narrow Way is, hands down, my favorite solo piece on the second disc. The solo disc ends with Nick Mason's three part \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" which is a Nick Mason drum solo and shows that he is a great drummer. Nick's then wife Lindy did the flute solos on the intro and outro sections.<br />Ummagumma was Pink Floyd's first album to crack in the U.S. Top 100 on Billboard peaking at #74 in early 1970 (thanks in part due to word of mouth and college kids blasting out of their dormatories back them) and the album eventually went Gold in early 1974 (after the success of Dark Side of the Moon) and eventually Platinum (in March, 1994).<br />In 2011, as part of the Why Pink Floyd? campaign, the album is re-released in a remastered version which is (to my ears) an improvement on the 1994/95 remaster which sounded lifeless (even the 1980s Capitol/EMI CD was better than the 1990s remaster) and also comes with booklet featuring credits, photos and COMPLETE LYRICS (even including the lyrics to \\"The Narrow Way\\" which was absent from the 1990s remaster).<br />If you like the Floyd from 1973 forward then you may be turned off by some of the pieces but if you are a hardcore Floyd fan and/or have an open ear like myself, I highly recommend this album.early 1970 (thanks in part due to word of mouth and college kids blasting out of their dormatories back them) and the album eventually went Gold in early 1974 (after the success of Dark Side of the Moon) and eventually Platinum (in March, 1994).   In 2011, as part of the Why Pink Floyd? campaign, the album is re-released in a remastered version which is (to my ears) an improvement on the 1994/95 remaster which sounded lifeless (even the 1980s Capitol/EMI CD was better than the 1990s remaster) and also comes with booklet featuring credits, photos and COMPLETE LYRICS (even including the lyrics to \\"The Narrow Way\\" which was absent from the 1990s remaster).  If you like the Floyd from 1973 forward then you may be turned off by some of the pieces but if you are a hardcore Floyd fan and/or have an open ear like myself, I highly recommend this album.
0240815807|5.0|This is a great book, and one that will be referred to/referenced for a long time.  I've been writing/recording for a while, and this book is definitely what I needed: Something that's a little over my head but not so much that it loses me...but enough that I'll be learning from it for a long time.  This is -exactly- what I'd hoped for.  I'm reading this with a pencil in hand, underlining important things as I go, and there's a lot of important things.   Also what I'd hoped for.  I am only a quarter way through the book, so I cannot comment from te perspective of one who's finished it, but already I'm getting the feeling that this will be the last mixing-related book I'll be buying for a long time.  I bought this book after reading several reviews that spoke very highly of this book. That was completely necessary as I'm pretty tight w/my money.  I'm happy to say it was actually a \\"smart\\" purchase, in my mind.
B000006TRV|5.0|This and Dark Side of the Moon are my two favorite albums of all time.  Incredible lyrics by Roger Waters, stunning guitar solos by David Gilmour, and some of the best vocals ever.  Also great job Richard Wright (we will miss you!) and Nick Mason!  Check on Remember That Night DVD - an absolute must have in your Pink Floyd - David Gilmour collection.  This was Richard Wright's last tour.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie is great and powerful.  I really wished that Professor Snape put his years of hating James Potter aside to get to know Harry Potter but it's too late. I am hoping that there will be next Hogwarts Train to come back to Hogwarts with next generation of Potters and everyone if J.K. Rowlings are going to write new book.<br />Great movie and it will be strange by not seeing new Harry Potter movie next year.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Give it 6 stars! The best concert I have ever seen.  Remember That Night is just way better than I could have ever imagined.  I just can't stop watching it!  David Gilmour especially put on one of the greatest performances of his career and proved yet again that he is one of the top guitarists of all time.  His guitar solos on Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Coming Back to Life are just two of the highlights of this incredible show and even better than the original studio recordings.  Plus the cool videos of them rehearsing and the concert tour. Not to mention having great performances by David Crosby and Graham Nash.  And Richard Wright...he was also incredible and we will miss him greatly.  The rock music world will not be the same without him.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great Movie for ages 10 (?) and up.  I think it will really help teens think about the choices they make a little bit more.  This was such an inspiring story.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Fantastic CD and DVD.  Jason Mraz is very talented and keeps the audience hopping. Great versions of the cover songs and of his own music.  What a FUN time.  Highly recommended for all music lovers.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|When I first saw the preview for this on The Disney Channel, I was not too thrilled.  Though I love Bridgette Mendler on \\"Good Luck Charlie\\", I just wasn't sure about the movie.  Then I started to see some of her videos, and realized, hey, this girl can sing!!  So, I rented the movie on DVD and I have to tell you, I'm very glad that I did. I liked it so much that I ordered the DVD combo pack from Amazon.com the very next day.<br />This is a very fun movie, with lots of laughs and tons of heart, not to mention some awesome songs.<br />So don't hesitate, this one will have you tapping your toes.<br />[[ASIN:B004QIG7CW Lemonade Mouth (DVD + Digital Copy)]]
159420229X|5.0|Review by Steven King, MBA, MEd<br /><br />Have you ever wondered who the world's smartest person is?  In a world that celebrates the antics of the world's strongest people very little time is given to those who excel in mental pursuits. Such antipathy for mental prowess put Joshua Foer on a quest to find out who might fit the bill of world's smartest person.  When he began his quest, he did not discover who the smartest person was in the world...rather he was introduced to the world of the mental athletes.<br /><br />Foer's path crossed with the like of memory champions Ben Pridemore, who could memorize gargantuan amounts of numerical digits and the layout of five decks of cards in just a few minutes. Such mental prowess piqued Foer's curiosity and set the journalist within ablaze to discover all he could about their techniques.  His quest propelled him along a path which would ultimately culminate in his competition in the U.S. Memory Championship.<br /><br />This trek placed him in the pathway of interesting individuals--such as Britain's Tony Buzan, an educational consultant who is credited with developing the \\"mind mapping\\" technique of taking notes.  After meeting with Buzan, Foer enlisted the help of a youthful United Kingdom memory competitor, Ed Cooke, to coach him and prepare him for the U.S. Memory Championship.  At Ed's behest, Foer dove into available literature--finding references to mnemonic techniques from around the fifth century BC.  Not wanting to leave any stone unturned, Foer also tracks down Kim Peek, the inspiration for the character in Dustin Hoffman's Rain Main, to determine if there were any memory techniques he could glean from an obvious savant..<br /><br />Foer unearthed techniques many refer to as building a memory palace which allowed him to \\"store\\" information spatially along routes of which he was familiar.  Want to learn a list of 75 words? No problem. Imagine walking through your house and assigning these words in bizarre contexts (include the most sensory stimulation you can) along the pathway. Suppose the first item is an aardvark...you might place the inconspicuous fellow outside your mailbox juggling the second word you need to remember.  Then, when called upon to regurgitate the list you would simply walk through these pre-constructed locations and recall the mental images. Foer used this very technique to place in key events and ultimately win the 2006 National Memory Championship.  Not only did he win, he set a new U.S. record by memorizing a deck of playing cards in a minute and 40 seconds.<br /><br />Although the title seems a little bizarre, it is not until you are reading his blow-by-blow account of the championship that you realize that one of his \\"mental images,\\" was Foer moonwalking with Einstein to help remember a playing card.  After the championship, Foer settled back into journalism and is not sure that his overall memory was changed very much.<br /><br />This book is commended as a good read of an interesting memory challenge.<br /><br />But wait, where did I put my car keys?(include the most sensory stimulation you can) along the pathway.

0062112430|5.0|A part of me is attracted to dystopians, but the other part of me is horribly afraid of them. Paranormals frighten me sometimes, but I'm 99.9% sure that vampires, werewolves and other supernatural baddies are not lurking in the shadows of the night waiting for a chance to jump out and do evil things to me, so it doesn't hit me too close. But controlling and strict governments? That's a possibility and it freaks me the hell out. And the version of the United States that the main character Lena lives in is seriously effed up.<br /><br />I started writing this review earlier today, got busy and took off for a while and now here I am again writing and I'm still thinking fondly of it. Lena started out as a very frustrating character. I totally understand her reasoning, especially in retrospect, but there were times where I wanted to reach in and strangle some sense to her. Her agreeable stance was mind boggling. Of course, when you grow up a certain way it is hard to come to grips with a different reality or accept change. Especially change that big.<br /><br />I think what I found especially interesting about Delirium was the religious aspects, the way Lauren Oliver depicted Christianity being twisted into something that helps control or influence the population. It's something that has happened in the past and I found it interesting how that tied in. It wasn't a huge part of the story, just a little thing I noticed - so the book is by no means religious, but it made total sense.<br /><br />I really loved the development and romance between Lena and Alex. It wasn't love at first sight and I felt it developed at a good rate - I even thought at one point, \\"dude, are they gonna hook up or whaaaat?\\" And I loved Lena's best friend Hana. In the beginning she's really the only breath of fresh air because Lena is such a stick in the mud and so focused on getting rid of the disease of love.<br /><br />Overall I really, really liked this book. It had a really good and imaginative story, the characters were done very well, and it made me think and consider a lot. Well done, Lauren Oliver!<br /><br />P.S. THERE IS AN EPIC CLIFFHANGER AT THE END OF THIS BOOK. If those bother you, which it did me a little (not exactly in a horrible way, but I'm just very eager to read the next book) you might want to wait a little to read it closer to the next books release date!ell, and it made me think and consider a lot. Well done, Lauren Oliver!   P.S. THERE IS AN EPIC CLIFFHANGER AT THE END OF THIS BOOK.

1594744769|3.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children intrigued me the first time I saw the book cover. That girl in the photo on the cover floating, peculiar-looking, damaged. What was that all about?<br /><br />I loved Amazon's video teaser for the book. The old mansion against the sepia-toned background and the creepy music playing was exactly the atmosphere I wanted to experience. The book delivered until about one third of the way through, when once-malevolent mysteries gave way to camaraderie and a shared purpose. What started out as creepy suspense and perhaps horror veered off into the land of sci fi. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But I wanted a creepy ghost story and a haunted house tale, and that's not what I got. I wouldn't call it \\"bait and switch\\"; it's just that the author had different plans for his characters than I did.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read, though. Riggs went all the way with a beginning-level creative writing class exercise, where the student has to make up a story to accompany photos handed out by the instructor. I give it a solid 3.5 stars.
B005VMVUAQ|4.0|Both Nics have done their best again. I love this movie. All artists have performed well and good screen play. Very exciting and thrilled. I would say a definite one time watch.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this little sharpener surprisingly(to me) works very well.  I use it to sharpen scissors(with some special considerations, you have to tip the single edge scissors to one side), and my leatherman tools.<br /><br />even with a battered, deformed edge, you can pull the knife blade through the carbide, and it will cut a new edge on the blade.  Once you do that, you finish it with the ceramic side.<br /><br />this process couldn't be more simple.  Just be careful not to let your fingers slip onto the blade.<br /><br />I've put into my backpack for field sharpening.<br /><br />This one is a no brainer, for outdoor enthusiasts, hunters, and especially survivalists as a back up in the field.  For the money, it probably can't be beat.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|it's pretty boring when playing against the computer it seems like you just keep touching the screen and don't get to make many choices, but when played with others it is almost as good as the real thing
B00003CXCT|3.0|There were skips on the VI series.  Had to work around them.  The product must not have been previewed before reselling.  I did not buy these as new.  All in all, I was satisfied though.
B004L07KWQ|3.0|just ok not something i would keep on my phone take up more space than i'd like. so i tried it and then got rid of it good thing i got it free
B002JVWRAO|5.0|It's amazing. Later in the series it turns more religious, very religous but even as an athiest I enjoy it. My 2nd favorite Series.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This movie captures my childhood memories in a modern DVD package! Great buy for a low price. Very highly recommended for smart buyers.
B004L07KWQ|2.0|I have two vanilla Android 2.2 devices with 480x8** displays, multitouch, accelerometers, cameras, etc. and yet this app is only compatible with one of them?  What gives?  Let me guess, there's a &quot;tablet&quot; version I'm supposed to get for my 7&quot; even though it's spec'd like a phone and incapable of running Honeycomb apps.   I would expect this kind of nonsense from the REAL Android Market (that didn't come preinstalled on my mini-tablet) but not from the alternative app store that's trying to gain popularity.  5 stars less 3 for inserting false limitations to try and milk people for extra money.
082221718X|4.0|This edition was very well done, and I applaud the efforts of the Ms. Kesselman to use the most powerful parts of Anne's diary to stay truthful to the story. However, as a HS theatre director, this is not one that I could use in my class without pause. It uses some sexually charged passages from Anne's diary, making it a little awkward to tell this heart-rending story on a HS stage. I think I will go back to the previous version for my students.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This movie is the best. It was like brand new as they told me. I will kip all my new movies:p this people are the best!!
B002BWP49M|5.0|I absolutley love both the Twilight books/movies and the Hunger Games books series but for you out there that haven't read any of the Hunger Games books I'll tell you they are 1000% better the Twilight ever thought of being. The first Hunger Games Movie will even be out sometime next year but pleaase read the books first. I've read alot of books in my lifetime and I can without a dought list all 3 Hunger Games books in my top 3 books that I've ever read.
0470601787|5.0|I'm not entirely new to using graphics in organizations, and I'm not particularly good at drawing.  But I like to use my limited visuals in meetings (or even conversations in my office) to organize information, ideas, metaphors, and relationships.  So, Sibbet's book has prompted new ideas for using visuals in all sorts of settings -- one's I wouldn't have thought of. I didn't buy it looking for drawing technique.  I didn't buy it looking for graphical display of information like Edward Tufte.  I bought it more to help me thing how to organize and convey information so that people can better understand complex relationships, sequences, processes. I didn't mind the storytelling about Sibbett's client examples, as did another reviewer. I liked seeing the application.  And the bonus was getting insight into Sibbet's thinking when he's working with groups, not just how to use visuals. It's lit a fire under me for new ways to consider graphics in conversations -- small and large.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Caesar the protagonist of this movie is a product of hundreds of animal testing of an experimental drug to treat Alzheimer patients.  James Franco, the scientist researching the drug,  has a personal stake in the matter because his father is suffering from the debilitating disease. When Caesar defends the father from an unruly neighbor, he is rounded up by animal control and placed in an animal prison run by a sadistic teenage boy (Tom Felton aka. Malfoy). There Caesar learns to sympathize with his fellow ape-mates and realize that the difference between apes and humans is only intelligence. He gains the trust and the leadership of all the apes, and escapes prison.From there the audience is rooting for the apes and not the humans.   Pros: Caesar the Chimp (Andy Serkis), the apes, CGI (done by those who did Avatar) was impressive.  Cons: Unimpressive performances from most human actors including James Franco, and his girl friend who only serves as a distraction.   Furthermore, there comes a point in the film when Caesar has a chance to show he is in fact capable of compassion, even greater than an average human being, yet he refuses to save the man, allowing him to plummet to his death.   Ultimately the film is a fair enough distraction in a summer of films. Andy Serki's performance as a hyper intelligent chimp, his growth, and his life, is enough to gain the heart of the viewer. By the end you'll want to be swinging through the tree tops yelling \\"FReeeeDooomm!!\\"
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I read all kinds of books. I like paranormal books that have more science or history than silliness in them. This book is a good blend of witches, vampires and demons but not in the way that is stereotypical for the genre. If you are looking for a Laurell Hamilton-type story this is not for you.  If you want lots of sexy-time, this book is not for you (and I agree that there is nothing wrong with books with lots of sexy-time).  But, if you want an interesting story about two university professors, one a witch and the other a very experienced vampire, who fall in love and face adversity because their kind don't think they should mix then you will like this book. Lots of historical referencing throughout the story and an interesting take on supernaturals. An enjoyable read.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|amazing game haven't any issues with this game super challenging exactly like it should be on a game like this. saves place so if you have to close it for some reason pick up where you left off. just overall amazing!
B004EPZ07K|4.0|To those of you out there debating whether or not to purchase this movie, let me give you my two cents on it. First of all, I don't see why there's so much dislike for this movie. It might not be the same calibur as, say, Transformers: Dark of the Moon but-for what it is- Green Lantern is a pretty darn good movie. Especially with it being the first movie in the series(if there is one), anyways. While I wouldn't have chosen Ryan Reynolds to play Green Lantern, the rest of the cast fit things perfectly. What I like about the movie is, even though the source material is more fantastical, the movie was played quite seriously with a little humor mixed in and that's what sold it with me.<br /><br />Don't let these haters fool you, it is a good movie.
1584282584|5.0|First some background: I bought my first flash the same day I bought this book since I was perfectly aware that flash photography is a topic far more complex than it might look like to the unexperienced amateur, and indeed an amateur I am so everything has been a discovery in this book. As such, being conscious that this might bias my judgement, the book has been undoubtedly effective in explaining the theory (with a strong push to try it myself then) of on-camera flash lightning.  Mr. van Niekerk approach is to explain the theory, then provide plenty of images in which he shows what the picture would look like with ambient light alone and with one or more of the just explained setup of added flash light, all this with a language as clear as desirable.  However, all this might someway be \\"expected\\", after all these were the hopes when I bought the book. But there's more. For example, I didn't expect that by starting a discussion on the functioning of camera meters, how generally one must cope with the problem of metering white subjects and have them actually rendered as white rather than something grayish. I didn't expect this would be the book that taught me the simple (once met for the first time) yet effective technique of placing the whites close the right edge of the histogram by intentionally overexposing until it happens (while I previously pondered general overexposing only in the perspective to exploit the editing latitude provided by RAW images). It was a trigger to find further readings, to eventually get a gray reference card and move on improving my technique toward accuracy.  If I had to identify something on the improvements side, say, for a second edition of the book, I would suggest to stuff in more illustrations of the scenes overviews showing the photographer and camera, their relative position with respect to the subjects and the area where light is bounced. These kind of illustrations are mostly present in the latest pages of the book, yet I found them tremendously helpful to me so I would surely have appreciated more of them. These might, by exchange, be added at the expense of some repetitions, tough I understand this is just a teaching style that I've found by now present in several technical books.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|The first chapter is captivating, but you'll soon lose these characters for several chapters to be reintroduced to them at a different stage of life.  While not a difficult read, I didn't find it rewarding in any way or captivating of my attention to want to keep reading it.  I found the book to be an excercise in reading since it won an award, but not an enjoyable read.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Because we are always entertaining friends with bar-b-q parties in our backyard, we decide to buy a nice stereo or something like it. We then went out and got a BoseDock to use it with a loptop but, for our surprise, that BoseDock model didn't have an \\"auxiliary/line-in\\" connector. Too bad! So I checked on Ebay and ended up buying for $10 a cable with a vendor in Hong Kong. Oh Boyyy! That cable took 17 days to get to us (in Orlando, FL) and to make things even worse, it didn't work. Mannnnn! I didn't want to take the Dock back to store neither to stuck with that thing as souvenir. Luckly after doing some search on amazon and reading the reviews on Cablejive, I decided to take the chance. Gee....what a quality! The music comes out just as good as when the ipod is connected to the Dock. We were so alleviated!  Thanks CableJive--you guys saved my investment! Now we can relax and enjoy some good music.
B004ZQBP3Q|4.0|Very good cd.  I liked a good portion of the tracks on the cd but the rest I could have done without.  Not bad though but in all honesty things are starting to sound the same.
0743201140|2.0|Although this was a great read the book wasn't at all new. There is a strengths test that goes along with the book and this was the only reason I really ordered the book.  I contacted the seller and they gave me a refund and I got to keep the book but unfortunately I still haven't been able to take my test for it. Bummer guess I shouldn't have bought it from amazon. Sad face......
B005GVA2L0|2.0|Not too impressed.  I was stoked on this coming out and needless to say it sounds like they have lost their drive.  Not the best album released.  Songs seem to have the same beat all the way through and nothing changes.  I really wish it would be different like in open door.  That was a good album.  I would skip over this one and wait for them to get a reality check.
1439177783|3.0|This is a  realistic look at how most women (from my experience) think and feel.  The only difference is, Portia had the willpower to actually pull it off.  I'm not sure this would be a good, \\"self help\\" book.
B005IS565S|2.0|The music is all the same.  No difference in songs.  Kinda disappointed.  Their last album wasn't too bad but this seems all the same.  Not too thrilled.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio is great in this mind bending thriller.  It keeps you guessing right up to the last second. You'll want to own this so you can watch it more than once and I promise you will not get bored of doing so.
B00518HBD0|5.0|I love 3 doors down.  Always keeping it real and their music is a good mix up of different songs.  They still impress me with their ability to come up with good songs that you can put meaning behind and feeling.  I remain happy with all of the music on this cd. Some are a tad bit better than others but very good.
B005LZYL3G|1.0|Wow, so this is just the movie itself and NO extras at all??? There is no point in buying the single disc, no-extra version, and now they are sold out of the deluxe sets. The deluxe sets will probably run $1000 on E-Bay...
B005ILWOZA|4.0|Hadn't heard of this talented singer from overseas, just lucky to be listenting to some tunes here and there and heard his singles \\"I won't let you go\\" and \\"UP\\" and whats left of my hair stood up, wow this guy has an awesome soulful vocal with enough polish to stand out and I started listening to this new collection and its growing on me. Its nice in this day and age to hear a VOCALIST, especially a male who can actually sing and has so much feeling in his voice. I will be keepin an eye and ear to this talented singer and hope he gets back to the states for some more touring,love this new soul music! \\"Slave to the music\\" is also another gem off this.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Awesome game. One of my favorites. The update starts me over though which sucks. Please fix. I had all stars before.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Glad I found this product.  For years, it's been cumbersome for me to buy iphone/ipod adapters and then needing to unplug and remove the ipod (so it doesn't get stolen).  This unit is great because it's very low profile and shuts off when you shut off your car and starts back up exactly where you left the song.  The sound quality is also good in the areas I'm in. My only 2 suggestions to make it better would be:  1.  Make the unit tilt left and right.  Currently it tilts up and down, which is great but having the ability to tilt left and right would make the screen face the driver better and would also help with the screen glare that can make it difficult to read the screen if it is too sunny.  2.  Dedicated folder button.  Right now you have to press 2 buttons to get the folder view.  I think most people, like me, search between many folders and a dedicated button would just make it a bit easier.  Thanks for a great product...
1400079144|1.0|I never write reviews for anything, but I think people should know to avoid this poorly conceived, inconsistent, and plain terrible novel.  Dan Brown has some good books.  This is not one.  Avoid at all costs.  No editor even looked at this work.  They obviously said 'its Dan Brown, who cares what he wrote!'  Among the hundreds of reasons this book reeks are annoying little things such as:  the narrator going out of the way to insist than NO ONE has ever been in a lab, but somehow faith healers were scanned in the lab, presumably healing people?  That seems like more than 3 people...  Anyway...I am SO relieved to have finished this so I don't have to dread getting in my car to hear this rambling insanity any longer.
0446547654|5.0|Another great read from Nicholas Sparks...and another cry.  Truly beautiful, real-life type story.  Highly recommend...can't wait for the next one!
B0050CJNJ2|3.0|this is a \\"pleasant\\" album, I enjoy listening to them, but it is kind of a \\"snooze-fest\\" in that there are just nice songs but nothing outstanding or catchy.  Definitely not as good as the previous CD, but still I would recommend it because they make nice music.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|Jennifer Anniston has the only great scenes in the movie.  And ironically, although I think she is great looking, I've never thought she is good in any movie I've seen her in ... except this movie.  But her scenes are limited.  Don't waste your money or time on this one - even when it comes out on cable for free.
B005KH928E|5.0|La verdad que se la comieron con este disco, excelente m&uacute;sica de Erick Clapton con Wynton Marsalis! La guitarra de Clapton con la trompeta de Marsalis suena espectacular!
B002OMZTSK|3.0|An ok book but a disappointing read. Very teenage in the tone. usually books for teenagers can also be read by adults, but I don't recommend this one for adults.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|Every CD John Hiatt has made is on my shelf. The last few haven't been my favorites, but this one is up to the level of the best. Welcome back, John!
B000QEIOUS|5.0|The movie arrived on time and it was brand new, just as the description said. I am happy with my purchase.
B004LWZW42|5.0|As usual, arrived in a timely fashion and was impeccably packaged.  No damage occurred in shipment.  I was at the time of the order concerned that the film may not be in widescreen format, as it was not specified in the item description.  It was, and I would have returned it if it was not.  It is important to me to have widescreen movies in my collection, in order to capture all of the director's intended imagery, and while I am not disappointed with my purchase in any way, I would have appreciated the format specified in the item description.
1881273873|5.0|I bought this for a friend's birthday and she has nothing but good things to say about it.  I'm not sure how it differs from the original title but she loved it so I'll go with it.  :)
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|saw this in the theater... It has it's funny moments/sad moments... kinda sad to see hp go, but now I'm board with the series since I've read it so many times and finished the movies.... Great while it lasted though :)  Update: this has the ultraviolet digital copy, which is why so many people are giving this movie negative reviews... if you would rather have an itunes copy, contact flixster... They will email you back a code to use so that you can get an itunes copy rather then the stream copy...

B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Awesome sixth season! Hope this series continues on indef! Can't get the US channels yet overseas, so this reminds me of home!
B005CK76ZA|1.0|Could not believe how bad they remastered this, stick to your original if you have it or even the 180 gram reissue one, shame on you for releasing such a terrible work to us fans!! And destroying a great sounding album from a great band to this extreme! Makes no sense!! It is all about the money not the music!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I wasn't expecting a classic in the Town.  That's exactly what it is though.  Yup!  It's about a group of mask-wearing bank robbers that take a young woman hostage after collecting a ton of cash, and after the fearful woman is taken to an ocean and dropped off while blindfolded, a few days later the bank robbers finds where the woman lives (thanks to one of them taking her ID card during the hostage situation) and actually becomes romantically involved with her during an emotional meet up at the downtown laundromat.  It's interesting how the storyline only barely touches upon the actual romance.  The Town is most certainly an action/suspense movie because the man continues to rob banks with his buddies even after the involvement with the woman.   Throughout the film he has to try and find clever ways to hide the fact he was the one responsible for making the woman lifes traumatizing during the bank robbery.  Will she ever find out who he really is?  You'll have to watch it to find out.  Without giving anything away, there's some REALLY close calls (such as when the woman was able to identify a tattoo on the neck of one of the bank robbers, and later this very same man makes a surprise appearance when the woman is out on a date and sitting at an outside restaurant).    The future bank robberies really elevated the overall action factor to a new level of excitement and, for that matter, a new level of gun shooting segments.  These particular gun shooting segments are especially graphic and meaningful given the nature of the storyline and how it focuses on one aggressive group of bank robbers doing everything in their power to escape the FBI and defy the odds.  I was really caught up in the plotline and the solid acting abilities of everyone involved while watching the Town this afternoon, and, if anything else, the Town is perhaps a slightly different take on the somewhat tiresome bank robbery routine that's become boring and predictable over the years.  I thoroughlyrecommend it.
0385344325|4.0|So now I finally know why Jack Reacher is a loner. Out there in the world with a toothbrush, a military pension and some cash to buy new clothes that he wears for a short time. This book explains how the famous Jack Reacher got there and it's a wild ride of a plot.   Jack Reacher is sent to a small town where a woman has been killed in a gruesome manner. Did someone on the local Army base commit the crime? Who is trying to cover up the crime? Reacher has to deal with the Pentagon and its bureaucracy and deal with a good looking sheriff (surprise, surprise, huh?) in the town that Reacher is not sure he can trust at first, but later? Well.....let's just say they trust each other a lot and when that midnight train goes through town? Well, I'll let you read the steamy scenes (and there is more than one midnight train going through town).  The plot is solid for most of the book. Additional people are found dead and previous cases now appear to link with current cases, but can he trust the sheriff who was a Marine herself? What is she hiding? There were moments that I loved this book, but then there were moments that I thought the book went awry (i.e. the local country bums who carried guns and acted like soldiers was a bit silly in my opinion) and the reasons for Reacher finally leaving the military are still not quite clicking with me.   It's a good read. I think it's one of Child's better books, but I can't give it more than 4 stars because of some of the \\"over the top\\" stuff in the book and an ending that left me a bit disappointed.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I got this yesterday and immediately put it in my Blu-ray player. I watched it and was amazed all over again, the picture was absolutely perfect, and they added flickering stars and shooting stars that move which added to the magic of the movie. I will watch this Blu-ray every week.
B005LY3VRO|5.0|Even though the remixes are not new they are catchy and really good.  Really worth it and for real Britney fans!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is without doubt one of the best movies from 2011. From beginning to end it would keep you attached to your seat
0312330537|4.0|I'm by half of this book, recommended to all traveling to India, especially Mumbai.<br />I liked it because it's true and the author seems to have a very good grip and understanding of the culture.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|X-men first class will not let you down. Good effects and good story makes this movies one of the best of 2011. This movie still keep its feeling of giving us a good plot, nice acting and keeps loyal to previous movies on the saga
0385534639|4.0|After having come across no less than three articles in the media about this book, I finally decided I had to read it for myself to see what the fuss was.  The first half of the book didn't suck me in.  This was partly because it was constructed so unusually and the reason why is not apparent until the last page.  I kept reading because it was so different from anything I had read before, but I wasn't quite sure it was good.  This book felt like one of those optical illusion paintings.  It has more than one possibility, and you aren't certain what you are looking at.  Then, in the second half, I could finally see the other image - and it was pure magic. I could not pull myself away from this enchanting tale, this touching love story.  Was this book up to the hype?  Probably not.  But it was a wonderful book none-the-less.<br /><br />Two men are in opposition.  They have engaged in many contests over the years, pitting one school of thought against another, via proxy.  This latest contest sets one man's daughter against the other's chosen champion.  The circus is their playing field; the one left standing is the winner.  But what happens when the opponents fall in love and neither wants to win a game that cannot be quit? Celia and Marco's story should end in tragedy, unless love truly does conquer all.<br /><br />This book had a very satisfying conclusion, but there are still threads that could be pulled. I would read a sequel, but would not be upset if there wasn't one. I will read more by this author.  Overall, I am very glad I read this. I might have missed out on some real magic had I not.
B003JBHQP4|4.0|Well this lector have many options to read. Is good for the price. Maybe, it's a little big but for the price is good
B003L77G6A|5.0|It is so funny to see how our beloved physicists try to through everyday life - facing women, career limitations and other problems. Even Penny now has to deal with jealousy and it is so cute, how she, Bernadette and Amy are trying to be friends. A wonderful season of BBT!
B003L77G2Y|4.0|Series at times gets stranger but it's still the best series on TV. Very character driven, surrounded still with episodes on interest.
0767819659|5.0|This movie is amazing, it is one of my favorite movie since I was a child, and when I saw it was available on Amazon, I was thrilled :D  The one thing I didn't like about it, is all the security tapes, but they are easily removed, but they were 3, and I think 1 would be enough...OTHER than that I'm really happy with it! :D
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|This product has a good built quality and does what it is suppose to very well. I would recommend this to anyone. It is also cheaper than getting it from apple so dont hesistate and buy it :)
014241493X|2.0|John Green is a lovely author, Looking for Alaska left a mark on me but Paper Towns, not so much. I have read both Looking For Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines, and I just could not really get into it at all. I was about half way through the book when I just set it back down. Given I have the habit of reading the last paragraph in a book, and when I did in this one it basically gave the entire story away and that is why I set it down. To be quite honest, the characters and story line are just too similar as to his other books that I have read and in this novel they just weren't as strong as they could have been. Plus, I found the main character somewhat annoying and the girl, Margo very similar to Alaska but just not as intriguing. Still a decent read for a high schooler but I just wasn't too impressed.
0240815807|5.0|This book by Mike Senior is worth its weight in gold...   Have you ever battled with just not getting your mix right, the reverb is just not right and the eq just slightly off... the balance is just not conveying the right image you want... where do you begin to fix these nuisances and what is the best method of doing that.    Mixing secrets sheds much more than some light on the subject matter, it douses it with practical techniques and reasoning that will change the way that you mix.  Whilst there are 100 ways to skin the proverbial cat, this book offers useful and comprehensive suggestions that become intuitive from a mixing point of view... are there better techniques, maybe, are there better work arounds in achieving the best possible mix, maybe... but what Mike Senior has done is collect some of the more acceptable consistent solutions that become part of your mixing arsenal.  Sure, hands on experience is really the only way to improve, but if you get into a mixing rut... this book will give you a different perspective on how to resolve your production issues, improving you own mixing techniques.  If you are a first timer, this book will lead you in the right direction in the least amount of time (provided that you understand some of the basics of mixing).  If you are a seasoned console operator, you will definitely incorporate some new insight into how best to do things. Reducing the time required in mixing from the start, and as always, time is money.  Not only does this book cover mixing techniques, it also covers some considerations on the types of equipment to chose and why.  No, this is not a bible on all things mixing, but it sure comes close.  Especially as the title suggests... \\"Mixing secrets for small studio's\\".  Lets face it, that's where most of us start.  Sometimes revisiting these basic concepts without hugely expensive equipment sets us on the path to sonic purity.   Highly recommended.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|Okay first of all let me say that I've known about Daft Punk for at least 15 years now and honestly, I thought that they completely sold out and were washed up.  I first stumbled upon this set one day while on youtube.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing (and the visuals for the show are equally impressive)!!!  This set is by far one of the most legendary sets I have ever heard!  If they ever hit up the Boston area, I must see them.  I just saw Deadmau5 and even he doesn't match up with these guys during a live set.
0062011847|4.0|Commander Sam Vimes is forced on holiday by his wife & boss, but finds that crime doesn't ever take a day off.  In the countryside, murder has happened and a population is being forced into slavery.  Vimes takes on the situation with his unique coppering skills.  As a fan of Discworld and especially the City Watch novels, I found myself glad to be back in Vimes' head.  Good supporting characters, (some new, some familiar) and while there is not a ton of overt humor, there is still plenty of humor (and satire) to enjoy.  Also, the goblins have great names!
B004EPZ08E|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I was especially surprised at Jennifer Aniston, who up until this movie, I enjoyed watching and trusted. She must be desperate for work to have agreed to play this part, like Sandra Bullock in \\"All About Steve\\".  The script was nothing but filth. Whoever wrote it must be a pervert.  The only thing funny about it was Colin Ferrell's disguise. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's a worthless waste of time.

B004HO6I2E|5.0|Bateman and Reynolds are 2 of my favorite actors. Story is about 2 men who wish they had the other one's life, thinking the grass is always greener on the other side - some thought of regret for what they haven't experienced in life and thinking it was too late now. By supernatural means they get to live each other's life for a time which leads to some pretty comical scenes while they come to realize what they truly want their lives to be like. I laughed, I cried. Worth watching.
0061122416|5.0|Honestly sometimes a review don't do justice to a book. This all i have to say....GET THE BOOK/BORROW THE BOOK/STEAL THE BOOK whatever... this is a must read for anyone

0810994739|5.0|Have you ever had a secret so embarrassing to tell that you would do anything just to keep it locked up from everyone else? This secret is not your secret. It is Greg Heffley's. The plot of Dairy of a Wimpy Kid, Rodrick Rules is set around the big secret. That's what keeps the book so much more than an exciting read. Are you wondering what the mystery in this book is yet?  Read this book and Greg Heffley will tell you exactly what his untold truth is. Last summer Greg did something so terrible it's hard to describe. In this book, you will find how Jeff Kinney puts the mystery into words. Is Greg so scared about his big secret that he does not even tell Rowley, his best friend? Will Rodrick, Greg's \\"trustworthy\\" brother tell you the secret? Well now do you want to know what the big secret is yet? Read the book to find out!!!!   Michael - age 11
B004EPZ084|5.0|OMG! This movie was crazy funny. Loved it. Laughed til I cried. Charlie Day was brilliant hilarious! You won't be disappointed.
B005LJITS0|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie - Love Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively - it was good to see her do something other than gossip girl.  Of course it is always a pleasure to watch Ryan Reynolds.  Loved the special effects!!
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Saw this in 3D at the theater. Cinematography was awesome. Ryan Reynolds was great, showed he's a great actor who can do more than just comedy. Story line about 2 worlds working together to defeat another world bent on destruction. A feel good movie, good for whole family, has good values. I recommend it.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|If you were to tell me Lex, Lionel, and Lana all left and the season was actually really good; I would've slapped you. But really other than a poor season finale the season had a continuous series of really good episodes and overall good plot. I LOVE SMALLVILLE!!

B005D0RDKW|5.0|You have to have a great memory to remember how important Cleveland was to rock music.  As I recall, on Rush's first album they thanked Kid Leo on the sleeve?  Working Man was only outplayed by Stairway, and at midnight on Saturday (?, or was it Friday) the unedited, 25 min version of Maggot Brain.  You would have thought WMMS was on the payroll.  They weren't, they just knew good freaking music!!  Missed the Moving Pictures tour...but caught Signals and have been hooked ever since.  I moved out of Cleveburg, 7 years ago, and would have given just about anything to see Rush ONCE more, in the town that truly loved them FIRST!!

1878424505|5.0|This book tells me that life is all about love. You are the most wonderful person you know. Your life is all about you, as life \\"is\\" about the self. And this does not mean that you are being selfish.  You arrive on this earth alone and you will leave this earth alone.  So enjoy your experience.<br />The book makes it very clear that if you learn to love yourself, you will learn to love all of the other people in this life and world around you.<br />You cannot share with others what you do not possess yourself; to love others you must first learn to love yourself.<br /><br />This book is about love, compassion, and fulfilment, which has been the philosophy of human beings since the beginning of time. It is a simplification of the best way to live life without the baggage of an organisation giving you a manual and instructions to follow. (Words only represent 7% of communication amongst humans). I try to live my life using these four agreements and every day I grow in love as I discover new beauty in this world and in the people who live in it.<br />The most wonderful part or the book is its simplicity. It is a lot more fulfilling to live and experience life than it is to waste you life trying to figure out what it's all about.<br />I wish you and the world love, happiness and fulfilment on this journey of life.<br />Johnny K Snr.<br />Dublin<br />Ireland

B004EPZ07U|1.0|The only reason I purchased the combo pack was so I could place a digital copy of the movie on my iPad so I could watch it when I travel.  Had I been informed that I would have to sign up for a Flixster account, and a UltraViolet account, and then still not be able to watch it on my iPad without an internet connection, I would've purchased the Blu-Ray edition for far less money.  If you're looking to have a digital copy for your mobile device that you can watch without requiring an internet connection, save yourself some money and buy the movie-only edition.
0061784788|5.0|It is so far an amazing book. A hard cover book for a great price. It's a must own book.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The art of racing in the rain is a great book. no not great fantastic! Its told by Enzo a dog with a lot of strong views on the world and how it works. his owner Denny loves him dearly. I am a dog lover and maybe that helped me like this book but im not sure. Mr. Stein did an amazing job writing this. Sometimes I forgot that Enzo is a dog. but then he will make a comen on how he so wants to be human. And another thing Enzo or Zo as Denny will sometimes call him watchs t.v. He loves it. He talks about how he saw a show about Monglia and how they think animals will come back as humans. Enzo will be a man. The ending is sad. Hopefully there will be a second book. This one was amazing!!!!!

0385344325|3.0|I've read all of the Reacher series except #12 because of the average ratings it got. I found The Affair not up to standards. The story line was just too incredible to me. Was it four or five wrecks by the same midnight train in the same town without the railroad police showing up? Also I somewhat enjoyed Reacher's self-licensed right to kill instincts in the other books, but in The Affair I felt his actions were over the top. I also felt the reason given for his pending involuntary discharge was trumped up and underdeveloped by the author. What can I say, I was disappointed. I will likely buy again but may wait for a lower price and a lot of other reviews before I do. Sorry.

B005BZQS1E|1.0|This is the worst movie in the history of bad movies. Don't waste your time and money for it. What a surprise I received when I saw the great cast, but very poor script. The jokes are vulgar, and the plot is mediocre and boring.

B005LJK3AC|1.0|HORRIBLE BOSSES is.  Why there is a continuing need to put films of this sort before the market is cause for concern. The story is ludicrous - maybe playing out the fantasies most people control about disliking their 'bosses' is OK but actually showing it is another item altogether. Potty mouth dialogue, sociopathic behavior supposedly masked by three guys who 'really aren't all that bad', and placing the roles of Bosses who are over the top obnoxious and maladaptive in the hands of actors of the caliber of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston, and Colin Farrell is a gross waste of talent.  Then padding the 'story' with appearances (albeit brief) by Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, Jamie Foxx and especially Ioan Gruffudd - there must be some favors owed somewhere.<br /><br />It is a committee written script (Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein) and it shows: this is more a disconnected series of standup comedian jokes than a story.  Seth Gordon directs with a heavy hand on exasperatingly gross language and sexual innuendoes, insulting just about everybody possible.  The only saving grace about this 'film' is the comedic timing by Jason Bateman and his cohorts in crime - Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis.  There are some funny lines but the sorry mess you have to wade through to get to them is hardly worth the effort. It is an embarrassingly poor film, but  as with the popularity of The Hangover et al it sells tickets.  Sad.  Grady Harp, October 11
B004EPYZTE|5.0|I've never been a Conan fan, but I figured I'd give it a try since Jason Momoa would be playing the title character, and WOW! did he ever deliver! This movie had all the action I had hoped for plus quite a bit of \\"magic\\" and TONS of barbarian passion. There was a lot more humor than I expected, just the right amount of gore and nudity (how can it not, being a barbarian movie) and left me with a very clear picture of what life as a barbarian might be like. This Conan was AMAZING and I cannot wait until I can have the DVD (or bluray) in my collection.
B0055V6EZE|3.0|Sorry -- I love blues, and the songs and overall musicianship are top notch, but Laurie's voice is hard to listen to for even a single song.
B0017HMF6W|4.0|A little bit of railroad history was cut from the movie in the BluRay release. I do not know why such a brief scene was deleted except the editor of the BluRay thought something was amiss and jarring. The New York Central 20th Century Limited had an agreement with the Santa Fe Super Chief to attach a Pullman first class sleeper car from the arriving Super Chief in Chicago and take it in to New York City. Thus the passengers on the Super Chief did not need to transfer with their luggage from Dearborn Station to LaSalle Street Station. The whole car was switched over to the 20th Century. The reverse was true for Super Chief through passengers from NYC to L.A. In the the newly released BluRay version a brief scene which showed the silver Santa Fe car in the middle of the NY Central 20th Century Limited gray consist exiting a tunnel in New York City heading north was deleted. A bit of the original was therefore cut.
B0053FP1PQ|5.0|I tried not to read any other reviews before writing this, but a few of the negatives jumped out from the previous ones.  \\"Generic\\" a bit \\"disappointed\\" just hit me, and I have to say that I felt that way myself at first.  It took about five listens to really get into Junk of the Heart and dig the coolness within.  Rosie, Eskimo Kiss, Runaway,  Petulia, these are very cool songs; and all the songs are really catchy.  I love the Beatles references like the birds on Petulia, strings on (the all too-short) Time Above the Earth, and harmony vocals on Mr. Nice Guy. There's Stones and other stuff here and there, too, but never obnoxiously.  Luke's voice is great as ever, so is Hugh's savvy guitar playing--and tasteful string arranging on this one.  For me, Inside In/Inside Out was a more exciting album, and it did hold more youthful promise of a 1960s British style re-invasion.  Perhaps the invasion window for this band has past, but Luke's is the kind of solid songwriting and performance that perseveres.  As with catchy pop rock wizards like Weezer's Rivers Cuomo, I expect some of us will continue to be enchanted with his formidable musical talent, attitude, and quirky accent for years to come.
1400049628|4.0|This book was great but I am terrified of my shower now. A very good book, a very good book.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|This movie is a little frustrating at times. The things they get right, are fantastic. The other parts really drag the movie down. Mostly what brings it down is the relationship between Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris. Any momentum the movie has drops dead when their scenes start. I don't mind a love story in my superhero movies, but it just wasn't done interestingly enough here.  Also...the after credits scene is so stupid. They took a major plot point of the Green Lantern story and turn into a 15 second after thought. Oy!
B005ELZKWS|1.0|The first CD was a big surprise, it was awesome and catchy and footstompin! It really had a flavor to it, all the songs packed a helluva punch with terrific hooks, great beats, and awesome guitar work from Joe Satriani.  It's just a fun hard rock album all the way! The new CD is hard, dreary, flat, generic, boring, terrible ballads, poorly written music and bad production! There isnt much catch about any of these songs, I mean nothing!  It just seems it getting so much harder for bands to write great music and produce great albums!  It's mostly miss even for classic bands!  There isnt really a single song I like on this entire album, it's no stars for me!  As much fun as the guys were having, they should of taken their time, and come back to the studio another time instead of writing all the songs, recording, and releasing this right away!  They weren't ready for another album yet.  This is a throwaway and it will fall off the chart after a few weeks!  It's like a very bad 80's hard rock album.  There were plenty of them, Sammy made a few bad solo albums like this.  This is a dud, sorry!
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I pre-ordered this blu-ray 6 weeks ago, it arrived 4 days after it was available everywhere else. When we popped it in the blu-ray player - the sound is distorted...AND because this blu-ray is now no longer in an \\"unopened condition\\", no refund. Hmph. No more pre-ordering for me. What a con. What if everyone's product was rubbish? What's a customer to do?
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Been a fan since I picked up the original Armed and Dangerous EP in a record store in the mid 80s. While Anthrax has been fairly consistent in their quality, there have been some ups and downs. Forget all that.<br /><br />This is a band now hitting its pinnacle--or at least taking a huge leap towards it--20+ years into their career. Great music, great lyrics, great production, and great attitude. Joey Bellandonna is back and deserves some serious kudos for this performance.<br /><br />Was listening to this album while running this morning. Was planning to switch to the new Opeth (which I also love...) about halfway into run. However couldn't bring myself to switch...tune after tune after tune had me addicted.<br /><br />If you love heavy, yet tuneful, metal with serious attitude, buy this.
B0001E7LMU|5.0|Honestly I didn't pay any attention to the fact that this is the German version of the game.  I don't speak German.  Oops, bummer.  No wonder it took so long to arrive.  HA!  My bad.  So, I opened it anyway and the game cards don't have any words printed on them (other than \\"Saboteur\\").  No problem.  I was able to download the instruction in English and printed them out and put them right into the game box.  So to recap: The box and instructions are in German.  The game cards have no print on them.  I kept the German instructions for image reference.<br /><br />You can download the Saboteur English instruction from the manufacture website, just follow this link:<br /><br />[...]
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I would give this a 5* rating but I can't condone it's cheating.  It forces the standard rule of cannot play a Draw 4 Wild card if you have a playable card otherwise BUT will routinely lay a Draw 4 Wild and play the same color that is already in play. Otherwise the game is enjoyable enough in quick play settings.

0525422943|4.0|Three years ago, Mia had a choice. Stay or go. Live or die. Him or them.<br /><br />She chose to stay. But she didn't choose him.<br /><br />Three years ago Adam lost the girl he loved. It was a gradual losing, the petering out of a song, the gradual hush of harmony . . .  until the day came that Mia got on a plane to NYC and Julliard, and never looked back. Never came back. Cut all ties.<br /><br />Three years later and Adam is lead singer and songwriter for Shooting Star. He is labelled as the new Kurt Cobain, and his romance with Bryn is tabloid fodder and on high-alert baby-bump watch. Adam is about to start a 63-day European tour. And he couldn't be more terrified or miserable.<br /><br />It has been three years since they last saw each other . . .  but a poster beckons and Adam finds himself at Carnegie Hall, listening to Mia play in her first major concert. Tomorrow she leaves for Japan. In a few hours he boards a plane to London. They have one night to make up for three lost years - a night to explore New York, and learn each other all over again.<br /><br />`Where She Went' is the sequel to Gayle Forman's heartbreaking success, `If I Stay'.<br /><br />I went into this book weary. My heart still felt bruised and battered from `If I Stay'. . .  reading the sequel's blurb and knowing that Adam and Mia's clear love from that first book didn't end happily-ever-after was another kick-in-the-guts. I didn't know if I could take reading this sequel, and being heaped with more sadness. But I, like many fans must have, found myself wanting to know what happened next . . . does love prevail? Is there a silver lining? Did Mia regret her decision? I will say that at the end of `Where She Went' I wasn't 100% convinced that Forman needed a sequel . . . but I was glad I read it.<br /><br />As the title hints, `Where She Went' is not told from Mia's point of view. `If I Stay' was all in Mia's first-person narrative. As suggests the new third-person title `Where She Went' is not Mia's story, but Adam's. The sequel is told this time from his first-person narration, and it's not always a pretty perspective.<br /><br />Adam got what he always wanted - fame. Rock stardom. The cover of Rolling Stone and Shuffle magazine. He got the groupies and now the famous girlfriend. But clich&eacute;s are clich&eacute;s for a reason, and fame is not all it's cracked up to be. Adam is scared of crowded spaces after a mob incident. He is ostracized from his band mates for his rising star and tabloid popularity. And he has taken to popping pills to stop his hands from shaking. Adam knows where it all went wrong, and who he owes his fame to. Without Mia and the heartbreak she inflicted, Adam would have never written the album `Collateral Damage' that catapulted Shooting Star into rock stardom. But to get there and write those lyrics, Adam had to have his heart ripped out by the only girl he ever loved. . .<br /><br />Adam is pondering and panicking the band's upcoming European tour when he decides, on a whim, to hear Mia play Carnegie Hall. A chance meeting has the two old flames reuniting for one night - a night to explore New York and remember each other. A night, perhaps, to right the wrongs of the past.<br /><br />In `Where She Went', Forman tries to adhere to the narrative structure of `If I Stay', with varying results. In the first book Mia's narrative flipped between watching her present-time battered body in a hospital room, and remembering moments of great import from her past. In the sequel, Adam is wandering around the Big Apple with Mia in present day, while also remembering his crash course of stardom and his crash and burn love with Mia after her accident. I thought the present-day Mia and Adam storyline was sublime. Pitch-perfect between heartbreak and redemption, hope and hurt. But the flashbacks didn't work so much for me this time . . .  they were crucial to `If I Stay' - both for readers to understand the severity of Mia's loss (and how hard it would be for her to stay) but also for her to realize all the reasons she has to hold on, and who she has to hold on to. By contrast, Adam's flashbacks in `Went' are squirm-inducing as he remembers countless one-night-stands with groupies and his first meeting Bryn at the MTV awards.<br /><br />These flashbacks, while important to understanding Adam's stardom, were just plain uncomfortable. Mostly because of Mia and Adam's epic love story, set up beautifully in `If I Stay'. It's hard to read Adam's recounts and how much they sully what was so pure and perfect in the first novel - so that, as a reader, you feel somewhat betrayed to read of Adam's heartless hook-ups with girls he can't remember the names of. And especially his tabloid-followed relationship with movie star Bryn. It's spine-shiveringly awkward to read these, and I was just happy that Forman balanced the awkward with Mia and Adam's present-time romance.<br /><br />In present-time we read how Mia has rebuilt her life in the wake of tragedy. It ignites readers with a certain chest-swelling pride to read how much Mia has progressed and overcome. We fell in love and heartache with her in `If I Stay' - so it's like proud parents that we read of her achievements in spite of heartache. And it's with equally loving affection that we read Mia and Adam patch their past and heal old wounds . . .<br /><br />I will say that I would have liked more focus on the setting of New York in this sequel. I think the city could have been a character unto itself in this book, but it felt a bit like a photo-shoot backdrop. Nothing especially unique or igniting about it. But, honestly, Mia and Adam's rekindled romance kind of steals the show.<br /><br />I'll put a worry to rest for a few of you, and say that `Where She Went' is romantic (*hint, hint, nudge, nudge*). I went into this with a wincing heart - concerned that I'd come out with more bruises inflicted by Forman. Fear not. This is a story of reconnection and forgiveness. It's about the myriad of grief and how we deal, and don't cope, with its ramifications. It's the story of Mia and Adam, who had to go there to come back to each other.<br /><br />There is a part of me that thinks `If I Stay' should have been left untouched. It was literary perfection and didn't need a sequel. I think of that old writing idiom, that says `leave the reader cold' - leave them with a little bit of wanting, a smidge of read between the lines and make up your own mind. `Where She Went' doesn't do that - the sequel ties up loose ends and puts a definitive ending on Mia's story . . .  and I don't necessarily think we needed that. That's not to say I didn't thoroughly enjoy `Where She Went' (or appreciate Forman's closure to Adam and Mia's story). But there's also a (fairly large) part of me that thinks `If I Stay' was all the more powerful for being left on the precipice.has to hold on to.

0385533829|4.0|Before I go on a trip, I like to read a book or two that takes place in the area I am visiting.  It helps me get to know the city, country or place from a literate point of view.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol takes place in Washington D.C. and I am fortunate to be visiting there soon.  The Lost Symbol is literally a tour of the D.C. area and it includes the symbolic history of the monuments complete with connections to the ancient world.  This book has introduced me to places I now want to visit and awakened my excitement for traveling.  Places like The Library of Congress, The National Cathedral (Darth Vader gargoyle), National Archives, Alexandria, Virginia and so much more.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is the 3rd book in the Robert Langdon series.  The first two are Angels and Demons, and The Da Vinci Code.  This book continues the saga of Langdon, with murder, mystery, misconceptions, and the race to save the world from an unknown fate.  It includes ancient languages, history, religion with particular focus on the founding fathers and Masonry.  Brown never fails to surprise me with his plot twists and turns.  Just when I think I figure the mystery out, something unexpected happens.  Love him or hate him, a book by Dan Brown is an entertaining read especially if Robert Langdon is the main character.<br /><br />I read the special illustrated edition of The Lost Symbol and it is beautifully done with real photos that enhance the learning and understanding of the reader.  I wish more books were illustrated, so readers could see the connection to the real world the novel contains.  Brown is an excellent teacher of  hidden history and this book is a gem waiting to be discovered by those who love adventures in reading.
1423140591|4.0|After reading all the Percy Jackson books and The Kane Chronicles, you kind of already know what to expect of Riordan, which isnt a bad thing, hes a great story teller, and i love his books. I know for some people the formula of \\"travel all over across America + beat the bad guy\\" lost its charm with the Percy Jackson series, for some people its still working, for me apparently the charm ended with this one, im hoping Riordan throws in something new on the next book, cause i cant help but feel the story is getting stale.<br /><br />All in all its a great book, just as good as the previous one, and the cliffhanger did its job and left me craving for more, im just hoping Riordan does something to make the story feel fresh again.

I have read many articles about his life, watched his interviews, but i have not really known him, apart from having 2 personas of stark contrast from one another -- while on court and while he is in an interview. This book explained a lot and i am very thankful to Rafa for sharing his story to the world. He continues to inspire me, though i know he is winning now as much as before, he is still and forever my number one.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|This region-free blu-ray is easily the best print of this wonderful film I've ever seen. Of the two DVDs packaged with the Blu-ray, only one is region free (a lengthy doc about Welles vs Hearst) but it's a great, thorough, revealing look at the film's turbulent history. Hugely recommended.

A writer friend showed me the YouTube video from the Broadway play and then I saw that Steven Spielberg was directing a movie about the story to release Christmas Day 2011. I tracked down this book which was published in 1982 and in a page or two, I understood the reason for this word of mouth excitement.<br /><br />Michael Morpurgo has written a riveting story told through the eyes of Joey, a war horse. This page turner book grips your heart from the opening and carries through to the last page. I highly recommend you read it and enjoy it as much as I did.
0385344325|5.0|I've read `em all - sixteen of them so far. Only once did Lee Child swerve off the beaten path and allow his personal politics to enter the story. Apparently the sour reaction of many of his fans help point Child back in the right direction.<br /><br /> \\"The Affair\\" takes us back to 1997 and the beginning of the Reacher story we've become familiar with in fifteen prior novels.<br /><br /> Reacher is sent from his unit's Washington DC area headquarters to Carter Crossing, Mississippi, a hamlet really, in a sparsely populated rural county.<br /><br /> A woman has been brutally murdered and senior US Army command is concerned that the murderer might be a soldier at Fort Kelham located close to Carter Crossing. Reacher is a Major in an elite investigative unit. Fans know that Reacher is a most unusual being, a man with a strong sense of justice, quite happy to be investigator, judge, jury and executioner.<br /><br /> This time Reacher is serving two Army masters, his unit commander, Colonal Garber, and a colonel, Frazer who is also the Army's Senate Liason.<br /><br /> The Army is very concerned because there are secret goings on at Fort Kelham - and one of the units is commanded by the son of the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee.<br /><br /> This is the best Jack Reacher novel Lee Child has so far conceived. Yes, it borders on the implausible, but essentially Child never crosses the line into implausibility. There are plenty of plot twists. And there is a much heavier emphasis on sex than normally found in a Reacher novel - but Child makes it work. There are a few technical mistakes as well, but they are easily overlooked.<br /><br /> In short, \\"The Affair\\" is a page turner.<br /><br /> I don't like to give away any significant story or plot items because I feel that robs other readers of the excitement and pleasure of discovering them for themselves.<br /><br /> But this time, I dearly wish there was a discussion forum for people who had read the novel and wanted to compare notes.<br /><br /> This evening, I just decided to forget about everything else, all the things that needed doing, and focus on finishing \\"The Affair\\". Three and a half pleasurable hours as Reachers mind absorbed, reasoned in an almost atavistic way and then acted on his conclusions, sometimes proving correct, sometimes not. If you've read Reacher before, you know he can be spontaneously brutal and violent - and he is here.<br /><br /> There's a romantic involvement here - if you can describe Reacher's involvement with any woman romantic - and it involves a woman Reacher must both work with and distrust simultaneously.<br /><br /> This is, in all, quite a ride. Some Reacher fans, myself included, will find parts of the novel predictable, but Lee Child has built in so many twists, the familiarity is almost comforting. Some of the plot twists rub up hard against believability, but they're so exciting, the reader simply doesn't care.<br /><br /> As you can tell, I think \\"The Affair\\" is terrific. It fills in the Reacher story and stands easily as a thoroughly engrossing thriller, police procedural and adventure novel. Great stuff.<br /><br />Jerryall the things that needed doing, and focus on finishing \\"The Affair\\".

B005LJJESY|5.0|This movie was compelling, inspiring, and dramatic. It shows what the pinnacle of cinematic genius is possible of creating. This was one of THE best films i have seen in over 10 long years. It is definitely worthy of multiple viewings. All of the actors played their parts brilliantly and you actually felt the emotion and power of the film and the green lanterns. This movie is a prime example of why super-hero comics were and still are so popular, and why super-hero films are bringing our beloved comic heroes to life in an altruistic light for the world to enjoy. I totally rate this movie a 5 out of 5. It has earned it for the compelling story and the action packed and realistic battles that all of us fight, even within ourselves. I am definitely going to enjoy this movie multiple times and spread the word to friends and family, so they too can enjoy a movie that is truly AWESOME!
B0000D96NW|5.0|After originally listening to The Burning Red, i knew this album was going to be sweet. After all, Imperium was the main single and that had glorious composition with powerful, self fulfillment based lyrics. The raw power after the extended introduction solidified the idea of purchase.  Since I have heard this cd at least 10 times the past month, I think a track by track review is most suited here; First though, a general description.  The songs all have highly personal and inspirational lyrics, and the guitar wizardry just makes it flow so gorgeously. This album also has the bass mixed into the foreground along with the guitar, making it awesome to play along to. The vocals are very cool as well, whether Flynn is singing, speaking, growling, or yelling. The drumwork on this album is also spectacular in its ferocity.  Imperium: While the song starts softly, once the bass kicks jump in, you know the album is gonna be sweet. The chorus that ends the song is powerful and was probably fit for opening shows on the tours to promote this album.  Bite the Bullet: One of the more straightforward tracks on the album, the stop-start verse makes it noteworthy.  Left Unfinished: Very interesting guitar scrapes and effects on the intro; throughout the album the intros are interesting, but this is my favorite, especially when the bass comes in right when the vocals do.  Elegy: One of the less standout tracks, it is a fantastic song nonetheless. For those interested in buying the album, it's a good representation of all the styles used.  In the Presence of My Enemies: Glorious song composition; you can't help but chant \\"ON YOUR GRAVE! I WILL STAND!\\" with Robb Flynn when he starts.  Days Turn Blue to Grey: Excellent lyrics about growing up in a household full of addictions without convictions. I like the guitar switch ups to this one quite a bit.  Vim: Another straightforward track that represents the album well.  Seasons Wither: Another song with excellent composition; the guitarwork really stands out here.  All Falls Down: My old favorite, the constant switching between the bass emphasis and the guitars is fantastic.  Wipe the Tears: Definitely my favorite song off of the album; the lyrics are powerful and the bass kicks practically lead the song.  Descend the Shades of Night: Quite possibly the greatest outro I have heard for an album. This song has great lyrics and a lot of pitch shifts.  This album sparked a love of Machine Head for me; getting Unto the Locust and hopefully it will be even better.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I bought this dvd for my kids.  It is a classic!  It is a movie my 1, 3 and 14 year old watch together and we enjoy it as a family.  They each have a favorite character and favorite part.  I highly recommend The Lion King.
B004ZNARH4|2.0|I was super excited to purchase this box set for my husband's 50th birthday gift. I was even more excited at the prospect of watching the videos at the party we had for a small group of friends. Very disappointed to find out there are actually only three live songs on the DVD (the Live in Brighton 1972 tracks). I was somehow under the impression that \\"concert screen films\\" meant live concert performances. Turns out they are just films which go along with the songs on the CD. Apparently these were the films played during the live shows? I don't really know, but the whole time the DVD was playing everyone just kept asking \\"when does the concert start?\\". Pretty frustrating sitting there, forwarding from track to track, and finally realizing there was no live performance of the Dark Side of the Moon shows at all, just the animated video playing along with audio. A waste of $100.00 bucks really. I already have the remastered 2003 version of the CD, and the extra trinkets are certainly not worth that much dough. I don't even have a bluray player yet, so that disc is totally worthless to me. I guess we'll probably listen to the quadrophonic version once or twice on the surround sound, but I was REALLY looking forward to live concert footage which IS NOT HERE (except for those three tracks). Haven't listened to the rest of the audio yet, but that was not really why I purchased this set. The \\"video\\" portion was the real draw for me, but unfortunately, the videos are pretty much non-existant.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|The book was hard to get into, is very meatty/complicated.  I find this is the difference between the free/$.99 books + the best selling authors- a multilayered longer book.  I was happy with the ending.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game with just amazing graphics. the beginning levels are very practical as they instruct you in the nuances of the delightful gameplay
B0055EDCGU|2.0|The instrument to this album were as crisp and technical as Shogun. While it seemed like the production was a bit too much on the vocals (anyone that likes Adam D probably knows Times of Grace has the same thing goin' on), the overall sound was very nice and dense.  I wanted to like this album.  However, the lyrics just feel thrown together, especially with the way the song's name is always used in the chorus (In Waves is the perfect song to exemplify.) Often it seems that Heafy just got one metaphor and extended it throughout the song in one phrase trying to climax everything.   The vocals, too, just seem subdued. I'm all for melodic singing over heavy music (alternative metal does it a lot) but in this case it just brings out the poor lyrics work. I would want more of an Ascendancy style with the vocals; the growls seemed almost absent from the album.  That being said, however, Trivium's new drummer definitely filled in for Travis very nicely; hopefully the next album will turn out better.
B001E45XT4|3.0|I've had this headphone for a little over two years now, and I thought that since there are few reviewers who have used this for as long as I had, I should leave my own. I should also warn that the grade I set is based on the quality alone, and I think that given the price this headphone usually sells for it is a good value, but you should decide that.  Pros:  -Decent sound quality  -Comfortable enough for long hours at the computer  -Volume and mic control in the cord  Cons:  -The ears can get a little too warm after a while  -Plastic arch not strong enough  -Volume control failed after some time  I'm a gamer and no sound expert, and although I can notice if the quality of a headphone is bad enough to hurt my ears, I usually don't care for this as long as it's decent enough that doesn't make me check the label to see where it was produced. Since I assume that audiophiles won't be looking for headphones at this price range anyway, my opinion about the sound quality will probably be the same as yours.  I used to play EVE online, which meant sitting for many hours at the computer chatting with friends. This headphone was almost ideal for that while also providing a nice immersion when the time was right. I say \\"almost\\", because it would tend to feel a little uncomfortable after a while with the warmth on my ears.  But in my opinion, the big CON for this headphone is its durability. It does look sturdy and there are certainly crappier headphones out there, but I bought this one thinking that it'd be a mid-range headphone that would last through the years. I was wrong. The plastic arch isn't strong enough if you don't put them on and off carefully, and after a year it started breaking to the point that I now have a piece of duct taping holding it together. The inline volume control is very nice to have, but after a while it started failing so now I have to tweak the volume carefully so that the left side would work again; a real pain.  To wrap up, if you're careful withyour stuff, are not looking to spend too much, and want some decent but not amazing sound quality you might as well get this one. But if you really want quality go look elsewhere.
B000002WE9|5.0|This is one of our favorite CD's.  My favorite, and I don't believe it is on other CD's is \\"Why Me Lord\\" which features J.D. Summers of the Stamps Quartet.  If you love Elvis, you will love this CD!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|ok i thought this was gonna be a hard plastic case, but its actually a rubber skin type. normally i hate those kinds of cases but this one is nice. its not sticky, its slick and slides nicely in and out of your pocket. i recommend this for anyone who is needing a case and a good one for a small price
B005VMVUAQ|3.0|The first half of the movie runs tight and suspenseful.  But the trick with these kinds of movies is that once the hostages escape, the movie is pretty much over. This leads to some pretty lame developments which I won't reveal. But here's a hint:  You know those horror movies where the victim escapes the attacker and runs upstairs instead of downstairs?  It's kind of like that.  It's like an episode of The World's Dumbest Criminals or The World's Dumbest Hostages.  The ending somehow doesn't feel satisfying, because everything that comes before it just gets lamer and lamer.  It is well-filmed and directed, though.  I give three stars for Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, and the daughter who looks like a young Sasha Grey.  And I will continue to support these first releases on streaming video, mainly because I'm too lazy to get dressed and drive to a sticky movie theater with people chomping on popcorn and slurping up soft drinks out of livestock buckets.
0345529057|4.0|Pros - an engaging story with well developed characters in a world of realistic moral ambiguities and surprises.  Cons - too much puffery when it comes to describing feasts and meetings with descriptions of every conceivable type of dish and characters in attendance who may or may not appear to have much to do with the storyline. Sometimes characters develop aspects that are sudden and at extreme divergence from their former selves - take Catelyn Stark for example.  But Martin joins my list of authors whose series of books end with my regret that there's an end to the story.
B0019FWIEQ|1.0|Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and I can't recall another movie of his that I didn't like. This movie reminds me of a 3:10 to Yuma set in the woods... with horrible directing and/or acting.   My main beef is with how Cusack's character treats Freeman. Let say you have a dangerous felon on your hands, you are armed, and your kid is with you, how many times are you going to get less than an arms length away on your own accord? If you can ignore Cusack's character being unintentionally stupid I think this could be worth a little entertainment value. Freeman is fine, but like I said, my attention was drawn to the blatant disregard for common sense. Take it for what it was worth, you might actually enjoy the movie.
006123205X|5.0|Awesome Audio CD!  I had read the book before, but the content of this is hard to grasp, so its important to either re-read the material or simply listen to it over and over again.  Listening to this on my way into work in the morning makes the time go by quicker in traffic, while doing something productful.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The DVD is exactly what I expected.  The condition of the product was New.  The delivery was expediant.  The story is down to earth and I liked the simple humor.  I also enjoyed the musical score so much I ordered the CD sound track from Amozon as well.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|By far and away the best series ever broadcast on tv. Best acted ,best directed , best produced, best written. If you haven't watched this series then you need to.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read most of the book between L.A. and Shanghai while traveling to Chongqing where the book begins. It is well written and and engaging story. I loved it!
1423136802|5.0|If I had known I was going to like all of the books, I would have purchased this set.  I learned a lot about Greek Mythology in a more comical way through Rick Riordan's eyes, than I did in Literature or English classes in Middle School and High School. And I graduated high school in 94.  They definitely make education more appealing to children these days.
1439192812|2.0|Richard Dawkins has a gift for explaining basic science ideas. It's a shame he inject his religion too much. High school and Liberal Arts students can read between the rants and learn a lot about our universe, but nothing about why we exist.  This fits on the shelf right next to Steven Colbert's I Am America and John Stewart's Earth and America. All present an entertaining, bias and political point of view. These books should not be read by children without adult supervision. Be sure the adult is mature enough.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|The digital copy would not work on either my iphone/ipad and I could care less about this flixster thing. The movie industry needs to wake up and offer DRM free copies for mobile use and stop inconveniencing honest customers. The pirates have these ripped and playable for any devices within days and we end up with digital copy protection that makes the video useless for copying to our portable devices.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Everytime you update, it will erase all your data. don't waste your time, because you'll start from scratch everytime you update.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This is a superlative series, with ingenious plotting, writing that creates both bitingly funny lines and totally chilling situations and the most genuinely evil political couple ever to appear on screen. The late and much missed Ian Richardson is superb as Urquhart, letting the audience in on his wicked plans as he wrecks lives and careers with not a smidgeon of remorse. Just as unscrupulous, though less obviously so until the end of the trilogy, is Urquhart's wife Elizabeth, such a wonderfully understated performance by Diane Fletcher that you will find yourself going back through the set to check that she really did say or do what you thought she did.<br /><br />It's rare that brilliant writing is matched by equally magnificent acting, but that's what you'll find in this set. The ensemble cast is top-rate, especially Michael Kitchen, of Foyle's War, doing an immediately identifiable impersonation of a certain Royal figure in 'To Play The King'. The series is also fascinating for its behind-the-scenes glimpses into the workings of British Parliamentary democracy, so different from the American system.<br /><br />If you love intrigue, betrayal, and deliciously villainous political characters, this is simply the best series ever produced. Those who are offended by such things should note, however, that it does contain nudity and explicit sexual situations as well as some violence.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Great music! I was not even aware of some of the music in this collection. The tunes bring back awesome memories. It is a must for Beatles fans.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|First up--be aware that you may have to do an update on your player otherwise the Blu-ray will free up about 30 minutes before the film concludes. This isn't a 3 disc set but a 2 disc set (the 3D edition IS a 3 disc set from what I gather)--we get the Blu-ray, a DVD and a code for streaming the Ultraviolet Digital copy. I'm a bit disappointed it won't work on an iPad.<br /><br />\\"Green Lantern\\" may have fallen short of fan expectations but it wasn't for lack of trying;the story focuses on one of the Green Lantern's greatest enemies Parallax and gives us a good introduction to the Corp and its history.<br /><br />The main flaw of \\"Green Lantern\\" is the lack of movement in the second act of the film--the story has to include TWO origin stories one for our hero and one for the bad guy which brings the film to a stand still at one point. Still, \\"Green Lantern\\" is entertaining and Ryan Reynolds brings his characteristic charm and humor to the role.<br /><br />We get both the theatrical cut and the extended edition which includes more background on Hal Jordan's childhood and the death of his father. A couple of other scenes are extended and rearranged a bit but otherwise the film is, essentially, the same in terms of the story being told.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks terrific with a sharp looking, detailed transfer and a terrific lossless audio soundtrack that positively will shake your room. I haven't had to update my firmware in quite some time and although some Blu-rays take a bit longer to load, it hasn't ever effected playback on my Sony player until now. It's a minor complaint but something fans should be aware of if they try to watch it immediately when you get home.<br /><br />The special features include a terrific Maximum Movie Mode that allows you to see behind-the-scenes footage, commentary, featurettes, storyboards, character bios, etc. as well as deleted scenes. We also get a Justice League digital comic, \\"The Universe According to Green Lantern\\" featurette.<br /><br />Although flawed director Martin Campbell's film has the larger-than-life drama and comic book sense of wonder that is essential (and a sense of humor)for a film like this to work for the average audience member. The freezing issue with the Blu-ray was a bit of a pain but it was pretty easy to remedy.<br /><br />Although flawed director Martin Campbell's film has the larger-than-life drama and comic book sense of wonder that is essential (and a sense of humor)for a film like this to work for the average audience member.

B004XWLN20|5.0|I gotta say, while i have not purchashed this particular box set, i have been watching smallville for ages and own seasons 1-9 on dvd and looking forward to season 10 hitting australia, i think this is the best tv show ever, i have watched the series all the way through, then watched 7-9 again and now i'm watching it all the way through again. I love what they have done with the series, although a few things they could have done differently regarding the story line, but it's still and always will be my fav show. I love how they went from Clark as a teenager discovering his powers and eventually getting to superman, i'm sure if DC were not happy with it all they would not have approved it, so if they are happy with it i'm happy with it after all they are just telling stories that maybe weren't covered by the comics
0887431461|4.0|I got this book for my 5 year old son who just started kindergarten, to supplement his learning. He loves it, and works on it everyday after he gets home from school.   There are lessons for things he knows in this book, and some things that he will be learning later.

0385534639|5.0|I adored this story! It's everything you want a book to be...great writing, interesting characters, a story that weaves you into it's web from the first chapter...adventure, romance, mystery, magic.  I didn't want it to end.   One of the best written novels I've read for a long time...BRAVO!!!  I can't imagine it being a movie but I'll be there to see it the first day!  Please write another book!!!!
B005LY4B0A|3.0|I like this game.  The graphics and animation are good and some levels are quite challenging.  I saw this game running on an HTC Evo and it looked great.  Unfortunately, on my Toshiba Thrive it does not scale properly and looks terrible.  The game opens in a small window at the top of the screen in landscape mode but the game background and some images are spread all over the screen.  The game play is limited to the game window though and the game is playable.  I wish it scaled properly for tablets, so I m taking one star off for that.<br /><br />UPDATE 10-16-11:  I am taking one more star off after the latest update.  Either the developer is not aware of Android tablets, or he does not care about them, or he does not know what he is doing.  This latest update made this game look like such a mess on my Toshiba Thrive. Now the game play is bigger than the screen.  Some flies are outside the screen.  The words in the menu do not align with buttons anymore.  It just looks terrible.
B003L77GRO|2.0|When Dexter season 5 was airing on showtime, I was at the edge of my seat. It appeared to be the best season ever, right up until the last episode. However, all that was built up was quickly toppled by the meaningless ending. The season started with him having lost the kids (minus the baby), and his wife. Than, the writers who are apparently too chicken to do anything original, end the season by putting Dex back in the same predicament he was in before the season started: the kids are back and he's all alone without a woman in his life. BORING. WHAT is the point of having us invest in Lumen if their only going to remove her? It was a massive waste of time and shows how unoriginal this series has become with time. I won't be paying for another season of Shotime. Trust me when I say that season 6 will suck. Because season 5 was the 1st chance the writers had to give meaning to Dexter's life; and they just blew it. Now, we're in season 6 and i'm supposed to believe that things will get better? Ugh. Most shows end at season 6. Where exactly is this show going? Meh...2 stars overall for the season (5 if they kept Lumen and made Dex have to work harder at getting the kids back into his life)
0767020308|3.0|I write this as I am currently watching this version on Ovation Network. I do not like the characters in this adaptation as well as the ones in Paltrow version. They all seem much older than what I envisioned them to be based on the book. And none of them seem as likeable. This Emma is much more snobbish and doesn't seem to have the kindness as she does in either the book or Paltrow chracter. That kindness made Emma bearable even in her few episodes of snobbery (her insult of Mrs. Bates at the picnic). Miss Bates is portrayed as being quite elderly and would not likely be in the company of those of Emma's generation. In fact, even Emma is portrayed as older than the 21 years she is supposed to be. The only character I liked better in this version was Harriet Smith   I don't think I would have liked this version even if I hadn't seen the other one first.
1594744769|3.0|I love the creepy vintage photos that inspired the story! They are perfectly suited to the writer's style, and I found the story to be fresh and unique.   A glaring flaw, however, is that the author clearly has no ear for language at all, yet chose 1940s Wales as a setting and created a cast from all across Europe. With the exception of Miss Peregrine (who has few lines), all of the characters sound like they're from some corner of Ohio where no one uses any slang. Additionally, the dialogue flounders during the action scenes.  I was also disappointed on reaching the end of the book to find no conclusion. Clearly it is intended to be the first of a series, which is a fiction trend I don't care for. I would have preferred Riggs put more effort into writing one really good book than what promises to be a watered-down and repetitive series.
1904994679|5.0|The Guiness Book of World Records with PICTURES and in the hardback edition is the BEST!  My students love it!  It is the American Dream to make it in the Guiness Book of World Records!!!
076115678X|5.0|Had heard about this book for several years but never got around to purchasing it.  Then a few weekends ago I saw a friend with curly hair that I had not seen in about a year.  Her hair looked wonderful.  Big healthy curls, no frizz, no halo!  Nothing but healthy curls.  Of course I immediately asked her what products she was using and she told me it wasn't the products but she was following this method.  Came home and ordered the book.  Turns out I was doing a lot of it correctly but just not completely correctly.  I had all the correct shampoo and I was shampooing only my scalp but not correctly so making my long ends really tangle.  Also even though I thought I was using enough conditioner my hair was dying of thirst and needed a lot more.<br /><br />Bottom line, today is my 2nd hair day and my hair looks wonderful.  Soft long curls, no frizz, no halo and looks healthy for the first time in years.  And that is only with one time going by her method.  I have finally found the Holy Grail for my very long curly hair!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love Jillian! At first I was hesitant to try any of her videos as she does have the reputation of being the toughest trainer out there.  Becuase I do yoga, I initially worked out with Yoga Meltdown and was very impressed with her supportive and firm attitude.  I also appreciate her humility regarding not being so flexible.  I am very happy with the results that I have gotten espcially the new muscle tone.  So I wanted to add some aerobic to burn fat faster and let the muscle come through.  After reading reviews on her workout videos, I decided I wanted to try 30 Day Shred.  Still I was hesitant because it was a yoga video that I had used and Jillian has her reputation.  So I borrowed the video from the library.  Since the first morning that I used it, I was hooked.  Still the same supportive and firm Jillian.  Challenging, yet allowing the individual to progress at their own pace.  It is the fastest 22 minutes.  All the different moves keep it interesting and engaging.  I love the moves that work both the arms and the legs at the same time. Sometimes they can feel like the slowest 30 seconds ever, but the burn is weakness leaving the body. I've felt more energy and I feel a difference in the fit of my clothes.  And I've only used it for a week, every other day with Yoga Meltdown in between.  I love that the workouts are less than 30 minutes and I am seeing results.  I feel great after a workout, ready to take on the day ahead.  And yes, I've fully committed and have purchased 30 Day Shred DVD with Ripped in 30.  Thank you to all Amazon reviewers!  You have helped me to make great choices for myself. :)
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Short Answer:  This album was meh.    This album was acceptable, but I never really got into it.  I've never been a fan of the club scene, so it's content was hard for to understand.  I also didn't like the change to her sound.  It was nice for one album (Britney), but it would have been better if it stopped there.  Now it's at least a half a decade later, and she is still doing the same thing.

1573229725|3.0|There was an underlying lesbian theme which was unnecessary but as a whole this was a very good book.  The historical background was very well written. I could clearly picture the various characters and events.  Many unexpected twists and turns to the plot.
B0051CSI0G|2.0|The idea of the movie might have had some potential and the fx are quite ok but:  Did they use a script at all? I really doubt that as I can´t find any plot +  the acting is so unbelievable poor it makes any soap opera looking Oscar worthy.  Luckiely I just rented the movie, but I won´t get those 1 ½ hours back...
B005SH5K7I|5.0|After being hounded by my 8-year old son, I reluctantly rented this movie and we watched together.  HIllarious! He and I laughed throughout the entire movie.  I did not expect to like it, but I did. We recognized the voice of the gorilla as having been the voice of the bear in the movie \\"Over the Hedge\\". However - the monkey stole the show.

B004L07KWQ|5.0|I'm pretty sure my four year old and I enjoy this app the same amount. There is something incredibly relaxing about swyping your fingers across the black canvas paper that your screen becomes and making even a simple drawing.   I initially had the issue with the clear screen pop up other users are complaining of as well but rebooted and it seemed to resolve itself. I do wish as others have suggested that there was a way to lock this app as you can some other children apps because every time my daughter uses my phone to play she hands it back to me and is in a menu I didn't know existed.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|DO NOT BUY THE DIGITAL COPY VERSION! Total waste of money, not compatible with Apple products!!! You have to Create a separate account with Flixster to watch a movie you own...and only be able to watch it over wi-fi? WHAT A RIP! That is not a copy..FALSE ADVERTISING! Do not support this medium, hasn't anyone learned from netflix?
B00009R86L|5.0|It works, 'nuff said.  Anything with a strap easily attaches to his shoulder pad.  It stays in place on the shoulder yet adjusts easily, it does an excellent job at distributing weight and reducing hot-spots, and it is made out of high-quality materials.  Slam dunk.  It looks funny, sure, but that's a minor quibble.  I bought two of these and use them daily for my sling bag, messenger bag, laptop bag, and digital camera bag.  When I change bags, I just unhook the Domke and put it on the next bag.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I really don't understand why the Amazon continue to keep all these reviews together for so many different products.  I never bought STAR WARS movies before, and the only one I saw was the first original one (IV episode), many years ago. Back then I considered it one of the worst movies I ever saw in my life.:-) Few weeks ago I decided to buy whole series on Blu-ray, in one package, and started to watch the movies with my kids. Wow! I like all of them! I really don't care if they are the originals or not, and why all these people complained about that, but I definitely recommend these Blu-rays. The image and the sound are amazing, and the special effects in the newest three episodes are not over-the-board (like in most movies these days) and all six of them are pretty uniform in playing, action scenes, music etc.  Neat format - all 9 discs together - looks like a book and every disc has its own place inside. Fast shipping & great delivery of this collection!
B0039TD7RC|5.0|My introduction to The Rolling Stones was short, but my love for the band was forever initiated by this album.   Upon first whiff, 'Exile on Main St.' delivers a strong, driving force with 'Rocks Off'. Jagger's vocals show signs of maturity while Richards' guitar remains consistent with a riff that gets you up and moving. Then comes the horns. Lyrics of 'I can't even feel the pain no more' and the mesmerizing interlude before the song comes back in full Stones glory set a tone for the entire 18-track album: simplistic, timeless, but hardly sweet. The next four songs share of fun times sprinkled with the pain of loving and, at one point, gambling. (That's thanks the extended metaphor of 'Tumbling Dice,' of course!)   Upon the reverse side of the vinyl, or 'Sweet Virginia' as many now know it, the Stones greet life's afflictions with the tenderness of a different world, or of a different genre -- true blues, perhaps? Jagger's lyrics once again depict a scene, this time one of life gone wrong without the wall of rock and roll of the former songs. Beginning with 'Sweet Virginia,' Americana sets in with a hint of that British brilliance we've come to know and love. For some, 'Torn and Frayed' may bring gospel to mind, while for others 'Sweet Black Angel' is a stream of backwood memories, both with their variety of sounds including the sweetness of harmonicas and horns. The guitar, of course, delivers edge and nothing but.  Side three opens with Richards' turn at vocals. The song 'Happy' is a rich, soulful tune with a certain twang that keeps you up at night. As Richards' gritty voice hits the high notes and emphasizes the premise of the song -- romance and happiness -- one might not be prepared for the songs that follow. But these songs, as one will find out, are the secret to the beauty of the album. 'Turd on the Run' is a rock n' roll classic; just the title is enough to send shivers down one's spine. 'I Just Want to See His Face' is an interlude of sorts, a departurefrom the previous songs that in some ways is more soulful than other tunes of the album. As we progress to 'Let it Loose' one is bombarded with American blues, or even jazz. Piano marks the song as one to hear (as nearly all of the album is). As Jagger sings, the song will 'Take the shine right off yer shoes.'  Finally, side four opens to the rockabilly we've always yearned for. While not strictly rock, 'All Down the Line' is sliced straight through the middle with the piercing guitar we've grown accustomed to. Backup vocals shine as Richards bursts through, his crass voice just one of the great landmarks of the album. The final three songs are some of the real gems -- not to mention the final track, 'Soul Survivor,' which is questionably the most striking track of the whole lot.  To summarize: 'Exile on Main St.' is timeless, classic, and must be simply cannot be missed. A breakthrough for the early seventies, the songs are of the Rolling Stones the world is enamored with -- the forty-something year love affair lingers on. Fantastic all around.
B005I64U5C|4.0|I won't get into the movie here - this review is strictly about the digital copy in that it's not like every other digital copy where you either have a disk with an activation code or a download code for iTunes.  Warner Bros. has decided to go with Flixster - so now you have to download a separate application for your PC, phone and Tablet if you want to watch the digital copy.  If you have an Apple TV - you're completely out of luck being able to watch this on your TV.  This is the last Warner Bros. movie I will buy - period.
1594202842|5.0|The point: We are now competing with China and other Asian countries in a global economy. White kids are on X-Box. Asians are studying Mozart and working their butts off to get into Ivy, MIT, CIT, and Stanford. Tilt. Game over. I just hope that Asian-Americans will step into the fray - and that's what it is - and themselves insure America's future, saving a nation which at first did not accept them.
B002ZG980A|1.0|I rented this film and didn't like it at all. The characters were so outrageously twisted that they make gay people look ridiculous and sick. Overall, this is not a positive film in my opinion. I no longer want to buy it. McGregor was just okay, given the script was so bad. Carrey, not so much. The whole film left me feeling sick.
1423140591|3.0|Another fun adventure by Riordan, but the formula is the same.  Demigods, quest, monsters, save the day, hooray!<br /><br />It was great to see Percy back in action & we already understood the Greek/Roman twist thanks to the first Heroes of Olympus book, but the truth is, Percy was missing something without his Greek friends & he was a bit mopey in this book- as were the demigods he was questing with, Hazel & Frank- which made it a little less fun to read than the previous Riordan books I've enjoyed.  The adventure was still fun, but I'm hoping with the 3rd book in the series, when everyone is reunited that Percy & the gang will get their zing back.  This book was really just a bridge & it felt like it.
0446547654|2.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks books and can't wait all year until another one is released so I was really anticipating The Best of Me. My husband go it for me the day it was released and I took it with me on your anniversary trip. When I started it right off the bat I didn't have that \\"I can't put this down\\" feeling that most of his books give me. And as the book went on it was interesting from time to time but the whole idea that she was married and married with three kids while loving another man and involving herself with him was a big turn off. In the Notebook where she is engaged and has no children it seems more appropriate. Then there is so much with the crazy family and their awful lives and how they want to kill everyone and treat them bad - if I want to read that kind of book I would have picked a different author. The whole transplant thing with the son was so cliche it ruined the ending for me - so disappointed come on Sparks you are better than this you didn't give us \\"The Best of You\\"!
B001LF347E|4.0|I love this program. I watched all three seasons in three days. I wish I could see episode 4 now. Sadly I've learned it is only available in the UK. I hope they bring this show to the US.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|amazing game. provides hours hours of fun! even at $1.99 i would highly recommend this app to anyone looking to kill time or have fun(:
B00459EZ7Q|5.0|I really loved this version of the SG series.  The others were just full of fluff compared to this very dark iteration.  The production values (except for the less than stellar dual reality planet) were outstanding for a TV series.  Now if only SyFy would bring it back...
B002NPUCIA|5.0|La producción es impecable. El vídeo es de alta calidad. La música es excelente e inspiradora.   Mis estudiantes de secundaria quedan con ganas de ver el resto después de ver un tema. Brian Culbertson es un gran músico.  Amazon lo trajo a Colombia rápidamente.  100% recomendado.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|We had it foe my ds1 3yrs ago n he loved it. When we my ds2 arrived, i decided to get it for him too~~
B0056BMK6K|3.0|John Locke has to be a hero to any self-publishing author. Who wouldn't like to sell a million copies or more of their books? Unfortunately this book is all about John Locke and his view of the world and I didn't like him from it. I understand that he isn't aiming to write high art but in this book you'll find out that he doesn't even favour his readers with the best writing he is capable of; instead he dashes it out because it's good enough. There are plenty of writers whose books are light but who labour hard on the prose nonetheless. Maybe it's just me but but John Locke seems to love his readers for their money but have contempt for them otherwise.<br /><br />Yes, there are some tips in here that you could emulate and he's not promising that they'll get you to a million copies, which is just as well because it would be a fraud.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|get off your butt and get this cd into your life!  i'm not kidding.  i am a J-A-D-E-D record store employee who has been working music retail since god was born, and it takes a freakin' lot to impress me these days...especially with so much crap being put out on the radio that sucks.  i'd never even heard of this guy until today, but i put his cd in the player to see what it sounded like, and immediately i liked it.  at first there were 2 or 3 tracks i didn't care for as much cuz i don't go for contemporary r'n'b vocal type stuff (i'm mostly a rocker), but after listening thru a second time, i find that even the \\"weak\\" tracks are better than the crap that's in rotation on pop/r&b radio.  it's a nice mix of funk, retro-like jazzy latiny groove, totally modern hip hop, occasional rock guitar thrown in, and awesome horn blowing with the energy and heart beating excitment of a football marching band ...all this love from a girl who doesn't even LIKE horns most of the time!  get this cd NOW!  i've already gone online to get tix to see him play Nashville this month.  Lucky me!  :)
B005N0BN58|4.0|I'm having the same problem too. Who can we report this to so we can get a credit or refund?
0307878937|5.0|Beautiful book, full of feelings and pain and happiness. The choices we make and the results we received. I have cried, I have my heart burn with compassion, and I have re-counted all the blessings I have and all the blessings that are still to come.<br /><br />The unabridged Audible edition by Tara Sands is exceptional.<br /><br />Victoria Evangelina
B005M2A4D4|4.0|Not the best season of Doctor Who but that wasn't the fault of the actors. The Stories while having their moments just are not very interesting and a bit predictable. Having said that series six is still worth having for any Doctor Who fan.
B005ELQVGW|1.0|I really don't want to write Bjork off as having lost the spark that originally made her such an unique artist all those many years ago, but this making lame album after lame album, doesn't seem to be a minor fluke anymore.  It's been more than a decade now since Bjork made a timeless album.  The last three albums have all had the same theme: nature.  This continues with \\"Biophilia\\".  The majority of Bjork's output these days, offer no melody, and completely bland lyrics.  Perhaps she's in a rut, but this has been one long rut if there's ever been one.  I don't mind the truly experimental album every once in awhile, but this is just a constant now.  She's no longer exciting, and the fans of these types of albums seem to be making themselves enjoy it, or are of the mindset that if they don't \\"get it\\", it must be art.  It isn't.  I'm no longer anticipating a decent Bjork album again.  If it happens, it happens.  She's seen better days.
0553582038|2.0|GRRM is making the same mistake that Robert Jordan made: never finishing his series.  I understand that writers love their stories and that publishers want to make money from the books they sell.  So, a popular series is like winning the lottery.  A story has to end, though, to be a good story.  This one just feels endless now.  I really enjoyed the first 3 books of this series, but this one... It's a lot of running around without much happening. I would have been OK with that if this was the portion of the story where things are just moving along to the climax in the next book.  However, having just read reviews of A Dance With Dragons and learning that it's just more of the same, I decided that I no longer care what happens to these characters.  And I'm 2/3 of the way through this one.  No matter how rich and detailed your world is and no matter how well drawn your characters are, it's boring to read about them if the story feels pointless and nothing is happening.  A little more intrigue and intelligent plotting like in the first 3 are REALLY needed here. Too bad and very disappointing.
B002N2P1SE|5.0|This was a great show, but the ending was terrible and very lame. You could tell the writters knew the end was coming to the show and they just kind of gave up and left a lot of open parts of the show.
B005CK76ZA|3.0|I received this 4 LP set in the mail yesterday.  It's pretty great....meaning it looks pretty great on my shelf.
B002ZNJW0O|3.0|The more I read Nicholas Spark's novels the more they seem to retread his past works with the same guy/girl hook-ups, and with similar character personalities. But, what the heck, it works or I wouldn't go back to them like I do. His writing has a nice flow and in the \\"The Lucky One\\" there is no bumps. Not only do you get the boy/girl hookup you get the wise old grandma, the infectious kid, and a smart courageous German shepherd. Good fun read!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|So much better than the Android or HTC stock clocks. I love the option to have the alarm start quietly then gradually get louder. Great app.
0553801473|1.0|I finished \\"Dance with Dragons\\" half an hour ago and was compelled to get online and write my first Amazon review. The book is terrible. Extremely disappointing. I loved the first three books in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, although I think you can tell that GRRM lost control of the story in \\"Storm of Swords\\". \\"Feast for Crows\\" was really bad, but the last 200 pages or so were engaging enough to make me look forward to the next installment. After \\"Dance with Dragons\\" I don't care if this series continues or not. Everything you've read in the other reviews is true: this is longest book in the series, but NOTHING HAPPENS. Well, sure, some stuff happens, but hardly anything that readers will care about. Your favorite characters? Either dead, soon-to-be-dead, acting inexplicably out of character, or not in this book at all. Maybe all of the above! In the first half of the book I thought, \\"At least it has Tyrion!\\" By the end of the novel I was wishing Tyrion had been spared the besmirching that befalls him in this terrible book. Not only does the plot fall woefully short of the gold standard established by the first two books in the series, but the writing quality is noticeably worse as well. \\"Game of Thrones\\" didn't just have great characters, excellent intrigue and action, and a fantastically realized world, but the prose was damn good, too! The writing in \\"ADWD\\" is so bad in parts that it seems like GRRM is taking the piss out of readers. Examples: *SPOILERS* Tyrion says \\"Should I prick my prick, as well?\\" and \\"I am tired of tinkling when I tinkle.\\" Jaime interrupts some people having sex (or \\"rutting\\" in GRRM's vernacular) and the man says to Jaime, \\"I was not told of your coming!\\" And Jaime says \\"I seem to have prevented yours.\\" And finally, in one of Dany's chapters she is watching a group of men with erections dance naked for her. The text says, \\"Their arousal was arousing, but Dany thought it looked comical, too.\\" WTF?? Anyway, GRRM can take another 5 or 6years to write the next book, I don't give a damn. The book was so bad as to not just be disappointing, but insulting as well. It really seems like this is a piece-of-trash book cynically churned out to continue to milk the millions of fans won over by the high quality of the first books and the HBO series. More power to him, I guess. I just hope the writers of the TV show significantly deviate from the novels after \\"Storm of Swords\\".
B001FB4W0C|5.0|IF possible, Supernatural becomes even better with the introduction of Angels themselves and even more horrid and dangerous demons.  Each character continues to progress and we watch their season long internal struggles. I love this series, I hope it continues FOREVER.
B000000WFZ|5.0|The music to the Mission is haunting, lovely, and very contemplative. This music will stay in your heart forver. I highly recommend this to any classical or soundtrack lover. Excellent score.
B001LNOOG6|5.0|Archer crafts a captivating page turner of the little guy, the uneducated, wrong side of the tracks innocent who falls victim to ruthless high brow inside players. Danny endures watching his best friend get killed only to be convicted of his murder. He continues to face danger even while in prison through efforts to maintain the frame-up. When an attempt to eliminate Danny results in the death of his bunkmate and close friend, the tale deliciously unfolds into a dish of revenge served cold. Of particular note is the plot twists that are compelling, unconventional, and definitely not the standard Hollywood style (although this would render a good screenplay). All in all, this is a solid hard-to-put down story by a master storyteller.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Even better and more mature than its last season.  The storytelling is phenomenal and crazy. The monsters you've heard about that frightened you as a little kid come to life. And there as some that come to the big screen that you think will be impossible to actually create, but the Supernatural team manages to pull each one off perfectly. With episodes like Nightshifter, Croatoan and Hunted.   Be prepared for an even more emotional ride with this season. It pulls at your heartstrings in the way the Winchester brothers have to deal with some of the things they deal with. Supernatural train, ABOARD!!!
B005LJITKI|4.0|Charlie Day steals the show in this very funny comedy with a terrific cast.  Definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time, as well as among summer 2011 movies which were lackluster.  I didn't realize Jennifer Aniston could be so funny - great comedienne.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Since the beginning this show has known how to captivate audiences. And the character development is amazing. If you look at the characters now (going into season 7) and in this season...you would never have known the journey that they would go through to change who they were.  Characters: Dean Winchester. Funny guy, seen as a ladies man and doesn't like talking about his feelings. Loyal to his father and grew up as a Hunter. Doesn't know a life from anything different.   Sam Winchester: The school boy. Left home for school, had a normal life with a girlfriend and good grades. Dragged back into the life of \\"The Hunters\\" and hunts alongside with his brother.  Plot: Usually stand alone episodes, but there is always a season long story arc that surfaces and concludes by the end of the season. Paced perfectly and balanced between drama and comedy.  Acting: Acting is overly exceptional, especially Jensen Ackles (plays Dean Winchester). Not many characters on television can actually have you FEELING for them like the Winchester brothers can.   Overall: The start of something amazing that every can easily enjoy if they give it a chance. Even if you think this isn't the series for you, it is painfully addicting and will constantly have you on the edge of your seats. Give it a try.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Intelligent and addictive problem solving. Very fun strategy game. Play it!  -- - -- --  --  - - - - -
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Usually as a television series progresses, it gets worse. The actors are semi burned out with the writing and production. The plots start to repeat themselves. The characters become cliche and boring.  Supernatural seems to have completely avoided that loop. Because the writing is so FRESH I think is the reason Jensen and Jared always perform at their best and finest. Every season is something different, and not a lot of series can actually say that about themselves.  Kudos to Supernatural.  The only complaint is that it was 16 episodes. I know the writers strike cut it off, so I'm not too upset about it. The emotional ending will I think make all the viewers forgive the cut off.
B0018LX9T4|3.0|Watched this for the first time last night on cable, surprised to see it was in theatres. However, it kept my attention,it sent alot of messages. You have to get it, or you will be lost,it was arrousing,none the less. You could feel the excitement she felt when being spanked.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This is an emotional roller coaster. Kudos once again to the writers.  Introducing frighteningly powerful characters such as God and Lucifer themselves, you will NEVER expect what happens next. Which is what makes this show so amazing.  The Winchester brothers are pushed to emotional endurance as event after event after event happen that push their mental states into insanity. Sam is questioning everything,frustrated with the world around him and his brother won't let him help him.  Dean is shutting everyone out, losing faith in his brother and rapidly breaking inside.  And can I say that the finale is a masterpiece. Pure perfection if there over was such a thing. The family values all add up, the love you can feel between the two brothers and the things they are willing to sacrifice for the other. Prepare the tissues for the finale; it's the best one yet.
0446563048|4.0|I read this book very relunctantly prejudjing it as yet another shallow self-improvement sermon.<br /><br />In fact, I wasn't totally wrong. There is something simplistic about this book, including a number of heroic autobiographical references.  But I gladly accepted them mainly because of the humble nature of the narration and modest references to mistakes as much as successes.<br /><br />The \\"our branding is our culture\\" part (ie, the second half of the book) is excellent and reflects real mastery and passion.  Despite the fact that Zappos mainly operated a \\"call center\\", they redefined the category a little bit like the Cirque du Soleil redefined the circus category. Hsieh had the courage to admit (and persuade his peers) that in the 21st Century, Operational Excellence didn't not come from decisions made in a vacuum by a small group of white collars and uniformly executed by masses of factory workers. Knowing WHAT to do is now equally (if not more) important that knowing HOW to do things.  Command and Control doesn't wok any more. The best one can do is to influence an ecosystem.  To do that, one needs consistent multi-channel multi-touchpoint multi-media multi-actor multi-sensory efforts. And good technology.  And agility.  All of this is well reflected in Hsieh's book.<br /><br />In summary, despite a few redundancies and boring stretches, I enjoyed this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So, the new Nicholas Sparks book has hit the shelves and the web! Everyone is buzzing about it. But I am still buzzing about this book. I have not had a chance to read The Best Of Me yet, but I think Safe Haven is his best book in a couple years. I liked The Last Song but not as much as The Lucky One. I thought the pilot in this book was amazing. The connection between Alex and Katie/Erin is loveable. Even though it took her a long time to trust him and kept her guard up for a long time, she soon realized that he was nothing like her husbend.<br /><br />I loved the instant connection she had with the little girl, that's what rose the connection between her and Alex. And the suspense!!!!!! I have never seen so much suspense in one of his books. And not the suspense of, when are they just going to make love already... No, the suspense of not knowing when Katie/Erin husbend was going to find her. I loved it!! I also liked that Alex and Katie/Erin had never known each other in their past life. They didn't go to high school together, or were high school sweethearts, like a lot of his other books.<br /><br />The one and only other book I know of his that had this kind of suspense was The Guardian. But it wasn't like Safe Haven, which is much better than The Guardian.<br /><br />This book kept me up all hours of the night, I couldn't put it down and it kept me on my feet.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks needs to write more with this kind of suspense. I think this is his best work in a couple years.
B00563M11M|5.0|I love everything Pterry writes, I am a huge fan. There can be no doubt that this is his BEST book since Thud!  Commander Sam Vimes is back and we are treated to his usual dry wit and top policing. Sybil and Young Sam also star and how wonderful it is to see Sam so happy and interacting with his little family!  Mr Pratchet's books have certainly gotten darker over the years, but this amazing writer has the knack of still finding the humour and the humanity even in these darker themes.   Top top TOP book - if you love Sam Vimes you will LOVE this bok. If you loved Thud!, The Fifth Elephant, Jingo, or indeed any City Watch book you will love this book.  Almost forgot to mention the footnotes! Any Pratchett reader knows his famous footnotes, and it didn't occur to me how that would work on Kindle.  It's brilliant! The footnotes (numbered) are links. Press the number and it takes you to the footnote at the back of the book. When you're done press the number again and it takes you right back to your place in the book!  Along with Whispersync - this is one of the best Kindle features I've used!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have a Core 2 Quad and had a problem where my old OEM CPU fan wouldn't stay affixed to the board so the cpu would reach 80 degrees as soon as I turned on the computer and it wouldn't stay on for longer than 30 seconds.  With the OEM CPU fan it always ran hot about 70 degrees. I installed this beast and the temperatures went down to a steady 32 degrees!  It was a little cumbersome to install because I had to completely remove the motherboard and all components but after the mobo was removed it went in very easily.  I did not have any problems screwing it in, installation instructions were terrible little pictures but it was easy enough to figure out on my own.  The mounting is very sturdy.  Stays cool and it is consistent.  It is a little bulky but it does the trick and really well.  I would recommend this to anyone!
B0025KVLS8|5.0|I've been a big Beatles fan ever since they came to America. This is another Beatles CD that I've added to my collection. I think it's a great CD. I'd reccommend it to all the Beatle fans out there.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|So this was my first introduction into the Harry Bosch series and overall, the second book in the series. While guilty of a couple cliche's and contrived plot points, the writing itself was strong enough to overcome these shortcomings and in the end, the story ends up being a pretty enjoyable detective procedural/mystery. Harry himself is a fairly enjoyable character who at times was refreshingly different for a cop, but also falls victim to some of the cliche's of the genre with his chain smoking, lone wolf ways.<br /><br />Of course, this sense of Harry vs. the world type of story-telling allows you to empathize and relate to what Harry goes through quite nicely, but has the slightly adverse effect of making pretty much every other character not very well fleshed out and somewhat one-dimensional. Even Harry's primary love interest who's a central character in the story itself is little more than a pretty, albeit, grieving face who - of course (and IMO, far too quickly) - seeks comfort in Harry's arms.<br /><br />That being said, the mystery and how it unfolds was very satisfactory and kept you guessing very nicely until the very end, and after it was all said and done, there are a few mysteries that you don't ever quite get the answers too. The action was sporadic, but very well done when it existed. I particularly enjoyed the description of the bull-fight and the action down in Mexico. At times the writing was very strong and really drew me into the story and at other times was merely serviceable, but it never lapsed into poor or shoddy writing.<br /><br />Overall, I ended up enjoying the story and pacing well enough to definitely continue in the Harry Bosch series once I get the urge to read another crime novel again.

B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is intended for both YA and adults (I think that the adult will appreciate it more).  The author paints a pretty bleak,scary picture.  If you are enjoying the new Syfy series on Fox, about a new earth,you will enjoy this book.  The story isn't flashy, it might even be discribed as stark; but your immagination is all you'll need for a Wow of a time. Are we \\"givers\\" or \\"receivers\\"?    The book might have only taken me a day to read, but the story has stayed with me.  That makes it valuable to me. ENJOY

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I bought this product for my husband's birthday.  My husband runs 5K races frequently and and occasionally half marathons and marathons.

I am really pleased I found these albums and the concept is fantastic and the idea that all profits go to musical education in Africa and around the world is remarkable.<br />WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD THROUGH THE POWER OF MUSIC.<br />EVERYONE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS INITIATIVE.<br />THE BONUS IS YOUR HOUSE FILLED WITH GREAT MUSIC AND GOOD VIBES.<br />GUARANTEED !

B003VS0CX8|5.0|Look forward to the Blu-Ray - saw it in Todd-AO (curved screen, quasi-Cinerama) in Hollywood, 1965, can't remember which theatre, was in the navy, stationed in Long Beach, just remember the visuals were absolutely overwhelming (saw 2 other classics there - \\"Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf?\\" & \\"Lord Love A Duck\\") - the most inspired shot is the very beginning - as the film starts, you just hear a \\"whoosh\\" of air, against a totally white screen...(for a few seconds, you wonder, what's happening?...) then you realize the camera's moving through clouds.....that shot, along with numerous others, created an intense \\"involvement\\" that few films can achieve...I loved the movie, & from what the other reviewers have said, this must be the ideal release...
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I use this app constantly, so much so that I added it to one of my Circle Launcher icons on my phone so it's always handy. Anytime I need to jot something down, directions, shopping list -- this is the app for the job!  Turn your phone sideways for the easiest use -- more fingertip writing space that way.
B0013K1ALE|3.0|Yes guys, this was not released in the Uk? IT was of it's time and was great to watch and have as a lesson in what could be done by a great group.  Thank you for the memories,but who's idea was it not to release it in the Uk or Europe? Probably the same people who let people without Uk postcodes get tickets for the reunion gig at the O2, after saying you could only apply if you had a Uk postcode?  You can probably tell that I am a little bit cross about Money talking! but hey has'nt it always been that way.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is one of the few apps I've shelled out money for, being broke and cheap, and I'm glad I did. It's more than worth the price. It's just as good as the PC version and just as much fun. I was concerned that it wouldn't be easy to play, given the way the game works, but it's actually just as easy. If you loved the PC version, you'll love this app. And if you haven't played it, what are you waiting for?
0735204314|5.0|This is one of my favorite books hence why I have bought so many different versions of the book. So far I have found ISBN-13: 978-0735204317 to be the best and most complete with added updated comments by Murphy. ISBN-13: 978-0735201682 and ISBN-13: 978-0553583182 are both good editions with a table of content and index but they do not have the updated comments by Murphy as in the first edition I listed. ISBN-13: 978-1585427680 has a table of content but no index and has the free How to Attract Money Which I have not read yet. ISBN-13: 978-1604592016 is another edition with no table or content or index from what i can remember, I gave the copy I had away to a friend already but from what I recall it has neither. This was the first edition I bought ISBN-13: 978-1936594238 and LOVED the book for its message but it has no table of contents or index, newest published date but most incomplete.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is a great classic western series. Both the script and source novel are the best. I have noticed a couple of comments about the lack of video and sound quality. You obviously didn't purchase the Blu-ray re-processed version. If you want a sharp picture and 5.1 sound spend a copuple more dollars and get this later version.
0062513346|2.0|I wouldn't suggest this book, but it could be just where I am at on my path in life. I did not find it particularly interesting or inspiring. I kept reading though hoping it was going to get better.<br /><br />One interesting part to me though from the perspective that it was based on events from his actual life supposedly, kind of scary actually, he was into..I will call it the \\"dark side\\" of things before coming over to the \\"other side\\" and it tells about his experience and how it led to his path to the good side. Otherwise I did not get much from the book.<br /><br />Oh the most positive thing I took from the book which I never thought about before is when you look up and towards the horizon it changes your view of everything vs looking slightly down or straight ahead......I guess that applies literally and figuratively also as in positive uplifting thoughts vs negative thoughts.
0811879542|5.0|This book is my favourite one to read to young children AND share with adults.  My girlfriend who sells scholastic books chose this one to be her favourite book for children.

B000H7J9RQ|5.0|For years Barbra Sreisand fans have been demanding this concert see a DVD release and finally in 2006 this dream became a reality. Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of this special concert, Barbra's first in two decades, this collection is simply breathtaking. The concert footage has been cleaned, the audio upgraded, and the disc is a must have for fans of this legendary singer.<br /><br /> Highlights include \\"People\\", \\"Over The Rainbow\\" (Barbra's only known recording of this wonderful song in which she dedicates it to Judy Garland), \\"Papa, Can You Hear Me\\", and her duet with Barry Gibb, \\"Guilty\\", in which he performs with her.<br /><br /> This concert was aired on HBO in 1987 and quickly saw a home video release. Barbra did this to raise money for the Democrats, one of her many fundraising efforts.<br /><br /> In one word: a gem!

1400062071|3.0|This is the story of a small-town minister who loses his wife and is left with two young daughters and of how small-minded people nearly destroy the preacher's reputation and damage his troubled daughter.   There is a little bit of mystery and a small amount of sex and quite a bit of landscape description. It can be slow-moving, but it picks up around the middle and makes one want to read to the conclusion. Loose ends are tied up. Much is understated. I didn't laugh or cry. Perhaps my eyes were a bit moist by the end.   I read a memoir recently by a widower with a young daughter which made me cry so much. I usually prefer memoirs to novels as I have found that so many novels can be slow-moving, understated, and overly-descriptive. But I decided to give this one a try and it wasn't time wasted but it wasn't the kind of book that I'll treasure or want to re-read.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|For a comic strip hero, this movie did very well in presenting Thor.  It was also nice to have a hero who was not from the United States.  It had good action and very nice graphics.  I would recommend this movie to those who like action heros and want a weekend movie that is rememberable.
B005HETUNM|1.0|Feel free to watch the first ten minutes of this episode.  Then skip to the end.  The rest consists entirely of Riker's flashbacks (aka bits of previous episoded) that don't move the story along at all.  This is a common practice for writers that have lost their creative muse.  It's sad that it's the season's final episode.  WEAK!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Can't get enough of Bosch!  No story details, but Harry Bosch, the quintessential detective who brings to mind that other detective named Harry, is great.    I bought this to tide me over until The Drop is released and really enjoyed these stories.  It's an inexpensive way to get introduced to Bosch for those not familiar with him.  I've read every Bosch book and so far, the worst of Harry from Michael Connelly is better than the best of most writers.
1584282584|2.0|I feel Neil has made a book out of a pamphlet. The premise is simple and explained early in the book: Point your on-camera flash at a large surface, that surface then becomes a beautiful soft light source. The chosen surface should be behind and slightly to the side of the camera for ideal beauty lighting. That's really it! The remainder of the book continues to beat this concept to death with little variation.   The majority of the sample photos show a before and after comparison which is exactly what you hope for in a book like this. Yet, time and again, I felt that by the time Neil perfected the technical elements the pose or scene itself had become forced and lifeless. Fiddling with buttons and settings, chimping the results on the LCD to perfection, had left the intimate energy behind.   There is definitely a limitation to what can be achieved with an on-camera flash, and a creative limitation is imposed when we become more worried about lifting every little shadow than bringing out the best in the pose. It seems that this book, in it's own way, has exposed these limitations. Some techniques in this book are important to know, and you will pick these up quickly in the first few chapters. Other techniques immerse you in a minutia of tiny manipulations and adjustments that take you away from the client and are probably better left to the post-production process.   This was a disappointing read, coming after two excellent books I have read recently: David Ziser's \\"[[ASIN:0321646878 Captured by the Light: The Essential Guide to Creating Extraordinary Wedding Photography]]\\" and Lee Varis' \\"[[ASIN:0470592125 Skin: The Complete Guide to Digitally Lighting, Photographing, and Retouching Faces and Bodies]].\\" I feel that the one chapter about on-camera lighting in Ziser's book more than covers this topic, while \\"Skin\\" will help you bring excellent results in post-production.
0307888681|3.0|I enjoy zombie books but this one can be as dissapointing as it is fun. It reads like a collection of short stories. While each one is good, it still leaves you wanting more than just that. Goes to show that the whole is more than the sum of its parts.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|At first I didn't think I'd finish this book.  Rachel comes across right off the get-go as spoiled, annoying, silly, and leading a pointless lifestyle (hence the 4 stars, rather than 5.) I'm glad I hung in there long enough to figure out that this is a story of a serious, and seriously un-aware, drug addict and her journey to recovery.  Altthough this book has the de rigeur \\"happy ending,\\" it is really about so much more than that.  The author's description of some of the factors that contribute to the heroine's drug use and dependency are chillingly realistic; and much more common, I suspect, than is comfortably acknowleged.  As a parent, and now a grand-parent, I'll be thinking about this book for quite some time, I think.  This book is better than the initial product description and review would have you think.  On re-reading those, I'm not quite sure why I made the decision to buy this book in the first place.  Now, I'm glad I did; and I'd highly recommend this book to others.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|If you like movies that are essentially plotless with no character development this is the movie for you.  While the cinematography was pretty it was one diffuse scene after another and very few scenes tied together.  After all the build up from the critics who often raved about the film, I felt really ripped off.  But I can imagine that for people who love artsy symbolism and lots of vague metaphor and who don't care about dialogue or a coherent plot  - this would be viewed as a great movie. To me it was emperors new clothes and the emperor was certainly naked.
0446547654|3.0|I started reading Nicholas Sparks' books last year.  I read one after the next until I read through his entire collection. He is, by far, my favorite author.  That being said, I couldn't wait for this novel to come out.  I bought the book the day it was released and couldn't put it down.  I loved it....UNTIL THE ENDING!  It was pretty predictable as some others said.  As I was reading the final chapters, I was hoping my prediction was wrong.  The ending totally killed the story. I sure hope the movie ends differently.  I was so disappointed!  I still love Nicholas Sparks.  If you are new to reading his books, I highly recommend The Lucky One and The Choice, two of my favorites.

0553582038|3.0|Like a lot of people, I was turned on to this series after watching the HBO series.  Thankfully, the books are so much better than the show.  I picked up the first four books as part of a collection.  The first book was interesting, but a little boring (something I attribute to having watched the first season and knowing all of the plot points).  Books two and three were extremely well-written.  While reading the third book, however, I noticed Martin taking shortcuts in his descriptions of battles and climatic events.  For example, there would be a huge build up and then, in the next chapter, the battle would be over and one of the characters would make reference to the battle (\\"It was won\\" or \\"It was lost\\" - paraphrasing), but other than that, no other details were offered.  Book four - A Feast for Crows - builds on the aforementioned shortcuts.  Battles/events are quickly glossed over and, in their place, we're given exposition, scheming, topographical details and information about banners, houses, doublets, gorgets, the latest fashions and colors ad nauseum.  For an author who clearly loves the details of the world he's created, shortchanging key battles/events and, in turn, the reader, undermines the story and, in my case, my ability to become immersed in the story.    Additionally, this book plods along at an excruciatingly slow pace.  It doesn't pick up until around 600 pages in (there are only 976 pages total) and the font size and line spacing is larger than in the previous three books (so you're actually getting less of a book).  Regardless of this review, the overall series continues to hold my interest.  I want to know what happens to the characters, despite the growing sense that what I'm actually reading is a glorified harlequin novel, set in a knock off version of the Lord of the Rings universe.    If Amazon would allow me to give this book 2.5 stars, I would.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I started watching Castle on TV at the end of season 2.  Now that I am into season 4, I needed to see how it all started.  I am not disappointed.  This first season has a noticeable fresh approach to the genre.  The characters while not fully developed in personality (understandably so early on), are slightly exaggerated version of their current selves, especially Castles mom.  This left me with a feeling kin to flipping through a high school year book, seeing funny pictures of them in the past.  Everyone has matured and mellowed now, the plot too.  The Castle/Beckett interaction is quirky, playful and fun which is different from today's more serious tone.  I highly recommend watching the first season if you are like me and started part way through the series.
0060797509|5.0|My mom read this series to me when I was young, and I've held a soft spot for them ever since.  So, it was wonderful to read them again as an adult and find Laura Ingalls Wilder's writing just as intriguing, captivating, fascinating and beautifully sweet!<br /><br />Laura is only about three years old here, and the story centers around one year in her life.  In addition to Laura there is her older sister Mary, and Ma, Pa, and Baby Carrie.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me upon rereading this was how \\"slow\\" it initially seemed.  Compared to all the middle-grade action/adventure books I typically read and love, here, all we really talked about was food and food preparation.  And yet, after a few pages I realized I was somehow completely sucked in and really wanted to know just how things were done then.  In chapters that follow things get more exciting - there are bear encounters, trips to town (can you imagine having never seen a town, never having seen even two houses together before?), cougars, bee attacks, harvests and even a dance at Grandma and Grandpa's where everyone gets dressed in their finest!<br /><br />I was also amazed at how many things had stayed with me from just one reading years and years ago!  Vivid images and recollections of scenes that obviously intrigued me to know end - and, frankly, still do!  The maple sugar sweets, for one!)<br /><br />Laura Ingalls Wilder never uses a big vocabulary, so her books can appeal to a huge age range!  And even with the limited vocabulary, she's somehow always so descriptive and you get a real sense for how each character feels and what they believe.  This, in combination with the wonderful illustrations by Garth Williams is like a very clear window into life in the Big Woods.<br /><br />After the first few chapters, once I got into the flow of the story, I found myself wanting to constantly pick up the book and read the next chapter.  There are so many fantastic stories, too, and there are wonderful messages on practically each page.  The messages are never heavy hitting, but they are there simply in the way the story unfolds.  Everything from self-reliance, responsibility, hard work, sharing, caring, listening, truthfulness, progress, respect, even environmentalism!  It sounds all quite boring laid out like this, but these characteristics are woven into exciting stories in Laura's life or tales her Pa tells her of him as a boy or family.<br /><br />It's very clear how much Laura loves her family, and the insights she brings to the book - to life - are incredible and touching!<br /><br />I love this book so much it's hard for me to write a good review of it, but I hope you'll pick it up, give it a few chapters to adjust to the pace, and then become just as captivated as I was - and fall just as much in love.never heavy hitting, but they are there simply in the way the story unfolds.

0385534639|3.0|I read this book a few weeks ago & wasn't going to write a review, but one thing will not leave my mind, so I'm going to write this briefly.   First, I thought this book was OK, but I don't understand all the hype about it. I think some of the characters needed a lot more development, especially Celia & Marco. They were supposed to be the main characters, but I didn't feel their love story, & I was just confused by their ending. There were a lot of people in this book, probably too many. Not all of them contributed enough to the story, & some of them, like Bailey, seemed like they were tacked on without really explaining what their purpose was. I heard that Summit Entertainment bought the movie rights, judging by what they did to the Twilight books, I'm guessing there will be a lot less plot & people when the movie comes out.   Now to that scene. Prospero teaching the child Celia how to heal herself by slicing open her fingertips while she cries haunts me. It pops into my mind at random moments & just horrifies me. I don't think there's another scene in this book (except maybe the one where Prospero casually crushes Celia's wrist)that has stuck in my head like this. Maybe it's the fact that Prospero never pays for his cruelty, or the supposedly HEA ending doesn't really seem all that HEA, but I think a book that is over 300 pages long & heavily hyped should leave more in my mind that two scenes of child abuse.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Great old school RPG! Almost tempted to dust off the SNES. Difficult to put down. Well worth the money, but careful about the cost of social life.
1416596097|3.0|This book appealed to me when I saw it in Politics & Prose because it is set in Hamburg, a city I lived in for two and half years and visited again for the first time in a long time in September. It is classic Le Carr&eacute; -- smoke and mirrors, betrayal upon betrayal, a pervasive cynicism limned with the slightest glimmer of hopeless idealism.<br /><br />But I'm still puzzling over Alan Furst's over-the-top praise for the book in his NYT Book Review piece, blurbed on the cover, that this is Le Carr&eacute;'s strongest, most powerful novel. It is certainly accomplished, but far from being his best novel. It is detached, almost passionless in its understatement, and much less moving than A Constant Gardener, which while technically not as perfect has an undercurrent of genuine passion and outrage, and characters that have more depth and humanity.<br /><br />It is more a return to the gray world of espionage, but without the looming menace that Cold War espionage lent to both fiction and reality. The main protagonist, Tommy Brue, is a British merchant banker who is basically as flat as the characters in the earlier and now largely forgotten Single & Single. While Le Carr&eacute; is clearly fascinated with the possibilities of a banker as hero, he has yet to find the right formula to make it work.<br /><br />Brue, 60, in his futile love for a young, attractive lawyer is more pathetic than anything else. It is difficult to relate to any of the other characters in what is virtually an ensemble cast, in the way that one could relate to George Smiley, as remote as his world was to most of us. Brue is a pale shadow even of Harry Pendel in The Tailor of Panama, also pathetic but a good deal more complex and interesting. Annabel, the lawyer, scarcely emerges as anything more than an old man's fantasy.<br /><br />For some reason, Le Carr&eacute; felt obliged to be discursive about espionage and terrorism in a couple of long set pieces couched as briefing presentations by characters, including one whose only role was to make a discursive presentation. Why, really, when his showing already conveys the message so much better? Is he afraid we don't get it. Yes, Gardener had some of that, too, but the reader was more willing to forgive it because of the evident sense of outrage.<br /><br />There is a hint of outrage here, but submerged in the ultimate sense of futility as all of the characters fatalistically play their roles in a scenario they know is doomed. There is little surprise in the denoument, either for the characters or the reader, though at least in the second half of the book the pace does carry you along easily enough.<br /><br />There is also little sense of Hamburg, though Le Carr&eacute; is clearly familiar with the city. But whereas he could convey a compelling sense of place when it is London or Berlin or even Bonn or Africa, there is no real sense of a specific location here. Perhaps Hamburg's charms are too subtle to figure in a drama of this type.<br /><br />Despite the impressive blurbs and the NYT Bestseller emblazoned the bland cover, I was totally unaware of this book's existence until I saw it in the bookstore. Perhaps Furst overpraised it in the hopes that Le Carr&eacute; would someday hype a book of his, though why Le Carr&eacute; would feel the need to do that is a mystery.<br /><br />One is reminded in these late Le Carr&eacute; novels of late Picasso, where the artist could make a fortune signing his name to pieces still better than what most other painters were producing but not possessed of the same vitality and originality as his earlier work.<br /><br />The author does succeed in transferring some of the moral ambiguity of his Cold War thrillers into the post-Cold War environment of the \\"war on terror.\\" But, again, it seems to lack the menace or urgency of that earlier setting.

B005MWJ106|3.0|In a sweeping history of mankind, starting maybe 1,000,000 BCE and ending in 2010 CE the author tries to explain, why the \\"West\\" is \\"ruling\\" today.   At the beginning, any racial reasons are ruled out by explaining the all of us (black or white or whatever..) have a very recent common ancestor. This is plausible.  The argument is based on some measure of social development, which includes energy consumption, organisatorial skills, war - skills, and maybe some more.  The book is well written, but too long! Even so broad a sweep should not need 622 pages of exceedingly small print -hard to read if you are not 25 any more.....  Also, one gets drowned in details, I recall the unending sequence of Chinese rulers....here I feel, less would have been more.  A completely different story is this measure of social development: Say, 4,000 BCE the measure differs by only 20% between East and West. As am engineer I question, whether such a quantity can be measured this accurately....BUT I am not a historian, so discount this comment!  Overall, this book offers an interesting point of view, IF you are willing to fight through 620 pages!

B005G4TJUC|4.0|A good part of the idea for this film is based on a novel of a similar title by Alan Dean Foster as well as the 80s TRANSFORMERS TV show. There are some interesting ideas in here that made it more intriguing than the last movie. There are also a number of known actors and actresses who showed up to play supporting or tiny roles (i.e. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong and the voice of Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime). In certain parts the story is good but in others it falls apart or has issues, especially when the love interest compels Megatron (come on, that isn't much of a spoiler if you watched the trailers or just know how these things work) and when Optimus Prime gets his second wind. I felt a tad ripped off with the Bee incident but I get a lot of kids are watching this and wanted it to go another way so I grudgingly understand. I did have some secret fun in yelling to my date \\"He's no McDreamy now!\\" but you have to have watched this movie and know GREY'S ANATOMY to get that reference. Megan Fox was said to have not been invited back by Bay after comparing his work methods to Adolf Hitler. Too bad because the new love interest got criticized even more than Fox. Shia LaBeouf said he would not do a fourth installment and some say that convinced Michael Bay to drop out of the franchise. Look for several Star Trek references. This film cost $195M to make and yielded over $1.1B at the box office. Several novels and a video game were spun off of this film. It had several nominations from the 2011 Teen Choice Award.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|this was such a good season that i had to order my brother a copy. As you might already know Andy W. has since passed away but has left us with a remarkable piece of art. storyline, acting and plenty of flesh. a Must have!!
B0034G4P80|4.0|As a fan i love marvel movies no matter how bad they are. but good Natalie Portman is in the first 10 seconds of the movie. How bad could it be. Actually a good story too.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Extremely pleased with this prequel. Andy will be missed, i can only hope that the new series is as intense and well crafted as this one. the addition of these characters from the past was brilliantly done. Gods of The Arena has become a ritual for me either as background or actually sitting down and watching the show. Dont miss out on a great six episode series.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I was hesitant to rent this movie because it only had two and a half stars here, but we gave it a shot. This movie was freaking hilarious.  My wife and I both loved it.  Then we read the reviews to try to figure out why it was only two and a half stars.  Some people are having some issues with the digital copy and therefore the actual movie rating is being affected.  This is my first review here and I just wanted to write it to give the ratings a boost because it deserves 5 stars.
0446613444|2.0|After being blown away with the introduction of cop detective Harry Bosch in The Black Echo, I just can't help but feel that the author is experiencing the \\"sophomore slump\\". The story in The Black Ice screams mediocre and it does the reader no good when the author writes at such a snail pace. There is literally nothing going action wise even when you're 3/4 into the book. The end does get a bit intense but by that time, you're probably too exhausted to care anymore about what happens and just wish the story would end. That is never good for any book when you just want it to end so bad. At the core, The Black Ice is another classic whodunnit mystery but something just felt missing here. It seems as if you don't care for the characters at all and that even at times apply to our main detective, Harry Bosch.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book but I'm not going to lie to myself. Although I don't hate it particularly, this book makes me not want to continue reading another Harry Bosch novel for a long time. While the story itself is pretty easy to follow, it just feels stagnant and again, I blame this toward the slow pace of the book. As for the characters, there's not much to go on here. If you've been introduced to Harry Bosch already, then you'll be glad to know that he's more or less the same person and that's a good thing. However, I would really hate it if the author continues to pit him together romantically with a new female character in every book. The author spends time reminding us of how meek and lonely his life is but with him getting to bed 2-3 women every book, I somehow don't believe that picture anymore. Obviously I want him to be happy but it's going to get pretty irritating if he's going to be one of those dude who can't help but be attracted to every victim's wife or girlfriend.<br /><br />With the book moving at such a slow pace, many a times I wondered if it would have been better if the author wrote in another characters point of view rather than just focusing on Bosch the entire book. I mean let's face it. Bosch is definitely a likable character but he's hardly the most exciting to read about. Reading The Black Ice felt just like Bosch getting hints and clues throughout the most part of the boook and then BAM! The author finally throws in the action sequences and the book ends. It also doesn't help the book that it has the typical cliche ending.<br /><br />All in all, I felt disappointed with reading The Black Ice. After coming off with such a great introductory book, this sophomore effort just fell short. It's not memorable in any way, had characters you didn't care about, sparse action sequences and a ending that was not worth all the reading you've done to get to that point. I definitely don't feel like this book was a page turner and can't really imagine how anyone could say that of this book. I'm sorry but unless you have a syndrome like me who have the need to read every book in a series chronologically, I definitely would advise you to skip this one and move on to the next. I doubt you'll be missing much.ng on Bosch the entire book. I mean let's face it. Bosch is definitely a likable character but he's hardly the most exciting to read about.

1439183392|3.0|I read this book by Don Winslow in September of 2011, and I've read his \\"Dawn Patrol.\\"  Overall they are entertaining. His character development is quite good, fleshing out details to help the reader understand characters visually and emotionally; what they look like, personalities and what drives them.  Of the two books, I preferred Dawn Patrol.  But, for me, I find the protagonist and his reality to be a bit tired now.  I don't think I'll be reading any more if there are other books released in this character series.  Late in the book it appeared that Boone was going to go in an interesting new direction, but he ended up essentially unchanged at the end.  Too bad; that new direction would have been much more interesting.
0307276902|3.0|I admit the only reason I read this book was because of the controversy surrounding it and the subsequent interview of the author James Frey on Oprah.  I  found it a little difficult to get into but after a couple of chapters i was drawn in and became interested in knowing more about the character and whether he would master his demons.  Although 427 pages, it is a quick read and many pages included dialogue with one word sentences such as:<br />Hello.<br />Hi.<br />How are you feeling today?<br />How do I look?<br />Fine.<br />So many of the pages are read quite rapidly.  The book did leave me wondering how/why it became an Oprah Book club selection. But to each his own I suppose.
B0001I561E|5.0|The video arrived wrapped in plastic and was just like new!  The discs didn't have any scratches on them, they were of excellent quality!
B004EPZ07U|3.0|Not the greatest movie of the summer but I still think Ryan Reynolds is a good actor, this was definitely more of a comic book movie, that played more to the loyal comic bookers rather than the crowd as a whole. That being said, I still enjoyed the movie.
0375842209|5.0|I have never before felt compelled to write a book review, though I've read many wonderful books.  And I have to confess that I didn't read the book, but listened to the audio version because I have a long commute to work.  It's rare that a book makes me forget I'm sitting in Boston traffic (if you live in Boston, you know what I mean).  It's even more rare when a book makes me talk back.  In listening to \\"The Book Thief,\\" I found myself saying, \\"well done,\\" as if I were talking to the author.    As a writer, I know how difficult it is to paint with words, yet the authors does so - and beautifully.  Liesel is a unique heroine that shows us the horror of Nazi Germany through a child's eyes.  A child who does not dwell in self pity, but finds a way to survive through books.  I used books in a similar way when I was a child, so felt much compassion for her.  But I also felt compassion for Rosa and \\"Death.\\"    My sincere admiration to this extremely talented writer.  I know mine is only one of more than one thousand excellent reviews, but I hope it reaches you (I have only a few dozen reviews for my own book, but every one means so much) -- or helps to convince someone else to buy this remarkable book.
B005HXGE9G|4.0|This won't be a detailed review-- there are plenty of those going around. I just want to point out a few flaws for those who might not be aware.  Flaw #1 - the track labled \\"A Quiet Moment\\" is not a new song as I had expected, but rather a 5 minute ditty of water and birds softly chirping. A big let down if you weren't expecting it.  Flaw #2 - The Nest That Sailed the Sky is an instrumental song, which begs to question why'd they put it on the instrumental bonus disc? It sounds like exactly the same version too. That's a real head scratcher. So many good songs on Ovo, and they include an instrumental song? Twice?  Flaw #3 - Not really a \\"flaw\\" since it can be remedied, but not including Signal to Noise on the regular edition was pure blasphemy in my opinion. S2N is bloody amazing. Luckily it is availible as a bonus track elsewhere.  Flaw #3.5 - Not including Washing of the Water on the regular edition. Luckily it can be found on the digital Book of Love single here on Amazon.  Flaw #4 - The biggest flaw in my book: Very little drums anywhere. This flaw is most evident on the opening track The Rhythm of the Heat. You know the song and you expect it to kick in at the end, but it doesn't. The symphonic thing sounds nice, but it doesn't bring out the songs full potential. Several songs suffer from the minimal percussion. Thank the lord they included some drums on Signal to Noise.   Aside from these minor details, New Bloood is an excellent addition to the PG catalogue. I, personally, wish he'd stop with this symphonic stuff and get to work completeing I/O, but knowing Peter, that could be another decade in the making, so I guess I'd better count my blessings while I can.
B004MOMT2M|5.0|For those of you with fairly serious systems and a universal player on the order of what I'm enjoying at this moment, an Ayre C-5XE, fronting the 5 series amp and preamp, feeding Focal Profile 918s via a cable loom consisting of nothing but Neutral Reference, this is why we want tons more hi-rez on disc, and certainly much more 24/192; the folks who produced this DVD-Audio genuinely cared about what they were doing, this is stunning! Not to be missed, highest possible recommendation -- for those who dig the music, which Lord knows is not everyone. It's just tragic they didn't go the whole way into 192. Can't comment on the Blu-ray, which is doubtless on a suitable system also wonderful, but this is just startlingly wonderful. The top is perfect, tons of liquidity, again, clearly created by people who care and listen, and not over dreck. This simply is not be missed. If you're riding any high quality universal player and listening to anything genuinely high-end, do not hesitate, have it rushed -- who can avoid that great a pun -- to you -- just fabulous. And Enjoy! All hail to Rush for caring enough about their fans to do this beautiful thing. If only other artists cared this much about their past work. And please, to any industry person reading this. 24/192 -- hello!
B0001I55OC|5.0|Great movie, interesting sci-fi elements. It follows the feeling of the book quite well, if not the story as closely. Paul Walker's character is not as brainless in this movie as usual even. it's one of those movies that gets in a hurry right away and doesn't let go.
0767811070|5.0|Does art imitate life or life imitate art? Boyz 'N The Hood is a classic American film directed by John Singleton. Singleton was 23 years old when this film was nominated for both Best Director and Original Screenplay during the 1991 Academy Awards. Singleton was the youngest person ever nominated for Best Director and the first African-American to be nominated for the award. The film has an outstanding cast known for breakout roles including: Cuba Gooding, Jr., Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, Laurence Fishburne, Nia Long, Tyra Ferrell, and Angela Bassett. Boyz 'N The Hood is an artistic expression and statement about life in modern America. The film follows three different friends and the serious trials and tribulations they must face throughout their lives. In one way or another every American can relate to this film. It is philosophical, violent, stylish, brutal, disturbing, and educational. Some say this film caused violence while others believe it brought the truth to light. The truth is either side could make a strong argument for their belief. The value of Boyz 'N The Hood is that there is an endless amount of possibility for critique.  This film exists and it is powerful and relevant. The main point is that Boyz 'N The Hood attempts to intelligently look at the much larger picture of what is happening in American society today. Boyz 'N The Hood can be accepted or it can be denied. It can be a lesson or it can be wrongfully emulated. It exists in the same way the truth exists:It should be known, understood, and valued. Watch this movie and think about the truth.

B000EXDS5M|5.0|Where do outlaw legends come from? Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an old time movie about a couple of old time bank robbers. This is a unique outlaw film with an interesting international spin. Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman), The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), and The infamous Hole in the Wall Gang make up a group of classic American outlaws. When a death warrant is placed on their heads they have no choice but to skip the country. Cassidy and the Sundance Kid move their bank robbing business to Bolivia and try to go straight. This effort lasts about 2 hours end ends in gun smoke. This is pretty much is the basis of the story: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are outlaws for life. It's all they know and all they can really do. This film is beautifully shot, written, and directed. This is a classic American movie that is full with style and equally heavy on substance. The humor is funny and the tragedy is upsetting. The action is also exciting and engaging right down to the very last shot. There is something here for everyone. It is most likely that anyone who takes the time to watch this movie will enjoy it. A must see.
0553386816|3.0|This is quite a departure for John Grisham and I imagine he enjoyed writing these short, snappy little stories as opposed to his normal, intricately plotted tales. After the first couple I was not all that impressed and I think the first was probably the least appealing of the seven in the book. Hence probably not the best note to start on.<br /><br />However, from the third onwards I found these short stories interesting and appealing. The casino tale particularly amused me as did the one about a conscience free lawyer getting his comeuppance. Having said that, these are, of necessity due to the length, rather lightweight and I would not describe them as being in the same league as most of Grisham's other work.<br /><br />So, to summarise, this is a collection which many will enjoy, but not one which will leave much of a lasting impression. I would add that I am a great fan of Grisham's work and would rate most of his output as Five Star.
1439192812|1.0|While science gives us reliable informatio­n, the scientific method is not the only avenue to truth. Actually, this method relies on logic and mathematic­s before it begins to tell us any truth. And it relies on certain moral truths such as \\"report all data honestly.\\" And one truth you can be sure of without ever using the scientific method is the content of your current thought.  Mr. Dawkins' philosophy of scientism informs his writing and conclusion­s rather than an examinatio­n of the evidence.   Also, his use of straw man arguments only further weakened his claims. Faith is holding onto something, found through reason, despite one's changing mood, i.e. an active trust. This is also the biblical definition and usage of the term, which Mr. Dawkins appears to be unaware of. Do some people hold beliefs without justified reasoning? Of course, in theism and in atheism, but to claim that all theists are guilty of blind faith misrepresents reality.

B005LJITS0|4.0|I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest Green Lantern fan, I've barely read any of the comics, and I wasn't really all that excited when I heard the original announcement for the movie, so I think I can claim I came into this movie with no real bias either way.  That said, I rented it content if it was simply a fairly cheesy \\"cash in on the comic book movie trend\\" flick that seems to be the rationale in the current economic market with so many studios playing it safe with remakes and comic book movies. I was even more skeptical with the horrible reviews it seemed to be getting, however, I'm glad I did end up renting it because I was pleasantly surprised I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, so much so to the point where I plan to buy a copy on blu-ray once it's out with all the extra goodies.  While I feel like it should be said, it's in no way perfect (nor on par with the Christopher Nolan Batman movies, Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy's, or even John Favreau's Ironman's), I think it's fair to characterize it as a serviceable effort that walks a line somewhere between trying to please hardcore fans of the comics and be entertaining for people who have no idea what's going on going into it.  I think for that reason, a lot of people will be a little indifferent towards instead of outright loving it but I will say I can understand the argument from some of the people who hated it.  There's a lot of continuity and story that's crammed into less than two hours and without any prior knowledge it's a little hard to follow at times, not to mention the way some of the material is lightly skimmed over (material that probably took months or possibly years to go through in the comics) to get the next bit of cannon in, it could definitely make it hard for some to really connect with the story or the characters.  Ryan Renolds does a decent enough job as Hal Jordan, but I really wish there weren't so many scenes where he fell into the offbeat goofy sarcastic tone thathe does in so many of his other straight up comedy movies.  At times when he took the character more seriously, he seemed like he almost fit the role but those times seemed a little too few and far between.  The rest of the cast wasn't terrible (other than Tim Robbins, I thought he did a lackluster job) but I did think Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond and Mark Strong as Sinestro were insanely well cast and both played their roles near perfectly.  One specific thing I saw a lot of people complaining about was the CGI but I thought it was pretty good for the most part, the full CG characters and scenes on Oa looked good to great, the suit effects and masks weren't the greatest but most of the action sequences looked like they fit right to that of the comics.  That said, I do recall there were a few scenes that kind of made me cringe by how cheesy they looked (particularly one where *small spoilers* Angela Basset's character is thrown face first into a glass window).  All in all, I thought this movie was a lot better than people have been giving it credit for, I just wish they would have taken a slower and more steady approach to flushing out all the plot points of the comics, or maybe just omitting some altogether, especially since they had already planned to make a second one before they even knew how this one would do.      Lastly, and this is something that didn't really have to do with the movie itself, but I was pretty disappointed when I rented the movie here on Amazon only to find out it was 480p, if I would have known this ahead of time I think I would have just waited until the local video store had it on blu-ray but this didn't really factor into my enjoyment of the movie.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I bought the Star Wars Lego Death Star set for my son's 10th birthday.  He just finished building the set and he he absolutly loves it!  He also very much enjoyed putting the set together.  The box is huge, and within the box are 4 smaller boxes and a very large master document of instrutions.  The price is high, but there is a moving elevator and other parts that work, which my son thinks is great.  I belive there is a true educational value to putting this set together and following so many directions.  There were a few missing pieces, and a few extra pieces of different types.  The Lego 800# for custmer service did re-order the missing pieces at no cost, you just have to wait at least a month to get the missing pieces replaced.  They are shipped from overseas.
B00004ZEQX|4.0|Wondering if this one is public domain since it's on a few other dvd box sets I have. This movie is fairly good. Lots of blood, gore, knives. I always laugh at the dubbing on these Italian films. It seems that the same voiceover actors were used to dub these 70's and 80's Italian horror films. If you like this genre, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It makes a nice addition to the collection.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Excellent.  Arrived right on the release date.  Price was perfect.  Have only watched 3 of the six movies but so far so good.  Could've done without the Lucas touch though.  Just leave em alone George!
B000XVSU9O|5.0|I read this book when my Mom was dying of Cancer. I also gave it to my 13 year old to read. After reading it she said that it really helped her and that it made her no longer fear death. She was with my mother when she died and her acceptance of Nanny's death helped all of us adults in the room with her. Embraced by the Light is a wonderful book that I have shared with many people over the years. I always have an extra copy on hand to lend to people who are going through a loved one's imminent death.

B005DZMODI|5.0|With 54 reviews already recorded and 31 of them in the 4 and 5 star category my opinion hardly seems needed or relevant.  Perhaps my age (nearly 60) is worth something besides a few aches and pains.  Having been an EC fan since his rave-up days with the Yardbirds, I suppose I can claim some listening expertise and opinion.  Frankly, I cannot add nor detract from most of what has already been said here save for a couple of comments.<br /><br />When I first read about this project, I thought \\"this might be interesting\\" though I completely misdiagnosed the product.  Having only minimal familiarity with Mr. Marsalis' accomplishments in the world of jazz, I presumed the music would have a modern or traditional jazz direction but I was sorely mistaken.  When I cued up a sample on Amazon after the album became available and I heard the familiar New Orleans' Preservation Hall sound, I knew immediately I would add this recording to my exhaustive library of EC's work.  I don't buy many CD's anymore because I now download most of my music (not bad for an old timer!) but since I already own just about everything ever laid down by Mr. Clapton, I wanted to keep my collection complete and up to date.<br /><br />The band backing Mrrs. Clapton and Marsalis is nothing short of extraordinary and polished.  They produce an orchestrated cacophony of layers of instruments - brass, clarinet, banjo, bass and percussion that is nothing short of genius.  These seemingly random notes are as well placed as the stroke of a master's paint brush to canvas creating a muscial masterpiece.<br /><br />I've always had a soft spot for New Orleans' jazz ever since I first heard the Dixieland Band at Disneyland as a young boy.  A couple of trips to the Big Easy and hearing the real deal only sealed my love and admiration for this style of music.  To now have my musical mentor produce an album like this is a great and satisfying joy.  I love this album and would love to witness this show live someday.  Enjoy.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is an album. Every song here is amazing, not just good. If you've listened to the past two albums like I did you'll notice how toned down the band's music has become. That is not to say that the music has lost its edge in any way, because the songs are still as face-ripping as ever, but the sound has been  very well refined so it will appeal to an even wider audience. Before I Forget was the song that changed my life forever. I thank Slipknot for this album. I kid you not, I could not be the person I am today were it not for this album.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Not just the night. It's hard for artist to keep up when their first two CD have been so great, but Lady Antebellum has done it again. Love that they write song based on their life experience, because they make you feel like they have written about your life. It's hard to pick a favorite song, but Dancin' Away With My Heart and Heart of the World are a couple of my favorites.
0316044695|5.0|This is simply one of the greatest books ever written by an American Hero or anybody else.  The stunning details, the near death, and death experiences are some of the most well thought out words I have ever read.  My mother, wife, grandmother, father, and grandfather all read this book in one sitting.  For anybody considering becoming a Navy SEAL this is a must read to determine if you have the heart and desire to become a SEAL and truly answer that question that every SEAL has faced and has learned to overcome.  SEAL's would rather die than give up.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|I happen to like 3D in the theater and at home, so I want to speak to that aspect of this film.<br /><br />Mr. Herzog saw the potential for 3D when he first visited the cave. He had to create his own, collapsible 3D equipment to fit through the hermetically sealed cave door, and it had to be manually adjusted for parallax depending on the distance to the image being filmed because access is via a walkway from which they could not stray. On the second visit they could use the knowledge from the first to gauge the length of extensions required to see images on the back side of pendant rocks and protrusions.<br /><br />The end result is a 3D feast. The cave painters used the 3D shape of the rocks in the cave to give depth to their paintings. In one case the face of a ox is on one face of a rock and the flank of the beast corresponds to a bulge in the side of that same rock, around the corner, much as if you were viewing the animal. While the film and the paintings can be appreciated in 2D, the true artistry of the ancient painters can really only be appreciated in 3D, and Mr. Herzog was right to endure the extra hardship of lugging the 3D camera through the cave.<br /><br />Bravo.
B0057GYOA4|2.0|Nirvana Nevermind 20th Anniversary 2-CD.    As soon as this arrived I tore open the box and popped them in my car stereo and went to run errands. Ugh. Even on the lowest volume setting in the car - the music blared.  Every song is just loud - there are no quiet sections within a song.  None of the songs have build up (think intro of Dire Straits Money for Nothing) - they start loud and end loud.  I never once reached for the volume knob to turn up a section.  Yes - the \\"speed-auto-vol-level\\" is disabled.    I know the original LP wasn't like this.  This is tiresome to listen to.  You can't hear the different instruments - the voices are lost, everything is just even. The sound is clean, nothing muddy etc.  Just loud loud.    Normally I buy the remasters hoping that the remixing is clean and newer technology improves (the new Beatles releases are awesome).      The music isn't fun to listen to.  Granted my car isn't a sound studio, but it is a pretty nice 250w 8 speaker system - and I love to crank the occasional tune. No cranking required with this CD. I'll play it on my home B&W 684's later and see if the Yamaha does it differently.  I doubt it - source is source.  Although the Yamaha can play at lot lower volume.    I wonder - is there an \\"unloudness\\" post-processing that we can all do during the ripping step?  I transfer everything to an old iPod and keep that in the car - then use FLAC on a streaming digital system for the home HiFi (actually CD -> FLAC -> mp3).  Wouldn't that be a cool iTunes plugin?    [...]

B005JLNALG|3.0|I have been waiting for this album since Road Salt One was released.  Originally when this project was annouced it was supposed to be a double album.  Things changed when POS had problems with their label and almost completely lost the project.  When Road Salt One came out I immediately fell in love with the album as it was hauntingly beautiful.  Granted it is a complete change of diretion for the band, I found it to be a really well done throw back to an Era of music that reminded me of going through my dad's vinyl collection years ago.    The anticiaption of Road Salt Two was huge for me, though I had a gut feeling that I wouldn't find it as interesting.  Unfortuneatly my gut feeling was right.  The album has its great moments and is well done, yet the sensation of something new and different is lost.  Had this  been released as a double album the impact would have been completely different and possibly the two albums would have flowed better together.   Musically not much has changed since Road Salt One.  The album has a darker feel to it, and has a slightly more progressive feel to it.  I think that They hit the \\"1970's on steroids on the head\\".  Daniel's voice is as great as always and I do enjoy the drumming on this album.  I do wish though that the album incorporated more of a collective effort from all of the band memebers as they are just as talented as Daniel is.  Break Darling break, Physics of Grindlock, Healing Now, and To the Shoreline are all terriffic songs that could be found in any of Pain of Salvations early releases.  This really is a well done album that shows creativity and professionalism.  As a Pain of Salvation fan, I enjoy the album, but it doesn't have the replay value of Road Salt One or their previous releases.  I am really excited to see where the band goes from here as they have already stated new material has been in the works since the Road Salt project was almost lost.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of POS, orto anyone who is looking for music that has great composition and arrangements and has patience to accept a change in diretion from earlier albums.  As I said, I do enjoy the album, however the impact on a split up double album has made it less appealing.
B0000A2I1B|5.0|this album has more of a miles davis influenced fusion sound than its predescessors. i believe that rolie and schon were still onboard on this one although rolie's vocals are more prominent i think on the first three santana releases. great guitar, keyboards, and the ever present latin percussion work,a vital ingredient in the santana-sound. a great listen when in chill-out mode.
0385534639|3.0|This book was a good read, but I imagined it would have darker undertones. There wasn't anything dark, disturbing, mind-bending, thrilling, or heartbreaking at all.  Not one page.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I guess (?), but I felt disappointed after hearing such high praise (although I'm not surprised Niffeneger said it was her favorite, her book was terrible) and hearing it being described as \\"dark\\" a million times.  It's about as dark as black cotton candy.  There wasn't enough romance for me to be invested in the characters who were supposed to be the lovers.  They were woefully undeveloped, I couldn't tell you much about either one of them if asked to give a description, except they were magicians playing a game.  Reading an entire novel and not knowing the main characters well is a shame.  However, the book was enchanting and interesting, even if the themes are juvenile.  I still liked this book, despite its shortcomings.  Everyone needs a light fun read once.  Consider it dessert.    PS- Morgenstern also loses points in my book for her pen name for creating it to match her book. So cheesy.  The movie will certainly be better.
B003L77G6A|5.0|it's perfect. La series esta muy buena, lastima que son pocos capitulos, solo 3 DVD's. El pedido llego en perfecto estado, y sobre todo en poco tiempo.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|this movie was AMAZING.. it was very beautiful.. a must see for romantics! It made me feel all \\"mushy\\" inside.
B005TPS0WG|2.0|See my other reviews on series 7 and you will get the picture about this series. It won't last long at this rate. No smooth transitions from one episode to another and jumps all over the place from one episode to the other. Simply stated the writers no longer have any continuity and seem to have run out of ideas. To much \\"What's wrong with you, and what'wrong with me\\" Keep the two Brothers, Bobby and CASIEL involved and the brothers working more together and not in conflict with each other. You have worn this idea out!
0553293397|4.0|Caves of Steel was much better. This one seemed blunted, flat compared to the first. But still a decent time burner.
B005VYGE64|1.0|This episode was not worth the money and not interesting and very boring. Bring back Casiel he makes the episodes much more interesting. What does Egypt have to do with these episodes. Have the writers run out of material? I think they are reaching to far in the past. We are not watching the Mummy or return of the Mummy! Stick more to the present. This episode was way to FAR fetched! Stick with God and Angels vs Evil more in the present. These episodes are not flowing smoothly from one to another as in the beginning episodes. If this continues, I will wait and watch the free reruns on TNT. I hope the writers get a little more imaginative and flow one episode into another with out reaching to far in the past.
B004L07KWQ|1.0|Can't do anything because the prompt to clear the screen keeps popping up. I'll give a better review when it gets fixed. I'll uninstall it if it doesn't get fixed soon.
B005R9PBK8|2.0|Not very interesting and does not flow smoothly from one episode to the other. Bring back Casiel, he kept the episodes more interesting to watch. The writers of these latest episodes are jumping all over the place. This ongoing series will not last much longer if number seven proceeds any further in this fashion.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|This is just another review ina sea of reviews, but I have to say I enjoyed this \\"season\\" of six episodes.<br /><br />I never read the comics. Genreally, I like zombie movies, but I suspect w hole series (I don't know how many seasons the producers intend to go, I hope this is a short series like GALACTCA: four seasons most, and short seasons by the way.) I think the producers knew that a zombie history line would run out of steem very soon, if they did not develop characters and kept the zombie to appear at specific plot points, not being the main \\"characters\\" of the show.<br /><br />I watched the six episodes at once, one after the other.

1419702203|5.0|This is a wonderful book and the best yet of the many Beatles/Harrison books I've read.  It is chuck full of never before published photo's from private family pictures. You get a much clearer picture of George Harrison as a man...his beliefs, his friends, his family and his view of life with and after the Beatles. I also recommend the HBO documentary this book was based on.  Like this book, it's fascinating and a delight.

B002ZG999U|1.0|I know I'm coming to this party a little late, but I can't leave it alone.  Last night, I finally saw The Expendables.  Part of me wanted to see this movie when it was released in theaters last year, but the bad reviews discouraged me.  Recently the film was made available on Netflix, so I thought I'd give it a tumble.<br /><br />It's not like I had high hopes.  Directed by Sylvester Stallone, the movie stars Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Steve Austin, Randy Couture, and of course, Stallone himself.  The film also features cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Hardly an ensemble cast of accomplished thespians, so I went into the film with especially low expectations.<br /><br />Somehow the The Expendables managed to exceed them.  There are simply no words to describe how bad this movie is.  I already mentioned the cast, but surprisingly, despite the presence of former UFC and WWE stars bringing down the curve, the acting really isn't the problem, or at least, not the most obvious.  The real problem is one of the worst scripts in the history of cinema.  It's written by David Callahan (?), whose most significant previous work is the screenplay for Doom. Watching this movie,  you'd think Stallone bought the story from the 3rd place finisher in a middle school writing contest for $20 and a signed copy of Tango and Cash.<br /><br />It's essentially a plot held together by a series of one-liners.  Bad ones.  Like, so bad you don't even understand them.  Now you might say, as defenders of the film do, the movie is a throwback, an homage to 80s action films that weren't very good themselves.<br /><br />Balderdash.<br /><br />Yes, many of those 80s movies that we love weren't all that great, but they at least had some style and panache.  Movies like Roadhouse and Commando are on the Mount Rushmore of over the top, 80s cinema excesses, but they were fun and unabashedly committed to style over substance.  Eighties action movies are legendary for their one-liners, but the story wasn't built around them.  Some were cheesy (\\"I feel the need, the need for speed!\\"), some were ridiculous (\\"Let off some steam Bennett!\\"), but they always made you smile (\\"I'm too old for this $#!%.\\").  And when they were delivered, there was no conceit, no inside joke, no shame.  Just perfect timing (\\"Yippee-ki-yay @#$%&!\\").<br /><br />Not so here.  Expendables isn't fun.  It's boring and incomprehensible.  From what I could figure out, Stallone and co. are a group of mercenaries who are hired by the CIA to kill a \\"rogue\\" agent who is taking over some small, nameless South American country in order to start his own drug trade.  But during a recon mission, he is captivated by young woman who refuses to leave when given the chance, choosing to stay and help her people.  Stallone decides he must go back to rescue her.  And of course, his fellow mercs (all four of them) sympathize and decide to join their friend in taking on an entire army by themselves for free.  Not surprisingly, they succeed (with no casualties).<br /><br />The action isn't bad; well choreographed and fast.  The violence quotient is pretty high with bones and joints being broken and bent the wrong way.  Bodies are shredded and blown apart by weapons fire.  But it comes at you so fast, it begins to blur together. None of the action is in the least bit compelling because you don't really believe any of the heroes are in danger, or care enough about them if they were.<br /><br />As far as the characters, the only thing that differentiates them is how they prefer to kill people.  Stallone's the crack shot.  Statham is the knife guy.  Jet Li's the martial arts expert.  Crews is the heavy weapons guy and so on.  The acting, like I said before, is about what you'd expect given the screenplay they had to work with, but one guy stands out below the rest.  I don't remember Dolph Lundgren being a particularly bad actor, but his \\"performance\\" makes you think adrunk wandered onto the movie set, stumbling and slurring his way around, demanding that he be given a part.  I seriously couldn't understand a word he said.<br /><br />It's too bad.  With its cast, the film had the potential to be a lot of fun.  Stallone has shown he can direct halfway decent films.  His last two outings, Rocky Balboa and Rambo were actually kind of compelling.  The Expendables, in contrast, is dull, humorless, and I found myself checking my watch hoping it would end soon.  The worst part, however, is that no one, not my friends, not my family told me how bad this movie is.  Shame on them.nding that he be given a part.  I seriously couldn't understand a word he said.

1419701533|5.0|Our 8 year old daughter got one of the books earlier in the year and I noticed her interest in reading more. Once the box arrived she was very happy and couldn't wait to read them all. This may not be the most ideal literature - it is however in my opinion significantly better to see kids read than having them waste away in front of mindless TV.
1594744769|2.0|Looks can be deceiving<br /><br />Who hasn't seen this creepy book, lurking proudly in the \\"New Releases\\" section?  It practically SCREAMS Halloween--a nice, delightful scare that makes you lock your doors tighter, leave on the nightlight, and snuggle deeply under your covers.<br /><br />Only...it doesn't.<br /><br />WARNING: I've tried to make this review as spoiler-free as possible, but I may have missed a few.  Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Sure, the girl looks REALLY creepy on the cover and many of the back images are enough to give you the eebie jeebies, but NOTHING that remotely scary EVER occurs within these pages.  Okay, maybe the very first scene, where Jacob sees the Thing for the first time, can count.  But I am not the most stalwart of persons.  I turn away at blood and gore in movies, my stomach churns when I read about gobbets of flesh, and I was scared of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow guy until about two years ago.  So when I say that I had no troubles reading this at 11:30 at night and then going to sleep peacefully, you know this isn't that scary.<br /><br />And that is only one of the many failures of this potentially awesome book.  This book promises to do something rarely seen in fiction: combine pictures with a story.  But there it fails yet again.  The pictures are awkwardly inserted into the story, usually surrounded by text along the lines of: \\"And X showed Y a picture of a girl PICTURE HERE\\".  Not what I would call the most \\"seamless\\" of storytelling.<br /><br />And let's talk about characters, or what passes for characters in this book, starting with our protagonist and viewpoint character, Jacob.  I don't think I've met a character as unlikeable as Jacob in a very long time.  He's a selfish, whiny, obnoxious, pretentious, arrogant little brat!  And it's really sad, because in the Prologue, I actually liked him; but once I got to the first chapter where he admits to trying to get fired, I hated him.  We have 14 million Americans without jobs--these are men and women with families, who would take ANY job they could get their hands on just to put food on the table--and here this joker misbehaves at work, treating his boss with disrespect, and gets away with it because his uncles own the store.  Other than he doesn't want to be in the \\"family business\\", why does he act this way?  I have no clue.  Jacob is hardly relatable; his parents are obscenely (and conveniently) wealthy, making it easy for Jacob to go to Wales.  Jacob is constantly acting like a diva, complaining about all the wealth he has, while revelling in what it can get him access to.  He drops words like \\"Sisyphean\\" but never comes across like the type of kid who would do that (such as Anne Shirley).  In fact, Jacob is said to be super smart, but other than the author writing \\"X is smart\\", Jacob never feels smart.<br /><br />But poor Jacob, he doesn't have any friends!  Well, maybe it's because his abrasive, self-righteous, priveleged personality chases them away.  His mommy and daddy don't listen to him!  Well, maybe it's because a traumatic incident happened, and they are dealing with their own grief.  Or maybe it's because they are too busy at work, trying to make enough money to send him to Wales.<br /><br />So what could have been a strong character (like Quentin from John Green's \\"Paper Towns\\") comes off like a 5 year old who hasn't realized that the world doesn't revolve around him.<br /><br />Other characters are so flat, it's pathetic.  The parents are cold and impersonal, all the better for Jacob to \\"run away\\" to his fantasy friends (which, by the way, I predicted would happen at about the 130 page mark).  Every one of the \\"peculiar children\\" has only one note to play and has no background, nothing to make them remarkable (not to mention that their introduction is rather sloppily tied into the pictures from which they are based).  And thinking about these \\"children\\": isn't it odd that they look and act like children?  Shouldn't we see something more along the lines of Kirsten Dunst's character in the movie, \\"Interview with a Vampire\\"--an adult stuck in a child's body?  In fact, why are these \\"children\\" able to experience the passage of time at all, but the town around them recreates the same day over and over again?  If it was explained in the book, I didn't catch it.<br /><br />About the only one that does stand out is Emma, because she is Designated Love InterestTM.  Which is disgusting, as 70 years ago, she was canoodling Jacob's grandfather.  God, why does every young adult novel nowadays require a romance?  I was really hoping with this book that we wouldn't have a romance; with a guy as the author, I thought he would focus more on the adventure.  But no, we have to have a romantic couple in here, because we have to do something to draw in the preteen and teen Twilight crowd.  I mean, it's not like there are girls out there who like Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, and stuff for more than just the sexy times.  I guess if A) Jacob had been likeable, B) Emma had been likeable and not been his grandfather's age, and C) the romance had been well-done and not rushed I would have liked it, but alas, it was D) none of the above.<br /><br />And what is it with all these guys being attracted to ice cold women pointing knives into their bellies?  Do I need to read more Freud or something?<br /><br />So for story...*snickers*  Well, the beginning was pretty interesting, with Jacob discovering his grandfather's past.  But after finding Miss Peregrine's Home, it just disappears into Sexy Times with Teenaged Looking 80-Year Olds until the author realized he could include another plot and extend the book another 100 pages.  And then, as if this book didn't p!ss me off enough, the book ends on basically a cliffhanger prepping for a sequel.  A SEQUEL!  This book didn't deserve a full novel, much less a SEQUEL!<br /><br />And let me get yet another pet peeve out of the way: World War II?  Really?  Jacob is 16; his grandfather was a teenager in WWII?  Not that this isn't possible, but we do realize that children that are 16 right now can have grandparents born in the 40's and 50's (or even 60's and 70's) right?  What is our obsession with WWII?  If something bad happens, drag in the Nazis?  Or is it the fact that no one wants to touch the highly controversial Vietnam War?  To try to give an idea of what I am saying: I'm almost 28, and my grandparents were in their late teens or childhood during the war.  If my grandparents were the appropriate age to join the war, I would think that Jacob, who is 16 (if this story takes place in 2011, of course), would have even younger grandparents than mine.<br /><br />I am guessing the biggest reason this book is doing well is John Green's bold endorsement on the back: \\"A tense, moving, and wondrously strange first novel.  The photographs and text work together brilliantly to create an unforgettable story.\\"  Besides the fact that for the first 50 horrible pages, in which the book tries and fails to be the next John Green novel, this book is about as far from \\"tense, moving, and wondrously strange\\" as it could get.  As for the \\"photographs and text work[ing] together\\", no way, not at all.<br /><br />The sad thing is, the Prologue was absolutely amazing.  It DID have that creepy portent that the cover promised.  It DID have interesting characters--the grandfather and Jacob (who hadn't jumped head first off the Likeable Cliff yet).  But all that was wasted in a lack of plot, a horrible protagonist (whom I wanted to smack some sense into), boring characters, the pictures ginnick, and trying too hard to be quirky and funny like a contemporary John Green novel.  Very disappointing and not recommended.  I will NOT be checking out any sequels to this series.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

1932100660|3.0|I read the book a few years ago.  I tried the diet for a month.  I ate peanuts and beans to get my protein. I made pizza using soybean cheese.  The pizza was delicious.    I started getting abdominal pains after 3 weeks. They got more severe.  I started having trouble walking at work long distances.  I researched my symptoms and found that gluten people can be allergic to soybeans.  I also found that abdominal pain, cramps and weakness are a symptom of protein deficiency.  I ordered a steak and cheese sub at the company cafeteria. I felt much better by the end of the day, but I had to throw out all the soybean cheese pizza too.  I guess as individuals we all have different protein needs .  I will try it again,but will consume an egg daily to supply protein.

0446547654|2.0|I have always had a soft spot for Nicholas Sparks books. They're simple, fun, and easy-to-read books. They are not literary masterworks, they are just a short, light piece of fluff you can read in a couple of days. And usually, Nicholas Sparks can tell a good love story. Not here. I hate to say it, but \\"The Best of Me\\" is like one of the groan-worthy movies you see on the Lifetime Movie Network. Get a simple but cheesy love story, throw in a few violent scenes, some explanations of why 99% of men are just jerks who abuse women and want to fight, and that's this book. Unlike his other novels, Sparks seems to be rehashing a lot of ideas from other books. I could have sworn I was reading the Notebook for at least a few chapters while reading this one. Also, Sparks likes to throw in little \\"cute\\" talks about fate and destiny (in one chapter there's talk of one of the main characters finding a four-leaf clover on a porch; aww, so cute!) and it really doesn't work as well as he probably thinks it does.  I am being really harsh, I know, but this book was a complete bore. My heart will always have room for The Notebook, A Bend in the Road, The Lucky One, and The Choice. But not The Best of Me.
0307595579|5.0|These stories are amazing!!!  It's such a shame that the author is dead because I would love to read more of his work.  After you read the books, you should definitely watch the movies.  The Swedish movies are dubbed in English or subtitled.  Plus, American versions are coming soon.

B005UBNKZG|5.0|The Title is Wrong, this CPU is Socket AM3+....  For Price/Performance this 8-Core CPU is a winner.   AMD FX 8120 (Code Name Bulldozer) will give you high performance in highly threaded Applications and Benchmarks with Newer Code. It currently stands it's ground, but it will be difficult to make all those cores work for you with todays lacking software.  AMD really went far out with this style of design and put a lot of time and pure Innovation into it. For that alone they get 5***** from me.  The cool part about this 8-Core Monster is the fact you can turn cores and threads on and off at will via Bios and AMD's FX software. This is a Black Edition which means you can also Overclock the CPU in a safe manner by means of a built in technique called Turbo Core.  You can use Turbo Core to increase clock speeds when needed and/or you can manually Overclock it through the Bios and/or AMD's FX software. You can run this as 4 cores with 4 threads, 2 cores with 4 threads, 8 cores with 8 threads and so on.    Overall it's a great CPU. It's not without it's issues though. Because it's brand new, built from the ground up and completley different from what anybody has ever done, Software Developers need to catch up to AMD's style of design. Once they do in the near future, this processor should further guarantee you a solid future proof setup.  That said, it's been reported that the new AMD FX CPU's suffer from scheduling problems due to Microsoft's current Windows 7 OS not utilizing the AMD CPU properly. Windows 8 resolved this issue and the newer OS understands how AMD's new 8-Core works gaining you maximum performance. Hopefully Microsoft will release a patch for Windows 7 to resolve this issue.  Despite some Negative reviews along with some Positive reviews, here is my take on the matter.  - AMD needs to further tweak this design.  - Software needs to polish up to take advantage of this new design.  - Driver Updates.  - Windows 7 Update for Bulldozer to ensure further performance and consistency.  AMD's Innovation = Intel's Success. Without the two, the CPU Industry would fall far behind in Innovation and Technology.   Good Job AMD, just fix the Quirks. Thanks...
B004L07KWQ|3.0|Thanks for the free app! I like that you can select photos as a canvas for the drawing. I wish you could queue up photos- he gets impatient to select another.  I like that you can hit the backspace to undo a line. I don't like that too many backspaces clear the selected photos.  Also, there should be an option to disable the buttons so the app doesn't exit. The drawing itself is not multitouch. It doesn't change shape with speed.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|I've been a fan of Evanescence from the start, but I have to say that lately I haven't been real sure about their future or how well they would evolve - until now!  Wow! What a truly solid album from them and the more I play it, the more I like it!  There seems to be so much more positive emotion and energy in Amy's voice this time and all the songs are all very catchy and layered with sound.  It definitely rocks harder than the open door.  Fallen of course will always be their 1st and a favorite of mine, but I personally think I like this album even better! For fans of this type of music, I would also like to highly recommend Nightwish (a symphonic metal band from Finland) and their album Dark Passion Play. Imaginaerum from Nightwish is also comming soon!

B004RKXHZY|5.0|After finishing Anna & the French Kiss, I dove right into Perkins' next novel. It was a fantastic story that kept me hooked until the end, and I read it in a single day. At first, I wasn't sure I would be able to connect with Lola the way I had with Anna, simply because Lola is just not me. She is wacky and funny and dresses in costume everyday, but page after page I fell in love with her character as well. Lola and the Boy Next Door is the story of a teenage girl struggling to decide who she really is on several different levels. She is trying to distance herself from her genetic identity found in her birth parents as well as figuring out what love really is.<br /><br />The characters here have true depth and feeling behind them, and it is easy to feel as if you are really part of their world while reading, which I love about Perkins' writing. Each character is lovable and memorable and will draw you into the story. Do not miss this book or write it off as another YA girl-likes-boy book. It is so much more than that! Each page had me laughing out loud, and it was one of the best books I've ever read.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is delightful!
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Read back of blu-ray at the store to see if this Green Lantern digital copy was compatible with my Apple products (my system meets the stated \\"Mac requirements\\".) WRONG! I expected an actual digital copy disc and that is what it said on the top of the packaging. WRONG again! I purchased the blu-ray with digital copy only to find that it did not work on any Apple product as stated on the back. I, too thought that the Ultraviolet download meant the movie as many other people thought. Poor wording on Warner's part on packaging on both counts. Not being familiar with ultraviolet/flixster, I tried to download the digital copy and it would not download. Then, I had to read online comments to find, after purchasing this product, that it did not work! I called the store and returned this blu-ray for my money back, because of false advertising from Warner Brothers and shared with the store that they were selling a product that was falsely advertised. They have had numerous complaints and returns. Downloading a digital copy just shouldn't be this difficult!!! Warner Brothers -  why make everyone go through two extra hoops -  ultarvailoet/flixster sign ins - just to get a digital copy that I understand is poor in quality anyway!?! You are just contributing to illegal downloads with your false advertising. Warner Brothers lost this sale and will lose all other future purchases until they make their digital copies available to ALL!
0300169787|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! You get a lot of bang for your buck. Looking at this book in person, it look like it would cost well over $50.00. If you have not purchased this book yet, all I have to say is GET IT NOW!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Purchased 2 of these mics for an interview done in a noisy factory.  I'm on a budget and my camera doesn't actually have a mic in port.  So both mics were wired into voice recorders and kept on the subject and interviewer (audio was synced in later with the video).  This allowed the interviewer and subject to roam freely around the factory.  The cords were long and had to be tucked into their pockets, but the quality and the freedom of movement more than made up for it.  These mics can be powerful so I suggest setting any voice recorders used to only \\"dictation\\" mode, otherwise you might get higher than intended voice levels.  The mics are mono, so with some devices, it may only record to the left channel.  One of my dictation units actually recorded to both channels, the other only recorded to the left channel.  You have two choices at that point, either get a stereo (male) to mono (female) adapter (couple of bucks), or use an audio editing program (I used audio cleaning lab from Magix) to copy and paste the left channel into the right channel.  These are great, inexpensive lapel mics.  More than worth the money.
1573226521|5.0|The Beach by Alex Garland is nothing short of fantastic. It is definitely not my favorite book of all time but that is the only criticism I can give it, if that even counts as criticism. Seeing the movie is what got me interested in the novel and while I did enjoy the movie a lot, the book has far more depth and emotion than the movie. It is a book in which not a lot really happens, at least to a fan of hardcore horror, but this shows me that books don't need to be action-packed to be good. This one is uniquely written and doesn't always show you the good and evil or if the narrater is losing his mind gradually through-out the book or not. I don't want to give the wrong impression though because things do happen, but if you have seen the film, the movie is much darker in my opinion, at least until the final showdown which is one of the most brutal and horrifying things I've ever read. In short, I would say that the film is more of a thriller and this book is on the boundary of thriller and just general fiction but again, that is just my take on it. I strongly suggest you read it if you like to stray towards the darker side of fiction.
1439153663|5.0|This was a wonderful read, not only because of its historical context, set in late eighteenth century colonial America (a period I find fascinating), but also because of its compassionate exposure of the cruelty people of color, and women without say, experienced before emancipation of blacks and women.<br /><br />The characters are all well drawn: the slaves are especially remarkable for their loyalty and love that surpasses prejudice; they work together to help one another; their family included the white indentured servant who is thrust into their lives and eventually becomes their mistress.<br /><br />I finished the story, a little jealous but filled with admiration for the author, wishing my own historical fiction novel, [[ASIN:B005I585ZE Unexpected Journey]], might be half as good (and deservedly well-received) as this book, a story that gives insight and perhaps helps heal deeply ingrained societal wounds by revealing the complexity of human relationships, and the need for equality, empowerment, and inclusion for all people.
0451528018|4.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles is a book that I really can't criticize at all with any real power behind it. I really enjoyed this book. I started out with several short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes, found them fascinating, and read this. I wasn't disappointed. The book is rather short so it kind of still keeps that short story feel. It also has the horrid skill of making the reader almost sick with the unknown. When I read this, I wanted it to end more than most other books I've read just to find out what was going on. Also, as a horror fan, I can definitely say that this book has horror elements in it. Some scenes are damn creepy and all scenes are completely necessary with no slow or dull moments to let you lose that building tention. Brilliantly told and a book that is a classic to me. And, in the end, there is always an explanation to satisfy the reader and this is a good one indeed.
0060558121|3.0|WARNING: SPOILERS!<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's work has always left me feeling ambivalent. He's certainly not a bad writer, but I feel his strength is his imaginative setting and quirky characters, while his weak point is plot. I loved the imagination of Neverwhere and MirrorMask; I hated their banal, done-a-thousand-times-before plots. Sadly, with American Gods,  it isn't only the plot that's the problem; it's everything else, as well.<br /><br />In defense of Gaiman: I won't be one of those people who give the book one star because they thought \\"Shadow\\" was a stupid name or because Gaiman isn't American and doesn't/can't know America well enough to write about the American soul. I say bull. So the character is named Shadow - so what? People give their kids weird names. Keith Richards named his kid \\"Dandelion\\", and who can forget \\"Apple\\"? And if Gaiman's being British automatically marks him as incapable of writing a great American novel, then you might just as well delete all those other books written by immigrants from your greatness lists - Ayn Rand, Mario Puzo, Vladimir Nabokov, and a ton others who are now known as great American writers despite having not been born in America.<br /><br />There are a lot more reasons than that to give this book a low rating. The plot is meandering and dull. The characters are flat and incredibly unsympathetic. The setting is depressing. The events leading up to the climax are implausible and inconsequential, and the climax itself... Well, to be honest, there is none. The book builds you up in anticipation of this great culmination of the story, then just as it's about to unfold, it goes, \\"on second thought... nah.\\"<br /><br />Shadow is an interesting (albeit not entirely plausible) character up until page 70 or so. Fist we're told he's served 3 years in prison for assault and bank robbery, yet his quiet, brooding manner is the complete opposite of someone who'd even consider robbing a bank. During the course of the book, he shows strong, definite emotion exactly once: he sobs for his dead wife on page 66. After that, you get absolutely nothing. No emotion, no surprise, no curiosity, nothing. His dead wife shows up - no reaction. A raven talks to him - no reaction. A dead leprechaun comes back to life - no reaction. He sees people who don't appear human - no reaction. He doesn't care about anything. He doesn't even care if he lives or dies, and if Shadow doesn't care, how can we? I couldn't identify or sympathize with anyone in this book. Wednesday is a scheming, womanizing jerk. Laura, Shadow's wife, is a slut who cheated on Shadow with his best friend while Shadow was in prison. All the other gods are either whiny, pathetic, bitter old people, or obnoxious, ugly young people. The premise is that gods only exist because we believe in them, and the less we believe in them, the weaker they get. 80% or so of Americans believe in the Christian God - that's a pretty big number, and yet it's completely ignored. It makes no sense.<br /><br />But the worst offender in this book, I feel, is the horrendous editing. I'm no writer, but even as a hobbyist I know the basic rules of good writing: things like showing instead of telling, resisting the urge to explain, cutting out things that don't advance the plot. Gaiman breaks all of those rules. He even breaks the basic grammatical rules of writing, such as using active voice whenever possible, and sticking to one tense. On page 336, we read: \\"'She doesn't want to know,' compained Mama Zouzou to Clementine\\". The very next paragraph reads: \\"Then do not teach her,\\" says Clementine\\". Wait... WHAT? Is the use of two different tenses in the same scene something the editor missed, or is it meant to be there? Either way it's unforgivable. The book is choke-full with stuff like that. We get pearls like \\"a small woman walked in through the door\\" (well, DUH), and \\"a car door was opened for him\\", and \\"he felt like crap, in every way he could feel like crap\\" (how lazy... wouldn't it be better to SHOW us, by writing something like \\"Shadow punched the wall and felt tears searing the back of his throat\\"?). This is innovative and groundbreaking? Please. It's not. It's bad writing. It's jarring, cringe-worthy, and stupid. And do we really need to know what Shadow had for lunch or when Shadow took a piss or how Shadow went clothes shopping? Do we really need a graphic description of homosexual fellatio, especially when it does absolutely nothing for plot advancement or character development? It's just fodder to fill the pages. This book often reads like a first draft. A bad one.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars, because it isn't a bad book per se, and it did entertain me on a certain level. There are flashes of brilliance here, and memorable imagery (the dream of thunderbirds, the judging by Anubis, and even the cozy but dull small town America). I thought the Lakeside subplot was well done and provided and unexpected twist. And I actually enjoyed the mini-stories \\"Coming to America\\", even though I admit they did nothing to advance the plot. But then there are other parts, parts that are just plain painful to read. This was one of the most frustrating reading experiences I've ever had. It took me good 5 months to finish it. Great premise, poorly realized. Fire your editor, Neil. \\"American Gods\\" doesn't deserve one star, but neither does it deserve a Hugo.zy... wouldn't it be better to SHOW us, by writing something like \\"Shadow punched the wall and felt tears searing the back of his throat\\"?).

B005GIS23I|1.0|Fun sci-fi movies are few and far between (nothing in recent years has really matched up to Men in Black or Galaxy Quest). My wife and I decided to give this one a shot since it had reasonably good reviews. The humor was pretty crude and juvenile, which is rather too bad since I wouldn't let my young children watch a rate \\"R\\" movie anyway. So, to the directors of \\"Paul\\", I'd recommend choosing your niche genre a little better. If you're going for the adult crowd then how about something that's at least remotely intellectually stimulating and funny at the same time. Otherwise, cut the crude language so my kids can watch it.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This is a fabulous album with such great music from such talented artists. You can't go wrong with this one!
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I had heard, and was impressed by a few Evanescence tracks before buying this album. It was not an immediate hit with me but after listening to it 10 times I'm getting in to it. I will be buying more of their music. Amy Lee has such an amazing voice.
0060775858|5.0|Good pictures, good rhymes, mellow tone -- works as a great goodnight book. It's one of our kids' favorite book ... they said \\"moon\\" as one of their first words when pointing to the book. Most of the words are easy for them to say, and there are a lot of colors inside that they can point out as well. You won't go wrong purchasing this book.
B003KYMCY0|4.0|This is classic Foreigner. Kelly Hansen sounds just like Lou Gramm. It's not their best album but it is definitely worth adding to your collection if, like me, you like Foreigner.
B000NA28I4|2.0|It was a really bad movie. I read the books, and they were really good. The movie completely destroyed the story. I expected it to be much better. They left out lots of important parts of the book out. The characters were nothing like they described in the book. The 103 minutes they used were NOT WELL USED. They spent to much time on certain parts of the movie. Definitely read the books first. The special effects were the best part. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of the special effects. Saphira and the Shade were definitely the best characters. Eragon and Roran looked too much alike! They also revealed things too early and changed the entire story. They didn't explain many things that were explained in the book, making it confusing for people who haven't read the book. My friend was reading the book, but after watching the movie she didn't want to keep reading because she was afraid the book would be too much like the movie. IT'S NOT!!!!!!!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Having read 'Pillars of the Earth' and it's sequel 'World without End' I was keen to read this book. I was not disappointed, it is evey bit as good as the other two and like them, difficult to put down once you get into the story.
B003L77GRO|4.0|The series wrote itself into a tiny corner in season 4 and yet found a entertaining way to wiggle out and provide 12 more episodes.  I miss seeing Dexter's wife but happy that the struggle between murder and protection continue.
B0000009S3|1.0|This CD is made in Argentina and looks like a pirate copy with a poor finish picture disc, and the green jewel case is too green that looks very fake, not like the original Rykodisc, and the inlay image looks a little bit blur like a bad copy. I'm very disappointed. This CD becomes the worst thing in my complete Zappa collection. Next time I will try with Japanese edition they make the best editions with an optimum quality and never fail. But The music still great, one of the best Zappa albums. this critic is about the edition.
0470876417|5.0|I just got impressed of how useful this book was for my company. It even become part of our core competence advantages. I really recommend it for anyone who want to get some really impressive tools for business analysis and innovation.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I tremendously enjoy Spark's books so I wish I had not added this one to my collection to taint the mix. I considered giving this a single star but out of respect for the obviously talented author and the character development of Dawson & Amanda, I begrudgingly gave it two. I have read this book before. The characters have had different names and are set in different times and places and were written by different authors but this story line was hardly original which is unfortunate because the two main characters, along with Tuck were believable for the most part. I agree with another reviewer that Dawson's perpetual fidelity was poignant but unrealistic; reminds me of a sad country song. Shades of John Tyree's touching altruism were revisited (Dear John) but to a much more painful degree which left me wanting something entirely different from the way the last half of the story was written. I was  a bit aggravated when I suspected where the story was headed and skipped ahead to confirm my suspicions which is something I rarely do. Incidentally, I hope future offerings from Sparks will avoid the magical, mysterious, paranormal characters that have been lurking in the periphery of some of his more recent books. I find them a little contrived and distracting. I do appreciate that Mr. Spark's books are character driven and that his stories focus on human emotions rather than dragging the readers through a mire of profanity and meaningless copulation that so many of this genre fall to. I am looking forward to his next book but this one just didn't do it for me.

Apple will tell you that the best thing for you devices is NOTHING and after several phones that I had put protective products on, all which eventually peeled, looked uglyg, etc.......I have done nothing with my iPHONE 4 for a year and it still looks like new.  The glass has never scratched and looks great!  They're built so well.  Forget these products!
1609410416|3.0|While it's a good book, the second disc abruptly skips from Chapter 20 to Chapter 21. I know it's not my cd player as other discs play just fine. Beware of glitch. I ordered a replacement one and the same thing happened on disc 2. It jumps from the middle of Chapter 20 to 21 abruptly. There may be a defect in the original manufacturer copy which then could lead to subsequent copies having problems.
B000NL2ILA|5.0|great set of movies and for the price u can't go wrong worth ever cent!My kid had never seen the movie so we got all three and she thought they where great.
0316044695|5.0|Great book!  A riveting account of an incredible battle.  I read it in less than 7 hours; couldn't put it away.  This book should be required reading for at every high school and college in the country so that our children can have a better appreciation of the sacrifices these brave souls make so that we can enjoy our freedom! Hooyah to all the personnel of our armed services!
B00466HN86|1.0|I have not seen this movie yet.  I'm hard of hearing,I watch movies that has closed captions, this does not.  I've heard this is a very good movie and recommended everyone to watch it.  Since this does not have closed captions I won't be able to watch it......Hope everyone will watch it and enjoy it.

0670022950|1.0|Some editor, Pinker being famous for being famous, was SURE that ANYTHING by Pinker would sell. This book is anything.  LITERALLY it is someone writing about something they know ABSOLUTELY nothing about.  You could not get worse ideas on this topic by reading ANY other book. Pinker is old enough and rich enough and lazy enough that he will put his name to ANYTHING AT ALL---this book is the proof.  NOTHING in this book is professional, is researched, is validated with data, is true, is not biased, is not just lovely coherent fictions put together because with Pinker's name behind them they will sell. This is PURE book-for-sucking-money-from-suckers.  It is a waste of my time to review it.

B0001HAISG|4.0|Wow ! I was really impressed with this movie.  I think the acting was fantastic. I really loved the lost boys, because they were so well played. I thought Tinkerbell was wonderful! She had great facial expressions ! Neverland was really beautiful and happy until Peter and Wendy got mad at each other. The scenes were a little awkward and it didn't make sense how 10 kids could be fighting like, 30 pirates. I mean , it just looks a little strange. I adore Wendy ! She is soooooo pretty. Peter (Jeremy Sumter) and Wendy seem to work together really well. It's nice seeing them attracted to each other so much. Over all, this movie is amazing and the sellers on Amazon have always send things to me quickly making this DVD a no-brainer to buy. I would suggest this movie. P.S. There may be one part you would want to skip.

B005MW654Q|5.0|I've purchased the last couple of Mastodon CD's and they were pretty good but honestly there was just a little bit too experimentation going on for my taste. I really, really liked pieces and parts of songs on the previous recordings but it was tough sometimes sifting through a song to find the real gems that make me love this band. I decided to go ahead and pick up this CD and although I'm sure purists of Mastodon and this genre will disagree but I think it's their best work.  I like the fact that the band is working in managable song sizes and it's not an exercise in metal exploration. Some bands can spiral like that but this recording proves to me that Mastodon is at its best when it's confined somewhat. It's taking the long, spun-out ravings of a lunatic and distilling it into highly-concentrated genius.   I'm ok saying that I love the song \\"Curl of te Burl\\". It's very catchy, melodic, and very interesting. \\"Octopus Has No Friends\\" is a fan favorite as well. Again, it's taking the brilliance of an 11 minute Mastodon Epic and crunching it down into < 4 very tasty minutes. In all though, I recommend this album to existing Mastodon fans and for folks who have read their critical acclaim and want to give them a test-drive. If you like this CD, start working your way backward through the catalog. If you don't like this, you can say that you gave it a spin and move along to other stuff.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|It's been over a year since Memphis Blues was released and this cd shows that she still has the range she did 30 years ago.  She still has the energy and looks so great as well.  Just Your Fool is a cute song and she sings it with just like that.  Shattered Dreams is a great song and she hits all the right notes perfrctly.  Early in the Morning is another cute and silly blues song and she delivers.  Romance in the Dark is phenominal and she is everything a great singer should be.  How Blue Can You Get? is another great song and she gets down on it once again.  Down Don't Bother Me She starts out slow and goes full range.  Don't Cry No More is perfection a song like she would have done with Blue Angel.  Rollin' and Tumblin is very bluesy indeed as well is Down so Low. She really blows me away with Mother Earth and the album ends with Crossroads.  She hits the hight notes with style and grace.  I only wish Wild Women Don't Sing the Blues, I Don't Want To Cry Anymore and I Will Follow aka Lead Me On was on the cd too.  But the last song is on the live dvd and cd but why did she leave the other 2 out again?  I can't wait to see her live again next week and watch her do these great songs again.  This was her best selling cd in over 20 years.  What's next for Cyndi Lauper in the music genre?  Either way she will shine again like always.

B005TPS0WG|4.0|So I have been watching the show since day ONE and I have to say the character development arc has been pretty freaking amazing. Between both brothers going to Hell and back LITERALLY, I shouldn't be surprised that maybe Dean has finally reached a limit, but still this episode caught me a little bit \\"off\\". He always seems to find a balance between necessary actions of a hunter and not losing himself completely to the Life I guess. So, Dean's actions in this episode struck me as a bit heartless, but I can see how after all he has been through he might be getting a bit worn out of keeping the faith and being strong; after all these years, between losing his Dad, the Apocalypse, then finding and losing Samuel, saving his parents a couple of different times, then going through everything with Lisa and Ben, now worrying about Sam and the situation with Castiel ... well, I just have NO idea what's going to happen!<br />Dean has always managed to pull everyone together but just the first few episodes of this new season and as the \\"big brother\\" he has already been through a LOT!! Honestly, it's still really well written, as always, and I hope we see more stretching of their characters as the season continues.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|\\"Submarine\\" is a coming-of-age dramedy set in Wales of the 1980s, narrated by its 15-year-old protagonist Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts). This is one of those rare cases where voiceover narration is not superfluous. Oliver is a socially awkward, introverted, slightly odd young man confronted with two challenges: getting a girlfriend and preventing his parents' relationship from disintegrating. Pretty mundane stuff and common grist for independent films. I've seen it all before -too many times. But Oliver and his annoying girlfriend and sweetly unhappy parents grew on me. This is Richard Ayoade's first feature film, which he wrote and directed, based on Joe Dunthorne's 2008 novel. He just hits the right notes. The trick is that Ayoade is not afraid to let Oliver be a selfish jerk.<br /><br />Oliver has his sights on his mildly pyromaniacal classmate Jordana (Yasmin Paige), and his plan is to win her over by bullying a chubby girl, which he thinks Jordana will find amusing. She does -then she tries to use Oliver to make her ex-boyfriend jealous. At least Oliver gets the girl. Then he wonders what he is going to do with her. Meanwhile, his \\"naturally neurotic\\" mother Jill (Sally Hawkins) is feeling lonely and frustrated in the face of his depressed, dweeby father Lloyd (Noah Taylor). Jill's old flame Graham (Paddy Considine), now a new age guru, has moved in next door, providing Jill an outlet for her emotions...and possibly and end to her marriage. But Oliver is determined not to let that happen.<br /><br />Oliver tends to do all the wrong things. And not because he's hapless and loveable. He does the wrong things on purpose. He's selfish and odd. I must give him credit for never doing the obvious. But there's something endearing about him after a while. His quiet determination is reflected in the film's tone. Although the parents are peripheral characters, I found them the most sympathetic. They're patient with their son and ultimately with each other.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie is clearly one of the best superhero movies of all time.  In the past, starting with movies like the Matrix series, the technology became available to create the necessary special effects to bring true powerhouse superheros alive on the big screen.  Prior to that, yes there were some decent superhero movies, and I cheered them all on because I love the genre, but there was always something missing.  Inconsistencies in the stories, poor special effects, shallow story lines, shallow characters, doesn't have right feel or right power level for the character, etc.  My biggest complaint with the superhero genre was that the Matrix movies were bigger and better than all of them from a \\"being super\\" perspective, and they weren't even superhero movies.  Some recent films have gotten very close, like Dark Knight and Ironman, but now a line is drawn.  Thor is at the top of the hill.  The casting was perfect even though I had some initial doubts, Asgard was beautiful, the acting was spot on, the special effects were colossal, you can feel the action/power/pride/depth and history of the story.  This get my coveted 5 stars and a hardy thank you.  Job well done to Marvel Comics.
B003UBH4GE|5.0|Great documentary about a great band. And, as entertaining as the movie is itself, the stuff on the second disc is even better. If you're a Rush fan and you have not yet seen this...well, you're not yet a complete Rush fan.  Stop looking at it and just buy it already.
0061990477|5.0|Colleen McCullough offers a four generation history of an Australian family in the first half of the twentieth century.  Made famous by the 1983 TV miniseries, the book greatly exceeds expectations.  The characters are believable, approachable and interesting.  The plot unfolds coherently, spotlighting key life experiences and history.  The 550 page novel moves quickly and is hard to put down.  Some of the characters, plot and questions are a little too neat, but that is a quibble.  This is a book about obsession.  Ancestors who leave Ireland and seek New Zealand.  A wealthy matriarch who accumulates extraordinary wealth but cannot control a single man.  A young woman who loses her husband due to family concerns, but fails to appreciate her new life.  Her eldest son who needs to be alone and dominant.  A priest obsessed with a quirky red-haired woman/child.  The object of his attention, who is attracted and then isolated.  A fill-in husband attracted to the manly life of physical labor.  A perfect child who dreams of God.  His sister who over embraces her personal individuality. The obsessions rarely turn out well.   The book is also about nature and God.  Nature and chance are heartless.  God does not intrude in obvious ways, so his role remains a mystery.  Most of the male characters do not obsess, but their lives are portrayed as satisfying but simple, like the sheep they tend.  Read this work for its broad perspective on human life.  The stories we hear in our heads determine the lives we lead.  There is a potential role for change and choice, if we have the courage.
B005974C94|5.0|Marsalis and Clapton are amazing. When this came out I knew I had to have this piece of history. What I did not know was how good it was going to be. Musicians to the highest degree. Thoroughly enjoyed the dvd. They should tour together.
B005MP28B2|3.0|On the five rating side was a great, yet easily available, visual montage of basic documentary scenes of waves, clouds, trees, planets, stars, volcanoes, lava, deserts all with the usual ethereal music. Also, great acting.   On the number one rating side was a simplistic contrived conflict (i.e. false argument) of purposeful design vs. natural evolutionary change (the bacteria to jellyfish to sea life to amphibian to reptile sequence). For some reason the film anthropomorphizes nature as greedy, selfish and self pleasing and lording over everything, as opposed to the alternative where if you love grace (i.e. purposeful design) there is no \\"bad end\\", there is no suffering because we all end up in a beautiful place eventually.    Alternatively is the metaphorical interpretation of the domineering authoritarian religious father and heir apparent destructive elder son who hunts/kills and grows to become an architect who coincidentally destroys the beauty of nature with glass/concrete artificiality, are seen in conflict/tension with the mother/wife who playfully communes with cows, trees, water and everything else natural.  Conclusion: If I want to see nature I'll watch the original documentaries from the people who worked hard to film them and not expropriated scenes and if I want a thoughtful discussion of biological principles and spiritual thought I consult those sources directly.  And, if I've misinterpreted then blame the writer/director for unnecessary obscurity.
B004EPZ084|2.0|Tried to watch this movie last night. It always seemed on the verge of being good, but could never quite make it. After a time, it started to really become annoying and i felt embarrassed for the actors. Kevin Spacey is on of my all time favorite actors and that's one of the reasons i watched it. Jennifer Aniston I only recognized by her voice at first. She looks like she's done something to her face. I do not recommend this movie. I could not finish it.

B005U9RQNU|5.0|I have seen every great action drama thriller badazz-to-the-core and blockbuster movie ever made...and the story, acting, and production quality (especially cinematography and soundtrack of Breaking Bad are right up there with the BEST, maybe even THE best and most entertaining show ever created from my point of view. The writing is OUTSTANDING, and simply on another level, far beyond anything I have ever seen before.  I wish Amazon had 10 stars to give, because 5 doesn't even do justice for Breaking Bad!  I have watched the entire Season 3 and Season 4...straight through...without a break on Amazon...it's that addicting, captivating, and a thoroughly entertainingly mind-blowing experience.

B004HD61KE|4.0|There's something about having Rollins on pre-order. :) I really enjoyed The Devil Colony, it's got the same irresistible blend of action and historical intrigue that characterize the rest of the Sigma Force novels. And having Painter Crowe back is always fun.<br />The only thing that brings this down to a four-star for me is that Rollins doesn't seem to know much of anything about Mormonism. It doesn't really matter to me, but some of my best friends belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, and I think it speaks of poor research for a best-selling author to misrepresent their faith.<br /><br />This book is still highly recommended.

B001N26GFM|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas provides a child's perspective on the Holocaust. This movie is masterfully crafted with a poignant narrative, which should be appreciated for its tremendous capability to acknowledge the immense tragedy of the Holocaust.

B004LWZW4W|4.0|As of the date of this writing, there are 72 Amazon reviews for Rise of the Planet of the Apes and not a single 1 star review. That is very rare and speaks volumes to how good this movie is. And unlike [[ASIN:B000SW16NK Tim Burton's 2001 remake]] of [[ASIN:B000E6ESEY the classic 1968 version]] of Planet of the Apes, it's also good to see that the little criticism that has been placed on Rise is not from preservationists that just don't like their classics tampered with.<br /><br />Rise takes the liberty of creating the events leading up to how a planet...our planet...could be overrun by apes that suddenly are able to think (more) intelligently and begin to speak. And the movie's writers and director do an excellent job of weaving it all together in a believable way. James Franco is a scientist looking for the cure to Alzheimer's. His initial test subjects?...You guessed it, and what initially looks like a smashing success leads to the potential fall of man. The story is simple and easy to follow, very dissimilar to Tim Burton's time travel explanations in his 2001 attempt.<br /><br />While the star of the movie is billed as James Franco, who indeed does a fine job in his role, the real star of this movie is little credited motion capture actor Andy Serkis. Serkis is a little known name for most people, but you'd probably be surprised at how many times you've seen him in a movie...or should I say seen his motions and more importantly his facial expressions in movies. You see, the apes in this movie are computer generated which is why they look so much more real than the plastic looking apes in all of the previous Planet of the Apes movies. But what's misleading is that the Rise apes technically are not 100% computer generated; in many instances when the apes aren't swinging from place to place or jumping around the room, you are actually seeing computer generated images overlaid onto actual character actors. And Serkis is Caesar (Serkis was also [[ASIN:B001KZVQJI King Kong]] in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of that film, and Serkis was Jackson's pick to play the diabolical Gollum in the [[ASIN:B0026L7H20 The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]]).<br /><br />As much as I loved the original movie that spawned 4 sequels, a television series and an animated TV series--and I was even one of the 6 people in the entire world that liked Burton's remake--I liked Rise of the Planet of the Apes the best. I can't wait to watch this on Blu Ray, and I recommend that you do too.ckson's 2005 remake of that film, and Serkis was Jackson's pick to play the diabolical Gollum in the [[ASIN:B0026L7H20 The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]]).

B003L77G6K|5.0|To anyone who was \\"not\\" one of the in-crowd in school, who felt a little out of it or was the school techie, this is your series.  Truly endearing characters portrayed by outstanding actors.  Each episodes is filled with chuckles and numerous big laughs.  Blu-ray extras are well worth watching as well.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love this game but where are all the extended play features the iPhone gets? They clearly just ported the game which I'm fine with honestly but couldn't they have at least ported the full featured version. No endless survival and no Zen garden makes this games life short lived.
0767903862|4.0|When I grow up I want to be a travel writer like Bill Bryson. He's funny of course but I so admire his ability to take the mickey out of people in a charming way, although I do sometimes wonder if they see it that way. I'll read any travel book he writes gladly, whether I plan to go there or not. This and [[ASIN:0380727501 Notes from a Small Island]] are two of my favourite ever books.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I have loved Sanderon's previous offerings, and I risk cries of \\"Heretic!\\" in saying that he made the Wheel of Time even better than it was before.  So I was eager to see how he would start a series of 10 books himself.   You can see a lot of the lessons he has learned in the last couple years by taking over WoT on these pages.  He has learned better how to weave a story for the long game but also leave us satisfied with the current run.  I really like how he thumbs his nose at some of the common tropes I have seen in fantasy.  The hero doesn't journey very much(but he does run a lot). This is a society that starts out really broken for most of the population, and there is true resentment there, like there would be in reality.    He reprises his rotating viewpoint style that was most notable in Elantris.  He again has three main viewpoints and each Act will feature two of them.  Between the acts are nice little side stories to flesh out other areas of the world and to catch us up with one particular character.  Now this is a very long book. I found myself both reveling in the fact I had so much more book left to savor and annoyed that I still had probably another couple weeks before I would be near the end.  He is always good with his endings.  The Kindle edition was nice, my only annoyance was that the images(maps and illustrations) were a tad awkwardly formatted and low res, so I couldn't zoom in on details.

Hitchens also participate on the documentary about her named Hell's Angel, which Agnes (according to her own words) didnt see, but she forgave him.  Would Jesus do that? Maybe.

B003CN4R74|1.0|\\"Too much Amy\\"  please!  Not enough in my opinion.  The album is a huge disappointment.  My original draw to Evanescence was the multi-heavily-layered tracks of alternative rock-classical mix \\"Art of Noise\\" sounds, and Amy's haunting voice. She has more musical writing talent in her little finger as do the rest of the guys in the band.  I think she gave them too much influence on the album.  Amy, do a solo project and dump all the other band members.  Adult contemporary is a genre you should consider! I love you Amy!

I just finished \\"Magic of Reality\\" and it was really inspiring and opened my mind up, not to mention it was a fun read! I know some people complain its a book for kids but trust me, its for all ages. I would say from 12-80. I just graduated college and thoroughly enjoyed the reading level it was at. Richard Dawkins writes everything so you can understand it and so it isnt so complex, not to mention the art work is great! I have always wanted to learn more bout science and htis book hits the nail on the head on most of the important subjects. Not to mention the myths are fun to read at the beginning of each chapter followed by what REALLY happened or what it REALLY is, based on factual science and research. The material I learned really opened my eyes to the REAL world and made me more excited that a lot of my questions have been answered. I look at the world in a different way now. A great book to learn facts when you get in a debate with a stubborn religious person. Pick this book up! You wont regret it...
B00417HV14|5.0|I don't know what people are griping about when it comes to the sound and video of this concert.  I never owned the DVD but there is no way that DVD has the kind of resolution that Blu-ray does.  It's not the best Blu-ray I've ever seen but it IS very good by Blu-ray standards.  Also, the audio options are both lossless: 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio and 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (even though they are labeled as DTS Stereo and DTS Surround 5.1).  Ironically, the stereo track sounds better (to me) than the 5.1 track...better bass and definitely cleaner on the high end  Actually, the stereo track sounds phenomenal.  I would take any criticisms of the sound and video from others with a grain of salt.  You can have good equipment but if it isn't set up properly, it'll sound like garbage anyway.  This is really an exceptional concert presentation.<br /><br />The concert itself is excellent.  I came across Joe Bonamassa a couple of weeks ago on TV and debated about buying this Blu-ray but it is absolutely top-notch...great songs and great performances

Won't admit how many times we've watched but will admit also to owning 92 episodes and looking forward to the next season. Not only are the special effects believable, the stories are excellent and continuity fantastic. And need I say the acting is exceptional. No sex, no bad language, no gore. The writers are to be commended for producing stories that keep one on ones toes, intellectually, while appealing to the heart.

Of course there's a thousand and one apps out there that can feed your escapism with high-end graphics and intricate story lines, but nothing will ever beat the joy that a game of checkers used to bring me on a rainy day.<br /><br />With only the options of playing another person or 1 of 10 AI settings and the choice of turning forced captures ON or OFF, this app sponsors a minimalist design which turns out to be fairly comprehensive in terms of what you would actually want.<br /><br />Kudos amazon for selecting another excellent app, which will undoubtedly be raped by today's reviewers. So far there are ten ratings with an average of four stars.

B005G4TJI4|2.0|The special effects are what you expect from the Transformers series, but the story line also is unfortunately what you expect.  It's just more of the same disjumbled events getting thrown together.  Some parts of the movie flow well, and others are just plain ridiculous.  It's past time the writers & director for this series either move on or grow up and quit turning every scene into some kind of teenage behavioral prank.  They've done the bumbling parents, the stuttering idiot Witwicky kid, the jive talking robots, and the goofball super secret ex-agent to death already.  How about having grown adults who are fighting for the planet's survival actually act like it?

B0059GVBHG|1.0|This is a depressing film thats basically about nothing. A bunch of oppressed proletarian stereotypes parade through a bleak urban wasteland full of death and violence. No escape. No redemption. No way out. The documentary accompanying the film is amusing in that it at one point features the all-too-german filmmakers trying to come with a rationalization for the film.   The original work is a collection of short stories. That format works against it being a film. The film ends up drifting around between thinly connected characters and stories in a rather aimless way. Rather than being a view of reality, the film comes across as the paranoid view of the world from a shut-in.   The source material had shock value in the early 1960s. But the days when this stuff shocked are long past. And shock IMO opinion never works when its isolated on its own anyway. Its the good bits intermixed with the bad bits that create real shock. Things like the strike lose their power because all of the people suffering are so horrible that its difficult to sympathize with them at all. For the film to work, it has to make you care about these people. And at least for my part, I didn't.

0385534639|5.0|Much like the circus in the book, The Night Circus seemed to come out of nowhere. It suddenly appeared on the scene and garnered massive hype -hype that I never fully understood or followed. It was not until glowing reviews started appearing on Amazon that I started to believe that the hype was real. Thus, I picked up a copy of the book from my local library.  Le Cirque des Reves isn't like any other circus. It is only open at night, and it hides magnificent secrets that no other circus could even hint at. Buried in mysticism, magic and beauty, the circus hides the strange romances, betrayals and battles going on behind the curtain. Celia, a fascinating and talented illusionist, takes up residents in the circus, and falls in love with Marco, another of the circus' members.   From the first page, Night Circus cast a spell on me. Every page -every sentence -is infused with magical, elegant prose that leaps off the page with emotion and life. It's been so long since I have read anything as enthralling, as enchanting and fabulous as The Night Circus. For once, the hype was worthwhile.  The Night Circus is an experienced not to be missed...
B000065V3H|5.0|Great 80's movie about an unpopular teen boy, Ronald, who wants to spend his senior year in school with the popular crowed. Cindy, head cheerleader, is at the mall trying to replace an outfit of her mom's that she wore with out her moms ok and spilled red wine on it. Ronald is at the mall too about to buy a Microscope. Ronald see's Cindy begging the clerk to replace the outfit and in return she would work off the money. The clerk wont go for it,that is when Ronald steps in. He tells Cindy he will spend his $1,000 on the outfit if he could hang around her for a month so he would become popular. She didn't think it would work, but she agreed. Things work out for Ronald. But once Cindy told everyone the reason they hung out Ronald went from geek to sheek and back to geek. In one of the girls words. This is a good movie. A must see by all.
B000H5UZM6|5.0|This Schleich Andalusian Stallion is of typically wonderful workmanship, beauty, and durability.  My two little girls love playing with their entire collection of Schleich ponies and faries - assigning \\"mommies\\", \\"daddies\\", and \\"babies\\", and playing endlessly in creative play - and this \\"daddy\\" fits right in with their collection.  Of course Schleich ponies are a little more expensive than other figurines, but in this case you do get what you pay for. Well recommended.

B001E45XT4|1.0|This is my second pair of this headset, and it just broke in the same way as the first one did.  The audio quality for both microphone and headset are marvelous.  But the mechanical design and quality of the material is below sub par.  My first pair broke at the slide-out area for sizing the headsets; and because it was three weeks out of warranty it couldn't be returned to them for repair/replacement.  If I could find the same type of headset from another manufacturer, I  definitely would buy their product instead of from Plantronics.
B005VA8AZQ|5.0|This show is crazy weird...but in a good way. It truly sets you on edge,and gets under your skin. The acting is terrific, especially Jessica Lange and the girl who plays Violet, the daughter. I also think that the house itself is a great character and has so many secrets to explore over the upcoming episodes.  It is a true haunted house story, but doesn't give everything away. It is scary without being overly gory, a little strange and out there, and has great potential to fill the shoes left when Nip/Tuck ended its run on FX. I was mesmerized the whole time watching it, and some of the visuals and scenes are original and terrifying and I know already to expect the unexpected while watching this show. One of my new favorites!
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|All I have to say about this movie is it have the wow factor loved it from start to finish not the usual full on gore fest but aa still gut wrenching 93 mins not 98 as stated on the box. Give it a go you will not be sorry I for one was not and neither were all the friens I lent my copy to.  Al Watts
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Couldn't wait for this movie after watching the first preview months before the movie's release date.  Was not disappointed!  I'm a long time Sherlock fan, from the written word to the old movies and PBS specials.  This movie is probably my favorite filmed version. Why?  Because it has so much action, color, humor, and sound. The main characters are young and fascinating!  Sherlock is the slightly demented genius he should be, Watson has a mind of his own to go along with his deep loyalty to Holmes, and the ladies are beautiful and crafty!  The villains are truly villainous, the story exciting, and the whole movie is fun, fun, fun!  Now, I'm eagerly awaiting the next film; I hope it is as good as the first one!  The blu-ray release is gorgeous, but the sound effects can be overpowering, even though they're appropriate.  I find I have to watch many dvds and regular TV shows with the volume control in my hand so that I can hear the dialog, but not be deafened by sudden blasts from the sound effects.  This is one of those cases, but does not keep me from highly recommending this blu-ray set!

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a TOUGH workout, but it's a great one. I wanted a workout that would help me tone up, and take some inches off, but wouldn't require a lot of time each day. Dedicating 20 minutes a day to the 30 Day Shred is very doable for me and, even though it is an intense workout, I enjoy it! There is a reason Jillian is called America's Toughest Personal Trainer, but she gets results! If you buy this video and dedicate 20 minutes a day to it, I believe you will be very pleased with the results.
B000WC4A8O|5.0|The only thing bad I have to say about this is that it seems criminal to make a box set and to fail to include \\"Hey Hey What Can I do\\" and \\"What is and What should never be\\" on it.  Everything else about it is fantastic.  Packaging is nice, sound quality is great, vinyl has low surface noise. All around awesome.
0345404475|3.0|The book arrived on time, but it had a lot of water damage.  The spine was obliterated, and there was something stuck to a few pages that I couldn't decide just quite what it was.    It was listed as acceptable, but I fear that it was unacceptable according to Amazon's definitions.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Happy days are here again!  I loved his first CD A Strange Arrangement and this collection of songs is even better than the last.  Unusual for a relatively unknown artist to have two incredible albums back to back, but Mayer Hawthorne has accomplished just that.  Henny and Gingerale is, in my opinion, the best of the lot and he saves it for the very last.  I love the short and sweet The News, what a great tune.  Among the other standout tracks are Get To Know You, The Walk, No Strings just to name a few.  Finally good music is back and if you love old sounding R&B with a new twist, this is THE MAN.  What a great CD, thanks Mayer, I can always count on you for great music.
B0058A119G|5.0|This Album(which I won BTW!)I listened and started to cry cause I have been on this journey with her most of the way!.... Got only the first disc cause I have the rest of the music, brings me back to the time when I was listening to Barbra more than 4 decades ago.My all time favorite album , if I had to pick one, is \\"Je M'appelle Barbra\\" and there are many reasons why I choose this one above all...I have listened to all her music more than 100 times each, so I know somewhat what MY tastes are....\\"Je M'appelle Barbra\\" was/IS so outrageously GREAT and extremely SUBLIME in the recording of it, that you may just overlook it but not Barbra..every single note,nuance etc is there in every song..it's so beautifully done, it rises above the rest....and to this album I will add this one. Music just does not just HAPPEN FOLKS!...If your a musician and living in NYC I know many, it just doesn't HAPPEN..so much work goes into each song and then Barbra is always a perfectionist and I say that with allot of LOVE cause her music has bought me many, many happy moments in my life..I will listen to a song and know where I was in my life.My close friend & I when we were growing up..well I was just crazy in love with her voice and what she could do..well I found out somehow(NO INTERNET BACK THEN) that she was premiering \\"Funny Lady\\" at \\"The Kennedy Center\\" in DC and that she would be there(I think she sang that nite, sorry don't remember)...but we did get tickets, sat in the rafters in BLACK TIE..and my friend nudges me cause he was on the aisle seat..\\"LOOK WHO'S SITTING NEXT TO ME?\\" it was Teddy Kennedy & of course my friend had a conversation with him & it seems it was the only place for him to escape! well I tell this story cause Barbra has really learned how to live HEALTHY with being the celeb she is now...many,many young people do not know how do deal with it and baby when you get to the top, it is HARD WORK to stay there! So you must show your face and be seen..Barbra was a person onto her own, she did almost what she wanted cause SHE COULD with that gift!.My friend who I went to DC with was born a \\"SAVANT\\"..at 3 years old, he could play ANY song on a TOY PIANO, he heard ONE TIME! well at 15 years old ,the black baby grand was in his bedroom but today after suffering a stroke, half of his body is loss and he does not want to hear music, so I slowly creep it into his life again..He will have to see it with different \\"eyes\\"..as Barbra has done throughout her ENTIRE career! A concert in Central Park..well OK, great idea but I didn't fathom THAT many people would show up in NYC! neither did she..That's another great album because it's the purity of her voice that I love the most, the nuances of every breath..50 years Barbra..I have been here with you, not in \\"GRANDMA'S HOUSE\\" but as an onlooker of your journey through life & it's amazing to me. That crackling of her voice in this CD(and in the CD recorded live at the amazing \\"Village Vanguard\\" BTW:MY NEIGHBORHOOD!)...sends CHILLS through me...THIS is THE BEST of the BEST..LOVE YOU BARBRA..BESOS!!<br /><br />TONY(NYC)n onto her own, she did almost what she wanted cause SHE COULD with that gift!.My friend who I went to DC with was born a \\"SAVANT\\"..at 3 years old, he could play ANY song on a TOY PIANO, he heard ONE TIME! well at 15 years old ,the black baby grand was in his bedroom but today after suffering a stroke, half of his body is loss and he does not want to hear music, so I slowly creep it into his life again..He will have to see it with different \\"eyes\\"..as Barbra has done throughout her ENTIRE career!

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I am always amazed when I discover people that say that they have never seen the movie, or heard the music. I just love it, and it doesn't get old to me.
B00080ZG10|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing film set.  First, the film is an absorbing and completely believable historical reconstruction of a remarkable and complex life.  Second, there is extensive documentary footage that puts not just the film in perspective, but also Hughes' times.  I have never seen such a successful biopic about an innovator - he was a film maker, an industrialist, and flyer, all of them the best at one time.<br /><br />The acting is first rate.  For starters, DiCaprio - one of the most under-rated actors by the critics - brought not only mood to the film, but meticulous research about the man, his genius, and his mental illness, which he put together in a performance that may be his best.  He is at turns charming, a megalomaniac, and a pathetically sick man, all while setting some of the most important precedents in world history.  Cate Blanchette is also perfect as the real Katherine Hepburn, with her rarified Connecticut accent and delightful iconoclasm.  It is doubly remarkable how she brings a real person out of one of the greatest chameleons in film history.<br /><br />For me, as a history buff, I will have to get a bio of Hughes - I knew far too little about him and in particular about his legacy.  He was a pioneer in aviation and created the standards for international commercial air, but also for the methods of high tech space hardware (amply covered in the wonderful History Channel bio on him).  All I remembered were his last sad years, which played out during my adolescence to the appalled fascination of the press.  Here, you get a multi-facetted portrait that will leave you hungry for more.<br /><br />Oddly, I bought this a long time ago and watched it once, half paying attention.  I didn't like it then, so it stuck on the shelf for over 5 years.  It just goes to show that owning a film can be important, because one might not be ready to see it the first time.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  Scorsese has proven once again that he is the best.

4770031246|5.0|This cookbook has been very useful! Her description and detail of bento meals and recipes are great, my purchase was very much worth it.
0670022950|5.0|Ok small confession to make. I was hoping to purchase this piece on the day it became available, power through it, and be one of the first to post a review on Amazon.<br /><br />This was before seeing the thing...<br /><br />But after pumping through the ~700 pages I feel its worth the size. Pinker dives through history, philosophy, psychology and politics to identify the apparent causes for the 'decline in violence.'<br /><br />I would describe reading the book as a combo of history, psychology and professional polemic. Obviously in picking up such a book, you're going to hear of some of the more gruesome and depressing events in human history, and some pretty scathing reviews of religon and politics. Nonetheless Pinker pursues his thesis scientifically (with a touch of humour) and even with some rigourous finger pointing maintains objectivity.<br /><br />While this piece is amazing, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't keen on the thought of this much non-fiction crammed into one book, and Pinker's style is very dense (in the compact not hurp durp sense.) this isn't really a 'translated into plain-speak' kinda of book (fair warning).<br /><br />Essentially if you've got the time, and the inclination this book will certainly give you food for thought, roughly a years feeding too...
B001C4CI8A|1.0|This review is not for the movie. The movie is fine and I am a fan of DiCaprio.  One of the reason I ordered this...I would like to get the second disc, so I can watch some extra and behind the scenes. But what I get is a single disc version.  I understand that with this price, I should be satisfied...however...if you are selling the one-disc version...do not say that you are selling the two-disc version.  I have to give 1 star, as I am not getting what I am buying
6303921248|5.0|I have always loved this story.  Each time I watch it I learn something new, or pic up something I missed last time.  Product arrived in very good shape and still has lots of years of wear left, even if it is on VHS!  Great seller!
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|I like the game and it seems to play pretty well.  However, I do not like \\"kinging\\" pieces.  As a true American, I respect the sacrifice of our founding fathers to throw off the oppressive yoke of a monarch.  This game seems to embrace the monarchy as a means of victory.  Was this game developed by Thomas Hobbes?  Though I have a work around.  Whenever you \\"king\\" a piece refer to it as a \\"constitutionally empowered executive constrained by proper checks and balances\\".  It helps, but my friends wont play with me anymore on the game because saying that takes up a lot of time, and I refuse to let them call it a king.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was glad that I had read the book before reading the first reviewers take on it.  The review to me seemed somewhat mundane and bland.  I am also the opposite of the reviewer in the fact that I am a huge animal lover. I have had dogs my entire life and I actually have three right now. I also feel comfortable in knowing that I maybe have a better understanding of what an animal, specifically a dog, has to offer to a persons life.  Their intelligence and loyalty never ceases to amaze me.  Along with my husband and two kids, I also have three other partners in life.  Some might think an odd thing to say but it's true.  What I loved more than anything about this book was the fact that from the very first few pages, I was living in that house with Enzo.  I not only related so well with Enzo but also with the spirit of the story.  I felt like I was with him on every adventure or lack of one. I felt like he was personally telling me his story.  I felt like I was watching him with Zoe, going to the in-laws, running in the park, driving/racing in the car, sitting at the coffee shop.  I felt like I was there the whole time and going through everything with the entire family, the good and bad.  I'm not going to tell any of the story because part of the greatness of the book is not knowing what is next and just going along for the ride.  And, what a glorious ride it was.  This book will wake you up emotionally because you feel every emotion possible.  Love, hate, sadness, happiness, fear, grief.  It's all here in this book.  Anyone who  can understand the unconditional love of a dog will love this story.  I was full of emotion and I have to admit it - it is the first book that has ever made me cry.  I absolutely loved this book.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|This is a very well designed. The AI is fun to play with and the option to play with a friend adds a lot to the game. Easy to follow game mechanics. Very recommended.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I'm so glad the wait is over.  I like watching this band grow and evolve.  This album feels like meeting an old friend again after years of separation.  It's exciting, surprising, empowering, and well worth the wait.  This is what happens when very talented people get together and put everything they have into a project while still having a great time.  Love it!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I was extremely impressed with this movie. It explores the world of X-men before there really were xmen. The story line is great all the way though... and mystique is hot as hell... not going to lie.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Its checkers on your phone or tablet, what more do you want?<br />It could have a touch more in A.I. rather then the CPU moving back and forth between two same spots over and over, but again its checkers so I guess the CPU plays like it should.

B002NUULNG|1.0|This release should have been the original unaltered version of the film. The changes made the film flawed and incomplete. I don't care if this review was helpful to you... this abomination doesn't deserve 4 stars.

B000SZQNLC|5.0|This is not just about Led Zeppelin. Next year I will celebrate my 40 years of listening to hard rock and metal. At this stage of my life I decided that its time to audit and so I started making a list of top 20. Number 1 position is generally fought by \\"In the Evening\\" and Metallica's Human. It is not my most favourite album from Zeppelin. That would be Presence followed by Physical Graffiti. But it is a very good album.
B005LJITS0|1.0|This was the worst superhero movie I've seen since Ghost Rider. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. The writing was terrible and Blake Lively needs to quit acting and go back to modeling. No wonder it made about the same in box office as Ghost Rider, but it actually had TWICE the budget! Hal was whiny and uninteresting,  the Guardians looked like muppets, and the credits ending with Sinestro made no sense in the context of his portrayal in the rest of the film. Hal's first use of the power was to kill a man (by punching him through a brick wall). But of course the consequences of that action were never dealt with. The romance was way overdone and had no chemistry whatsoever. There was no character development at all - the worst being the pathetic scripting for Angela Bassett 's role. Oh, and I'm sorry,  but how do you quit the Lantern Corps on day one and get to KEEP THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON IN THE UNIVERSE???   I will say that although Ryan Reynolds was miscast, Mark Strong was the perfect Sinestro,  and the only character worth paying attention to it the whole film.   Don't rent or buy this unless you are a hardcore DC Comics fan. If you aren't, you will regret your purchase. If you want a stupid movie with awesome eye candy,  rent Transformers 3 instead. If you want a great superhero movie rent Spider-Man 2, Iron Man 1, or either of the Chris Nolan Batman films.
B002EC3932|2.0|I really wanted to like this album, but I feel that it suffers from the same condition that permeates much of contemporary jazz these day: a lack of strong melodic ideas.  Without some degree of well presented melodies, the music on this CD failed to keep my attention.  Furthermore, the interplay and groove between the players never really locks-in.  Consequently, I often got the feeling that the solos and grooves would meander around without making any clear statements.  That being said, the players are good and the rhythm is stable.  Overall, I was not as taken with this record as everyone else on the intertubes.

PC is designed for a keyboard and mouse this its emulating that through a virtual keyboard and gesture based mouse actions.   If you plan on writing a report or creating power points yeah it will be frustrating. There are custom apps better suited for that. But if you need to manage files, watch Netflix, or browse the Web as if you were on a PC then this program does what it sets out to do.

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|My first outing with Nesbo and Harry Hole. This absolutely kept me on my toes throughout! Red herrings everywhere... no rest for the weary! I loved this - The Snowman lived up to all the amazing reviews, and cannot wait to read another in the series. If you enjoy edge-of-your-seat suspense, this is the book for you. One of the best I have ever read!

B0036TGSIK|4.0|Though an adult, I am not into raunchy or overtly sexual adult humor, especially if it degrades either of the genders (hated the hangover).  I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did by the cover and description  I expected a juvenile and sexually immature show, as most teen comedies are.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a movie about the female strength to overcome any obstacle thrown in her path and the male to overcome peer pressure when a girl he likes has a \\"bad reputation\\".
0393064476|4.0|I just finished \\"The Swerve\\" and must say I am a bit perplexed.  In the Preface, the author describes the reasons for his deep emotional attachment to \\"On the Nature of Things\\" by Lucretius.  My sense is that he let this emotional attachment get the better of him.  On page 68 (of the e-book) he states that \\"On the Nature of Things\\" is the work of a disciple who is transmitting ideas that had been developed centuries earlier.  Epicurus, Lucretia's philosophical messiah, ......\\".  Throughout the book, more reference seems to be made to Epicurus than Lucretius by the people that the author wants to propose as having been influenced by Lucretius. The final statement of the book, as if to emphasize how much the world has been changed by Lucretius is Thomas Jefferson's statement that he is an Epicuran.  So this reader is left with the question of why the focus on Lucretius? The answer to me can only be that the author found a good story in the discovery of a copy of the manuscript by a papal secretary, Poggio (and not the only one as seems to be alleged in the beginning - another was later found).  And a good story it is, weaving us through the inner working of monasteries, the copying of manuscripts, papal intrigue, \\"book hunters\\", and the preservation of \\"pagan\\" manuscripts in Europe.  What the author failed to do for this reader is convince me that \\"On the Nature of Things\\" caused, much less was significant to, the Renaissance.  Much is made of the work describing atoms, as was described previously by Leuccippus and Democritus, and that life's ultimate goal is pleasure and the avoidance of pain, Epicurus' central tenet, as being supremely influential in moving the(western)world forward in its thinking, and some of these thoughts, over 2,000 years old are quite remarkable in their prescience, but by no means unique to Lucretius.  But if these thoughts were so influential in moving the Renaissance forward did some of the clearly wrong claims in \\"On the Nature of Things\\"not hinder its development?  This is not addressed.  Other critics have complained of its seeming anti-Catholic tone, and as a recovering Catholic, I sympathize with you.  But I didn't find anything in the book unfair to the Catholic church of the time.  I found the book entertaining and enlightening in many respects, so 4 stars still.
B0039UTDA6|2.0|I will first offer background on myself. Due to the controversy among reviewers, I think this context is important. I am a student of physical anthropology and evolutionary biology, as well as a naturalist and holistic healer. I appreciate both the technical aspects of the life sciences, as well as the more integrative, right-brained, and artistic perspectives on nature and the living world. Over the last year (due to an injury that left be bedridden and later still severely limits my ability to leave the house), I've watched documentaries on nature, biology, ecology, paleontology and physical anthropology frequently - about 1 - 3 episodes or films a week, usually on Netflix streaming, sometimes on Netflix DVD. My preference is for those that have both stunning visuals and well-informed but clearly understandable scientific narration. That said, I have eagerly watched nature shows geared towards the non-scientific audience, as well as those made for children. I'm not picky, and will watch just about anything except for stuff purporting 'intelligent design' as a scientific theory (although I am a religious person, ID is essentially creationism masked as science and the films, which amount to political & religious propaganda, do not belong in the category of biology/nature documentary...I'm offended netflix even puts them there). But that's another review. I say it only to say, they are the only shows about the living world that I have ever turned off (after being tricked by the synopsis). Until now.  I am familiar with David Attenborough's work, but when I saw Life offered on DVD, I did not know about his version. I think Oprah is an admirable woman in general, and did not think anything wrong with her being the narrator. I even thought she might provide a fresh perspective that was less dry than usual, which I would not have minded at all. And I did expect to see her face, and looked forward to her engagement with the subject. I am a committed anti-racist, and go out of my way to watch films where people of color are given the opportunity to play lead or heroic roles (which are usually given to white people without even considering equally talented people of color). So I was excited to finally see a woman of color narrating a scientific documentary (if you know of any others, do tell) and I popped the disc in with an open mind, a positive expectation, and significant enthusiasm.  The cinematography is wonderful. Some reviewers have complained about much of it being in slow motion. I loved this, as it illustrates many things you cannot otherwise observe in such detail - For instance, in a scene where a lizard chases a elephant mouse, you can study the difference between the limb arrangements and mobility of reptile vs mammal quadrapeds (reptiles legs attach out to the sides making them scuttle, mammals have a more vertical stance with their limbs directly under their bodies, which offers less stability but more agility...another tribute to evolutionary variation). Life includes some of the best shots I have ever seen.  However, the epic failure in Oprah's narration floored me. Disappointment is not strong enough a word. She is reading from a terrible script. I don't know who wrote it. If it wasn't her, I can only blame her for not discarding it, as she is probably the most powerful woman in the entertainment world and could have influenced such a decision. Ultimately, I must blame the production company for allowing this to be released in such a sorry state. The script she is reading is so dumbed-down, lacking in educational information, and devoid of any references to natural selection - the very basis of undertsanding the animal world, nevermind genetics-  that I would be embarrassed to even show it at an elementary school. It is at the cognitive level of Sesame Street.  However, it is far less engaging and educational than Sesame Street. Imagine Maria, off camera, doing mystery science theater 2000, audibly struggling to read from a script. Something along the lines of  \\"Oooh Big-Bird. Look, at. that biiig bug...looks, like, it's going to, get-eaten! Big bugs don't sur-vive long in. the wild, Big Bird. They have, veeerrrry short. lifespans.\\" This is really my impression, I am trying to be truthful and not derogatory toward Ms. Winfrey. The script  is more the sort of vacuous commentary unintelligent people offer regarding commercials (wheres the beef, dude?), or, at best, the sort of patronizing explanation a kindergarten teacher gives to her charges (Apples can be red or green). It is extremely subpar for the narration of a semi-scientific, family-friendly odyssey about the life in our world, and how organisms survive and reproduce.  That would be bad enough, but for some inexplicable reason, Oprah offers none of the insight, wisdom, or intelligence that has propelled her thus far. Nor does her voice offer the rich sense of rhythm and engagement I have previously come to associate with it. It is obvious she is reading a script from a page, and she reads it in low monotone, with the occasional, I-know-better-than-you patronizing tone. This is not only baffling, as you might expect. It is absolutely jarring when juxtaposed against the epic work of the cinematographers, and after a few minutes, it became very distracting. I expected an explanation of what was going on visually, by a friendly but well-informed narrator. This was not only the absence of what I felt had been promised, it was much worse. It was the relentless presence of something that felt so distinctly *off*, fake, and at odds with the filming, that I could not make myself ignore it enough to enjoy the amazing visuals I was seeing. I hate to say it, I did not want it to be true, but I found Life to be  truly unwatchable. After about 10-15 minutes of optimistic struggling, the narration became such an impediment, I turned it off.  Though to my knowledge, this was not obviously advertised as a children's show, I believe thatvery young children would enjoy it. Even some grade school children. For that, and for the cinematography, it gets 1 star. It gets another star for just existing and offering a black, female narrator. I think that is important.  I considered giving 3 stars because of this, but ultimately did not feel that reflected the truth, considering my general tolerance for variation in nature films, and my inability to watch one episode of this one straight through.  Who really suffers as a result of this mismanagement? It doesn't do any wonders for Oprah's reputation, but she can afford not to care. I imagine many families of color would purchase this for their children, because the phenomenon of a black woman narrating a big-budget Nature documentary series is a seminal achievement in America (sadly this is still true in our day and age). But those kids, though they will benefit from knowing she achieved this role, and will enjoy watching the animals, will have to go somewhere else to get educational info about biology, ecology, or zoology.  And they deserve both representation and education at the same time. Considering the competition in science-realted professions, their rise in the global market, and the failures of the american public school system, particularly when in reference to children of color, it behooves any role model to provide American children with scientific information to bridge the educational gap that is created by underfunding, discrimination, poverty, and the general \\"dumbing-down\\" of America that targets the lowest common denominator.  Life should have been the antithesis of such dumbing-down, but instead it is a prime example.   Nevermind how the veritable trashing of Life by the scholarly will effect these kids, for whom Oprah represents a significant example of success, intelligence, and triumph over obstacles. Are there no scientists of color they could have casted? I suppose they thought Americans would only care about a black narrator who was\\"famous\\". This might well be sadly true, but she could have partnered with one, interviewing such a person throughout the film, asking them questions and drawing information out of them. That is, in fact, what Oprah does professionally.  Unfortunately, the American version of \\"Life\\" amounts to little more than a lot of pretty pictures and a wasted opportunity. Hopefully all involved in it's production will learn something from this mistake, even if the audience doesn't.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Thank you for enabling the option to disable autocaps.  One of my favorite features is the instant saving of words.  I can write something and realize I should have copied it but with SwiftKey I just rewrite part of the first word and I can follow the predictions to rewrite in seconds.
B004SC7B6M|5.0|More often than not, I find that any band I like eventually drifts towards mainstream, and produces a bland-sounding over-produced album that contains few if any elements from the older albums that made me like their music in the first place. This isn't one of those. True, this album initially didn't impress me as much as \\"The Heart of Everything\\" but with further listening I noticed things I didn't hear at first, and the catchy songs began to really grow on me.   This album doesn't really have the same gothic rock feel of the previous ones - many of the songs tend to be more upbeat and with faster tempo - but it continues to demonstrate the band's musical talent and Sharon's unbelievable vocals. If you're a fan of Within Temptation, you will most likely enjoy this album as much as the others.
0470876417|3.0|Business Model Generation is a must have in your business library. The co-creative collaboration is quite admirable. However, the book, while I own a copy and recommend it, and its authors agree the work is incomplete. Attention should be given to using the book as a general reference but not an operational guide. There are significant missing pieces that would seriously impact various types of business, for example, that have a foundation in R&D, Software Development or more importantly intellectual property. Beyond IP, the book deserves an index, while somewhat old fashion, I do believe it's mandatory in this case. In addition and lastly, the companion for electronic media is only on iPad, which constricts its value for the rest of the Business Model Generating world.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I did not expect this movie to be so good,but in my opinion any one who buys meat or veggies should watch this movie,after watching there is a great chance you will change what you buy and eat,in some cases this movie will also make you want to hunt your own food , just to avoid being apart of the inhumane treatment of these animals,because if you buy your meat you are just as guilty as they are!A must see for your own health and well being.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|It was ok I guess, the part where he told her he couldn't choose her ruined the momentum,  And seeing her Devastated laying in bed on top of the building afterward, wow. If they delete that scene then I'll give it 4 Stars.
143350393X|5.0|I don't know why, but of the plethora of translations that have come out since around 1990, the ESV is the first in a long time to just..idk...resonate with my heart. It's like reading the Bible afresh. It's a really subjective feeling, but I like it. As such the ESV study Bible is a wealth of information. For a long time, especially when I worked with Spanish-speaking ministries, I recommended pastors invest in a Thompson Chain (RVA version, standard Spanish for those who don't habla)because of all the study aids. The ESV, even if you don't like the translation, has a lot of nice articles, charts, etc. I'm not big on Bible study notes, but this one is pretty good. Which leads me to the only thing I don't like about it: it's thicker than my head. For study it's great. For carrying around church or to the pulpit, it feels like a ton. Remember the original and even the new Scofield Bibles? Those were like the perfect carrying size. This is not.
B004T81U4O|5.0|Amazon comes through again!!!  After searching the internet intensely, this is the only place that I was able to find this episode at the time.  Amazon and Prety Little Liars = A great combination!!!
B004EPZ07U|1.0|OK, I really enjoyed this movie and saw it twice while in the theatre. Now, the BD and DVD release are HORRIBLE. The picture is extremely dark. I do not know if not was authored this way or if it is defective. It was NOT like this in the theatre. I cannot recommend this release to anyone until they fix the picture issue.

B0055Q5F36|5.0|Just received the Otterbox Commuter Series case for the Samsung Galaxy SII and I love it. The item took about a week to arrive, which is ok for me. Wish the Defender Series is available for the SGS2, would feel more safer, but I'm satisfied with the Commuter. The case looks stylish and durable and it fit perfectly my SGS2(i9100). The case adds a little weight to the phone, you can feel it (considering the SGS2 is very lightweight) but thats good. I wish the surface at the back of the case were the same as the sides (which have a good grip surface). But the back is too soft and prone to get fingerprints. Besides that detail this case is excellent and worth having. Hope that the case stands time good and maintain the good qualities I see now. At this moment, I'm very satisfied :) Thanks!
0743277708|5.0|This book is one of my Top Ten. Ever. Not this year, not this decade, but E-V-E-R. In my whole life. Tears came more than once, and when the story ended, I had trouble starting a new book for a solid week because I just could not find anything that held my attention or even peaked my interest. Its like eating a meal prepared by a five star chef and then trying to eat McDonalds, nothing will ever taste the same again because I will always remember the way that this... I can only say masterpiece* made me feel.  Also, I got this book in Kindle edition, and I must say that wherever a Lapine (rabbit-ese) word or statement needs to be explained further, there is a very tidy link in-line with the text, which you can follow, and then follow another link in the explanation that will take you directly back to where you were before. Bravo to the e-scriptionists!  *(because I have reached the bounds of my grasp of the English language, which IS my first language, and cannot think of anything that actually describes it well enough...)  PARENTS, PLEASE READ:  I picked up this book because a friend of mine told me I need to watch the movie, and I do not like to watch a movie based on a book without reading the book first. I was always under the impression that it was a children's novel and that I would finish the book in a couple of days and probably snicker at a cheesy, over-softened story about rabbits hopping through fields of flowers. I was shocked at the length of the book when I opened on my Kindle, and by the end of the first chapter, I knew that I will not let my children read this book until they are well mature enough to grasp the meaning of the words without being left with nightmares.  If you are a parent who is thinking of reading this novel to your child(ren) then please pay attention here:  End of chapter one, VERBATIM QUOTE -  \\"Back to the burrow?\\" whimpered Fiver. \\"It'll come there - don't think it won't! I tell you, the field's full of blood!\\"  The entirety of the book follows a similar theme, from rabbits being strangled to death or near by men's traps, to rabbits clawing and ripping each-other's ears off, this is a mature novel. Suitable for middle- and high-school students.
B005974CDU|5.0|Awesome disc!!  Dream Theater created, in my opinion, the best album only compared to scenes from a memory. John Petrucci did an amazing job not only as the guitarist but also as a lyricist and producer. The music has a well archived balance between the progressive and the metal elements. The sound is outstanding due to the work of Paul Northfield and Andy Wallace, in which you can hear the bass lines again and the keyboards are bigger than ever! And finally the vocals sound really good in this particular disc, even though I am not the biggest fan of LaBrie´s style of singing, but in this songs he really fits perfectly.  If you are into progresive music this is an absolute must have!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a challenging puzzle solitaire game that is a treat for the eyes, has a soothing soundtrack of vaguely new-agey piano jazz-- and is utterly addictive. Slide the raindrops through increasingly challenging levels, through one-way gates and wrap-around passages, collecting pearls and avoiding poison pits and spikes. Each level gets just a little more impossible. Look up quite suddenly and- uh oh-- hopefully you aren't missing any critical appointments! (But surely there's time for one more strategy?!) My only criticism is that when the player chooses \\"get a hint,\\" the game delivers the solution for that level, instead of an actual hint. Happily, that just means going on to an even more ingenious challenge. Oh, and there's a sequel (just in case anyone runs out of challenges)!
B003OA6AOI|1.0|The acting on this show is normally okay but this is really really bad! The story is silly but that is par for the course with Torchwood and Dr. Who and I normally like it. When you combine it with the really bad acting here it really is a bad episode. It is ALL of the actors too so maybe the director just let his intern take over for the day.
B003L77G6A|4.0|Great transaction. The product is in great shape, exactly what was listed, and came extremely fast. I would order from them again.
0783226845|4.0|I purchased this movie specifically for the dance scene in which Al Pacino and Gabrielle Anwar performed a Tango for her first time which in my personal opinion is the high lite of the movie, but the rest of the movie is also a pleasure to watch in it's entirety. Al Pacino's depiction of Frank Slade, a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel blinded by his excessive uncaring behavior towards others and himself in particular is not only performed in his normally wittily manor, but believable also.  Chris O'Donnell performance was also outstanding as an underprivileged collage student from a small Oregon town which was placed in a \\"tell on your classmates or else\\" position. His honesty and Vulnerability in his performance can only be viewed as well done. I give this movie a four star instead of five star per the earring situation in the dance scene but the movie is a definite. Thank you for your absorption...
B0034G4P8A|1.0|might be an OK movie to occupy an 8 year old but I lost interest three minutes into it (it's that bad, and lets you know quickly that it's going to be)...
B004K583KA|4.0|Rilling was not the first to record all the cantatas; Leonhardt and Harnoncourt were, and their set is available relatively cheaply these days, but it features all male singers, meaning that the arias for soprano, sung by boys, vary in quality.  Rilling's set is the antithesis of the HIP approach that L&H took. His is a lush orchestral sound, with a very strong choir. His soloists are often excellent, but two things make this one of the last sets I turn to. (I have 6 complete Cantata sets.) First, Rilling's tempi can be a bit turgid at times; there's is often too much solemnity and not enough joy. Second, the recording process is weird; there is often a soloist on one channel, an obligato instrument (such as a violin or oboe) on the other channel, and the main orchestra in the center. This is especially annoying on headphones.  Gardiner's \\"Bach cantata pilgrimage\\" set is far superior in so many ways: more energy, more subtlety, better soloists. Suzuki's soon-to-be-finished-in-a-few-years set on Bis is excellent as well, but sometimes too clean. But I'd take either of them over Rilling any day. At this price, if you're a fan of the cantatas, it's a must-have set, but I wouldn't want this to be the only set one has; Rilling's approach is too limited for such astounding music.
B002ZG97LK|2.0|I went into this movie really hoping they would do right by the original, which is a fine movie. After seeing the remake, it's very clear just how fine the original was. The remake failed to capture any of the spirit, youthful exuberance, or sincerity of the first one.   The script was the first problem. Very surprising since Dean Pitchford co-wrote it, and wrote the original. In his attempt to make the script more contemporary and relatable, he wrote out all the genuine emotion. Everything was explained to the point of hitting the audience over the head. Just one case in point: we start out by going straight to the fun toe-tapper of a theme song, everyone dancing, and a few seconds later BAM...we get emotionally jerked out of the feel-good fun time of hearing that nostalgic song and into the contrived sadness of Bobby's death, which paints too plain a picture of why Ariel is so rebellious and messed up. In the original, one simple conversation as they drive over the bridge after the night at the club, and Lori Singer's Ariel reacting to telling the story of Bobby's death was all we needed to feel her pain, and to finally understand, at the same moment Ren does, why she is the way she is. It was much more genuine and packed a much greater emotional punch than the remake's overly sappy church scene when Reverend Moore pours his heart out to the congregation. The bridge conversation just feels like overkill by that point.   The characters were also much more one-note and two-dimensional that the original characters. Julianne Hough's Ariel was just a little naughty and self-destructive. Lori Singer's Ariel was borderline crazy. You could see clearly that something very serious ailed her soul. Not so with Hough's Ariel. Even when the script again hits us over the head by having her tearfully come out and say \\"I've been losing my mind\\" you don't quite believe her in the way you knew Singer's Ariel was losing her mind, and she never even had to say a direct word about it.Ren's uncle was more like the mill boss in the original, and Ren's mom is gone altogether. Reverend Moore and his wife, Vi, portrayed by Dennis Quaid and Andie McDowell this time around, also felt flat and one-note. This seemed to be in part the way the characters were written, and in part how they were portrayed. Quaid and McDowell are fine, competent actors, but they simply cannot hold a candle to John Lithgow and the sublime Diane Wiest. McDowell's Vi betrays her own basic nature by shouting to get attention for Ren at the town hall meeting. But Wiest maintains Vi's quiet restraint and tendency toward deference in how she simply, and quietly says \\"Eleanor, sit down.\\" And achieves even more impact than McDowell's out of character shouting. Likewise Quaid's Shaw Moore only had one level, barely  maintaining a calm and trying to hold things together. We never really see him struggle with the inner turmoil that Lithgow made so clear, and we never really see Qauid's Shaw smile. When he slaps Ariel, we don't really see what built up to lead him to do such a thing, and the fact that he does it when she is fresh from the beating by the bad ex boyfriend makes Quaid's Shaw far less sympathetic and relatable. Lithgow's Shaw never even found out about Ariel's run-in with Chuck, greater illustrating the chasm between daughter and parents. When Lithgow's Shaw smacks Ariel at the breakfast table in the original, we have a better understanding of why, and the tension between all three family members is much more palpable. In the conversation that follows, we can see Vi means the praise she gives Shaw, and in the same moment, when she says \\"but it's the one on on where you need a little work\\" we see her anger and frustration as well. Lithgow's and Wiest's performances made Shaw and Vi real, human and three-dimensional in a way Quaid and McDowell didn't even touch.   There was also very little if any exposition as to why the whole town put their youth on lockdown after the accident. There is no sense that the town is a powder keg ready to blow and the accident was just the match. The book burning incident, the town's irrational fear of anything modern or outside the acception convention, the discussion about the fired English teacher, Slaugherhouse Five, the sense of the mindset of the majority of the townsfolk, were all missing from this reboot.  I'm sure Footloose will make a nice load of  money, and it is not without entertainment value. But when it comes to quality, memorable teen films, the original will still go down in history, while folks say, \\"did they ever do a remake of that?\\"
B0053F042G|5.0|We would watch it again.  Acting - 5 out of 5  Plot - 5 out of 5  Special FX - 5 out of 5   You know, it isn't often you get to see a movie that takes you from beginning to end without a moment where you think \\"what's in the fridge\\".  This one does.  There's tons of tension.....lots of twists and turns and the whole thing well produced.  I would even recommend this one to people who are not big fans of scifi.

B003Y5H574|4.0|Perhaps the best pairing is of Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling. They are both big talents with Gosling coming up very strong on the outside. He picks his roles better than Carrell across the board and that could be because he's been in the business since he was a kid with the Mickey Mouse Club. He's paid his dues. The two men have many excellent scenes together with Gosling having the harder role as a womanizer whom you grow to like, a real feat. The film is both a comedy and a drama since it tries to stay close to real life.<br /><br />This is an ensemble piece, however, which may have prevented the two men from being really great. We had many other characters including many women, two kids, Julianne Moore as the wife, and Marisa Tomei in a smaller role as a teacher. So they all have their fallings in and out of love too and, even Kevin Bacon has a small role as Carrell's wife's love interest, which causes her to open the movie with asking for a divorce.<br /><br />Emma Stone as the divorcing couple's lawyer daughter who begins dating Gosling without her father knowing also shows a great deal of promise.  She was probably the best woman in the film, followed closely by Tomei.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0052VUNHC|4.0|Loved it, couldn't put the book down till I finished but usually this disaster of a relationship is not something I would promote.  Though the key element from the beginning that was missing was honest communication, but then this book would be half the size. The story and the characters flowed well for me and as much as I didn't want to like it.. I did.

B00012QM8G|5.0|This must be one of the most touching films about the Holocaust ever made.  Without being maudlin or excessively violent, the dramatization of the actual events are horrifying in themselves.  No manufactured graphic violence is needed.  Oscar Schindler is himself transformed by all of the attacks and humiliation of the Jewish people and becomes a saviour to 1100 of them.  I wonder if I would have behaved as nobly as this flawed man.  The thought is sobering.
B005F3XV62|5.0|I wish my family had seen this in the theaters! The movie critics were very wrong about this film. This is one of those rare gems that the whole family can watch and everybody finds funny. The story line isn't anything new or exciting, but the exchanges between Kevin James and the animals are hilarious! We all laughed out loud. This one is one of those that you won't mind your kids watching many, many times.
0345529057|5.0|These books are great!  I was a fan of the show and wanted to read the books.  At first it was hard to follow although having seen the show helped a lot, but now I find that I get lost inside the books!  great fun to read

B001PB3RU8|5.0|I had only discovered Florence at one of the award shows on TV about a year ago (I think it was the MTV Video one where Lady Gaga won best video for \\"Bad Romance\\").  Anyhow, I never got around to listening to Florence until very recently.  I'm quite blown away by such ear-capturing talent, and I'm surprised I had waited so long to check her music out.  \\"Lungs\\" is a very good and solid debut album.  I literally enjoy all thirteen tracks, but the ones that stood out the most are: \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\\" \\"Kiss with a Fist,\\" \\"Girl with One Eye,\\" \\"Drumming Song,\\" \\"Cosmic Love,\\" \\"Blinding,\\" and \\"You've Got the Love.\\"  Out of those eight, \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\\" and \\"Cosmic Love\\" for sure.  She also has very nice music videos, especially the one for \\"Dog Days Are Over.\\"  I also managed to listen to her two new tracks from the forthcoming \\"Ceremonials\\" album.  I honestly like them better than any of the ones from \\"Lungs, but that'll be for a review on her sophomore effort.  Overall, she's almost like a wilder and edgier Adele (in my opinion).  Her vocals could resemble that sound that seems to be popular in the UK.  I like this music style much better than what the U.S. top 40 realm generally offers, and I'm from the U.S.<br /><br />I rated this album five stars because the production quality is decent, and I enjoyed listening to it over and over.  When you start to play it to death, you know that's when you've truly enjoyed the album.  Her vocals are wonderful, too!  I honestly can't comprehend why some people here are even complaining about her \\"yelling\\" and the \\"poor quality\\" of the music.  I just don't experience that at all.  I'm not kissing up either, since there's obviously a reason why I continue to play her songs countless times.  Then again, I've always had an ear for edge (not that Florence really is all that edgy).<br /><br />So, great job, Florence + the Machine!  You've just earned a new fan!  I cannot wait to purchase \\"Ceremonials!\\"  May you go far in your career!remonials!\\"  May you go far in your career!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Nicely done. I liked all the inside information and of course the colour is very vivid. In one word FANTASTIC and it is worth buying!!
B000VZJUGY|5.0|In my opinion, this is Trent's best material to date (but that's not to say I don't enjoy any of his other albums).  It's very heavy with some mellow moments as well.  I've always liked how Trent goes from the rage of the guitar to that soft, toy piano \\"ballad-y\\" moment as a nice and moody transition (much like in \\"Mr. Self-Destruct\\" when the bridge begins).  I'm not going to lie... this is the album that introduced me to all the dark artists/bands I enjoy, and I'm sure I'm not the only one out there.  After discovering other dark acts that I find more enjoyable (especially with better and deeper lyrics than Trent's), I will always appreciate NIN's music and will continue to purchase future albums (that is, if there will ever be a new release).  \\"Mr. Self-Destruct,\\" \\"Heresy,\\" \\"Closer,\\" \\"March of the Pigs,\\" \\"Ruiner,\\" and \\"Hurt\\" are the tracks that stand out the most to me, with \\"Heresy\\" being my favorite.  And the music video for \\"Closer\\" still blows me away.  I wish Trent could continue to produce music in this style, but I understand that styles tend to change.  Oh, well.  It's my favorite album of NIN's, and a great classic at that!<br /><br />I rated this five stars because it was groundbreaking for my ears.  I had never heard anything like this before I listened to this album, and even the production quality was decent for its time and for it being a cult hit.  The lyrics could afford to be a bit more advanced, but whatever.  Also, while I don't worship this album like some people do, I still love and enjoy it for my own listening pleasure.  There's no reason for me to give it a lower rating.  It is what it is.<br /><br />EDIT:  I've noticed some negative reviews complaining about the heavy electronica vibe in this album.  Wasn't that the whole point?  He was never really fully rock to begin with (\\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" was not rock music).  He was inspired by industrial music (that is, if this isn't classified as industrial), and industrial was practically all electronics.  But to each his own.  Everyone has the right to enjoy whatever genre he/she enjoys.  Life would be quite boring if we were forced to enjoy the same things.to each his own.

B005OCFHHK|1.0|This review or rating is NOT for the quality of the films, it's for the quality of this boxset!  Well, converting the currency into pounds, it comes to approx £62, which is very much overpriced!  With the UK edition, not only is it £30, yes £30 cheaper, but you also get 3 bonus discs for the last 3 movies! i'm speechless into how expensive it is....
B005COO1X6|3.0|Nothing real scary or special. It's around 80 pages, so I think it is overpriced. It should be a buck, buck and a half tops.
1439192812|3.0|I wish more science writers would familiarize themselves with Asimov. For 30 years he set the bar for these types of essays and trusted that younger readers, when not patronized, would follow him to a depth of material that does not exist in Dawkins's book. There's plenty of passion here and some very clear explanations of basic concepts; I haven't seen the concepts of evolution explained that well in many years. Nevertheless, if you (as a young person) actually want insights into the subjects of these chapters, the book will leave you wanting.
B005FFW46S|3.0|Not done with the book yet and am enjoying the story but the kindle version is so bad its insulting.  For shame to the editors for charging this much for shoddy work. For shame.

B005G4TJI4|1.0|First of all, its boring. At the 30 minute mark I forgot what movie I was watching. And at two separate points in the film (I forget what points, in fact I seemed to lose all perspective on time) I literally went cross eyed. My right eye is still lingering in a lazy wobble at the moment. All I really do remember was rooting for Leonard Nimoy to destroy the planet and all the retarded humans that inhabit it.<br /><br />Things I learned from T3 - Michael Bay's film making talents could effectively be adapted into a new kind of non-surgical lobotomy procedure for mental patients. I think I dodged the bullet on permanent catatonia due to the fact that I spent half of the movie day dreaming about more exciting things in my life...like porn, and rearranging my sock drawer.
B00466HN86|5.0|Saw this movie with my whole family and am praying that God will use this for His glory.  It is well made, and with a message that is so necessary today which if taken to heart and acted upon, we as a country could fix a lot of our problems.  I highly recommend it but make sure you bring some tissue.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This has been a sheer disappointment. This product doesn't work at all. I'm not even going to bother trying to use it in a (superbly?) \\"well lit\\" environment, because it's not realistic. A waste of money.
B0009UC810|1.0|My copy was pixalated a great deal. Unwatchable. The original side had a blank 20 seconds of silence as well. Horrible copy. The copying aparatus must be faulty, and there weren't quality control measures in effect. I returned it for a refund.Last week.I still want it. But Amazon is not able to supply it as Amazon is not the source. Yes I bought it through Amazon...Amazon is ALWAYS fast and hasn't made a mistake yet.

1400052181|5.0|Really good book! It connects a lot of different issues together perfectly. Discusses race, history, medicine, and the personal life of Henrietta and her family. Got it in perfect condition, and on time. Simple, perfect delivery.
B003Y5H57O|5.0|I just saw this movie on the big screen last night and I loved it!!!!  I also loved the old one with Kurt Russell.  The special effects are excellent!  The story line is close enough so you know you are watching what you came to watch, a remake of The Thing, yet there are some differences at the same time, plus a clever ending, which I won't spoil for those of you who haven't seen the movie!  The clever ending is revealed while the credits are rolling.   Though I have seen and loved Kurt Russell's version of The Thing and I knew what was going to happen, the movie was still terrifying and kept me on the edge of my seat! I loved this movie and plan to buy it on DVD as soon as it comes out!
B000I5X824|5.0|Staind is one of the best bands ever. While their music may seem generic to many, it has personally made me more happy about myself, particularly in Break the Cycle. Aaron's moaning about life inspires me to be a better person and to be more of a man. No joke. So, in 2006, they gathered up most of their hits from a ten year period and placed them on a Greatest Hits album with some live tracks and an exclusive remix of a track off of the 1997 album Tormented. The end result is a ride that will make you feel proud of yourself. The album feels more like a transition from a broken person to a changed person in the matter of 11 tracks. The singles from Tormented and Dysfunction are typical nu-metal topics. The Break the Cycle singles are of broken matters, while the next two album's singles are of changing. I am well aware that they did leave out How About You, Just Go, and Fade, and live tracks don't always feel necessary, but Staind does well with anything.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars
B005CAAXXM|5.0|I became a ginormous fan of this band after \\"Tall Poppy Syndrome\\" and have been adamant about recommending to everyone I know. They are a breath of fresh air in the metal world and this album is an amazing progression in their still young sound. This past month was a great one for progressive metal with releases from my favirote band, Opeth, my other favirote Dream Theater, this album, and the upcoming release of Three's newest record. I've gotten them all so far and, for me, Leprous' new record beats the others by a large margine. Now *that* is saying something because I've been a fan of DT and Opeth for over 15 years respectively.<br /><br />I don't want to get into a long-winded description track by track. The main thing about this album is that it is more song oriented than TPS was in that each song(except for two of them) are generally much shorter and more focused on a central theme and/or melody. Likewise, the harsh vocal stylings are more sparse and only a focal point of a song in one or two tracks whereas they were more of the focal point before. This doesn't mean they did what Opeth did with \\"Heritage\\" though. The music stays pretty much to their style but the distortion has softened up a bit in parts and there are a few more \\"softer\\" tracks on this record. The songs are just so dynamic though. One particular song features Ihsahn on the vocals and the entire musical theme of the track is much more \\"metal\\" than the rest of the album. I love how it caters to his presence and almost sounds like a track ripped from his solo trilogy, even though it totally fits this album.<br /><br />Most of this album is still in their avant-garde, ecclectic brand of metal though. There is just so much variety in the riffs and vocal structures that's hard to really pigeon-hole this at all. TPS was more direct in its theme, but this album tends to jump around and offer something new with every successive track, an amazing feat these days. The keyboards are there in spades yet again and add so much to the already full sound. Tor's vocals are killer, moreso than they've ever been and he shines on this album. He puts so much feeling and emotion into his work and it sends chills down my spine on almost every single listen. His melodies generally drive every song on this record and there are many Opeth styled hummed sections that just jump out at you. I love their ability to write music that matches up with his vocal melodies and they do that 7/10 times on this record creating vibrance few can match. Their drummer Tobias is one I consider to be one of the best in the scene in terms of creativity and he shows it once again here with off-tempo rythmes and some great moments in songs like \\"Restless\\" where a the jazzy syncopation drives the song more than anything. It's those moments where he is important because you realize that he is bringing something more to the music.<br /><br />Everything about this record moves Leprous somewhat away from the more metal oriented \\"Tall Poppy Syndrome\\" and finds them, I believe, coming full circle into the sound that will define their career in metal. They, like Opeth, have strength in bring truelly skilled musicians who *can* overplay and throw their skills in your face but restrain themselves by using their mature musical acumin to create something truelly \\"musical\\". When a song demands harsh vocals, they'll use them. When a song calls for a wonderfully sung clean chorus with light synths in the background, they'll go that way. When a drum solo accompanied by some guitars riffing playing off synthesizer riffing pops up, they'll just flow with it. But one thing Leprous will never do is ruin a song to indulge. I've never heard a Leprous track I didn't like or love and there is nothing on this album I'd consider second-rate. If you're a fan of bands like Opeth, Riverside, Three, or even more extreme bands like Enslved or Ihsahn(the solo artist from Emperor that both help Leprous and uses them as his live band btw), I guarantee you'll eat this album up. If you don't, I will personally refund you your money...maybe.is album up. If you don't, I will personally refund you your money...maybe.
1594744769|5.0|Peculiar is one of those, well, 'peculiar' words. This story begins in a very mundane way in Central Florida when 16-year-old Jacob, who works in his family's chain of convenience stores, checks on his elderly grandfather, only to find that the old gentleman has been lured out to the woods behind his house and is found dead, apparently having been jumped by a vicious animal. Seemingly a sad end for the man whose stories of life on an island called Cairnholm amid various other children who each seemed to have a special gift (levitation and invisibility to name just two). For Jacob, these were his grandfather's stories although they were accompanied by old, yellowed photographs.<br /><br />The truth that Jacob comes to understand was that sometime during the early years of WWII his grandfather was sent away from home to avoid Nazi occupation and he ended up on Cairnholm. When Abe Portman (Jacob's now deceased grandfather) whispers unrelated clues as he is about to die, Jacob believes that the old man had finally lost his mind after living alone so many years. Jacob somehow can't shake his grandfather's stories out of his mind, especially when he opens a box that contains the old photos and some letters written by a woman.<br /><br />Jacob's parents send him to a phsychologist to help him see things more clearly. But when the doctor agrees with Jacob that a trip to Cairnholm, the place of his grandfather's stories, might help the young man, Jacob's father agrees to make the trip with him. A would-be ornithologist, Jacob's dad decides to study the birds of the island and perhaps come away with enough material to write a book. Left to his own devices, Jacob goes off to explore The House where grandfather once lived and search for clues to the old man's final, cryptic words.<br /><br />From this point on the story moves into the fantasy of time travel and parallel universes. Jacob finds himself meeting the very people who have populated his grandfather's stories, still alive on another plane in time.<br /><br />This is a mezmerising story of adventure and fantasy rolled into one. A page turner that will have you wondering about every person you meet. Surely there's more to us than meets the eye.<br /><br />Debut author Ransom Riggs has delved into the minds of his characters and brings to life every one of their eccentricities. Rather than pulling back from their peculiaritis in revulsion, you'll find yourself rooting for the underdog in more ways than one.<br /><br />I certainly hope that there is a sequel for this book. Put my order in now.This is a mezmerising story of adventure and fantasy rolled into one. A page turner that will have you wondering about every person you meet.

0385732554|5.0|The Giver is an extremely well written book. My friends and family recommended it, so I decided to read it for my book project. I was pleasantly surprised because the book had such an interesting plot. One of my friends said it looked boring, but I told him to never judge a book by its cover!     The protagonist, or main character, Jonas, is followed as he awaits the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas lives in a standard family unit with his mother (a judge), his father (a \\"Nurturer\\") and his Seven (later becomes Eight) year old sister named Lily. Each person is part of an age group, but instead of calling them seven years old, for example, they would call them a Seven. Each aging ceremony, they get a new item, like a bicycle. When the day of the Ceremony of Twelve arrives, each of the Elevens is called up by their number, which corresponds to the order in which they were born, (Jonas is nineteen) and is given their Assignment. However, the Chief Elder skips Jonas' number and proceeds with twenty. After everyone has been given their Assignment, the Chief Elder calls up Jonas and apologizes for the confusion. It is revealed that Jonas has been selected to be the next Receiver of Memories. The Chief Elder reveals to him that training will involve physical pain that the community has never felt before. He is selected to be \\"Receiver of Memory\\" at the Ceremony of Twelve because of his unusual \\"Capacity to See-Beyond\\", which is the ability to see color), which the other people in the community cannot.    After Jonas has been selected to be the Receiver of Memories, he is set aside to receive training through the Giver (who was the last Receiver of Memory), who becomes his teacher. Jonas telepathically receives memories of things eliminated from his world: violence, sadness, and loss, as well as true love, beauty, joy, adventure, animals, and family. Having knowledge of these complex and powerful concepts changes distinguishes Jonas from his friends and family, as well as makinghim more questioning towards his previously sheltered life, as he often discusses with the Giver. Eventually, Jonas attempts to seek to change in the community and return meaning to the world. He and the Giver plan on doing this by having Jonas leave the community, which would cause all of the memories he was given to be released to the rest of the people, allowing them to feel the powerful emotions that Jonas and the Giver feel. Eventually, Jonas asks the Giver if he ever thinks about his own release. This conversation leads to watching the release of a lighter child of a set of twin boys born that morning. Jonas watches in shock and horror as his father talks sweetly to the baby before giving the newborn a lethal injection, and then dumping the body down a garbage chute. It is also said by The Giver that the previous Receiver of Memory had applied for release, and had told them that she would prefer to inject herself, and this turned out to be the Giver's daughter.     During the course of the novel, Jonas's family temporarily houses a baby named Gabriel, because he is unable to sleep throughout the night and disturbs the other babies in the \\"Nurturing Center\\". Jonas learns that unlike the other people in his community, Gabriel can receive memories from Jonas, which he uses to help calm the baby. Because Gabriel still cannot sleep through the night without crying after the extra year he was given to learn how to sleep soundly, he is now destined to be released. Jonas flees the community with Gabriel to save the baby's life. Also, he was given the instructions from the Giver to flee, and release all the memories that he had stored to the rest of the community. At first, the escape seemed successful, with all of the search planes finally giving up their search for Jonas. Soon, however, food runs out and they grow weak. Cold and hungry, Jonas and Gabriel begin to lose hope, but then remembering the memory of sunshine Jonas was given, he uses it and regains strength.Jonas begins to no longer care about himself, but only about Gabriel's safety; it is here that he feels happy as he remembers his parents and sister, his friends and The Giver. Jonas and Gabriel cross a snow-covered hill in the dark and find a sled on top, which Jonas remembers from the first memory he ever received. He and Gabriel board the sled and go down the hill where they seem to hear music coming from some houses.    The ending is left on a cliffhanger, with Jonas depicted as experiencing symptoms of hypothermia. This leaves his and Gabriel's future unresolved. Many people today debate over whether Jonas died, or survived.    In conclusion, the Giver is now my favorite book because of its amazing plot and the author's ability to describe an unreal society. I definitely recommended it to anybody grades 5 and up because the book can get a little mature at times and may scare young kids. Read the Giver as soon as possible!

B005FFW46S|1.0|I am a Terry Pratchett fan, but my first attempt at reading a Discworld novel on Kindle is a disaster.  The formatting of the footnotes does not appear as in the print version and there are many editing problems.  I will stick with the tried-and-true hard-cover version for this book!  I hope that Amazon will sort out these types of problems in the future.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|I need to separate this review into content and format.  Content:  The books are (so far) amazing.  I'm about 2/3 of the way through the second book, and I'm loving them.  Interesting characters, and a lot of intrigue.  Very dark, so if you aren't into that, I wouldn't bother.  The books themselves get 4-5 stars.  Format:  Do not buy the four book bundle for Kindle.  Sure, you save about $6 over buying them separately, but it's been a bit of a headache for me, and I wouldn't recommend it.  Here's why:  * The chapters are named for characters and not numbered.  Thus, if you lose your place, you will not know which Jon [Snow] or Tyrion [Lannister] chapter you were on.  Which brings me to ...  * There is a button that sometimes gets bumped while I'm reading (I wish I could figure out which one) that will jump back to the table of contents for the FIRST book in the bundle.  When you are the equivalent of 1200 book pages in, this is quite frustrating.  Related ...  * The \\"Sync to last page read\\" function doesn't seem to work if you aren't reading the book on anything other than that single Kindle.  So if you bump that magic button and invoke its fury, you're screwed.  You have to try to remember which chapter you were reading.  This has happened to me 3-4 times now, and I've started occasionally looking at the location number of where I'm reading so I'll have a starting point when/if it happens again.   * With the four book bundle, you can never quite be sure (other than guesstimating) how far into each book you are.  This is mostly an annoyance, though.  As a side note, I've contacted Kindle support about all of it, to see what button I'm pushing to avoid it like the plague (don't really want to find out via trial and error), and to see if I can return this and put the cost toward buying the books separately.  So, in short:  Books, good; bundle for Kindle, bad.
B005I64U5C|1.0|This review will entirely focus on the \\"digital copy\\" included with this movie.  IT IS NOT A DIGITAL COPY!!  Rather the code provided allows you to watch a streaming online version of the movie via UltraViolet and Flixster.  What this means is that you can not watch it unless you download the appropriate software and have an internet connection. If you are like me and have an iPad Wi-Fi, you can not watch this \\"digital copy\\" of Green Lantern any place where you can not get a Wi-Fi connection.<br /><br />Warners better get their act together on this AND FAST, or it will be one more, and maybe their final strike.  Recently purchased copies of Thor and X-Men: First Class blu-rays included a digital copy that allowed me to download the movie from iTunes right into my iPad which can now be played anywhere without the need for an internet connection.  Funny that Warners is at a similar price point for their Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy as those other movies despite not truly providing a digital copy that the customer owns(who paid the extra $$$ for it).<br /><br />So now the only option I have for a REAL digital copy of this movie is to go out and purchase it via iTunes. Really bad marketing choice Warners, and one that I hope does not rear its ugly head on Batman: Year One later this week or you have lost one loyal customer.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Watching this movie I can't get enough. And Every time I watch it it reminds me of when the president burned Trump.
B005HXGE9G|4.0|I, for one, find this album quite beautiful. This album is far superior to the last one. Perhaps it has more to do with these songs being Peter's. Nonetheless, the results are often stunning, and quite moving. Standout for me is, San Jacinto, which is as absolutely mesmerizing as the original recording.<br /><br />Would I prefer he recorded an album of new material the way we are used to? Sure. But at this point in time, this is what Peter wants to do, and I applaud him for not compromising his artistic integrity and playing it safe to pacify his fan base.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album.

B003ZZAXFO|4.0|Not sure just how long ago it was--must have been the late '80s or thereabouts--but I have a distinct memory of Grace Slick joining daughter China as a guest VJ on MTV (I'm thinking this may have been for young China got an actual longterm gig on the network).  Now even though Grace was making hand over fist as something of a corporate rocker back in the mid-80s, fans still recognized her as the Queen of Quirk and knew that her real leanings were toward the eccentric, if not the downright bizarre.  So it probably shouldn't have been too surprising that the sole video that seemed to really impress the original Acid Queen was Peter Gabriel's provocative \\"Shock The Monkey.\\"  I have no idea if la Slick was at all familiar with Peter Gabriel's oeuvre at that point,  but she was obviously impressed by what she'd seen and heard.  If I hadn't stumbled on that particular MTV broadcast (I really DIDN'T watch it all that much),  it's doubtful I ever would have thought of Slick and Gabriel as remotely kindred spirits, but in point of fact,  their mutual penchant for accessible experimentalism and obscurantism with a beat was what made them both favorites of mine back in the day.  Not every songwriter who went for the misterioso effect back in the '60s and 70s could pull it off--the number of Bob Dylan wanna-be's who fell flat on their painted faces was close to overwhelming.  At his best, Peter Gabriel was one of a select few who succeeded in creating music that was ambitious and challenging--but which had a good beat and you could dance to it.  That may be especially true of his third solo effort--with its distinctive \\"gated drum\\" sound on a number of tracks, most notably the album's opening cut \\"Intruder,\\" on which drummer Phil Collins sounds like nothing so much as Maureen Tucker with good production values.  The clean production, in fact, enhances the relatively spare instrumentation markedly well.  This is a much different sound from his earlier work with Genesis--cleanerAND meaner than Gabriel's prog rock roots would ever have suggested.  Artistically, Peter Gabriel was growing by leaps and bounds in the early '80s.  His music was still exhiliaratingly experimental, but he was learning to wear his pretensions a bit more lightly than he did in Genesis' '70s heyday.  That said, a few of the \\"darker\\" compositions do seem to strain for significance.  I have no doubt that Gabriel had legitimate artistic reasons for attempting to be provocative and, at moments, downright disturbing but can't help detecting a kind of self-consciousness behind a song like \\"Intruder\\" or \\"Family Snapshot,\\" which are written from the perspective of criminal minds (truly deranged ones, at that).  The conceits behind such songs are just a little too obvious.  They're meant to shock.    Well, they succeed--sort of.  I doubt that--unlike Sting's equally creepy \\"Every Breath You Take\\"--anybody would mistake the intent of \\"Intruder\\" to the point of having it played at their wedding.  To that extent, you could say that Peter Gabriel succeeded where Sting and Co. did not.    I imagine there are fans who are less enamored of the overtly socially conscious Peter Gabriel represented by \\"Biko.\\"  I've never had that particular problem though.  This is straightforward political outrage, and therein lies its power.  It anticipates \\"Sun City\\" AND Paul Simon's GRACELAND in evoking African sounds and themes in ways that are both immediate and thought provoking.  You could say much the same for the somewhat more ambiguous \\"Games Without Frontiers,\\" which seems to express both cynicism (\\"if looks could kill/they probably will\\") and a kind of guarded optimism (cuz after all, this is ultimately \\"war without tears\\" and may just be a safer outlet than the kind WITH tears).  Scarely matters that the song was inspired by the British version of an international game show: it's still a knock out.  And yeah, Kate Bush's veddy British accent makes for a charming (and approriately \\"international\\") French language chorus.
1423140591|1.0|Amazon not at fault. Blame the publishers. The last 44 pages are gone!  They've been replaced with a reprint of pages 438-470.  Contacted Amazon and they are sending a new one...but days of not knowing how it ends is rather cruel!  Better to get the book at a bookstore to make sure all the pages are there!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I had this game on my Ipod and adored it more than any other mobile game I've ever played so I had no issue investing again to have it on my phone.  The game itself is 5 star but the frustration caused by losing progress after getting so far is a low blow and constant reminder which is why I sadly had to cripple the score.  I use a Samsung Epic and have been waiting months for a fix as is...hope they bother fixing it one day just collects dust now.

030788743X|5.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" is a fun book. It tells the story of a world in the near future that has lost hope, where many people can only find happiness inside a global MMORPG world known as OASIS. They interact with each other via VR goggles and haptic gloves. In this fantasy multiverse, people make friends and enemies via their avatars. Our hero is a teen named Wade (who goes by the avatar name Parzival, after Arthur's knight Parcival), who lives unhappily with his Aunt (and 10 other RV-mates), who attends the public school system that's provided in OASIS. Parzival, as he is known to everyone other than his classmates & teachers in OASIS, is a \\"gunter.\\" Gunters are OASIS players who, after the death of James Halliday (the creator of OASIS, who was obsessed with all things 1980s) and Halliday's video announcement of a world-wide quest for a secret hidden in somewhere in OASIS,  takes on the quest of finding this \\"Easter egg\\". Five years after Halliday's death and the start of the quest, Parzival is the first to find the first key to the egg. In the course of his adventures, Parzival becomes friends with several other gunters, who become co-heroes (and heroines).   There's a lot at stake in the hunt for the egg; whoever finds it first will inherit the entire fortune of  James Halliday--which is astronomical. The person who wins will have enough money to solve the worlds problems. Or take over the world. Parzival, Aech, Art3mis, and Daito & Shoto, while not a team, are united against IOI, a huge corporation with plans to win the egg and take over OASIS, making it a boring and meaningless sales pitch for itself. Through dangerous--and 80s pop culture-trivia saturated--exploits (including navigating classic video games as part of the game, not just players controlling characters on a screen; as well as battles with enemy gunters), Parzival et al get to exercise their knowledge of gaming and 80s movies, TV, music, and culture to solve puzzles and go further into the maze of theegg hunt.   I really enjoyed reading \\"Ready Player One.\\" The characters are dynamic and the plot, while not 100% original (multiverses and video game plots aren't new), is a fun twist. The ending was satisfying; the players have learned important lessons through their adventures and have grown as a result. The message of the book is a good one: it's fun to immerse yourself in virtual worlds, but it's a mistake to avoid living your real life in so doing. If you're looking for a book that's fun, well written, and thought-provoking, \\"Ready Player One\\" is a good choice.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very soothing music, puzzles that are just challenging enough to take you away from it all for a few minutes. Nice app,well worth the price!
B005UKJZ10|1.0|well that was a big waste of my time...I get it and it was just lousy...not entertaining at all...felt like this was a movie made just to torture students required to explain what it all meant...
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Finally a chess game I understand. All the pieces look the same as to eliminate the irksome need to remember which piece is what. I basically play it like checkers. 5 stars!
B005UKJX4E|1.0|This was a huge disappointment.  Very surprised two of our finest actors would be in a piece of trash like this. The nature photography was nice, but it wasn't what I was expecting at all from this film.  The music was just loud, got really tired of adjusting my sound up and down. Reading the reviews of this movie was more interesting than the actual movie.
1449408656|4.0|Great book for cat lovers!  Very amusing!  I had never read the blog before which I have now signed up for.  This is a great gift book for any cat lover.  It is the type of book that you can read over and over and never tire of....if you are a cat lover!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am a huge book reader and I never write reviews but this book is by far, hands down, one of the best books I have ever read. It is gritty and heartfelt. It is real on so many levels and yet has a feel of excitement. I want to devour this book over and over again. I have read it three or four times and it never gets old.   This is not a typical girl meets boy and they fall blissfully in love story. This is fully of trials and tribulations. It is about finding that one person that speaks to you on a whole level that can't be explained or denied. This book is about letting go of past hurts and the willingness to take risks for something you believe in.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I love it! I love this author! I can only hold my breath until a company gets smart enough to have this book come out in print!
B004LWZW42|5.0|It was great to finally know how the stories' main characters (X-MEN) all first met, their origins, how they came together, and when and where their lines of allegiance to each other divided; one side led by hatred and fear, the other, compassion and a plea for acceptance for the world.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I have to say, 9 out of 10 movies these days are pathetic. I'm still surprised (albeit foolishly, because James Cameron's obviously not a director to compare others to) that I loved this movie this much. Such a great storyline and yada yada yada... you know the rest. If you didn't hear about all the reviews, awards, Emmy's & Grammies this baby took home, then crawl out from under the rock you've been hiding because this was one of the better modern-day movies to date. Sweet film, truly.
B005NA3B8U|3.0|I bought this game because I used to LOVE it as a stand-up, coin-op arcade game.  Could spend hours playing it over and over.  Got blisters from the joystick.  And that's what I miss most with this version: the joystick.  Fingers on the touchscreen obscure much of the gameplay, causing a lot of ship explosions, especially when attacked from behind.  Ship control is imprecise, often resulting in missed power-ups, missed targets, or -uh oh - explosions.  I'd love to say it's better and give it a higher rank, but even three stars is mostly for nostalgic reasons.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I am really hooked on this series!  It has lots of great characters and a plot that moves along quickly!  Each episode keeps my interest throughout.  I highly recommend this DVD set!
B004EPZ07U|1.0|The package says in big letters \\"Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy\\" on the top of the package.  What you get is a DVD, an extended cut Blu-Ray, and permission to STREAM a digital copy of the mediocre movie Ultraviolet.  Ultraviolet only got a 9% on the Rottentomatoes.com web site.  You get to stream it to your home unit, you don't even get a digital copy of the cheesy second choice.  Amazon is good enough to list it as a Blu-ray/DVD/Ultraviolet digital copy, but If you want Blu-ray, get the just Blu-ray copy, or just get the DVD.  WB should be ashamed of this marketing ploy
B0058VW36U|4.0|I love this app...so much fun!! but it constantly is crashing after i play for a period of time. Then after it crashes it resets my phone wallpaper! its an easy fix and it always saves my progress but i would like that problem to be fixed. other than that the apps great! (Review given by my 15 year old daughter)
B004EPZ07U|1.0|this ultra voilet digital copy crap isnt something im interested in at all.  i put my digital copies in iTunes because its convenient for ME. i do NOT care what any other company wants or that they dont like apple or whatever the issue is.  i dont use the \\"cloud\\" either its all bs if you ask me.  just give us our regular digital copies and stop trying to make us sign up for extra stuff we dont want ffs.
B00008K79Q|4.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence, 2002 film     This movie is set in Australia around 1930 when half-caste Aboriginal children were forcibly removed and sent to government boarding schools for an education that would remove them from their stone-age lives. Three girls escaped to walk back to their mother, nearly a thousand miles. They were guided by the rabbit-proof fence that runs across Australia to control migrating rabbits. A native tracker is sent after them, but the girls know how to avoid leaving a trail (walking in streams). Some people help them with food or a warm coat. In time one of the girls is caught, but the other two succeed in returning to their mother.  This story moves slowly at times, but it presents a recreation of rural Australia from the past. Something similar went on in America for the schooling of native American children in schools that removed them from their families. But you won't see a movie about that. Sending children away to school was also used by the ruling classes of England and America at that time, and to this day. How to give children a modern education is an ongoing problem for all today.  Were rabbits native to Australia? If they were brought by English settlers, then escaped into the wild to become a pest, it would be a warning against invasive species When predators are eliminated their prey increases. NJ has a problem with black bears after the destruction of family farms and hunting, and the spread of suburban living.

B0057FWSQ2|5.0|Patti Smith is a poet.  A singer.  A revolutionary.  An icon.  Every note she sings and every word she writes is loaded with so much meaning the listener is left with the feeling that she/he must do something.  Laugh, scream, cry, speak out- it doesn't matter what you do, just do it.  She is an artist that incites rebellion and introspection at the same time, and every album is filled with stories of where and who she was at that time, leaving one the feeling of having just read Smith's diary in a most public way.  She is the embodiment of personal as political.  That being said, Outside Society had to be a difficult undertaking for Smith.  To pare down a life's work to 18 songs, and still maintain integrity, hardly seems possible in the case of such a prolific artist.  She has, of course, accomplished just that-because she is Patti Smith, superwoman for who all things are possible.  Although the album seems somewhat scattered and disjointed, it really is a great snapshot and showcase of her work. Outside Society could just as easily be called 'Patti Smith for Dummies,' with its chronological exploration of the most listener-friendly songs in Smith's collection.  This is by no means a bad thing; it is just not for anyone already familiar with her work.  It is an album complete with the songs that started it all, such as \\"Gloria,\\" and \\"Dancing Barefoot,\\" as well as her most famous radio hit (on which she collaborated with Bruce Springsteen) \\"Because the Night.\\"  Also included in the compilation are her renditions of Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" and Roger McGuinn's \\"So You Wanna Be a Rock Star.\\"  Although Smith is nothing but original herself, she has become recognized as an artist who honors what others' songs mean to her by covering them with the utmost respect.  Outside Society is not for the person who has followed Smith through her life's journey, or anyone who jumped on board along the way.  However, it is a succinct introduction for someone who is not familiar with her work but wishes to get one's feet wet, and it is sure to lead to immersing oneself further into the world of Patti Smith.  So, jump in, listen, and get caught in the wave.
0393338827|4.0|Good insights into the subprime crisis - who made/lost money and \\"especially\\" how. Good insights into the hedge fund world.

B005EVVEPK|4.0|While listening to Veronica falls, the newest British import, one may find themselves feeling as though Throwing Muses or The Pixies have created another spinoff. Though obviously influenced by, and giving nods to, indie groups from the 1980s and 90s, this band is still very original in what they deliver. With so many bands trying to vie for notice in the indie-pop-punk meets ambient scene, Veronica Falls is a standout.  They deliver beautiful harmonies, spot-on instrumentation, and slightly dark lyrics, sounding somewhat like Mazzy Star, but with a more upbeat undertone. The songs take us on a melodramatic journey through teenage tragedy, lurking depression, and dark hearts, all while leaving us feeling oddly upbeat about it all. While singing about how they \\"Found Love In a Graveyard,\\" you may find yourself feeling oddly happy- because they did find love. They make \\"Misery\\" and having a \\"Bad Feeling\\" seem more than bearable. With the progression of each of their songs, they bring the listener farther into their world, which is slightly dark, but mostly dreamy.  Veronica Falls is an album that should be not be ignored, but rather put on rotation for quite a while.  They are masters of making the macabre seem seductive and even joyful. So, the next time you feel like grave dancing or chasing shadows, invite Veronica Falls along, because they will show you the unexpected joy in the darkness.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I have been waiting for a good checkers game to be the free app of the day for a while now. Thank You! Works perfectly on DROID X.  Love the feature that takes you to other classics like backgammon and reversi. :-)
B005I64U5C|4.0|I liked the movie, but.... Just a warning to everyone, like myself, who watches the digital copies.  Ultraviolet's version of a \\"Digital Copy\\" is not what you expect it is only a streaming copy of the movie, you cannot just transfer it to your iPhone or iPad, plus they force your to load both Flixster and Ultraviolet before it lets you download the movie to your hard drive (that you can't watch from your portable device even though it takes up the space).  Personally this is a rip-off as any other digital copy gives me an actual digital copy.  If I wanted a streaming copy of the movie I would use Netflix or Amazon's service.
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|Good game. Nice graphics, nice play. But playing against the computer gets old and two players on one phone is not a great option (though it probably works fine on a 10 inch tablet).<br /><br />So what this game really needs to be a 5 star game is the ability to find competitors through the network who have the game and be able to play against them (like words with friends). that would make this a great game.<br /><br />PS - I'm still laughing about the one reviewer not knowing the difference between checkers and chess.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Got this for Christmas for my kid. It's frustrating, if you don't concentrate.  Seems challenging too!  We have the original perplexus, this is more difficult.  Buy this For older kids.  Mine is 12.  If your child likes toys that give immediate results, this is not for them.  It takes practice to complete iy!  This item did not arrive by the specified date on my order!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|This is one of the best hard rock CDs I've heard in a very long time.   Far better than the first disc.   There is a version with a CD/DVD package, but I bought the CD only and found a serious rocker bonus track, not listed on the liner and from what I hear, NOT included if you buy the CD/DVD package.   The band is very diverse on this with rockers, cranking hard rockers and some lighter rockers and ballads. Hagar is at the top of his game. Everyone is and standing out individually while creating an open quality band statement on each track.  Three and half letters is a very powerful (words and music) rockin' piece.  No Change, the unlisted bonus track just absolutely rocks full tilt.  I've only heard the whole disc twice, but in will be my driving disc for a long time. I hope the radio catches on to this.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Went to see this the weekend it came out. My wife and I loved it. They took the origninal film and added to it. More humour, better story telling.. Fantastic. This is a must have. I hope it will be released in time for Christmas, as my wife promptly told me exiting the cinema its on her Christmas list..
B000SEH80I|5.0|I was a little sceptical when I bought this book, thinking \\"is this REALLY going to help, or is it just another self-help book?\\" This book brought on flurries of different emotions: anger, saddness, depression etc, but in the end gave me the strength to realize just how bad things were when I was growing up and how they haven't changed at all now that I'm an adult. At this time I'm no longer speaking to my parents or sister and I've never felt stronger or more secure as a person. I urge everyone to read this one, it's well worth it!!
B005DKLPF6|2.0|After liking all the other albums, this was a huge let down. I didnt like this album at all, and to each his own, I am sure the band is proud and should be its great playing, but the songs are boring and almost seem to be trying to hard to please, to sell or to sell out?
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Like a lot of artists of Peter Gabriel's vintage he is repackaging past music but unlike the other repackagers this one is very interesting. With almost no drums and no guitars the music has a very cinematic quality. It is also has a very creepy vibe to it.  There is just something about it that draws me in. I have had it less than a week and have listen to it three times. Don't know if everyone will like it but for me it is 5 stars.
B002ZG994U|5.0|I watched the series growing up and I always loved the way the A Team always managed to pull it all together using a paper clip and a bundle of twine, allowing Hannibal to puff on a fresh stogie and utter his iconic line \\" I love it when a plan comes together!\\"<br /><br />Because I had always enjoyed the series I was a bit leary of the movie because often times the translation from small screen to big screen doesn't work well and it leaves you either scratching your head to find any sort of similiarity or it's so badly done that you want the run time back on your life clock.<br /><br />This movie did neither.  It was true to the essence of the series with some great background information about how the team came to be formed and why they were so loyal to each other, and then they went out and did what the A Team did best.<br /><br />This time, however, they budget was bigger and the special effects were awesome!  There was action, a little romance, alot of humor thanks to the Murdock character and cameo appearances by the original Murdock and Face from the TV series.<br /><br />It was a great action movie because it stayed true to the spirit of the series without trying to recreate it verbatim.  The special effects were great without dominating the storyline which was great and kept shifting so you were on your toes.<br /><br />I think that because Stephen J. Cannell was involved in this movie it kept it true true to the original flavor of the series and it made for an awesome and entertaining movie from start to finish.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the next installment in this franchise because Liam Neeson, Bradley Cooper and the rest of the new A Team cast were phenomenal in bringing the characters to life.<br /><br />I just hope that since Mr. Cannell has passed away that they will be able to maintain the integrity and the level of the story telling that made this first movie and the series such great entertainment.

I'm sure I'll be paying for the non-ad versions VERY soon. Some levels take some time to figure out, but I think that's why they're so popular! They work fine on my Atrix.
0440245931|5.0|Suspenseful, Thrilling. The Pelican Brief delights the senses for a reader. Impossible to stop reading. Every page is a new dire situation. I can see why they make John Grisham's books into movies and speedily, although this read was without a doubt better than what was put up on the silver screen. This Author has what it takes to draw in his fans.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I really cannot understand why this Cd has been reviewed so highly by critics and so poorly by customers. Well, I have to agree with the critics: This is a great album, some of Bjork's best, and one of the only modern music that is worthy of some attention. All tracks are masterpieces. Moon is minimalistic, but is all about Bjork's voice. The other stand-outs are, in my opinion: Cosmogony, Mutual Core and Sacrifice. All great. I hope the rating gets higher with time. Admittedly, as it often happens with Bjork, this album needs time to grow, but when it does, it becomes wonderful.
B005MVIF7M|5.0|Good music but why does the Mp3 site not have the 4 extra song that can be bought with the cd, particularly when you can buy the 4 songs individually  as MP3s if you go to the CD store? I might understand this disconnect if it was unknown band, but Amazon made a point of featuring Wilco just prior to the new  album coming out.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|This product works as expected on the iPod Touch 4th Gen. However, some apps do not support TV Out.  Obviously, It will not work with these apps. You only get audio out in this case. In reading the reviews it was not obvious  that you needed a 4th generation device to use this cable.  A quick check of the online Apple documentation confirms that it only works with a 4th Gen device. The older devices support TV out using a different cable with a composite video connector.  It displays natively in 720 X 1280 @ 60 Hz on the iPod 4.  But then again the resolution of the source material is a factor.  This should be plenty good for most users to watch movies or TV shows on their home HDTVs. As like all Apple products the quality is 1st class.

0307272702|5.0|After reading this book, I FINALLY understand why decades of following dietary guides offered by the FDA and others who promote a low-fat/low protein diet NEVER worked for me.  I FINALLY understand why spending hours at the gym each week doing cardio and weight training, while eating low-fat/low protein portion controlled diets didn't result in weight-loss.  After reading this book I now realize that simply cutting out sugar is not enough for MY body to lose fat: I must also eliminate most fruits from my diet if I want to shed fat.  And after reading this book, I have a completely different understanding about cholesterol issues -- both medical and dietary.  What I read makes me disgusted about the lies we are told about nutrition and health by \\"experts\\" that are supposed to have our best interests at heart.
1423140591|5.0|The Son of Neptune is the much-awaited sequel to The Lost Hero; I know I've been waiting for it since I heard the preview last May. So you can imagine just how excited I was to run over to my favorite Barnes & Noble and get my copy on the day it came out.<br /><br />As always, Rick Riordan manages to completely astound me with his cleverly written stories. He's got an uncanny knack for weaving elements of mythology with real life, as well as bringing into existence characters that I truly end up caring for. The Son of Neptune is a brilliant second book for The Heroes of Olympus series, working well as a standalone story, while leaving enough room for the next book (or two or three) in the series.<br /><br />With The Son of Neptune, I was already aware that Percy would be our main protagonist once again, and that he would, of course, remember nothing of his old life and friends from Camp Half Blood. I've always admired Percy's character (since the Percy Jackson days), and it was kind of fun watching him grow a little more as he encounters new friends, foes and even locations in this new life Riordan writes for him.<br /><br />I loved getting to know the two new characters though, Hazel and Frank. Both characters are flawed, riddled with their own insecurities, secrets and longings. But they both also possess amazing (and quite stunning) abilities that come into play quite often during the course of their quest. It's quite heartwarming to get to know them, watch them mature and experience their crazy (and it really was a crazy one!) quest with them.<br /><br />Apart from them, there are a great many interesting secondary characters - Reyna, Hylla, Arion and Ella being among my favorites. And, best of all, some of our beloved friends from the Percy Jackson series (and The Lost Hero) return in this book as well, if only as minor players.<br /><br />Not only that, but we go on the most amazing journey and see some cool new locations - the Roman camp that Jason refers to in the first book of the series and the state of Alaska, which is an interesting bit of the book, if I do say so myself.<br /><br />Again with the crazy twists and turns - this book has a whole slew of them! I seriously could not stop my mouth from falling open when I read certain bits or put things together in my head. Plus, as a bonus, a lot of moments had me laughing out loud too! I still consider Riordan brilliant at cobbling his story into a cohesive whole and I can't wait to see where he takes us next with this series.Alaska, which is an interesting bit of the book, if I do say so myself.

B004LROMSO|1.0|This could have been a great series, there are some good actors (noteably the Merlin character), but the program uses the legend of Camalot to tell a series of cliche modern morality tales.
B005MP28B2|1.0|This film wasted about 20 minutes by stealing NASA, Nature, etc. images along with some cheap Jurassic Park special effects. Please Hollywood stick to what you do best, which is making mostly shallow but often entertaining films, and not trying to give your cheap and overly obvious perspective on the meaning of life. Just laughable. Great tales on the meaning of life are told subtly in the context of a story about living life. This may have been possible if the director had done more to develop and tell the story of this family. The problem though is that a good portion of the film is wasted on pointless images of space and nature, which has nothing to do with the story that only just begins to develop in the second part of the film. Also, this is an example of a hole in Amazon's rating system. The distribution is bimodal meaning you will most likely either hate it or love it, so taking average doesn't accurately describe the rating distribution for this film.  If you are a person who appreciates a good story that gives you some subtle insights on the meaning of life then you will most likely be disappointed by this film. Others will like it simply for the reason that it is wackily and disjointedly different. If you do decide to watch it be warned and hope you are part of the \\"love it\\" group.
1597801577|5.0|I generally agree with the reviews posted so far for the Windup Girl. The story is slow to start, and you have to drag yourself through some uncharted territory before any of it starts to make sense. But when it does, its true, its raw and its fresh. Maybe not so polished - but authentic. Maybe not easy to access - but every new world needs to endure some pains of creation. And this new world takes the best from many know themes - the sad cyborg philosophy of Ghost In The Shell, the nervousness of the resource crisis we face today on Earth, the lawless feel of the good 60ties westerns, and twists it all into solid science fiction.  Being a Iain M Banks man myself with a lot of love for grand space operas and far-far future, this was the first dystopian story that i really liked. Another fact that shows its strength - breaking any walls of prejudice you might have and making you like something new, something just invented.   My only regret is that i did not read this book while i was discovering Bangkok last year - a perfectly overheated, messy scifi story to accompany you in the wicked city.
1594481717|3.0|I got the unabridged audiobook.  This book is a philosophical read only.  It gives you plenty to think about but is not  a self-help book with a GPS to utopia.  Some parts will resonate, while other parts will cause a Spock-like raising of the eyebrow.  One example is when he discusses \\"laughing clubs\\".  I have heard of these and knew people that had bosses who did this.  I find these laughing clubs...well....laughable.  If you are a right-brained artist hoping for a book that will tell you how to earn a successful living, this is not it.  If you enjoy the challenge of hearing other viewpoints, then you may enjoy this book and even learn a few things.<br /><br />The author is  articulate and easy to listen to if you choose to get the audio.

B005J7K950|5.0|This past Friday, our local \\"art house\\" theater presented Metropolis.  I mistakenly thought it was the extensively restored version that Kino bills as \\"The Complete Metropolis,\\" but it wasn't until I was seated that someone told me this was the Moroder version.<br /><br />At first I was disappointed, until the film actually started.  As it played, my mouth fell open in amazement at how well Moroder's \\"contemporary\\" synthesized soundtrack undergirded the film's story and visuals.  I actually found myself really, really \\"digging\\" the psychological effect of watching an 84-year-old silent classic married to a contemporary soundtrack.<br /><br />Of course, there are spots where some of the other contributors' work doesn't really mesh well with the film, and it's in these spots that the presentation gets ham-strung.  But the parts that Moroder composed for the film are spot-on and have to be experienced to be appreciated.  Especially in the opening sequences of the film, as the laborers are going through the shift change, the emotion conveyed in Moroder's score fits so well to the visuals that words fail me to describe its effect.<br /><br />I don't often use the term \\"genius\\" when describing anything in this day and age, but in the case of Giorgio Moroder's vision of Metropolis, genius is the only fitting appellation that can be applied.
B005529BDK|3.0|It's a game that's good in short spurts.  but it needs more...unlockable content and/or a story/campaign mode maybe.  It's a good start.  This could be something really amazing with more content.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|\\"My Stroke of Insight\\" is a fascinating book about what happens to your brain when you have a stroke from a first-person perspective.  It helps to explain why many stroke victims do not dial 999 (the left side of the brain sees the phone but does not recognize what it is for).  The fact that the stroke happened to a brain specialist adds medical authenticity to her comments.  It is amazing that the author was eventually able to recover from her major stroke to return to an essentially normal life and to write a book about her experiences.  I have recommended it to a number of friends and bought a copy for a relative.

0545259088|5.0|Kudos to Maggie Stiefvater for giving us a final offering in this series that is as wonderful as the first two books.  Please understand, young readers, that the building of suspense takes time.  More importantly--much more importantly--the building of the reader's connection to character also takes time.  Siefvater is a master in this, and a master in creating prose that is fluid--whether it is lilting and graceful or hard-edged and savage.<br /><br />I think I will miss Beck forever.<br /><br />I never, ever would have read a werewolf series had I known the nature of this book before getting it for review.  When I realized what I was in for, I loved the writing so much that I decided to keep an open mind and give it a fair chance.  I ordered the first two books in the series, read them in a few days--and was thankful I had Forever already so that I could jump right into the finale.  This last book is as wonderfully poignant as the first two.<br /><br />As a teacher of high school English, I am constantly looking for YA books that are literary in nature, not just a good story.  I know my good-story-loving students will devour these books... and probably \\"borrow\\" them without returning them... which is always the highest compliment to a book, I think.
081297381X|5.0|If you like to think you know anything do not read this book, or else you will end up clueless. This book brings about true skepticisms on things that are ignored or taken for granted. It's a highly recommended eye opening experience. Death to the \\"bell curve\\".
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is an awesome game that reminds me of the old years of role playing where the stories were elaborate and the game play in depth because art and \\"flash\\" were not so advanced.

B0010SEMP0|5.0|I loved this book!!! From page one, the action, adventure, suspense, and romance jumped off the page and kept me engaged. Cat and Bones have such on-page chemistry that you just can't help but to them root them on.<br /><br />Cat, saucy, sexy, sarcastic, and strong-willed, was an exemplary heroine. I loved her one- liners. I truly laughed out loud when she said Annette was like \\"Martha Stewart on crack cocaine.\\" Literary genius, Ms. Frost :).<br /><br />And Bones...are there any words needed to describe Bones. He is THE alpha male of alpha males. Dominant, strong, decisive, and gentle.  He stood in front, beside, and behind Cat throughout the entire book. He was loving and protective but supportive in everything she did...including dealing with her harpy of a mother *shiver*.<br /><br />This was truly a very enjoyable read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The perfect game. Simplicity and challenging at its best. Smooth game play and excellent graphics make this game worth five stars.

193413712X|4.0|George Washington Crosby is dying.<br /><br />George is laying on a bed, which has been pulled into the living room of his New England home. He is surrounded by his sister, wife, children, and grandchildren.<br /><br />In a humble living space, George's family is keeping vigil at the bedside of their dying patriarch. It is a scene that evokes Edvard Munch's painting, \\"Death in a Sickroom\\".<br /><br />The grief and mortality in the room is palpable. As George dies, his mind slips into and out of a dream world- awash with memories of an impoverished childhood in West Cove, Maine, and of his own life as a father and clock tinkerer.<br /><br />In George's dreamworld, the influence of magical realists, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, on Harding's prose is evident. Harding, though, manages to make these inflections of Marquez and others his own. His prose is firmly-rooted in an American, New England landscape and domestic world that Harding can claim as his.<br /><br />Across this short book, the reader is escorted into and out of George's living room, back into the past, into George's memories of his epileptic, poetic, imperfect but loving father, Howard, and into George's life as a clock repairman, dedicated husband, and father.<br /><br />While short, this book is full of meaning and unexpected depth, like a packet of frozen phyllo dough. For with each new layer of meaning you peel back, you'll be amazed that more and more layers can exist underneath the one at hand, and that so many layers exist within the confines of such an unimposing package.<br /><br />\\"Eighty-four hours before he died...\\" goes the narration. \\"Seventy two hours before George died...\\"<br /><br />Harding, opening paragraphs in this way throughout this novel, provides a narrative backbone to his novel, a thread of constancy to anchor the fluttering, wandering streaks of George's more unconscious remembrances.<br /><br />These sentences, which appear with each new passing of a half-day or full day, smack the mind like a morning alarm clock. They are a chilling reminder of time's ceaseless march, of the inevitable \\"fading away\\" of us all.<br /><br />In the face of these lines, all the heavy lifting that Harding's magical prose has done in this novel to twist, expand, extend, and distort time partially collapses under the weight of this reality: George is dying. And he is dying soon.<br /><br />When my wife saw \\"Tinkers\\" on my bedside table, and read the book's back cover, she said, \\"Well, that looks like a real uplifting book,\\" in a heavy tone of sarcasm.<br /><br />I suppose any book that deals in the dark realms of  death and loss is not \\"easy\\" reading. But I find the themes of this book and others like it, and the deft touch with which Harding handles this weighty topic, anything but depressing.<br /><br />Harding's meditation of time and life is uplifting in the same way as Seneca's \\"Letters from a Stoic,\\" or Joan Didion's \\"A Magical Year of Thinking\\".<br /><br />Harding, in writing about death, family, love, and loss, demonstrates, with aplomb and craftsmanship, in this debut novel that- only through contemplating death, and our own mortality, can we realize the closest thing to immortality that humans have ever been able to achieve.<br /><br />By thinking and reading and facing the reality of our mortality head on, Harding's novel seems to be saying, can readers, however ephemerally, realize a way to slow the steady march of time and their own \\"fading away\\".

B003UD7JEE|5.0|Since he created the storyline back in 1990, the Luc Besson story of the young woman being converted into an assasin has had four treatments--Besson's own \\"La Femme Nikita\\", the Bridget Fonda vehicle known alternately as \\"The Assassin\\" and \\"The Point Of No Return\\" in 1992, the USA Network series of the late 1990s that starred Peta Wilson, and \\"Alias\\", which drew from the \\"Nikita\\" storyline in its five-year run.  Warner Brothers has loved the storyline, which is why it now gets its third treatment, this time on the CW.    I mentioned \\"Alias\\" in the opening paragraph because, as the Jennifer Garner series drew from the \\"Nikita\\" legend, this version of the \\"Nikita\\" tale draws both from \\"Alias\\" and its television predecessor.  One could see this version drawing from the Peta Wilson series as sort of a continuation of the story it started back in the day, but the core motivation of this Nikita--to destroy the rogue black ops unit; \\"Division\\" in this piece because of the murder of her lover--draws from Sydney Bristow's desire to destroy SD6 in \\"Alias\\"; with the protagonists even having their deceased lovers both named Daniel.    This iteration of \\"Nikita\\" also follows \\"Alias\\" much more in terms of action--with 20/20 hindsight, \\"LFN\\" seems a precursor in terms of style and posing to \\"The Matrix\\".      Of course, what really makes this version of the Nikita story take off...is Margaret Denise Quigley.    If I start off by saying that Maggie Q is gorgeous, here's the reaction I would expect--    \\"You got THAT right...\\"    \\"Oh, really??!?  I didn't notice...\\"    \\"Well, DUH...\\"    The fact that Maggie brings the action chops along with her beauty--she's a younger version of the great Michelle Yeoh in many ways--cannot be dismissed when this series is discussed.  She knows what she's doing in the action sequences, which adds to the watchability of the episodes.    The supporting cast is very good.  Shane West's Michael is surly, mean, and a professional; stuck between his duty to Division and his attraction to Nikita.  Melinda Clarke's Amanda--the psychological operations specialist--is handled well, Clarke bringing some of her iciness and control from her \\"Lady Heather\\" character from \\"CSI\\" to Amanda.  Aaron Sanford's Birkoff is much more fun and snarky than Matthew Ferguson's take on the character from the USA series.  Because so much of this series happens within the training areas of Division, the two students--Ashton Holmes' hard-charging Thom and Tiffany Hines' unstable Jaden--are key in the season.  There cannot be enough said about Xander Berkeley's Percy, other than to call him \\"Arvin Sloane on steroids\\".  There is NO pretense of loyalty with Percy, and the snarl that Berkeley gives to him is done without quarter.    This leads me to the key performance and character of the first season--Lyndsy Fonseca, and her turn as Nikita's friend/student/mole within Division, Alex.  Many of us know Fonseca as the nerdgasm from \\"Hot Tub Time Machine\\" or \\"Kick-Ass\\", obviously lighter fare.  The addition of Alex, and getting her placed within Division, initially starts off as an added part of Nikita's attempt to destroy the organization, but as the season goes on, we realize that there is more here--specifically, WHY Nikita chose Alex, and who Alex is, and her own relation to the sordid history of Division--especially Nikita's own past within Division.  In many ways, Alex's story becomes more intriguing to the season than what we consider the primary story.  It is an interesting and far more complicated load that Fonseca has ever had to carry, and Lyndsy pulls it off very well.    Season 1 is very much an establishment of the two storylines and draws the lines in this battle--Nikita wanting Michael to help her bring down Division and his wavering between loyalty to Division and aiding Nikita, Nikita's loose group of people aiding her--the rogue \\"Guardian\\" Owen (Devon Sawa), the low-level CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean)...and Percy's designated hitman, the \\"Cleaner\\" only known as Roan (Rob Stewart, considerably cleaned up and toned down from his \\"Sweating Bullets\\" days).    The guest turns here don't have a lot of big names--there is Ray Park's turn as a Guardian in \\"Into The Box\\", and seeing the long-time martial-arts artist and actor ply his craft here is a treat.  But the interesting casting comes in the season finale, \\"Pandora\\", which upsets the apple cart in setting up the storyline for Season Two.  The veteran actor Harris Yulin portrays a member of \\"Oversight\\"--which controls (supposedly) Division--but more interesting is the casting of Alberta Watson to play another member of Oversight, Madeline.  For those who remember the cast of \\"La Femme Nikita\\" from the USA Network, Watson played the director of psychological ops in the Peta Wilson-led series...and yes, her character was named \\"Madeline\\".  One wonders if Danny Cannon and Craig Silverstein will play on this connection as the series continues.    This take on the \\"Nikita\\" story is much more action driven, certainly closer to its \\"Alias\\" cousin in that regard than any of the true \\"Nikita\\" predecessors.  Maggie Q and Lyndsy Fonseca make it easy on the eyes to watch, but having McG directing the action--and Maggie's considerable skill in the action sequences--makes this series a kick.  Add in the subtle complications of the storyline, and the CW has a winner.    Highly recommended.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|Released in 1989, Tim Burton's Batman holds up very well 22 years after its release and I actually prefer it over Christopher Nolan's re-entry, as interesting as his vision is. As for Joel Schumaker's stunning though at times silly vision of Batman, I try to forget about those films. Burton's first Batman is pure escapism in a sort of old fashion way. No CGI to be seen here and it works better that way. It's no surprise to me that Burton's Batman has been compared to Citizen Kane (1941) or The Maltese Falcon (1941), Burton and production designer Anton Furst take you into a dark world filled with crime and also mystery. Other films at the time such as Blade Runner (1982) and Brazil (1985) had already experimented with the classic film noir style, done in a sort of retro/futuristic way but Anton Furst's design for Gothem City truly feels like you are viewing a modern retelling of the classic noir films from the 40s.<br /><br />Sam Hamm's script is solid and while it has been the target for criticism, I feel that he did a nice job, his dialog is very witty at times and a little over the top but it's appropriate, particularly with Jack Napiar/ The Joker. The performances are actually quite impressive and even better then what Chris Nolan got out of his actors but that's just an opinion. Micheal Keaton, while controversial and unusual at the time, gives a really good performance, he is very shy and sensitive which is the Bruce Wayne that I respond to the most. Jack Nicholson really needs no analysis for his work here, he is just perfect that putting into words is pointless. His joker is fun and even believable, Jack is just as great of an actor as James Cagney in my mind. Kim Basinger is actually much better then she is given credit for, her and Keaton work well together. The rest of the cast really are supporting characters, some are familiar to the Batman story, some are new. One of them being Alexander Knox. Robert Wahl plays a very likable guy who the other characters have a hard time taking seriously. His eagerness to find Batman and win his Pulitzer prize is well done and is a very down to earth performance, which I guess is what the movie needed.<br /><br />As for Tim Burton's direction, he handles the actors very well and as for the technical work, I have mixed feelings about that. A lot of moments have really well choreographed camera work but there are a couple of zoom in shots that I felt were sloppy and a little unnecessary. There are a couple of matte painting shots that may not hold up as well today but none of this really matters, it still works. Of course, Danny Elfman's score left me speechless. He combines the fun, the adventurous and the dark side of Batman into one piece. I recommend buying the soundtrack with Elfman's score on it, it's amazing!! I think that Batman may be the best Hollywood movie of the late 80s and I still consider it a favorite from my childhood. I know that comic book purists prefer Nolan's Batman but as just a movie guy who loves old fashion Hollywood movies, this one appeals more to my taste. Batman deserves its comparison with Citizen Kane or any other Hollywood masterpiece as far as I'm concerned, even Casablanca (1942) or The Godfather (1972). Burton's 1992 sequel, Batman Returns is equally as great and even takes the series in a direction that's more complex and provoking which Joel Shumaker ignored. While Christopher Nolan's Batman films have stolen the popularity of Burton's, I would argue that his will go down in history as Hollywood classics.a hard time taking seriously.

B000023VR6|5.0|plain and simple this is just a great album, this is my 5th to 6th time purchaseing due to kids and others seem tp walk off with it. while i dont enjoy to much of the new rapp due to language and the beats mostly the same just reconfig a bit. the language here doesnt bother me due to the great sound and lyrics. what i realy enjoy is its just not bass. you get all sorts of highs and mids and bass mixture. If you have a good system this will only make others wanting to check your system out. Im 46 and get stopped by the youth always wanting to check my sh... out. they think their jammin till i pull up. makes an old man not feel so old,haha. keep jammin all. i will till the end.

B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and though not usually award winning writing I can always count on well developed characters and a good story.  With this book it just seemed like he gave up.  It was like Sparks took chapters from his other books that were edited out and put them together into this one.  It was extremely predictable and boring.

B001DD0DCI|5.0|Please ignore comments that say this bluray/dvd leaves out the first five minutes of the movie. The immediate intro to the nightclub scene was how it was shown in theatres, it's a cool start and it's the version which I prefer. This is the theatrical version  The unrated directors cut has lots of cheesy phil collins music toward the end and has a much more commercial feel, probably done to pacify critics who thought the movie was not enough like the TV series  This version is gritty and dark but still has plenty of Miami Vice references from various episodes for true MV fans to recognize. For example I do not get the reviewer below who does not understand why Tubbs is protective toward a prostitute at the start of the movie - Tubbs is frequently protective of women, especially escorts etc in the TV series. The bomb sequence and trips to Columbia are also pulled straight from the TV shows  The biggest omission for me by far in this movie is Jan Hammer, it was a very costly decision not to use him as a composer especially with the popularity of retro synths/electronica right now. It would've really helped people feel like they were watching Miami Vice despite the modern setting. Definitely an opportunity missed but otherwise an excellent movie and vastly underrated

0802724981|3.0|Over all a good book. I liked the part about overcoming difficulties as a means for achieving maturity.  However, his idea that an open marriage is healthy, and that a therapist under certain circumstances could have sexual relations with a patient is somewhat disturbing. I also found that his theological ideas are somewhat biased toward evangelicalism and his theology somewhat shallow.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|My wife & I watched all 6 seasons (about 120 episodes in 8 weeks). You get addicted pretty quickly.  Lots of emotions, lots of cliff hangers, it forces your brain to work like putting pieces of a puzzle together - and yet enjoy it all.  The actors selected, the writing, the directing, the music are perfect!!  We purchased each individual season at the same time because the Complete Box Series had not been released.  The Extra's are included on the last disc at the end of each season, which totals about 12 hours from all 6 seasons.  Just wondering, does the Lost Complete Box Series - HD or DVD, include more Extra viewing verses what was included on the individual box series?

B0041928UG|4.0|Critics of Bonfire of the Vanities often say that Wolfe's epic novel is not \\"literary\\" or \\"high brow\\" enough to go down in the literary canon.  I can see where these reviewers are coming from, but that does not make this novel any less entertaining.  The difference between Wolfe, as opposed to an author like Jonathan Franzen, is that Franzen's novels are reflective of the psyches and personalities that make up middle-America -- essentially, Franzen has something to say about our society.  Wolfe, at least to me, is more focused on telling a good story.<br /><br />Not that there is anything wrong with that.  While Wolfe perhaps has something to say about race and socioeconomic relations (essentially, that the rich folks on Wall Street kind of jerks and poor minorities on the street are not all that bad), Bonfire of the Vanities is more an exercise in style and pacing.  It is a testament to Wolfe's structuring ability that a book this lengthy (my hardcover is over 600 pages) never feels too long-winded.  This book will not change your life or the way you look at things -- it will, however, provide you with a few solid hours of great entertainment.
B005IZLPMY|1.0|HOLLYWOOD DOES NOTHING BUT TAKE COMIC BOOK AND VIDEOGAME CHARACTERS CONCEPTS AND TURNS SOMETHING THAT WAS GREAT AND TURN IT INTO TRASH...(EXAMPLE:  DAREDEVIL, SPIDERMAN, RESIDENT EVIL CAPTAIN AMERICA, HULK TOMB RAIDER, SUPERMAN, GI JOE, ELECTRA, ETC.)
630021463X|4.0|In this VHS version you can see the Vulcan logo on the back of Spock's dress, and in the DVD one they change it to a pizza, because Papa Johns gave them a money endorsement.<br /><br />In the DVD commentary track Spock (Zachary Quinto) explains he doesn't like that, and that's why I bought this VHS one. The old man make-up and voice changers they used to make Zachary look old work better on VHS anyway.<br /><br />Also you will need a VCR is another thing to know if you purchase this item.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|This album by Lenny Kravitz is his strongest album to date. The album abounds with catchy melodies that have strong hooks. The album combines a rock and  funk style with a variety of other influences that keep the listener engaged.  In case you are interested,there are at least 3 different versions of this album that I know of. The regular USA version, the import deluxe version, and the Target version. I have the 2 cd Target version which comes in a thick digi pack with a second disc containing 6 bonus tracks.  If you like James Brown,Jimmi Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, Elvis Costello,Rick James, and Sean Paul, I believe you will like this album.I seem to hear all of these influences in this collection of first rate material.  This is one of the best albums to come out this year. It will appeal to music fans who like catchy melodies with a rock-funk edge, strong hooks, interesting lyrics.
B005VYGE64|5.0|Dean has always tried to carry everything on his own shoulders and harbors an enormous amount of guilt inside. He does the wrong things at times for the right reasons, but he just can't let go of the past. We all feel guilty about something at some point in our lives, but I think the question is whether we can learn from our mistakes and move on in order to seek redemption, to make amends for past sins. To serve your time, so to speak. This episode deals with it very well in bringing it to our attention and showing a more vulnerable side of Dean.
B003L77GGK|5.0|again the boys have not let us down! The writing on this show is just mind blowing. I cannot believe they have not been recognized for any of the show's talents. The characters good and bad just keep getting more interesting and hook you in at every episode. I always wonder how they will out do themselves each week and sure enough they manage to pull another unique and interesting episode. I enjoy the re-occurring characters dead and alive. The ending will blow you away and an amazing lead in to their 7th season! I have shared this amazing series with a bunch of my friends and now they have all become regular viewers past and present episodes. I am waiting for Mr. Krippe to get his due recognition for an awesome idea and making it pure entertainment! Jensen and Jared are fun to watch and it helps they have such great chemistry together. They are the best looking demon chasers on TV.  Rock on!

B004HW7JMO|5.0|I just enjoyed this movie as well as the first series. I cannot wait for the last series to start in January for the completion of my trillagy!! This movie was well written and put together and I recommend it for everyone that is interested in Roman Time.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|This movie is very much \\"British Style\\" humor, but it is hilarious! Tom Hardy has an understated role as Handsome Bob, and he pulls it off beautifully. I loved this dark comedy!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Yes, there is blood in this movie. However, this is probably the BEST comedy I have seen in a while. The story is unique and the humor is non-stop. I don't say this a lot...Great movie!!!

0393338398|5.0|I had no interest in baseball before reading this book, and I still don't.  But every word of \\"Moneyball\\" was thoroughly absorbing and entertaining.  This book is the third of Mr. Lewis' works that I've read, and it is certainly the one I've most enjoyed.  He is a terrific writer, who not only relates a story, but has the insight to find the crux of it, and figure out the best way to relate it.
B005I64U5C|1.0|Please note that I'm not rating the movie itself here, but the method for which my \\"digital copy\\" was provided to me.  Sadly I've not even watched the movie yet and was so irked by this \\"digital copy\\" garbage that I had to write this review to get it out of my system.  Hopefully the movie deserves a better review and isn't just garbage being protected by a garbage \\"digital copy\\" method.  Having purchased numerous DVD and BluRay movies I make it a practice these days to only by movies that have a digital copy if one is available.  I was excited to find the BluRay 3D/BluRay/DVD combo pack for Green Lantern also came with a digital copy.  The package arrived and I quickly opened it to load the digital copy so my kids could watch it via our AppleTV.  Boy was I disappointed.  What I found instead was a code that allowed my to sign up for accounts on TWO different services (Flixster and Ultraviolet) so that I could \\"enjoy\\" my new digital copy.  After fighting through that process and having numerous difficulties with the confusion that it was actually TWO different accounts I was creating I discovered that I could now download an watch my movie to any COMPUTER that has Adobe Air installed.  I can also STREAM my movie to any network connected mobile device I have that supports the Flixster application.  What I cannot do is download my movie to watch on any of my mobile devices (nor obviously my AppleTV mentioned above) for viewing without an Internet connection.    This simply does not make me happy as I use digital copies and our AppleTV to protect my investment in movies by making them available to my family in an easy to use way that doesn't require them handling the discs (since heaven forbid we make a legal backup copy).  If my disc is ruined I'm out of luck, so I choose to support companies who give me the content I've bought in the manner *I* want, and from this point forward I will not be choosing to purchase movies that support this asinine method of providing digital copies.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|a descent game of checkers  thank you for not requesting all kinds of permissions, for enabling move 2SD, and having nice graphics  would like to see: undo option
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|First off if you were ever a fan of Final Fantasy 1 - 6 you will get a kick out of Symphony.<br />It's clean, easy and fun. However it could use some depth. Spells all look the same, e.g. an earth spell still looks like a fireball. Controls are good up to the point when a screen exit overlaps the map button, and then it takes some creativity to guess at how to continue. I really like the non &quot;random series of irritating encounters&quot; as you can actually evade your enemies. Overall, fun and worth the time.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|It is exactly  that, checkers. Nothing overly fancy and challenging enough to keep you coming back. How the heck someone would think this is chess is beyond me.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Great game of checkers, with different difficulty levels. Though for two bucks its overpriced considering you cant play against other people
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Thor was an awesome movie.  It had a lot of action with a good story line and good acting.  I am excited for the Avengers movie whenever that comes out.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Seriously love this game, its like having old school final fantasy in your pocket. BUY THIS GAME!   Beware, you will get lost in this game and only realize how long you've been playing when your battery dies. The dialogue needs some work, as does the story line but nothing major that can't be overlooked.
0385534639|5.0|One of the most magickal books I have ever read.  I can remember no other story that created such a vivid, stunning picture in my mind.  I wish, wish, wish there was such magic in the world.  Would love to see how the circus survived into the present.  WONDERFUL BOOK-what an accomplishment for a new writer!!
B004LGPBZI|5.0|OK, I know this is not the best album ever but it is a great album you must listen to...Oasis is unique and unfortunatelly Noel is not part of this project. Although this made me feel better when I thought rock and roll was dead THANKS LIAM!!<br />Personally I recommend \\"Millionaire\\", \\"Wigwam\\", \\"Standing on the edge of the Noise\\" and \\"Kill for a Dream\\"...if you are depressed this is going to cheer you up.

Having hunted with my beagles for many years I can tell you that \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" rekindled my association with my beagles, both in the field and in the home!

B005U9RQNU|5.0|A friend told me that the final episode of season 3 of Breaking Bad contained something like the best three minutes of television, ever. I watched it, easily figured out which scene he was talking about, thought it was cool, but had to say \\"no...not quite.\\" If he'd been talking about the final episode of season 4, on the other hand, I might just have to agree. Wow.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|If you like the original, you'll enjoy this one.  Same premise, with just enough differences to make it feel like a good sequel.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|works great, finally.  absolutely no instructions on software installation and set up.  I am above average experience computer guy, took me several tries, and several hours.  would be so easy if there were any instructions at all.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|very entertaining and with a nice sense of humor.  Added scenes neither add or substract from the experience, I barely noticed any difference
B005CMSDKA|3.0|Hanna (Saorirse Ronan) is raised in an aortic type of wilderness 9actualy Finland) to keep her safe from the outside world until she decides she is ready. Once she decides she is ready for the world it may not be the world she imagines.<br /><br />We travel along with her as she learns about family, friendship and love. She also learns about her past and we speculate on her future.<br /><br />The problem is this film is way to artsy to just be a shoot, slice and bludgeon them up. It spins more time on unique music that is much louder than the dialog. Pictures of vast panoramas that is inconsequential to the story.<br /><br />The Blu-ray DVD extras are the standard how it is made and whet they are trying to say and do not quite get there.  They even made the cabin as a work of art.<br /><br />Look up Hanna!<br /><br />\\"The soul of man has been given wings\\" (Charles Chaplin), \\"The Great Dictator\\"
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I really spend a lot of time playing sudoku on my phone and this will make a nice compliment to it.  Very easy to understand, pick your color of pieces, difficulty level of the computer, click on a piece and it shows you the available moves.  Checkers should be an easy and enjoyable game to play, and with the high quality graphics and nice user interface this app is something i will keep on my phone and use quite often.
B004RE29PO|5.0|The sequel to \\"Alien\\" is more action than horror, though it's sure to send chills down the spines a those afeared'a double-jawed critters. This extended version slightly improves the film -- though the sequence of Newt's parents discovering the alien ship doesn't tell us anything new, and leaves us wondering how her mother got her father back to the vehicle with the face-hugger attached. We also get to hear Newt's annoying windowpane-shattering scream one more time. *<br /><br />The last half hour has to be one of the most-exciting in movie history, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in.<br /><br />H2G2 fans will note that, when Ripley is receiving firearms instruction, the weapon's counter reads 42.<br /><br />I am obliged to complain about James Horner's score. Not only is it inferior to Jerry Goldsmith's for \\"Alien\\", but Horner steals material -- in this case, a thematic idea -- from Goldsmith's \\"Star Trek\\" score.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.<br /><br />* When Ripley and Newt are trying to escape from the infirmary, the windows are made of flexible plastic, but when the marines break in, they shatter. Could it be that Newt's earlier screams made them brittle?
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I don't understand how you can make all the checker pieces the same. I can't tell which ones are checker pieces and which ones are checker pieces. Plus update this game with a fix so that I can better tell the difference between checker and checker pieces. Until then I will keep this five star rating until this update is applied. Thank you and good day.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The film does a great job of balancing the two worlds here, visually and with the character inter-play - great direction from Kenneth Branagh.  And the casting is great with solid and believable performances from all.  Visually excellent throughout, funny in parts, thrilling, etc!!  I did not see this in the theater, but the Blu-ray is stunning, particularly in Asgard.  It's solid entertainment for super-hero fans, and in general.  Rent it, buy it, either way, just see it if you have not - or again and again like I will if you have.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This film is worth experiencing.  It's absolutely polarizing, you'll either love it or hate it.  It touches on everything personal and intrinsic to our journey through life. Do NOT expect this to be a traditional popcorn film,  you'll be very disappointed.  However, If you watch it with an open mind you'll fall in love.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|At age 15 my first job was at Sidewinder Cafe in Newberry, CA. Mojave Desert. On my 62 birthday a lifetime friend, my husband and I decided to go back to the desert and see how it was doing. We visited the Barn, community center, old homesteads, then went to see if Sidewinder was still standing..... couldn't see it for the tour buses. We found a parking spot, the building was the same, old stripped Avion and Silverstreak trailers parked outside, people taking pics everywhere, cafe dirty but full of people. Cook... dirty and rude, piano in dining area, everything seemed broken but happy people everywhere.. They were all European, most didn't talk English. We kept asking why they were here, finally 1 German lady said... didn't you see the movie and pointed to a film poster on the wall. She put her hand to her chest and said it was wonderful. Well, much more happened while there (now named the Bagdad Cafe because of movie).. (all good), we left mystified, curious AND ordered Bagdad Cafe from Amazon as soon as we arrived back home. It is a cult movie. It was a rage in Europe, Asia, etc. We watched our first cult movie and.... loved it. We will watch it again, and again... we recommend this little jewel, made us laugh and think.
B0058A119G|5.0|Plain and simple, the most amazing signer we have...yesterday, today and tomorrow. Just gets better and more beautiful. This is is the voice of American music. Not need for awards, top ten lists, or single sales. And yet shes has all of those too. Thank your Barbra!
B005LMEB8E|2.0|I really love Demi Lovato as an actress and a singer.  Her last two albums were actually very unique and didn't seem framed at all by Disney; they had a rock edge with a few softer songs, but were both enjoyable and packed respective punches.  This album is not bad because it's different, but because it's quite generic.  With perhaps \\"Skyscraper\\" being the sole exception, the rest of the songs seem patched together from random pop songs on the radio, and many were quite miss-able.    I'll be looking forward to her next album, as I respect her as a musician, and I think she'll get to a place where she's content in her musical expression where she'll truly shine through.  But as for now, I think I'll keep this album on the shelf.
B004JLDSIC|5.0|Kent's phrasing and diction are refreshingly clear.  Tomlinson's musicianship complements and enhances this wonderful  presentation!  It was a treat to listen to!
B005EVVESM|5.0|Maroon5 is one of my personal favorite groups! I have listened to this cd uncountable times. I LOVE IT!!! AMAZING work.

0345479092|5.0|This book saved me! After reading 5 other hand me down books, I finally read this one... and it was the last. Her simple advice on understanding basic needs of a newborn and implementing a routine (NOT a schedule) of sleep, eat, activity, sleep saved my sanity. The message is simple and like all the books I read, more pages are given than necessary to explain the basic points. But this was by far the most helpful.
006117758X|3.0|When I was reading reviews and thinking about my experience with Ham on Rye (my second outing with Bukowski, after having read Pulp), I initially thought I would give it 1 or 2 stars based on how much I disliked the character. I started checking out Bukowski after doing a thesis on the importance of Beat lit, and noting his proximity to the time frame and stylistic similarities to the writers I so adore.  I disliked Henry Chinaski because, in my mind, he felt real like a lot of the characters I had loved in my favorite books, but instead of having a glowing outlook on life despite setbacks he just let it fester inside him and make him bitter, and I ended up resenting Chinaski for most of his personality (he comes off as a chauvanistic, alcoholic, bitter prick to be completely frank). That coupled with the fact that it seemed as though he was parading around how bad his childhood was because he was poor, had bad acne, etc it started to feel like a pissing contest with no one in particular in mind. But the more I thought about it and dissected him, there were portions of that personality I loved that would peek out from under the foil of a disenchanted youth, angry at the world. There's an odd sort of humanity in Chinaski, and it's very unique to this novel.  This book is also very funny, if you don't take it (or yourself) too seriously. I don't know that Bukowski meant it to be humorous in a satirical or ironic sense, but if you don't internalize the things Chinaski thinks, says, or does, and just take them at face value in context of the rest of his personality, it actually is quite funny. But be forewarned, if you are offended easily you should turn back now. I have yet to check out Bukowski's poetry, but I think I will now that I reflect on this novel.  Oh, and the fanboys flocking to the 1 star reviews: calm down a little bit. Just because some users don't (or can't) see what you see in a book does not necessarily make them mindless philistines. A majority of thecomments I've seen on reviews were attacking people's intellect, self-esteem, or even their ability to read. It's nice that you enjoy your books, let that be enough.
0316776963|1.0|I didn't enjoy the book.  Wasn't funny like the reviews on the back of the book read.  Some may have found it funny, but to me it was a pointless list of uneventful life stories...
0439023521|5.0|It's Thunderdome with kids.  Plus there's some soap thrown in there for gravy.  I often wonder if Joss Whedon changed his name, stripped some of his trademark humor, and wrote a book.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|I am speaking from my own experience with this product, I have not had this for longer than 24 hours as of yet but it still has went above and over it's worth. I bought the htc amaze recently and needed a small bag to protect it while I carry it around. The bag protected the unit from keys and numerous other hazards and kept my phone nice and shiny in the process. I am extremely happy I purchased this product, as for the the quality of the bag, it is made of a slightly stiff manufactured material but it feels nice and stable the bag I received did not have any loose threads or any other malfunctions. I do not speak for everyone but I will say in my own experience this is a great value and worth every cent and then some!
014241722X|4.0|When most 13 year olds have free time, they like to play ball, video games, or go to the mall.  But not Theodore Boone.  Theo likes to spend his spare time at the court house, chatting up paralegals or law clerks.  He learns the law so that he can move on to be a lawyer, and maybe one day a great judge.  But when an illegal immigrant comes to him as a witness to a murder, a murder being tried in court, where his testimony could change the outcome entirely, Theo feels like he's in over his head.  But that won't stop this 13 year old from being a great advocate for his \\"client\\".<br /><br />Grisham is a great writer of novels about lawyers and trials.  This book is well suited for the young readers it was written for.  It's a fun read for anybody 10 and older.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|couldn't tell the the pieces apart?  brilliant con by that reviewer.  he or she is smart enough to use the technology to write a review, right?  very clever.  but I can't tell the difference between red and white due to color blindness.  therefore all of the red pieces should be square.  and because of this lack of consideration I reduce my rating by 1 star.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|all i get is static noise  through the compatible headphones. item is defective and of very poor quality for the price i purchased it.

B0049GYXDG|5.0|I love this movie!  Yes it's a little bizarre with the silly characters but I love it.  I was so excited to watch this with my daughter so she could enjoy one of the classic Disney movies too.  She really liked it.
B005VYGE64|5.0|This episode isn't as fast paced or action packed as the rest usually are but I think it did great in defining Sam and Dean further, people have been asking for more on Dean and this episode gets right to it, it has very little to do with Sam, as far as I saw it only had one time that suggested Sam was seeing Satan still beyond the end dialogue. This is a great episode that lets you see deeper into how the Winchesters really feel.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|wow and wow and wow.  WHAT WAS THAT??????????  SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!  I kept on waiting for something to happen and nothing happen.  I did not mind paying $3 for that movie since i did not know it was that bad its the fact i spent 2 hours watching pure garbage.  I m so mad, i could have watched something better.
0385344325|5.0|I only started reading Lee Child books last year and most of them have been very enjoyable.  This was the first one I had to wait for to be published.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Was on a par with my first Jack Reacher book, Gone Tomorrow.  Too bad that I'll have to wait for the Reacher next book.

B005DD7TI0|4.0|Agree with other reviewer: this one is a sleeper.  One of the best written and produced science fiction films I've seen in a long time.  This one is a must for anyone who enjoys a solid thriller.

Well the first reviewer thought it was chess and gave it one star cause he couldn't tell the Rooks from the Pawns..... lol lol lol!  Yes folks there are people this stupid out there!
B004CAFUOU|4.0|Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.<br />After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.<br />The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.<br /> The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.<br />Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf. This amazing read forcibly opens your mind to imagine every detail and corner of this story you can feel yourself get lost, just be careful you don't end up in an opium den!this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf.

B00178JDCK|4.0|Works as good as some more expensive pedals. My one complaint is I think it should have \\"click stops\\" on the switch.
B002ZG981E|5.0|...you just might like [[ASIN:B002U0KHNS The Prisoner (Miniseries)]].  It has a similar science-fiction plot device, but rather than take you on the best snow-covered adventure this side of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, it takes your dream self a few levels deeper into & beyond Patrick McGoohan's original vision of THE PRISONER, which many have debated all takes place within the mind of its protagonist, Number 6.  For a big-budget, big-name \\"studio\\" picture, INCEPTION requires that you PAY ATTENTION, as you might to a small, independent film, where plot & dialogue primarily move the story along.  There's nothing passive about INCEPTION.  If you follow what's going on, there will be parts of this film where you may actually feel the synapses fire within your brain with the rush that accompanies it and you think, \\"I know exactly what they're doing, and WHY and HOW, & I doubt that anyone else in this room has figured this out!\\", especially during some of the \\"trippier\\" parts.  So, if you enjoy the challenges that INCEPTION provide, and crave the next level, the 21st century \\"re-imagining\\" of THE PRISONER should deliver.

B00000K0DQ|5.0|This was a hard movie to watch.  The film poses the question, would you forgive someone if he killed your son or raped your daughter?  It briefly shows snapshots of the grizzly crime scene for which Sean Penn's character was given the death penalty, and an equally stomach-churning lethal injection episode, which in my mind goes on far too long.  But mainly the film explores in detail the efforts of Sister Helen Prejean to help the felon find that even murderers and rapists are children of God.  It also demonstrates her philosophy that forgiveness is not in the same arena as social standards, the justice system, or even real guilt or innocence. The nun tries to convey God's all-loving nature to the parents of both victims.  They will have none of it, and castigate her for \\"taking the killer's side\\".  Even the parish priest shows his prejudice and disdain for the killer and warns Sister Helen against his attempts to win her over.  Whether the killer was convicted or acquited has nothing to do with the nun's forgiving him. At the end, Sister Helen, acting as God's emissary, finally convinces Penn that she forgives him and loves him, because God forgives him and loves him regardless of his crimes. Both Sarandin and Penn give superb and convincing performances. Tim Robbins is excellent as the director. The camera work is stark and true to life.  I highly recommend this film.
B0052GACNM|3.0|I expected more of the people who sang with Tony Bennett to be on this tape. He overshadowed the peeople that he sang with.  It was a very good tape but too much of him and too little of the people that he had duets with.
B00005MCX0|4.0|\\"In Search of Space\\" is the best of Hawkwind along with \\"Hall of the mountain grill\\". Most artists have one or two albums that stand out above the rest. For a first timer thinking about Hawkwind, buy these two.
1594202842|5.0|I actually like this book in fact I was so into this book that I finished this before the weekend was over. I even read to my boyfriend (who is Asian) some passages that were very stereotypically Asian. He goes \\"now you see why I don't talk back to my parents!\\"   Originally I borrowed the book from the library and I liked the book so much I decided to buy it so I can pass it around with my friends and anyone who is interested. This is not a parenting book and this is a memoir--you can see that Chua has a lot more character depth than just being an evil over bearing mother.  I think the those who give negative reviews don't have a sense of humor. I mean the front cover kind of gives it away that it's suppose to be pretty funny/sarcastic. Also you can tell she is being sarcastic in the book because she does over-exaggerate some stereotypes--just a warning.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I did play a couple of games before I rated it  and it works just fine.  Seems like pretty straightforward checkers to be.  I wouldn't have paid $2 for it, but it's good for a free app.  And just to join my voice to the chorus....NOT CHESS, like the idiot who wrote the first review believed.

0743454537|1.0|This is the first and the last of your books that I will read.  I was enjoying the book in spite of the cliched characters  and the often unrealistic dialogue.  Then the entire book was destroyed by a totally manipulative ending.  I agree completely with the Most Helpful negative review by Susan Jones and the other one star reviews.  You should have listened to your son and not the oncology nurse (re: interview with author at the back of the book).  An oncology nurse would surely be biased toward saving the cancer patient.  And wasn't Kate's doctor saying before the trial that Kate was too sick to survive a kidney transplant?    I am reminded of the author's dilemma in the movie \\"Stranger than Fiction\\".  Killing off her main character might have made her book great (it did not yours), but she did the right thing and let him live.  Anna's mother claimed she did the right thing.  She didn't and neither did you.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This is one of those dvd's I never in my life would have thought to buy.  But I picked up a copy at a garage sale and absolutely love it.  I didn't know what I was missing.  From Bill Monroe to Roy Orbison, Linda Ronstadt, the Everly Brothers with their father, to my very favorite of all - Eric Clapton, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash doing Matchbox together(I would have loved to have been fly on the wall for that because immediately after the song Clapton goes over to Perkins and begins a conversation - if only it had been picked up by the mike).  Have I left out anybody of significance?  Only Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, James Taylor, Jerry Lee Lewis, Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams Jr., Neil Young, Stevie Wonder, Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles and the list goes on and on.  What an incredible collection of musicians and music.  My biggest disappointment is that it's not twice as long.  One more perk, it's 1970's fashion ... and they all look so young.
B005DI994W|5.0|This magnificent Korda production looks beautiful on Blu Ray.  A story often told but never better than in this version.  If you love old movies and Criterion's loving remastering of them, this is a keeper for any collector's library.  The story of a man accused by his fellow soldiers -- and friends and his fiancee -- of cowardice on the eve of war when he resigns his commission and then sets to prove something to himself is a timeless tale.  Forget the other versions, this is the one to have.  Blu Ray brings out the beauty of the early Technicolor photography and with a sweeping score by Miklos Roza. 1939, a year that also saw GONE WITH THE WIND, THE WIZARD OF OZ, DODGE CITY, STAGECOACH, ROARING TWENTIES, GUNGA DIN, BEAU GEASTE, INTERMIZZO, DARK VICTORY, DESTRY RIDES AGAIN, YOUNG MISTER LINCOLN, DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK and too many other acknowledged classic films.  This one stands well with all the rest. Get it. Trust me on this one.  You will not be disappointed. Extras include an interview with director Zoltan Korda's son and a featurette from 1939 on the making of the film.  Hey, it has the grand old crusty stalwart C. Aubrey Smith and John Clements and Sir Ralph Richardson.  All are long gone but what they did lives on.  Well it should.
B001YXS7JI|4.0|The Very Best of Dire Straits showcases the groups swinging bluesy style. I must admit I bought the CD for cuts like Sultans of Swing, Lady Writing and Money for Nothing but found gems like Calling Elvis and Heavy Fuel. The lyrics are rough at times but not foul and the music is not complicated, but tightly composed and very well played. Like me, if you want some great examples of a this group you can't go wrong with putting The Very Best of Dire Straits on your shelf.
0307277453|5.0|There is little I can add to the chorus of positive voices regarding this book, but I had to try when I realized how often I refer back to it in conversation. I'm not a professional scientist, but I greatly enjoy applying scientific concepts and knowledge to everyday life. I listened to this book on audio during a road trip with my homeschooled kids. It was a tremendous opportunity for us to listen & discuss. Both of my kids have a passion for aspects of science; my daughter is now majoring in the environmental sciences, and my son loves paleontology. This book gives us a common reference point for ourselves, as well as a resource to point others to in discussion. It's one of the few books I'm sure I'll want to re-read, to glean additional information.
0670022411|1.0|I love witchy books, Harry Potter, the Sookie Stackhouse mysteries. Historical fiction is fun, too. The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova was surprising and entertaining. I am fascinated with Oxford, UK, the Bodleian, the Ashmolean, medieval castles... I wanted to like this book... it's right in my wheel-house. I don't want to be mean, but it was just awful. I almost never put down a book before finishing it. I feel committed once I've begun. I just simply could not go on with this one.  There is zero humor in the book. I don't mean that it lacks for laughs, just that every single character is like a caricature out of a Renaissance Faire. There is no life in this book. My disbelief was never, for one moment, suspended. All that is missing is someone calling someone else M'lady or My Lord. The writing is sudsy and melodramatic. The characters don't respond appropriately to situations. There is much indignation with this, and fury about that, none of which is proportional to the events; the emotions just do not ring true.  The pacing is awful. I wonder how it was able to pass through editing without losing a couple hundred pages. A new chapter begins, characters appear, and then nothing much happens.   And I am sorry, but a yoga class for supernatural beings is just a ridiculous idea. It was about the time of the first yoga class that I started to realize that this book was going nowhere fast. The one plot item that is interesting - the alchemy book - appears for a couple pages right in the beginning of the novel. I reached page 300-something, and not a hint of it again. But there are sexist, pastoral Occidentals eyeing the fine horsemanship of M'Lady with knowing admiration; dull, grumpy vampires speaking dead languages and being petulant; a lot of very Harlequin Novel-esque romancing, complete with rooms full of candles; and let us not forget the protagonist, the most unheard of magical being in the world...    It is a syrupy romance novel with pretensions. I don't care how it ends.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|An excellent production. The horror of war, the tragedy & triumph of the pacific theater is rivetting as you come to know the men that fought and died so bravely. Worth every cent. Outstanding and on par with classics such as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" & \\"Band of Brothers\\".

Quality software like this makes me want to check out their other apps.  Well done!
030788743X|5.0|This is for you: If you are a child of the 80's.  If you revel in all things geek culture.  If you still play retro video games.  If you become obsessed with things pop culture.  If you want to be rewarded for watching too many movies and TV.  If you are looking for a book that wraps all of that up and also manages to keep you entertained every step of the way.    Ready Players one is for every geek out there who loves to enjoy the idea of geek and nerd-dom.  It embraces the personality, culture and embodiment of what it means to be a geek with narrative that centers around a plethora of those same elements.  In a distopian future, not too far away, a young man obsessed with escaping the bleak stark reality around him immerses himself into the Oasis, a worldwide phenomenon VR/internet universe, and becomes lost in the video game creator's last great quest.  The game escapes the bounds of Oasis as a corporation, IOI, uses every resource at their hand to conquer this quest in the desire for owning the Oasis so they can rule and continue the current degraded future of the world.  Our hero, Wade Watts, learns to separate himself and discover just what it means to become obsessed with escapism and the pearls that entails.  If you like, listen to the audiobook version read by a masterful and flavorful Wil Wheaton.  He does an amazing job of conveying who Wade Watts is, the raw character of Wade's encounters, and just what it means to be a geek.

I will not buy this first output of all HP movies for two reasons:  1) very expensive for what I already own, 2) I want to sit with my adult daughters and glory over all things HP that they grew up with and that we enjoyed together.  I will wait, or maybe not buy at all and look for something on eBay.

BLUES FOR RED SUN, SKY VALLEY and this one are masterpieces!!!!!
B003L77FYS|4.0|Ongoing storylines make significant progress, the relational tension between Castle & Beckett finally comes to a head and occasionally things get, really, really meta in Castle season 3. This season features some of the series' best writing and acting thus far, moving the characters forward while doing a very good job of keeping things accessible for new viewers. Fans won't be disappointed with this DVD collection.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Just finished this book, and LOVED IT!  Have read all the Reacher novels, most of them twice, and this one is, in my opinion, the very best.  Great plot, great pacing, and outstanding rise to the finish.  Only thing I don't understand...how does anyone read this book at one sitting?  I must just be slow.  And yes, I'm a Lee Child fan, big time.  But now, what to do next?  This book leads us straight into the first Jack Reacher story, Killing Floor, and nothing new in sight.  So what....read that one again?  Guess so...
086571701X|5.0|I wish I had read this book 4 months ago, I would have saved money and time. Started building the system 4 months ago and just got this book.  I have made several mistakes that she covered in this book I could have avoided.  Darn.  Better late than never.  With such a new system I'm sure there will be many more disasters she has saved me from in the future.  Well written, easy to read and an exciting process.  Finally got my system to \\"cycle\\" and the plants are growing... fast.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Songs for the Deaf is a masterpiece, the album flows like a radio station, and that station brings great metal. All the Songs are great, with classics like No one Knows, Go with the flow and song for the dead. Really great heavy rock album!
159562015X|2.0|I purchased this book and was told it was NEW.  When I received it the code in the back that you need to do the assessment online had already been used.  I contacted the vendor and they never responded to me.  The book itself looks good, but if I could do it again I would purchase at a retail location so I could make sure I was getting a new book.  I wasted $16.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I bought the music for my nephew as he was dancing in his seat when we saw the movie in the theater.  I now have it in my car and listen to it with him when we are out and about.  I really like this soundtrack.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|the story line is engaging and different. both lead actresses suck you into their character roles from the beginning. you find yourself indentifying with them and feeling their mental and emotional journey. the sex scene is very intimate and real. the supporting cast members are also very talented and engaging. its one of the best lesbian films i've ever seen.
B00005UEAR|4.0|Although the potential has been there throughout their career, the direction the band takes on all their later releases, just eh, the albums don't compare to these older classics.    With this one some seeds of those future directions are sown, needlessly longer songs, crappy add ins by Jordan, Portny's adding some crappy vocals.  Seriously they should've put a stop to it here and now, and they'd not have ruined Constant Motion, or Nightmare To Remember.  I seriously hope they remake some of these songs, after Jordan is kicked out of the band first.  Don't want that talentless prick ruining that too.  Rant aside, this album starts a heavier sound direction they'd continue with on the next, and skipping one album, two more after that.  The songwriting is still solid.  James's vocals are still great, and his melodies are awesome.  the guitar, bass, and drumming are all great.  Keys are hit and miss.  This would be the last album Jordan would have anything I'd enjoy.  Guy really has done nothing useful since, unless you count ruining songs with crappy circus noises.    I really wish they'd condensed this to a 1 disc album, shortening some needlessly long songs.  It seems a rip off to pay for a 2 disc set when 1 would do fine.  Besides disc 1 is far superior to disc 2 anyways, which is mostly a medly with some songs mixed in with parts of others.  I just don't care for disc 2 in its entirety.    Glass Prison 8/10 is one of the more frustrating Dream theater songs, like most of Black Clouds, except with better lyrics.  We get a continuation of the static noise that ended Scenes From A Memory, what's pretty cool is these albums run into each other, and the way they're set up on itunes, you can hear it.  The album titles are synced alphabetically.  We get a nice acoustic intro, before the song becomes a borderline thrasher.  Well one problem Portny starts adding his ridiculous excuse for vocals.  Someone should've put a muzzle on the guy whilst they were in the studio.  the playing is great, and the melodies, which should have all been sung by James are great.  They had a solid intro, verse, and chorus, but then they decide to make this track a medly of ideas, whereas they could have had 2 good songs out of it.  Then we get a still heavy song, but slower.  This part is still good, and the main part of the song.  the chorus is decent, but not as good as the first part, which if that had been a full song, and take out Mike's awful vocals, that one would be a perfect 10 in my book.  But, what I say with a lot of the ruined opportunities Dream Theater would have from here on out, WHATEVER!  Uh!  We get more crappy Mike vocals, uh I'm starting to want to change my rating for the song.  But I won't.  Overall it's too long for my taste.  Songs should only be long when the direction of the song leads it to being that long, not when you're just slapping a bunch of stuff together, or jamming out.  Blind Faith 8/10 would get a 9, but for the extra long instrumental break.  the verses are softer, with nice melodies, both vocally and guitar.  The rest of the band fills the verses just fine.  The chorus is heavier, and has a nice hook to it.  The second verse is heavier, so there's a nice progression there, having something different in each verse to keep it from being repetitive.  There's some nice soloing by John to start the instrumental break.  Unfortunately we get an annoying piano piece by Jordan, which I HATE.  It adds nothing to the song, and if I could remove it and still have the transition sound good I would.  Misunderstood 9/10 would get a perfect score, and my mp3 of it does actually.  When putting it on my computer I faded out the outro, and had it only last like 30 seconds, instead of 2+ minutes.  The song starts with an acoustic guitar, strumming a bit.  There are some really good lyrics in this song, and James has fantastic vocals on this one.  There are some decent pieces by Jordan, hard to admit, but at this point I didn't havea hatred for the guy, as I would by the next album, and it's grown since then.  At that same time he has some awful moments here too.  Part of the instrumental break, and the last over 2 minutes of the song are the same riff repeated over and over, with Jordan adding strange noises that don't need to be there.  This song should not have been 9 or more minutes.  I cut it off at just under 7, and faded out the outro, and it sounds awesome.  All complaints aside this is a really good song, and one of my favorite Dream Theater ballads.  The Great Debate 8/10 another one that goes on too long, but it's still a really good song.  The intro and outro are mostly the same beat, with some keyboards and a bunch of audio samples related to the lyrics, discussions of stem cell research which was controversial at the time.  I shortened them, and faded it in and out when putting it on my computer, not bad, but they go on forever.  Even with shortening the song, it still clocks in at almost 10 minutes, but still it flows so much better.  the verses are upper mid tempo, with some heavy guitars in the mix.  Without reading the lyrics, the band seems to present both sides of the issue, which is refreshing considering all the political music that would come out for the rest of the decade.   Disappear 7/10 with a good chorus this song would be a perfect 10.  This is Jordan's last good moment in the band, to date.  The keys, and piano and the guitars work beautifully, and I love the airy effect they put on James's vocals.  They really gave him room to grow on this one.  The chorus isn't really anything special, and would've been a better build up to a chorus.  Actually that's my issue with this song, is it feels like it's building towards something, and never gets there.  It's still really good and the last wow moment on the album, but it could've been so much better.  Disc 2 I won't really break down so much.  It's kind of a mixed bag.  War Inside My Head, what's there is pretty awesome, heavy song, with nice verses and choruses, but, and I can't believe I'm saying this, it's too short.  They cut it off after the second chorus, without an instrumental break of any kind, ruining another potentially great song.  About To Crash is ok, nothing really special, but they didn't need 2 versions.  The Test That Stumped Them All and Solitary Shell are ok, although I hate the keyboarding in Solitary Shell.  It sounds too happy for the song.  And I cannot get into Goodnight Kiss.  I don't know why, but this song bothers me.  Overall this is a must own for Dream Theater fans.  It's the last album I really enjoy, although I've still been able to find enjoyment in all their releases since, they just haven't been the same.  If you're new to the band, I wouldn't necessarily recommend starting here.  It's good, disc 1 anyways, but Scenes from a memory, Awake, and Images And Words are all better.  Still though this is a very solid addition to the Dream Theater discography.  Man, I can't believe it's been out 10 years now.  Where does the time go?
B00004TH6O|5.0|QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE second album R is a great collection of HEAVY ROCK songs....LEG OF LAMB, AUTO PILOT, IN THE FADE and THE LOST ART OF KEEPING A SECRET are some of the best stuff QOTSA created....R is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED for HEAVY ROCKERS all around the world....try the previous Joshua Homme band too....KYUSS is AMAZING too!!!!!!!!Well done, man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005VYGE64|5.0|It is rare thing for a show to be still knocking it out of the park creatively after 7 seasons, but Supernatural is somehow managing it. Season 7 has got off to an excellent start, and Defending Your Life carries on the high standards set so far. I recommend it highly.
1400079144|3.0|HAve to say, not a big Dan Brown fan but I did enjoy this book. The minute I picked it up, couldnt put it down. I liked the Villain Mal'akh and found him uber creepy. Was a bit let down with the Secret Ancient mystery at the end. Totally killed the whole buildup for me, but I liked the message of what Brown was conveying as surprisingly, I was reading other books related to the same material discussed by Brown and hence found the book enjoyable.   Would definitely recommend it to others. Love the way Dan Brown always explains the symbolism behind things we so take for granted which are set in our plain view. Love to see this into a movie.
B000E41MS6|5.0|This is the first I've ever seen of \\"Doctor Who\\" and thought it was brilliant!  I can't compare it to the original series, but the writing and acting are sharp, witty and completely engaging.  Some of the episodes are a little slow, but as a whole this season is awesome.  The only issue with the show is the honky-tonk special effects, but it doesn't take away from the show at all.  You may just have a laugh when you see some of the creatures.     On another note, when I received this set, the case was cracked and broken, with the discs falling out.  I contacted Amazon, who were so helpful and courteous.  I had no issue returning the set and received the replacement the next day.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this film.  Stories, whether books or musicals, when adapted to movie format, often fall short.  With Sweeney Todd, though, I think they did a very good job overall.<br /><br />Others have outlined the plot, so I won't.  I will say, though, that had this been a regular (non-musical) film, the casting would have been dead perfect for all that it seemed like a Harry Potter reunion.  Helena Bonham Carter is an excellent actress and we all know that she's an outstanding villain, especially when the villain needs to be on the psychotic side, although she did a super job portraying her maternal side around Toby.  She was a great choice for Mrs. Lovett.  Johnny Depp does creepy better than just about anyone.  Alan Rickman was an outstanding judge...and how funny was it to see his Harry Potter costar Timothy Spall as the Beadle?  With the same sort of spineless toady role.  Outstanding!<br /><br />Nevertheless, I was disappointed with Helena Bonham Carter's and Johnny Depp's singing voices.  They do sinister and creepy and nuts very well when they're just talking, but their voices are too thin to sing the songs with any kind of power.  I was particularly disappointed with \\"A Little Priest,\\" which is probably my favorite number from the musical; it didn't have the mustache-twirling jocularity it should have.  I mean, come on!  For all that it's a song about cooking and eating people, it's supposed to be funny!  After seeing the greats like Angela Lansbury and Patti LuPone and George Hearn rock this song on the stage, I just couldn't like the film version.  That said, \\"By The Sea\\" was far better than it is on stage.  Not the singing, the acting.  Sweeney Todd in that old fashioned bathing costume looking so supremely uncomfortable, putting his hand on Mrs. Lovett's knee for a couple excruciating seconds...that was worth the price of the DVD right there.  But back to my complaining: even though I wasn't expecting musical aptitude on par with George Hearn or Patti LuPone, I still think they could have done a better job finding actors who could really sing.  That's why this is getting four stars instead of five from me.<br /><br />Still, mediocre voices aside, it's a really good adaptation of a really *really* good musical, so to anyone reading this: buy it.LuPone, I still think they could have done a better job finding actors who could really sing.

B000063Y8F|3.0|This garlic press is definately better than my old Wall Mart special was.  It does a decent job of pressing garlic, except that the basket is small for large garlic cloves, and it has a tendancy to shoot garlic spray back at you and everywhere else when handling larger cloves.  Now I just cut them down to fit, which gets a knife dirty also.  I do like that the mesh cutter folds out which does make it very easy to clean, and not loose any parts.  My old one had a little basket that was all but imposible to clean, and easy to misplace.  So all in all I am happy with it.  It beats chopping 8 or 10 cloves by hand.  Wish they could design one that did not shoot back at you.
B005ER6STG|1.0|Send a message to the spineless distributors that we won't accept censored movies.  As if anyone who is ok with watching the cut version wouldn't also be ok with watching the uncut version... The ending of the cut version loses all its power.  Just find the real version online somewhere.
1423140591|5.0|I must say that Rick Riordan has amazed me once again. He hasn't really made this better than the first book but it is of equal value.  The cliff hangers aren't as steep in this book but the Writing(and curiosity)just makes we want to read more. I read this on my kindle and at the end there was like still a couple of percent of the book left which made me to believe there was another chapter so i went to the next page read the chapter title.... Glossary.... I then continued to say OMG! for about a minute. The cliff hanger at the end of the book is very subtle because you are so into the book that when you get to the end its not really an ending its more of a \\"Hey the books not over yet, More to Come\\" ending. So even though most of the conflict was resolved in the end, its still a very big cliff hanger. Just the invitation of more is very very tempting. Its like your eating your favorite food and your not done with it and the cook just takes it away mid-bite and says \\"You can't have any of this until a year from now\\"  If you haven't read the first book and you are planning on reading the series.... Don't torture yourself wait until at least the 3rd book comes out...
B0024FAR5W|5.0|the show mixes action and story pretty well. it captures the outlaw biker (from what i've seen) very well. there is just one minor problem. people from the inland valley of california don't use such big callege words. this is obvously written by someone with an education and not an outlaw biker from the valley.<br /><br />i just found this show and friends of mine say the other seasons are better. i can hardly wait<br /><br />and Katie Segal is HOT in her tight jeans
B00005V9HH|2.0|This movie is just over-the-top Hollywood BS. The writer must think TV is real...he certainly absorbed every mannerism and cliched story line that every cop show and gangster movie ever used, and he strings them all together in a convoluted mush that goes from one supposedly tense moment to another. This is the story of a writer and director trying to outdo other writers and directors who are trying to outdo others in turn. Turn the dial up to eleven. It doesn't have three minutes in it that seem like anything that could ever happen in real life. You're just watching actors act and a parade of standard movie effects. You can all but see the crew standing around in every scene.  Who cares? It's like the movie version of a video game. Slick trash, basically.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|The other reviewers articulate the reasons well. The show in general is far more engrossing than anything else I've ever seen.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I'm writing this review to rave about how fast I got it in the mail.  I had already seen the movie at the theater, so I knew I wanted a copy, but I'm currently living in Japan while my husband works for the military and I was uncertain as to how long it would take Amazon to get it to me.  Mail usually takes from one week to a month to get to us.  This movie got to us in 4 days!  Thanks, Amazon, for quick delivery so we could watch a great movie!
B001VNB54A|5.0|and the price was right - so I bought this good deal.  I was a little boy during  WWII, my father was a Marine stationed in Quantico, VA.  Many of the fathers of my friends experienced what is depicted in The Pacific.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Got a recommendation for this book from a waitress at Pier 500 in Hudson, WI while on a meet-up with my book club.  I admit, I was completely skeptical because I am not that into fantasy and all that.  But I loved the characters in this story and this book is like the kind of book that you can't wait to get home to read!  Loved it!  Can't wait to read the next book.  It was an unexpected escape into another world.  I loved Katniss.  This story has romance, adventure, heroism, love, courage...I could go on and on.  I highly recommend it.  A really nice surprise.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have read just about all Nicholas Sparks books and this without a doubt is his best.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. It is filled with love, family, suspense, murder --you name it. I can see this as a movie and I will be the first one there on row #1.  It is so descripitve that you actually can see yourself there.   Way to go Nicholas Sparks.    Carol Harrington  Jackson, Tennessee
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I've worked with DtG for over a year. I initially purchased and downloaded it onto my Blackberry Curve. It's been extremely helpful. When my laptop crashed, I was able to e-mail myself from our desktop computer several documents that I needed to work on, as well as a Power Point presentation I needed for the next day. This kept me from tying up the family computer all evening for my work. It's easily worth the price!

055358202X|4.0|well , it's George RR Martin , so the quality still in the story , i think that this book and the next are a transition in the  story , a preparation to a new phase of the story.

0375831002|4.0|I almost don't know where to begin with this one.  When I picked up the book, I knew nothing about it or the setting.  It's about a girl whose father teaches her to read...or so I thought.  I was so wrong.<br /><br />Death narrates this tale of a young girl's life in Nazi Germany with both a sense of humor and surprisingly much compassion as well.  And it is no easy tale to tell. There is unspeakable cruelty alongside unimaginable beauty.  We see the worst and best that humanity has to offer...sometimes in unexpected places...and we are reminded of just who we are and what we are capable of...the good and the bad.<br /><br />The authors writing took a little getting used to but the imagery in his text is amazing.  Each scene evoking a full range of the senses.  And despite the foreshadowing (I knew what to expect) I still found myself sobbing through the last few pages.<br /><br />Although marketed as Young Adult...I have no reservations about recommending this to Adults as well.  In short...Read this book.
030746363X|5.0|I bought this book back in January of this year, and started doing the Slow Carb Diet recommended in the book by Tim Ferriss.  Since that time, with NO exercise whatsoever, I have lost 55 pounds and I don't feel like I'm \\"wasting away\\".  I eat 4 meals a day, and there is nothing skimpy about the meals.  Tim says to not eat anything \\"white\\", such as bread, wheat of any kind, potatoes, sugars... ect.  If the diet didn't work for the doctor and his friends, then they simple didn't do it right.  I have turned several of my friends onto this diet and they've all seen results.  I am personally calling BS on the nonsense review below.  The stuff in the book works, and I can attest to that.  It's not expensive, and you could always turn around and resell it if you don't like it, but I can bet you've all spent more money than this on some dumbass fitness shake or bottle of miracle pills.  Just buy the damned book people.

B004HW7JMY|5.0|I love these Spartacus shows. I watch an episode before the football game every week. Some of my favorite players and coaches watch warrior movies before a game. So far it's worked. My team's 3-1. Nah, all superstition aside, these are great shows. The action is non-stop. It can be a little too sexual at times, but that's why they invented fast forward. Other people think that's the best part of the show, but I love all the action, camaraderie between the gladiators and the gore. And the language too. I love how they always say \\"Jupiter's c**k!\\" John Hannah's brilliant.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Wow! What a movie. I've had the opportunity to see the magnificence of Eiger, Monsch and Jungfrau in real life. To then see these guys so determined to make it up there - I cannot imagine what drives these people beyond the ordinary limits. A true story, with the impending WWII in the background - it showed in a subtle way, how Nazi Germany was brain-washed into establishing the image of superiority at any cost. The human aspect was lost...!  Fantastic movie! Thank you!
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I couldnt even watch the whole thing.  BAD.  There was no story, no dialog, maybe I am just not artsy or refined enough, but it really sucked, IMO.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Best of its kind. Finally! My daughter played with this app for over an hour first time. At three, she needs a cool yet basic interface. I just deleted about ten other paid apps that were supposed to do what this one does. Awesomeness on my galaxy tab 10.1
B002VRZEYM|4.0|I enjoyed this film, although \\"enjoyed\\" seems wrong when I was on the point of horror for much of it. The film is well-made and persuasive (which is why I give it four stars), although a bit one-sided (which is why I didn't give it five stars). It was very informative, though, and by the end, I was all ready to jump on their bandwagon. But, I like to research the opposing views before making my decisions, so I went to the one-star reviews - and they actually make some good points. While I agree with much of this film's arguments, I think it serves best as a starting point for discussion. So I recommend the film - I think it's right for people to learn more about where their food comes from - but I caution against accepting everything the filmmakers say without looking at opposing views first. (This is a good stand to take on any issue, of course.)
B005974CNA|4.0|It's good. I think they could have brought the drums up more in the mix. Mike Mangini is a phenomenal drummer. The songs are good: good writing, good arrangements, good compositions.

B004EPZ08E|1.0|Don't buy if you want to watch with iTunes, this digital copy is some new fangles UltraViolet digital copy...whatever. I'll have to burn the DVD to my iTunes library.
B005H9B2CE|2.0|I found the story to be choppy and without much to it. The action scenes were okay, but nothing that was amazing. To be fair, I watched it at home and I do not have the best sound-system, so maybe I missed out on some really loud epic moments? I really did not expect much when I rented this movie and I was not surprised with what I got.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Dumbo is a classic.  I bought this movie for my granddaughter who is 4.  She LOVES the movie.  She would probably watch it 24/7 if she could! I would recommend this movie to anybody with children of all ages!
0385534639|1.0|An astonishment, and for all the wrong reasons<br /><br />Two mysterious illusionists have a long tradition of choosing contestants and then pitting them against each other in a display of magical strength.  Why a `long tradition'?  What are the illusionists trying to accomplish by re-staging the same contest over and over?  I admit to doing a lot of skimming (this book is VERY boring), but as far as I know there's never any reason offered for the contests to be repeated, because this is one of those books that never offers much of an explanation for anything.  Why don't the two illusionists just fight it out themselves?  How did this contest tradition get started in the first place?  Who are these guys, anyway?  Dunno.  And why do these guys have unusual abilities?  Is it somewhat common in the world they inhabit, or are the characters in the book unique?  Dunno.  And what exactly is the nature of their abilities?  Any limitations?  Any costs?  Dunno.<br /><br />So, anyway, leaving aside the question of why Morgenstern doesn't even make a little bit of an effort to make her world plausible, we have these illusionists with all kinds of poorly-defined abilities.  Do these powerful people set out to cure cancer?  Journey to Mordor to defeat the Dark Lord?  Build a rocket to the moon?  Nope, they create a circus, because these characters are far too shallow to do anything truly interesting or heroic.  Oh, and the contestants also attend a lot of dinner parties and wear pretty clothes.  In this they are exactly like all the other characters in the book.  Nobody does anything but go to the circus, go to dinner parties, and wear pretty clothes.  No one has any interest in anything but the circus, dinner parties, and pretty clothes.  Oh, sorry.  I forgot - they all like chocolate and cinnamon confections.  Just imagine how exciting these characters are!  I had the sensation of reading a novel about a handful of spineless blind worms wriggling aimlessly across the page.<br /><br />And then there's the exciting plot!  Celia and Marco, the two contestants, know nothing about the nature of the contest, so they - not surprisingly - care nothing about it.  So, if the two contestants care nothing about the contest, why on earth would the reader care?  And this is pretty much the entire plot.  Two contestants, and the game they know nothing about, and care even less about, The End.  The `point' of the book, if `point' isn't far too flattering a term for this slovenly mishmash, is to describe the supposed wonders of the circus.  Yawn.  Really, reduced to its essentials, this is the entire book.  Celia creates an astonishing illusion, and then Marco creates an astonishing illusion.  I just don't get the appeal.  I mean, what is sillier than inventing a bunch of illusions that don't have to have any reality in the actual world, and exist in a fictional world where the author hasn't bothered to introduce any constraints on the magic or to make the fictional world in any way internally coherent?<br /><br />And the writing?  How's this?:<br />Marco pulls her to him in an emerald embrace, so close that no distinction remains between where his suit ends and her gown begins.<br />To Celia, there is suddenly no one else in the room as he holds her in his arms.<br />But before she can vocalize her surprise, his lips close over hers and she is lost in wordless bliss.<br /><br />Yep, it really is that bad.<br /><br />So, what have we here?  Any character in Night Circus is interchangeable with any other character, because they all lack, well, characteristics.  None of them has any hopes or fears or interests or struggles or pretty much anything that would define a character.  These non-characters stumble around purposelessly in a non-plot where nothing much ever happens.  The writing ranges from barely passable to flat out bad.  Anything that would make a novel a novel is simply missing here. Nevertheless, this book has garnered some good reviews and seems to be selling.  It's a mystery.  Must be magic.
B005DZMODI|3.0|I hear a combination of Dixieland/New Orleans jazz and Delta Blues, and I find EC a cross between Satchmo, Tom Waits, and Joe Cocker (whereas usually I find EC to be EC).  No doubt the overall musicianship is fantastic, but I'm not sure this one works for me even though I pretty much like everything that Clapton touches.  I also agree that the recording sound quality could have been better.  The 2005 Cream Reunion CD sound quality is considerably better.  Listening using pair of Altec 19 Voice of the Theatre speakers, heavily-modified Scott 222-d tube amplifier, and Ah Tjoeb 4000 tube cd player.)
B0034G4P80|5.0|I don't get my social values from the movies , they usually espouse the propaganda of its producers; but Thor is pure entertainment and its about one of the Comic book heroes I was most fond of as a teenager. It was made true to the original story line without Sex or profanity, making it suitable for granddaughters to watch with me and share the popcorn. I highly recommend it.
0596522347|4.0|Slideology...  Very Helpful!  This book is easy to read and full of real-life examples.  It is a great book for anyone in the work place who uses the normal PowerPoint presentation to show their material.  The \\"Case Studies\\" found in nearly every chapter connect the content to the people who read it.  The book is full of these examples that exhibit very well the concepts that are explained in its pages.  The set-up of description and example makes this a very easy-to-understand read.  There are several thoughts within the pages of Slideology that the normal presenter would never think of.  The author not only gives ideas, but also suggests ways to improve the visual elements of a PowerPoint in order to best get the point across.    This is a must have book for presenters!
B003Y5H57O|4.0|There always seemed more to the story of John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\". The new 2011 isn't a sequel to Carpenter's classic film which was closer to John W. Campbell's original novella than the 1951 film. In fact, this film plays more like a remake of the 1951 Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks with the way the story is set up and the characters. This 2011 prequel manages to throw in a couple of surprises for fans of the 1982 film while also staying faithful to what we know from the 1982 film. The director and writer bring in a few unique twists and it is surprisingly well cast.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />While tracking a strange signal a group of Norweigans discover an ancient buried spaceship when the ice they are traveling over collapses. Calling in an American Dr. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to help Dr. Sandor Halvorson determine what type of creature they've discovered trapped in the ice. When Halvorson insists on drilling into the cake of ice the creature is trapped in for a tissue sample against Lloyd's advice, they unleash a creature that immitates humans perfectly and is designed to survive something that the Norweigans are NOT prepared to face.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Writer Eric Heisserer does an expert job of reverse engineering the screenplay from what we saw in Carpenter's film about the remains of the creature and the Noreweigan base. While that by itself wouldn't be enough to recommend the film writer Heisserer and director Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr. do an expert job of creating a sense of suspense (although not the feeling of impending doom and dread that Carpenter so expertly puts on display in the 1982 film)even though we know what is coming playing on the fact that the audience may have knowledge while the characters are completely in the dark.<br /><br />There are a couple of minor flaws in the film. One we can't help--it's the fact that we know the outcome (somewhat although the writer and director throw a few surprises into the film at the conclusion)and dramatically that Dr. Lloyd makes a huge leap of logic as to what the creature can do based on a cursorary examination of the cells and the remains of one of the attacked members of the team. While it might work for those who might have seen the 1982 film more casual fans or those who haven't seen the 1982 film will be a bit puzzled by it. Still, that's the worst of the film's sins. The other flaw is that while the casting is quite good for most of the main characters they aren't quite as memorable as those created for the 1982 film and the casting director doesn't have the opportunity to rely on the strong group of American character actors that populate the 1982 film. Still, the the producers and directors do work wonders with the cast that they have particularly Winstead who does a fine job recalling the character of Ripley from James Cameron's \\"Aliens\\" as she takes charge of the group.<br /><br />The director creates a creature that while it recalls what it is in the 1982 film is more brazen and reckless (as something inexperienced with humans might be)when it comes to attacks on members of the crew. We also get explanations as to why certain things occur in the 1982 film that are never fully explained (although they probably didn't need to be).<br /><br />The score by Marto Beltrani adds to the suspense of the film and, at the conclusion, uses Ennio Moricone's classic score from the 1982 film. The CGI and physical effects work very well and visually the creature appears quite unique at times but still recalling what we know of it from the 1982 film.<br /><br />There are certainly those who are going to be disappointed by the prequel but the writers and directors do an exceptional job with what they have to work with and, in some respects, the tone of the film recalls the relationship that exists between the films \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\"; each film shared a central premise but each also goes its own way (although the director herehas much less wiggle room with the story).<br /><br />As a straight forward horror filck the 2011 prequel \\"The Thing\\" is quite good and stays remarkably true to what we see in Carpenter's classic film.<br /><br />Recommended.k the 2011 prequel \\"The Thing\\" is quite good and stays remarkably true to what we see in Carpenter's classic film.   Recommended.
1401307787|5.0|I'm not a self help type person. I'm a high stress type A++ personality who tunes out when people start talking about meditation and spirituality. It's not that I don't believe in these things, but really, who has the time? My mother in law gave me this book for Christmas and it sat under my bed for two years. To cut a long story short I eventually read it and it changed my life. Years later, I am still calm (thanks to this book) and I re-read it when I feel myself starting to slip. I've never read any other spiritual books and I don't need to. If you're like me, then this book could save you. It's simple to read and the effects are immediate. I even got off Xanax for panic attacks when flying thanks to this book. If you're a stress mess, don't wait!

B004EPYZOY|5.0|the trailer made this look like a typical action car movie, so i waited til bluray to see it. HUGE mistake this was one of the best movies i have seen in years. lussier and farmers names should have been promoted more in the trailers. i wish i hadnt waited i want to see it in 3d the way it was meant to be seen.
B002KKCWJU|5.0|Very happy with these.  comfortable enough to run around in.  have birkenstocks also, but wear these much more often.  these are a vast improvement to the last pair of teva's i had in the '90s, with additional soft strips of neoprene at contact points in heel and instep.  better water resistance, with sole taking none in, and straps only minimally, dries fast.  sole has some tread, and is mildly tacky on wet surfaces.  wear them in the park, at the lakeside, and at the ocean.  would definitely recommend these, no problems whatsoever.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|From: Rhonda W.<br />Subject: Fifty Shades Darker<br />Date: October 3, 2011<br />To: E.L. James<br /><br />Well Mrs. James, here I sit having finished yet another of your novels and as I ponder my feelings, I find my words inadequate. As I've stated before, I don't read much erotic, and to add; I don't read a lot of Contemporary Romance either, so for me to dish out 5 stars says a great deal about how I felt about your books. Your story telling is wonderful, and your characterization is outstanding. Your ability to tell your story in the first person POV through Ana's eyes is superb, I never at anytime felt like I was missing anything.<br /><br />Mrs. James, I didn't think it was possible to love Christian anymore than I already did, but you made me fall completely head over heels for him. I loved his depth, and of course his smexyness. I loved watching him go through his self discovery, and revealing himself to Ana piece by piece. And when the final barriers came down, and he relinquished his hard limits to her, at that point my heart was his.<br />There were times I wanted to throttle Ana, but for the most part I like her, and I love that she is able to love him in spite of his baggage, and love him in a way that he's never experienced. There were so many moving moments in this book, and I shed my tears, and my heart clenched, and this was one of the best books I've read this year, I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Keep writing Mrs. James, I'm looking forward to more of your work, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next Fifty book!!!<br /><br />Rhonda W. ABR- Patiently twiddling thumbs
B000NA28IE|5.0|First off, no, I haven't read the book but I totally loved and enjoyed watching this movie with my then, 10 yr old daughter, who, at 16, still loves watching this! I'm not sure why so many panned it because I totally disagree. No, no movie can fit every god conceivable thing that was so good about the book, into the movie. It would make it too long. Oh well, if you're the type who is (that much against) the variances of books to movies, don't watch it (and be horrified)! Just read the reviews and don't waste your time. How about that?
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Beautiful designed program. It has a very old time feel to it. Make sure that you keep track of all those different pieces. Developer don't change a thing.

1612130283|5.0|From: Rhonda W.<br />Subject: Fifty Shades of Grey<br />Date: September 26, 2011<br />To: E.L. James<br /><br />Mrs. James<br />I have finished your novel, and while I'm aware that it was derived from fan fiction, I was a bit apprehensive about reading. It seems that all the shining reviews made me very curious, so I had to go with my gut and take the plunge. While I have read the books that this series was spawn from and loved them very much at the time, I have since moved on, as hand holding and kissing were just not enough... I wanted more. There were scenes, and lines from your book that made me think of that series, maybe it was because I knew ahead of time.<br /><br />I don't read much erotica because frankly, the story lines tend to be cheesy, and characters jump in the sack by page 2. Mrs. James, I really enjoyed this book, from the story, to the erotica. Which is possibly one of the best erotica books I have ever read. I heard Christian's voice from the moment he put his hand in Ana's and helped her to her feet after falling into his office. I can't even begin to tell you how much I loved him. Throughout the book I kept thinking, \\"where do I sign?\\" ;-) I found that I liked Ana very much, I liked how she challenged Christian, and I enjoyed her inner dialog, her inner goddess had me cracking up. I liked how Christian tried to ease her into his world of BDSM, the little things that led up to the first encounter in the playroom. Christian was delicious, and I savored him thoroughly!<br /><br />I'm glad I never read the fan fiction version of this story, because quite frankly, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as I did Christian and Anastasia. Am I curious about it? Absolutely NOT! I love Fifty Shades of Grey just the way it is. I can't remember the last time I smiled this much while reading a book. Mrs. James, you have completely captivated me with this book, and I can't wait to start the next one.<br /><br />Rhonda W.<br />ABR, Ten fingers twitching
B000LTAY1U|2.0|This watch was much smaller and a lot less rugged than the photographs implied. Nonetheless, not a bad watch for the price.
3836527286|5.0|I really like this new book with Linda's photographs, although I knew most of them. But it's okay, because I really do enjoy looking at them, with one exception: the one on the cover. I find Paul's pose rather childish and the photo unrepresentative for Linda's seriousness and talent. I don't see why the authors and editor chose exctly that oh so playful photo (in fact, it's quite bad taste) for the cover of such a beautiful volume. Isn't it a pity...
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Arrived on time, no issues. I'd already seen this series and Blood and Sand, and just wanted to add it to my collection. *RIP Andy Whitfield*
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|When it came around to me to pick our group read, I was in the mood for some good PNR, or urban fantasy. Well, along comes this little book that everyone is reading, loving, and gushing over, including some of our favorite authors. So I figure, \\"what the heck\\" let's give it a go. So I'm all excited, and can't wait to dig into this tempting little treat, and my expectations are now high to start with.<br /><br />So I start reading this book, and I'm liking the writhing, it's working for me. WOAH!! Suddenly I've run into a BIG problem, and It's a big problem for me. You see, I have issues with these kinds of stories that involve the real world. I don't like it when humans know about all the magic. So now I have a mental block with this book, and I'm not digging it. I was pissed off for having spent the money, and having to read this book!<br /><br />Damnedy damnit, color me happy, because about 100 pages in, my feelings for this book turned to LOVE!!! Yes, Thea Harrison made me eat every last negative word I said, and I enjoyed every mouthful!! LOL! I love Harrison's story telling, creativity, and the life she brought to her characters. This is likely the most fun book I've read this year.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into the plot here, it started with a penny and ended with a peanut. Read the blurb. What I do want to go into is the characters who were simply fantastic, they totally made this book. It was filed with goblins, faeries, and different kinds of wyr creatures.<br /><br />Dragos Cuelebre is a dragon that shape shifts into human form. He is pretty much as old as time, and the most powerful, and feared creature in the world. Over thousands years, he has acquired the outrageous wealth and status to go along with that reputation of his. But being surrounded for hundreds of years by employees that caters to his every demand, or desire. This is the life he is accustom to, and apparently finds no issue with it until he meets Pia Giovanni. Pia has found is treasure trove of items he has collected over the years, gotten through all the wards, and locks that were supposed to be impossible to get through, and stolen from him. This puts Dragos in a tailspin of of rage. Determined to find his thief, and pass judgment himself, he finds himself Intrigued more that anything. Intrigued by the fact that the thief was able to find his hidden cache, but was able to actually get to it, and most of all, he's intrigued by her scent that was on the note she left behind. Then he realizes just how bored, and lonely he's been his whole life.<br /><br />I really liked Pia from the beginning with her sassiness, and snappy sense of humor, and the ability to laugh at herself. And I was glad to see she could kick ass too. Pia was raised by her mother who was full Wyr, and Pia is half Wyr, half human. Being to taught her whole life not to form attachments to others, or material possessions, to be able to drop her life and run for self preservation. Because if anyone ever found out what she is, she would be the most hunted person in the world. Pia doesn't even know what she is, and has led a lonely life, and having a constant desire to belong. And having been betrayed by her human ex-boyfriend, it's difficult for her to trust.<br /><br />When Dragos, and Pia collide, (literally) the wheels are set in motion for a crazy and fun ride. And together they are SMOKIN' HOT! I absolutely loved these two together.<br /><br />Now there is also a fabulous cast of secondary characters that I'm sooo looking forward to reading about in future books. Tricks, Rune, Aryal, and Graydon, *Thud*, I wonder how long we'll have to wait for his story. But Tricks Story should be HELLA FUN!!the years, gotten through all the wards, and locks that were supposed to be impossible to get through, and stolen from him. This puts Dragos in a tailspin of of rage. Determined to find his thief, and pass judgment himself, he finds himself Intrigued more that anything. Intrigued by the fact that the thief was able to find his hidden cache, but was able to actually get to it, and most of all, he's intrigued by her scent that was on the note she left behind. Then he realizes just how bored, and lonely he's been his whole life.  I really liked Pia from the beginning with her sassiness, and snappy sense of humor, and the ability to laugh at herself. And I was glad to see she could kick ass too. Pia was raised by her mother who was full Wyr, and Pia is half Wyr, half human. Being to taught her whole life not to form attachments to others, or material possessions, to be able to drop her life and run for self preservation. Because if anyone ever found out what she is, she would be the most hunted person in the world. Pia doesn't even know what she is, and has led a lonely life, and having a constant desire to belong. And having been betrayed by her human ex-boyfriend, it's difficult for her to trust.  When Dragos, and Pia collide, (literally) the wheels are set in motion for a crazy and fun ride. And together they are SMOKIN' HOT! I absolutely loved these two together.  Now there is also a fabulous cast of secondary characters that I'm sooo looking forward to reading about in future books. Tricks, Rune, Aryal, and Graydon, *Thud*, I wonder how long we'll have to wait for his story. But Tricks Story should be HELLA FUN!!
B005J2UM9S|2.0|When I first saw the trailer on you tube prior to the release I was really excited. The first 2/3rds of the movie was entertaining  and seemed to be building very well into something worthy of the views time... then it falls apart into a total and utter amateur disappointment. Like the failed Lonely Island pilot for Fox \\"Awesometown\\" amateur disappointment or a really bad student project for an After Effects class disappointment.<br /><br />The film starts off with 5 people shooting a Ghost Hunting TV show, who lock themselves in a haunted, abandon mental institution which looks way to clean to have been abandon for more then a few days, which can be over looked. Trouble starts as the crew is beginning to wrap shooting up for the evening. Typical ghost hunting show type stuff starts happening and suspense starts to build at a decent pace and we start to see the interesting scenes from the trailer. Shortly after the scene from the trailer where the girl turns around and morphs into a creature is where the wheels completely fall off the bus. At the point where hands start coming out of the walls and ceiling is when it's time to shut it off because it marks the point where this film turns into little more then an amateur remake of the Blair Witch Project complete with the camera dropping to the floor, off screen ending with screaming to imply what is happening to the final victim.<br /><br />I truly had high hopes for this film after seeing the trailer and the leaps that digital video has had over the past few years. The real problem is the non-climax and \\"been done before\\" ending. Truly an utterly disappointing, I can see why it's only available on Pay-Per-View and didn't have a true theatrical release. Not worth the money to rent, maybe check it out when it eventually makes it to the SyFy Channel for free. 2 stars because I was enjoying myself in the beginning before it completely fell apart.

0307887898|5.0|The book came very quickly after ordering it; in just a small week it was already laying in my post box. I've just read the first pages, and it seems quite interesting thus far ;-)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's voice automatically soothes me, I never skip a song. Shes such an incredible talent, you will not regret buying her CD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So different from anything I have ever read before, but I was hooked from page one. What a different and interesting concept. Worth reading again and I can't wait to start the second one.
B00008FRMQ|5.0|I put that as the review title so, people wouldn't get confused. There are a million special edition versions of this CD, but mine is just the basics. Which is suprisingly okay, given that this is a whole lot of excellent music. I only knew like half the songs on here, but the songs are all pretty good and balanced. I also partly picked this up, because a lovely female friend of mine thinks Mr. Costello is the best musician ever. If you've never heard Mr. Costello, he sort of seems comical. The best way to describe what he sounds like is Tom Petty mixed with Devo. Actually, I'm not saying anything bad about him. If you are getting into his style of music, then get \\"My Aim Is True\\" or \\"13 Steps Lead Down\\" along with this disc. Those are good for, if you know his music, but haven't really listened to entire CDs yet. Well, this CD itself is all great songs. The sound quality is also, fantastic considering the age of the recording and the fact it's not remastered.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Owned since 2008, purchased 3 to have around the house and bug out bag.  I have been using this sharpener for years now. It quickly became a favorite with a wide sharpening area that even my thick D2 steal knives can fit. I have taken these on deployments to the middle east and have them in my Bug out bag. However, on a recent trip I pulled out the diamond rod to sharpen a kitchen knife. The plastic holding the rock broke and separated. No joke, it's just molded plastic holding that fragile rod on. I was surprised and bummed somewhat because I like this sharpener a lot. I still kept both pieces hoping to glue them back together. However I will be removing this item from my bug out bag as I need something I can rely on.  I hope Smith's can make a metal version on this sharpener as it would not be hard to do out of block aluminum.

B004G25V9S|3.0|I waited to write this review hoping my opinion would change after listening to the album enough and seeing them play it live. Well, my opinion hasn't changed (although the songs from the album do sound better live). Opeth has always had a special place in my heart because they were the band that opened the door for me into new territories of metal. Before Opeth, I couldn't stand music with growls in it. But Damnation opened my mind to Opeth then Still Life and My Arms Your Hearse opened up the darker and beautiful side of heavy music.  But this album fails in alot of ways. With Damnation, Opeth (or rather Mikael I should say) wrote their first complete album with no growls and not really any of the crunchy metal tones. BUT it alienated very few of its original core metal base because the songs were so dark and so well written. They managed to keep the Opeth sound but present it in a new way. Heritage fails in this respect. The style is somewhat new, and you can still hear the some of the \\"Opeth\\" sound, but now it has random and unrelated other \\"sound\\" thrown in with it. One of the things that throws it off is their choice for an overdrive sound on their guitars thats pretty lame. When a song on this album gets to a point where it naturally seems it should get heavy and you are ready for the tension to release... instead you get something only half way there with the lack of distortion.  I'm not sure what feeling/message Mikael was going for but its coming out garbled. On a song like Folklore, the first half of the song is amazing, but then you get to the second half and its like... huh you decided to go there with it and it ruins the song. Thats the on going story of the album. Opeth does the melancholy sound very well but they are trying to mix in something else that just doesn't quite fit in. On what i guess is the big song of the album, Devil's Orchard, you basically get everything thats wrong with this album all in one song. Opeth's sound here is something likejazz-fusion/70s prog rock with the lame overdrive sound throughout and very keyboard-heavy backing. In my opinion, jazz is awesome but jazz-fusion is about as bad as music gets. Hopefully if a more jazz inspired sound is what they are going for in the future, they approach it from a whole different way.   I have alot respect Opeth for trying something new (and they are willing to fail -- as I witnessed seeing them live as some of their fans left the venue early). That takes some balls, Mikael even joked about it on stage. The positive note of this album is that the playing is great as always (although they really need to replace the current drummer, never seen someone fail so terribly at a drum solo live). If you are new to Opeth, go back in their catalogue and listen to one of their classics (My arms your hearse through Ghost Reveries) and be in awe of how perfect those were and how much Heritage falls short.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Game is runs exceptionally well on vizio tablet. Controls are well, graphics are 8 bit, but 8 bit non interlaced (HD). The worth the price, and highly addictive..
B002ZG98UK|5.0|don't believe in the term \\"guilty pleasure.\\" At least, not with regard to movies. Maybe if you were a connoisseur of baby seal steaks or hoodies made from pandas, the attribution would be appropriate, but not when talking about one's taste in films. Take Paul W.S. Anderson's body of work--I'm kind of an easy lay when it comes to his Resident Evil films for reasons both concrete and maddeningly difficult to articulate. They're glossily shot with (at least with Anderson or as with RE: Extinction's Russel Mulchahey behind the camera) and promise at least a few engaging setpieces featuring series lead Milla Jovovich in some kind of improbable action, possibly kicking dogs in the face as her character Alice navigates whatever bizarre and occasionally goofy developments are thrown her way by the increasingly slapdash evil conspiracies at the heart of the series.  I love the series because at its heart, it's a great big silly (okay dumb, but sincere) bit of fun, obviously made for and by geeks (I don't mean this pejoratively) who are really into the games. Each entry promises some truly bizarre development for the subsequent sequel that never full materializes.  Case in point: after the opening shootout in an underground, Japanese facility operated by the Umbrella Corporation--the baddies who created the T-Virus and Alice's former employers--Afterlife quickly dispenses with the more interesting developments from the end of the last film and puts our heroine back on the trail of Claire (Ali Larter) and the remaining survivors from the last installment. With most of the Earth's population decimated by the zombie plague, survivors have been following an automated beacon to Alaska, where they're promised food, shelter, and most importantly, no zombies. Unfortunately, the life Alice is able to find at the site is a feral, dirty Claire, whose memories have been wiped thanks to an insect-like device embedded in her chest.
