B009UX2YAC|5.0|(by my 11 year old daughter who has jut bought her first Kindle Fire) I loved playing sub way suffers. It was so cool that I spent the first 3 days only playing IT instead of all my other games!!! Okay maybe I played minecraft a little but your got to admit their both great games!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|It wasn't a bad movie, however it was a bit darker than I expected. Plenty of recognizable elements... just different. Some things do fall short. Nice attempt to reboot, but if you like Christopher Reeve's portrayal of character wait until this one comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray. The IMAX experience non 3D is very overrated, I was not impressed with IMAX. It was so loud I almost left but had no where to go. If I had to grade the movie I'd give it a middle B. If it says anything, I will add Superman Man of Steel to my DVD collection.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Very good book and will help me a lot.<br />All I have to say is thank the Lord that this dictionary is on my kfhd
B0026QC0TA|4.0|I love the fact that there still might be a lawyer or two who really remember why lawyers are supposed to exist and who they're to serve. I was really impressed with the desire for Justice in the courts. Don't care for Danny (the radical Hugo Chavez) lover, but the movie overall was great!
0785152466|4.0|I absolutely adored the first one. This one is almost as good. I think the ending is weaker and the overall tone is less humorous than the first, but it's still a winner. Romita Jr's artwork is a major draw for me, and even though some of the coloring is inconsistent, it's not distracting.<br /><br />By the end of the book I found out there was a prequel I should have read called \\"Hit-Girl\\". I assume it chronicles what takes place between Kick-Ass 1&2 - I am reading it next.<br /><br />If you loved the first Kick-Ass book, then this is a must read. The only problem I had is that after reading the first one, I knew what to expect, so the violence and plot twists did not amaze and astound me as they did the first time, but this is still a great installment of a modern classic.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Paul delivers big time with this Duets CD. All the cuts are great. Highly recommend. The price of this CD was worth the hours of entertainment it gives me.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Seen it many times and I can't get tired of it. Fantastic movie except for some of the strange characters in Xerxes quarters. What was that goat thing playing the flute? And the guy with blades for arms. That kind of turned me off. The rest of it was spectacular. Stay with the facts. They make this movie great. The factual history of this is enough. You don't need poetic license to make this movie great. Overall, great movie.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I've read many of Neil,s books and have rarely been disappointed.<br /><br />His imagination hold no bounds, once you start reading it's hard to stop.<br /><br />The story is an homage to the place  Neil was born.<br /><br />This is the first time I've ever paid more than 10$ for an E Book and I'm not sorry, it's that good....even better<br /><br />get the Audio edition as well, and hear the gifted Author /narrator tell the story.
B00992CF6W|1.0|The update is terrible! You have to pay money to play with people now. If you're reading this review and haven't got the update yet,<br /> don't get it!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I am not the type to read books like this but OMG I could not put it down. The first book was so naughty that I was embarassed reading it but then I didnt care and have told even my mother to read it and even bought her the first book.
0062014536|3.0|This was a disappointing conclusion to a series that started out really well.  Essentially very little happens til the last 1/4 or so of this book.  There is almost no interaction with Alex until the very end when all of a sudden both of them come to some miraculous realization.  Even the interactions with Julian are mundane.  This book is only redeemed by Hana's POV (otherwise only 2 stars worthy) and even that is left so open-ended that it's annoying. The invalids, which are portrayed as weak and worn out through majority of this story, also have some sudden surge of adrenaline and take down a wall and begin reclaiming the city.  It's annoying because the reader has no prespective on the rest of the country, very little on the world situation (brief mention of Canada) so it's hard to gauge this victory.  Essentially, a series about love and passion and freedom to choose has Lena acting completely jaded and emotionless througout and the love triangle has completely fizzled out with both boys.  Unfortunate because first two books were engaging.
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|This is a great game.<br />No, I don't know why they have some extra permissions and really don't care; probably just neglected to set config properly.<br />What in the world do you think the developer is going to do?  Go to various cities and see if they can track/stalk someone?  Ridiculous.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|If you like the &#34;takk&#34; album, this is in the same style. If you've been a fan for a week or a decade it doesn't disappoint.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games like this that make you think...it exercises your brain and is kind of like a mystery/logic game! I couldn't stop playing it when I downloaded it...I am ready for more levels! Keep em coming!
1442344288|5.0|I'm still in the middle of this story and sometimes I can't wait to get in the car and drive again just so I can find out what happens next.
093183841X|5.0|I am very happy with this price guide. It has twice as many pages as my previous 1995-1996 edition with more cameras, photos  and detailed  information on the cameras. It is well worth the price.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|My sister suggested this after I asked her what I should replace Google Reader with.  I like it.<br />Better than Google Reader
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Awesome and funny movie. I would rent this movie again and again. Hands down the best movie since 'knocked up'.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There's no other way I would describe this book. I bought it and it took me a while to read it. It took me some time to get into  it but once I learned about the characters and their problems I was hooked. I read 60% of this book in 5 hours at work. I cried  I laughed I said as out loud. there were parts in this book when it reminded,me of my family or life. Probably one of my favorite books. I will read this again and again.,It really touched me. The details in this book make you really understand what it going on and you feel like your with the characters!,work of art
B007IXWKUK|5.0|awesome book cant wait to start reading the third one you must buy this trilogy great books E.L. James is a amazing author
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome I love Minecraft  and if you have an Xbox and you have Minecraft but you can't play just download this!

B008JFUPK8|4.0|Man of Steel<br />Henry Cavill was just as perfect a Superman as Christopher Reeves!  Prologue vignettes of Clark saving people before donning the suit were magnificent as well as his heroic self discipline not to abuse his powers akin to the newest (ie best) rendition of Amazing Spider-Man 2012.  However, the 20 minutes of wasted time during the fight scene to simply demonstrate special effects was a tedious waste of time akin to derailment that constituted Transformers 3 and Inception.  Hollywood still does not realize that action is fine if it fits the story as with Eagle Eye.  A believable Superman would have diverted Zod to the ocean or desert away from the urban populace to minimize risks to life and infrastructure assets.  We want a story, not crap action if action is pointless and noncontributory.<br /><br />Also, America consists of whites, blacks, Asians, latinos...  Normal Americans embrace that all law abiding citizens are equal.  Akin to Brad Pitt's boss in World Wide Z being black, Avengers re-written to make Nick Fury black, President and 2nd in command in 2012 being black, making the general black and colonel white while simultaneously rewriting comic lore for 70+ years to make Perry White a black is insulting as Hollywood pushes their agenda without cause.  We are all equal and if Hollywood truly believed this then they would not pander to solicit approval.  All of the black actors were fantastic and incredibly skilled but I tire of the unsolicited Hollywood repetative agenda.<br /><br />Finally, I encourage all viewers to embrace a one year boycott of all distracting advertising during movies that WE PAY TO VIEW as paying for advertising in the midst of our movies is insulting to the viewer and detracts from the continuity of enjoying the film.  IHOP was advertised no less than 3 times during the movie and Sears was distinctly advertised once with the camera fixated on the Sears logo. For one year from my 6/22/13 viewing I will refuse to enter IHOPor Sears such that companies realize that by submitting to maximizing Hollywood profits they will minimize their own profits by consensus public boycott.  We can teach Hollywood not to sacrifice the story line by intrusive inappropriate advertising.<br /><br />In conclusion, Man of Steel, if one ignores the wasteful protracted action fight scene, contrived \\"need\\" to terraform Earth despite the infinite planets accessible via the movie's hyperspace drive (see: contrived conflict between Zod and Kal El simply to justify combat action protracted event), redundant and unnecessary racial messaging, and inappropriate money hungry advertising, was great!<br /><br />If Director Snyder learns from his mistakes and keeps same actors for Clark and Lois with greater attention to the human component (the essence of science fiction) then I cannot wait for the sequel(s)!!!<br /><br />Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were so truly fantastic, however, that I have to grant 4 stars despite Snyder's questionable skills.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Sabotage has great power in its entirerty but the songs are not overwellmingly great.It seams the follow up to SBS was not to be the same masterpice type thinking- a bunch of songs that may indicate the break down of sabbath as a writing force- i love all sabbath so this album is cool but disjointed-
B008Y73940|5.0|not sure what i was expecting- but it was interesting none the less- good for a rainy afternoon day watch
B00CQGU9GG|1.0|WHAT?  I WAITED 28 YEARS FOR THIS!! Waiting and waitng for someone to put my favorite ZZ TOP albums on cd-After the mess of the six pack recordings and singels i purchased i am into it for a lot money with no music to show for it-but when heard the crap sound vs. the remasters by RHINO i was livid! Struggling to enjoy the listening experience i thjought i was going insane until i put on RHINO RE-MASTERS- Will someone please RE-MASTER TEJAS/ZZ ONE/RIO MUDD. The packaging was so lame-no liner notes,cardboard sleaves w/ no inner sleave- worse than album transfer sound! I did return my box set- so dissapointed!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The story can be used to teach kids about empathy, kindness, and diversity. Loved the way the author incorporated everyone's point of view. Great summer read for kids grades 3-8.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|A great story, great effects, great coloring...<br /><br />VERY MUCH frustrated with the paternal, dominant themes in the movie. I feel like there might have been a way to convey this story without such STRONG only this \\"man\\" can save the day stuff...but i'm pretty sure it's based on the original series...which would have made a lot of sense for that time period. It just really rubbed me the wrong way while I watched it and the \\"witches\\" being so submissive and/or evil
B00CATSONE|4.0|Never heard of Tesla all through my public school years.  It was Edison, Edison, Edison.  Nikola to this day hasn't received the acclaim that is his.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|IIt was great the dvds in Spanish and English language. 10+rated ,it's ashame these weren't available 30 years ago, well I love this show it's just Great, thanks again.
075669812X|5.0|Purchased one for my son and another to give as a gift to his friend. This was an awesome purchase because they have sat together for a few hours now just reading and discussing the different characters. Put away the electronics and grab a good reader.... Love it!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|GPS and Network permissions for a simple board game? No thank you!<br /><br />I'm surprised amazon isn't better at filtering this garbage especially as FAOTD.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Enough said.  Developer, FIX this or send me your personal location every half hour or so and, you may as well send me a pic, too....
1781162646|4.0|I must admit, I enjoyed reading this bit of nostalgia from a paperback. In a way it added authenticity. I do miss the variety of small local bookstores that have now disappeared, but this fine effort will not forstall the inevitable. Because of convenience, I rarely buy real books anymore. I think, because of that, I order many more books that I don't finish then when I bought them in bookstores. It's simply too easy to give up on a book and delete it then when it is sitting on your nightstand. I don't like Dick Cheney, but the comment about him at the end of the book was gratuitous. The author spends 283 pages creating a profoundly emotional story, and then almost ruins it in one sentence with a silly political aside.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Just like Mario but no &quot;woohoo aha&quot; nonsense. Controls are actually pretty good. I've only played 5 or so levels but hopefully the design is varied. Anyway, the game is pretty good considering the price.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This is not a Die Hard movie.  It's a poor excuse for a generic action movie that's full of cliches,  worn out one liners,  and horrible effects.  Stay away.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great family movie! Lots of action and adventure! Our family loved it. Great special effects and picture quality, no annoying buffering  thanks amazon!
B008JFUPOY|4.0|When it comes to animation, Disney's Pixar is second to none.  Pixar continues to one-up itself by producing impressive animation, while incorporating interesting stories for children...and adults.  Typically, animated features are catered towards children, yet certain films aren't necessarily as widely popular as others.  For instance, Toy Story continues to be adored by children, while also maintaining critical acclaim.  Oddly enough, Pixar's first creation (Toy Story) is still the benchmark for future productions - not just for Disney, but also for rival animators DreamWorks (Shrek) and Illumination Entertainment (Despicable Me).  The future of Pixar appears to be extremely bright as they focus on creating fresh new ideas while still revisiting popular characters from the worlds of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and the newly released Monsters Inc. prequel, Monsters University.<br /><br />Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprise their roles as Mike Wazowski and Sully Sullivan (respectively) in Monsters University, telling the story of their first meeting and the events leading to their friendship.  Mike believes he's destined to be a professional \\"scarer,\\" but no one finds him to be even remotely scary, despite his endless knowledge on the subject.  On the other hand, Sully comes from a well-known family of scarers, and believes he doesn't need to study to become a success.  After instantly becoming rivals, Mike and Sully are both kicked out of the scare program for their short-comings, and are forced to work together to earn their way back.  Mike makes a deal with the university headmistress, Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), to allow them to reenter the program if their \\"joke\\" of a fraternity, Oozma Kappa (OK), wins the schools scare competition.  The OK fraternity must walk the tough path to victory as a team and prove their doubters wrong or face further embarrassment from their already harsh critics.<br /><br />After a boatload of hoop-jumping, another Monsters film has finally arrived.  But, was it worth the wait?  It's a bit of a complex question, but the short answer is yes.  It's not as though there have been a shortage of quirky animated films during the 12 absence of Mike and Sulley, but in case you haven't been able to tell by the long lines of people waiting to see Monsters University - the duo has clearly been missed by fans.  Did it take too long for a sequel (prequel) to arrive?  Of course, it did.  However, good things come to those who wait, and for the most part, your patience will have paid off when you're in your seat, preparing for the bright colors to attack your eyes.  And, rest assured - the disdainful feeling that has mounted over the years between films will evaporate, leaving you to enjoy a film that remains loyal and true to the wondrous characteristics of the first film.<br /><br />John Goodman and Billy Crystal pick-up as though they had never left off, quickly going from best friends in the first film to rivals in the prequel.  It was a bit of a shocking turn of events, but it makes for a much more ambitious plot as opposed to the simple idea that the pair would best friends from childhood.  These two characters come together in a very unlikely scenario, which is the major reason this film turns out to be as interesting as it is.  Surprisingly, there really isn't any hardnosed villain to battle in this film as there was in the first film (even though Steve Buscemi does return as the future evil-doer, Randall Boggs).  This film is more about Mike and Sulley being forced to work together for a common goal:  to win a competition in order to take one step closer to achieve their dream of becoming a scarer.<br /><br />Monsters University is a typical theme-driven film that puts the main characters in the usual situation of having to look outside themselves and rely on others for help.  Both of the main characters know what they want to achieve, but life serves up roadblocks for them and if they apply themselves, they can achieve their goals regardless of the unforeseen hurdles.  Speaking of hurdles, competition plays a major factor in the lives of these characters once again - as it did in the beginning of the first film with the scare competition.  Monsters University features the Scare Games for roughly half of the film, including events focusing on the importance of teamwork, rather than focusing on individual accolades.  However, the premise is the same as the majority of other group competition films, with the OK fraternity being outsiders and dysfunctional at first, then learning how to come together and function as a team.<br /><br />Overall, Monsters University is equally as enjoyable as its predecessor, combining bright colors with an enjoyable plot, not to mention plenty of laughs along the way.  The plot makes for an interesting dynamic, meshed with a successful narrative that bridges the gap from the beginning of the duo's college career to the beginning of Monsters Inc.  Although it's still a bit questionable that Disney chose to do a prequel rather than a sequel, it's still a film that anyone can enjoy - even if you didn't see the first film.  Mike and Sully are just as enjoyable as before, meaning their return to the big screen will easily appease the fans.  Monsters University has been slated to be a box office powerhouse from the moment it was announced and it will clearly content for the title of the highest grossing animated film of 2013.<br /><br />Grade:  B<br />FNDNreview.comselves, they can achieve their goals regardless of the unforeseen hurdles.

B000FCK65W|5.0|This book was so wonderful to read.  It gave me a look at life in the early 1900 in Brooklyn.  It was hopeful, and exciting to read the way that people coped before welfare in this country.  I loved that it was written from a child's point of view through her life into adulthood.  It was painful to read the lack of support, but encouraging to read about the resourcefulness of strong characters to overcome adversity.  What a treat to read this great novel.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I liked it enough to see it through, but just that much no more, not my favorite movie in the world

B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Why does it need acces to my location and phone calls? This a suspicious app.  I wouldnt download this app.
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|Handrite is great if you just want to jot a quick note with your finger or stylus, however, at least on my Kindle Fire, anything longer than a paragraph or two is hard for the app to handle. It starts reacting slowly and once you get over a page, it really struggles to keep up. Personally, I just use a different app for those longer notes.<br />I really like being able to just make a quick handwritten note so I can look back at it later without having to mess with the keyboard. I had a little trouble with the autoinsert at first, but after customizing my settings, it works well for me now.

1400049628|1.0|I enjoy the Zombie genre of writing and looked forward to having this on the new iPad. I listened intently waiting for the interesting bits to start and I waited......... After a  lengthy period  I closed down the machine and did something else. I can't say what I didn't like in detail although there was no hook to drag you into the story. Where was the interest? I couldn't identify with the narrator and some of this was like listening to someone preparing a back story which never appeared in the full sense of a novel. Some of the ideas were good although never fully materialised. This idea and that idea came up and moved on to another idea.....Oh Lord, I'm pleased that I don't have to tell the husband what I spent on the audiobook.....a waste of money!
1609611543|4.0|It was very informative and has a lot of recipes included.  Those who are grain sensitive and don't realize their problem will be helped.
B0006L5RXS|5.0|This is a great bargain. A diverse range of music from one group at a low price. Also, it is nice to stroll down memory lane.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Every older teenager and adult needs to see this movie.  It's very realistic of inner city life and has fine actors playing the parts. It's also very educational concerning generational welfare mindsets and all the issues that usually go with it.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Good movie, very short but action packed. Plot was very thin and predictable. I wish the story was deeper but the action and fight sequences were good and enjoyable.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dex ter just keeps getting better.  Am a little embarrassed I like the show, but Michael C. Hall makes Dexter sympathetic.  He is a very complicated character.  When the price goes down I will buy Season Seven.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|This CD is done with a variety off solo and CCR stuff. Has a great C&W flavor and a whole new way to listen. He is as good now vocally as he ever was which amazes me with the type of strong raspy voice he has. He is truly blessed with that. Love this
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love this game. Just don't like timed quests and paying for all the pearls I have to use to open all the treasure chests. I play for my own entertainment and only when I have down time. Maybe we should be able to purchase pearls with sand dollars as well. FRUSTRATED!!!!!
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|Peter Sellers plays multiple parts in this dark comedy of how despite supposed safeguards, a high ranking military officer thwarts the system and launches an attack on Russia. Despite the comedy element provided by Sellers and George C. Scott, the underlying element of insufficient safeguards provides a clear warning that the Atomic Weapons available to the Super Powers carries without SERIOUS responsibilities and consequences.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I feel this book leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Too many perspectives and not enough action. I do not recommend this book. I hope the movie is better.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good story line.  I enjoyed this movie.  Actress is a good actor.  Just like the book.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B00005BJPO|5.0|At first I was skeptical; I  generally dislike any anime film that isn't Hayao Miyazaki or studio ghibli (I prefer anime series) but after hearing all the wonderful things about the film I gave in. I bought the special edition DVD and every volume of the manga (6 in total) . I don't regret it one bit.<br /><br />The character development, plot, animation, and action are what really make this an amazing movie. Despite being over 20 years old the animation competes with today's standards. As for the character development, you couldn't possibly develop a character in 2 hours more than what was done with Tetsuo. By the end you both hate him and feel somewhat sorry for him. While both the character development and tiny details of the plot are better portrayed in the manga, the film does a fantastic job of compressing 6 volumes into a 2 hour movie.<br /><br />Overall great movie don't pass it up
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|First, a fantastic movie. Add to that an incredible Ultraviolet system (cloud storage) so that we can re-watch this classic on all of our mobile devices, anywhere.

B007XHWROK|1.0|people buying his cd is throwing money down the drain - people simply just spending money on a pretty face (he isnt drop dead gorgeous), even if he was, i would rather waste money on something else than a pretty face.  bieber fans, ask yourselves, what talents does he has. Even britney spears cant sing, cant write but at lease she is a good dancer. justin bieber cant even dance. i dont a hater, just thinks he is beyond over-rated.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have been a Michael Buble fan since the beginning and so far have really enjoyed the new album.  Several of the songs on this album are performed with Naturally 7, an acappella group that opens for Michael's shows.  I thought Reese Witherspoon was an odd choice for the duet &#34;Somethin' Stupid,&#34; but it sounded okay.  On the other hand, the duet with Bryan Adams is fantastic, as is the single &#34;It's a Beautiful Day&#34; that's been all over the radio.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a good read and kept me hooked until the end.  However, I only read it because my daughter asked me whether she could read it and I wanted to see what it was about.  I'm not a fan of the premise of the book and didn't feel my 15 y.o. needed to read such a heavy book at her age.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|If you're looking to simply pass on pictures to your children, then it will do the job.  Though time consuming, my flatbed scanner produces a better quality image than the negative scanner (and there are not any scratches on my negatives).  For the best quality, although expensive, I was better off taking the negatives to Walmart to have them put on a CD.<br /><br />You need to insert a plastic piece into the scanner in which the negative passes through.  If the plastic piece is scratched, then it will show up on every negative.  Supposedly I bought mine new and peeled off the sticker, but it is still scratched.  I am absolutely frustrated with the poor quality of this product.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|It failed to load or function correctly.  Gave a message shortly after  it started that it was shutting down. App never provided a way to setup/configure.  Waste of time for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is fun and addicting I cant get enough of playing non stop you should play this right now

B001DF68MA|3.0|I bought this for my one year old so she doesnt feel left out. The decription said for up to 4 years old and I dont think it will last past 2. It looks like it is made for a doll. She likes riding in it but going to have to find something else in a few months.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enough challenge to keep you interested without being frustrating. Graphics were beautiful and the videos were a nice touch! Worked flawlessly on my Galaxy Note 2.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|This album is not geared towards your typical retard/pseudo-metal head that is just obsessed with heavy.  That kind of attitude metal is very disgraceful and ignorant.  This album is true music, true metal, metal with a progressive twist that is NOT afraid to go back to the roots of metal when there was actually just 1 incredible frontman and singer, no screaming.  People have lost appreciation for this and they all tend to treat screaming as a MUST for any metal band.  This band shoves that mentality totally to the side with this album and beats it to a pulp.<br /><br />If you are looking for:<br />-Metal with taste for sound<br />-Fabulous vocal performance<br />-A KILLER RECORDED BASS TONE<br />-Syncopation, relaxing grooves, intense grooves<br />-Ethereal layering to the ears, creating soundscapes for one's mind to absorb and think deep things as a result<br />-Relaxing vibes<br />-Another band to add to your arsenal of ACTUAL outstanding progressive metal bands<br />-Drummer's music/Guitar nerds alike<br />-Something other than screaming for a change<br />-A band that is from the UK by chance?  Kidding, location doesn't matter.<br /><br />You should find yourself thoroughly enjoying this album.<br /><br />Even if this album peaks your interest, but your ears do NOT really enjoy it, you should either KEEP ON listening or STOP.<br /><br />This music is not easy to get into.  I can see where some people lack motivation to listen to this type of music, and I will be honest, the first time I heard most of the music that I enjoy today: I hated it, too.<br /><br />A good example was Periphery's first album, I just had a hard time, but then I learned to appreciate their approach and all that they were doing.  (Shameless plug for Periphery and their SECOND album which was easily the best album of past few years in metal)<br /><br />Keep your eye on this band, they are heading for some awesome sounds.<br /><br />If you like this band, you may also enjoy the music of bands like Karnivool, Twelve Foot Ninja, and Periphery.  Not always relative per se, but relative in the fact that they are all doing something unique with their music.<br /><br />If it's not unique, then tell me what does music bring to the table then?  If is nothing to be interesting to the ears, than shouldn't we simply dismiss all of the filler music from our lives?<br /><br />Think different, listen different.<br /><br />This album is 5/5 for what it is.<br /><br />I'm not a fan boy of Tesseract by any means, and I have no extensive history of listening to the band, I am simply giving you my 2 cents on THIS release as it stands, and my review about is all I wanted to let people in on.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Happy hunting (for the music that your heart, mind, and soul yearns to hear).
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I would recommend this book for couples and parents. It will make your life so much better and you can help others.cret
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is AWESOME  if I could rate it 1 out of 12 I would give it a 199.9999 I would make it 200 but I'll let you decide whether or not that it's that great. it makes time fly  GET THE GAME  IT's  WORTH  IT . I m level 10 and have not had to spend a dime actually a penny on this thing the only thing this thing got out of me was my undivided attention you should get the game
B00BKTWBMA|1.0|Are you stressed and can't sleep?  Are you an insomniac?  Put this on your iPod and you will be in dreamland in a heartbeat.  This happened to me two nights in a row because it was so boring and I call it audio valium.  I'm glad I did not buy it and had borrowed it from the library.  EC's voice is scratchy and the guitar work is totally without punch.  I deleted it from my iPod and am going back to my classical music collection to relax and fall asleep instead.  Time to call it a day Eric.  This album called my nights.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This is a good game to pass the time, however the lags, prices, and ridiculous &quot;Must Do&quot; list are what is troublesome. This is my 2nd time playing and am not happy about many things. The first time I played I had everything completed. I had all main 6, all bugs gone, and no shadow spots. I was even able to get things like the toy shop for free, Soran, the giant clock tower, Celestia statue, and many other things with gold coins. But do to technical difficulties I had to start all over from scratch and now seeing that many items that I had I can NO LONGER GET! I am very disappointed that I had to start over and even more with what I have to do now in order to get things back. I am also disappointed in the balloon pop games. For many ponies you have to play this balloon pop game to win any random pony, BUT even though it says you can Win A Pony you MIGHT NOT GET A PONY! So this means you've just wasted 25 hard earned gems for 3 of the dumbest prizes that you get on the Free Balloon Pop. Same goes with the other balloon game, 30 hearts to win what you think are gems, or elements. But no, you also get worthless prizes from that too. Many times you will get things like the giant clock tower, Celestia statue, even Luna's chariot, as prizes. But, when the mission asks you to actually get one of these things you can't get them from your inventory, Oh No! You have 50 large clock towers that you've won from this game in your inventory and you can't even use them to complete the mission! You have to actually go to the shop and Use Gems to get an ugly clock tower that you would never even want! It is upsetting, aggravating, and to think this is also For Little Kids! I do like the game but am getting to a point where I don't. These problems and more are what make this game not worth it!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This app is great. you have training missions and multiplayer(thebest). u can upgrade the guns and buy new ones. there are always people on and never boring. only thing is u have to download twice since its mulitplayer and takes some room up but great app gameloft!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great game. A lot of fun. It is a great way to kill time and stimulate your brain at the same time.
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|The additions of the graphic novel touches here make this ultimate director's cut complete. I have long been a fan of this grossly underrated and ignored cult classic and was thrilled to have it on BR. Walter Hill displays here his deft touch for action sequences and of course, the journey of the vastly outnumbered Warriors as they try to make it back to Coney Island from deep inside enemy territory is as engrossing as ever.<br /><br />Buy it. Watch it. It's one of the best examples of a book to movie there is.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This long version of the movie without a doubt confirms it's the best sub war movie ever. A few spoken lines here and there appear to be \\"toned down\\" for content. The English Subtitle doesn't match the audio very good. Personally for me the best audio is still the Theatrical Version of 150 or so minutes long. I have that on VHS and wish it would be put out on DVD. Good job to the cast, crew, and most of all the actual participants whose stories allowed Wolfgang Petersen to make this movie.
B008JFLWLE|1.0|The upgrades killed it. Doesn't recognize my writing any more. Deleted. It started out working great. Not worth your time.
B001H9JBW6|1.0|I wanted to like this I like the actors, and it was very well done, but the plot line is very heavy handed and feels very forced. The propaganda aspect really smacks you in the face. It was a real downer. Watch something else, you will be glad.
0812983459|3.0|I thought that the book started out well and I enjoyed some of the &#34;journey&#34;. However, by the time Harold reached his destination, I was ready for it to be &#34;over&#34;! Also could not understand why he just didn't tell those that began to walk with him, &#34;This is my journey and I prefer to do this alone!&#34; Some of the events seemed &#34;contrived&#34;.
B008OOYALE|1.0|They only let you get three dragons before you have to pay real money. Unless your .rich don't buy this game
159463176X|5.0|I don't know how this author does it, but I got so focused on the book right from the beginning, that I could hardly put it down! I reread parts, just to be sure I was keeping all characters in my mind. I loved the loyalty that characters showed to one another and I was especially happy with the ending. Doing the right thing, though it may be hard at times;may be sad, does pay off! It was a wonderful read! Could not put it down, but hated to see it end!
B000T0XEGS|4.0|The DVD arrived  promptly on  June 10,  2013.  At first I had some difficulty with Act II ,title 1/8, chapter 24/37, the DVD froze  there and did not play further, however, after cleaning the DVD, it plays  beautifully now. I did not give it a five star because I had to clean it up.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved this book, but not as much as his previous two, &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;.  Hosseni has a wonderful way of writing and character development that makes you fall in love with the characters.  I was barely a quarter of the way into the book when the tears began to fall.  It's a wonderfully written, gut wrenching story that takes an emotional toll so be ready with a comedy to chase it with.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I had no idea what to expect with this book. I heard James on a podcast recently, that led me to his blog, then to another video presentation he did. So I decided to read the book.<br /><br />I could not put it down, and read it faster than I normally read any book. Inspiration, validation, and hope were all realized after reading this book.<br /><br />If you are in a rut, have a career you do not like, or looking for some entertaining inspiration, this book is for you!<br /><br />Thank you James!
B006O5XYWG|3.0|Just watched the trailer and now don't feel the need to watch the movie.  The trailer pretty much summarized the movie.  I miss trailers of the past that left something to the imagination.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The game starts with the rules and then each puzzle got a little more difficult.  Great fun.  Easy to learn.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Surprisingly great. Ozzys voice sounds like it was recorded 20 years ago. That being said the music rocks out also. I'm really impressed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|There are a lot of weather apps out there that give you the basics but this one goes beyond.  As someone who has a severe lung disease, I can't begin to tell you how much it helps when I can pull up the effects the weather has on respiratory health.  There are other things, like whether it's a good day to work outdoors, etc.  Many times I've been able to make arrangements to work around bad respiratory days.  Thanks AccuWeather.  8)
B002NXSRVG|5.0|O my god love the movie all the character played a wonderful role.I love the outfits,yes I will recommend this movie to my family.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun ten levels and not too hard. A little thought and consideration is enough to get you through. A relaxing timewaster.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I wanted a pack to haul gear without dropping a lot of money, and this is it.  It easily accommodates my DSLR, three lenses and filters, and has room to spare.  Dividers in compartments lock and unlock with velcro strips to handle longer and shorter lenses.  Good deal.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have just re-read the first two books to make sure I got the full affect of the third. I did read a lot of the reviews so I saw I was getting myself into. Although I really liked the first two I definitely agree this one was quite boring. Day seemed to drag it on quite a bit. Many long pointless chapter. And although I love the dominant and never tiring Gideon, it was getting quite repetitive and fake. The few exciting moments that Day started to create were solved so quickly, so there wasn't much suspense and wonder.<br /><br />Clearly there will be at least 2 more books. Not sure I will be reading those. I think this one was a waste of time and money.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|This app provides great background noise. Huge selection of sounds. Easy to use.  Perfect white noise for working or sleeping.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is a fantastic movie ..It captured the essence of the Characters personalities in the original TV series ..Sometimes  would forget this wasn't those guys..They sound and act like them that much. The plot even reminded me of the ones in the old tv series..combined with the special effects and you have a winner..I advise you see it in 3D for it is visually stunning. 5 stars
B008XKT9FG|4.0|Artistic story development which many of todays movies lack. The many valences of Ms. Helen Hunt so often go unrecognized, we are fortunate she is choosey concerning the parts she takes on, we are able to experience all of what she has to offer as a seasoned actress. Worth your time.
B00BNWWUDY|4.0|The movie is good..Not 5 stars good. I suppose people have been wanting a new movie with a twist..I starts off slow and depressing ..and depression is all over this plot. Hell that woman was depressing me. I would give it a solid 4 stars but it is no 5.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I did not realize my hair loss and scalp inflammation had anything to do with my digestive problems and the end results. Wheat is out of my diet and my scalp is experiencing major relief within 5 days. I just hope this change allows it to regrow. However, I must say my digestive tract seems to be responding well. This spells relief!
B009DH2PP4|4.0|Good information for an amature brewer to learn the hobby and for an experienced brewer to tweak his knowledge.  I have been brewing for 10 plus years and have been just basically &#34;following a recipe&#34;.  After reading this book, I know the interactions between the various components involved in brewing.  It will take a second and possibly a third review to completely wrap my mind around certain processes, but the book is not overly complicated if you take your time reading it.
B0019NG7HW|5.0|This is a classic masterpiece. It's delicous can hear a vynil of this classic group.<br />I recommend this buy. Great.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I bought the album 2 weeks ago, and it's now loaded on my iTunes.  The album is on regular rotation in my car and my iPhone when running. The album is excellent.  My favorites are \\"Cold Day In Hell\\", \\"It's Not Enough\\", \\"Flower Song\\", and \\"The Way Life Goes\\".  It's all rock with a blues song and a Country one thrown in. It's actually a 14 track album so you get your money's worth and a nice variety. This could easily be the next Cinderella record. I wish it was actually.  Hopefully, if he tours with Cinderella they throw at least 2 of the songs I mentioned above into the set list. Buy it!
B00B04NJI0|5.0|OK lets just say this, this movie has some amazing seqments and some not so.. but that is what makes the movie in a whole great!
0785814531|4.0|I've enjoyed Poe for years.  THis really showed me some of his writing I was unaware of.  Everything he did wasn't spooky.  Still my favorite writer!
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|The colors and movie were great!  I have the movie in Blue Ray, but when I got the offer to get this 3D version with 4 Disc set for under $20, I could not pass it up.  The 3D is very good and just makes the movie even better.  Not too much out of the screen, but too much can be a little hard to watch at times.  I did enjoy the 3D and the movie was very cute.  Kids and adults will like this one.  Good family movie, and another 3D for my collection.  I do like the choices to watch in regular Blue Ray or DVD.  I am getting ready to add the digital copy to my streaming.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game, very addictive, couldn't put it down. Wish it went on for longer. Great graphics and story.<br /><br />Glad of the hints, will keep on device and play again.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I wanted to see this one when it came out in Theater.  The Theater close to me did not release it in 3D, so I just waited to watch it on my home Theater.  Loved the movie and a good classic book remake into a movie.  I won't give away unexpected  elements, but the story was great!  Effects were good in 3D and glad I waited to see this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My husband and I have enjoyed playing this game.  Logical challenges and lots of fun.  We eagerly await the next group of levels.
B00B769XB8|5.0|I enjoyed the different take on Hansel and Gretel.  The story was good and everyone enjoyed this movie at Movie Night.  Good 3D effects also. A very good Action twist on the fairy tail, but then most fairy tails are action adventures.  Glad I bought this movie for my 3D collection.
B000O599ZS|5.0|John Wayne is always great! An American thru and thru and an American icon. Sorry I couldn't think of any more words.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, and I think that Jack, Nicholas Hoult (who also played in &#34;Warm Bodies&#34;) was a good choice for the story.  The effects were great.  Again, one the whole family can enjoy.  The Giants have a little grouse humor, as human eating creatures do.  The story was great and I will send this one to my grandson in DVD also. Family movie night was a success with this one also. I  pre release ordered this movie, so got a good price through Amazon.  Also through Prime, it was here on release date.
0553801473|5.0|Wow! Best book of the five he wrote.... just after the third one which is unbeatable. It is very good, i'll probably read it a second time.
B001F5M9MG|5.0|GREATEST ALBUM EVER Compiled by ZZ Tops!!!! The BEST, A MUST Have for Your ZZ Top Collection!<br />F. Shafford Dallas, Tx.
125000098X|2.0|Jeffrey Archer should have quit with the first book in this trilogy -- it was good -- the 2nd and 3rd were not.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game and can't wait for more levels!! Challenging but not so hard that you want to give up
030758836X|4.0|GONE GIRL is a compulsive page-turner. I picked it up every chance I got until the book was finished, which is rare for me. Ms. Flynn is an expert at language. I'm a sucker for a well-turned phrase and there are many to relish here. I was also intrigued by the twist that occurs at the center of the book and couldn't wait to find out the explanation for it. So far, 5 stars.<br /><br />But there were also elements that made me go, \\"C'mon, really?\\" too many times. The ending for one. Impossible for me to swallow. I'm a stickler for detail in a mystery and there were too many loose ends for me to accept. It was easy to find details that the protagonist and/or author should have thought of, details that would have been sure to emerge in real life.<br /><br />Then again, Henry VIII did get that sixth wife to say yes even though she had to know what the chances of that marriage had of success -- and hey, she did survive -- so Ms. Flynn might be onto something here.<br /><br />In summary, it's hard for me to award fewer than 4 stars to a book that kept me so riveted. But it really did remind me of many movies I've seen that, halfway through, I'm totally entranced, and by the end of the show, I'm simply angry at the writers. (My favorite example in that regard is Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby.)<br /><br />I'm still tempted to try one of Ms. Flynn's other books for its artistry, but not until its reviews convince me it's more realistic than Gone Girl.
0312641893|5.0|This product was shipped in a timely manner. It was also recieved in great condition.<br /><br />Cinder is an excellent story. It is another take on the Cinderella, that we have grown up to know.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|More in-depth understanding of the characters than from the classic black and white movie. Also good to have as audiobook
B000W967UQ|5.0|A friend suggested I begin here. I have fallen in love. I shall immediately begin the next one! A very simple read yet far more entertaining than I imagined. I giggled out loud the whole way through!
B0094KTCMO|5.0|I haven't seen a movie of this caliber in a very long time. This is an awesome movie for the family.
B00C7JG0KG|2.0|My two stars is towards Disney, i give 5 stars for the movie.<br /><br />Reading the package here on Amazon, i wanted the 3D blu-ray version. For some strange reason i thought it would include two disks, one for the 3D feature and one for the Normal version.<br /><br />Instead i got one 3D blu-ray disk and the digital rights to download it to my computer to watch it in other than a 3D format on only one device.<br /><br />Disney home video has struck again. If you want me to ever give you five stars on here, in eligible letters specify it is only one disk and join ultra violet like the rest of the studios.<br /><br />As for the movie i think it had stunning special effects and well cast. The 3D was by far the best way to see it. It is a great beginning to an old favorite, The wizard of Oz.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|We loved this movie.  I laughed and cried.  My daughter really enjoyed it also.  It was a little more violent than I would have thought for a kid's movie, but I did not realize it was a PG, good thing too or we might have missed it.  The only thing I didn't like was it made me a little dizzy sometimes and when the rocks came down it was scary.  I would recommend for 8+.  If you like Ice Age, you will probably like this too.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|As a space junkie, this was a pretty cool documentary.  I was impressed with how they made Hubble's pictures more 3D.  The rocket launch was awesome.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  I have loved it for years and was thrilled to recently introduce my children to it. Highly recommended!
B000U6BT40|5.0|I think I've seen most of the episodes, but I can say for sure, that I have never seen the first one. Love this show. Like Scifi, real world issues a d quirkiness then you'll like this show.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like the speilberg alien abduction themed shows. Taken was one of the best. this one is pretty good too. more action in Falling Skies. But its still pretty good. Characters are great. Just a great series.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I THINK  THEY SHOULD HAVE A WORD LOOK- UP  THAT YOU CAN WRITE THE WORD IN THE BLANK AND  THEN IT WILL BRING IT TO YOU. IF YOU NEED A DICTIONARY ON AN ELECTRONIC, LIKE AN ANDROID,  DON'T GET A NEW OXFORD DICTIONARY.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app itself is subject to Facebook's excessive updating of its own site, however having Amazon's version of the app, which is patheticly outdated, is just a waste of time. I strongly recommend using Google Play's version if possible
1582701709|5.0|I am japanese.<br />I purchased for studying  english.<br />I think it is good for studying english very well.<br />If there is Japanese translation, I am still good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was very enjoyable.  It had suspense, surprises and twists.  I didn't expect that ending.  I would definitely recommend it.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|This game is totally addicting. It is for the moment my favorite game. I like the Halloween themed mini-game right now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is very challenging but not rip your hair out impossible. It's addicting so I hope they keep adding new levels!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really hope they make a new one soon I played this twice already! It's a great game with very clever puzzles that make you think.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 11-year-old loves this app. She loves engineering and this app makes figuring things out so much fun for her.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Appeared to be a great game, however it did not download properly on to my Kindle Fire. I had to uninstall it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can finally read my book where I left off if I have to wait somewhere and didn't bring my Kindle along. This app is genius!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Not enough of a cliff hanger for the next books but definitely a good read. There was a lot of \\"love\\" and not a lot of story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very entertaining puzzles are great love the way it challenges your mind hurry up and add more rooms cant wait to keep playing
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|A farfetched premise, to some, but still conceivable, given the known history of man, and the political circumstances of our day!  Excellent casting of Jennifer Lawrence - she is very believable in the lead role!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I've played for hours.  It's a great game.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it tends to lock if get onto a feeding frenzy.
B0095P29EG|5.0|But I looooove this movie.  I love Natalie Portman, I loved everybody in it and I really love Chris Hemsworth.  It's fun, it's not meant to change the world or cure cancer but I could watch it over and over.  Actually I have.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A wonderful book. I could not put it down. The characters were amazing. Starting the next book now. Can't wait.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|She has the voice of an Angel and I think it is great she is only putting out one CD a year around the holidays.
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|Very good album... stuck to the vibes of the last album. nice flow over a good variation of beats. Really like the fact that he load up on features instead showed he has his own talent.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|It's a fun game and all but it took over and hour and a half to download...... ugh I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting
B00BYISQTO|5.0|... You will not be disappointed .  TWFM seems to be more inward and melancholy than past works. I was slow to respond to it first 2 listens, but now it is varied and textured. An emotional trip only the National can do.
B008MM9630|4.0|Really cool game but I hate the fact u have to use energy.  I always run out. I would play all day if I could.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I thought it had really good graphics. when I started playing I couldn't stop until I finished the whole game.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Being hearing how great this album is and I'll admit I was super sceptical.  Finally my love for sabbath outweighed my logic and I broke down and got this CD last night.  Man I'm glad I did.  I haven't been so happy with a CD in years.  Every track is good and its amazing how it just sounds like classic sabbath.  Everyone that likes metal or sabbath(Ozzy) whatever, needs to own this classic gem.  Rick Ruben caught lightning in a bottle here, just pure awesomeness from the gods of metal
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is very cool and useful. I swear it actually picked up a Dr. Scholls commercial that was on tv. It can pick up more than just music.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Cole done \\"drop the album the same day as Kanye\\"?....THANK GOD! No disrespect Mr. West, but make room for JYeezus. This album won't let Naz down...but Yeezus might! J Cole, one of the great ones!
B0007RO57U|1.0|Too much noise during the recording. I can hear it clearly even when I was driving. Although the piano is great, it sounds like being recorded in a large room with echos.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Cole done \\"drop the album the same day as Kanye\\"?....THANK GOD! No disrespect Mr. West, but make room for JYeezus. This album won't let Naz down...but Yeezus might! J Cole, one of the great ones! Ye fell off.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|No matter what genre of film you prefer, Planet Earth is guaranteed to be enjoyed. The camerawork captures nature in all of it's beauty, and this achievement is something it's creators should be proud of.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I honestly waited for this book hoping that the writer would keep me inspired and rooting for Gideon and Eva. What a real let down. Must it have so much sex in it?? I understand the \\"  I'm aol in love mode but really!!l I gathered that Eva is a bright woman and Gideon is an intellect and a power entrepreneur. So why not discuss the commonality and not so commonality yet every time these two get together they humping. What a waste of a good storyline I wish she hadn't try to play fifty shades catch up. Not looking forward for the upcoming series and I plan to remove this from my kindle.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's a awesome  game I love it. I usually am very picky about games,but I like this one I could play this one all day i love it!
B000YGIIPO|5.0|A fun and amusing book, full of fascinating characters and witty banter. Reminded me slightly of the Rats of NIMH series.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I rate this game two thumbs up. The only problem is that the server crashes too often. Otherwise, great game.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|World War Z was a surprising story. I didn't expect the construction of the stories to be built the way it was but in the end it was worth it. The use of varying anecdotes to tie the book together and real life places and organizations made this book a thrill ride.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love this game.  It starts off very slowly if you do not pay but eventually you earn a high enough level that you can go a long time without running out of energy.  It IS fun.  You CAN advance without paying...however there are some quests you cannot complete without money as you get older.  'LL IN ALL, GREAT GAME THUGH
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Omg I loooooove this game<br />its way better than the first temple run<br />I think its in china? the players look better 2
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie that makes you feel good after watching it.  Very well written and acted.  Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro both deserved Oscars for their performances.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game is addictive. I love it. My daughter gave it a try on my kindle and now she is going to get it too. If you like Mahjong you will love this one.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|I love rereading this book. It just makes me happy to do so. Don't hesitate to try this one. You will love it
B004JN1CW4|2.0|After two books in which nothing was ever particularly well explained, I guess it's not a surprise that the Maze Runner trilogy ends with nothing ever being particularly well explained.<br /><br />It is a disappointment, though. I enjoyed the first two books -- book one in particular -- despite feeling they had some flaws, and I was holding onto faint hope that The Death Cure would actually provide something more than the vague, senseless \\"answers\\" given so far. It didn't; it just reiterated them, like saying the same thing for the hundred-and-fifth time was going to suddenly make it make sense.<br /><br />It didn't really have any of what I liked about the first two books, either. If it wasn't going to explain all the wonderfully disturbing weirdness of the earlier books anyway, it could at least have kept that weirdness up, but no. Instead we got Generic Post-Apocalyptic World (Diseased Zombie People Edition), complete with requisite Dubiously Trustworthy Rebellion against Evil Government. It was all very routine, and I couldn't shake the feeling that everyone was just going through the motions. \\"Oh, we're in a zombie-infested hellhole now. Quick, remind everyone how morally gray our lives are.\\"<br /><br />Also, I was really disappointed by how Dashner dealt with Teresa. It felt like he couldn't figure out what to do with her, or how to explain and resolve the choices she'd made, and so he just brushed her aside.<br /><br />I will say that I thought he did pretty well with Newt's piece of the story, though. I don't want to go into spoilers, but one of my major complaints with the series has been that I never felt terribly connected to many of the characters, and that as a result, their stories tended to lack emotional impact. I think that in this book, Dashner made some steps in the right direction with Newt.<br /><br />That was one small part of the story, though, and wasn't enough to save the rest of it for me.<br /><br />I know The Kill Order is a prequel to the trilogy. I may look up spoilers for it to find out if I'm missing anything that miraculously makes sense of the whole business after all, but at this point I'm not feeling tempted to pick the book up myself.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I really don't write much about music, with the likes of Justin Bieber and the American Idol stars achieving superstardom, there is not much to write about.  Then last week, I heard a song called \\"Next Door Neighbor Blues\\" by Gary Clark Jr. and my faith in music and musicians was revived.  Here is my review of Clark's first cd.<br /><br />1.  Aint Messin' Around:  this song has the feel of a 1960's song, there is no better way I can explain it, staccato guitar, horns, a happy beat, a loud and discordant guitar solo.  I feel like some go-go girls should be dancing to this song on Top of the Pops or something. A very  audacious way to start an album.<br /><br />2. When the Train Pulls in:  A more traditional blues song, musically reminiscent like B.B. King, except with heavier guitars, the guitar solos remind me of Hendrix a lot. His voice in this song reminds me of Doug Pinnick of King's X.<br /><br />3.  Blak and Blu:  This song is more like the New Jack Swing style of the early 90's featuring artists like Maxwell.  If you don't remember who Maxwell is, think John Legend. A very smooth jazzy R&B song.<br /><br />4.  Bright Lights:  More Blues, heavy fuzzy, Hendrix type guitar work.  Very nice phrasing on the guitar solos.<br /><br />5.  Travis County:  For a change of pace, this song sounds like Bo Didley, or Chuck Berry, tells the story of a guy being arrested in a small presumably Southern County.  A fun song.<br /><br />6.  The Life:  This sounds more like a pop single, with a hip hop beat, and John Legend type vocals. Hardly any guitar in this song at all, another style in a surprisingly versatile album.<br /><br />7.Glitter Aint Gold (Jumping for Nothing):  A really heavy grungy start to this song.  It really reminds me of heavier songs by Lenny Kravitz.<br /><br />8. Numb:  The guitar riff in this song reminds me of \\"Come Together\\"  by the Beatles, the heavy distortion in the solo, and the willingness to go out of key reminds me of Hendrix, this song especially reminds me of Red House by Hendrix.<br /><br />9.  Please Come Home: Clark again jumps into the wayback machine and does his best Smokey Robinson falsetto, a style Prince has also appropriated.  Very interesting phrasing in the guitar solo.<br /><br />10. Things Are Changin' Another trip to the 90's,  A nice mellow  R&B feel.<br /><br />11.  Third Stone From the Sun: Clark finally pays tribute to Hendrix with Third Stone From the Sun, not as good as the original, but what is? Clark changes the song in ways I don't like, for example changing the tempo in the beginning of the song, unlike Hendrix who goes off on an extended solo, Clark changes the whole mood of the song and adds hip hop record scratching to it.<br /><br />12.  If You Love Me Like You Say:  A slow R&B jam, with plenty of guitars, interesting chord progression, reminds me of When Doves Cry by Prince, especially when he slips into his falsetto voice.<br /><br />13:  Next Door Neighbor Blues:  Going back to early blues guitarists like Robert Johnson, or John Lee Hooker, a really evocative song the way only a blues song can be, about love and loss.<br /><br />On the whole I love this album, it's not derivative to me, but I can tell where Clark's influences come from and they're pretty much all over the map, and that's a good thing. Grungy Rock, R&B, blues, pop, it's all here.  It doesn't hurt that I like all of his influences.  It's also obvious that Gary Clark Jr. has a lot of talent and is musically unafraid to take on any style.  I like that most of all. Songs that stand out are, Next Door Neighbor Blues, If You Love Me Like You Say, Glitter Aint Gold, and When The Train Pulls in, but there's something here for everyone.  Real guitar played by human hands, what a joyful noise it is.<br /><br />For more book, movie and music reviews, check out my blog, reviewswithatude@wordpress.com
0553062182|5.0|I am someone who is living with a friend who is a highly sensitive person and this book has helped me understand what she goes through and how to modify our living arrangement to accommodate her.  Great book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have the kindle fire and had no problems downloading and playing the app.  Good use of your imagination.  It's not so hard that you give up, yet not too easy either.
B00C81AVNU|3.0|If you are expecting to hear a versatile Broadway score, be warned that Cyndi Lauper's Broadway debut is not all that versatile, at least not as it sounds on CD. After a promising start (the first minute or so of the opening song sounds nothing like her '80s offerings), Lauper offers track after track that couldn't be confused with anyone else's work for a minute. While energetic and by no means horrible, her musical debut does contain a total dud of a song in \\"Charlie's Soliloquy\\", and her lyrics aren't exactly subtle or nuanced (does anybody want to take a stab at the lyrics of \\"Everybody Say Yeah\\"? Hint: it's in the song title). Other than a few songs delivered with bravado by the excellent Billy Porter, there's really not much to listen (and then re-listen) to here.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Have some ragdoll physics to make way fun and would maybe have it funny too sooooooo yea that's what I think
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love having this game because I have horses in real life.I also love  playing this game is that horses are cute but they are big.
B0091REZMW|4.0|ive only been playing a few minutes but I like it so far.  I don't think ive played a game exactly like this before.<br /><br />mijutes
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another great book by Sparks.  Can't wait to see the movie to see how it all play out a in the book.
B008G3N71W|1.0|This book takes place somewhere in England....about a girl with a stripper roommate, she meets a man on the subway, gets his number, she calls him after a semi-naked pep-talk from her roommate, goes to his house for spaghetti, the minute she comes in he slaps her in the face and then practically raped her, tells her she needs to lose weight and she's okay with it.?!?!  And that is as far as I got.....deleted it off my kindle fire, never will download again.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Can be quite addictive...has a few quirks but is overall a fun game.  Would be nice if gifting items was easier as some of the pieces are so rare together on your own.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am very annoyed with this book.. I loved the series till this point and I felt that this third book fell very short. There was absolutely no plot and I felt the book dragged on with no expected ending.. Things are left hanging and I felt that the author wrapped the book around Eva's scattered emotions. Everything is being drawn out and I won't be reading the next installment.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|After re sending another CD it had the same problem so they said they will take time to review it again and look at the problem<br />I am still waiting for a complete DVD that works<br /><br />today is August 31st and I found out that the bad CD played on another CD player just fine but not on the one we use so much. so we have stop communicating
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was an amazing book. I really enjoyed all the different characters and how it was told from different characters point of views. I read it in a week. I just couldn't put it down!
B009JBZH54|5.0|These are all so well written and totally entertaining to watch.  For me, some of the best action movies available.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|But the ending twist was disappointing but I will read the rest of the series just to see if how it ends that way or just to see how it ends
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun and involving.  Good for any language as there is no Reading. Just some math that's not that hard.
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|I had the original CD release, but the additional live tracks are 'Must Have' if you dig The Brubeck. Quartet in it's original form.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|Toy Story was already a great set of movies, and in 3D they are even better. The 3D just brings it to life and puts you even more in the story. This is great price at Amazon for all 3 Toy Story movies all in 3D.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Although I read widely, and have been impressed by other Pulitzer Prize winning fiction, this book puzzled me. Perhaps the fault was within me, but I found myself wondering why I was reading about this place and that person, and how did it all conform to the main character anyway? Keeping notes didn't really help either; they are meaningless unless they can be understood!<br />  If man's struggling is the point, I can say that as a reader I did! (And, yes, so did the main character.) Still, does reading about a protagonist mean we as readers must be subjected to confusion, lack of orientation as to time and place, and to other vast spaces of limbo revolving around characters, no matter the hero's struggle?<br />  It seems to me that smoothing out or explaining transitional periods of time and, place would have served a reader better in following this story. As it is, The Orphan Master's Son was not impressive in its creative bent---unless confusion is the purpose.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Excellent & fast paced .  The long awaited 3rd book in The Clifton Chronicles.  Cannot put it down .  Leaves you longing for more and the ending requires another book !
B008Y73XTQ|1.0|So, it's come to the point that I have to limit my Amazon Prime viewing to weekdays because they don't have sufficient servers or bandwidth to support HD for all of their viewers on the weekend. I can sometimes get HD to work, but often, sometime during the movie, the throughput falls and I get a message \\"Your network connection isn't fast enough for HD.\\"<br /><br />Now, you might suggest that it isn't Amazon's fault; I should complain about my Internet provider. But, when this happens, I go to speedtest.net and find out that my download speed is 50 megabits per second. And, when I switch over to watch a Netflix movie, the HD quality is fine.<br /><br />So, it must be Amazon.<br /><br />Now, regarding Das Boot -- Loved the movie. Gritty. Up close view of a high stress environment and how men cope with the risk of death, where there's next to nothing that they can do about it. Mesmerizing.
B003QTWR08|5.0|My 5 year old nephew loves it. Just the right amount of &#34;action&#34;, &#34;scariness&#34;, and humor. Fun times all around.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Completely addictive.My daughter and I loved  puzzle you  games an  playing to gather to crack the room code has become a favorite pasttime.<br />Some of the levels are much easier than others. You really have  to use you head. Keep your wits, think outside the box and have fun.
B0038AUY96|4.0|As always a great suspense filled thriller with a twist. Jo Nesbo doesn't disappoint and look forward to the next!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book had some valid points. While none of the information was new per se, it provided a healthy reminder for women in corporate America.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|There is not any plot, the author just wrote a life-narration in third person. It catches your attention the way it is written, the precision of the vocabulary and the poetry after the simply main character.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best free game I've found.  Would gladly pay for advanced levels!<br />Can't wait to share with other friends and family.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Films/adventures aren't made like this anymore. It's fun for all ages. I watched it growing up and my wife just watched for the first time. It's timeless, spirited, exciting, funny, and a wild ride.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addicting and challenging.  Things hidden in the strangest places.  Would like more of the turn the square puzzles. The variety of puzzles is nice.
0743487486|4.0|again, another book i have no time to read. if only you could absorb the material through your skin. i am sure it's a great book
1476734941|4.0|I am examining my diet and want take some weight off. This was after seeing Michael Mosley on PBS. The premise of the fast diet got me thinking and I checked it out with my doctor. She gave me a look that gave me second thoughts and then she explained that in my particular situation, it was not an appropriate choice.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|this is the original story just in updated color. my daughter loves this movie as much as i did as a child.
0316212261|4.0|Ms Carriger spins a great yarn. However I'm surprised and disappointed with the number of Americanisms that have crept into a supposedly upper class British tale. This is rather unexpected from one who comes from a family that includes a British expat. Surely your mother taught you that the proper past tense of sneak is assuredly NOT &#34;snuck&#34;: a disagreeably clumsy word that originated in the US in the mid 1800s, never was used by the English during that century and still isn't. The correct past tense of sneak is sneaked. You might want to mention it to your editors.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I would recomend this movie to everyone how liked movies like good old Top Secret or Comming to Amerika or maybe Borat.<br />If you are taking oppresion and terorism too seriously than thet one is not right for you,<br />Some very funny dialogs. I cought it in a right mude, so I had few good loughters.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|my daughter really loves this movie!! its a great on for the family to enjoy. even my hubby likes it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This a fun game that is not so challenging that you become so frustrated and want to put it down forever.
B00008OP0H|5.0|I am an enormous World War II fan. I've watched this over and over again. The acting is splendid. Plus, the action is awesome. This series provides an illustriously detailed account of the 101st airborne, which is fascinating.<br />After watching this, I bought the book that the series was based on.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|You can't beat the Harry Potter movies for weekend entertainment for the grandsons.  I can rely on this as a baby sitter for the next few years.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The acting is tremendous. This is the perfect account of that event. Every character is so dynamic.<br />On bluray, this movie is even better, if that's possible. So much high octane action. Every one must see this movie. I love it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|More accurate then the local news!  I absolutely love this weather app it gives you temp-dew point humidity and very accurate rain forecasts.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game, great graphics. Puzzles were fun but not too easy. The clues made sense as to where to go next. I will be playing it again for sure.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is very nice and it is no wonder why it has so many good reviews. I have been using it for about a month and it has not messed up once. The USB cable is braided so that it does not tangle easily, which is nice, and it has a long length. The light is customizable and it breathes on the anchor symbol. The scroll wheel has notches but does not make noise when scrolling. The buttons on the side are loose which makes the mouse feel a bit cheap but overall I think this mouse is amazing and useful for gamers.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Wow! This was a great book, and I loved  it. It was so fun and action-y! It was WAY WAY WAY WAAAAAYYY better than the movie!!----
B00CW665VI|5.0|HOT HOT HOT SEXYYYY! the content just makes you want to read more i cannot wait for the 2nd book to come out
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Greatest! Love ittt super fun and keeps me playing. Usually i don't like these kinds of games but it's so addicting!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this trilogy has definitely made me a big fan and i'm just sad that there are only 3 books i wish it was never ending!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|My Android TV box doesn't have GPS built in so I have nothing to worry about. but something like this on a game that is normally paid is a no no. He doesn't need to send us ads if we already paid for it. That's immoral and this developer should be banned from selling anything ever again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Loads quickly and doesn't time out like other games I play. I like how you can fuse troops together to make stronger troops.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Seems unlikely one would buy this unless they liked DSOTM...assuming this is true, this will make this incredible work come alive in a deeper and more insightful way. The band members reflect back on the process of working together during their most productive and cooperative period and play bits of the songs. Nice insight from Alan Parsons, who demonstrates some of the mixing choices. The &#34;extras&#34; are almost another whole movie, with uninterrupted takes of many of the songs. Great insight into the creative process, and especially fascinating if you agree that DSOTM is one of the best albums ever.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a good game but you just get into it and you run out of levels. There should be loads of rooms to investigate.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app as well with the FB app for your cell phones is so slow to open any comment tab or the like or share tab.  They need to make FB work just as fast as the original computer version.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Jeffrey Archer never disappoints me. All of his books tell a great story and hold the attention of the reader
0345803493|4.0|Have not read this one, but like the first two. Off to read &#34;2 now! You have to be kidding,<br />5 more words!
B00BUT5I84|5.0|my fav band! thanks for the fast service! love it! was nicely wrapped so it didn't break at all. thanks!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Nothing like his other books regrettably.  Did not have the intensity or the can't put down novel that the other 2 books had.
B00881VLCE|3.0|great pictures and fun.  works great on my kindle as long as I don't play on the rotate pieces.<br />on my kindle the pieces wont connect while on rotate mode. hope this gets fixed. I need the challenge.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|This was a really good read.  While you think you know what's going on, you might just be surprised!  Looking forward to reading more from this author.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I heard this album at work and had to have it!! each song is dance worthy and will get you in the mood for just about anything except a bad day.
B00161CO6K|5.0|Legendary blues fusion guitarist Beck has some mindblowing soulful licks in this, the soloing is superb. This album is clearly one of his best offerings.
B000VZYVOK|5.0|Magnificent collection of songs I missed 20 years ago from this group. This is the best seven dollars I have spent lately!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I should have read reviews first.  This is a spy app. No way they need to know my gps and phone use.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room kept me entertained and challenged every move. A must play game! This is the best game around. Can't wait for more. I love how the three dimensional portion comes in and out. All without having to read some boring story.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I consult TripAdvisor on hotels, restaurants and tours while planning the trip and I consult it again on my Kindle during our trip. No matter what site I'm booking on, even if it offers reviews, I compare reviews and double check  them on multiple sites. The reviews are the most reliable on TripAdvisor. My husband and I feel confident with the information to travel alone in so many different lands around the world.
B003FC6WBQ|5.0|I think this is a cute show that is truly entertaining.  Great performances by an impressive group of famous stars.  I've seden it several times, and enjoy it every time.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|Love this! Just enough of a challenge, combined with incredible graphics equals the BEST new game I have played in a very long time!!  So much fun, several chances allowed to complete the task makes it even better! Once you start playing, you won't want to stop ever! GET IT NOW, WORTH EVERY PENNY!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|What a great album; full of great hits straight from the heart.  Starts out strong with 2 big hits, Boys 'Round Here and Sure Be Cool If You Did.  Every song is either sweet, soothing or fun.  Big fan of Shelton.  Don't miss this one!
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I saw this exact same concert in Mpls and knew it would be good. Just wanted to share it with a niece who is having a family<br />crisis and would help assuage her problems. She called me and thanked me saying she absolutely loved it, has not<br />stopped playing it. Now she is an Il Divo fan just like me.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|Lizard benefits more than any other single release in the 40th Anniversary series. Clarity, detail, and separation are outstanding. The 24/96 mixes are a joy to behold. The first 4 Crimson albums have all been lovingly cared for and whichever ones are your favorites Lizards is now firmly in the camp with the other 3. I would say Poseidon is definitely the weakest with Islands and the debut coming in on top for me. This is as whimsical as Poseidon but carries a stronger sense of material and structure now that we can accurately hear the mix. It is a bit on the shortside but really all is solid. Lady, Lizard, and Indoor Games are standouts.<br /><br />This remix has opened up this album and you can really get the vibe that was going on in these sessions in pretty stunning clarity. The other mix done for this album was poor in comparison. Indoor Games is the hit on the record and a fascinating song it is. You can hear some of the disjointed stuff from other periods of Crimson in many songs here but it has a distinct and older sound, one that seems to be an amalgamation of the other three mentioned albums. The 5 songs on here go by pretty quick and there are a few extras but far fewer than the Islands or Starless and Bible Black sets which had a ton of stuff.<br /><br />This is more than worth it. Give it a chance. Another amazing album by this band from their golden period.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found this novel a wonderful read.  Held my attention with each chapter.  The characters were amazing.  Loved rooting for James, yet so enjoyed Rose and her long-winded, tangent driven stories!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Best flying shooter. Just needs to be created as a different game as Israel and Regular. Still totally awesome. Great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game, I had a good time playing it!! Great choose if you like hidden object games. I highly reccomend it!
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|A lot like the first Wall Street movie with a few more twists. Held my interest. Enjoyed the movie, good acting and storyline.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|While not usually a big fan of this genre, I downloaded the book anyway. Took me a while to start reading it. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! Excellent story, engaging characters, makes you really care about the outcome. I can't wait to read the next book.
B004AUNSX2|4.0|Well acted, good storyline. A bit slow at times but mostly held my interest. OK to rent but wouldn't buy.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show. Missed it on tv so watched on amazon prime. Now Im caught up. Cant wait for new season to start
0884271536|5.0|The author Eli Goldratt has written another great book applying his Theory of Constraints throughout the book accompanied with several vivid examples that help drive the message home. Another great book by Mr. Goldratt.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|My son got this for his birthday and he just loved the movie - he read the books first and he just enjoys it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|It was worth the 2.99 it was so fun and I was sorry it ended.  I loved the fact that it had more cut scenes involved as well as look and find. it was also sad too..<br /> Well buy it well worth it!!!
B001UV4XIS|4.0|My son got this for his birthday and he just loved the movie - he read the books first and he just enjoys it.
B00009R86L|5.0|I frequently carry two heavy cameras around my neck and needed some to relieve the pressure and make my old body last a little longer.  The cameras are still heavy, but they're much less taxing.  Good product!
0007466064|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the first three books so this is difficult for me to have to say but this is an expansive, vapid, ponderous, tome. It's actually one of the most boring books I've ever read. I stayed with it expecting something to happen but was disappointed chapter after chapter. Martin took well develpped , interesting characters and turned them into parodies of their former selves. A midget who now can only speak in one liners and a dragon princess who's a love sick little girl chasing a swashbuckeler. And why is everything a mummer's farce? You'd think that a writer of Martin's caliber could think up some new turns of phrase. I seriously doubt I'll bother with the next book. Better just to reread the first three and imagine what the series could have been if Martin was still at the top of his game.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time! My two and four year olds loved it! Perfect for the whole family!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good, solid game. Haven't experienced any glitches since the game installed.<br />Each game is varied enough from the previous game to keep my interest. Thanks
B009S33I68|5.0|Having seen the movie several times I was interested in reading the book to see how they compared.  This book goes way beyond where the movie ends.  Being a combat veteran of Vietnam myself I can relate to what happened to the brave men portrayed here.  Must read for all that want to know what these brave men endured.
B000VMIILU|3.0|I enjoyed  it, outside of the fact it is defective. The music was beautiful. Maybe the end could have been more conclusive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Game plays great, smoothly, doesn't crash, it's great. I play on the kindle fire hd but when it is left alone, the screen dims and eventually turns off which is normal. However, it won't turn back on after that. At all. You are left to hold the power button so it will power down completely, then you can reboot the entire device and resume playing. You probably won't read this but a fix would be great considering I gave you my money for the pc version, the XBLA version and now this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but it needs more levels. Its not near long enough, you get roped in and hooked, then it's over
B001AZFO14|3.0|The idea for the plot of the movie all together is decent. A soldier finding his humanity by persevering through social situations in a community he did not have the emotional nor verbal tools to cope with. Kurt Russel plays brilliantly in his role considering the limited script and poor editing that must have went into this movie. My reasoning for this is because he doesn't out of the blue portray his soldier as suddenly becoming verbally fluent on his intents. But rather goes through the movie displaying his ideas and intentions in a physical or vocally base level, such as grunts and the like, or perhaps intense stares.<br /><br />The plot to this movie had much potential. But the overall product left much to be desired. Character development was sketchy, and could of been much better if they dedicated more time to add depth to the characters involved. But as I have said before. The plot jumps around and loses points for pretty much making the main antagonist in the film a laughable joke of a sod.<br /><br />For a more thorough rating, I give it a  7 / 10
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Saw this many years ago and really enjoyed it. I thought it flew under the radar and was mostly overlooked by critics and movie goers. Very creative and entertaining movie experience.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|There is a 'missing' episode.<br /><br />The Pilot episode for Fawlty Towers was made in Black and White.  A common practice 'in the day.'  However, that episode is 'Brilliant' also, and very hard to find !<br /><br />So, there are 13 of these 'Brilliant' jewels !<br /><br />Hope you can find the 13th episode...  It is more than worthy to be included in your library !  Luckily, I have it. All 13 episodes fit on one extended play VCR tape !  (The episodes were 25 min each, so on a six hour tape, 13 episodes just fit !)<br /><br />(You will find that 'Are You Being Served ?' also has a BW Pilot Episode. Look for it !)<br /><br />THIS IS A MUST BUY / HAVE FOR 'ENGLISH HUMOUR' FANS...  HELL, FOR ANYBODY, EVERYBODY...  BUY IT, GET THE POPCORN GOING AND GET READY FOR AN EVENING OF LAUGHTER !  YOU'LL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN....  (SMILES)<br /><br />Here's an addendum: If you've ever worked in the hospitality service industry, you will find that all of the episodes ring ABSOLUTELY TRUE !' From 'customers/guests' to 'staff. ' Outside workmen, Health Inspectors, Reviewers, everything 'rings' so true ! What can go wrong, DOES go wrong for poor embattled 'Basil.' You've got to buy/watch. (For Pure Restaurant madness, a must buy: \\"Chef!\\".) Enjoy.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|After seeing a preview for this documentary, I had to check it out. I had never heard of Sixto Rodriguez before (granted he was a bit before my time- I was born in the mid-60's), but I grew up listening to, and loving, his contemporaries' music. After hearing HIS music, I was shocked that he had slipped into oblivion so easily here in the U.S. It was wonderful to discover that he is still \\"alive and kicking\\" and still doing concerts in So. Africa. Something that is hinted at, but left to the viewers interpretation is what became of the multi-million $$ royalties, forwarded from the So. African distributors to his label in Hollywood. Mr. Big-name Hollywood Producer gets pretty defensive when asked about it in the film! As the documentary producer says, \\"Follow the money...\\"<br />Anyway, this is a fascinating look at the life, work, and poetry of an incredible artist. It's heartbreaking that his work was marginalized and overlooked in his own country, and we are the poorer for it.<br />I'm adding his albums to my collection: [[ASIN:B001BKVWYG Cold Fact]][[ASIN:B001TCHDPS Coming from Reality]]

B005LAIIN0|3.0|Dubbed the largest budget zombie flick of all time, there is much expectation surrounding \\"World War Z\\". Brad Pitt's production company bought the rights to it in 2007 and has been working toward bringing it to the screen ever since. First of all, calling it the largest budget zombie flick of all time isn't really saying that much since zombie flicks are pretty much the territory of low or no budget filmmakers to begin with. Then you throw in Brad Pitt and put it into the middle of the summer blockbuster season and expectations go through the roof.<br /><br />So, what should you expect? Well, sooner or later, the zombie genre is either going to infect the entire country or drown itself in over-saturation. There are 8 zombie movies slated to release in 2013 and there were 25 released in 2012; most of these are done by low or no budget filmmakers, but the number of zombie movies out there borders on the ridiculous. Lets also not forget the highly successful \\"Walking Dead\\" television show. \\"World War Z\\" is a step up in quality, but is it all it's cracked up to be?<br /><br />Well just because it is part of the summer blockbuster season doesn't mean that it is chalk-full of action and events. It is a drama in its purest form. Many of the most action packed or awe-inspiring moments are revealed in the trailer and many of these trailer moments spoil some of the best surprises. Fortunately for \\"WWZ\\" though, its best moments aren't those heavy CG moments that are revealed in the trailer, but a simple scene where three lightly armed people have to navigate a building that is half infected or the moments that Gerry Lang (Brad Pitt) reveals that his true motivation is his wife and daughters.<br /><br />Despite a couple of really coincidental moments that caused me to roll my eyes a bit (including a plane crash caused by Pitt's character and of course his seat is the only thing that survives the crash), \\"World War Z\\" is well written, fast-paced and well performed. To compare it to other zombie movies is like comparing Pepsi-Cola to a lemonade stand; both are good, but one has more money. To compare though, this zombie flick may focus less on the gore and blood than others and Brad Pitt is a tremendous actor that makes this zombie flick better just by his mere presence.<br /><br />There's a catch to enjoying \\"World War Z\\" though; maybe two of them. First, you have to love zombie movies because it isn't anything more than that. Secondly, you have to lower your expectations. The movie isn't going to dazzle you in any way shape or form. \\"WWZ\\" is a human-interest story with the addition of really intense fast moving bloodthirsty zombies.to other zombie movies is like comparing Pepsi-Cola to a lemonade stand; both are good, but one has more money.

B00992CF6W|5.0|You can do so much stuff.<br />It is ENDLESS .<br />The bad part is it is you can't do as much as you can on the computer edition.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I just wish Disney had made more strong female characters when I was young. The story was well done and the animation was great. The characters were so good. All age groups will like this.
B001F290E4|5.0|he is so cute.  how can a man with a cut up face be so cute !  Love this dvd. Although I think he is signing other people's songs.
B006L4MWVE|1.0|There are not too many movies that I can actually say I wasted my time watching. This, however, was definitely one of them. The special effects were cheesy and the action spotty. The plot was weak and nonsensical.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What a voice. Man. She is so powerful and I love her words. I listen to this dvd all the time and would love to go to England and see her perform. What a voice and personality.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Not as good as the previous ones but still a good watch. I still love the characters but the intensity of running from world catastrophe can only be strung out for so long. Still love the squirrel/rat character chasing that acorn.
B00B29J0I6|1.0|I'm still trying to figure out how this app got so many stars..honestly in my opinion it's not even worth one star....it's VERY confusing...boring...not worth downloading in my opinion.
B009MO5E10|5.0|Gordon-Levitt did an excellent job with his character. Lots of action and fast paced. Loved the movie from start to finish. Kept me riveted to the tv. My husband also enjoyed it too. He is a much tougher critic when it comes to action movies.
B00APACSJG|5.0|We're all getting older... As usual, this author addresses both timeless and contemporary topics with insight and wit. And a twist.
B009AMALGM|3.0|This series of movies has probably met its end. There was little new and most of the movie was rehashed. The story was on the lame side.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I have never yet been disappointed with Amazon. They have always fulfilled my requests and if I was not satisfied they took<br />care of it right away.  I loved watching the Tudors with my husband.  He also enjoyed it very much. Sincerely, Kathryn Pulsifer
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This was done in such a clever way. The acting was definitely superb. I also enjoyed the plot and story. The characters were well done also.
0316098329|3.0|Found the book to be depressing and an unreal situation.  Then, according to newspaper reports a similar event occurred.  Even more depressing to think this could happen in real life!  Well written and holds interest, just subject not appealing - too scary.  While I read kept thinking this could never happeh - - and then it did!
B005LAII62|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. I thought it was cute and entertaining. Should be a good movie for kids to enjoy.

B00936A0RU|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. Jessica Chastain did a great job. Shia Lebouf made me want to smack him. He played his part so well. I was delighted by the story also. Not for younger than 16.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This has to be the strangest show on TV.  What does it say about me to enjoy a show that glorifies murder.  Even if they are bad guys.  A part of me enjoys watching those who deserve what they get, get it.  But when I think about praying that the serial killer doesn't get caught, well something has gone really wrong.  That said, it is a fantastic show.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|This was a decent scary movie. I enjoyed it. It did have some good moments. Much better that &#34;Paranormal Activity 4&#34;.
B00AA0U05A|4.0|I had no idea emmy rossum could sing let alone sing like she does. She can be playful, sultry, funny and moody. Keeping alive old standards is comendable. Her voice is nothing short of outstanding. Actually there are no words to describe her voice other than to say I just love it.
B005FITIGO|5.0|I love Kevin Spacey and he did an excellent job in this role. I also enjoyed the work of Zachary Quinto.. He is definitely an excellent actor. The story opened my eyes as to what happened to the fall of the mortgage catastrophe. Makes me wonder why people keep insisting that the market and banks do not need regulating.

B008P9M614|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who loves Hugh Laurie he is witty and funny.  I think it opens your thinking of everyday doctors. The storylines are outstanding and keep you watching.
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|This movie has become a classic around our house. Everybody constantly quotes the lines.  \\"Llama face\\", \\"Cheese me no likey...\\", \\"somebody's throwing' stuff\\", are just a few in-jokes that people who have seen the movie will recognize.  My wife and I love it, my 14 year old likes it, my young kids love it, even my dad is a huge fan.<br /><br />This movie has sharp wit, good acting and great characters.  It doesn't stop there, the art style and color choice is also amazing. It's also a movie that absolutely knows what it is and what it is trying to be, and delivers a smart, hilarious comedy.  The only turnoff might be for those who vehemently dislike David Spade's style of humor.  He isn't the only funny character however and those that are lukewarm might be won over by this performance.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazingly, mind boggling game.  If you want a fun game that uses your mind, that keeps you interested than this is it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|No game needs to location or access to my phone calls. Internet access is okay for ads, high scores, etc. But these permissions give me the impression that they are tracking me. I wonder for what end????<br /><br />Unfortunately I can't tell you how the game works.

I was told I buy a lot of them I cant check everyone! really
B004NDJXOO|5.0|Nobody played the angst teen like Michael J. Fox back in the day and here with a fantasy film that the entire family can enjoy over and over you will see what brought him to Super Stardom and what makes his so darn likable  to this day (looking forward to his upcoming TV series).  Here Teen Wolf is born  and while it bears no resemblance to the MTV hit it scores big time with being an 80's family comedy that will endure.  Funny stuff.  Scott Howard (Fox) is in High School and playing basketball for a team that Jack Nicholson (not in film) wouldn't buy a season pass for believe me...that is until a little genetic disorder rears it's ugly head.  But enough...don't want to give it away because it's way too much fun to discover for yourself.  This is the High School Musical of the Eighties and believe me it's what High School was really like back then.  Kudos also to his Dad in the film (James Hampton) an 80's character staple on TV given a role he sinks his teeth into.  This is just plain fun...and where can you buy that at these days????
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very well done. A game for those who enjoy a good brain workout. The graphics are good, and what a twist for those who enjoy hidden objects that interact with each other in order to solve puzzles. I highly recommend this game for problem solvers.

B0001WTVUW|5.0|I remembered watching the original TV broadcast back in the early 80s, so this was a blast down memory lane. Kind of chilling to remember the very real danger of nuclear war that existed back then - it was hanging over our heads. Thoroughly enjoyed watching it again..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is great! it keeps your attention and is challenging. it makes you think.  be prepared to get addicted.
0545128285|3.0|I thought there would be more stories.  Still an interesting book for an old (66 years old) Harry Potter fan.
B0017HRCQU|4.0|I bought this awhile ago and it comes with everything the standard BR gift set would have and the addition of some screenshots on postercard. Nothing crazy but I guess it's kind of nice, the only reason I bought this was because it was the same price as the regular BR release at the time.
B007WULJ5G|1.0|This movie has been filmed for just shock value. Utter garbage... The director wasted his talents into transforming a stupid idea into Hollywood trash...
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Downloaded the game after kids kept bugging me because their dad had it on his phone. Easy and fun just don't like the flip &quot;killing&quot; _driver<br />each time.  I would like a rosier version where driver just has a set back!  All in all good game, no technical problems either.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Did people who like puzzles this is a fun game for you it gets your brain to think and its not to easy not to hard.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|It makes my kids to think before making a mistake. I really like it. Useful for my kids before going to preschool.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game, me and my cousin broke my fifth kindle fire fighting over who plays first<br />So thanks
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Buying from Amazon was as professionally handled and well done as their usual level of excellent and trustworthy business service.<br /><br />As for this series, I was not able to see the Firefly series it when it first came out on TV, but I sure wish I had and that it was given the opportunity for a longer run. The series does tend to have more mature themes, but they are well done. This series is not just entertaining to watch but it also considers such weighty issues as: the relationship between imperfection and freedom; social governance and the drawbacks that occur when human domains of activity are subsumed into power-imbalanced forms of government; ethics of experimentation on human subjects; the meaning of human relationships; and questions concerning God and the contemporary world. The episode on Ariel particularly led me to have a new appreciation for the biblical phrase [When you hurt/loved my people], &#34;You did it to me&#34;; as well as &#34;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&#34; [referring to Saul/Paul's persecution of the Jewish Christians]. There is also a cohesion among the cast members that you can just tell in every episode.

0345529057|5.0|Well I just got the books yesterday (almost 3 weeks earlier than estimated and that made me very very happy!!), I checked all 4 books to see if any pages were missing, because some people had been complaining in the past, and I found that nothing is missing. Now some others, I guess we people like to complain about everything, complain about the quality of the books. Personally I found them very nice, tasteful and in general very well presented. The pages are a little bit thin to be honest (if for someone this is a big deal) but they are read easily and with no problem. The whole package worths every cent and I concider it to have been one of the best purchases I have made so far.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I will say that seeing it for the first time , I really enjoyed the cute and loving that goes into this on screen relationship that mirrors any healthy and loving relationship that you can relate to . You will love to watch this movie with the one you love !
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I stuck it through the first book just kinda getting by the story line but this second book was amazing! It is soo much better. The characters are more real, there is real chemistry not just sex which is very romantic. I almost feel bad for not liking the first book that much.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Undeniably a great remembrance from a great film. My kids love it and havnt gotten the cd back since. The case is way cool and well worth it. Have fun.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|ok I really did not like the first book that much. I felt it was a copy of 50 shades and the characters just felt rushed. but wow did the characters finally get that chemistry going in these 2 and 3rd books! I could not stop reading. It was soo much better than the first book. I finally felt connected to Eva and Gideon. I am on the lookout for the 4th book. Can not wait. I think these are better than 50 shades now! Its really kinda the same but without the kinky stuff.

B006GHA9QQ|2.0|Not very good. I normally love musical, but not this on. Andrew Lloyd webber should not put his name on this show.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Instead of seeing a frame from my personal videos as an icon, I can now see the titles (much more helpful). Also, some of the music I had transferred to the Kindle came out as \\"Unknown Artist\\", but now I can see who they are.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I first read this book 12 years ago before I had children. Reading t again now was a totally different and far richer experience. I recommend it to anyone. Try to look beyond the political elements, the dated world order and see the story of people, children and the moral dilemmas they (especially one) faces.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Arguably, the best pedigree for a superhero/comic book film comes from having the involvement of either Joss Whedon (who gave us last summer's brilliant AVENGERS) or Christopher Nolan (who gave us the epic, extraordinary DARK KNIGHT trilogy). Marvel Studios will continue to benefit from the involvement of Whedon, but Warner Bros, and its DC Entertainment subsidiary, is continuing to benefit from the involvement of Nolan, whose more grounded and realistic take on Batman was sought out to bring DC's preeminent superhero, Superman, to big-budget film once again. Of the five theatrical releases that preceded this summer, it's still the first one, Richard Donner's 1978 SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE that was held for years as the gold standard of how to make a great superhero film. It was filled with solid performances, imagery that was breathtaking for the time, and really framed the character of Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman in a way that would come to define him for three decades. But now, it's time for a new take, and that comes via the mind of Nolan, his co-creator of the DARK KNIGHT trilogy David S. Goyer, and \\"visionary\\" director Zack Snyder to reboot the character of Kal-El and bring him down to Earth once again in the visceral yet heavy MAN OF STEEL.<br /><br />From its opening somber notes on Krypton, as Jor-El (a terrific Russell Crowe) continues to be the lone voice in the wilderness predicting the imminent implosion of the planet, and General Zod (a strong Michael Shannon) looks to protect Krypton's heritage that may or may not involve the destruction of some of Krypton's most influential houses (to tell the truth, I'm still a little fuzzy on that plot point), Jor-El risks everything to send his infant son to Earth, along with something called The Codex, which seems to mean everything to the planet's history and heritage. Once the rocket is launched, the audience is immediately whisked into the present, where we see the 33-year-old Clark Kent (a fine Henry Cavill with very big shoes to fill) working odd jobs and trying to find his way in the world. Strange twists of fate begin to weave together as Clark eventually comes face-to-face with Pulitzer Prize-Winning journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams, doing a lot of good work as per usual) as they both end up investigating a 20,000 year-old Kryptonian ship buried in the ice in the Great White North. As the present goes on, we get glimpses of Clark's life as a young man and of his adoptive parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner, doing some of his best work in years) and Martha Kent (a strong Diane Lane) back in Smallville. He strives for identity and purpose and his parents look to give that to him, but still he feels utterly alone. So when the presence of General Zod arrives on Earth, Kal starts to become even more torn between his Kryptonian and Human sides. As Zod reveals himself to be more of a monster, though, Kal-El uses his very super powers and fights his own kind to save Earth and along the way, he picks up the nickname \\"Superman\\".<br /><br />First, the good things about this film. By and large, the performances are very good, with the standouts being both the fathers of Kal/Clark, Crowe and Costner respectively. Lane, Shannon, and supporting players like Christopher Meloni, Harry Lennix, Laurence Fishburne and Richard Schiff are all strong in their roles. Adams is very solid, and I appreciated the efforts that Snyder and company take to give Lois more to do other than being the damsel-in-distress that her representation has so often shown in the films. Cavill seems kind of tailor-made to play the adult Kal/Clark; he has perfectly chiseled good looks and is built perfectly, but time will tell if they end up going in the direction of the more bumbling and cowardly Clark Kent persona, since we don't get around to that, but that leads us to another strong note: This reboot has enough surprises to keep you on your toes, particularly when it comes to the physicality of Jor-El (who frankly afterbeing played by Marlon Brando, just about anyone would be more physical), and especially the beginnings of the relationship between Lois and Clark. I won't spoil it here, but it plays out much differently than in any incarnation we've seen of this couple before. The special effects and also the art direction by Alex McDowell are extraordinary. Also this film gives us something we've never really seen in a Superman film, which brings us to a mix of great and not-so-great: it shows us Superman FIGHTING. Now, fans of the series and of the character have seen this to some extent before during SUPERMAN II, and also during SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE. Other than those fun but ultimately unsatisfying fights, we have seen Superman lift impossibly heavy things and fly so fast, he could reverse time... but in MAN OF STEEL, we see him let loose with all of his power in fights that plow combatants miles away or demolish towns.<br /><br />This is part of the problem as I stated earlier, because the final act of this film is a long orgiastic eruption of fighting, violence and rampant destruction which veers a little too far into the area of what people have termed \\"Disaster Porn\\". We see a pretty large portion of Smallville and especially Metropolis being reduced to complete rubble in a way that feels uncomfortably reminiscent of images from 9/11. To add even further injury, Kal doesn't really seem to care about all the people he's apparently trying to save, with maybe the exception of Lois. As he and his foes pound each other through skyscrapers and businesses (some of which are certain to have people in them), he doesn't show the concern that the long-established characterization of Superman has shown. He always puts the safety of people first unless he simply has no choice, and that is something that is really shown in the finale of the confrontation between Kal and Zod, and Kal makes a choice there that will likely upset a great many true Superman fans. Also, the film does seem a little too heavy at times for a Superman film, and many times, just seems tonally inconsistent. Goyer's script is smart more often than it's dumb, but this seems like a very average effort for his talents. Snyder thankfully does away with all of his slow-fast-slow combat sequences that he practiced VERY heavily in 300, WATCHMEN and SUCKER PUNCH, but this still doesn't make him the \\"visionary\\" director that he's hyped as. Some of the camera work also is a little jarring as it seems to switch from steady to shaky at any given moment.<br /><br />However, there are more good moments than bad in this film, which leads me to give this latest effort of bringing the mythology of Superman to the big screen again a positive review. I can only hope that better things lie ahead for the Man of Steel in the future on the big screen.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.being played by Marlon Brando, just about anyone would be more physical), and especially the beginnings of the relationship between Lois and Clark.

Other than those fun but ultimately unsatisfying fights, we have seen Superman lift impossibly heavy things and fly so fast, he could reverse time... but in MAN OF STEEL, we see him let loose with all of his power in fights that plow combatants miles away or demolish towns.<br /><br />This is part of the problem as I stated earlier, because the final act of this film is a long orgiastic eruption of fighting, violence and rampant destruction which veers a little too far into the area of what people have termed \\"Disaster Porn\\". We see a pretty large portion of Smallville and especially Metropolis being reduced to complete rubble in a way that feels uncomfortably reminiscent of images from 9/11. To add even further injury, Kal doesn't really seem to care about all the people he's apparently trying to save, with maybe the exception of Lois. As he and his foes pound each other through skyscrapers and businesses (some of which are certain to have people in them), he doesn't show the concern that the long-established characterization of Superman has shown. He always puts the safety of people first unless he simply has no choice, and that is something that is really shown in the finale of the confrontation between Kal and Zod, and Kal makes a choice there that will likely upset a great many true Superman fans. Also, the film does seem a little too heavy at times for a Superman film, and many times, just seems tonally inconsistent. Goyer's script is smart more often than it's dumb, but this seems like a very average effort for his talents. Snyder thankfully does away with all of his slow-fast-slow combat sequences that he practiced VERY heavily in 300, WATCHMEN and SUCKER PUNCH, but this still doesn't make him the \\"visionary\\" director that he's hyped as. Some of the camera work also is a little jarring as it seems to switch from steady to shaky at any given moment.<br /><br />However, there are more good moments than bad in this film, which leads me to give this latest effort of bringing the mythology of Superman to the big screen again a positive review. I can only hope that better things lie ahead for the Man of Steel in the future on the big screen.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|This is a GAME.  It is not an app to go places or find anything.  It is not looking to help improve my situation in any way other than killing time in an enjoyable manner.<br /><br />There is less than ZERO chance I will purchase or download a game that wants my location, ID and/or network information.<br /><br />Go back to the drawing board on this one.  Don't buy any games, even if they are free, if they have such questionable permissions.  We NEED to show developers we are serious.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I was able to satisfy myself and my daughter. she got the DVD and I kept the Blue Ray. Great
0142424277|5.0|Read this because of the musical. Like all Dahl stuff it was amusing, and great reading for children. Buy it for a child you know.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Kept me reading but somewhat wordy in describing some emotional situation. Very good ending. Presents a case for thought. Would recommend.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Some tracks obviously I liked more than others. 'Broken' is exceptional. and Bugg does have a very musical voice of his qon, not generated by the acoustic dabbling.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I really liked this game. You can play any time and lose your place. The graphics are really nice. Another great and fun game from Big Fish.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book. It is so good... once you read it twice. Other than that this book is the bomb.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed this game very much and looking forward to getting into the next levels. I only didn't like losing all I had gathered when I would have to stop for something.
B00B9HECRU|5.0|Josh Groban has a beautiful voice and his choice of songs is awesome! I heard him on the Today show and had to buy his cd! His rich tenor voice will move you.
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|As the other commenters have indicated, it's a great game but there is no need for it to know ones location. If the developers removethe location permission then would redownload and play this game.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|She is a lovely singer and so nice to listen to soft,rocking and interesting styles. Her music in this album is quite unique.Love it!
B003UYUP58|4.0|As well as being informative this book is also interesting to read.  It does a good job of explaining the technical aspects of the research and the difficulty of finding the root causes of cancer.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Game could be fun, but what is the purpose oftracking my location? This permission is both unnecessary and an insult.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its an escape game (obviously). A few levels are pretty difficult but not impossible. I'm just rating this so the message won't pop up again!
B000FBJHZS|4.0|If you loved The DaVinci Code and Inferno this earlier novel by Dan Brown will not disappoint. Full of action, twists, the unexpected and a very clever ending.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|I watched the movie. The cast of actors are perfect and make the movie entertaining. A definite movie rental without kids in the room. Too much violence for kids.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is amazing the only thing that slows you down is when you dont have enough money to by food but the horse needs it to train.
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|This movie is just like the video game and has many of the scenes you will see in the game. My son loved it and is requesting we buy the movie.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I've started this book 4 times now--and stopped reading it 4 times because its boring.  Rowling introduces so many characters that its hard to keep them straight--and none of them--so far--have been compelling.  In fairness to the author, this review should wait until I've finished the book.  Maybe things will improve.  The thing is, I don't know if I will ever finish it.  There are so many more entertaining books out there--including a re-reading of the Harry Potter series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow all I can say is excellent book! Can't wait to read the third one! Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I just love this show. The chemistry between the characters is perfect. I'm not a tv watcher, but this one has me watching and waiting for the next episode.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I loved the book and was reluctant to watch the movie for fear it would ruin the story. When I read the credits and saw that some of my favorite stars were in the movie it changed my mind. What a good story brought to life by the actors.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My grandson's prevailed on me to add this entertainment to my Kindle Fire so that they could enjoy it.  I consented (of course) and they just love to play with the character and whatever it does.<br /><br />Recommend this for your enjoyment, especially with the kids.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|This was my favorite app until they made a change that requires you to be in the internet in order to use the app
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Really enjoyed this overall, but I did run into a few plot snags. Does it ruin the story, no, but I'm a stickler for details that shouldn't have passed a junior editor. However, the humor, touching reunion, action and suspense greatly outweighs it. I mean a whole chapter dedicated to sex is worth it. I can't wait to start the next book.
B005LAII80|5.0|Judge dredd has been around for 36 years ! now. And the first movie with sly stalone was ok, at best. But this one really just nails the character. Judge Dredd has no real backstory and never takes off his hood and that is maintained here. People who have not read the comics will probably think this is just  a action flick. And in that department it makes use of the 3d aspect in the most violent and expert way possible. Many 3d flicks just have the 3d for depth. Which is fine. But this is the type of 3d flick with many specific shots of things flying out at you. So it's a great showcase for 3d viewing in that vein. This is not about making a great character based movie though. It's about doing a Judge Dredd story and many are like thia one in the comics. But then again many are far more fantastic and I would love to see a more mutant orientated one etc. Where he goes into the mutated badlands and fights monsters etc. But this is a straight forward JD tale. In some levels it's like 'shoot em up' or Crank' in that it's a pure action flick. But they don't have a long history like this movie does. I like all kinds of action flicks , or drama flicks with a little action. It's a big field. this is a great pure action type of flick. If you don't like that type of flick then don't get this. Another great thing is that there is no ghosting in the 3d here. Many 3d films I have on blu ray have double images because they did a half butt job of mastering it to blu ray.  Not this one. ONe of the worst is 'shock labrynth\\" and sadly 'dial m for murder' which deserved a better mastering job. This is on the other end of the scale . NO 3d breakup at all.  IF you don't like mindless action flicks you may not like this one though.  I love em and deep storied ones with little action too. So it's all good for me.  This just looks stunning though , for that reason you should grab it alone.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great game.... review presented by GReview...<br />Graphics-  4.8 stars<br />Gameplay- 4.5 stars<br />Design- 4.7 stars<br />Shop- 2 star before... after update, 4.7 stars<br />Overall- 4.6 stars rounded to 5 stars.....
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it is a bit graphic in physical violence though for younger viewers.  It gets to the heart of how to really beat the bad guys at their own game.  I am no big fan of Sean Penn anyway, but he did a good job of playing a gangster... as if it were really second nature for him.  This movie is well worth the time to watch!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|why even put apps like this up for FAOTDs? it is disrespectful to loyal customers, but I see it over and over again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a very fun game not too difficult but challenging enough fun to play for hours and difficult to walk away from
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun I really enjoy playing this game. its a real brain challenger. I reccomend it very much. fun fun
B005VPRET4|5.0|These are great toys!  The girls have so much fun playing with them and using their imaginations.  Also a great creativity toy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazing game. Keeps you thinking. I wish there would have been more but then I would never get anything done.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Even if you are not a baseball fan, this is a classic film that is inspiring for all ages 10 to 100.<br /><br />As one of my favorite movies, I bought it again as a Blue Ray.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film so much I visited the movie site in eastern Iowa. LOVED IT!
B001KP2J3U|5.0|This is probably my favorite of all the Agatha Christie films, and it has taken a long time to get it.  It has been well worth the wait, so it will reside among several other of my favorite dramas of all time, such as Laura, Witness for the Prosecution, and so on.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|What a disappointment. Graphically this game looks pretty impressive, but the other side of the coin is the excessive application permissions. This game reminds me of Chinese checkers. With that being said, there are plenty of board games here that do not require a need to have access to GPS locations, information about networks that the gamer uses, course location etc. Without the explanation for the necessity to each of these permissions for game play being addressed, I will have to pass for now.
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|All of you who give one star reviews because they want your location big deal. Ever hear of games that you play against other people from other countries. And you losers can't appreciate that. If you have antivirus or antimalware software and they are doing something wrong it would be taken care of. Your life is not that important that they have to spend all day to see where the hell you are going. Get over yourself and review the game for its game play and not your paranoid tracking.
B008J34466|5.0|I love this CD! Of course it's Pink so it can't be anything but great. I highly recommend if you don't have it and like her, BUY IT!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I read the trilogy because I wanted something easy to get used to my new ereader.  I enjoyed the story.  The third of the trilogy seemed never ending.
B008MM9630|4.0|I just started playing it but I really like farming games and the quests are cute. I can't give it 5 stars when I haven't played more than 5 minutes.
0062255657|3.0|I really, really wanted to like The Ocean at the End of the the Lane. I really did. I read Stardust, also a fairytale, and didn't like it much either.  I can't fault the writing - it's wonderful.  If you're looking for a read like Stardust, you'll be happy with this one.  But I think I can't forgive either for not being the same caliber as Neverwhere, American Gods and Anansi Boys. Please try again soon, Mr. Gaiman.
B005VMSATA|5.0|Such a great movie!!  I mean, who couldn't love watching Ryan Reynolds in a movie anyways?  Great balance of humor to action.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I understand that everyone has its opinions about each book but make the reviews about the books subjects it self not what how much it keep costing you.  Out of all the 3 books so far for this series I think this one is the best, a lot happens and a lot of the issues does get resolves.  This for me is what I call a series yes at first I was made due to the release date being push back and so on, but am I going to punish my review on the book due to that NO.  In this book Sylvia Day took her time and actually gave us a story that was NOT pushed and forward too fast for my taste.  She took her time and gave us a story and actually gave us the mysteries of some characters.  I understand a lot of people compare this series with the \\"fifty shade of gray\\" for me is just another series with a story behind it and characters we love.  I don't compare it due to I hate comparing it due to its \\"its own series nothing less nothing more\\".  I also almost didn't buy it due to the bad review but then I read some of the reviews and it was about the price and release date NOT ABOUT THE STORY.  So read it well and then answer yourself if it was worth reading it for me it was a HELL YES!!!!!!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this show! I can not wait  for the new season...great actors/actresses adn interesting.what else can I say? good grief
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle Fire. It works great! It lets me know everything to do with my battery, from last charge time to what is using the most power to how long battery will last doing different things. It is very accurate, too. +/- 3 min. on everything I tried. Well worth it.
1878424319|5.0|This is a great book and in perfect condition.  It exceeded my expectations.  I couldn't be a happier customer.  Thanks so much!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really neat game...I must have been stuck on the tenth floor forever before I finally escaped. Very addictive and fun!!!!
B004132HZS|5.0|The huge and avid fandom is more than warranted! This is a cerebral but action-filled, quirky and charming modern new version of Sherlock. Riveting! Fantastic casting, can't say enough.
0525478817|5.0|I can now officially say I know what all the fuss is about.  This book really was THAT GOOD.  When I go into reading a book with such high expectations I fear the worst will occur.  Happily I can say that did not happen with this one at all.  I loved it just as much as I was hoping I would.  No harm done with the excessive rave reviews... they were fully warranted.  :)<br /><br />Hazel has cancer.  She almost died a couple times, and can't seem to figure out why she's still alive, walking this earth, when the cancer should have taken over by now.  She needs breathing assistance on a regular basis, but the medication she's on seems to be keeping her tumors at bay, giving her more time.  She may be terminal, but she's still alive.<br /><br />Hazel reluctantly attends her first support group meeting.  There she meets several wonderful and entertaining characters, including Augustus Waters.  He's silly, fun, witty, sensitive, and is also suffering from cancer.  His is in remission, but he knows how she's feeling and seems to be the only one that's able to connect with Hazel and really get through to her.  As a result of this new relationship with Augustus, Hazel begins to \\"live her life\\".<br /><br />Choosing the audio route for a popular book is sometimes not a good thing.  A bad narrator can really ruin even an amazing book.  But I have not a single complaint about Kate Rudd.  She performed this novel beautifully, from the joy and hope Hazel was feeling one minute, to the devastation and hopelessness she was overwhelmed with the next.<br /><br />Sad?  Yes.  You have to go into this story knowing that it's sad.  If you're looking for a sweet, happy upbeat story, this probably isn't the book you want to read at that moment.  This story involves the wonderful story of romance, love and learning to live life to the fullest.  Yes, all inspirational things, and the story really is that.  But it's centered around teenagers with cancer.  Sad.  This story is so realistic, so harsh and touching, I was completely enthralled right from the beginning.<br /><br />Seeing as how so many people have already read and gushed about this story excessively, I have a feeling I'm not the sole member of the \\"I love TFioS\\" fan club.  This is a powerful story that almost anyone will enjoy.  If you haven't read this book (Are there really people that haven't read this yet?  I thought I was the last one!) I suggest you do.  I challenge you to not be touched and inspired by this beautiful story.rsh and touching, I was completely enthralled right from the beginning.<br /><br />Seeing as how so many people have already read and gushed about this story excessively, I have a feeling I'm not the sole member of the \\"I love TFioS\\" fan club.

1592401791|5.0|Geoff's kind of dry but humorous delivery keeps you interested, and, of course, it's about the Beatles!  If you have any technical interest in recording or a desire to have a behind the scenes view of the stuffy English recording industry being shaken up by the arrival of both the Beatles and Mr. Emerick you'll enjoy this book...
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is really fun and addicting. But not to complain, but the dynamics are more for people who know how to drive &amp; it's not fair to kids. Plus not enough Gore. But  I'm not complaining.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Yeezus is by far the most creative album that has come out from Kanye's arsenal. so glad he didnt give us another sub par average hip hop album. kanye explored different beats went more for a darker undustrial kinda feel thats both agressive and shockingly artistic at the same time. I have such a skitsophernic taste in music, i love music for its power of changing someones life, not for the flavor of the week ganres and whats cool now a days and i can honestly say that this is the first kanye album that i listened to non stop for days back to back! I have his older albums but yeezus was that good i cant get enough. but for sure you have to go in to this album with an open mind and appreaciate the uniqueness of it. 5 stars! solid album.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|It covered so many wonderful aspects of life and love.<br />It challenged my thinking.<br />It made me laugh and cry.<br />It made me remember.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|its a mix between old world and new world meaning extinct animals u get to inrtact with and then u have the now a day animals that we get to c only at other zoos
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great game that does not require internet to play. I love doing puzzles and this game offers a great variety of free puzzle packs to choose from. Love it.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I was terribly afraid I would not like this book. The &#34;Bones&#34; tv show is one of my favorites. It didn't spoil my appreciation this novel. This is the first Kathy Reichs book I have read. I really enjoyed it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is awesome but it would be cooler if it had a little more graphics. But other than that it's great awesome amazing. Thank you to the people who made it
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|so my friend told me to get this app so I asked her if I could platitude a boom it was asome it was so co it had the best graphics ever get this app now plus it has a good price
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was by far one of the best books I have ever read, it's a book that will differently make you feel good and have you believe that magic does exist.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha still has a beautiful voice.  I feel it is a first-class album with great new songs.  Having the Stockholm orchestra included was a real plus.  She was a very important part of ABBA being able to sell 375-380 million records and a band second in worldwide sales only to the Beatles.
0812550706|4.0|Enders game involves children being trained for inter galactic war. Unbelievable? Not in this book. The main character, Ender, is as real as can be.
0061122416|5.0|Excellent book, it was an inspiring read. It tells to follow our heart, our head, believe in the world around us and everything shall come together to make our wildest dream come true. I strongly believe in following once heart, because you will never be unhappy if you do.
159463176X|5.0|this is the third  book by Khaled Hosseini I have read, and I can't wait till he writes an other. The story involves a really disfunctional family , and wends its way from Afghanistan , to Paris to the states. The characters are fascinating,a and  the places they live come to life as well.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is the very best CD I have ever watched.  Unbelievable.  It is just a perfect way to spend a night.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I am a big fan of Manhunter, the 1986 Michael Mann movie about Lector and Will Graham. As a result, I expected to be severely disappointed in this tv show. But far from it, this show captures the emotional intensity, confusion and relationship that worked so well in the movie. They even crib lines, as homage, from that movie, which feels appropriate.<br /><br />This show has about as deep an examination of psychology and psychological methods as I've ever seen in a tv show or film. If you found the conversations between Tony Soprano and his psychiatrist interesting, imagine if it were the psychiatrist who was the psychopathic criminal, manipulating his patient and slowly driving him towards insanity.<br /><br />In that sense, this is a true horror movie (or serial movie). It's also horrifically and graphically violent and bloody, so be warned - that's not really my cup of tea, but the script and acting are so good, and the psychological and emotional dimensions so compelling, that I'm willing to watch it even though I don't like bloody movies.<br /><br />I can't recommend this to people who don't like gore, but it's not a slasher or a thriller - the plotting is slow and they don't often hit you with surprises - and never ones that pop out of closets. So it's a classic horror show, not a new fangled cut-em-up thriller.
1577314808|5.0|Echart is a true spiritual teacher.  This book teaches you there is no past, there is no future, only right NOW.  This is so true.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed the book although while reading it I was afraid of how it would end.  It was depressing to read the accounts of abuse Jamie endured. However the ending was unexpected and heartwarming.
0452289963|5.0|This book is the complete organizing of all the spiritual awareness searching I have completed over the past several years.
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|...because it is the FAOTD, but I will neither install nor play until I'm given a reasonable explanation for why it needs any location permissions.<br /><br />But since I highly doubt such can be given, I'll settle for those permissions being removed.<br /><br />I will, however, based on what others have said, allow the benefit of the doubt and award 3 stars.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was not what I expected but was a good book on to book 2  now hope it's another good book
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I enjoyed Of Mice & Men but it had a sudden ending that took me by surprise. It's a great classic.
1616550414|5.0|This book is basically a photo book with little notes and tidbits about the franchises evolution through the years.  It includes the official timeline as well as concept art but the amount of content is very impressive.  Basically, if you love Zelda... you're going to want to have this book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was a little stiff not a lot of clues as to how things are done but its not all that hard to figure out. This game is a very great game.
0321344758|5.0|If you are into very advanced web design, it may oversimplify.  But, otherwise, it's brilliant.  What the author says resonates to me as a consumer and a designer.<br /><br />And, if you are dealing with advanced web design where oversimplification may be a factor, always take a step pack to see if you've make any mistake this book calls out.<br /><br />This is a book that gives the basic rules, plainly, directly, and coherently.  And, in my opinion, the author is completely correct.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|I thought the movie was pretty entertaining and it kept my interest.<br />The story was cute, and definitely different from other zombie movies.<br />It wasn't a scary zombie movie, but it moved well and was cohesive.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to people who want to be entertained without being scared or grossed out.
B0099KJFJ4|4.0|This movie kept me peeled to the screen there was always action going on i would recommend this to anyone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was forced to read this book for school, but enjoyed it immensely.  Zusak is very descriptive of setting, characters, and mood.  Being so young, it's hard to imagine how he paints life during the war so vividly without having experienced it.  Excellent read.
0062255657|5.0|The book is short and sweet- once I picked it up, it was just too hard to put down.  Easily read in one sitting.  Was not dissapointed
0767821629|3.0|Its OK.
039472903X|4.0|This is a classic marketing book that is very relevant for today and beyond. It is actually humorous to read all these years later due to the terminology and case studies on products from the era, but the thought process and wisdom is timeless.<br /><br />If you are marketing online or offline, you need this close at hand.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00005JL78|1.0|the worst documentary or whatever they want to call it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game has great graphics!  It was such a fun game to play!  I would be interested in the full game.
6305736650|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I have whatch it several times but did not own a copy.  I have a friend who has not seen it.  We'll see what she has for a taste.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was amazing. Couldn't put it down once I started. It keeps you guessing from beginning to end and the \\"gasp\\" moments are freaking intense. Great summer read!!
B0090XO57C|5.0|By now everyone has watched this series.  If not, men you are way behind the times.  I had to own a copy for my collection.
B008602KQI|3.0|Hold your horses, i know no, nay almost none, live up to the book, or  print, version. Yet I still had issues with the way the movie was delivered, the capitalites costumes, should have been much more flamboyant, the could have spent more time on training, and other various aspects. I understand that this is consideried a \\"Long Movie\\" by todays standers but what happened to the days of the two and a half hour (2.5hr) movies were of standred length, Sadly it seems that our attention span is down the drain. I like the film feel, though unshure is that was an effect added in post production or if it was actually  (though unlikely) filmed on film, the shoulder cam feel(boncing and bobing) gave you that wonderfull presctive as if you are right there, it drew you in and help you to connect to the characters. On characters they were not nearly as dynamic in the book. Though over all it is a pleasing flim to watch, though i do not plan on adding it to my dvd collection anytime soon.<br /><br />These are simply my opinions, i encourage you to form your own. They movie is worth a watch but i would not by it.<br /><br />Thanks for your time,<br /><br />Lou_Dawg

B00BWJARHO|5.0|I absolutely love the entire Hobbit and LOTR collection of books and the films are very close to the actual story. Highly recommended.
B002M7A79S|3.0|The TV-series was a bit more detailed, more exciting, and funnier. I read that the movie was supposed to be the conclusion to the series, yet its ending begs for a sequel. With lower expectations I would have enjoyed the movie more.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Not worth the time or money, this \\"book\\" is simply a list of interviews that does not tell a story or provide a satisfactory story line or plot.  Oral history my tukas.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This author always keeps you wondering how the book will end....what an imagination she has to put this novel together.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was so well written, I couldn't quit reading; Great plot, lots of twists, I never figured it out until the final chapters.  Great book
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|It's hard to sum up Boards of Canada - they are their own genre of intelligent ambience cum downtempo dance. What is clear is that they've defined a compass that many have followed at least since Music Has The Right To Children was released in 1998.<br /><br />I've listened to Tomorrow's Harvest all the way through - and some songs on repeat many times now since it came out. I was initially unsure, but then realised that this is BoC - their music is so multi-layered that to make a snap judgment does TH a great dis-service. To the detractors or those in doubt - listen to it again. And again. And again. In different places. At different times. Listening on a good stereo or headphones makes a difference. I'm not saying you will see the light on all of it. Some tracks are uncomfortable listening, but then, along with an occasional raw and intentionally unfinished sound, that's just part of BoC's style. TH will become a BoC classic.<br /><br />Standouts: Reach for the Dead, Cold Earth, Sick Times, New Seeds.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this game. Was a bit short tho. Wish there were more levels tho. But was nice game. Some challenge to it but not enough to frustrate you. If you are looking for a that super tough escape challenge - this is not it. Bug it is a fun game. Loved it.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Love the show, I like being able to watch it at any time I'd like. Would recommend it to anyone who watches the show.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I loved this app until the most recent update. Now there is a parsing problem for my device and I can no longer play it. I would have given it 5 stars before the upgrade.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|Extremely difficult install, probably what messed my cpu, DO NOT BUY. Use extra internal chassis fans instead, but if you are willing to try a challenge, this will be a great challenge.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I find myself compelled to finish this series for resolution (despite being disappointed time and again as the 'good guys' keep losing), although I also have to take breaks between books, as I sometimes feel as if I'm  slogging my way through a bog of violent images, intentionally disturbing sexual scenes, and repetitive description.  Book IV read too much like something that was intended to be turned into an HBO seires; at least this one reads more like a novel again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my 8 year old and I really enjoyed playing this together. we were pretty dissapointed there weren't. more rooms. cant wait to do more.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Though some of it is predictable, a lot if this season was NOT. I loved every minute, great writing and best season yet I think.
1609611543|4.0|This book provides insightful information about why so many people today appear to have difficulty with wheat in their diet. It is informative and well researched. It provides help in identifying hidden sources of wheat as well as ways to live wheat free if that is what you desire.
159463176X|2.0|He needs a good editor.  Characters okay, but clumsily written.  I could not get past the first chapter.  People I have spoken to who like the Kite Runner agreed that this book and the previous one were disappointing.
0440245915|4.0|In A Time to Kill, I found how complicated and dangerous the justice system can become.<br />In this book, the central character is Jake Brigance, the lawyer.  He has an opportunity to<br />serve as lawyer for Carl Lee Hailey,  a black man who has shot and killed the two young<br />men who raped, abused and injured his 10 year old daughter.<br /><br />The plot escalates when the NAACP  and the Klu Klux Klan enter the picture.  The black<br />preachers in the county begin gathering money, supposedly to help Carl Lee Hailey's family.<br />However, the money is designated for the NAACP to build a case for the courts and it stays<br />in the bank.<br /><br />The Klu Klux Klan warns potential jurors to vote for the rights of the whites.....with burning<br />crosses in their yards.  Death threats are everywhere.  The news media gather with cameras<br />and microphones..  The attack on the little girl becomes known in every corner of Mississippi.<br /><br />Legal battles are waged from all angles.  The District Attorney,  Percy Bullard, wants to control<br />the situation and prosecute Carl Lee Hailey.  Jake Brigance gets help from the the black sheriff,<br />Ozzie  and from Ellen Roark, a brilliant 3rd year law student. Many unexpected events show<br />the intricate decisions that have to be made in this battlefield.<br /><br />I recommend the book for its portrayal of personalities in this drama.....and for the way that<br />John Grisham shows how our legal system works under highly stressful and dangerous conditions.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I find.that I thoroughly enjoy this game.  I consider this game one of my favourites, and I am not a big. Gamer.
B00C0UHGLO|2.0|Because I own the physical game I was super excited to see this as the faotd. But once I looked at the permissions I was very disappointed. I will install after the permissions are cleared up. And update my review.
159463176X|5.0|I read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. They were both the best and when I saw And the Mountains Echoed would be released I placed it on my Wish List.  It is a book that is difficult to put down.  I have shared it with my daughter.  And she is loving it as much as I did.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Lee Child's book are a a great read, great characters, good plot, extremely well written, hard to put down once you start reading. This is only the 3rd of his, I am a late convert so I am reading them in order, all 3 are as good as the next, ca't wait to read all of them.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a big game with an interesting twist.  Its challenging and unpredictable.  You don't have to go back over the same places over and over.  Its well written.  Certainly worth the price of admission.  I'm so looking forward to the sequel.

B00C1LIYWM|5.0|I like all of the books by Nicholas Sparks. I have enjoyed all of the movies that have been made from his books.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|I agree with what one viewer said, &#34;British comedies remain an ilk of their own - smart, sassy, full of quips rendered so quickly that many are lost in the ether that propels the plot, and characters who often are such finely-honed parodies that they make us laugh at ourselves. HOT FUZZ is a fine example and it is a film brimming with a cast of some of England's finest talent who seem to be having as much fun as the viewing audience.&#34;
0743270754|5.0|It's long and satisfying, wholesome and inspiring. I just finished it and will probably re-read it immediately. I am immensely grateful to the author for a job so well done in making known to me the life and times of Lincoln. I am amazed at the poverty of my knowledge about this great man before reading this book. I am now of the opinion that the required history courses I've had in high school and college did me great injustice in allowing me to think such subjects to be boring. The true-story-telling of these events by this author was, to me, riveting.
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|seen this years ago, and have been fascinated by the alleged true events a must see an those stormy days
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good read for zombie fans- I wanted to read the story before I saw the movie and I'm anxious on what the screen adaptation will be like
B00756GKBA|2.0|Cool cover, with wacky pictures of Madonna throughout the booklet where each turn of the page reveals a letter of her name on one side with a picture facing it (self-centered much? Oh yeah... it's Madonna). I bought some sort of extended version that comes with a second disc of five bonus songs, but the whole thing still adds up to under 72 minutes anyway, so it really could have fit onto one disc. Oops! The CD is okay, but it's very electro - not a shred of guitar on this, so no Iggy Pop-isms when Madonna plays any of the tracks from this live, and no Monty. Well, no wonder - it's produced by William Orbit, who she worked with on Ray Of Light; sadly, there is also no song on this that is as cool as \\"Ray Of Light\\" or \\"Frozen\\", although \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" and \\"I Fxxxed Up\\" come close.<br /><br />\\"B-Day Song\\" is a boppy old beach song that doesn't really sound like a Madonna song at all, very 1960s, and something a bit out of the ordinary for Madonna, and for the feeling of this album (an incongruity of sorts, actually). \\"Best Friend\\" seems to be another \\"I miss Guy Ritchie\\" song, it is full of personal lyrics, some of them quite good \\"every man who walks through that door/ will be compared to you for ever more\\" and some of them quite bad \\"maybe I challenged you a little bit too much/ we could have had two drivers on the clutch\\". The CD tops it all off with a \\"party rock remix\\" of \\"Give Me ALl Your Luvin'\\" that is about 40 seconds longer than the original. It's got a funky party opener, it sounds like you're in some sleazy European disco well after midnight, not sure who you are, who you're dancing with, what's going on. It's good fun.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|My favorite episode is &#34;A Piece of the Action&#34;.  Kirk and Spock were great.  Can watch it over and over.  Classic TV every time.
B0002WZTOI|1.0|My son is really into airplanes, so I thought I should let him watch the ultimate plane movie... Tony Scott's Top Gun!! Full of awful acting, terrible singing, barfy music (I'm not talking about \\"Take My Breath Away\\", which remains untouchable), hokey characters, a bad script, weird cold war antics that never happened (did they?), the film is a B-movie from end to end that should have flopped at the box office. Somehow it didn't - it had the star power of Tom Cruise, the likability of Anthony Edwards, the who-cares-that-she's-a-hardware-geek beauty of Kelly McGillis, and a soundtrack full of anthems... before all that became cliche. The failure of Iron Eagle and other jet movies proved that either people only had the patience to watch Top Gun once, or there was tremendous loyalty to the Cruise-Scott formula (the fact that they didn't try a sequel also showed that they didn't dare push their luck). Great.<br /><br />The movie is hard to bear if you don't have the stomach for macho little boys like Cruise with a thing to prove getting pouty... do real people behave like this? Tom Skerritt is great, especially for those of us who remember him in M*A*S*H (although his \\"I knew your dad\\" speeches are grotesque - so much so that I believe Tarantino had these scenes in mind when he unleashed Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction), and so is Meg Ryan, appearing here for nearly the first time, when she is still scrawny, small-chested and plain looking, spouting awesome lines like \\"Goose, you big stud, take me to bed or lose me forever.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, there's a lot happening in the film, which is good, and Tony Scott is an awesome director (even if he's overshadowed by his brother Ridley). l loved The Hunger, and other Tony Scott films. Which is more than I can say about Tom Cruise...
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I like Tom Cruise and I am glad he signed on to do this movie about Jack Reacher the books are a great read.
B0014Z4ON4|2.0|A gory, silly and freaky weird movie (inflatable rafts go flying out of airplanes, etc). Nice opening sequence of poison, antidotes, torch singers (one - Kate Capshaw, who ends up marrying the director), annoying little kids, nutty Old Shanghai setting, corrupt Chinese businessmen, and all sorts of other nonsense. Oddly, the villains decide to doom Indiana Jones by ordering the crew of the airplane that is flying them to abandon ship midi-air (jump out over the Himalayas with parachutes) and allow the ship to smash pilotless into a mountain. What kind of a plan is that? Naturally, Dr Jones and his sidekicks survive by riding an inflatable raft from a mountaintop to the foothills of the Himilayas in no time, they then also get up and walk away from the incident. And it just gets more ridiculous from there. Great. Two good parts in the film - near the beginning when he thinks that he's escaped gangster businessman Lao Che in an airplane, when the door of the we see that the plane is owned by Lao Che Air Services (i.e. he hasn't escaped Lao Che's clutches, he only thinks he has) and Lao Che and companion's evil laughter; the other good part is Indy and Willie's smutty discourse where they momentarily forget that they're in the lion's den and want to have a good time with each other (Short Round can't watch, though, or he has to pay a hundred). Some nice dialogue: \\"Hey, Dr Jones, no time for love - we've got company.\\"<br /><br />Special features show Stephen Spielberg being interviewed that he wanted the second Indiana Jones movie to be the darkest of the trilogy, perhaps mirroring what was happening with the Star Wars trilogy (makes no sense, since the Indiana Jones stories don't bother with continuity!), but he was probably just after an excuse to justify lower sales since he knew there was no way the second film could be as good as the first. His screw-around movie, so it was not as commercial as parts one and three. The idea of the mine chase, with its gravity-defying stunts, had been slotted for Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it didn't come off. The camera catches George saying \\"I'm more of a humor guy than a dark guy.\\" Yes, George Lucas - the guy with the best sense of humor in all Hollywood. Harrison Ford talking about how there were 8,000-10,000 snakes on the set, thousands of which escaped each day. Among the \\"snakes\\" were lizards called glass snakes (they're lizards because they blink). We learn that the Tunisia scene from Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the same spot that R2-D2 was captured by the Jawas in Star Wars. Elsa Schneider resented Sean Connery in Raiders III, \\"he had my role\\" (why are people from the third movie popping up in the bonus materials of the second movie?). Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote the screenplay, notes that it's very rare to have a beautiful woman who can do comedy. Huh?ng stunts, had been slotted for Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it didn't come off.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for horse lovers. The graphics are nice, the horses are beautiful, and its really fun to play.
B000001FGG|5.0|I bought this cd back when it was new music in 1968.One of the few benefits of getting old (smile) is appreciating musical genius when you come across it. Music hits come and go, and happen all the time. But music that stands the 'test of time' is something that happens just once in a while. This album is one of those &#34;once in a while&#34; events.
1593976216|5.0|In my busy life, it can be hard to find time to sit-down and read. I enjoyed listening to this while commuting. Very nice dharma.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I can't get enough of this movie. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in my life! Director Tim Burton has certainly produced a top notch film with this effort. The one thing that surprised me is, on the dvd case it states that the movie came out in 1996! I'm just finding out about this movie this year. Where the hell have I've been???
B00B29J0I6|1.0|This app looks like a lot of fun, but I pressed download yesterday and it still isn't finished. Not impressed at all...
B002AT8KCY|4.0|Another fine performance by John Travolta. I bought this movie because of my budding interest in computer security. As someone who has been hit with drive-by malware attacks on more than one occasion, this movie has helped alert me to just how deep hackers can go in their efforts to undermine computer security. I have a lot to learn!

B00AHXIC50|5.0|This dude is just oozing with talent and the various styles he plays with on this album shows it. Every track is different and some of the topics reminds me of the old school cats talking about them young girls getting you in trouble and the pretty ones taking all your stuff. If you like his radio hits then you need to get this album
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I blindly 'got' the game and read the reviews while it downloaded. Oops, can't let that install... It's just not worth someone going through my shorts to play a game
B00D8WJ9JK|3.0|I've known about Cole for a while but this is the first album of his i've bought. Lyrically he is one of the best in the game. Each song he hits you with some real talk in a very smart way. The problem for the album is the production. Its not that every song has to be a club banger but they mostly have the same flow and tone from one song to the next. On the ocassions where he didn't produce a track you notice by how different it sounds. I hear his first album and mixtapes are better so i think i'll check them out. As far as this album goes its top notch lyrics with weak production
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game and very addicting.  I sit down to take a break and tell myself only gonna play 1 level next thing I know it's 2 hours later.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I've always liked what i've heard throughout the years as far as TDG songs go. Chalk Outline and High Road hooked me instantly when i heard them on the radio and thought this would be a good time to check out an album. I've heard they changed up the style for this one and it works for me. There is only one song i don't much care for (Time That Remains) so 12 out of 13 ain't so bad.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|I am a great fan of Le Carre - his latest dosn't disappoint in any way.  It is a 'must read'.
B00BS4PF0C|4.0|Blake has always had radio hits that i liked. I bought this one after liking Red River Blue and he has not disappointed. He has his style and he sticks to it. Got a little funk, really good ballads and at least one song that makes you laugh(Still Got A Finger). If you like what you hear on the radio then you will like what you hear on this album. And if you don't have it go pick up the last one as well
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The only way you can describe this book is with tears<br /><br />That is how amazing it is. I shall start reading the next book when I'm done writing this
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|After buying Own the Night based off the first two singles released from it i became an Antebellum fan. So when this album dropped i bought it immediately. I was so shocked that i only truly like about 3 songs on this album. Alot of it sounds like run of the mill filler that lesser artists would make to get radio play. Check out It Ain't Pretty, by far the best of the album.

B00C0UHGLO|1.0|This developer now joins my list of those who I will avoid.  (Yes, I actually have a list.)  This is due to their apparent belief that I will be so bedazzled by their creative genious that I would carelessly abandon my priceless right to privacy for their mere app.  Since my location is a condition of use, I won't use you.  Simple.  Heck, I wouldn't tolerate this even if these dev's paid ME!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I never tire of David Baldacci's books.  So when I spotted the paperback of The Innocent in an airport bookstore, I had to pick it up.  After all, I needed something to read on the plane when they make me shut off my Kindle. Anyway, it caught me right away, and I ended up downloading a digital copy when I got home--because, well, I like reading digitally. It held up from beginning to the end, great plot, intriguing characters, and solid writing.  Now I'm going to have to read the second one in the series.
1609611543|5.0|This was an amazing informational book. I have a medical background and thought I knew something about nutrition. Had started cutting out wheat somewhat before the book. Heard the author on a radio interview and it prompted me to buy the book. Have been wheat fee about one month, feel great (at 70 years old) lost 6 lbs., and do not have reflux anymore. My environmental allergies are 98% gone, not had to use an inhaler or nasal spray for weeks. I am walking and actually old-lady jogging about 1/4 mile every day.<br />Thank you, Dr. Davis, for all your research into this hidden little known topic. Get the word out.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|This brilliantly written history of the Belgian Congo should be required reading by all who like myself never guessed or even knew how it came to be the private fiefdom of King Leopold who amassed a fortune after enslaving and killing a huge population of native tribesmen while most of the so-called civilized world looked the other way.<br /><br />A most important book.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Movie was confusing in the beginning.and then didn't quite understand what was his condition and ways how he was acting.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Google has been my homepage on a PC since the first year it appeared. It's simply the best, however, on the Kindle Fire HD Google search lacks voice to text. In truth it's not a Google issue, but an Amazon Kindle issue. On a PC keyboard text entry to search is easy. On my tiny little android phone I tap the microphone icon, speak the search and it's converted rapidly and accurately to text. Nice! On the gorgeous, big screen Kindle Fire HD I'm reduced to a single finger slowly tapping in the query.  Not so nice.
0062202081|5.0|Justin bieber is amazing! He's so young and has so much a head of him! He's the biggest popstar on earth with #1 albums in almost every country! I hope he makes right decisions because god has put him in a very wonderful environment now. I hope he doesn't make bad desisions like a lot of teen stars do. He is a nice, great guy with a big heart! And this book really showed me that! Keep up the great work justin!!!!!
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I've used this for many years on a PC. I now have it on my android phone and the Kindle Fire tablet. All three sync and play together nicely and I'm never without passwords, lock combinations, filter sizes, account numbers and you name it. It's indispensable for me.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|The game isn't too bad, good way to kill time. Just after a while you seem to run outta things to do &amp; then it's hard to hold interest in the game.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  It has a fabulous cast with a great storyline.  It's one I'll watch again and again!  I highly recommend it!

B000OYC7A8|5.0|Gilmour and Wright are sooooo much in tune with each other, you can almost see their brainwaves crackling back and forth through the air between them like a Tesla coil. I'm not the first to say that Gilmour is the best guitar ever heard on this planet, and Wright does the same for the keyboard in his low-key kind of way (no pun intended). Darn it, Richard, you are sorely missed ... but you'll live forever, man. Rock on doing your great gig in the sky. Love ya.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It entertaining for all ages from three to thirty three! Really like different level opitions and easy in transitioning between game styles and levels!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|This story is not up to past standards.  As the Crow Flies is my favorite. Prisoner of Birth is also excellent. This story seemed to borrow some already-used plot lines. I was disappointed, but finished the read non the less.
B008UCDDQS|5.0|Bruce Lee was more than legendary and Enter the Dragon was the pinnacle of his career.  Since EtD was his first American production in which he could show his entire face (prior to this film, Chinese were forbidden to be in the media, hence the mask Bruce wears in the Green Hornet series) he put his heart and soul into this film. Some items of note: Bruce Lee coreographed all the fight scenes.  Hus unique style, Jeet Kune Do, is featured in the first 5 mins of the film. JKD would set the prescedent for MMA.  Watch for Jackie Chan getting his head cracked by Bruce's nunchuka in the prison escape scene.  Amazon pulls off the HD conversion brilliantly with no artifacting or buffering
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Unnecessary nudity, very slow moving plot (excruciatingly so), we felt like it was a complete waste of time. Don't recommend.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|Steam punk but not full on steam punk.  Good romantic elements and pacing.  There was a backstory but it was overly edited if you  know what I mean.  We got a glimpse of each characters history but it wasn't clear how or why the heroine was the half sister of Leo.  Did Vickers love Emily or not.  Still, good story.  If the hero and heroine are likable and have chemistry that makes up for a rushed plot.  I will buy the next one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Then this is a fun game to do it with. I  beat all levels in about an hour and a half.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Beautifully written, wonderfully conceived short stories you may not be familiar with.  A perfect accompaniment to your summer vacation.  Highly recommended!!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I've been waiting awhile for this app, and it is fantastic! But I do wish you could create your own levels and playgrounds like in the ds version. Other than that I have no complaints! Very fantastic and amazing game!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Makes you think, without being too hard or too easy. One that will keep you entertained. I had a real hard time putting it down. (Sorry dinner was late, Babe!) More rooms, please!!!
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I went with my mom and some friends to see this movie. we walked in after getting popcorn and drinks. we walked it and it was packed. we barely found a seat that we could sit together. there are some great actors and actresses in this movie. Some you will know from other movies and tv shows. I loved it. I was secpital because we wented the dark knight rises and it had high ratings and we didn't like it. so I was secpital about this movie but I am glad i went to see it. you will love it but it doesn't start out like the other super man movies and tv shows does. that is just a heads up.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|if you love free flow or free flow bridges, you are going to love this app! just as addictive as all the other games! it's. well worth the price!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Not okay for this game to track my location. Canceled installation until this permission request is removed. Loved this actual board game as a kid.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Alright movie more adult themes slow at points and most of funny stuff shown in commercials. Nothing else on tv worth watching once would not watch again
B0015DWJX2|3.0|Friends had rated this one higher than I did but after I got going it became more interesting.  It did have<br />some historical content.

0307460444|5.0|As I mentioned in my review for Martha's Cookies book, my review stays the same for her Cupcakes book.  Again, her recipes are fool proof and very easy.  Anyone can make these cupcakes and everything that I've made from this book has been delicious!  I bake a lot of cupcakes and I practically own every cupcake baking book out there.  By far, this is the best in terms of taste and clear instructions.  Definitely one of the best baking books out there!

They are fool proof, easy recipes that anyone can follow.  All of the items that I've made from this book, have been absolutely delicious!!<br /><br />This is my go to book for all things cookies.  It's simply the best!!  I love this book so much I'm even thinking about getting a second one just to keep an untouched unused version in my collection of books.  It's definitely one of the best baking books that I've ever purchased!
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|As the first mainstream American kung fu movie to be produced in about ten years, I promised myself to see it. I wasn't sure what to make of its first-time director, but by and large I was excited for it. However, I ended up not getting to see the picture until recently, and by then, some trepidation had built up for me, based on the lukewarm reviews I had come across. I'm glad for them, because this would have been a pretty big letdown otherwise. \\"The Man with the Iron Fists\\" is an entertaining action flick and certainly not bad, but stylistic choices by the filmmakers hinder what could have been a very good adventure and dilute it to mere little more than a visually interesting time-killer.<br /><br />The story: an assortment of warriors, assassins, and various deadly individuals - all in pursuit of treasure - descend on a small town overseen by a unique blacksmith (director and rap star Robert \\"RZA\\" Diggs)...<br /><br />Director and leading man RZA is a hardcore fan of traditional kung fu flicks, and producer-in-spirit Quentin Tarantino is big on retro repackages. They have fine ideologies, but I'm fairly certain that the movie could have been made without being so ridiculously hokey. The cheesy opening titles, the recycled Shaw Bros. sound effects, the cartoon gore, and a good deal of the dialogue are constant reminders that the filmmakers didn't take their product very seriously, and I'm a bit resentful for it. Not only does this seem to act as a waiver for any technical shortcomings (see the unrated version, mainly), but all of this had already been done better a decade ago with Tarantino's own [[ASIN:B007D5E7C2 Kill Bill]]. Guys, it's *okay* to fill a movie full of cool things; you don't have to account or apologize for it with comedy.<br /><br />And there certainly is a good deal of cool things to be found here. Artistically, the movie is a success, with great sets and unique costumes. Many of the special weapons I had never seen before. The storyline is juicy, and it moves at a swift comic book pace that I find appealing. And the casting is, for the most part, full of winners. Rick Yune ([[ASIN:B0035V35P8 Ninja Assassin]]) as a main hero, Lucy Liu as the deadly madam of a brothel, and ex-WWE star Dave Bautista as a monstrous enforcer - good. Byron Mann ([[ASIN:B001L2ZSJO Street Fighter]]) as the lead villain, Kwan Tai-Chen ([[ASIN:B00284G2BC The 5 Deadly Venoms]]) as his ill-fated father, and MMA champ Cung Le as the former's main henchman - very good. David Wu ([[ASIN:B00104AYGK Legend of the Black Scorpion]]) as a creepy assassin and the singular Gordon Liu as the teacher of RZA's character - fantastic. RZA himself gives a much better performance than expected. I have no idea what Kurt Russell is doing in this movie, but in the end, his performance as the horny gunslinger is endearing.<br /><br />Of course, the best action cast in the world is only as good as its action scenes, and disappointingly, I think these fights could have been better. They could have been a lot worse, of course, but considering the amount of talent involved and that they're wrangled by Corey Yuen - one of my favorite action coordinators - they definitely fall short of their potential. There isn't a single fight scene that I can point to as an example of a great cinematic brawl. Part of this is due to the style in which they're choreographed; I'm not a huge fan of wire-fu. Nevertheless, the wirework shows some ingenuity (e.g. the Gemini fight), and in the end, the biggest drawbacks of the brawls are that too few of them feature any amount of satisfying back & forth action and that too many of them feature an overabundance of slow motion and CGI enhancements. These are clearly supposed to be Hong Kong-styled fights, but come off more as Americanized Hong Kong knockoffs.<br /><br />With that said, there are several good (not great) fights, among them the showdown between RZA and Bautista's characters, which is better than it has any right to bein my opinion. I think that's the best way to approach this movie - with low expectations, so that you're pleasantly surprised at the highlights and not too disappointed by the shortcomings. For his junior outing as both an actor and a director, RZA does a good job, but I think he was held back by both the ambitiousness of this project and the influence of the folks who were supporting him (read: writer-producer Eli Roth). I'd be interested in watching the sequel that's set up during the credits, but that one will have a lot it needs to build on if it's going to be better than this.in my opinion.

B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Fire!!, Fire!!, Fire!! and.....did I say Fire?  Her greatest work to date.  Ten hot previous albums and those were just to warm up.  Now this girl is on fire. Certainly an award worthy work to even the most discriminate music enthusiasts.  Maysa, you've outdone yourself.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I hope HBO holds Mr Martin's feet to the fire. He seems to make a habit of leavingus hanging, then waiting 2 to 4 years before releasing another book to continue the story.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This is an excellent movie, one of my favorites, in fact, but why Amazon has it listed under documentaries is a complete mystery to me.<br />*This is NOT a documentary.* This is a dramatic interpretation of historical events, and utilizes all available dramatic devices for maximum dramatic impact. Liam Neeson is the perfect choice for the role of Schindler, a bon vivant who undergoes a change of heart and risks everything in order to save the people he intended to exploit. Ralph Fiennes delivers a frightening performance as the psychotic SS officer Amon Goeth. The casting and direction are near flawless. So much has been written about this spectacular film that I doubt I have anything new to add.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|...Like Clockwork delivers great music in a classic rock opera style. The songs weave in and out of each other. This album has become one of my favorites by QOTSA.

B000WMFZNS|5.0|Another Technicolor \\" Love story\\" movie of the late 50's that blows you away when placed in your Blue Ray player.  Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren, although in real life were not fond of each other, put on a good show of 11th century lovers in the turmoil of the Christian and Moor wars in Spain during this period.  This is an abbreviated history of the man, Ed Cid, that all will enjoy.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|Everyone should be required to watch this movie growing up. A true classic.<br /><br />Excellent War portrayal. Superb camera work... must have
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I enjoy this type of action in a game.  Graphics are designed extremely well and I like the fact you guide player with a stylus or with the gyro. I give the game 5 stars.
B003UESJJC|5.0|Most of this story is believable. I know from experience. Except for the ridiculous ending I watch this film with many thoughts, and not very often.  Good blue ray print and sound. I  C6

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is an amazing story.  I knew that North Korea's government was evil, but not how evil.<br /><br />Read it, and pass it on.
B002CSC5EC|5.0|I like the total coverage of this concert i.e. the people, cleanup, songs, the way people respond to whatever has happened to them along the way. Picture  for the blue ray is some what better as well as the sound. C6
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Simple enough. Wish there were more levels.  Advertising for free play tolerable.  My son and daughter (pre teen) enjoys as well as myself.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|Been waiting for this film to be properly restored. The blue ray is very good, and the sound comes across as more forceful. If you are familiar with this Patton story you know what to expect. Excellant. C6
B00C0UHGLO|2.0|I have to be able to get a chance to play the game before I write this post labels and I have been a long time and I have to be disappoint good riddance to the cable man he was mean so I bought this game and I like it for safety reasons that I cannot wait to tell you
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have used these for years in the gym and am saddened to hear they are discontinued. I bought these so I have an extra pair. The bud type headphones do not fit in my ear and always fall out (plus they hurt my ear). The over the ear headphones with buds never stay on. (I must have small earlobes). These fit perfectly and comfortably!! They've never fallen off, are not affected by sweat, and are not huge and clunky looking.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think it is fun but not too much I don't really think that just driving in any type of ride is not too fun
B006GHA9VQ|1.0|Sorry I did not like the story line nor the music. Tarnishes the character of the people and the music is not up to par of the original.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The operation of this type of game is almost flawless. I really like the game play very fun game. I plays just like on a computer just ps graphics which isn't bad for a kindle.
0783225733|5.0|Purchased to show students at the end of our &#34;space&#34; unit. Today's kids did not grow up with the Apollo or Gemini space programs always amazing the questions they ask. Keeps their attention.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the awesomeist horse game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. good for kids who want to have a horse one day awesome
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Definitely worth watching. Such a good show to see what life was like back in the early 1900's. Love it!!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I'd been waiting so long to hear this compilation of music with Jason Bonham for years. I was not disappointed with the music at all. The videotography on the blue ray disk leaves a lot to be desired, but the music sines on! I'd recomend this CD collection to any Zeppelin fan. They will not be disappointed!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|OR a fan of everything 70's - oh the clothes, the hair, the mustaches, cars, the bar in every home, wall to wall shag in every color of the rainbow, and all kinds of celebrities, some before they were famous, some past their prime, but most not immediately recognizable. It's great fun to watch. This was my boyfriend's favorite show as a kid, but I only thought to look for this set a couple days before his bday. Thank goodness for Amazon & my prime membership with free expedited shipping. I ordered on a Thursday and that Saturday as we were enjoying a late bday breakfast at home, the UPS guy arrived - perfect timing. My boyfriend said that this was the best birthday present he ever got. ever. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. Thank you Amazon, thanks Peter Falk, you too UPS.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but the sci-fi cowboy theme looked interesting.  Not a whole lot of story here, but overall I enjoyed this movie.
B008B1VYP0|3.0|Haven't listened to all of this one yet. What I listened to so far is okay, nothing has popped out or made a lasting impression on me yet. Will have to take some more time to check it out.
B001GF8WPI|4.0|Saw this movie first on TV.  I am not a Will Ferrell fan in the least little bit but I have to say I enjoyed this movie.  I thought the story was fairly original and it was well done.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game with lots to do without having to buy a real horse. If you love horses then this is a game for you.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good young adult novel that completes the trilogy, moves fast. I needed a break for my brain from studying physics, and this fit the bill nicely. Catniss is a great character for young girls who have a little tomboy in them, and I wish she'd been around when I was a pre-teen. But please for the love of God, Kindle, stop recommending YA novels just because I read this and let me get back to Haruki Murakami.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just as described, works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Would be 5 stars for Free version except that the ads are too frequent, I can live with ads for Free Apps, but not that much.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I can not get a single video to load and now there is a thing on my screen that won't go away!!!!!!
1608871827|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moD31CUECX5949]]SPOILERS APPEAR IN THE FLIP-THROUGH VIDEO BESIDE<br /><br />-<br /><br />Pacific Rim: Man, Machines, and Monsters is the art-and-making-of book for the film.<br /><br />It's a great book. Big, hardcover, 156-pages. There are additional sticked on materials on the pages, stickers and two big posters.<br /><br />The book is packed with amazing content. There are lots of concept art, set photography and lengthy writeup on the production. Everything's beautifully laid out.<br /><br />The concept art consist of the characters, Jaeger robots, Kaiju monsters and film scenes. The bulk of the art, more than half the book, is on the Jaegers and Kaijus. The development art are just awesome. They are very detailed. There are Jaegers with their front and back with closeups to their heads, battle damaged versions, 3D wireframes, 3D gray models and some discarded concepts.<br /><br />Kaijus are crustacean-lizards-insect inspired. The designs look great, menacing, and dangerous. The texture work is really well done. The sculpted maquettes look terrific. There are twelve Kaijus if I counted correctly. Guillermo Del Toro has his unique sense of art direction. It's clear he likes monsters very much. Kudos to Hugo Martin, Alex Jaeger, Francisco Ruiz Velasco and other artists on the designs also.<br /><br />The set designs are illustrated with mainly photographs and art. Again, they are very detailed and there's a strong sense of worn and tattered feel to most places.<br /><br />The commentary is excellent. There's plenty to read about the characters, the designs of the Jaegers and Kaijus, and many stories on the production process.<br /><br />This is a fantastic art and companion book to the movie. One of my 2013 favorites.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B0086700CM|5.0|keeps the kiddos entertained for hours , they have downloaded it on every electronic in my house from tablets to smartphones
B000GCFBQU|5.0|This is a wonderful novel about the relationship between a mother and daughter: the ambivalent feelings of love and hate; the pains and joys of growing up; the competiveness and jealousy between two women; under-<br />standing and misunderstanding; youth and age; truth and deception. It is also about learning to forgive as well as learning to let go. I've read three of Strout's novels now, and this one resonates the most with me--probably because I was once very much like Amy. As usual, Strout writes beautifully and in a style that makes one feel that the author is sitting in the living room with her reader and recounting a personal memory.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun app of finding clues to solve a puzzle.  Finding clues is sometimes hard.  Will keep you thinking.  Is not too frustrating.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this! Can't wait for more! Not too hard but a fun challenge for sure. I'd recommend this to a friend.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It keeps me very entertained when I need something to do. It is a very addicting game and you have to push yourself to earn prizes and characters.
B000HS28BY|3.0|I had no idea that the film was in Spanish or I would not have ordered it.<br />Sophia is magnificently beautiful in this turning point performance of her career.<br />She alone makes/saves this film.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think this is an awesome game and enjoy it very much. It is actually educational as well. I have learned a lot about fish as well. So over the past few days I've been non stop addicted to this game. I think it's an awesome game.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|The movie is one I've wanted to watch for years but simply never seemed to find the time. Recently, a friend suggested we watch the movie and lo and behold, it was fantastic. The movie is a reflection of the times as you will notice right away with the clothing, music, and cinematography. However it was not cheesy or a detractor of any sort.<br /><br />If you are fascinated by the subject of espionage and intelligence, aka, the CIA, as movie subject matter, you will no doubt enjoy this movie. Robert Redford's character is tenacious without being overbearing. His search for the truth makes him a target to be dealt with, and quickly, but by whom, or what?<br /><br />This review is ambiguous for a reason. Watch the movie and you will find yourself drawn into a world of code names and self-indulgent motive from start to finish.
B00CLZ48FA|1.0|Purchased this movie and it didn't work. Wouldn't let you download or watch. Waste of time and money. Stay away.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Why use gems to get main characters I am not going to waste my money on something like this and start the game off 1000 gems and the coins 10000 because how much the ponies cost is really expensive I mean $100 just for coins on a game unbelievable and I say 1000 gems because princess celestia is like 900 how is someone going get 3 or 4 gems all the way to 900 yes I know you can get gems from friend but I have tons online but it takes forever so please add a update this is for my little cousin she is a huge fan
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Great cast. Classic mob movie. Break out a bottle of Italian red and enjoy. Not as violent as more recent mob movies but a good solid show by the all star cast
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Chose the book based on the number of purchasers.  Great book and the crowd usually gets it right.  Good choice.

B005R32L66|3.0|I have used Facetime (Apple) on my iPad before using Skype.  In a nutshell....Facetime is far above and better software than Skype.  The way you launch (and maybe I'll get better at this) seems clunky vs. opening up FaceTime and clicking on my son's Profile to initiate a video session.  Then performance wise......sure FaceTime has has slow connection and lags....but I think it's more a factor of my DSL.  Whereas, with Skype I could not get the video to open.....even thought UI was telling me the video was launched.....and my only choice was to stop a video session that never was up and running.  Stopped the sessions and reestablished a connection with my son and encountered the same issue.  There seems to be a camp of pro Apple and anti Apple....but on this one I side with the pro Apple camp.  Facetime is better than Skype...hands down.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I love this book. Most of his concepts were actually common sense if you thought about it. I hate that this was never taught in school, big excited that Robert was willing to share this information that could help change a life like mine.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers like so much, it lets u have fun and earn coins by running multiple times. It lets you go to different places like Miami, Rio, Tokyo,  and many more places. Throughout the places you get the character that represents
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so much fun if you are looking for a hair salon game for your kids or for you this is the game your looking for when I first saw this game I said wow looks fun but when I saw the price I was like wow so I said let's see if it's really worth it and I was wrong it was worth the price !!!!!!!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app is basically an advertisement for YouTube Pro, at $1.99.  On my Kindle Fire HD, the videos play, but with two large ads, blocking about 40% of the screen.  Of course you want, YouTube, but keep looking.  This app is whack.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Smooth game. Fabulous music. Relaxation. This game is both calming and challenging. Above and beyond the 99&cent; price. Definitely recommend. Well done.
B0082A3JHQ|5.0|I went to both of the shows. At the time I thought out of the 15 or so times I saw Jimi that this was the best show ever, including Montery. When I saw the 1st bootlegs (2 record set version)I immediately snapped one up. I put it on the turntable & 1/2 way into the 1st song I thought \\"WTF???\\" . It sounded awful & it made me question whether I had just been caught up in the moment & that clouded my judgement. A friend of mine had this version & I listened. WOW!!! Upon hearing this my judgement so many years ago was vindicated. This was a truly monumental performance. Yes, there is tuning & that sort of stuff but the performance was astounding.  I bought both the vinyl & the CD (for my my car)  I do prefer the vinyl version & from the CD I made an edited version with everything but the music edited out for more casual listening times. If you were only to have one live Hendrix I would most strongly recommend this one. I only saw him one more time after this in Sacramento CA with the Buddy Miles Express. From the second he hit the stage people were screaming out for his hits. every time he tried to do something different people screamed louder for his hit. It obviously pissed him off & he basically played the part from the Woodstock soundtrack, not including the stuff from Woodstock 2 and walked off the stage after 35 or 40 minutes & didn't come back. I glad to have this memento to wash the taste of that show out of my mouth or ears as it may be.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I love fantasy and having run out of all my usual authors, came across Morgan Rice. Yes, there may be errors (at one point Godfrey became Gareth mid paragraph) but even so, I have found these books gripping and enjoyable. I bought book one three weeks ago and have just finished book six!<br />I can't wait for the next book!
B003Z9Q548|5.0|The only reason I bought this album was that when I saw their tour last year afterward they would only sign items bought then. I wanted a vinyl Turtles album anyway so I bought this & got it signed. When I got ithome Ifigured since it was already open I might as well play it even thoughI already had all their albums plus all their solo albums. Glad I did. The sound of the vinyl pressing literally jumped off my turntable. I can't recommend this album highly enough. If you see the 2013 Happy Together tour & this is available by all means BUY IT!!!!! Maybe get it signed?
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I am gleeful at the functionality this product delivers. No client side hackery required! I've been able to use it to connect to virtual machines, Ubuntu and Windows flavored.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|If you ever want to know what goes on in secret at high government levels, Shooter is the movie to see.  Marine corp. marksman, Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Walberg) is hand picked by secret opps. Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to take the blame for an assasination attempt on the president's life.  Swagger survives the frame up by leaping out of a window after being shot twice in the chest, steals an FBI car and eludes a massive capture attempt.  He is aided by his ex partner's widow Sara Fenn (Kate Mara) who tends his wounds, and a disgraced FBI agent, Nick Memphis( Michael Pena) whom he saves from \\"contractors\\" bent on killing him.<br /><br />Swagger wows revenge (they killed his dog) and fights back using all his special military training that has taught him how to survive in tough situations.  Along the way, Swagger seeks advice from a flavorful Tennessee rifle expert (Levon Helm) who tells him how Johnson is able to frame him.  Meanwhile, Agent Nick Memphis is aided by his agent friend on the inside (Rhona Mitra) who slips him sensitive information.  Johnson is backed by a crooked senator from Minn. who has been killing african villiagers to steal their land for its oil rights.<br /><br />This is an action packed film from start to finish with Walberg playing the best role of his career.  The supporting actors are excellent in their roles.  Danny Glover is positively errie.  I really enjoyed this film.  I recommend it to those who love action adventure flicks.

B000YAA68C|5.0|I had watched this on TV.....enjoyed the love story so much I decided to buy it.  If a person enjoys a story of two people so much in love that love can reach out to comfort the other......even from a far.  I have watched it several times.....each time I understand the feelings they have for each other......as I did for my husband.....my best friend, my most precious love....hope you enjoy that kind of love too.....feel it with this story.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|I was surprised to find this was not a complete game.  Kept getting notices to buy the complete version.  Disappointing!  Hidden agenda must be to get the free one only to find you have to buy a complete game.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Watch this movie, it actually will make you understand the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy! It is a masterpiece!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game to play when you are bored.  But it costs a lot of money to buy the ponies you need.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I liked the boy's story in this movie.  It kind of made me wonder at the end if it really happened or not.  It was worth watching once, but probably not worth owning.  I don't think I'd watch it again.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I saw this movie at the show and enjoyed it so much I purchased it for family and friends from out of town to watch at my home. And I'm sure I will watch it again and again and again.
B00BI745AA|4.0|I was pretty impressed with Hugh Jackman's singing abilities.  I knew Russel Crowe could sing, but had never heard him.  I'm not usually one to watch musicals, but this was a good one.  Good story line behind it.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THE CRACK BACK INTO THE MUSIC! THE MOLLY MUZIK MADE ME LOSE FAITH IN HIP HOP! 5/5 Stars, words can't begin to explain how incredible this Album is!
B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|This is a CD I'm sure I will listen to over and over again for years to come. Sumi Jo is so technically perfect and is a great complement to Cecilia Bartoli. Previous recordings of Norma by Joan Sutherland or other opera stars are great, but this recording is done in studio on period instruments and it definitely has a different sound that is enjoyable.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|This movie is well written, well acted and tastefully done. This movie adaption of the incredible book by Isaac Marion of the same name does a zombie lover good.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Why thank you for reading this! ANY way I love love love love love love this movie! I use to own it but would go every were with it so i could watch it at friends houses and stuff and i lost it! I REALLY want to watch! I have Prime and I do not know if its on disc on demand! I REALLY REALLY hope it is so please help! I know this is not really a review but still please? Help me! I hope this helped Just SAYING YOU NEED TO WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009MYARIK|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella' s books and her latest was not a disappointment. I thought this book was funny and very entertaining! A must read for Kinsella fans!
B000NY12CI|5.0|This story is one to be shared with young girls worldwide. I was fully immersed in a cultural history entirely devoid in History textbooks used throughout America's educational system.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Truth pemeated the production.  These great actors are flawless.  Dustin Hoffman as director braved leading great actors his senior in age and achievement.  Yet he reminded them to stop acting and just be, and they humbly, enthusiastically loved and accepted his direction.  The story shows us all to stop massaging our own egos and love as strongly as you can in every direction.  We are not separate, so why not start behaving in that way.<br />As entertainment it was enormously delightful.  As emotional experience it was profoundly moving.  I hope everyone gets what the movie is about.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have been having fun with this app. it is challenging enough to be really rewarding when I make it into the elevator! Cute puzzles - can't wait for more levels!
B009AMANBA|5.0|We just fell in love with the movie. What a wonderful true story about our Great president Lincoln  The sounds, the picture, the passion of making this movie had to been so hard to get it just right. Super!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love all the Harry Bosch novels by Michael Connelly. Hope, there are more Harry Bosch novels coming. So far I read them all.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars you're the best!  I love all your songs.  Wishing you the best and success in all your shows here and in Europe!
B004G600A4|4.0|Love this retelling of the classic story of Rapunzel. My only complaint is the DVD case seems to be extra flimsy plastic and even arrived broken.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it...it was perfect and easy to go from each episode to another...Long Live Matthew Crawley.  I just have to wait until January now!!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|One of her lesser popular novels, Persuasion speaks  of long lost love reconciled. This BBC version does not disappoint in it's attention to detail and casting of characters. The scenery is also lovely. All in all, it is a great representation of one of literature's great love stories.
B005POK858|5.0|Halfway through seems a little easy so far but still a lot of fun!  No in game purchases is the best part kinda getting old with that especially games we pay for in the first place.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Great movie with perfect actor/actress. Reeves and Bullock tell the story of love separated by years. Only patience will end this twisted story of mixed up fate.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Great fun suitable for gaming teens and nostalgic adults who like a good adventure.<br />I truly enjoyed it and look forward to the movie!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I bought the red color and I have to say I love it. The case has snap-in corners that I was worried might not hold the Kindle tightly enough but they do a good job. The case does well in the stand-up mode. The pseudo-leather looks nice and isn't fraying (yet!) like I thought it might.
0679805273|5.0|I ended up buying six of these books for High School Graduation gift.  Wrote a note and stuck in a gift card for a quick and easy gift.  All books were in excellent condition and no more than two days to receive the books.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This movie might make you cry. It's another fun adventure with Woody, Buzz, and the gang as Andy gets ready to leave for college.
B007SGM084|5.0|Every woman should read this book!!! I even tried to get some men I know to read this maybe they can learn something..... C. Grey!!!!! LOVE IT
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading he other comments about similarity to Shades of Gray I almost didn't read it. There are small similarities and hints of similar character issues but the characters are different. Eve is a much stronger female character. The drama is high but reads like a relationship between two highly damaged individuals who cling to each other because of their traumatic pasts.
6305127689|5.0|LIKE BRAND NEW! WE LOVE IT~THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AAAAA+++++<br />I will ve back again! Thank You so Very much!
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|ive loved demi from her start. her albums just keep getting better & better. there's only a couple songs im not huge on this album...but other than than it's fantastic!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! When I seen it for down load I was sceptical about it. Then it came on!!! I had a blast. I thought is was going to be easy and boring. The easy part was correct for about 1 minute and then it was a race for survival, when the monster started chasing me and I felt my heart start racing. All in all, I really enjoyed this game and I am a 40 year old mama who is hard to impress with games. I recommend this game to everyone.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I had only read the first few chapters in high school English class.  The whole volume is a maginficent achievement in evoking the 1840s era in France -- dealing with the history of the French Revolution in 1797 and the Napoleon era -- showing how those events still resonated in Louis Bonaparte's day.  The students, the milieu in which Jean Valjean is heroic also gives us insights into religious orders (where he hides from the police) and exalts some religious figures.  Provides amazing detail of the Paris sewers as a bonus j-j- history and urban planning buffs will enloy those chapters.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Amazing app but Don't be fooled for the really ridiculous prices!<br />Apart from that though the app is awesome I would recommend the app for you.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Fun lots of action if you like strategy mmo. Slow on th  purchasing of items. But over all fun game.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|It's an Adobe Reader, what can I say. It good to have and a good thing to update often...When need.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was very interesting to read how 4 young men grew and developed their talents while still managing to stay very good friends
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It destroyed me, but I loved every second of it. Be careful cause you will fall in love. Make sure you've got two hours to kill.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Not exactly the murder mystery I though I was in store for. There were a lot of twists and turns I liked. Being narrated by a child makes the sudden leaps ok and undefined actions bearable. It was a good read, though short.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|When I played this game I totally fell in love but 1 thing I don't like is u have to pay real money to UNlock stuff. LILE REALLY???
B0002BO0HG|2.0|I found more to enjoy on 'Cut the World', I particularly enjoyed 'Future Feminism' track. This CD is too noisy and lacks the typical Antony feel.
0345529057|5.0|Fantastic!<br /><br />If you're like me, (you watched the show before reading the books), then you'll find the books incredible, and you'll find yourself saying \\"Oohhhh\\" a lot. It is a million times easier to follow, and definitely more intriguing.<br /><br />I am on the third novel in three months. I can't put them down! Incredible reads, and the show is actually quite accurate, but the book is so much easier to follow with a more in-depth storyline.<br /><br />Recommended!!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's Facebook, so unless you live under a rock you know the basic jist of it.<br /><br />The reasons I rate it three stars is merely because it is becoming more and more annoying with advertising.<br /><br />If I want to know what my friends &#34;Like&#34; I'll go look.  So please give me an option to shut that off from showing up on my timeline.<br />I don't want you spamming my friends timeline with things I've liked (if I want to do that I'll SHARE it thank you).<br />I don't want you spamming my timeline with things I &#34;might&#34; like based my other likes... keep that crap on the side bar.<br />There's more... but the sentiment is the same: Stop spamming crap in people TIMELINES.  Put it in the sidebar.<br /><br />The more annoying Facebook advertising gets the more attractive Google+ becomes over time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|inlike it so far but I have only played the first three levels and this is the first game I have put on my kindle
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I hope they get more rooms soon.  Some were easy, most rooms took a little ..  thinking to complete.  I hope more room come out soon.
B004S49YEM|5.0|I have seen the movie and wanted to read the book and was captivated from the start to the finish.  I could not put it down.
0061733199|4.0|cool book, writing reviews can be annoying but I will say this is worth it. yea I have one done
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|But it keeps on saying I've been kicked because I'm idle in the menus but still an amazing job well done
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The whole family had fun solving the escape. Our 5 year was able to participate. Cannot wait for more rooms to escape.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Foul mouthed, disgusting family. Turned it off after 10 minutes. A waste of money. Don't bother spending your time or money on this one.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|and this is both DVD AND blu-ray.  and the collector's edition.  Great packaging for a wonderful classic movie.  Would definitely buy again.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|A fascinating trip from the beginning of time up to a trillion years into the future. All very interesting and very well written, if one can get past the atheistic gobbledygook (why do some scientists feel they have to burden us with their attempts to disprove the existence of God, when all we want is a clear explanation of the science?). Well, Krauss does indeed provide a clear discussion of current theories of the beginning and evolution of the universe, including recent developments, and he does it in a very interesting way. He manages to do this without oversimplifying and yet without overtaxing the reader who has only a casual understanding of physics. A very enjoyable book.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and has so many great things for the collector included in it.  I gave this as a gift to someone that watches it each Christmas and she just loved it!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|It may take two to three views but this is a fascinating story and film. It's tough to follow but entirely satisfying if you give it the time.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|and it was a great price too.  I gave this as a gift to someone that has wanted it for so long!
B00BDSRISA|3.0|not great. certainly not equal in any way to their first or second album and perhaps not even as good as their last. unfortunately it sounds as though Phoenix has given in to that insideous temptation to sound current and mainstream, sacrificing songs in the processing, and even the pure joy of music making. this is one synth pop song after another -- sounding surprisingly boring and uninspired.
B004J64QSI|5.0|As a complete theatre nerd, I am very critical about shows; the cast, the acting, and the singing have to be spot on for me. I did see the movie that came out and I was a little disappointed because some of the cast members, though great actors, were not great singers and that is sort of the whole point of a musical. The beautiful this about this version is the way there is hardly any stage direction. The actors have to portray everything through their voices and how they act the song. Though this may make it a little bit harder to follow, it allows the person watching it to experience the show in a whole new way. It makes a person pay attention not only to the words of the songs to see what's going on but to really listen to how the writers of the show delicately wrote and produced such a beautiful show. Now I know some of you may be hesitant to watch because of Nick Jonas, and believe me, I was to, but try to see him as Marius and only Marius. If you think about Nick Jonas and his days as a mediocre Disney channel star, then you are setting yourself up for disappointment. I guarantee you this, If you look at the artistry and beauty behind this show, you will love it just as much as I do! Plus, Javert isn't played by Russel Crowe so that's already an improvement!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Me and my other half loved playing this together but was unhappy at the length, challenging and will make you work your brain but has those moments where you go &quot;dang I should have tried that!&quot;
B002VPE1B6|5.0|great movie & arrived on time! Ive been wanting a blu-ray version of this movie for a long time, also it was a good price!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|If you love Angry Birds than you will love this game. It was a great way to spend time without spending money.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Great Movie & got it for a real good price! The movie I got actually had a 3D version also :)
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is just fun, with so many levels and chapters this game is sure to help you spend your time.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Only a few words can describe the epicness that is Dungeon Hunter 4:<br />-EXCELLENT (and I mean EXCELLENT) storyline! It kept me hooked from the moment I hit the start button!<br />-great graphics (battle and area/land graphics)<br />-Demons = EPICALLY CREATIVE! Almost as if the GameLoft people have the best imaginations in the history of imaginations<br />-character selection/voice effects = AMAZING! LOVE LOVE LOVE the English accents!!!<br />-battlefield fights = AWESOME! Especially when the demons (mainly imps) crawl out of the swirling blue portals which appear from NOWHERE!, just pop up when you are in attack distance<br />-weapons = EPIC!!!! Deal acceptable amount of damage, but when you reach level 3,4, or 5, you might wanna consider getting a more powerful weapon... Trust me!<br /><br />  Keep up the good work, GameLoft!!!!!!!!!!!! &lt;33333333333333
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I loved \\"MMMbop\\" but didn't turn into a Hanson fan. If you, like I, were waiting for them to grow up and prove their talent, I'm afraid we missed the boat. These young men are now:<br />1) gifted singers<br />2) talented musicians<br />3) inspired wordsmiths<br />4) musically diverse and skilled<br /><br />And, oh, the blue-eyed soul! I was afraid \\"Get the Girl Back\\" was going to be an anomaly, but the whole album is this good. Rock, Rockabilly, soul, R & B, with 60's influences, rock instrumentals that will blow your socks off, fantastic harmonies, Taylor's amazing vocals, and a dreamily beautiful love song called \\"Juliet\\", this has it all. I will need no other album until at least Fall, so I'm sure this will be my \\"music to always remind me of Summer 2013\\", but this thing will never die. It is bound to be instituted as THE CLASSIC HANSON ALBUM, and AN ALL-TIME CLASSIC ALBUM.<br /><br />Hanson, thank you from the bottom of my heart!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Very exciting and i love the game. If you like competitive games you will love this game.4 out of 5 stars
B008CLI4N4|5.0|It surpassed any expectation i had. the characters,the story line,the scenery, the acting was excellent. Felt like i was there.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love the crossover novels. Reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5: it was supposed to be the end of the set.. now I'm waiting again!
B005IT0V8O|5.0|The Elements of Style was a valuable tool I used while writing my novel, &#34;Baker's Gold&#34;.  It boils down the many rules of grammar and style into useful elements that are easily digested.  The section about using the active voice was especially helpful, as were the exercises.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like the fact that I may access my email via my kindle.  It has a few issues in my mind but i generally like the ease at which I may sync my kindle with my PC and be able to access my email.  I like that I can keep it open on my kindle and not have to log in each and every time.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Nice app, my daughter is really into art and loves using this one. she can draw and even save it i would recommend this one
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I do not like the kindle camera because it is very hard to take a picture that you are not in.  Unless the kindle is in front of you, you are unable to see what you may be taking a picture of.  I know this is not a camera persay, but it is difficult to take pictures of people or things unless you yourself are in front facing the kindle. I do not want to be in every picture I take and this makes it difficult to just take a picture of something/someone else.  I am new to the kindle so maybe I just dont know how to use the device properly yet.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|Dr Panda rocks! if you have a toddler you need to get all the DR panda apps! We have them all and my son loves them all...even the daycare and beauty salon..he plays them all!
0156027321|4.0|I need to read it in my high school. It's absorbing, but the only thing I dislike is the paper. It seems mass market paper, some words are even blurred.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|deleted it right away, too many ads and it wouldnt work right...blahh..wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Skip it! Thank goodness it was free
0143038583|5.0|I can't imagine I can even find a book rather than fiction engaging. It's awesome, I can learn a lot from it.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|I got this because it was the free app of the day so i figured what the heck. It is ok...none of us really got the hang of it and I ended up deleting it...not our favorite
B006UW4OB8|1.0|This app is nice in my Iphone because I can sync it with my Mac, but couldn't do it with my android phone. I found this inconvenient after I bought it for 9.99 dollars. I would like to have all my info sync in my two phones.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging, and passes the time beautifully! I travel a lot for work and it's nice to keep the brain engaged.
B00C6B9H46|5.0|The sole reason for me buying this movie is because I am a collector. The product arrived on time and in great condition. I did not open the package... simply added it to my other Steelbox movies. If you are a fellow collector... I would not hesitate to recommend this Steelcase movie for your collection.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|The new Oz is a great move. the writers did a great job putting a new story together that ties in with the original.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Our daughter got us tickets to see The National in  Raleigh (concert was a few weeks ago and superb). We knew this new release would be out before the concert, and downloaded it on Amazon as soon as it was available. We came to The National through Boxer and Alligator, which we loved...thoroughly enjoyed High Violet, so expecations were high - and met!<br /><br />Right after we got the album we heard them review it on the NPR Saturday afternoon show Sound Opinions...they talked about how depressing it was, how they made the same album yet again, how they resembled Coldplay, blah blah - they didn't trash it, but clearly were not at all impressed (then again, when we hear them give rave reviews to some things that are nothing more than annoying noise, we are reminded that musical taste is a personal thing - so I forgive you, Sound Opinions dudes!)...<br /><br />Ah, to the album in question, Trouble Will Find Me. Just as with all great albums (Arcade Fire's The Suburbs come to mind), you listen through, a few things click, you wonder...then you lie in bed and some of the songs jump in to your thoughts and you can't wait until you can listen to it again. The band sounds great, the singer's voice works just right on every song. Much of the music is actually quite beautiful. Some of it rocks hard (and it rocks harder the closer you listen and louder you play it).  Be sure to listen to it all the way through - the best songs are sprinkled around, and they save some of the best for last.<br /><br />Very highly recommended indeed.....
B0091QSNEE|5.0|You really cant go wrong with Dr Panda. Both my kids love all of the apps (3 and 9 year olds) and I even find myself playing these with them. They are fun, great graphics and they learn from them.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My son and I loved the film.  Much less expensive than buying through Lego!  Would deal with again, thank you!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|one of the best move-videogame tie up ever created good grafics. and is so anamated I am in love with it
1781162646|1.0|Why do you not have a book in Kindle format? I stopped reading your books when all the women abuse become topic of choice.  It's been a while and so I thought \\"Stephen King\\" yes I'm going back to Stephen!  Then I found, with horror, that you do not offer your books in Kindle format.  I am really sorry you don't use it.<br /><br />Back to Dean Koontz...  So sad to have to put you on the back burner.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For a couple of years I avoided The Hunger Games book and movie. I thought it would be like &#34;Lord of the Flies,&#34; which I had read in college and found distressing and depressing. I'm not sure why I decided to read the first book but by the second chapter I was hooked. I was surprised and pleased to find there were two sequels. I needed to find out what happened to Katniss, Peeta, and their world. I sped through all three books and have watched the movie twice. I found Katniss' bravery and survival instincts captivating. I could feel the confusion and need she felt in her relationship with Peeta. And I thought the symbolism and metaphors within the story, of a country's fight agains crass indifference and tyranny, were profound. I was happy I decided to read them on Kindle. I was able to download the sequels fast - maintaining steady momentum through the addictive plot and its events.
1439107955|5.0|I congratulate Dr. Mukharjee in writing a stunning and beautiful account of the history of how we see cancer. I have said to many of my colleagues how difficult it is to write a book that not only the lay public but also oncologists greatly enjoy.  It gave me great insight into where I stand in this small section of the long history of these diseases. It humbled me but also made me appreciate how those who came before had to use their brains and the tools available to try and fight these great problems.  Those in the future will also look at us and be amused but I take comfort in looking back with the same understanding.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I love all the DR Panda apps. I think they are probably my 3 year old's most favorite apps. We have them all and he plays them all the time. They teach things like colors, numbers etc along with coordination and i like that this one even teaches about recycling.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|THIS IS A VERY CHALLENGING MIND GAME. IT TAKES A LOT OF SEARCHING AND THINKING TO SOLVE EACH LEVEL A MOVE FORWARD.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Really really great. A true classic literary work. I highly recommend this work for everyone in the family and friends.
B002JXK5VU|3.0|I watched one episode of this quirky series, but do not feel inclined to watch any more. It simply didn't do enough to warrant spending any more time on it.
0679805273|4.0|As you would expect a Dr. Seuss to be excellant, it is.  I gave this to my grandson for pre-school graduation.  His mom plans to have his teacher write something about him every year of his school career on a page in the book.  Great idea.  Also think the book suitable for high school or college graduates.
B008478VE8|3.0|i think my problems were that the writing is terribly dry and the information, while excellent, is not exciting. if you do not want to sleep in the next 20 mins, dont read it. very good for right before bed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Im a pinterest junkie anyway and being able to access it on my kindle is just great!!! If you haven't pinterested then you really need too!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I can hardly believe this game is FREE it's so fun! Several stages, vehicle types, and vehicle upgrades to unlock by collecting coins strewn within stages, progressing farther for awards, and performing tricks. Some of the stages feature lower gravity or slippery slopes, which makes flipping and getting air time awards easier, but maintaining control an interesting challenge. TIP: Make loads of money on the Moon with an upgraded 4-wheel drive!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Well crafted novel.  I really enjoy Scalzi's style of writing.  Style reminds me of Heinlein and Orson Scott Card.  I will read more from this author.
0451209338|4.0|This may be the best, if not the most didactic, of the Allon series so far.  Silva never fails to deliver.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|All u haters get outta here. Kanye has proved once and for all that he is not a gay fish, he is more like the Aquaman of the hip-hop ocean. Kanye drops some acid with some help from Daft Punk. If you can't handle it, you might be a swallower.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Excellent book, but egregious OCR/Editing errors.  Almost 1 error per page.  Terrible work.  Really distracting.  Look at other eBook publishers before Kindle edition if you can.  Hopefully they will have a better rendition.
B00D8RYV52|5.0|I leave the same review on every Dr Panda...LOVE them..every time a new one comes out I buy it. my 3 and 9 year olds both love them..esp my three year old..not only are they fun but they learn from it as well. If you have a toddler you cant go wrong with Dr Panda.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|Great cast another Scorsese masterpiece as good as Goodfellas and because these characters did exist in Vegas with different names makes it more compelling. The only Gangster genre better than this are all 3 Godfather movies. Before you throw eggs at #3 it is the logical death of Michael Corleone and the critics and public were too critical of it.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|The script is solid.  The acting is top notch.  The action sequences are hyper real and believable. This movie also contains one of the best long shot sequences in the history of cinema. You will not be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addictive!  Please hurry with the new rooms.  Not just a  mindless game.  You have to use some logical thinking.  Good game!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Works great.  The first time I paired it it did not work well, redid the pairing and it is all good. Love the charging case.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app for quick notes and so many other purposes. Nice functionality within the app for organization and use of notes.
B008NMT684|4.0|we have the free version, my son likes this..although it isnt very challenging and doesnt hold his attention for long, but he still does the puzzles because he likes trucks
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Love it addictive you will love it not a waste of time  this game is  a lot of fun I recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|get this game now<br />creepers, spiders, fire, zombies, build your house the way you want, no one can tell you what to do ever, make some cake at least

B00AF6MF9I|1.0|I feel all gameloft games are designed for the sole purpose of in game purchases with real money. they aren't even trying anymore. it is game after game of 'too hard unless u pay' and even after u buy something, it quickly gets too hard again. waste of time.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|The cast and costumes are great.  There has been disappointing scene so far that was not true to the book, but otherwise things have matched up pretty well.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|There were several very challenging puzzles which made the game that much more enjoyable.  I enjoyed the last set of puzzles which allowed each puzzle to be solved in a number of different ways.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun for all ages. Graphics are wonderful and earning pearls is easy. I would recommend this game to anyone. Download and enjoy playing.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game that works really well on kindle fire. I am a horse lover and owner and love the fact there is at least one of thease little owning games for the kindle. the only thing that hugged me was the western tack for english showing. also it takes a lot of time to gain energy.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so much fun that me and my brother play this game all the time! Random hi there man or woman
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|If you enjoy games that require you to build a city and collect resources within a certain amount of time, you'll love Royal Envoy. In this beautifully detailed game, you're tasked with rebuilding the towns and cities on surrounding islands devastated by a storm. The free version provided you with access to two islands, after which you had to pay $4.99 to access the rest of the game (9 islands in all). This paid version provides you with access to the full game for a bargain price of $0.99. (The price has since gone back to $4.99, but it is still an excellent game for that price.)<br /><br />For that price, it simply can't be beat. The graphics are spectacular, and the sound is excellent. The game mechanisms are simple enough to learn quickly but the game tasks challenging enough to keep you entertained for a long time as you attempt to better your score on each level. Highly recommended.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Even though we can only listen to a few songs at a time, we couldn't listen to an entire album either, it is great to here his words again. Not for someone who hasn't listen to Bob. So buy and earlier work and then listen to the words and music on this one.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game for children or adults. Very educational and the graphics are amazing. Great game to play to kill some time.

B005VPXNV2|5.0|Always been a huge Kathy bates fan. You actually get to see how great of an actress that she is in this movie.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This album has truly blown me away. I haven't listened to anything else over the last two weeks.<br /><br />I haven't been so excited by an album in the last few years. It actually reminds me of why I got into metal in the first place... It has energy, pounding rhythms, interesting lyrical topics and some awesome melodies. It's a shame that so many modern metal fans seem to be so against a song having an actual catchy melody. I don't see this as a weekness of Dave Mustaine, but an incredible strength that sets him apart from most of his peers.<br /><br />Every song is a highlight (although I'm still getting used to the more radio friendly title track)but standouts for me include Kingmaker, Dance in the Rain, Forget to Remember, Don't turn your Back and the bonus track A House Divided.<br /><br />This is an exciting album from Megadeth and helps me to remember the kind of joy I felt listening to metal albums when I first got into metal over 25 years ago. I've caught myself smiling so many times when something on this album has really connected with me. It's that kind of special album.<br /><br />Well done Dave Mustaine and Megadeth. History will record this album as another classic!
0062014536|4.0|I enjoyed this final book in the Delirium trilogy.  It was packed with action and just a little bit of romance.<br /><br /> I do have to say that I don't remember much about the first two books in the series.  And I didn't really get much help in the way of remembering.  But I still enjoyed it.<br /><br /> I liked how the story was told from both Lena's point of view and from Hana's point of view.  And I think the two sides came nicely at the end.<br /><br /> All of the characters were well written.  Once again, I loved Lena and Julian and my feelings for Alex changed at the end (I won't tell you which way).<br /><br /> But the end left me wanting more.  It didn't answer all my questions.  Alex or Julian?  What happens to Hanna?  What becomes of the \\"cure\\" or freedom?  I think there could easily be a fourth book.

B000063DFN|5.0|This is considered to be a classic metal album by many fans of the genre and considered to be one of Maiden's best. This is only the third album I've heard from this band and I'd have to say that the good songs on here are very well crafted, but as an album, I enjoyed listening to Brave New World and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son more. By any rate though, this is one metal band that every fan of the genre needs to have in their collection! Bruce Dickinson easily one of the all time best metal vocalists to ever touch the planet! He puts on a great performance through this album. Steve Harris is a total expert at bass. Only Geddy Lee and John Myung are better bassists to my ears. Nicko is a solid drummer on this album. Doing his usual thing. Smith and Murray do deliver a great performance! I must say that any guitar player who wants to learn how to sound good needs to listen to this album. But Seventh Son...is a bit better on the guitar work in my opinion.<br /><br />The Music:<br /><br />1. Aces High- This is the song I heard that persuaded me to buy the album. It also holds a place in my heard as the first Iron Maiden song I ever heard. The opening is just epic! The guitar harmonies are just spectacular and Bruce is just ripping up some good vocals throughout the song! The bass is very clear in the mix and due to Steve's skill, sounds like a lower guitar part rather than a bass! The drumming is absolutely great! It gives a good beat to the song! The guitar parts and passages through the song are just plain AWESOME! This is what awesome was in 1984! High flying solos and melodies with a strong and overly skilled rhythm section! The lyrics deal with WWII plane pilots. Much better than hair metal stuff in my opinion. This is very good song and it remains one of my favorites by this band! Great classic!<br /><br />2. 2 Minutes to Midnight- This song was played on the radio back in the 80's from what I hear (I wasn't around back then). I'd much rather hear this over whatwe get on radios today *rolls eyes*. As far as lyrics go, this is a typical 80's metal sound, but as Maiden goes, this is a true classic song! I do like the music in it! Good things going on from each member and good lyrics! Bruce sounds so good on this one! This isn't as heavy as the opener, but again, this was apparently a radio track, so it is more listener friendly, however it's length is long for the radio (which means more heaven for the listener). The guitar solo in this song is top notch as usual, what else would we get from Maiden? Nicko provides a pretty solid drum track for this one! Very good song!<br /><br />3. Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)- This is apparently Maiden's last instrumental to date. It is pretty comparable to Rush's YYZ in terms of grooving and being heavy, but it isn't as interesting to listen to in my opinion. It's definitely an impressive song with some flashy soloing and harmonizing, but as an instrumental it really doesn't catch my ears too much. Not a bad track though!<br /><br />4. Flash of the Blade- This song starts off with a pretty catchy riff courtesy of Adrian and David! Then it turns into a pretty epic song! I like the chorus of this one! Bruce shows us his range some more like he did on Aces High. The riff is just awesome! It makes the song distinct! The verse have some good riffing/chugging and the harmonizing and melodies are quite Godly in the middle! The guitar work is just amazing! I love the instrumental work this song features! Steve and Nicko are THE best Metal rhythm section in history. Period. I like other ones, but these two are just over the top amazing! Great stuff throughout the song! Awesome track!<br /><br />5. The Duelists- The guitar work continues to amaze me in this one. The part where we actually have Bruce on board is pretty amazing and full of some high, vocals! Then it's up to some dueling guitars to keep the song going! (Hence the name I'm guessing). Nobody harmonizes like these guys. Not even Jesper and Björn of In Flames can do harmonies like this! These harmonies are the original, heavy metal harmonies that influenced everything we have in metal today! Nothing can beat it! The solos in here are just as epic! They are so skilled at their craft and Harris keeps a good bass line going! And Nicko gives us some pretty good fills and some awesome beats! I love the triplet feel of this song! I've seen Iron Maiden live and I wish they would have played this, I would've loved to hear how it sounds with Janick added to the fold! Oh well, it's still a great song on this album! Classic Maiden!<br /><br />6. Back in the Village- This song isn't bad by any means! It's a complete shredfest! But to my ear it doesn't hold up to the tracks around it. It's a good solid track, there isn't a bad song on here, but if there is one track here that isn't essential, I'd say it's this one. It just doesn't catch my attention as much and I'm not a fan of this one.<br /><br />7. Powerslave- AWESOME, GROOVING, POWER, and EPIC come to mind when describing this title track! The riff on this one just hits you like a train at full force! This song is where we get that Egyptian artwork from! This song has some very Egyptian-esque melodies in the verses and Bruce's performance on this is just draw dropping! I love his vocals on this song! Smith and Murray do the signature Maiden gallop on this one and sprinkle in some Egyptian flavoring into the openings to close it up. The bass is great as usual, typical Steve Harris bass track and Nicko is playing a rather impressive track here! The song has some definite progressive influences. It becomes soft after the 2nd chorus and features a very melodic guitar solo! Then it picks back up with a more flashy solo. I've always loved how Iron Maiden uses progressive influences to further set themselves apart from the rest of old school heavy metal! This is definitely a classic Maiden song! This song doesn't get enough credit for what it is! It ROCKS!!! This is one of their better title track songs! Awesome 80's metal classic!<br /><br />8. Rime of the Ancient Mariner- At 13:33, this is not your typical song. It is a true epic! This is filled to the limit with wrist-breaking riffs, ear-friendly melodies, and epic moments! This is definitely a strong point in the album! The opening part alone is worth the listen! Bruce sings with that signature aggressive style and mixes it with his \\"Air Siren\\" high pitches effortlessly! The riffs and the drums are some of the heaviest and most flashy and progressive on the album! The song takes off BOOM just like that into an amazing triplet style rocker! Filled with more of the special Maiden guitar parts and some great Nicko style drumming! Harris is great, we all know that, but he really comes through on this song! It's hard to believe that he's finger picking all those notes that the speed they're going! Most bassists would have used an actual pick! The middle of the song turns into an atmospheric area with some very unnerving and eerie guitar parts going. Then there is some whispers over it and then the eerie music continues until it resolves into a more melodic part that is absolutely Maiden! This song is just great! Steve Harris is one heck of a songwriter! He wrote this whole thing!!! This is a very essential Maiden classic! CHECK IT OUT!<br /><br />Verdict: This was the first Iron Maiden album I bought and now I have 12/15 albums (I only buy studio albums so yeah. They have well over 20 Live albums alone). This is a great album to start with! Aces High and Rime of the Ancient Mariner are timeless metal classics. If you're a metal fan and you don't like Iron Maiden, you're not a metal fan. Everyone always says that not liking Metallica is heresy in the Metal World...well not liking Iron Maiden is even more heresy when everything we know about metal today is rooted to Iron Maiden. Without Maiden we'd have no Metallica, Megadeth, and therefore a severe lack of metal. So be thankful and respect this band. Up the Irons! So buy this!
159463176X|3.0|I've read all three of Hosseini's books--\\"The Kite Runner,\\" \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" and \\"And the Mountains Echoed.\\"  I preferred \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" the most and \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" the least.  Hosseini is a good author.  While his first two works had flaws, they were flaws that made the reader think of how he could have done it better, which made those flaws forgivable.  In this novel, Hosseini tries to play with narratives in much the same way that Amy Tan did with \\"The Joyluck Club\\" or Jennifer Eagan did with \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad.\\"  However, as simple and easy as such unconventional story telling appears, it takes a lot of skill, and I don't think Hosseini was quite able to pull it off.  For me, the best part of the novel was the story of Suleiman (Pari's adoptive wealthy father) and Nabi (his butler). I believe the novel would have been better if Hosseini had selected only a few story lines and characters and discarded the rest.  Then he could have foced on developing the story and characters in a more unified and intricate way.

After listening, I was left thinking. \\"What was he thinking?\\" It's a bit harsh & lacks the \\"smile\\" vibe Kanye usually brings. Kudos for expression but he could have kept this one to himself.

0385535147|3.0|A page turner...however,  the premise of the whole novel is so wildly improbable from the get-go that it was ruined for me.  The whole thing is a writer's fantasy built upon fantasy.  I'm sure Grisham is laughing all the way to the bank.

0060853980|5.0|I first read Good Omens 20 years ago, I loved it then and still love it now, I read it every couple of years. It's funny, sarcastic, irreverent, silly and clever. Terry Pratchett is a king when it comes to writing social awkwardness and Newton Pulsifer is one of his best. The mix of characters in all the story lines are well observed and sympathetic with one of my favorite supporting characters - Thou-Shalt-Not-Comit-Adultery Pulsifer (Witchfinder General) making me laugh whenever he's on the page. The combo of the 2 authors together is a fabulous blend of styles.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone with an appreciation of religious history/prophecy, sarcasm, irony and quirky characters.

B007MDB71O|5.0|The acting by the two leads is fair but the supporting cast and story line are great and Disney does an outstanding job making it all quite believable.  Love the idea of finding an artifact in the old west, being transported to our neighboring planet, Mars, finding a whole new action packed life, complete with super powers and a new found love, especially after having lost everything near and dear on Earth, and tying it all neatly in with a well known 19th century science fiction writer.  Then, just when you think all is well, John gets ripped away from his new life by a group of super powerful diabolical beings bent on systematically depleting all the natural resources from each planet in our solar system, and has to find his way back to the world and woman that he loves to save both from total destruction.  Can't wait to see the sequel !  (Surely Disney is planning one, right?)

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This sequel is so much better than the original; in particular, the special effects and the acting are great.  And the musical score, from start to finish is outstanding !  Would love to see them go back and redo the original in the same technical/lighting format as the second movie.  And there has to be a sequel to &#34;Legacy&#34; to show what happens to his Dad and what the son and new found girl friend do, now that they have escaped the computer world and are back in real life.  Does the son go back into the computer from the real world side, eliminate &#34;Clue&#34;, go back in the computer, find and rescue his dad to the real world, then son & dad and (new life form) girl friend break new frontiers by completely redefining the human condition ?  Love the 2nd movie so much, really hope they do a sequel.  Based on where they left off in the 2nd, the 3rd movie could be a block buster.

B00BP29SAA|4.0|I really like this game. It gives a realistic set of problems to solve in a supermarket setting. My 5 year old, however, hasn't managed to figure out how to make it work. Unlike other dr panda products which are instantly intuitive, this one requires more involvement. It has a slightly different feel to it than the other games and that makes it a bit more difficult to initially get involved in. You have to tap on the creatures multiple times but they don't have thinking bubbles as other dr panda games have (which prompt the user to tap them). Also, environmental items require interaction, but this is not entirely obvious at first. Honestly, it's lots of fun but my daughter needs some &#34;questing sparkles&#34; to get her started.
B00B29J0I6|1.0|this is supposed to be a puzzle game<br /><br />and yet on lvl 10 you have three boxes to blow up and after each box you get a pop up achievement window that completely blocks the screen and by the time you close it the level has failed and it happens on each box ? like I even want to know , \\"hey you blew up a box \\" over and over  if you insist on making that an achievement at least put it at the end of the level not freakin in the middle of the puzzle

1476719071|2.0|*This is my own opinion that shouldn't influence you. If you feel like buying the book, do it. You might love it.*<br /><br />I have to recognize that I wwas dying to read `Beautiful Disaster' for ages. Everybody was talking about it, everybody was reading and everybody was saying how awesome it is. So, after I read all those amazing reviews, I expected a book that would knock me down. Instead, `Beautiful Disaster' dissapointed me. And I soooo wanted to love it!<br /><br />INTENSE. Nope.<br />DANGEROUS. Yeah, for those super naive girls that believe that a psycho-boyfriend it's something good.<br />ADDICTIVE. Not even close.<br /><br />I think this book is one of those books that you either love or loathe. Well, I was somewhere in between. I didn't love it, but I didn't loathe it either. It left me kind of... indiferent. There were good parts and bad parts. Scenes when I wanted to throw it away and scenes were I really liked it. That depended on Travis's and Abby's mood.<br /><br />What annoyed me the most? Travis. My god, I wanted to beat him so hard!! What was his problem? He was an idiot sometimes! Of course, he had his moments when he was cute. But most of the time, he was an obsessed, idiot, absolutely annoying hot guy. He annoyed me when he thought that he's the boss, when he was jealous, when he wanted to protect Abby but instead he was just an annoying `boyfriend'.<br /><br />And Abby! What a naive chick! Why was he tolerating Travis?! This book encourages girls to believe that a boyfriend that is overprotective and treats you like his own toy is something good. I can't understand why this book is labeled as YA. This is something that naive teenagers shouldn't read. Yeah, I'm 15, so I'm a teenager. But believe me, sometimes I think I'm 30.<br /><br />`Beautiful Disaster' is full of clichee. I mean, a good (tehnically) girl falls for a bad guy. Oh noo, I haven't read about this before. Just a million times.<br /><br />I think the author is talented. I liked her writing style. It's simple, easy to follow and hooking. But this book has a serious lack of imagination. I mean, America?! Seriously?!<br /><br />I still don't get it why this book is so famous. Because of a psychopath, a naive girl, those clichees? I read indie books that are better. Waaaaay better.<br /><br />What I liked about this book? As I said, when Travis was NOT an overprotective and they (meaning Travis and Abby) were normal, those scenes made me rate this book with a 2.5<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying and reading `Beautiful Disaster'. It stopped my curiousity. And yes, I will read `Walking Disaster', but only because I wanna see what he really thought about Abby in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />I rate this book with 2.5.

B00C81AVNU|4.0|Bought this after seeing Kinky Boots in NYC April 2013.  The CD is true to the live experience.  Cyndi Lauper's score is diverse with a variety of different music styles.  You can more fully appreciate some of her clever lyrics that sometimes get glossed over in the live theater setting.  It may not be the most insightful or ground-breaking musical to win the Tony for Best Musical, but it's pure fun.

B007RI56NY|2.0|There is more music proposed for the album, that for some unknown reason Sony has withheld it until the 25th of this month. I bought it with the intention of obtaining all the music they listed, but the result was missing music. Can't but feel ripped off by the colloberation of Amazon and Sony. Would be nice if they'd contact me and make the real (Full) album available in my download que...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun to play and a good thinker it makes you problem solve. I look toward to many more rooms. cant wait.
0425264351|5.0|While I agree there are some threads that could be pulled to unravel some of the story's plot points, I choose to overlook them and just enjoy Reacher in all his Reacher-ness. This was Child's first effort, and while I agree he would not have left some glaring missteps in later efforts, the action and overall good story make me want to cut him some slack. If every detail has to ring true for you, skip this one. If you just are looking for a good story and don't want to analyze it too closely, I think you'll like it as much as I did.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Very cute! Love Drew, Loved reading it from his point of view. Very cute and entertaining! Definitely keeping this author on my radar for future books!
B005M5OSBK|5.0|as said a very nice cd, a nice mix of different songs and styles. This is my second Pink Martini cd. Becoming a fan!
B000002AGN|5.0|Dave's music moves me and is extremely relaxing!  If you need to unwind after a long day, listen to this CD!
0375842209|5.0|One of the best books i've ever read.<br />An emotional and intersting story<br />Greatly written and i highly recommend it
B005HJWWW8|4.0|It does what it says with aplomb. I have not heard any harmonic deviations that were not due to exterior devices. In other words, it does not in-and-of-itself exhibit any discolorations of the audio signal that I have been able to discern apart from the Bluetooth transmitter I am using in conjunction with it.  It simply amplifies it, and that is all I wanted it to do. Very simply, it is the best.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is our favorite show and we love watching it together. I purchase every new season as a gift for my husband so we don't have to watch the commercials on TV.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i think since this is for mobal devices it is awsome. one reason is it has the most important thing. BUTTER
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I can't wait to catch up to what's recording now. I just started Season 2! It is expensive to purchase on Amazon. I can watch it free on Uverse on-demand.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|OMG!!! I couldnt put the book down. Finished reading in less than a day<br />Such a beautiful and sad story.<br />Kept sobbing- i cant even remember if i ever cried from reading a book.<br />Highly recommend it
B0028MBKVG|5.0|What an inspirational book for all that thought they couldn't run! I recommend this book for all beginning runners and for those who gave it up for what ever reasons.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|I do not have it on my kindle. Will not let me finish set up. Would rather have it removed if it wil not work.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Anything this guy writes is amazing.  Apparently he wanted 4 and 5 to be one book, but it would have been way too long, so I understand.  A story needs to be told correctly, even if it means some parts may not equal others.  I still enjoyed it, and will read the rest.  I'm addicted.
0312427999|5.0|I'm not going to lie. This is a dense book that requires some concentration and dedication  to get through and understand. However, I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning how our global economy became both enormously stratified between the very poor and the very wealthy and addicted to the stock market highs that come from outside investment in foreign nations that can only occur when something has gone terribly wrong inside that nation.<br />The author Naomi Klein does a really fantastic job of tracing her theory of shock capitalism from its roots in the psychological experiments of a Canadian doctor who believed that he could treat mentally ill people by shocking their damaged personality out of them and then, once this damaged personality was obliterated, rebuilding a healthy one on top. Unfortunately, while the doctor found the trick to erasing people by forcing them to endure electric shock therapy, sensory deprivation and other tortuous treatments, he never was able to rebuild his patients in a healthy manner.<br />Klein then brings in the main actor of the book, economist Milton Friedman, and explains how he and his vast army of fundamentalist capitalists, used similar methods to enter countries which were undergoing vast shocks to their systems, such as South America in the 1970s, South Africa just after the end of apartheid, or Russia in the 1990s, and took advantage of these shocks to paste over the destruction with their own dogma of unregulated markets and privatized industry. The result was economies which made a great deal of money for very few people and left the majority of the population destitute.<br />As someone who has long been concerned about the vast disparity in the wealth distribution around the world, as well as in our own country, and who was searching for answers as to how this disparity came to exist, I think I was probably predisposed to accept Klein's theory. However, I think that anyone who is interested in economics or world politics will find something to interest them.in economics or world politics will find something to interest them.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Such an interesting story and greatly written from the chosen point of view.<br />I read it recently just before the story of the 3 young girls that were captive got released.<br />I really liked it and highly recommend it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy these types of games and this app is great. It's not to difficult and its not boringly easy either. I hope the get more floors soon :)
B0013ND36G|5.0|This was purchased as a gift when my husband got a new blue ray player. We were curious to see the differene in the  blue ray vs DVd. We couldn't tell the difference. Of course that could be just us. The movie was great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it is soo fun to hunt for stuff to open the elevator and go to the next level and it gets harder every level I'm stuck on level 10
B003YL4LYI|4.0|My first kindle read.  Back to the main characters apparently.  I'm almost intentionally lagging, because I know book 6 isn't out yet.  I love this guy's stuff.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I love Bruno Mars....he is Michael Jackson like quality....great album not surprised or disappointed as his last album was great as well.
0345528581|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son who was looking for information on bodyweight exercises. He was very happy with it and found the exercise descriptions to be quite easy to follow.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|I have loved OneRepublic since they first came out with Apologize and I think they just keep getting better and better. I believe this CD is more upbeat than their others, which I like. I love just about every song on the album!
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|This was purchased as a gift when my husband got a new blue ray player. We were curious to see the differene in the  blue ray vs DVd. We couldn't tell the difference. Of course that could be just us. The movie was great.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I was able to download this app but it will not install on my kindle fire. Waste of time. Guess I'll stick to watching youtube videos on my phone.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|This is a wonderful action figure and looks like the actor who played Superman in the movie &#34;Man of Steel&#34;. The figure has great articulation and comes with a display stand with Superman's &#34;S&#34; chest emblem on it. This would be great for a comic book or action figure collector or it would make a good action figure toy for a child (over 3 yrs. old) to play with. I recommend this product.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it and need more levels to play; just don't wan t to have to pay for anything. that's right I'm cheap
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|I bought this EP cause I heard the song royals in the radio and loved it.  I have not been disappointed.  All 5 songs are great!  Her lyrics are masterful and her music is delightful.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is like the best app ever. The only thing that disappointed me was it wasn't like x box version.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|This was purchased as a gift when my husband got a new blue ray player. We were curious to see the differene in the  blue ray vs DVd. We couldn't tell the difference. Of course that could be just us. The movie was great.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I downloaded this but when I read that it wants exact GPS location data I decided not to install it.  There is no reason for a game to have my location. I am not going to install it and I suggest others don't either.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The app is pretty fun me and m<br />y son play  it alot but the guns are perfect and the facts are true my fav is stg 44
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|what a good idea! a new twist on an old game and it's more fun than ever!<br />this really keeps you on your toes and you have to think in terms of both strategy<br />and speed. it's a lot of fun and the kids love it as much as I do.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This game is really great, but I just wish there was more maps and more people to pick from make funny and creative weapons! Make land mines that people could pick up and put down to wait for some one to fall on it Make the stealth soldiers completely invisible but players could only see the stealth soldier's name so they have a little of a hint! Make new things and bigger maps, make a Blitz Brigade 2!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please Game loft we all want to see the second one please consider it you won't be sorry!!!!!! This is coming from one of your customers, and this is what we want!!!!!!!
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Felt connected to Harold, rooting for him throughout his travels but other characters and interactions with Harold left me feeling flat. Nice message but was disappointed when all was said and done. :(
B00AEFY08O|5.0|This was purchased as a gift when my husband got a new blue ray player. We were curious to see the differene in the  blue ray vs DVd. We couldn't tell the difference. Of course that could be just us. The movie was great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Makes you think, but not hard. Just have to use common sense. Have to figure out which steps to find the item to open the doors.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Very AMAZING read . Hoping for more books like these . They had a great story line. The books will be passed on so my sister can read them too. THANKS !!!!!!!!!
B0026PA05M|5.0|Really great album. There's not one cut that isn't worth listening to although my personal fav might be American Boys;)
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I luv all of nalini Singh 's books and read them over and over again.  I'm always anxious for the next book to come out. Aloha
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I actually was never a Maroon 5 fan prior to this album. I found them poppy and cheesy. But this album is excellent, and now I'm going to their concert in August!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This was purchased as a gift when my husband got a new blue ray player. We were curious to see the differene in the  blue ray vs DVd. We couldn't tell the difference. Of course that could be just us. The movie was great.
0439023521|5.0|Along with most of the other reviewers this book had me in the first two pages and I didn't want to put it down! Fantastic!
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|The previews looked good and we rented this movie FOR THE FAMILY, only to hear the F bomb go off every other word, plenty of skin and adult themes. Great how about rating the stupid thing its an R at least.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I've always taken exception to the title of this movie.  Armageddon is the site of a battle of Biblical proportions, not a lazy generic term that's needlessly applied to every disaster known to man.  And in spite of a scary opening narration by Charlton Heston, this is not the end of times, just another gigantic asteroid on a collision course with Earth flick.<br />This movie is both frustrating and fun.  On one hand, the lack of reality is alarming, on the other hand, it's a frantic action packed thrill ride of destruction (both Shanghai and Paris are wiped in between a few comic bits!).  The high body count is implied but never dealt with.  The salvation of the world rests in the hands of a bunch of over-aged juvenile delinquents.  They're not fully developed characters; they're nonstop comic relief.  Everything about this movie is highly manufactured purely for effect.  A lot of shortcuts are taken to push the right emotional buttons.  And while everyone is at the height of cavalier distain, up pops some military subterfuge in a sneaky attempt to blow up the asteroid from without rather than from within, negating the need to place a lot of yahoos on the darn thing in the first place!  Everything about this movie is utterly preposterous.  It's an insult to common sense.  It's a chain reaction of impossibilities and momentum, nothing about it should work.<br /><br />And this is the part where I say I absolutely love this wreck of a movie anyway.  It's junk food for the senses, a barrage of fancy technology placed in the right order.  The world is on the brink of annihilation but thanks to Bruce Willis, calamity is narrowly averted at the very last minute!  Yea!<br /><br />It's corny, it's dumb, it's bereft of any artistic merit, but I do love to watch it every few years.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like mlp as a 20 year old pegasister and I work full time as a waitress. With my little tips. Even I can afford this game I don't know why everyone else is complaining. I've only spent maybe $10 (20 if I'm overestimating to be on the safe side.) And I have all six of the main ponies. It didn't take me years either I've only been a t the game for about a month. It's great for the kindle screen and I've had  very few glitches.the thing where when you launch the game and don't flip the screen sideways in time is the most annoying glitch cause your stuck with half a screen and no room to move around. The only other bad thing is the hearts currency. If it can only be gained by adding a lot of friends they should make it easier to find some other than Facebook cause I'm really the only brony I know. Other than these minor things.it's overall enjoyable and I find myself checking my ponies every night before bed and after breakfast every morning. I play it more than my other apps at least! Good job gameloft!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I had just started  reading The Last Man when I learned of Mr. Flynn's passing.<br />I have to believe the passages in the book that describe Stan Hurley's matter-of-fact attitude towards his own diagnosis of having six months to live due to cancer reflected the author's mind as he dealt with a similar fate.<br />I have read all of Mr. Flynn's  books and The Last Man does not disappoint, with the exception that it is too short.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book is a farce!  I am disgusted with the decision the author/publisher has made to stretch this out for more money.  I returned the book immediately.  What a shame, the first two books were really enjoyable but Sylvia Day sold out and got greedy.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed books one and two, in fact, loved them. This was a disappointment on so many levels. I kept having to put the book down because I was bored and the ending didn't wow me at all. I wish it had. :(
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great product, small price, and is sturdy and protective!<br />You want to show off your iPhone and keep it safe at the same time?<br />This is exactly what I was looking for!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good puzzle game. These rooms can actually be solved. Fun &amp; NOT extremely frustrating! Kept me interested. Finished the 1st 10 levels! Seems short, but promises to have more levels. Looking forward to more puzzle rooms.
0984334904|5.0|Lots of useful Kanji, with stroke order pictures and multiple definitions.  Definitely worth it if you're looking for more in depth Kanji study
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was amazing, just not long enough! Can't wait for the next room!! Please hurry! Can't wait to explore more of the room.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|This is an older cd but we still enjoy his music and this is no exception. Now we have his hits alone.
B002LU0E26|4.0|But I'd see it once.  I found it fun and a good nod toward the old movies.<br />It's cheesy at times, but forgivable.  None of the acting was terrible, some of it was rather good.<br />Watch it if you haven't seen it.<br />Don't expect to be wow'd by it, but watch it with some friends, and just enjoy it; You will.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like that it stores your previous calculations. Pretty good app. I would suggest it others and I'm going to continue yo use it whenever I get a chance.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I bought this after first seeing and hearing Susan Boyle on YouTube.  The album is a good first effort, and I will be buying more music from Miss Boyle in the future.  Item arrived as described and in a timely manner.  I would recommend this item for Susan Boyle fans. It will not disappoint.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Challenging, yet fun.  I wish there were more suits to choose from.  The big boy suit from the movie would be fun.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|i was able to download photos from my pc to my kindle so easily. very happy! Would recommend to any kindle fire owner.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|the series gets better than the previous movies gotta own this movie if you don't than you are not a transformers fan.
B000VSQ17M|5.0|Before people started to be hipster cool and make music that speaks to the soul, Jose Gonzalez did just that but before it became a &#34;thing&#34;
B0043UB0EI|4.0|This is a great series, but sound quality was low to poor. I recommend buying the series on DVD or Blue Ray
B003DNH6DK|4.0|This item arrived quickly, and since I have seen this movie multiple times, I knew it was good.  I simply wanted to add this to my DVD collection.  I am happy with it, and would recommend this movie for anyone who is looking for a &#34;feel-good&#34; movie based on a true story.
1401238580|4.0|This was a great gift for those who love the series. The graphic novel is great book for any collector. I actually just got it for the mask. The mask is actually more comfortable than the other masks out there. It is meant for taller faces though. I fit it quite well for large faces but my girlfriend looks odd with it on. Thats my 2 cents.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I am enjoying watching this DVD. It is a new way of telling a old fairy tales and making them more exciting! Product arrived on time in in excellent condition!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A thoughtful read.  Makes one stop and THINK!,,  this book can change one,s life if one is brave enough yo open one,s mind and heart to it.
B009VB97EY|3.0|If you just want pieces of meat to stare at for about an hour and a half watch this. Otherwise you can just google or youtube smale strippers for the same time for half the price.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Nothing like the movie. A truly amazing story by such a wonderful author. Please read with an open mind. It's not like the movie at all.
B008220DGE|5.0|A rich and complex character study of a broken man. Never quite reaches the brilliance of \\"There Will Be Blood\\", but it remains fascinating and impeccably acted throughout. The Master will haunt you long after you watch it. I can't wait for a second viewing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun, though sometimes I do find that the tasks necessary to complete the levels are not very intuitive.
B009S1FTVW|5.0|Almost textbook neo-classical metal. The crunchy distorted guitars add to the more twisted themes of songs like 'Pharaoh' and 'Of Sins and Shadows'.<br />'The Witching Hour' has a tone very similar to Yngwie Malmsteen's more precision oriented works.<br />'Pharaoh' has a very strong chorus created by the distorted vocals.<br />Throughout the album the bass can be heard due to its precise tone. It is features on 'Sea of lies'.<br />The cover track starts out with a slow choral arrangement but then quickly speeds up into a reference to Mars by Holst! The guitar tone there is absolutely sinister and their slight changes to the famous rhythm are totally acceptable. From there, speedy keyboard and guitar solos are introduced.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything about this series (and specifically, this blue-ray package) - is AAA Blockbuster quality. The acting, the scenery, the camera-work - and just the overall feel - is fantastic. I got it for my mom, but found that I couldn't step out of the room when it was on!
B000MDDSB8|3.0|Not the best acting in the world but if you are into the land of twenty year olds acting like 15 year olds this is the movie for you.
B005OYZ7Y6|4.0|Really fun and interesting book. I bought it because it wen around NY, which was my main interest, but i really liked the caracters and development of this weird day. Probably will check other books from Don DeLillo.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|This latest Nick Cave album has given me great joy.  It was a pleasure to get it so quickly and reasonably from Amazon.
B001JNNDEW|4.0|Classic movie. Had to pick it up on Blu-ray. Love the special edition. Would recommend to any fan of the movie.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|funny but predictable. Good movie, but glad I didn't spend the money and go see this in a movie theatre.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I'm a big Daft Punk fan, and although I like the album, it might be my least favorite DP album to-date. Not that it's bad, just a little slow for my liking.<br /><br />I wasn't crazy about the change of direction (in terms of the disco-y feel) - I much preferred the orchestral direction they took with the Tron soundtrack, or the classic DP sounds of Homework/Human After All...
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Bang Bang!!! Guns, Sex, and Drugs. Basically what every wants in life minus the guns. Savages is a great movie with hot sex, pot and great acting. this cast rocks.
B008EKON56|1.0|It worked great for a month of really light use. Then my iPhone 4S would play for 30 seconds then stop. I would press play again and it would stop in 30 or so seconds. The vicious play and stop cycle never breaking. My first suspicion was a loose connection to the phone, but everything was nice and snug and would not move on its own. I suspected the movement of the car, so I hooked it up to my stereo at home. Same thing happened. The same problem occurred when using a iPhone 4 and a nano 6g.<br /><br />Unfortunately I am to late to return it, and I am hesitant to order another one. Maybe it is my bad luck, or maybe it is just a flawed product.
B001AW156U|5.0|EXCELLENT!!!! only asked the Pelican PS3 Dual, as described in the picture but I thank the seller for sending the set of silicone caps as a bonus =) was very happy with this surprise, thank you! now my PS3 controller is complete
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|I first discovered Scale The Summit when it was announced that they would be a part of the first Prog Nation tour. I downloaded \\"Bloom,\\" the first track off of their second album, Carving Desert Canyons, to check them out. I wasn't really paying attention when it came on, then boom. I was blown away. Soaring melodies, rich guitar tones, tight bass and drums; I was hooked. (Warning: I'm kind of a fanboy.)<br />The Migration, their latest set, is admittedly not much of a departure from the style of their previous releases. This is not at all a bad thing; I'm a huge fan of their melodic instrumental \\"adventure metal.\\" This disc was produced by the band and Jamie King, and tonally it is a step up from their last disc, The Collective. Although made up of blazing players, STS never relies on shredding for shredding's sake. They have a strong melodic sense, and it carries through all the tracks on the album.<br />I can't recommend The Migration highly enough. Fantastic instrumentals, flawless performances, and no annoying vocals.<br />- See more at: http://bradbaileymusic.com/blog/brad_reviews_stuff_episode_1_scale_the_summit_the_migration/#sthash.0ZgoDeyK.dpuf
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I bought the hardback version over 20 years ago as I'm an great Conan Doyle fan.<br />Having the Kindle version has made rereading these stories absolutely a joy!<br />The purchase price was such a treat too!!<br /><br />I would love to see all of Agatha Christie in a volume like this for Kindle.
B007XF4J70|5.0|I very much enjoy the classic films put on bluray.  Bogey and Bacall... makes for good alone time with your special one. I recommend this for anyone who loves classic movies.
B00005JOHC|5.0|DELIVERY WAS ON TIME, THE SHOW MAKES ME HAPPY. I JUST WISH I HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY MORE, THAT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOW. IF YOU HAVE SALES ON THE REST PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I have always loved Dan Brown`s books. As always Brown delivered with a Great Book that will keep you guessing with every page you turn learning more and more about this political scandal.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Sweet, predictable romance, with some caricatures of bipolar and other mental illness thrown in.  Good acting in the parents, enjoyable story.  A little upsetting at times.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|The movie stopped three to four times.  The quality of the picture was out of focus and very difficult to see.  We have never had such a poor quality of film before. The movie was good, however the poor quality distracted greatly from it.
B0014YPEI4|1.0|My son loves dinosaurs and he had me to order two dinosaurs before this none.  He was really impressed wit<br />The size and so was I.  That is why I was really dissatisfied with this dinosaur.  I paid 18 dollars for a dinosaur<br />That looks like I would have done better at targetwit
B005DJREJS|2.0|this show's writers make the parents much more immature than the teenagers who are portrayed as the only 'adults' around. I watched 7 episodes  because I really identified w/some of the kids but the lame parents finally got to me.<br /><br />I'd had enough. Of course, YMMV.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying this series...missed it during it's initial release as we had gone without cable for about 5 years to help my daughter get moving instead of being a couch potato..lol.  The strategy worked and she prefers outside activities instead of inside.  Now I get to catch up on all the TV I missed those years and this is a series that I am thoroughly enjoying!
B000KIRT6A|4.0|I have a acoustic pickup that has a relatively low output level. It has been adequate until I started playing in one situation that had very little volume boosting capability in the sound system setup. This equalizer has a preamp that has raised the volume of my pickup to allow the sound levels on the sound system. Plus I can customize the equalization to my liking.
B00B1ME3DQ|3.0|Its Clutch, so it is very rocking. Lots of groovy bass and cool blues riffs, but definately not their best work. You may have noticed that over the last few years Clutch has started writing less about life and telling stories, and just pretty much have been saying how hard they rock over and over. I call this Def Leppard syndrome. Still very cool, alot of great driving music, but don't expect anything as deep and interesting as Blast Tyrant or Pure Rock Fury.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is the best VILLAGE game ever my opinion.you feed animals get money and it goes with the storyline of the movie.
B0083Z614S|5.0|The movie CD was a gift from a friend . Very Special.  Ordered the book, It was better. I already owned +Sarah Crewe+ by the same Author and am looking forward to reading her +Little Lord Fontleroy+. Have recomended all to my daughters, grand daughter and three teenager great grand daughters.  THE Secret Garden.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Needs to be watched twice or perhaps the book read. The acting is strong and though long, seems to go by quickly.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Ok so here is the trouble with this game,, I played it everyday from 25/Dec 2012, I was at level 49 heading for level 50,so then, there was a download, then I couldn't load game up,when it did load up I was back at level 1,as you can imagine I wasn't happy..I contacted gameloft,wrote my first ratings...NOW I'm writing my 2nd as this is happening again,,yesterday 21/6/13 my game wouldn't load up and still won't load up today.At present I'm level 21, the game screen says veryfing files then it goes off and back to kindle main screen.I contact gameloft and as yet still waiting for a reply...if and when this game loads up if it states level 1,I don't think I could 're play for a 3rd time..such a shame this game has issues at this magnitude,with little or no response from gameloft this game can and will only get bad reviews....So if your going through the ratings to see if you should download the game THINK before you do,,I'm PLAYING 2ND TIME ROUND AFTER ISSUES...AT PRESENT I'M NOT PLAYING DUE TO IN GAME ISSUES...I WOULD SAY DON'T DOWNLOAD ITS NOT WORTH THE ISSUES,YOU ARE GOING TO ENCOUNTER WITH IT.......
0385344228|5.0|This was one of those books I loved so much I looked up the author after because I was hoping he had written 10 more book in similar style to this one that I had never heard of so I could go read them all. I empathized with the characters and wanted to believe or not believe just like them. I have recommended it to to a few people and they have all loved it too. It is basically about a boy who is accused of something terrible, his parents belief in his innocence, and and includes the court case that ensues and the neighborhood response. But believe me it's not like anything you've read before. I definitely recommend!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I saw someone get eaten by a pack of dogs, someone get his nuts shot off, and a guy have his eyes pulled out. Nothing too out of the ordinary for a Tarantino movie, but its definately a hard one to watch with your grandma. Nevertheless, this movie is fantastic, one of the best Quentin has ever done. Its Pulp Fiction good, no joke. All the actors are perfect for their roles, the story is a little cliche but is retold in a very new and interesting way, and the score and camera work are spot on. If you are a fan of his work, and are watching on an empty stomach, you will find this to be one of the best movies of the year, maybe the decade.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have been playing bingo for months now and started having problems with purchases And receiving coins or bingo chips when I should if I didn't have those problems it would be perfect
B008602KQI|3.0|It was a decent movie. Books are always better because it leaves it up to YOUR imagination, but...still a better love story than twilight... ;)
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|Yeezus is not bad... but is far from the level of his previous albums. It has 3 o 4 great songs but the rest is average. Plus the physical release is awful... ten dollars and no boolet, no artwork.... there's no difference between downloading and buying the cd.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Ture, this damn thing has its name right! As the name implies \\"thunderbolt\\" the speed is extremely fast. Made downloading times a breeze. I downloaded gigabytes of information really very quickly (of course the major factor is your ISP speed subscription).<br /><br />This item does not require a genius to use, so I won't bother explain how to use it. Hence they even provided an image as a reference for usage.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all who have Macs with thunderbolt ports.

B008S4YZCO|4.0|This game is very fun!!! You get to take care of your very own cute monster! The monsters are not scary at all. Appropriate for ages 6and up. This game is a blast!! I totally love and recommend it.

B00004Y87O|5.0|This movie is about a future prison using Manhattan Island as a prison colony. This movie has an innovative idea of how to deal with career criminals.<br /><br />Instead of putting all these career criminals that get 25 to life into a prison where it cost $100,000 a year to imprison them, just put them on an islands and let them try to survive on their own by living off the land. Separate the men & women into 2 different islands so that they can not reproduce and create a bigger problem. Have a small crew to watch the island to make sure no one escape and that all you have to worry about.<br /><br />Those that did not get life can be release from the island when their time is up if they survive during their the time served and still alive, after verifying their finger prints & DNA.<br /><br />The movie is very innovative and imaginative.  But that is to be expect from John Carpenter.  He write the best and most imaginative movie base on real life.<br /><br />A must watch for anyone who is a John Carpenter fan.<br /><br />Note: For more details about Penal Colonies, go to the following Wikipedia link  [...]

B00026WU9Q|5.0|With \\"Bringing it All Back Home\\" from 1965 Bob Dylan changed limits for when music should be called pop, folk, beat or blues. After releasing four excellent acoustic albums filled with clever original songs,  Dylan here took the step into electric music, by allowing one side of the album to be accompanied by electric guitars, bass and drums.<br /><br />Five of these songs were basically 12 bar blues with raw unpolished electric accompaniment. Among these \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" and \\"Maggie's Farm\\" have become classics of the period, while \\"She Belongs to Me\\" and \\"Love Minus Zero / No Limit\\" are two of the most beautiful love songs Dylan has ever released. Both are available in numerous cover versions - Rick Nelson has for example brilliantly interpreted both songs.<br /><br />On side two of the original album, Dylan is back in his usual music approach with his acoustic guitar, harmonica and his own characteristic vocals. Lyrically, however, Dylan has moved himself,  towards the more surreal and refined. Also here we have some of his greatest classics like \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" two songs which The Byrds superbly chose to interpret.<br /><br />In short, this is an album that set new standards for modern music and an album all music lovers deserve to hear.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good acting, entertaining story.  I just wish there were an Amazon Prime APP for my 2011 series Samsung TV and/or DVD players.  Can you help make this app happen?
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is great. But every time I just went in the game, it shows all the goals I have all ready completed. It takes about 10EE minutes to show all of my goals. Great but stupid.
B00BCSBU4E|5.0|This compact box of 55 discs is fully packed with music. Many discs are filled to 75 minutes or more with related material. It is an amazing bargain and an entertaining collection. Highly recommended.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|Great album. Reminds me a little of the Beatles in their psychedelic period. He even sounds a little like Lennon.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think it is a very fun game but it will crash a lot on Kindle Fire HD.Thank You!<br /><br />NOOBS stop playing minecraft please
B004MKLRYC|5.0|A delightfully funny satire that all readers will appreciate, especially those who came to love reading later in life. I wonder if Queen Elizabeth has read it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This was an awesome game and also very interesting for kids and adults. It is a awesome game relating from the movie it's like your actually there.
B008602KQI|4.0|Not as good as the book, but entertaining none the less. Lawrence is a talented actress. I'm awaiting the next two movies with anticipation.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|This was better than the first FB app I got but there are still some games I can't get to work properly. High 5 Casino will start to load but won't actually get to play the slot machines. Otherwise this is a good app.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo Blitz is probably my favorite game to play on my Kindle Fire. I do believe I'm a Bingo addict. Lol the only negative thing about it is it freezes too many times.  When points are taken & the game freezes, sometimes they are not reimbursed.
1608871819|3.0|From my much longer review, originally published on EntertaintmentTell:<br /><br />Man of Steel: Inside the Legendary World of Superman tries its best to strike a balance between \\"art of\\" and \\"making of,\\" but at a scant 184 pages (and it honestly doesn't even seem that long), it doesn't really have room to be either of those things to a satisfying degree. As a \\"making of,\\" it does touch on some really interesting points in the text--especially when it comes to the filmmakers' collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense to create an accurate portrayal of the military in the film, as well as many of the thoughts that went into the design of Krypton--and there is a positively fascinating page on the development of the Kryptonian language developed for the film. But much of what is delivered in the book in that regard just leaves me hungry for more. If anything, it's an intriguing tease.<br /><br />As an \\"art of,\\" though, the book is an all-around disappointment. There are so many elements of the text that could have been given so much more weight with the right images: the discussion of the design of the S-emblem comes to mind, as well as the design of the suit as a whole. But alas, we don't get a single solitary image of any of the iterations that the S-glyph must have certainly gone through. And any paintings of the Big Blue suit pretty much mirror the final design in the film to a tee.<br /><br />Perhaps the most frustrating thing about Man of Steel: Inside the Legendary World of Superman, though, is that if you're a fan of the film hungry for a deeper look, the book is kind of essential. Not very satisfying, mind you, but there are several really neat tidbits and insights here that I'll admit make it worth owning. If, and only if, you're a hardcore fan. (Although, let's face it: if you're a hardcore fan you probably pre-ordered the book long before I ever thought about writing this review.)<br /><br />It's just a shame that there isn't a proper Art of Man of Steel book in the works, nor a truly in-depth Making of. Because I would happily pay good money for both of those books (preferably the former). The only real hope at this point for those of us who geek out on pre-production artwork is that the Blu-ray release might include so many of the early and unused concepts that this book unfortunately, for the most part, ignoresSteel book in the works, nor a truly in-depth Making of.

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Absolutely loved the characters and actually felt sorry for Darcy when she found out what people really thought of her.  I cheered her on when she went through her self improvement!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Simple enough and the rooms are entertaining. Looking forward to more rooms an  hopefully a few more challenging. Either way, great way to think and work on puzzles
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a must see for everyone.  It makes you want to be a better person and to be be a part of something better.

B00407PNY2|5.0|WENT TO SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN IN 1968 WITH MY BIG BROTHER (REST IN PEACE BRO ).THIS MOVIE GOT ME INTO MUSCLE CARS , HAVE COLECTION I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE !!!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I've come to think of Warm Bodies as an off-beat romantic comedy.  R's (Nicholas Hoult) inner (quite articulate) monologues are what make the film; his embodied experience as a zombie is at odds with mental and emotional desire for connectedness with those around him.  He collects remnants of a lost humanity and uses music to express his emotions.  As his relationship with Julie (Teresa Palmer) grows, R re-discovers the joys, fears, and awkwardness (&#34;Don't be creepy, don't be creepy!&#34;) of new love.  In so many ways, their journey encapsulates how so many of us feel when we meet someone who appreciates our own brand of weird.  It's a fun movie with a few good jokes, some minor gross-outs, and a happy ending.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Awesome game! Just wish I didn't go through my bingo chips so fast. My fault though. Very addictive and super fun!
B00BTHWFEC|3.0|When Black Sabbath burst on the scene in 1970 they were definitely unique for their time as their first three albums would prove. They helped define the sound and style of Heavy Metal that has been well emulated to this day! I was apprehensive about \\"13\\" as their hasn't been an Ozzy era Sabbath album since the lackluster \\"Never Say Die\\" and expectations would be high.. I can honestly say I am pleasantly surprised.. While not on par with those early albums the classic Sabbath sound and style is evident right from End of the Beginning to the final notes of Dear Father complete with the classic rain and tolling bells...Zeitgeist is my personal favorite as it has a Planet Caravan feel but with a modern take that this fan of space/sci fi loves... The band sounds good and a special hats off to Tony as his guitar playing is as inspired as ever considering he is battling cancer. If you love Black Sabbath from 1970-75 this will work just fine for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Finally a different type of game with new type of challenge.  I am addicted and look forward to next levels.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very good game. People need to remember that it is just a game.....just sit back and play some bingo. So have some fun with it
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very accurate with lots of options.  Have other weather apps, but I always come back to this one.  This app seems to be the most accurate of all available.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I liked this because I am a big fan of the show, and love being able to go back and see all the episodes in order.
B001K3EXTA|2.0|Pretty dull overall and badly acted and badly written. Very silly dialog. Nice cinematography. Makes me glad that I am not rich if the lifestyle is anything like that portrayed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|AWESOME GAME I LOVE IT IT IS FUN AND HARD AT THE SAME TIME. THIS IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Where is the free game come from when you get to the really good part of the game you have to start buying stuff in order to keep going forward? Instead of saying free you should say it is a demo instead of free.

B00AKO93JK|5.0|Really good app has a gym of exercises available and can help you get started on a healthy life style.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|When I read this book, I remembered Jr. High school myself. I know it`s kind of \\"young adult`ish\\" but it was ALL kinds of entertaining. I would recommend this book for ANYONE who wants to experience their teenage life.
B000E1ZK5A|5.0|Good war movie. Same movie as blu ray and DVD editions. If you have HD DVD this is a good movie. Not the greatest though. I would preferred Battle of Britain sadly it's not on HD DVD.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|A gift, this CD made my teen happy to own. Came shipped as expected and there were no problems with the actual cd.
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|It wants my location to push ads that are relevant to my area. Ok. I get that. Still I don't necessarily like that. One star gone. Unlike all these other &quot;thick skulled&quot; people complaining about it though, I'm smart enough to turn my location off. Problem solved :)<br />Person with education, 1.<br />Other people who just want to be negative, 0.<br /><br />Now. The game downloaded quickly and plays smoothly on my S4 so no issues with the UI on this device.<br /><br />The gameplay is logical and its very entertaining, however it does get rather repetitive and boring so one star goes.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I knew about most of the items in this book, but there are ALWAYS tips to learn from. I received this for free after self-publishing on CreateSpace. If you plan on self-publishing, get this book
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a match 3 game like Big Kahuna Reef or Bejeweled.  You clear screens to earn bricks to rebuild the town around the tree of life.  The graphics are beautiful and the power-ups are inventive.  I found myself unable to stop playing.  I kept promising myself &quot;just one more screen&quot;.  There is a timed mode and a Zen mode for those who want to relax without a time limit.  I think this is one of the best match 3 games for android.
0062255657|5.0|amazing is all I can say. read it in one sitting. beautiful and frightening and sad. I very much enjoyed this
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I ordered this product for my child and she was vey happy with this movie which is her favorite movie so it made me happy! Thanks

B003IWRE3I|5.0|If you have not already done so, you need to see this film [[ASIN:B003IWRE3I The Road]] It is an absolute masterpiece! If you still believe that a government that wages needless wars, kills innocent people without due process, spies on it's own citizens and no longer represents its people gives a DAMN about you then you have GOT to see this film!<br />I hope and pray that you will watch it and it will OPEN your eyes to what could happen if things continue as they are!!!<br />May God Bless You My Dear Friends!!!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Daughter likes<br />Now that is hard to do still don't understand it myself but it works<br />Maybe it's just keeping her busy though just so long as she's happy
B003EVWDR0|1.0|I didn't want to purchase a digital download of this movie but wanted the actual DVD/BlueRay discs to purchase!! The one click option is ok if it is just that an OPTION!  Not the ONLY option!  I tried to return the item and there is NO Return contact information ANYWHERE that you can find! Seems Amazon.com likes the money coming in but not a HELP Option for issues as this!  Want a refund for the purchase from Amazon.com and want to purchase the actual DVD/Blue Ray discs!!

078322947X|5.0|I first bought the soundtrack, &#34;Sorcerer&#34; in 1978, and loved it. But I NEVER saw the movie . I FINALLY bought it, and watched it.  WOW, What a Intense Movie!!! I was on the edge of My seat from minute 1 !!! After 35 Years, I again, Finally got to enjoy this Great Movie!!! I Highly Recommend this Great Movie!! 5 Stars!!!
B0055S348W|1.0|This app updates every few days. Very annoying. It works great but are there really that many updates really necessary?

B004GYY714|5.0|Great app, it works and has many many radio stations to choose from.  I really like that i can listen to radio stations abroad
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|These id10t &quot;developers&quot; think we're stupid?  We are not walking location targets. I will NEVER allow this junk on my phones with these permissions. People have questioned the GPS requirements but why do they need course location by phone and WiFi networks too?  This spyware has zero true need for any location whatsoever. Demand better from the apps you install.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Love the unit but don't know why they put the camera on the same side as the screen. Makes photos a little tricky. Don't like that there is no indicator light on the charger. So far so good. Lots to learn yet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A Very fun and challenging app! A great brain tease.  Waiting for more levels to come out soon... I hope very soon
B00COHAUD4|3.0|There are a lot of NEGATIVE reviews. I think they are overstating their case -- well, more like understating it, since they all seem to be one-liners. Anyway, the movie certainly warrants more than 1 or 2 stars. I think it is entertaining. The acting was very good. The direction was nice and so was the production.<br /><br />There are a lot of things you simply have to ignore in order to appreciate the movie- as is the case with a lot of supernatural/horror films. These elements include: no one can survive in the woods for 5 years, even with \\"Mama\\"; the youngest girl was portrayed as too animalistic; the oldest girl has quite a large vocabulary; the shrink is not credible; from coma to driving (!).<br /><br />The biggest problem was with the resolution. The film morphs into a \\"Lifetime Movie,\\" with a woman investigating dangerous occurrences on her own and trying to protect her \\"daughters.\\" And the very end will disappoint many viewers. They tried too hard to stick with a particular theme that mimics history, and they do so unnecessarily. This is not for people who like neat and just endings.<br /><br />One final thing: there were some great moments of symbolism in the film, and I especially loved the drawings of the oldest girl. Overall - entertaining, with several flaws. Just overlook them, if you can.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I try to get the game but it aways says I. have to many games but I can download other games with no prob
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Beautiful, lyrical prose.  Hosseini has an incredible knack for clarity, for bringing every detail sharply into focus.  A must read.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|How sad. This looks like a fun app. With sleazy permissions like that I wouldn't play it for free. Uninstalled.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I saw this  game on YouTube and I got it now I have it on Xbox pc and pe it is great! And I think everyone should try it. I like that you can do anything<br />But I don't like trolls my classmate was trolled at a middle school
160059672X|4.0|Beautiful book with very clear instructions and wonderful photographs! Even if you are not a beadwoker, leafing through it is a delight.
B0018RFLQ2|4.0|A very good movie for anyone who has kids that are involved in any competitive activity.  Great job of delving into how relationships are impacted by a young child's success and how difficult it is to walk the fine line between pushing your kid to be successful and pushing them too far.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|This gem of a song, with an almost a five minute professional<br />production, begins as seamlessly as it ends, making it<br />worth listening to again and again.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Disappointed in the last book.  It was no where as interesting as book 1 and 2.  Looks like the author was was filling out a three book agreement!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is really heartwarming...real....everything that you experience in life. I laughed cried and fell in love. Truly a great read.
B003QP2TYQ|5.0|I had already seen this movie series and loved it, which is why my husband bought it for me for Mother's Day. I have to say, it was even better the 2nd time around!!! BBC did a superb job with the cast and the entire production, and seeing it on blue ray improves anything! I love the story line, I love the actors, and I just loved the entire film altogether. Definitely worth the $. I would recommend it to anyone!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Few live music albums have the quality of sounding,<br />looking and FEELING good. With or without viewing<br />the enclosed (mature audience) DVD,  this album<br />grooves.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so realistic I miss my horses!<br />I always want to ride when I play. amazing game, fantastic work
0307476073|1.0|Don't waste your time.  While the descriptions of the PCT are indeed interesting, such descriptions drown in the sea of whinings by the author.  She survives the trail through sheer luck.  Her continuing acts of stupidity [heroin, why not chew an opium root with a total stranger, and sex with anything male] become painfully tedious such that, perhaps, we become more concerned about her boots, ski pole and Monster than about her.<br />A boring, painful, and unnecessary read.
1590171993|5.0|This is a very interesting storyline. The writing style is well done and made learning about the live of a young man's life as an English profession an enlighten experience.  The storyline is delightful to read without the current level of violence and sensationalism so often found with today's writer.  I appreciated learning about this book popularity through the one NPR report.  Thanks for heads up.
B008VVT51U|5.0|I loved this movie.  We all as we get older and are faced with health care costs and what social security gives us wonder how we are going to live. This movie shows you there is still more out thereto do and see and experience.
1781162646|4.0|I was delighted to see a new book by King, and although I am devoted to Kindle, and haven't read a bound book in a couple of years, I go along with King's instincts (big fan clearly).  I did enjoy the book, but I'd have loved it on Kndle.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|The book reminded me of Tolkien. The lands surrounding Everville made me think of Middle Earth. Everville reminded me of the Shire with the Fron in the role of the Hobbits. The Keepers reminded me of the wizards. There's also an epic battle with hideous creatures. This said, the story has it's own creativity and is not a ripoff of Tolkien.<br /><br />Some people may be turned off by the first person narration, but I thought it was fine. My only criticism would be the name of &#34;Them&#34; for the dark force. It set off the &#34;grammar police&#34; in my head each time I read it in a sentence.<br /><br />I think readers nine to seventeen will enjoy the story the most, but anyone can read it and enjoy it. I appreciate the fact the author used NO foul language or gratuitous violence. It's not the epic fantasy adventure of The Hobbit, but then again, I read that book is the 2nd best selling novel of all time. I think The First Pillar is fairly priced and is worth trying out.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|Front guns are removable, has a missile on top which can also be removed.<br />Wings on sides pop out.<br />A motorcycle comes out from the enclosure.<br />Batman is included.<br />Batman can be launched by pushing certain buttons, which my son loves, too.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My children love this game because they can create different objects or characters that makes the variations of the game endless. Additional levels can be purchased, and these levels can be very challenging to complete, so they have to be very creative with their created objects and characters.In addition, they can create their own background, which they can customize and decorate just as they can customize their favorite avatar. Parents beware: monitor the time the children spend on the game because it is addictive.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!Great amazing cool fun to play by you yourself you. Very creative and fun game especially if you know who everyone is.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Fun game, no brainer until you go higher. Still working on that. Enjoy as a light game to take your mind away.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cool game<br />it is made just right looking foward to new levels the best best best best game out there of its kind
B00C391Y3I|4.0|Dvd has a very good sound, and the band plays great. It's over 2 hours and 20 minutes with a great setlist. The film shifts around too much, which is annoying. They don't show Ian enough. Richie kicks ass. The only Halford scream that I think was edited was at the end of \\"Rapid Fire.\\" Rob hits the high notes better than he has since 2000. The problem is that he sings all the verses like he's singing the verses to \\"Beyond the Realms of Death.\\" He over dramatizes the vocals in songs like \\"Heading Out to the Highway\\" or \\"Green Manalishi.\\" His voice doesn't have the charisma that it used to have, and he sounds like he's in pain as he sings. He also seems to blurt out the lyrics too quickly. This dvd is better than \\"Rising in the East\\" and the \\"British Steel 30th Anniversary,\\" but it's not as good as \\"Priest Live\\" or \\"Live Vengeance '82.\\"
B009X01FJS|5.0|Love the color instead of the black. I think it's good quality  for the money.<br />I can set it up any way I want.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|A classic that everyone needs to read. The story is not boring and Steinbeck keeps the interest flowing throughout the book.
B000002KHF|5.0|i really like this album.  its a mix of folk, rock, and jazz.  its hard to catagorize vm into a specific genre but this is just good music.  There is a real emotional connection with this stuff.  Highly recommended.
B000000OQ5|3.0|I think this album is overrated. It has a few good songs on it, but the next three Tesla albums were better. There are some filler songs, and Jeff doesn't sign like he did on their later albums.
B007SGM084|5.0|I actually read the series about a year ago, the actual paperbacks. I bought the series for my kindle awhile ago. I guess I was holding off . I loved the series so much, I was thinking maybe I wouldn't enjoy it as much again- Hello!!! I WAS WRONG!!!! The sexual. Chemistry between Christian and Ana is palpable.. I loved the elevator when Christian shows his true self when he says \\" F--- the paperwork!!\\" I loved at the end of the last book that the author gave us Christian's Pov, I still hope EL James will finish the story thru his eyes but after reading the much anticipated \\"walking disaster\\"  Travis Pov was a disappointment. But a girl can dream. Let's face it most of us compare everything to this one series it was just that good...
0060919760|1.0|Excellent book. It is inspiring. It helps me a lot. I am happy that we have Chinese version in China.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I just saw this movie on the plane back from the US to Germany. I the film it is said that \\"some sons are born and some arrive...\\" If only people realized these moments existed and chose to give more love to children who for whatever reason have been left behind we would have a better world. This film is not a surf party it is an exploration of the evolving family dynamic in the US and all the challenges that lay before both the children and parents. I left the film promising to spend more time with my son and look to keep the door open to others that need a shoulder to lean on. Huge thanks to the creative minds behind this film!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a very addictive and fun puzzle game. just wish there were more levels. can't wait until the next update is released.
B001O1O71C|4.0|The consistent point of view from the boy, that of an innocent sweet child, combined with that same point of view of the Jewish boy rips the socks off the telling of this situation from any other viewpoint.  The sister's teen-age angst was admirably presented.  The pinnacle of the story, however, was the understated conclusion for the two little boys.  A remarkable telling of a slice of this horrible history.
B000FBJAF0|3.0|A potboiler. Enjoyable enough.<br />Fast paced, well constructed and kept you reading.  The journalistic style doesn't make for deep character evolution.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|If your speakers and/or amplification device support the use of banana plugs, I definitely recommend using these. Amazon has once again created a high-quality product at a good price. These banana plugs feature black and red rings which make it easy to keep track of the polarity of the speaker wires. With 16 AWG or thinner speaker wires, I had to remove the colored rings to get a secure connection, but that was a minor inconvenience. If you use speaker wire thicker than 16 AWG, I don't think you'll have this issue.<br /><br />The packaging of this item is easy to open and neatly stores any extra plugs you don't immediately use.
B00000AFGM|4.0|I got this to replace my original copy (cassette tape lol). I loved it then, and while my musical tastes have changed somewhat, coming back and listening to it brought back memories.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great novels, still a bit better than the HBO series: more details, more stories, not too much explicit sexuality and more plots...
B004SEUIXS|5.0|This is a great feel-good movie. This movie captures a French girl who is a dreamer making a difference in the world around her and falling in love. It's very playful, very sweet, and is definitely worth watching
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great game but that's just my opinion on the game; some have different but that is it.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I loved this album when I was in high school, and it is no different now.  Marilyn Manson defined rock for me so I was happy to see that I could replace my old copy.
0375842209|5.0|Although it has not been read yet, it is on the high school required reading list. We saw this at a book store for $13.99 but held off to check Amazon's price. Got it brand new on Amazon for almost half the price of the book store!
B003VB5E2E|5.0|As usual EC's guitar guest put on great performances. The Crossroads Festivals, including this 2010 event, are excellent for listening to & watching new & veteran guitarists.
0345803485|3.0|Interesting story but it lost its flavor towards the end when it just became a romantic love story.  The kinky stuff started out strong but left me wanting a little more.  Maybe it is just me but not enough filth in this book to make it the &#34;craze&#34; everyone was raving about.  You get better stories in penthouse forum.  Ok book but wouldn't bother with the trilogy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Seeming disconnects early in the reading all come together. Hosseine did it again.  Although different from his early books, this is a deeply moving story
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is really good if you like farm games this the game for you it is fun and the characters are cute and it based on the old west when people had to build there own building s and grow there own food and milk there  cows
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I've been trying to read classic novels lately, and &#34;The Picture of Dorian Gray&#34; came highly recommended. I loved it and I wish that I  had read the book a long time ago. Watching the evolution of Dorian Gray's character kept me engaged throughout the whole book. Following his development from an innocent, child-like being into a callous, murderous monster opened the door for intellectual discourse on philosophies on beauty, youth, and the soul between the main characters that I really appreciated.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|Hilarious rented it twice kept me laughing through the whole thing. Recommend this to everyone . Great cast very very funny
B003XT603Q|4.0|I think this will be a book that I will reflect on over time, nota book that instantly reveals itself to the reader. Yet murakam's writing is seemingly transparent. The characters are relatable, yet also kooky. I enjoyed the novel but had trouble getting into it, it took me about 100pages to really become invested.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|A classic... Timeless... It's so nice to have the Kindle edition! Makes reading in bed so easy! Now I'm on to Sense and Sensibility.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is an awesome. brain teaser. looking forward to an update. poke that you have to find different things. great job!
B008VBYN80|3.0|The energy storage needs to be larger.  I would like the format or map itself to be larger without having to magnify.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am almost finished with it. I am up to day 24. I love it. it is amazing workout. I have lost weight with it along with doing my other exercises too. I would recoomended this to all my friends
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I love supernatural.  I would probably give it a #5 rating as long as it is going!<br />I would recommend it to anyone that can think out of the box!
