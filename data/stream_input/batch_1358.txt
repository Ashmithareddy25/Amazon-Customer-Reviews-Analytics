B0067Q42BY|4.0|Nice mah jong-type game with beautiful graphics, engaging story, and pleasant sounds and music. Gameplay is simple with plentiful hints and increasing difficulty.<br /><br />Not sure what all the griping about ads is -- I saw only one screen describing other games. Really not that intrusive, guys.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Very fun game. It's well designed and fun to play. If I had a poodle, I would still play it. I would still play it if I has a llama, too. The only reason why I would stop playing it is if I owned a rabid walrus...then it may be difficult to play.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|its fun and a little aditing. i like the sawnd efxects,and the pics are ez to pick out. im happy i cud dawnlode it for free today or i wudint have gotin to play it.
0307472590|5.0|This book is just darn right good.  Good literature.  I will be looking for more novels by this author.  I am reading spanish novels to work on my spanish, and I didn't have a hard time getting through this book, although a dictionary always helps at times.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|I love Doctor Who!!! Especially David Tennant (10th Doctor) So, of course, I bought the 10th Doctors sonic screwdriver. I would rate this at definetly 5 stars. I love it. The sound is realistic, the light is realistic, and it is very durable. It comes in a hard to open package, with 3 batteries included and of course instructions and a very handsome picture of David Tennant. But, if you are looking for a sonic that actually works, I would try somewhere else. My DVD player was having some problems, so I soniced it and...nothing. But I did get a good feeling like I actually did something useful, so it's satifactory. So far, I have had very little troubles and it is easy set up and extremely simple to use. Literally as easy as pushing a button. It also includes an invisible ink pen (very fun) and a regular pen (not as much fun) that easily fasten on to the end of the screwdriver.    P.S: You will need a small screwdriver to unscrew the slot where the batteries are installed
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I gust started to play and then it froze. For 3or 4 not minutes but hours. I dident want it to happen any more or to get a vruis. So I tried to get rid of it but it wouldent go away. I'm even having trouble tipeng this review right now.
B004WDRTHS|5.0|One of the best Disney movies ever! I grew up with this movie so I made it a point to have this on Blu-Ray to keep forever (if technology allows) and hopefully share it with my future kids. Great quality and love the special features.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is a very complex story that on the surface is about some very human superheroes.  These superheroes have retired thanks to the Keene Act that was passed by our government.  When one of their own is found murdered, Rorschach, who has continued to fight crime despite the Keene Act, takes it upon himself to investigate the murder.  He finds signs that lead him to believe this murder will not be an isolated incident and warns his retired comrades while he continues his investigation.<br /><br />Watchmen is amazing.  Not only is it amazing as far as graphic novels go, it's better and more intelligently written than a lot of lauded literature that I've read.  Each section of the story is told from the point of view of a different character.  Each character thinks differently, so you get the story from several different perspectives.  In doing this, you begin to see that there is no clear right or wrong.  What's right from one character's perspective is wrong from another character's perspective.  You learn that not everything is black and white.  There are shades of gray and lots of them.  This is a book about government and politics; this is a book about philosophy; this is a book about science; but most of all, this is a book about humanity, its flaws, and its beauty.  I've never read anything like this before and it will stay with me for a very long time.
0385534639|3.0|Given the excellent reviews, I thought I would love this book.  The author creates a unique circus with incredible imagery, but despite that it is flat. While the book made me feel the wonder of this circus, the characters didn't make me feel anything.  When the main characters, Marco and Celia, face their biggest obstacle, I didn't feel the love they supposedly had or the passion.  However, I could describe their clothes and how they looked.  I don't feel like I was let in on how they felt.  They didn't seem real with the perfect angel Celia and the mysterious Marco.
B005ZUR724|5.0|A lot of work went into this game,very well done! it seems to run nicely on the Kindle Fire. Top notch MMO that takes just a bit getting used to the controls but it is so much fun. And you can not beat the monthly price.!

B005K2YRVG|4.0|This case for a Kindle ebook reader does the job of protecting the reader very well.  It is a bit expensive, costing almost half as much as the reader itself. Many patterns for home sewing a similar case are available and serve the purpose as well.  Other than price, I can highly recommend this case.
0143039881|4.0|Six million Jews were killed as a result of one man's evil vision. That man, Adolf Hitler, committed suicide before he was brought to trial. This left a void. Someone needed to pay, and that became Otto Adolf Eichmann, who stood trial in Israel in 1961 for crimes against humanity. \\"The prosecution gave substance to the chief argument against the trial, that it was established not in order to satisfy the demands of justice, but to still the victims' desire for and, perhaps, right to vengeance\\" writes Hannah Arendt in her 1963 review of the trial, which was held entirely in Hebrew, even though the defendant and his counsel only spoke German.<br /><br />Adolf Eichmann was a mid-level bureaucrat in the Nazi regime. He was assigned the role of Jewish deportations, which in his mind meant arranging for passports, traveling to Israel to clear transit problems, and mapping out train schedules. He was an uneducated cog in the massive wheel of \\"progress\\" in Germany. It clearly points out the importance of believing in the job you've been assigned, and not being afraid to stand up to your superiors when you don't approve of their actions - something Eichmann never did. Of course, neither did the numerous Jewish leaders with whom he worked closely seem to question what was happening. Everyone just went along with the giant bureaucratic machine which eventually rolled over a whole generation of people.<br /><br />Eichmann was tried for crimes against humanity. Arendt successfully - I believe - argues that he was not guilty of this. \\"For just as a murderer is prosecuted because he has violated the law of the community, and not because he has deprived the Smith family of its husband, father, and breadwinner, so these modern state-employed mass murderers must be prosecuted because they violated the order of mankind, and not because they killed millions of people.\\" Eichmann did not violate the law of his community, on the contrary. He followed it without question, and for this he was hung.<br /><br />Do not think that I somehow am sympathetic to Eichmann's case. He was tried and found guilty by a court out to prosecute someone, but he at no time made any attempt to protect himself, or the lives of the people he was sending to their deaths. He received a punishment fitting for his life's work, I just don't believe he was a 'criminal'. He could be you, he could be me. And that was Arendt's point. The Israeli trial did not bring justice. It brought more of the same.<br /><br />If you think the German Nazis were somehow unique, if you think it could never happen again - read this book. \\"It is in the very nature of things human that every act that has once made its appearance and has been recorded in the history of mankind stays with mankind as a potentiality long after its actuality has become a thing of the past. No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes. On the contrary, whatever the punishment, once a specific crime has appeared for the first time, its reappearance is more likely than its initial emergence could ever have been.\\"k that I somehow am sympathetic to Eichmann's case.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I forgot what albums were until this came out.  This is meant to be listened to all the way through... repeatedly.  I thought that I was the only one that thought that this got better with each listening... but then I read several reviews that said the same thing.  This is an album that could have come between Women and Children and Fair Warning.  I will not bemoan Michael Anthony's absence.  I love the guy, but whoever is playing bass was great.  Dave is on. Alex is tight. It is good to hear Eddie back on guitar.  Best songs: She's The Woman, You and Your Blues, Blood and Fire, As Is, Honeybabysweetitdoll , Stay Frosty,

B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great game... I can't believe people are complaining about ads, when I loaded this up I was expecting tons of ads... It's one screen where you can see the other games they have made and you click play then this game starts... I wouldn't even call it an ad, it's more like a launch screen. People need to grow up and stop whining about stupid stuff.

0062082353|5.0|I purchased this book, as a gift for my son,who is a former Marine. I wanted to give him a book that I thought would interest him, and I can say, after he read the book he told me,  he enjoyed it very much, and is happy to add it to his library.  So if you are undecided what to buy in this catagory, I would say you can't go wrong with American Sniper. A great gift, at a very reasonable price.

B006PHD0RW|3.0|Bag It! is a decent game, butas compared to others I found it to be simplistic. Not easy mind you, but rather without a lot of variance in a given round or by and among rounds. I now, however, have greater appreciation for grocery baggers of the world, a job I now know Id rather leave to them.
0307887960|1.0|I just wanted to say that Atkins is much more satisfying and I feel healthier on it.  I am diabetic and Atkins brought my blood sugars down faster than Dukan.  I think it is because unlimited non-fat dairy can add up to a lot of carbs.  Having no fats at all made me hungry all the time.  The main warning I have is the ONLINE COACHING.  You ONLY have 3 DAYS to decide if it is working for you or they will take your money.  The only silver lining here is finding out how much better I like Atkins.  I had seen something online saying you have 8 days to change your mind, but that is only in the UK.  The US law requires only 3 days for some business transactions and I feel that only companies that believe in their product will give you a longer warranty.  I realize that I should have read the fine print better, but only 3 days?  Come on!

B006L4MWVE|5.0|Imagine this: a country is run by a totalitarian government, which occasionally selects groups of teenagers to methodically kill each other. On TV. Until only one remains.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\"? No, actually it's \\"Battle Royale,\\" a bloody and harrowing movie that came out several years earlier, depicting an alternate Japan where the youth are forced to kill each other. It's one of those movies that is strangely fascinating and filled with social commentary, with brilliant performances from pretty much everyone concerned.<br /><br />A class of high-schoolers are being transported on a bus, when they are gassed to unconsciousness. When they awake, they have electronic collars around their necks. A former teacher named Kitano explains that they have been chosen for the B.R. (\\"Battle Royale\\") Act, wherein teenagers are forced to fight each other to the death until only one is left standing.<br /><br />If you don't play, try to escape, refuse to kill or stray into a \\"death zone,\\" the collars explode.  Each teenager is given food, water and a random item, and are set loose on a remote island.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for them to fall prey to suicide, paranoia, bombs and one student's brilliant efforts to hack the system. As the teens slowly weed each other out, Shuya Nanahara and his girlfriend Noriko try to find a way out that doesn't involve death. But if they refuse to kill, then they must escape the fascist nightmare... which no one has done before.<br /><br />\\"Battle Royale\\" (both the novel and the movie) was condemned in Japan for being so violent, and having a bunch of normal high schoolers killing each other off. But \\"Battle Royale\\" would have been striking even if it hadn't been publicized like that -- not only is it viscerally fascinating, but it asks the question straight-out: how much will people do to survive? Who would you kill to live?<br /><br />It also seems to be a story about how governments will oppress innocent people in response to the brutality of a few. However, the movie avoids any outright preaching -- instead it uncoils a tense plot, peppered with bursts of bloody violence, sexual assault and murder. There's a wild, frenetic energy to the story, and director Kinji Fukasaku unleashes it through every cold, bloodspattered scene.<br /><br />Fun trivia: Fukasaku actually lived through something almost as cold-blooded during World War II, when he saw children having to hide from bombs under EACH OTHER. The survivors had to clear away the corpses.<br /><br />Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda really give outstanding performances in this story as nice, normal, everyday kids like the ones who live down the street, but suddenly they're faced with their friends and classmates... wanting to kill them. Takeshi Kitano gives a bloodcurdlingly creepy performance as Kitano, who is nevertheless given plenty of fleshing-out (such as a fondness for one of the students).<br /><br />Violent, creepy and wonderfully atmospheric, \\"Battle Royale\\" is a brilliant cult movie that takes a look at how far people will go to stay alive. Absolutely brilliant.preaching -- instead it uncoils a tense plot, peppered with bursts of bloody violence, sexual assault and murder.

B005SFR7YE|4.0|I've been a POTO fan for decades, but this DVD of the stage play isn't for purists of the Broadway production.  It's nice to have close-up shots during the performance, but there are enough changes  (ie stationary chandelier, Eric never even sings from it, no elephant in opening opera, ETC) to be a bit disappointing.  I suspect all this could be due to the construction of the theater (stairs on both sides of the stage), but the result is the same, rather disappointing.  Even the touring performances I've seen stayed truer to the NYC production.  Because I collect POTO memorabilia, I'm happy to have this Royal Albert Hall performance.  After watching it, I don't have the urge to watch it again. I wouldn't rate \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" as my favorite based on watching this, even though the performers were spot on with every song.

B0013D8LKO|3.0|Was this movie supposed to be disjointed, amalgam of slo-motion scenes?  Like a dream perhaps?  If, so than it almost succeeds.  Almost because the screenplay is so forced and surreal at times that it feels like the movie was directed by One Take Tony.  Nonetheless, the movie is worth seeing for visuals and it's uniqueness.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|One of the best game apps we've played &amp; by far the best Mahjong.  Well worth a couple of bucks so it's a great bargain as faotd. Highly recommended!
0439023521|4.0|My book club chose this book, so I read it. The theme of this book is ugly on the surface, and has great shock value. Hate it, but it sure makes one think! Children killing children to gain supremacy in a fantasy land...I couldn't bear the idea. Why? What did the author want to convey? I thought about it but couldn't stop reading this well-written, carefully drafted horror story, from which several points emerge.<br />The instinct of survival is inherent in human beings, and Suzanne Collins merges poisoned arrows and missiles and hanging-deaths with spectacle. Physical and emotional love and hate in teenage children...all for survival. She has created a story in fantasy land, but wants us to think, what must it be like for the children growing up in a dictatorship, in countries at war, and countries with natural disaster. Ms. Collins makes us sharply aware of cruelty taking over when there is no free-will. All in the name of winning, surviving for self and family. Thought-provoking fantasy reminding me of great ugliness in the world...as if we didn't know it already! Good book club choice! Great writing.

B0049J3QF4|1.0|I had really hoped this would be good but it was horrible. My kids only watched it once and never even wanted to see it again. I will never buy another pixar movie after seeing this. It seems like there just trying to take my money and produce nothing even close to entertaining. I feel very ripped off.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|For admirers of this juvenile space adventure with a high-quality entertainment system, this Blu-ray set is a real treat. However quibblers complain (sad really, such pettiness and disrespect to the director), the bottom line is that the Blu-ray version of the Star Wars saga looks and sounds incredible.<br /><br />Of course there are some soft shots and minor flaws to overlook; to be expected given episodes 4 - 6 age. But it is clear that considerable care was taken to make this a collection worth buying one more time. The edits made, though minor, are altogether an improvement.<br /><br />To me, the \\"bonus features\\" are merely a reminder of the incredible efforts that went into producing this cultural treasure.<br /><br />It's difficult to imagine any Star Wars fan not delighting in the Blu-ray quality, even if it is a guilty pleasure for self-appointed purist curmudgeons Perhaps they like it that way, being a guilty pleasure, rather than an outright delight.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was an amazing conclusion to the Hunger Games Trilogy. Trust me, the people who diss this book(like Suzanne G.) must not have read the book all the way through. Katniss was as strong and determined as ever, and Peeta played a role throughout the whole book. Sure, there was death and bloodshed, but no more than the first two books. This book had a lot of depth and heart. Suzanne Collins-once again-did an amazing job!
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is super cool but when you buy helmets you cant use them! I have tried everythinh and it still doesn't work
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've never been more impressed with an app than this one.  What I'm using it for are the reading plans and you will be shocked at how many there are to choose from.  Not only are the reading plans for reading the whole Bible, but there are devotional plans (including one by Joyce Meyer) and plans for individual circumstances, such as marriage problems, grief, anxiety and many many more.  You can read the whole Bible or just the New Testament, or some from each every day.  Then, what's even nicer is that once you've picked your plan, you can choose which version of the Bible you want to read.  And then even better, there is a button down on the bottom of the screen to have the Bible read to you!  The Bible is read by a man with a very nice voice - not just a robotic voice.<br /><br />There are many other features, including somehow tapping into live church sessions (I don't think I'd use that so I didn't check it out, but it's right there on the home screen), sharing via Facebook and Twitter and linking to other Bible websites.  You can also opt to have your reading plan emailed to you every day.<br /><br />The app works just great both on my Kindle Fire and my smartphone.  I can't recommend this enough if you are like me and have always wanted to read the Bible more, but just haven't found a way to get yourself to do it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|ive been very unhappy with mahjong options under android.  this is a good, legible, controllable game version.  the additions of golden tiles and quests are a nice new dimention.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|How rare it is for a movie to come along that could change the landscape of society if more parents would adhere to the message in this film. The people who give this movie 1 star just don't get it. First of all, it's a CHRISTIAN movie of course their going to be modeling CHRISTIAN VALUES, what do you expect?  As new parents my husband and I were incredibly touched by the message in this movie. My husband is in law enforcement and I know this movie made him evaluate the kind of father he wants to be to our daughter. As a public school teacher, I would love to see more parents (especially fathers) step up and be courageous enough to be the parents they need to be. Perhaps more than ever before our young people need positive male role models in their lives. I pray that they continue to make powerful Christian based films like this for years to come.

B0067Q42BY|2.0|Awesome game. The issue is that there are ads in this paid version! -4 stars just for that! what was the dev thinking?

B006ON41FC|5.0|Enjoy playing this game....found it hard to put down when I first down loaded it.  Got the app for my kindle for long car and or plane rides.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Nice backgrounds, smooth flow on my xoom. Better than most of the mahjong games I've tried. I would this to friends.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun and entertaining way of playing a classic game. flawless gameplay, good graphics. I would recommend for anyone. Definitely a 5/5 star game
B006UG90RM|5.0|Really had my doubts about this new album especially since I haven't really been into rock/heavy metal in the last 10 years or so. Better than 1984, still don't dig a few of the songs. The best and hardest rock album from Van Halen. So happy to say this is a must buy for anyone who has ever been into hard rock.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love it, anytime I just want to check out what the weather will be like, in a tap it's right in front of my eyes, like magic!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very fun for free game. runs smooth on my device. sound effects are nice and not too loud. it did not ask me for a.review right after installing as one reviewer mentioned. I did the tutorial and played two games before it asked me to review.
B000HGA5PM|5.0|This is one fabulous video that I own in VCR format. I want a digitally remastered DVD in the worst way.  Music, graphics etc. Are beyond belief.  Best ever, David Gilmore at his finest.  Enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game! tons of fun! lots to do. don't like all the ads that pop up constantly. I would recommend it though.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|awsome game cant stop playing i love it...its fun, also entertaining in enjoy playing this game non-stop , it rocks

B005Q1W10A|5.0|For many years now, the presentations of Masterpiece Theater have provided me with many hours of marvelous entertainment, many times allowing me to settle \\"down\\" in my easy chair completely \\"lost\\" in days of yore and completely \\"lost\\" in another world.  This very marvelous tradition, for me, continues in this season two (2) of Masterpiece Theater's  presentation of \\"Downton Abby\\" on three (3)discs  in eight (8) episodes (plus the fabulous \\"Christmas Special \\"aka \\"Christmas at Downton Abby\\" when everything comes to a \\"full boil\\") with each episode about an hour and one-half each.<br /><br />The Brits really know how \\"to do\\" so-called \\"period dramas\\" so very well.  \\"Downton Abby\\", Season two (2) is certainly \\"proof\\" of the aforesaid.  I got very \\"caught-up\\" in the lives and the \\"happenings\\" of the very rich family and the individuals that take care of them.  In Season two (2) World War one (1) is raging bring to the folks that comprise the \\"upstairs\\" gentry and the \\"downstairs\\" servants many \\"upheavals\\", dramas, heartbreaks and disappointments.  All are recreated (along with the era--the costumes are wonderous) so very well.<br /><br />This season of \\"Downton\\" is so greatly acted, directed and written.  I just loved settling into my \\"easy chair\\" getting completely \\"lost\\" in another time and place.<br /><br />(Note to the writers and producers of \\"Downton Abbey\\":  In season two (2) of this series, it seems that the more dastardly characters (such as the \\"Upstairs Maid\\" O'Brien) have been given a little \\"softer edge\\" bordering on being almost \\"humanistic\\",  it is my sincere wish that the next seasons show Thomas a little less nasty--seasons one and two have really shown him to be just plain nasty.)<br /><br />(By the way, I must mention that Maggie Smith is again at her wonderful best.  I just adore her acting skills.)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game easy to posh but hard enough to be interesting. not bad for free. this one I'd have paid for
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is fantastic game.  cant put it down!  Easy to follow.  very good graphics.  I will play it as often as I get a chance.  and I will make chances!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I love X-Men ...always have and probably always will.  When I first heard of the idea behind this I was slightly concerned, but when I heard of the actor choices I felt slightly better.  Then the trailer was released and I got excited.  The movie is amazing, the actors were brilliant and I love the direction they took.  Sure some things were changed from the original X-Men and I'm not just talking about the movies.  Several of the changes were for the better (in my opinion) and I look at XMFC as being separate from the X-Men trilogy as this was in fact a reboot so it should not be linked in any way, shape or form.  McAvoy and Fassbender were perfect, I loved how they portrayed their characters and the relationship between Charles and Erik was beautifully done.  It was heartbreaking and touching and so many more words.  At the end of the movie I was torn and I'm truly looking forward to the sequel for this movie.  The other actors/actresses were brilliant and added to the story...Kevin Bacon was a great choice for villain (in my opinion) and they did an excellent job with the setting for the movie.  I highly recommend it and suggest that you look at this movie as a completely separate universe from the original trilogy as well as the Wolverine movie (because it is...it IS a reboot of sorts).
B00362DRQS|1.0|WOW, wish i would have paid attention to the other reviews about the sound quality... IT SUCKS.  i'm so disappointed, the original CD actually sounds better in my PC.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|[[ASIN:B0062NAX1U Courageous]]After viewing \\"Courageous\\" at the theatre, we ordered copies for ourselves and the men in our lives. The film depicts fathers in realistic situations, with the struggles and challenges life presents. It shows the need our world has for strong, faith-filled, dedicated fathers to help children grow into responsible adults. Also confirms the value of the support found in the Body of Christ to live the life of holiness we are all called to.
B005K17RU0|5.0|More accurate than the Weather Channel apps.  I really like the screen appearance and radar screen.  This id one of my fave apps and it was FREE
0439023513|4.0|So this is the last book of the trilogy but the only one i've bought from Amazon. First I'd like to say that this book is a VERY easy reader. I was first told about it from my 8th grade students i teach religion to once a week. Then my girlfriend started reading them and i thought it was just a girly book but gave it a shot and wow was i happy i did. The plot is great with a few but not too many twists. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a light read that you just can't seem to put down! I only put 4 out of 5 stars because although it was a thrilling end to the trilogy i believe the first book of the series left the bar a little higher than the ending could reach
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game, now with a purpose! not just a seek and find. the story line makes this game even better.
B006UG90RM|3.0|I will keep this short and sweet...I was in radio when the first VH album came out...it was a monster.  This album is a mouse...compared to the first.  It's not an awful album but it is a sub par effort for a band like VH.  I like Diamond Dave...and i'm not into the Hagar / Roth battle...but if you want to hear a really good album pick up Chickenfoot 3.
1594744769|5.0|This is, to me, hands down, one of the most enchanting books I have ever read.  It gave my imagination a welcome jolt to life and I didn't ever want the book to end.  How I wish it was at least 5 times as long!  Mr. Riggs has a rare sense of effortless humor that often had me rolling and yet the book kept me in suspense at the same time.  Well done!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got to read this as my first free book with my Amazon Prime trial membership.  My daughter read the trilogy and raved about how good they were and I wanted something to discuss with her so I read the first book.  I really enjoyed it.  Had to borrow the other two books from my daughter in hard cover so I could read them for free...
B0013FSXTG|5.0|This is an excellent movie with two of the best stars in the industry. The film is very interesting and sustaining to your attention every second. Easy watching for two hours +.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|But not too different. Good stuff. more words more words w w w w w w f f f s a s d f f f. ds
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great game w/ great graphics!I recogmend it to all my friends! I'm glad that they are different levels
B0067Q42BY|5.0|First of all this was a free game of the day that's usually  $5 so I decided  to download it and see what it's  all about.Played it and I love it nice graphics fun addictive game 5 stars.
B00081912E|1.0|I know I should have written this awhile ago. However, the movie I received turned out to be FOUR movies, three of which I DIDN'T order in the first place. Also, the disc of the movie I wanted to see just so happened to be scratched! NOT COOL! Wicked Waste of money!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it! its fun but when it shows up to do the update don't do it! it earases your scores. other than that its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0006J28MI|5.0|Everyone knows that the movies M.Culkin did as a kid were very funny, and this one is no different. I recommend this movie to all M.Culkin fans. (P.S.: I wish I could live in the lifestyle depicted in this movie, even with as packed as my schedule'd be.)
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is amazing!!! everyone should get it....u can be a nut....:) don't believe the bad reviews!!!!! I live this game!!!! get it now!!!!
1592537251|5.0|this book is beautiful. the production of the book is excellent, it is big, nice and full of excellent sketches and art.  I am loving every page, and really get into the scene with the comments the artists make.  Urban sketchers is a wonderful blog and a great source of inspiration, the book is a nice first installment synthesis of it.
0525425578|1.0|Please don't expect another great read for the adult.  It is definitely a book for young teens.  Hopeing to find another great Grisham like the Firm or a few that followed that.  Sorry, it was a big disappointment for me.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|so far this ap works great on my Fire.  the ad when you begin the game is painless as is the tutorial you must endure to unlock some game modes.  the futurism just takes a moment and it demonstrates what is unique about this game.  I think its a grest deal to pick it up fir free.  so what is all the fuss about?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This takes a classic game to a new level.  Graphics are excellent and game  play is speedy.  There are fun special effects with multiple playing modes (quest,  classic and endless.  In classic there are 99 layouts, many background choices,  and 5 different colorful tile sets to choose from. I have played a lot of versions  of this game, often finding my eyes getting tired. This is easy on the eyes as it  zooms in nicely, and I was not straining my eyes to see the difference between the  tiles.  A game should be enjoyable, and this version fulfills that.  I spent  19 dollars on a PC version, and I actually think I will play this one more.  I received on free app day and for that I give a big thanks!  (playing on android tablet with no problems)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Like all mahjog games, this is no exception. The app loaded easily.  was playing in a few minutes .happy to be able to have it go mobile with the fire.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|i really like the quest style of games. This is a good one. the ads on the opening screen are easy to bypass so I do not see that they are an issue. i like this being a FAOTD.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|love this game, easy, fun, fast. Everyone complains about the ads and tutorial. So what, just click and go on. Do wish the tiles were bigger though. Best Mahjong I've found so far.
B0059XTUMC|1.0|A black and white silent film with tedious orchestral music and a predictable story line interrpted by patrons leaving the theater.  The dog had the best role in this movie. It won awards for what?
B0073PZN8O|5.0|[[ASIN:B0073PZIYI In Time]] A great movie! I rented this movie and it was awesome, had to see it twice! I recommend it to anyone who loves trillers! D.H.
B0064BCNA4|3.0|ok okay okay okey yes yes yes yes yes no.no no.I do not like green eggs and Ham says Sam I am.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it's pretty awesome. nice challenges and the squirrel is the cutest thing ever. good gameplay, pretty addicting. thumbs up... away up.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|one of the most addictive games i have played. telling all my friends to play this one. a must gqet at any price.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Thank you so much for providing one of my favorite Mahjong games for my kindle fire. I play this game on facebook on my computer,kindle fire and my blackberry playbooks. Providing free apps is so very kind in this present day economy.@/
0307279189|5.0|Born to Run is a pretty good book. I did not think I would find myself not wanting to put the book down. It starts off kind of on the slow side, but what book doesnt. Born to Run gives you a different outlook on running. I enjoyed it.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have read all the Twilight saga books, and watched all the movies.  I would recommend to everyone to read the books first, as they contain more detail and then watch the movies.  This movie in my opinion is the BEST.  I have watched it 4 times in two days.
B0068RHGJM|2.0|Like others who have written, I have been a die-hard Nightwish fan for years. Maybe my expectations were too high. I have come to expect beautiful melodies with fantastic orchestration. I didn't find that in this album. The orchestration is there but the melodies don't flow. It feels choppy and flashy. In my opinion, it would make a great sound track for a horror flick. It just doesn't have the beautiful melodies that I've come to expect from Nightwish.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love the Twilight Saga books and movies.  I think everyone should read the books first as they have more detail to them, but the movies are great too!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Easy to play. Great interface. Easy to read and responsive to the touch. Great graphics to go with a good old fashioned classic game.
B004EPYZTE|5.0|Most of the reviews of this movie are so pompous they're funny.  Pontificating on which version of Conan is or isn't true to Howard's vision?  I'm an old fart, and I was in high school when the Lancer paperbacks with Frazetta covers first appeared at my local book store.  At the same time, I was reading bodybuilding magazines when an amazing Austrian kid started winning major contests.  Back then it wasn't hard to find some of the old Weird Tales issues, so I even read some of the real Howard stories.  (The Lancer paperbacks were heavily edited, and some of the content wasn't Howard's writing at all.)  My take is that Schwarzenegger's Conan was great, and a lot of fun, even if the critics ridiculed it at the time.  Momoa's Conan isn't the same a Schwarzenegger's, but it's also great, and also a lot of fun.  Everyone involved with this movie was a real fan, and they put their hearts into it.  With almost 30 years having passed since Milius and De Laurentis took their shot at it, I'm happy to see that a new bunch of guys cared enough to give it another go. I hope they get to make another one.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|For anyone who followed the TV series or just caught the occasional episode (enough to know \\"the girls\\") this is a must have. Are you a romantic, do you love happy endings? Happy endings in true \\"Sex and the City\\" style.
B006ON41FC|4.0|great fun, time waster. I have a good time with this even if its just a real waste of time.  a great break from angry birds.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We had heard exciting things about the movie \\"Courageous\\".  Amazon gave us the opportunity to purchase this movie at a discount with our Kindle Fire Prime account.  We received it quickly after it was released on dvd for purchase.  Thank you Amazon for the excellent service. The movie is awesome and we highly recommend purchasing this from Amazon.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Don't listen to the bad reviews. I thought this game was amazingly fun. It did get a little challenging at the very end. I don't think that most of the people reviewed this even finished the game. Losers.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is the best. I have all the angry birds download on all my devices, I just can't put it down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. got app for my lil cousin... good for my entertainment but the games r too hard for kids under 10. not a good app to occupy children.. it just made her mad. I enjoy it a lot more than I thought I would for myself
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I have read 2 of the 4 books, and am starting the 3rd.  I am satisfied, and particularly like that fact that he can recharge his powers  with contact with the earth,(no concrete) fairly quickly, unlike Dresdon, he always was lacking power, and at least the power necessary, and was saved by some \\"other\\" method, trick, etc.  I assume this was nessesary, I like dresden books and read them all, however, again, I like the faster recharge. Think of a gamer who gets killed in the game, but has to wait until the next day to play again.  The plot moves slower, so this seris moves pretty darn fast.<br /><br />Humor, much better than Dresden,<br /><br />Likable, much better than Dresden,<br /><br />2nd main characters, much much better than the police detective in Dresden, she really anoyed me to no end.<br />Ken
B0054JZC6E|4.0|many games many choices, so much fun. both my daughters and I like it. thanks for keeping it free and fun.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is really fun and challenging. It's cool because you get to dress up your squirrel and try to beat different goals.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!! :) i love search games &amp; the story line that goes along with it is pretty awesome so far if you love paranormal things.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|can't get enough of this game. hard enough to hold my interest yet easy enough that my kids can play
0553801473|2.0|It is getting out of hand! Too many sub-plots make it confusing. I did not enjoy it as much as previous books.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Very nice movie with non-standard plot - three guys compete for 365 days trying to spot as many birds as possible across America. Recommend.
B0078JOAOI|3.0|Can someone explain to me why Lori went after Rick and Glen? Going to watch it again to see if any explaination is given. Seems like a very weak plot device, like in Dawn of the Dead (remake) where the girl goes after the dog. Women drivers, seriously.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I downloaded this app to both my smart phone and my kindle fire. I love that i can listen to my daily Bible reading no matter where i am.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|As others have said,  ads should not be there.  I tried to play classic but your forced to play some tutorial.  Removed app instead
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the app a lot but I don't like that you have to unlock the games but outer then that it is cool
B006ON41FC|5.0|Loving this game....  I have to fight with my 11yr so I can get my kindle back so I can play....  He loves it to...
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this is a really fun version of this game I love it the puzzles are interesting and so is the story boards
B0072OFM28|4.0|I REALLY MISS ANDY, HE WAS SPARTACUS AND ALWAYS WILL BE, HOWEVER , LIAM IS DOING A GOOD JOB TAKING OVER THE ROLE. I JUST THINK WE NEED TO GIVE HIM ALIITLE MORE TIME. I ALSO LIKE THE WAY THEY ARE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THE SUPPORTING CAST.I DO NOT GET STARZ SO MY FRIEND TAPES THE SHOW FOR ME. IT HAS ME ON MY SEAT WEEK AFTER WEEK.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|If you watched Kevin Costner's heartfelt memorial tribute to Whitney yesterday in her own childhood church, I wonder if you felt as I did that no other male lead (notwithstanding Costner's gracious words) could come close to the chemistry evident between these two stars.  That this caring was real and carried the movie to greatness, completing with Whitney's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" has taken on a unique and much deeper meaning now. I saw this movie when it was released 20 years ago (Whitney was only 28) and to me it was 5 stars. Last evening I watched it again, now in the broader context of my life and Whitney and Kevin's lives and the world we live in. It is sad that someone so alive was harmed and diminished and cut short in living her life by drugs and alcohol and the pressures that go with stardom, and we already have too many lessons like this.  I want to encourage you though (if you have not already) to experience first Kevin's tribute and then watch them together in the movie (all the better if for yet another time). Thank you Whitney for the extraordinarily gift you have given us in your life and career and left with us. Thank you Kevin for being in your movie and real life and death too Whitney's amazingly wonderful guardian --  of her life and spirit.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is pure illumination. My son loves this game.. Thanks for making it possible.....kudos to the dev team..Thx Amazon.
0439023513|1.0|If you would like to be fascinated and entertained, read the first two books in The Hunger Games trilogy.  If, on the other hand  you want to feel empty, bored, and depressed, read Mockingjay.  It won't disappoint.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|There is no god, this is the most insane game of &quot;telephone&quot; ever.How can it be that for 2,000+ years people have had to use a fairytale in order to be civil? No one has any proof there is no god, but by analogy believing in the message this book delivers (which is an inconsistent message to say say the least), is no different than a four year-old believing in Santa...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've played this for hrs and still enjoy it. For those of you who like solitaie this is the app for you.  The best thing about this app is you can go back and play the same hand to see where you messed up and then you can win the next time. :)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun fun fun fun fun game! lots of levels to go through, hard to get bored with it! love it
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great graphics..fun to play!  the progression of the game makes it more challenging.  far more fun than the boring manning games out there.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Please keep this as up to date as the one in Android Market. I'm tired of seeing the notification, but unable to.update it.
B0071QIN00|4.0|It will freze on you every now and then, but really fun and challenging. I would recommend this to a person who enjoys tough games and also someone who doesn't get frustrated.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|works great and is interesting to play. nice graphics and gameplay.  this is the only mahjong game I will be downloading.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great game but needs to have a few easier games and more ways to earn points. overall, hours of fun.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fantastic game!  Thank you very much for offering as free app of the day. Ignore the people who feel they are so entitled that they complain about pushing a continue button. They get a $5 app that is awesome and yet they still find something to complain about.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This app is really good for those who like puzzle. I'm glad this app was the free app of the day. Hopefully we get.another great app tomorrow. Also I'm loving this on the kindle fire.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love this version of mahjong. it will be my new go to choice when i want some mahjong down time.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is very addicting. when I first started playing I was attached. the only thing I didn't like was that it forces you to rate the game but other than that its fun
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is my favorite past time right now I am ranked almond only one question, is it possible to make this game any better????? I think not
0316113506|4.0|Really?  We all know it to be true, but this book shows why exercise is good for your brain and stimulates learning.  That's right, your brain.  The part of the body we know the littlest about is the subject of this book.  I liked the opening chapters the most--especially when they discussed how educators around the country are taking the SPARK concept and incorporating it into their schools.  The result?  Better achievement outcomes for students.  After reading Spark, you will never be able to think about exercise in  the same light again.  The last half of the book gets a little heavy on the science aspect and is less practical, but it is still interesting.<br /><br />Spark shines a light on the importance of exercise that elevates the heart rate to 80% of its capacity for at least three times a week.  It's not just exercise that has a great impact upon the brain, but it is strenuous exercise--exercise that gets our heart rate elevated and releases chemicals throughout our body that make us feel better, bring healing, and make us smarter.  That's right, smarter.  If you need motivation to get up off the couch and get moving, this is the book for you.  You won't regret it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The graphics on this are amazing on my Sony Tablet S! The auto zoom feature works wonderfully and the game is very easy to play. I would recommended this for anyone with a tablet because it would be very difficult to play on a phone screen.
B006ON41FC|5.0|haven't heard my four year old laugh this much at a game...and I was there laughing with him.  Game locked up a couple of times, but it wasn't much of an issue.  Worth trying out...kinda like Dead Runner for kids.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This cover looks great and is very durable and high quality.  The color is a very beautiful deep red and it fits my Kindle Fire perfectly!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I don't know what the big deal is, people.  The opening screen shows their other apps with a button push to play Mahjong... big whoop! If a company makes a good game, then I am interested in checking out others by them so, thank you G5, for saving me search time. Now, to what counts:  This game is awesome.  And, the adventure play is a bonus.  Download it now.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm a long-time Mahjong fan,  this app is a must for Mahjong players. Graphics are awesome and the tutorial very useful for beginners.
B000VPPMXO|5.0|One pair came with my Roomba 780.  Each LH runs on a pair of \\"C\\" alkaline batteries estimated by manufacturer to last 6 months.  We shall see.<br /><br />On the LH are two switches, the top one provides you the option of toggling it's function as either a Light House or a Virtual Wall. By strategically placing the Light Houses, one can divide the cleaning area into two sections and the pair together divides the cleaning area into 3 cleaning areas - to be cleaned in succession one after the other, the LHs signals for Roomba to systematically complete one area before allowing it to move into & clean the next area, and in turn the third area.  This way the cleaning is more effectively managed for better results.  When all the sections are complete, the LHs navigate the Roomba back to its charging base.  This is what is referred to as the \\"Room To Room Navigation\\" capability.  A very useful feature for the larger home.<br /><br />The Virtual wall OTOH, simply prohibits the Roomba from crossing to the other side.  This works to keep Roomba out of areas not requiring cleaning or the Scooba from your carpets or expensive rugs.<br /><br />My first run took 1 hour to clean 150sqf.  Today I deployed the LHs and Roomba effectively cleaned each section for 25mins each before returning to it's base. Beautiful navigation. The same upstairs.  I can't praise the 780 enough.  If you are deciding between the 770 and 780, and your home can be discretely sectioned, get the 780.  If you are in a studio apartment, then the Room to Room Navigation is uneccessary.<br /><br />Roombas 577 and 780 comes with a pair each.
B006ON41FC|3.0|at first it is fun but after a while it gets boring. I got it for free, but do not buy this game. it is not worth it.
B004N44SOI|5.0|I really loved The Heroin Diaries, and purchased this CD expecting more of the same. While it is undeniably the same band, TIGH is not quite as hard-edged. The title track is the clear-cut rocker-song on the album - a great way to open the CD. \\"Lies of the Beautiful People\\" - lyrically, this is obviously a theme that has done before, and done to death. Nikki likes to make it out like he's some philosophical genius, but this song's theme has actually been done to death. Still a very cool song, though! James Michael's vocals are simply amazing, very versatile! And DJ Ashba's guitar work is amazing as well. Track 3 - \\"Are You With Me Now\\" - is my personal favorite. I see a lot of reviews bagging on that song due to its commercial feel. That doesn't bother me. Who says a rock song can't have a catchy hook? Maybe it doesn't sound like some genre-breaking masterpiece, but so what? The lyrics are easy to relate to, and the chorus is super catchy. The only criticism I have is the track \\"Sure Feels Right\\". It's a very cool, mellow tune, but has a definite country-music overtone to it, and doesn't seem suited to this band or the CD. It does demonstrate the band's versatility, but it's kind of a misfit song in the midst of the others.<br /><br />The ballad that ends the album, \\"Skin\\", is getting a lot of attention. I have the same problem with this song as I have with \\"Lies of the Beautiful People\\". It's a good song, but the topic has been done to death before, and it's not that ground-breaking or profound piece that so many people are making it out to be. The piano is wonderful, though, and James's vocals, as always, are phenomenal.<br /><br />Honestly, I was kind of so-so about the album when I first listened to it, but after repeated listens, it really grew on me. I enjoy listening to every song on here now. I have definite favorites, but I no longer skip through it.<br /><br />Don't buy this album if you're expecting a hard-rocking ride all the way through. But there's a little something for everyone in here - those who can appreciate different genres and types of music will really enjoy this. Those close-minded \\"Metal or die\\" types who think that if music doesn't rock hard, it sucks...you won't enjoy this. Personally, I appreciate diversity in my music, so Sixx:AM gets 5 stars from me :)n here - those who can appreciate different genres and types of music will really enjoy this.

B00005S6K6|5.0|LOVE this movie!  I first saw it on late night TV when I had just moved into my first apartment. I was not really a DeNiro or Streep fan, but the story just reeled me in.  The acting is phenomenal and I liked that it was a story more about an emotional affair than a physical one.  I searched for a few years and finally found the DVD here on Amazon.  Best purchase I ever made  :)
B003KT3NRA|1.0|I had to struggle to listen to this whole CD. It was mediocre at best, and it bored me to tears. I found myself fast forwarding halfway through each song. The cover songs were uninspired and stayed so close to the originals, you have to wonder why Vince even bothered to record them. Just my opinion, but I figure if you're going to do a cover and include it on your album, it better be a new take on the original, something different. Even the Crue cover of \\"Smoking in the Boys' Room\\" - which I never liked all that much (although the video was cool), was at least a little different than the original. I certainly don't think anyone should have to pay good money to hear Vince-karaoke! And as for the other songs on the album, it sounded to me like Vince was trying really hard to recreate the girls-and-free-living vibe of Motley Crue, but he failed miserably. I love Motley Crue, and I love Vince's vocals with Motley, but this CD was just...boring and lame.
B006ON41FC|4.0|great game! only four stars though because there's still some bugs it lags at times on my Droid Incredible 2 Android 2.3
B005LAIGW8|1.0|Ghost rider must save boy from the Devil. First let me say I am a Nicolas Cage fan and I do not blame him for this abortion of a film. I blame the director and the writers of this pitiful excuse for a movie. If you pay full price plus the 3D charge you are in for a total rip off. I would pass on a $1.00 rental on this turd let alone the thought of paying for a blue ray copy. I fought myself not to see this pitiful movie and gave into some internet hype and radio plugs by Nick Cage but I should have went with my gut. There is no story here that is worth seeing, it is as if a 15 year old stoner came up with this plot while slamming Robitussin with his drop out buddies. This is the worst movie of 2012 so far and I pray it is the worst that I pay to see in the theater for the rest of the year. The Coup de grâce is Christopher Lambert, that alone should keep you away from this turd.
B006ON41FC|5.0|for all those people who hate this game because of feint. you aren't right you Kean faces. this game is amazing. pecan level suck that

0307956350|5.0|*****<br />I thought this was a terrific spy thriller and psychological thriller. I really enjoy the kind of thriller that doesn't involve a lot of action (like buildings exploding, wild car chases, gun fights, etc.) but more intellectual fun--if you are like me, then you'll enjoy this book.<br /><br />The novel takes place from the point of view of the main character, Kate Moore, who decides to follow her husband to Luxembourg where he will start a new and very lucrative job. They bring their children along and start a whole new life. Things are not quite what they seem, and are complicated by Kate's denial and her needs to believe certain things. A key part of the story is the true identity and allegiance of a mysterious couple, who seem to not to be who they purport to be. At an entirely other level, this novel is also an exploration of identity as Kate Moore struggles to be a full-time mother and homemaker, missing her high-level job for the CIA.<br /><br />The time period flashes back and forth at pivotal times adding to the suspense. I was tense/excited as I read, waiting for the next thing to happen. The storyline is full of twists and turns and surprises, including an unexpected ending. What an enjoyable read!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love it its fun and the puzzles are great waiting for new levels great for kindle fire recommend it for anyone
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is a really fun game. The story quest is a great attempt to try something new and fun to Manjong  Traditionalist will not like it, but hey the game doesn't force you to play story mode. Works great on my Kindle Fire. Minus 1 star for ads in a paid app, but seriously its not that big a deal. Beyond the main menu, once your in the game there are no ads. Don't let the 1star app reviews based solely on the ad issue detour you from this app.
B0041YI4ZO|4.0|If you really enjoy a good martial arts movie, Ip Man 3 is very good movie, I enjoyed it much.  This version of Ip Man is all in Chinese Language with English subtitles.  There is another version where you can change the language into English.  But which ever one, I enjoyed this movie very much.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Not a bad adventure game but the end is unsatisfying.  It is sudden and basically three panels of text, no animation or new graphics.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game app has just the right amount of difficulty to be a fun.  A good tool for your brain for problem solving.
B005QJZ5FA|1.0|Oh my gosh. This is such a bad message. It's basically saying, kill yourself because that's what you're born to do. Isn't that horrible? It has a good beat and Lana Del Ray has a good voice in all. But it's really bad to repeat 'Born to Die'. Right? So please don't waist your money and buy this stupid CD with this bad, bad message. Trust me.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|i really love this app alot and it works great on my kindle fire!!! I would definitely recommend this app!
B005UT29Z0|2.0|I gave this movie two stars because it is well crafted and finely acted. However the story is awful. In it  we hear detailed arguments why we should accept corrupt and destructive business practices.  The decent characters in the story make a few weak protests and then just give in.  By the end of the film I felt sick.
0920668372|5.0|All right all you negative reviewers, chill the F out.  I remember my mom reading this to me when I was a little tiny kid, and thinking that it was sweet that his mom would come hug him (as a teenager, grownup, etc) in the middle of the night, cause mommies love their kids just as much even when they're all grown up.  If I could understand, at age 4-5, that this is an allegory, than you should be able to grasp that concept as well. It's a touching story that speaks volumes to little kids, so don't overthink it.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This movie is very powerful!  My husband watched it with our teenage soons and it definitely had an impact.  The story is very moving and hits home regarding the accountability we have as parents!  Sometimes it takes someone else to show us where we need to grow.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great graphics and smooth actions.  Playing on LG Optimus V.  Really like the one finger zoom during the comic book style story line.  Very playable on the small LG screen.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this app!  The only problem is I cannot put it down!  Honestly, I am losing sleep over this game.
B006ON41FC|4.0|its got variety but the squirrels eyes scare me, but its addicting and easy to play espeacially for someone if they have a hard time playing other games
B001F290E4|5.0|Never listen to Seal before, he caught my attention late one evening. He was doing a concert on cable was about to change the channel but his style grabbed my attention. My fiance and I finished listening to the concert and became instant fans. I even rip a couple of CD's and shared them with co-workers who loved the CD also........
B0067Q42BY|3.0|it is very fun but not all that addicting. sorry to all you mahjong lovers.... its just...well.... its OK. butit is still fun to play when bored
B0050DIWHU|5.0|Even as someone who has committed to an academic biomedical path for the foreseeable future, who you might not expect to be within the book's intended audience, I found the material in this book to be quite useful. It is strongest in discussing how to develop mutually enriching relationships and how to tap into the resources of your network to help achieve your goals. This is unsurprising because Reid started one of the most robust online social networks, and Ben, as evidenced by his blog and connections, is a networking maven. So, I'd recommend it especially to people who want to improve in these areas. I'd also recommend it to people who are somewhat skeptical that networking matters, because this book might very well help convince you that it does.  Here are a few of the other particularly interesting themes:  1) In part of one chapter they discuss the idea of an internal review, wherein you tally up your hard assets (e.g., cash, holdings) as well as your soft assets (e.g., skills, experiences, and connections). For the soft assets, this involves the use of a sort of \\"Bayesian evidence\\", which means that you must not only consider the evidence that you are strong in an area but also the evidence that you are weak in it. Now, just like a company doesn't tell its competitors what its weak points are, you probably wouldn't want to tell a potential employer that you are weak in an area. But, it is useful to be honest with yourself about your relative strengths and weaknesses, because it can help you allocate your personal investments in more optimal ways. This is a topic in which their \\"think of your career like an entrepreneur thinks of his/her company\\" analogy has tremendous power.  2) The book devotes some time to arguing against the idea that you have a true self with one true passion, which you need to devote time and energy to \\"discovering\\". In reality we all have many selves, many possible selves, many possible passions, and many possible routes to achieve ouraspirations. Ben and Reid tap into this framework in their explanation of the \\"almost ready, aim, fire, aim, fire\\" career strategy. They discuss how the most useful way to learn whether you like something is not to think about it but to simply try it, in as low cost of a way as possible. This reminded me of both Charlie Hoehn's \\"Recession Proof Graduate\\" and Cal Newport's \\"Career Craftsman Manifesto.\\" The strategy espoused in this book relates to both of those strategies in a complementary way.  3) One thing that you will notice when reading the book is that it often references LinkedIn. (Just to be clear, this isn't *all* that common--using the wonderful Kindle search application and filtering out the times where Reid is discussing his own career, I count 24 such instances.) Some might see this as \\"propaganda\\", but I actually liked it and found it useful. There is a trade-off between being giving abstract advice, which could potentially be relevant for decades but is more difficult to know how to implement, and giving actionable advice, which has a shorter shelf-life but is easier to know how to employ. Much of the advice in this book is on the abstract side, but the references to LinkedIn (as well as to other contemporary tools like Twitter and Facebook) help ground the book's advice in today's real world.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love playing Mahjong Artifacts, was so happy to see it as the free app. I had tried the sample before and really enjoyed it.
B003Y5HWJU|1.0|I look at the favourable reviews for this program and wonder how, or why, the reviewers have not noticed:  (a) that the script-writing is awful.  Where to begin?  The ridiculous liberties taken with history would be a start.  The implausible dialogue would be a close second.  Did nobody read the script aloud before they started filming?  Did nobody do any study of how people spoke at the time?  The two dimensional character development would be third. Characters cut from cardboard, stuck together with wall-paper paste.  (b) the acting is just bad.  It would be bad even for a soap opera.  \\"Wooden\\" is an appropriate adjective for much of it.  Then there are the ever-painful attempts by latter-day actors to mimick accents.  If you have no idea what an Irish accent sounds like, don't try to do an Irish accent.  If you don't have any idea what an Italian accent ought to sound like, don't do an Italian accent.  If you don't do Polish, or Yiddish, or German, then leave it alone.  (c)  the camera-work is bad in a way that is difficult to explain.  It is the kind of camera work that might be ok in an airplane safety video explaining how to buckle your lap belt, how to find the life vest, and how to proceed to the emergency exit.  That anybody can find work in TV drama with this kind of camera-work is a very sad comment about TV.  (d)  the \\"no-name brand\\" camera work may flow from the direction, which, not surprisingly, is awful.  There is nothing clever in this production.  Nothing.  It includes the same gratuitous violence, unrealistic, over-the-top, \\"violence-as-pornography\\" you would expect.  The direction can never, ever, leave the viewer to figure out anything by himself or herself.  Heaven forbid that any scene should have any (intentional) irony, or anything but the most obvious, leaden double-entendre.  That is why the camera is positioned and operated as if they are trying to make an instructional video, so that the viewer can't possibly misunderstand what the director is trying to get across.  It is why the dialogue is wrong: Always use contemporary 2011 dialogue, and, if in doubt, make it stilted, and throw in lots of 2011-style swearing, because there is a chance that if the script required dialogue from the 1920's, spoken as it might actually have been, the viewers wouldn't understand - they might need sub-titles, and the intended audience for this show isn't the kind that knows what to do with sub-titles.  Use every possible cliche or worn phrase, to make sure that every possible viewer, no matter how stupid, will understand them. The production seems to be driven by the principle: Why do anything subtle, when you can hit the viewer over the head with it ten times instead.  It is why the violence can't be just ordinary violence, it has to be cartoon violence, pornographic violence, with large quantities of blood splattered on everything in the scene - otherwise the audience might not understand that they really, really, really killed the man. Both the violence and the ridiculous sex are over-acted in the manner of slapstick comedy, or vaudeville, or silent films before talkies.  It's a cartoon caricature.  It is clumsy, ham-fisted, bull-in-a-china-shop, second or third-grade work.  When the three stooges did this kind of stuff, it was intended to be funny.  This production wasn't intended to be funny. It isn't.  It is just bad.  If there is one word that sums up the multitude of failings of this production it would be: \\"Artless\\".  The only things about this series that are reasonably well done?  Somebody has paid attention to costumes, furniture, and vintage cars; somebody else knew a fair bit about music.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The Official Sony brand Dual Shock controller.  Identical to the one shipped with the system.  Personally I don't like after market controllers so this one was the best option for me.  Durable and functional.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a long time mystery/thriller reader I was getting bored with the same old-same old. This book was an impulse purchase and I was so happy to have brached out. It was an awesome book and kept me guessing until the end.......and the guessing some more. The material is very important for the cyberworld we live in today.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this gives a very nice twist to mahjong! so many different ways to play, all very entertaining! once you.start playing you are hooked, I really like the extra tiles.....even more fun!
B0067Q42BY|2.0|After paying for an app I don't expect to see ads, yet there they are, EVERY TIME I PLAY.  Open network sockets is always a red flag for a game. Too bad too since otherwise it is a solid  app.  Stop begging for reviews and let the product stand alone without network connections.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|works well. has several modes of play. is intuitively written and uses nice tile templates and backdrops. interface seems both accurate and responsive
0385534639|4.0|I liked it. It was simplistic writing but told the story in a very rich and beautiful way. Resolution was a little weak, but I enjoyed it more for the writing than the plot.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|entertaining and easy to use and play. highly recommend especially if u have kids to keep entertained. even fun for the adults
B00447G2PM|5.0|I was blown away watching this with my panasonic P55ST30 and XpanD 3D glasses. I agree with others that it is short for the money, but I have spent tons more in the past to go snorkling in the Caribbean and never saw so many sea creatures with so much clarity and safely in 3D!:-)
B006ON41FC|4.0|The game does not explain how to use the stuff you purchase at the store such as head starts.  This game is very addictive for whole family.  I would give this game a 5 star if it had better directions on how to use the stuff you buy at the store.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love Mahjong and hope to have many hours of entertainment with it.  I am impressed that it comes with a story.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is the first time I have ever played this game.  It is really a lot of fun! Thank you for making it a free app, now I know how much fun it is...it is worth paying for if you missed the free version!
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I bought the paperback book a while back.  I read it cover to cover in a few days.  Yes, I skipped over some of the tedious parts that seemed like \\"filler\\" material.  All in all I found the character development to be pretty good.  You can see it coming that the bridge carriers will be taken under wing and taken care of as soon as you encounter the ethical lord. (not giving names away for spoliers and all)  All in all I have read this book three times.  And just like many other lengthy books I have read I find something new or a different way to connect the dots each time.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Extremely fun and highly addictive! I love this game! The levels progress and it forces you to think and use reason. Its not just a time game its a mind game as well!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this os one of the best apps ever I never had any problems with the open feint either I would recomend this to anyone with a kindle fire.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like this game and the graphics are quite nice! It was worth me checking it out.You should get it too it is free today!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Nice job on this game works great on the kfire like the buying things with points you get in the game!
B005UKMWMY|4.0|It's still a great show. House is a fantastic character whom is deeply developed through the writing. He is still somewhat unpredictable, so that's pretty impressive!  This season features a bit less drama than last season and some more medical diagnoses.  House actually is less seen in this season, but it's enjoyable. They really have a fully developed team of characters. For example, recent episodes focus more on Chase. He may be a bit one-dimensional often but they really made him quite a bit more interesting in these episodes.  Here are some frustrations of mine:  He uses the same diagnoses a lot. This season, look for tertiary syphilis. It's the new lupus. The symptoms are very wide, so it makes for a great plot development. It's kinda a House diagnosis, because it involves sex and guilt and all that that House would berate the patient for.  Some of the medical diagnoses are also extremely off, even to someone who doesn't know much about medicine. For example, on a 45 year old white man he gave a diagnoses that is only really common among Southern Asian children of the ages 2-5. Of course, it is a drama, not an educational show, but if a college student can spot things wrong with this show, it takes away from it.  Sometimes, they go away from the patient for an extremely long time to follow some dramatic twist. Sometimes, the show has little to do with the patient or anything medical.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Really fun game so worth it. Lots of fun I'm a teen and love this game is enjoyable and full of laughs not bloody like I feared
B0067Q42BY|4.0|the game play is good. i have been searching for a mahjong game to enjoy. this one may be it. except, the developers are SHAMELESS BEGGERS!!!  when first open you have to view all their other apps, then a few levels later, they ask for your review of the app.<br />other than that it works great on my r2d2 and my transformer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it took a bit of working to figure out exactly what I was suppose to be doing in each game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love this game - cant stop playing - worth your time!!! the squirrel is too cute especially when I crash him!!!
0553801503|3.0|After the past three books I was extremely interested in reading the fourth in the series. I am half way through and extremely disappointed. Martin introduces many new characters, the plot is confusing, there is nearly no movement, and it is very slow. I hate to say it but this book was a disappointment.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Got as a free app loving it! Easily one of the better games ive tried in months good replay value.
B0071QIN00|4.0|I give this a 4 rate- star is a really challenging apps,those are the apps I like.the problem is is too challenging.I cant pass level 5.and if I was make the prices for app I wolud'nt give 1.99. I would give 1.50.Overall I give this app 10/8.5
B004H1V5RU|1.0|I really wish the Epic was made better.  We have had the original Perplexus for a while and we all LOVE it!  I was so excited to order this, and when it arrived I was SO disappointed!  The quality is so much lower than the original one.  The Epic feels like the same plastic as a pop bottle, literally.  It is so soft and flimsy!  Ours is so delicate feeling compared to the other, that I was afraid to even let the kids (ages 6 and 7) play with it.  You can even tell just by looking at the inside that it isn't very well made.  One drop and I'm sure it would break.  I realize this isn't a toy that should be thrown and kicked around, but it should  be able to survive a roll of the couch, it is a toy after all.  Material quality aside, ours has a defect as many of the other reviews' had.  One of the railings were disconnected, making it impossible to play past that part. SO disappointing!  I also run the prize counter at our church and am in charge of ordering prizes for it, and I have averaged buying about 6 Perplexus games a month (junior, original and Epic), and I no longer will purchase any of them.  I don't understand why there is such a difference in quality here.  It's pathetic actually.  It feels like a pop bottle, and is almost too delicate to play with IF you don't get one with a defect.  If the makers of Perplexus changed the quality to be like the original, I would order again and this would be, hands down, a 5 star toy.  Until then I wont re-buy personally, or for the prize counter at our church.  By cutting corners on cost, they have created a toy that won't hold up and has many defects.  It may save them money up front to cut cost on materials, but it creates a low quality toy and they are losing sales because of it.  I'd happily pay $10 more than the current price of this toy if it were made to last.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is the coolest game ever and I love it! what r u waiting for get it I git it for the free al of the day and I'm so happy and if you miss it as the free app its expensive but a great game but myself I would spent that much money on and game

B006PHD0RW|5.0|Bag it is one of the best Android Games available!  It is well worth the price.  The gameplay is smooth and the graphics vivid.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are great for times when you're waiting. short, sweet, and fun. kids like them, too. pretty good app.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|What a letdown! I feel like I just wasted months of my life following this series. Katniss was supposed to be the symbol of hope... but in the end, she was nothing but a hollow shell. What  a waste of a great character.   After reading the first two books and learned that a movie was coming, I started convincing family and friends that the movie was a must-see (like Star Wars and Harry Potter).  Now, I'm not even going to watch the movie because I know the ending would be such a disappointment. I am a Peeta fan and never warmed up to Gale.Yet I still hated the ending.
B006ON41FC|1.0|worst game ever!!  i have a tablet and love games so i downloaded it and as sone as i opened the app it made my tablet crash,it wouldn't  turn on for the rest of the day. i would not recomend this app to anyone,its not worth you money
B006ON41FC|5.0|great game, easy to play,  open feint can be turned off, don't believe the conspirators, definitely worth a dollar! nineteen twenty
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love it.  it was one of the best apps ive ever had. it is cate and fun. works great on kindle fire.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a great and fun game to play i recomend buying this game. This is an amazing game.to play when you are bored or have nothing better to do

B0067Q42BY|4.0|Good if you don't know how to play. A little flashy for more experienced players. Has a nice little story also.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great app, its fun, a time waster and is still intellectual! I love that it has a storyline, along with short comic strips. Totally worth it!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Both beautiful and functional. Works very well on my Kindle Fire. Casual weather observers need this app. Not just eye candy but delivers more than most weather apps. Highly recommend!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I ordered this for my 8 yr old grandson.  He just LOVES it! He says that it is now his favorite. Swampy comes in a close 2nd!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game...warning highly addictive.  The graphics are great, the music gives me a headache but that's what mute is for.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game has my spare time waiting for meetings, and on break occupied with gliding through the forest collecting acorns.  only complaint is program becomes boggy if I forget to clear my phone memory and other running programs first.  A must download!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I finally learned how to play! neat and easy, good for passing time. maybe could have a tutorial but find someone to teach u and use it for practice.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accuweather is a big step up from any other weather app out there.  The graphics are sleek and true to your actual weather at that moment.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good for more challenging games. tons to pick from. keeps you busy. likely yo find a couple of personal favorites. and hey, its free.
B005VPRETE|5.0|We are having a lot of fun with this set.  The most fun is after you build it the way the directions say and then make it the way you want it... remodeling.  The directions are done very well with pictures.  I think this can improve dexterity and make a child think mechanically about how things go together. Once built it stays together well. But most of all is just Fun!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games me and my brow never get bored. so many games always something to look toward to. my favorite game. are on here now
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so much fun. I play it for hours and hours! it is the best game I have ever played
0756404738|5.0|I once thought that GRRM's Song of Ice & Fire series represented the pinnacle of what was possible in the modern fantasy genre.  Now, I'm not so sure.  Both series are absolutely fantastic in their own way.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is superior to Name of the Wind.  First, where NOTW shows us a struggling main character constantly getting his butt kicked, almost to the point of being depressing for the reader, we cheer for him as he realizes significant success in NOTW. Second, the diversity and vibrance of the scenery is far better in AWMF.  NOTW was about the woods, a crappy seaside town, and the University.  AWMF is about far more than that, including one place that literally is out of this world. Finally, where NOTW ended like a cut rope and, frustratingly, resolved no major or minor plot strings, AWMF is something different.  To be sure, our hero is, once again, down on his luck at the end of this book, but his Phoenix-like victory in Book III is palpable.<br /><br />I cannot wait for Book III and many future works from Mr. Rothfuss.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great game. Works fine on the KFire, no prbelms at all. Everyone is whining about the pop up ads, but if you go to the option settings you can just click them off. The tutorial takes all of a minute &amp; explains about a few key points in the tiles, no big deal.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|a variety of ways to play and special tiles and just an all around great game! good bang for your buck
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun game, runs great on kindle fire. I don't really think the ads are noticeable ....get it while its free..5.00 is a little steap for what it is.

0743497465|5.0|I read this book and Digital fortress while waiting for Da Vinci Code to come out in paperback. My Wife told me that in her opinion Angels and Demons was better than Da Vinci Code, but she had never read these books. To my surprise both Deception Point and Digital Fortress were page turners. Plots were great and the books moved along from the first page to a satisfactory and compelling ending. These two novels keep you guessing the whole way. I didn't find Angels and Demons to be as good as my wife thought it was, but it is still 4 stars. Despite its numerous errors of biblical history (I counted about 50 before I stop counting), Da Vinci Code is still a great book. I enjoyed these two less famous books almost as much. I also found the Lost Symbol to be a very good book (5 star) but don't know enough about the subject matter to know if the history was any better Da Vinci Code.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|You'll hear many complaints - mostly from long-time Coldplay fans and/or fans of their older music - about the group's newest CD, Mylo Xyloto. The reason being the obvious change between the 4 main older CD's and their one newest.  In the shortest explanation possible, what many fail to understand is this: The artist who keeps the same exact style for their whole career may be safe from the possibility of persecution, but their work is bound to get old sooner or later.  Coming from a listener of Coldplay since their first album, I am extremely inspired by Coldplay's ability to take a leap and bring about change that I'm sure they knew would face disapproval. What they've done is something many others fail to succeed in achieving.  Now onto the actual album.  All of the songs successfully include a similar style, although at the same time they all sound different. They transition very well, and all have a unique tune that hasn't been reused and recycled by many of the cookie cutter artists you hear today.  One song may have an acoustic feel about it (such as the obvious choice, U.F.O), while another may have a poppish-sounding feel (such as Princess of China).  A lot of people dislike Princess of China, for the reason that it's a collaboration with Rihanna. I can see why many wouldn't like this song; I mean, it's Rihanna, a pop artist, playing with Coldplay, a soft-rock band. Nonetheless, I like it all the same.  The one problem I've found is that about five to four of the songs could've had the vocals louder. For instance the second-to-last track, Don't Let it Break Your Heart, has very soft vocals. Regardless of their intentions, Chris's wonderful voice deserves to be equal with all the other instruments.  So although the low volume of their singer's voice has taken away a star, this album has helped me realize that, whether it be small or large, sometimes change can be a great help.  ~ Lilian
B0067Q42BY|5.0|game is very addicting. lots of stragety needed at times. not a fan of the comic thing though. lots of fun.
B00622HJ4K|5.0|I loved this one! Any time Castle or Beckett saves the other's life there are always sweet yet funny moments! Great episode! A little more \\"intense\\" than what is typically Castle, but it's nice once in a while, and they still manage to squeeze in some humor!

B0062P3392|4.0|Although it shares nearly the same title as Sam Peckinpah's film, \\"Killer Elite\\" beyond the fact that it involves government affiliated assassins has nothing to do with the film. \\"The Killer Elite\\" (Peckinpah's film) is based on the novel \\"Monkey in The Middle\\" by Robert Rostand while THIS film is based on a \\"nonfiction\\" book by Sir Ranulph Fiennes called \\"The Feather Men\\".<br /><br />Mercenary assassins Danny Bryce (Jason Statham), Davies (Dominic Purcell), and Meier (Aden Young)must save their colleague Hunter (Robert DeNiro)who is taken prisoner for a failed assassination. If Bryce, Davies and Meier don't complete Hunter's mission (for which he was promised $6 million) to assassinate the killers of the Sheikh Amr's sons, they'll kill him. Complicating Bryce's mission are \\"the Feather Men\\" a group of former SAS members who protect their own. Their enforcer Spike Logan (Clive Owen) is sent to investigate and prevent the killing of its members.<br /><br />A well made thriller from first time feature director Gary McKendry, \\"Killer Elit\\" positively bristles with energy and features something a bit unusual for a thriller of this type--actual character development. It's not enough that the action sequences are well designed, many unique and well shot the fact that McKendry and screenwriter Matt Sherring create a compelling thriller with a solid story and solid performances. There have been some compliants about the various subplots in the film slowing down the action with exposition and I'd disagree. I found it to be a nice combination of the parranoid thrillers from the 1970's and early 80's combined with the more recent action driven ones. I suspect that those complaining about the exposition don't care for those more paranoid spy thrillers from another era.<br /><br />The one flaw with the film is that it could have been trimmed a bit but that's a minor complaint at best. The characters, acting and action sequences more than make up for a slightly bloated running time. At it's best \\"Killer Elite\\" reminds me of some of John Frankenheimer's strong later thrillers.<br /><br />The DVD looks quite nice with a solid presentation. Colors are on the cool side (and reflects the original theatrical presentation of the movie). Audio is extremely active with a nice, immersive 5.1 mix.<br /><br />It would have been nice to have a more special features such as a commentary track unfortunately all we get are 13 deleted scenes.\\" reminds me of some of John Frankenheimer's strong later thrillers.

0920668364|5.0|I thought the book had great meaning for people in meaningful loving relationships.  My girlfriend told me about it as her parents read it to her nightly as a child.  After she passed away, i read the book for the first time and was reminded on every page of things she would say to me.  It just reinforced our love and i was able to communicate to her mom what an impact it had on her life.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|Downloaded the free version of this game...loved it...had to download the full version to have more levels. And now have both my husband and daughter playing too!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is deep, but not maudlin. There is no over the top emotionality that distracts from the real, intense emotion of the characters and their story. The characters approach their situations with the humor and anger and joy and helplessness those of us familiar with the side effect of death called cancer know all too well.<br /><br />More than a coming of age or epic personal journey, Hazel and Augustus' story is a slice of life: real and raw.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Atticus O'Sullivan is a centuries old Druid who looks like a 22-year old living in Tempe, Arizona. He runs a store in the college town and lives with his Irish wolf-hound, Oberon (yes, he's named after Shakespeare's fairy king). He's living a fairly quiet existence given he's been hunted by an angry god for at least 1,000 years but has been pretty safe since he decided to make his home in Arizona.<br /><br />Now it seems his good fortune has run out as Aengus d'Og has found him and is sending emissaries to try their hand at offing him. The story doesn't lack in imagination as the assortment of foes is creative and diverse. This is Celtic mythology at its finest with Atticus in the center of gods and goddesses behaving badly, using mortals, witches and Fae to fight their political battles. The dialogue is pithy and some of the best is between Atticus and Oberon. It's impossible to know who is telling the truth, bending it a little or just flat out lying and it makes the story delicious. After awhile, I decided to just go along for the ride, enjoying some of the best writing I've read in this genre. Atticus is so interesting and his appeal is hard to define but it's there. All of the secondary characters are very well defined, provide their own intrigue and add effectively to the tale.<br /><br />I was reluctant to start this book as it didn't seem to fit my interest and now I'm thrilled that it was put in front of me by friends whose opinions I trust. This is one of the best stories I've read this year and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game. It is simple to learn with a good degree of depth on some levels. Highly recommended.
1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is an entertaining, different and very well-put-together novel and an all-around great introduction to a new author. The story is a sort-of Science Fiction/Horror/Fantasy all rolled into one and is told to great effect using mostly authentic old photographs to supplement the story by providing amazing visuals of the \\"peculiar\\" people and events of the story. It makes me wonder if the author created his story to fit the photos that he and other collectors had found or if he wrote his story and found the right pictures to fit (or some combination of the two.) Either way it made for a fascinating and fast-paced novel that I found extremely difficult to put down and I eagerly await a sequel so that I can further follow the adventures of these \\"Peculiar Children.\\"<br /><br />In terms of style, the main character and feel of the book were a bit reminiscent of Joe Hill's recent novel Horns and the style of the book did bring to mind Brian Selznick's The Invention of Hugo Cabret. However the book itself is not in any way a copy of these two works or any other. It is a wonderfully unique story and presentation that brings the characters to life in a way that most other novels do not.
B005974CNA|4.0|It was very difficult to objectively review this album. That's why I waited six months to do it because I needed time to get used to Mike Mangini at the drums instead of Mike Portnoy. I'm a big fan of Dream Theater and the departure of Portnoy was a big shock to me, so just like a lot of other fans, I first did not like this album, cause the drums sounded way too different than I was used to hearing. It took me a long time to realize that I needed to consider Dream Theater as an almost new band in order to like this album the way it should be. And I did. If, like me when I first heard it, you expect to hear in this album Portnoy's drumming style, you'll be disappointed. You'll be disappointed cause Mangini plays differently, and you'll focus so much on the drums that you won't enjoy all the beautiful music this album has to offer. It was very hard to me, as a drummer, to get rid of Portnoy's drumming style, but I managed to do it, and I since loved the album. LaBrie's singing is wonderful and some of the guitar riffs are just awesome, super technical. Each time I have listened to a new DT album, I have found a lot of guitar riffs to be so difficult in terms of time signatures, so progressive, that it took me months to understand how they worked. I felt the same with this album, trying to figure out the time signatures and technical aspects of most of the songs. And I'm still trying to figure then out! So in that sense, I found the old DT style again, and I was happy cause I love them. Of course, there is now Mangini at the drums. So it's different than before. I personally prefer Portnoy's drumming style, but that's really personal, and you might like Mangini better. Your choice ;) Mangini still plays very well in all the songs, he's very accurate, follows perfectly all the complex time signatures imposed by Petrucci's guitar riffs.<br /><br />LaBrie once said that this album sounds like their old Awake album. I think he's right, in the sense that they return to more traditional music schemes, with no 25 minute song (though I love them so much), etc. And the result is awesome. Only 4 stars out of 5 cause there are still one or two songs that I do not particular like.<br /><br />Take some time like me to really appreciate this album like it should be.nal music schemes, with no 25 minute song (though I love them so much), etc. And the result is awesome.

B0067Q42BY|1.0|This was the free app of the day, so I didn't pay for it, which is good.  I, too, waded through the ads, which I was not expecting.  Then, when I finally got to the game itself, it didn't work.  Apparently, it wasn't designed for the Fire.  I uninstalled it immediately.
B006ON41FC|5.0|You must get this game it's so fun! This is my new fave game! LOL!! COL!! FOL!! LOVE THIS GAME!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is a pretty amusing game, even though it is kind of mindless.  It is hard to beat for free, especially.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I had lots of fun playing this game I couldn't stop playing it open feint or whatever it is called was pretty annoying but it didn't bother me that much I have a kindle and the graphics were pretty good the only thing that I kind of didntvlike is as soon as you complete all the goals the game becomes without a purpose so what if you go 100000 meters or miles or ft it wont really matter it doesn't have a huge scoreboard besides open feint so it is fun for a little then it gets worthless good thing it was for free...
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game!! I cant stop playing it! My sister is always asking me if she can play it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|its a very new and different game for the kindle. it is very good however. I love how you can put the squirrel in outfits aswell.

B005M0X078|5.0|My fianc&eacute;e gave this to me on Valentine's Day and that was so sweet of her, as she knows I've been a big POTO fan for years. Strangely enough, maybe because they never performed the play here in Italy (do wonder why...), I'd never been this keen on POTO till I managed to see the lovely Joel Schumacher film version which I really liked straight away, then I fell for the London stage production me and my girlfriend attended at Her Majesty's Theatre last year and now for this gorgeously produced and staged 25th anniversary performance at the Royal Albert Hall. Too bad we couldn't be there in person, last October. Anyway watching it on DVD or bluray is already astounding!<br />At the end of the play there's a momentous finale starring most of the past and current casts which I recommend not to miss.<br />Great stage, great orchestra, great performers, great direction and cinematography and truly a great experience for all POTO fans and ALW's musicals lovers.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|With all the reviews of this game that has all these ads, I think I will pass.  I agree when you pay for an app it should come without ads. You would think they made enough at $4.99 to not need the ads.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As the book progressed I had to lay it down several times, hands shaking, heart breaking, and tears flowing. While many books has left me angry, sad, shocked, and made me throw the book across the room, Mockingjay is worse. I felt so much for the characters that the ending completely killed me. It's a difficult book to read--in more ways than one.<br /><br />While we finally get the rebellion that we have been looking forward to from the first book, it's not the glorious uprising with Katniss as the heroic leader that we expected. Because while Katniss story begins with a brave heroine sacrificing herself for her sister and overcoming obstacles, paired with a romantic love story and the hope of rebellion, it is in the end a tragedy of war. Collins paint a bleak and dystopian picture, at time almost seems to revel in the horrors--reaching an almost unbearable level at the end.<br /><br />The people of the rebellion--as well as the readers--continue to pile expectations on Katniss, the girl on fire, the face of the rebellion. But in the end she's just a seventeen year old girl, and while she is stronger than many around her, she breaks under the weight. The girl on fire is doused in the horrors of war and the fire put out; the symbolism is painfully fitting.<br /><br />The romantic plot that is so important in the previous books might seem like it's washed away in the rebellion, but it's still there--only in the guise of love. Katniss' detached personality become painfully apparent both to Peeta and to Katniss herself, but the love remains, and the fact that it's still there during the last pages of the book shows us how strong it is.<br /><br />As the lines between who is good and evil become blurred, it's Katniss who provides the moral compass throughout the chaos. I always thought one of Katniss' important strengths was her compassion, which stayed with her through so many hardships that would have burned it out for other people. Like Gale. Unlike a lot of people, I thought Gale's story felt natural, and the last breaking point between him and Katniss didn't come as a shocking surprise. He changed during the war, as his fire for revenge consumed his compassion. He is unmoved in collapsing a mountain on his enemies in an event that is comparable to the mine accidents that killed both his and Katniss' fathers, and his guilt doesn't catch up to him until one of his creations directly affects Katniss. The guilt combined with Katniss' passive accusation finally drove him away.<br /><br />I guess what I really loved about the book was all the subtlety. The writing is fast and short, and it leaves a lot up for interpretation. This together with the symbolism and foreshadowing will make me read the books again and again. Just like good, well crafted books should.<br /><br />I think it's fitting that although we can replace lost limbs and heal burned skin, what we can never heal is a broken soul. That is what the epilogue is so painful to me. Katniss and Peeta will never be the same, the people they were before the Hunger Games. This, more than everything, is the point of the series for me. \\"It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.\\"<br /><br />Although it made me cry like nothing before, I thought the end was fitting. I hated it--I just wanted everyone to be happy--but I don't think it could have turned out any other way after what happens in the books. When I finished the book I was a drained wreck, and reading discussions about the book was almost like therapy. It made me make sense of why things happened the way it did. Contemplating the book has helped overcome the grief, making sense of all the things happening.<br /><br />I could tell you what I think happened, but some walks you have to take alone.the last breaking point between him and Katniss didn't come as a shocking surprise.

B005723JSQ|5.0|I started this book wondering how Sophie Kinsella would keep me interested in something so different to the Shopoholic series, and I finished it hoping there will be a sequel! I read just about any genre of book, and there are those I skip through towards the end, those I close the last cover and think ''Glad that is finished'', those that I cannot bring myself to finish, and finally, the books that I realise I've finished before I am ready. This book was such fun, I was done with it before I was ready. I loved it!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This series is brilliant in acting and production values.  The costumes are authentic and rich.  Every detail has been attended to and the actors are superb.  I bought this series the minute it became available on Amazon.  I highly recommend it.  You can watch this several times over and you will find new details you missed.  That's how well done this series is.  There is so much nuance and detail you will find something new every time you watch it.  I had a Downton Abbey marathon last weekend and I watched all the DVDs from series one to end of series two and I can't wait for series three.  If you want to read more about them, you can always check out the Daily Mail (mailonline.com) and they have lots of articles on Downton Abbey and the cast.  Highly recommend this especially if you love the Edwardian period and the English.  Happy viewing!
B006ON41FC|5.0|when I got this game, it was free for. day. it is fun and cool! the point of view is a flying squirrel. I wouldst recommend it based on quality fun and experience.
B00275EGWY|5.0|While several veterans of the Iraq war have given it a low rating for realism, I think the film does communicate that war is hell and that war in Iraq was a special hell for the soldiers.  Of course, the plot has the usual Hollywood touches of the character being seen as a \\"cowboy\\" type, and it's hard to believe that in the real world of the military that behavior would be tolerated, but it works in the film.  I did get a sense of what it's like for the EOD to defuse a bomb and the unpredictable, and inhuman insurgents who will stop at nothing including murdering innocent men and children.  I'm glad our troops are out of that hell-hole and hope they never have to go back.  In the meantime, if you want to have an idea of what is was like for them, I highly recommend this film.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|not as bad as people say. anoing splash screen w/ads, and 2 min. tutorial to unlock all games. will try for a while. so -2 stars for what you get, so 0 for now.
B006ISJQ1W|2.0|I love Johnny Depp and will watch anything he's in.  I was so disappointed that half the movie has constant references to Nixon-Kennedy and what a bad guy Nixon was, and what a saint Kennedy was. . .the usual story-line from Hollywood.  But that said, Johnny Depp is good in this but the story is deadly boring.  I had to give up on it about half-way through.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|OfficeSuite Pro 5 is a very useful app that works well and seems well designed.  Especially useful to open and read PDF files.  Thanks for a great app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 0 it's actually a very nicely made mahjong game
B004X80QNG|1.0|Seems to be working very well so far.  No glitches or problems that I can see.  The only thing I don't like is that appointments all default to 15 minute alarm setting so I have to change every one.  15 minute notice is not enough for most people that use tool as a reminder.  It would be better if we could set a default alarm notice for all appointments to whatever we prefer...would save wasted time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i enjoy all the games and challenges.  great way to earn new games.  really wish i could get this app on a Pc
B006ON41FC|5.0|My 5 year old loves this game. Controls are easy to use, its fun, and keeps him busy while I shop, cook, or just need a few minutes.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I found this movie to be amazing and true to the book! They did a marvelous job and I believe the actors truly grew into their parts. I absolutely cannot wait for part 2 and what they do with the rest of the story!!! Simply loved the entire saga.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun very addictive .It helps pass the time when you are waiting in a doctors office for along time!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|So far this game rocks. I am a big fan of games like this so I'm happy to have it. Plus its challenging so I don't just go straight through the game. Its seriously fun.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's a good game. I like it. I've enjoyed it so far. More people should download this game. 5 star rating.
B0071QIN00|2.0|this game stinks because whenever you jump onto a corners on the wood you get stuck and you cant get out and you have to start the level all over again if you didn't get to a check point before . So don't get this app. I'd  rather go with the regular one than this one. DONT GET THIS APP.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Beautiful game. I enjoy the the story line of the quest. There is also options to play single games without doing the quest. I find the story, cut scenes, and &quot;artifacts&quot; add a fun twist to Majong.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I have a Nexus S 4G. The graphics are kind of small but there is a zoom function both for the story and the game board. The music is enjoyable.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A couple of FCs on low end phone but a nice game to spend a few minutes with here and there.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|what makes this game better than all the other mahjong games is that it has an actual storyline.  this is what an Amazon app of the day should be about! Enough with the kiddy and drawing apps.
076115678X|3.0|I'd figured out most of the info in this book on my own, years ago.  But I've been on a curly girl journey for a long time so I've had many years to experiment!  These days, it's easy enough to find sulfate free shampoos.  The botanical conditioners and alcohol-free gel, not so much.  I understand that formulations change, but a list of products that currently meet the Curly Girl criteria would be a helpful jumping off point.  The author provides a section on recipes for home made treatments.  One of them, a scrub, calls for quinoa mixed with conditioner.  How, I wonder, is one to rinse that out in the shower without totally plugging up the drain?  As another reviewer mentioned, there's an annoying amount of space devoted to personal stories and useless filler.  I could ignore these things and others if only the author had provided a list of recommended products...or a web site for an up-to-the-minute list.  Had she done that, I'd give the book 5 stars, warts and all.
B005AUWXZ0|1.0|Likely, your Child will enjoy toy cars in the bathtub more than they will this film and toys can always be played with, right? Why make the $20 investment in a movie about cars when you can buy $1 toy cars that will suffice as fun for many years to come? Just a valid thought from an avid movie-goer. I found the film pretty-yet full of dull moments. The C-word was used at least three times. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!
B002BWP49C|5.0|i couldn't believe how much the actors have grown, the picture was excellent. one of my favorite scenes was when Jacob (taylor lautner) was communicating with the rest of the wolves, i was speechless. Overall it was the best of the saga not only the actors did an amazing Job, the director was a excellent chosen.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book definately kept me on my toes. The concept and idea is extremely unique and kept me interested and guessing all the way through. You will definately not be disappointed!!:)
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this was a free app, but would have been worth the regular price. It is a typical. mahjong game with the added benefit of an adventure game to keep you playing.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I literaly just finished this book a few minutes ago...and Im amazed. This book will steal your heart away from the get go. You will, no doubt, fall in love with the characters, and wont be able to put it down until you finish...its just that good. Just a warning, you will fall in love, and then get your heart broken. My mind is seriously blown away.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love It Love It Love It Love It I love this game so much I love it so much I recommend it
B0078KDD7M|5.0|SKIN DEEP, episode 12,  is the best episode yet of this show!  I like ONCE a lot, but the pacing can feel slow and usually any story not involving Snow White is boring, BUT Rumpelstiltskin is always a highlight. With him featured center stage in the retelling of Beauty and the Beast, it has everything I tune in to this show for - romance, unique takes on classic tales, and interesting characters.  The princes and most of the princess always seem so bland, so I can't help but love the nuanced Rumpelstiltskin.  I was growing tired of Prince Charming cheating on his wife, Emma and the Queen having cat fights at every turn, and the plot NEVER moving forward, so I feared this show had almost run its course and then THIS EPISODE happens and I'm totally back on board.  Nicely done, but it's written by jane espenson, who I just discovered wrote half of all the television I like, so I shouldn't be surprised.  Episodes 6 and 7 are good too, but there needs to be more like ep 12!  I watched them all air, but this is the only ep I've bought. I can't stop thinking about it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great end to the trilogy. Captivating story, well written, great characters. Hope the movies are half as good. Reading it for the third time now.
B0063GORYU|5.0|super addicting and challenging. I cannot seem to put it down until I get that telltale hand cramp. you will love it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I played this on my computer &amp; was excited. to find it for my Kindle Fire.  it is as good as computer. would recommend. it for sure
B0067Q42BY|4.0|The game has great graphics and a fun story line that is a little cheesy.  There is a great tutorial.  If you are a serious Mahjong player, it is a little bit easy, at least at first. Overral a good time!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I'm a freaking beast at the game, blab zhsus Isbsheu siebjsbsh sjsishsush Susie sbsjsj sjsjshsj sjsjsisis sisisbsus djsjsi snsnisj sis.sis
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I just downloaded this game, and I must say it is quite entertaining. The gameplay is awesome and the story line is pretty neat. Also, the puzzles are easy at first but they begin to become harder after you complete some of the easier problems which I like :-) Definently a game worth trying and get it while it's free!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is awesome and spectacular. It has been freezing a little, but other than that it is magnificent! !!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|works great on my fire. have only had this game for a day but I'm solo hooked. recommended to all with the fire.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is a fun matching game. I love the auto zoom feature. Beautiful background and tiles too. Was a good purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the games but need more games to chose. from that way everybody will have more fun and more games to chose.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is quite addicting. My daughter also loves this game. I think that there should be harder levels though.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Excelente aplicacion...para mi es la mejor de au clase y la recomiendo 100%. La uso tanto en mi computador como en la tablet. Para mi es sencillamente imprescindible.
B004I744AS|5.0|I was very impressed with this app.  its a keeper its interesting to go thru the various subject. matter. they have available
0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed the book all in all couldn't put it down at night. The plot was great. A profound theme. Had enjoyed getting to know numerous tibits of histories of art, architecture, and D.C. Though I must say the last chapter or so gave me a yawn, even the message was a powerful one.  It had exceeded beyond my expectation given the phenonemonal success of Da Vinci Code.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|ive played better,but not for free. if it wasn't the free app of the day Id return it. but ill play it now.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I was thrilled this app worked on my kindle fire; I'd download a pdf from a website but couldn't seem to return to it if I navigated away, so kept having to redownload the pdf.  But downloaded the adobe app and bam, there were the (tons of repeated) pdf downloads neatly listed lol.  So how to erase all the duplicates? will this eat up my kindle space...time will tell.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great camera backpack.  It is large and well-made.  In fact, the backpack was too large for my purposes and I returned.  Very impressed with quality though and all the pockets for the cost.  If you need a large, backpack-style camera bag, give this one a try.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Nice app so far... Just starting but looks great on kindle fire... Watching for ads which will make it go bad fast!
1451627289|4.0|I haven't read any of Stephen Kings usual books, because every attempt made me put them down - the gore just isn't for me. However, due to the premise of this book, I picked it up and read it in 2 days! It's interesting, a good read, doesn't get into the usual theories of the Kennedy assassination. The reason I gave it 4 instead 5 stars is that the ending did not play for me - it was getting into the scary/gory/don't want to know details, which I associate with 'typical' King stories. Also, I agree with the assessment of Dallas - don't like it, it has a dark vibe. I'm going to try another S.K. book, soon!
1595827684|5.0|Not only is the art extraordinary but the accompanying text peels back the layers to explain the thinking behind the design work. A worthy gift for any friends that enjoy the series or just enjoy rich, detailed sci-fi universes in general. A must buy for the hardcore fan who wants to put their favorite game on display for anyone to see.<br /><br />P.S. Don't dig into the Mass Effect 3 section before playing the new game unless you want MAJOR spoilers, particularly for characters.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|WOW!!!!!! As a long time fan of Epica, Nightwish and Kamelot I was blown away by this album. By far the BEST of it's kind. Not a skip song to be found. I don't need to detail this as enough have already done. I just got to give it props! AMAZING piece of recorded work! Buy it now! The dvd is awesome as well!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This app is awesome. The store is good and who doesn't like a good game of mahjong. Perfect for my Kindle Fire
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I am an avid fan of the extreme and a certified gorehound. I am sick of reading how this film makes any political statement whatsoever. It has NO meaning at all! It is celluloid garbage. In a word? Perversion. Simple. I give it one star because of it's shock value for 1975. That's it. Cannibal Holocaust had WAY more social meaning than this! At least we never have to ingest anything else from it's overrated director.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I was about to get the app when I found out about the ads. Don't get it its a waste of time.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|seems fun so far.  and I don't mind the adds for the developers other games.  I find it funny that the person complaining about it got it as a free app.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is great! It shows the person, the human Steve Jobs. The good things, the bad things... the victories and the mistakes in business and in private life. Reccomend to anyone who is looking for some inspiration and looking to find a place in own life.
1451627289|1.0|Much of this book is just plain silly.  Ridiculous is the word.  And the author's political bias shows through in almost every detail about politics.  Not to mention his feelings about Texas, and, as he frequently calls them, \\"rednecks.\\" .  And to cap it all off, his paradise ending has Hillary Clinton now as president, if JFK's assassination had not come to be.  Wow, what a visionary!
B0030IIZ56|1.0|Received this yesterday and upon opening the Blu-Ray case found the DVD disc was broken with only half of the disc in it.  Also many finger prints on the surface of the Blu-ray disk.  Also, non-factory shrink wrap, cardboard sleeve was no longer glued together on the edge.  Large yellow sticker with UPC and various other numbers on the case.  Missing all Disney literature that should have been inside, including the Disney Rewards code.  Obviously not new, definitely used or ??  I have requested a return of this inferior item and Amazon is shipping me a replacement.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Sure, the ads between games are a little annoying, but the app was free. I had this game on my iphone, and it did the same thing so I was used to it
B0067Q42BY|2.0|with my htc sensation, it doesn't use the whole screen, instead there are black borders around the game screen.  And the ads on the splash screen is so annoying, I am sticking with random mahjong
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great version, keeps you interested. Nice options to play with the story, or without. Didn't have any trouble with installation or ads.  Will definitely keep playing.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've never played mahjong before but found this very easy to learn and start playing after a 30 second tutorial. Also looks great on my kindle fire.
B004UID2LC|5.0|When I got my Fire, I had a few things i wanted it to do. The main thing was offline video playback. This app does that. I use it almost constantly and my kindle is full to bursting with bids to show my friends. The abillity to download in MP3 and then listen from the built in player is just as great. I recommend this app to all my friends and all Fire users. I LOVE this app.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The DVD arrived prompty, as is usual with Amazon, and we very much enjoyed the movie \\"Courageous\\".  There is a little bit of everything in it, except bare skin and vulgar language.  Produced by a Baptist Church in Georgia (the same folks who made \\"Facing the Giants\\" and \\"Fireproof\\")as a sort of Christian sermon/life lesson/entertainment combination, this movie has better production values than previous films (which we also enjoyed).  The story lines are well defined, the characters are compelling, and the messages are presented clearly without being oppressive.  This is a family-friendly production that may give the viewer something to think about.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun game.  always loved mahjong on PC. now I have a real good version for mobile. Great free app of the day.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong at its best with a storyline to put the cherry on top a must have for any mahjong lover and newcomer.
B000VS6QTK|5.0|Holy cow is this a good concert! I was never really that much of an AC/DC fan but have always been into concert DVDs and blu-rays. I rented an AC/DC blu-ray from NETFLIX and LOVED it. What a time! The one I rented wasn't this one but it was also very enjoyable and this particular blu-ray just rocks from start to finish. Sound quality is awesome and if you've got the system, it'll be just like being there. The video quality is also very good considering the age of the footage and the music is just as it should be, ROCK at it's best.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Really fun game. Its easier  than others i have played. I like the tutorial, it helps to get started and know all of the tiles so u don't get stuck on your first puzzle l. insure it will ge mire challenging.
B002LB7S10|4.0|Not for young children! This a good plot, but a very scary movie...some sexuality, language, suspense, a little gore. An outright creepy movie. I only watched it once or twice--once you've seen the ending, it's just not as good (like with all scary movies!) Good for Halloween or watching in the dark (but not alone of course). Not the absolute best scary movie I've ever seen, but it's up there.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I also am glad I did not listen to some of the reviews.  Its easy to play. Try it you will be pleased.
0553269631|5.0|I have just read this novel for our book group and found it one of the most achingly sad and beautiful books I have been privileged to read.  McCullers youth when she wrote this novel makes her insights all the more extraordinary.  That she was writing well before the civil rights movement impacted on the consciousness of Anglo Americans makes the Heart is a Lonely Hunter an amazing achievement.  One hopes it also made and continues to make a contribution to challenging racism, attitudes to people with disabilities and the existence of grim poverty in the daily lives of people living in so called civilised societies.  I grew to understand all of her characters and her development of both the characters and her narrative was strong, kind and honest. Her central character, Singer, and his love for his friend, was depicted with great tenderness. The gritty sadness and strength of the other characters left me feeling touched by their lives as if they were my neighbors.  It is on the reading list for some final year high school students one state in my country - a moving and engaging read from page one.
B001EWFIQO|5.0|THIS IS A LIVE PERFORMANCE RECORDING.UNBELIEVEABLE. THIS LP IS A RARE FIND.ESPECIALLY IN MINT CONDITION.IF YOU ARE A CLAPTON FAN THIS SHOULDN'T BE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO YOUR EARS.
B005UKJX4E|3.0|Beautifully written and acted film.  The only way I could watch this film was to take notes on my tablet to keep me focused and following the sometimes mysterious dialogue.  I cannot imagine having lasted sitting through this in the movie theater.  The director needed to have resisted the urge to show us every example of circles in nature.  The dinosaur scene was unrealistic.  The reptilian bird definitely would have eaten that vulnerable dinosaur baby it grabbed by the neck.  I would have liked to have seen the Sean Penn character's current life fleshed out a bit more.  We looked back but its not specifically clear, why we did.  Why does it matter that Sean glanced at the blonde woman who walked by?
B006TXDOZ0|5.0|just received my copy from amazon yesterday and copying the first review this is awsome.the only problem i seem to be having is trying to listen to something else,this is just too good to take off.it might be a little softer than their first album but the melodies are great.
B006ON41FC|5.0|so cute and fun and strangely adicting. u should for surely get this and u wont regret it at all. no need to worry! only. one buck!
1593553307|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it.  He has a long ride to work so he would listen to it to and from work, but he loved it so much he would actually bring it inside at night so he could continue listening at home.  It was suspenseful but funny at times.  He was really happy with it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its pretty nice if you ask me! Really entertaining if you have nothing else to do! Go ahead download it, you have nothing to lose?(:
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun, easy to grasp.  Legal tiles are clearly highlighted.  background music is low-key.  Storyline is not necessary, but, adds color
B006ON41FC|5.0|love it!!!!! works well on kindle fire. great graphics and ideas. the shop part is really neat. PERFECT app of the day or paid version
B004WR125O|4.0|I purchased this for a relatives Onkyo receiver. It works just fine as long as you are not too far away from your wireless router. The TP-Link wireless USB adapter with antenna has better range, but it is noticeable sticking out of the front of the receiver. The Onkyo UWF-1 Wireless LAN Adapter is not noticeable which is good. I recommend this, but first consider where your receiver is in correlation to your wireless router.
B004QK5N5W|3.0|I tested this cable as soon as I got it. I can watch youtube and videos in my iphone 4. The only app that I can actually use is netflix. I tried HuluPlus, TBS and HBOGo, and all I got was audio. I returned it the same day because of the limitations, which I think are most likely from apple and not from the cable itself. I have a laptop with an HDMI that actually mirrors the screen, and is not as restrictive as the iOS products I own.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I tried to download the updated version of it, but its still downloading 10 hours later!  And I don't know why.
0446571415|1.0|This book could have been written by six or eight unrelated authors who, alternating chapter by chapter, each advanced their own idea which way it should go. Improbable to say the least and worse yet it was just plain boring and very hard to finish.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Wow!  I wanted to turn it off within 15 mins.  My husband made me watch the whole movie. What a huge waste of time. I am a huge Brad Pitt fan, but this is garbage.  If I could have given it 0 stars I would have!
0743457900|1.0|Before I saw the movie I thought it prudent to read the book.  Bought it on kindle and started in....Forced myself to keep reading, hoping I would figure out the plot, characters, setting, etc.  I am 65 years of age and have always been an avid reader, especially of spy thrillers.  It was not a thriller. It was more of a \\"What the heck?\\"  I have to say that I have never read a more uninteresting book.  Instead of not being able to put it down, I forced myself to pick it up, just to get it over with it.<br /><br />Anyway, I will not be seeing the movie. The book was terrible.
B004EPZ03O|3.0|I originally took the stand that I would not see this film until DIsney decided to make Seasons 4 and 5 of The Muppet Show available on DVD. Since then, someone else in my household rented the film on Netflix and so I did get to see it. What a disappointment. The premise that a Muppet character, such as Walter, could be born into a human family is just a bit too hard to swallow. It reminded me of the joke in The Great Muppet Caper in which Kermit and Fozzie are supposed to be brothers - which is helped when you see that their father was a composite of both characters. At least that was plausible in a way this was not. I'm also one of those who find the voices of the characters too different from the old days. Kermit and Piggy are alright and Gonzo is still Gonzo, but Stadler and Waldorf, two of my oldest favorites, just don't sound like themselves anymore. They're supposed to be crotchety old men but they sound like middle-aged goons. I also had trouble believing that Uncle Deadly, villainous though he is, would be willing to even consider selling the Muppet Theatre - he's The Phantom of the Muppet Show, for crying out loud! There, I've done it. Treating Muppets like real people. The truth is that to people like me, they do have a real existence which was part of their charm. At least we got a bit of the real old Muppet Show with the telethon sequence, which was just too short. Though it was a fun idea, I thought it was just too cruel to take Animal's drums away for most of the film.<br />On a final note, one reason I found the voices so jarring was that they were even different from the ones in the recent vignettes to be found on YouTube. Any one of these is more like the classic Muppets than this film. I recommend the Swedish Chef bits \\"Popcorn\\" and \\"Pumpkin Pie\\", \\"Habanera\\" from Carmen, \\"Carol of the Bells\\" with Beeker, Animal and others, and the fantastic rendering of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" featuring the original musical track produced by Queen. THIS is what the Muppets are really about.<br />By the way, even though I really don't like the movie, I do like the new character of Walter. He's very much reminiscent of my inner child and after all, he did make a plea for Disney to release the final two seasons of the old Muppet Show. He's a solid Muppet character.
B0043ISH6O|2.0|Ok, frankly, I was expecting a whole lot more than this. This wasn't very good at all. Not one song really stood out. Not one. TR has some good stuff, but, this one is taking the Browns to the Superbowl. Atticus Ross should make another 12 Rounds album. Or, do stuff on his own. His work on The Book of Eli was very good. It could have been better, but, that soundtrack was FAR SUPERIOR to this overrated hack. Why they even were nominated for an award for this is simply for the name. By listening to this, makes me wary of listening to the Dragon Tattoo thing.
0307949486|2.0|The first half of the book was wonderful and being Swedish I was right at home with the locations and culture, the coffee, the sandwiches, the snow, the scenery.  Loved it.  Also, the Mystery and the History were wonderful, and THEN it disenteregrated into absolute gore and sadism.  T.M.I. about sadistic humans.  Then, the very end of the book was the solution.  But, still why degenerate into such gore that I had nightmares for days?  WE GET IT.  WE HAVE IMAGINATION, WE DON'T NEED DETAILED GORE!  If anybody our there knows of a MYSTERY, not a GORE MYSTERY, please post it!<br />If you can read just until the gore starts, then skip to the last 20 pages of so, you might enjoy.
B006ON41FC|5.0|i think that going nuts is my top game. everyone that i know just loves it!!!its also fun for all ages
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game when I have a few minutes to wait because it's the classic solitaire game and easy to take jp where I leave off.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|If viewers are looking for a shorter film version of Bronte's classic, then this adaptation is a good one. It comes in around 120 minutes. The settings and costumes are wonderful. A few of the scenes go deeper, darker, than previous film versions and I liked that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Jane Eyre is not the type of story you should experience in an abridged manner.<br /><br />** Slight spoiler alert **<br /><br />There are many, many things that should not be missed. Some of the items deleted from this movie were - Grace Poole, key lines and interactions between Mr. Rochester and Jane, the gypsy scene, and St. John's love interest, Rosamund.<br /><br />The acting was also a little awkward. The tender scenes between the two love birds left me feeling uncomfortable and hoping for a second take. Also - Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender do not fit the description of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Key elements of the classic story are Jane's slightly homily face and Rochester's savage looks. The two actors picked were far too pleasant to fall into either of these categories.<br /><br />To get a better idea of the classic story, I suggest you watch [[ASIN:B000LPQ6DE Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre]]. If you are looking to get the true message and effect of this wonderful but tragic love story, read the novel.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I don't see a problem with ads.  When you start you have ad ad page, that isn't so bad as they are small.  Just click on play to get to the main menu.  Then no more ads.  There is a please rate use that pops up once later.  As for rating this low because of ads, serriously think about it.  People pay money for movies that they like but have ads in them.  You might say what ads, well have you heard of product placement?  Even major video games have product placement.  I won't rate this app down just for a simple ad that isn't intrusive.  Although they do bother me a tiny bit.  Bigger issues are with the game.  The game has a lot of options and many different pieces that have special powers.  These you don't see in normal mahjong.  Which is great, and the many modes are also really nice.  I did get confused on one special piece though, but figured it out.  For classic mode you can pick different layouts and different piece sets.  Nice.  For quest mode you only get the Chinese piece set.  I really wish there was a more international piece mode.  The pieces have Chinese characters on some pieces, and some look very similar because of this.  I would also say this makes it kid unfriendly.  In fact it might be nice to have a different quest for each piece set.  Then have a special bonus if you get all quests done.  Also would suggest you remind people that they don't need to use shuffle to complete a puzzle.  I assume this is true.  Also keep track of which ones they used shuffle on, as it really makes it too easy.  For mahjong, this is the best version I have tried, highly recommend.  Puzzle lovers might like it although the shuffle make it too easy.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great on Kindle Fire! I'm glad that it was the app of the day. I'm too cheap to pay five bucks for an app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|well done.  nice graphics and smooth play.  I enjoy learning and playing it.  blah blah blah and so forth and so on.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is an excellent time waster.  you can hand it to older children and the puzzle and story will occupy them for many hours
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun, it makes up for the games like this they don't have. I love this game. so much fun!
0525423656|4.0|Cassia is finally going to find Ky.  After moving from work camp to work camp for months she is Society is moving her and a group of girls out to the Outer Provinces where Ky is...somewhere.  Ky has been in the Out Provinces for months watching young men, if you can call them that, die daily at the hand of the enemy or maybe it's really at the hand of Society.  The Society is sticking noncitizens in the Outer Provinces to distract the enemy and keep them at bay.  But they're running out of noncitizens and have resulted to shipping out boys as young as thirteen and now girls.  Which is how Cassia is moved to the Outer Provinces, but it's too late, Ky has already left the camp.  She has two options, to stay and be killed by the rebels or to risk being caught and killed by society? Crossed is the sequel to the dystopian novel Matched, that will leave you dying for more.  Something that I really liked about Crossed was that you get to see from Ky's point of view as well as Cassia's.  There's also a slight game changer in the plot at the end of the book that really throws you for a loop and leaves you dying to know what will happen in the third/ final installment of the Matched series.  I didn't quite enjoy this book as much as the first one.  The plot didn't quite hold my attention as much as the first book because it didn't twist and change throughout the entire book.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This app was free but it would be worth the money as it has a nice gameplay to it.  I'm playing it on a kindle fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is truly the best. Bible app I've seen. It has many  translations and reading plans. And easy to get to scripture. Thanks for this really great app!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun.. easy to play. could be great for any age. will recommend to friends who are looking for a great way to pass time.
B005J7K950|3.0|I only could see that film on my PC. My french scope is not compatible. I was asked for a code...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using Youversion for several months now and have found it to be a great tool for reading God's Word. Easy to get around in so if our pastor is using more than one passage of scripture I can stay with him. it is also easy to switch versions which is great because I like to read from the NLT and he preaches from the NIV. Also the NLT comes with an audible version that is read by a real person and not a computer generated voice which makes it easy to follow while walking on a treadmill.  finally it comes with several devotionals which is really nice when you don't have a lot of time.  Get the app, you will enjoy it!

B0073PQ720|1.0|This is my very first review.  I could not help my urgent desire to warn all who may be   wondering whether or not  to watch this movie.  It was a joke!!!!  I would have been so angry if I had seen this movie in a Theatre  and paid the usual movie fare.  Just spending 4.99, was hurtful enough; not to mention the time I wasted.  The attempt was made to blend an indie type vibe with just enough gore and high speed car chases to try and appeal to a mass audience.  There was no acting in this movie by the two main characters, and all of the pauses and silence between them was so contrived.  The violence strewn throughout the movie was obviously the writer and producers proudest moments.  The attempt at making Gosling's character \\"mysterious\\" just fell short with a quick realization that he's basically a loner with an obvious violent past as we see just how violent he can be.  We are supposed to feel what exactly in this movie?? I felt disgusted and ripped off, and it's unbelievable the reviewers who give this movie \\"glowing\\" reviews!! You will feel duped until the ending, where you just feel anger at all who were involved in the making of this disaster called \\"cinema.\\"  Not to mention extreme disappointment at the A-list actors who thought they could bring something to this horrible, horrible movie; but even great actors couldn't make this movie worth your time and money. I urge you to watch another movie tonight.  You won't be disappointed by my advice, but certainly will be disappointed if you watch this movie!
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is a great Van Halen cd. It sounds like it was recorded in a cardboard box. This is the worst sounding cd Van Halen ever recorded to date. it's compressed to death and clips out. Tattoo is from the demo of Down In Flames, Shes The Women is from the demo of Shes The Woman, Big River is from the demo of Big Trouble, Beats Workin' is from the demo Put Out The Lights. They rock the crab out of them. A GREAT CD. ALL VAN HALEN FANS WILL ENJOY THIS ROCKIN CD I Like It.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a blessing to have this application for free since bibles are so expensive.  This even gives reading plans and reminders.  I love it and thank you!

081297381X|2.0|Taleb spends roughly 300 pompous pages describing a few interesting and valid ideas about randomness (what you dont know may hurt you, not everything follows a normal distribution, etc). Unfortunately he wraps up the book by disqualifying and invalidating  a large portion of established mathematical, statistical and economic research. He fails to acknowledge that most of reality IS normal, and that most of econometrical theory was not developed originally to deal with the eccentricities of financial analysts, who actually CREATE most of the artificial black swans of todays age.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|decent games for free. ads are annoying but hey, it's free. good time killer. gives you more points for writing a reveiw
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Really enjoy this app, play it all the time. I would recommend this game to anyone that loves to play Mahjong.
1926778103|2.0|I can ignore the terrible binding job since I use these books a lot and they get pretty roughed up but this book's layout is horrid. The art is amazing and there is tons of it. So much so that in many cases they decided to make the pictures tiny and put a bunch of them on a single page. Honestly this book would have been twice as good even if it were half the size if all they did was put the best pictures one per page. Having a million amazing and tiny pictures crammed on the page is useless to me. Want a good art book? Go buy massive black.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|**JUST A WARNING! I MIGHT SLIP OUT SOME SPOILERS** Anyway! This book is amazing! I'm 14 and go to a school where people read these genre of books alot I thought it would be dumb when my friends kept telling me about it and bugging me to read it, but when I finally read it I couldn't believe how much I loved this book! It's one of those storys you can NEVER put down! The story line for this book is something all teens WANT to read! A girl who saves her sister from going into a game to certain death, fighting strangers bigger then her in near death situations, and all of that packed in with cliffhangers! A good book only needs good cliffhangers, Characters you can connect with and Awesomeness, to be a best seller! Which is what you get with this book. When I first got the book the first thing I did was sit down and read, then I read some while eating, then read some more! I couldn't put it down! And the end of each book makes you want the next book in your hands straight away! 500/5 for this book! You won't be disapointed:D
B00338QENI|3.0|No doubt, this is an interesting book.  I was really amazed by all that I learned in this book. I had never heard of HeLa cells before, nor Henrietta Lacks.  That's probably because I'm not into biology...yet, HeLa cells were and still are a huge part of our advancement in medicine.  We should all know what Henrietta's cells did for us.  If you're up for learning something on the topic of cell research, check this book out. For my full review visit my book review website.  [...]

0321701763|1.0|Despite being designated as the 'official training workbook' for Adobe Photoshop CS5, this book is perhaps the best example of how NOT to write an instructional text on Photoshop CS5. The biggest fault in 'Classroom in a Book' is with the method in which material is presented. This book is neither a detailed primer on Photoshop tools/techniques (like Martin Evening's books), nor a practical guide on real-world post-processing or retouching techniques (like Scott Kelby's books).<br /><br />Like Kelby's book, you'll find that this book is mostly structured as a set of very prescriptive step-by-step instructions to perform a specific task. However, the exercises in this book are often contrived, and in many cases lack practical value. In fact, instead of being a training manual, this book feels more like a laboratory guide for beta-testers that are being asked to tour through specific features of the product.<br /><br />You will notice this style right from the very beginning. For example, many example exercises have the reader start Photoshop holding down the special control sequence to clear settings (and this instruction is repeated over and over throughout the book). In addition, instead of just focusing on techniques designed for one audience, there is somewhat random selection of techniques covered which vary from those useful to digital photographers, to those used by designers or graphic artists. Sadly, there isn't enough depth for any one of those audiences to really learn enough to be useful.<br /><br />Those new to Photoshop (which this book tries to cater towards), will likely come away very frustrated with not only the poor organization of material in the book, but also the frequent lack of satisfactory explanations of what particular tools/techniques actually do. For example, as early as page 21, the book walks you through creating a curves adjustment layer (which really deserves its own chapter!) and just tells the reader to click on specific icons and enter specific values and 'notice the results', without explaining what really happened.<br /><br />At best, readers of this book will only be left with a superficial idea of what Photoshop CS5 is really capable of, and no real understanding of how or why to use particular tools/techniques. It is really baffling to me who would find value in a book like this. Neither inspiring, nor educational, this book fails spectacularly in educating the reader on how to use this very complex product. Not recommended.ce the results', without explaining what really happened.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|awesome that's what it is. It's cool how it has comics in it and one of my favorite games mohjong all in one!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is soooooo much fun!(besides the pop up for the rating)this game is the best!I think that this game is the best downloade
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong is really fun who cares about ads I haven't seen any in this game what's up with the reviews get over it you babies.
B006ON41FC|5.0|the gameplay is great in going nuts I love the fact its 3d and you can buy stuff if you like to dodge stuff this is the game for you
B006ON41FC|5.0|I have over 100 apps and this is on my top 4. it has great graphics and a cool and orgional concept.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love Mahjong when I first saw my dad play it I was amazed by the puzzles it the best puzzle game ever and I don't like puzzle games except this thanks Mahjong makers
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game would get a solid 5-star review if not for the mandatory ads you must click through to get to the paid version of game. Otherwise, this game has great graphics, solid gameplay, and an entertaining story.
B005HSL626|5.0|I believe after playing this that I could be a real fruit ninja!!! I love fruit ninja so much!!! you will to!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun variation of mahjong. A bit small on the thunderbolt but still playable. Would be better on a larger screen.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|First off, this works perfect on the Kindle Fire. Secondly, I found ONLY ONE PAGE OF ADS THAT I WOULD CALL THE START SCREEN on other PAID games and software apps that I have used before. This is a wonderful game that I highly recommend. Don't discriminate on such trivial grounds!!!!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Overall I like this game. I do wish the undo button wasn't at the same place on the screen but I do like that you can undo anything including deals.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game, forgot how much I liked Mahjong.  As for the ads...&quot;wade through&quot;?  Seriously?  A little exaggerated I think.  It's one screen with a single button to go right on in....not like you have to close Feint or something similar....which IS annoying and not part of this app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Quality mahjong game in classic mode and the story mode adds enough of a twist to separate it from others I have played.
B006ON41FC|5.0|addictive. fun. nuff said. oh. guess not. I need to say more. you're a flying squirrel. you connect nuts. its fun. buy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|when i first got the game i was bored with it then i played it a few times, it got really, really fun!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Personally, if this wasn't free today, I probably would have paid for it later. I love this game. Mahjong Artifacts is a Mahjong game with superior control quality and a beautiful Asian theme that looks incredible on the Kindle fire. I don't even mind that the game producer advertises other games.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so simple but can be very difficult I love it. Let's put the watermelon on top of the eggs that should be ok right.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game held my attention, (60 yr old), my 30 something son, grand daughters ages 5&amp;7. looks ezy but very challenging!
B004T6A3SK|5.0|I borrowed The \\"Outlander\\" from my sister in law a few months ago, having run out of new interesting books. I was a little reluctant at first since its set in the 1700's/ early 1900's. I am HOOKED!!! After the first i borrowed the second \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\", also awesome! Then i bought the third \\"Voyager\\". I am in the middle of the forth, \\"Drums of Autumn\\", and i am a few short seconds away from buying the fifth...\\"Fiery Cross\\". Diana Gabaldon is the author , honestly i have never heard of her before but she is AMAZING at bringing these characters, and the settings to life. Its a mix of interesting mysteriousness, romanticism, shocking, action, at at times hilarious!! Everything from time travel, witchcraft, war, & family. WONDERFUL LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! CANT GET ENOUGH I almost hate to finish the series i think ill be lost without Jamie and Claire. Diana...we need another series PLEASE!:)
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is by far the best workout video I have ever done. I used to work out at the gym anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. With this video, I am feeling the same results from the 25 minute workout. I absolutely love it. For all of the people saying that this video is hard on their knees, it's because they are doing the workouts wrong. Jillian reminds you many times throughout the video how to do the workouts correctly so that you are not damaging your knees. If you do the workouts as she instructs, you will have no problems. This video is definitely worth the money hands down.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love mahjong and its free. You cant beat that. Ive got quite a few apps for free that were worth waiting for. Patience is a vertue.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This was one of the first novels I read by Picoult and it hooked me! I have been a huge fan of her writing ever since. One of my favorite books of all time, she does an amazing job of keeping you guessing and wondering until the very last second when she drops the bomb on you. This story of love, loss, friendship and survival will keep you on the edge of your seat and turning the page until its over.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Real fun game, takes 1 or 2 tries to learn how to play it. Great for all ages, really would recommend it
B006ON41FC|5.0|IT IS AWESOME HAS LOTS OF ACTION. I AM NUTS FOR GOING NUTS. SO MUCH FUN MY SISTER HAD TO TURN OFF MY KINDLE TO GET ME TO STOP PLAYING.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a good game I sit up and play it for hours. my gf yells at me cause I play to late
B0067Q42BY|4.0|On this game I get two in one. I get a great puzzle and a comic. Two things I love. :-)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am very happy with this version of THE HOLY BIBLE I am able to follow with any version my pastor is reading from. All the features available make my studies go well.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder, though taking the barest semblest of the the tale of Cinderella is actually a well written novel of political intrigue, racism and young impossible romance (okay there is where the Cinderella tie in is) that moves along at a surprising clip. Well written, well plotted and you will absolutely be cheering for the unlikely hero Cinder to come through. She is one teenage cyborg who doesn't need a prince to save her, though she wouldn't mind a little royal help!  Cinder is good example that some of the best reading to be found is in young adult fiction!
B006O5Y0SS|1.0|I'm sorry.  I just didn't like this movie.  It was far-fetched.  Going back in time and meeting Hemingway for instance.  Hemingway didn't seem true to life.  And fitting Hemingway into your own writing didn't seem right either.  I was bummed.  I like Owen Wilson.  I like Rachel Adams.  Perhaps in another time I would like this movie, but not this time.  Sorry
B006ON41FC|5.0|Very fun and addictive game. Its a fun game for everyone, any age. You feel yourself playing it over and over again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great. If I want to take a break from reading, I always go to the old favorite. Sure beats breaking out a deck of cards on the train. A perfect time killer.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Paid apps should not have ads, even if they are just for the Devs other apps. Regardless of the game quality itself, or any originality, there is no excuse for ads in a paid app.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I'm a true fan of Josh Groban. I'm truly in love with this album. I've got every single CD he has made except 'A Collection'. That's the only one I would love to own. However, My parents had gotten me to see him live for the very first time last year and he was amazing as he is on this CD. My favorite songs  I've listened to repeatedly were \\"Higher Window\\" \\"Hidden Away\\" \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\" and \\"War at Home\\" . Josh Groban has a magnificent voice and I cannot stop listening to him. I'm only twenty one years old and he's fabulous. I listen to him at night as well when I can't decide on what to listen to. He's truly amazing. <3
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Woody Allen's \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a sweet and charming examination of romance--not only romance of the heart but also romance for the past. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a hack Hollywood screenwriter who longs to write serious literature. He and his fianc&eacute;e, played by Rachel McAdams, are visiting Paris to spend some time with her parents before they get married. Gil obviously adores Paris--as does Allen, who shoots it as lovingly as he shoots his own beloved Manhattan--and wonders whether he and his fianc&eacute;e should move there permanently. As he escapes his insufferable soon-to-be in-laws, Gil stumbles upon the Paris of the past he has romanticized so thoroughly and encounters F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, and a host of other literary and artistic figures. He falls for the lovely Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard, and he is ultimately forced to reconcile his romances with his reality. Allen's script is, as we have come to expect, witty and insightful and intelligent, and the film itself will win you over with its charm and its honesty.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|the first levels of the game work great. But as you advance to the third level of the game, rotation controls are needed.... and that's where the game doesn't shine--- you will find yourself frustrated you cannot rotate the items-- sometimes work sometimes it does not.....HTC evo 3d ...<br /><br /> overall the game is great, but unless the rotation controls are fixed it's not worth playing pass the second level
B006H3MIV8|4.0|The idea for this four-disc set was to serve two main purposes: First, to celebrate the 70th birthday of one of America's truly legendary poets: Singer/songwriter/musician Bob Dylan. Next it would act as a benefit album for Amnesty International.. And, yes, it served both of those purposes as it was released. But, while the producers of the package wanted to show the breadth of Dylan's music, and how many ways it could be performed, I think they missed the boat here. Among the nearly 100 performances of Dylan compositions are artists who everyone knows (Adele, Joan Baez, Pete Townshend, and Sting), some who are less universally well-known (My Chemical Romance, Kronos Quartet, and Michael Franti) an many who were completely new to me (and, I think, the typical Dylan fan) such as Charlie Winston, Outernational, Thea Gilmore and Jack's Mannequin. This last named group of artists could get exposure from the collection but there are no artist bios, let alone actual liner notes in the set, Just a list of the songs and performers and a short essay on Amnesty's connection with Dylan.<br /><br />I'll leave the other more-detailed reviews to provide you with track lists, etc.<br /><br />So, while I enjoyed most of the performances - some more creative than others - I felt the project was only half-completed. I'll still recommend it, but only wish the producers went that extra step.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

B006FE83V8|5.0|NOTE: This review is based on the 2012 Blu-ray Collectors' Edition Combo. Amazon has an odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a movie that is released on home video. So, to make the most use of the hundreds of reviews listed for TKAM, click on the \\"show all reviews\\" link and then sort by \\"Newest First\\". Then look at date of the review. Now on to my review:<br /><br />First off, I've always loved this film and it was the story, acting and the photography that always captured me since I saw the film when it was released. It was in black and white (and growing up we only had a black and white TV, so I was used to this). The film looked \\"okay\\" on VHS and then, in 1998 Universal released it on DVD in a Collector's Edition. This included the film plus a full length commentary and the (then) new feature-length documentary. This was great.. but the film had not been \\"restored\\".<br /><br />Now Universal has restored it and the print is great. They brought back the above noted bonus features and added more! The bonuses amount to more viewing time than the feature film (almost four times!). The DVD version of the new release contains all the featurettes while the Blu-ray combo pack Collectors' Edition ads the book with rare photos etc and high-def of the special features. So if you don't have a BD player yet you won't miss out on the wonderful special features. And if you have not seen the documentary before, it will blow you away. (By the way, after you've absorbed ALL the featurettes on this set, seek out the new documentary, \\"Hey Boo, Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird\\" which I reviewed last year. Both of these DVDs belong in every home.<br /><br />For all the material on this marvelous set from Universal, a copy belongs in every home - especially one with pre-teen and teenage children. And with a selling price on Amazon as low as it is, there is no reason not to buy a copy now! Thank you Universal for going the extra mile.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

B005M5NFKU|5.0|I am a late convert to the brilliance of Ryan Adams.  I know there are differences to his solo work vs that with the Cardinals, but nevertheless this is an outstanding consistent body of work that never gets old.  Ranges from poetic to haunting to downright beautiful.  Listen to \\"How do you keep love alive\\" and try not to be moved.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|I recently watched this film and found the title misleading.  Although the name of the movie is \\"Immortals\\", it is mostly about mortals.  There is only about 3 minutes worth of immortal content in this film.  The rest of the movie deals with the shame of being born a bastard.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've only played the quest so far but it is lots of fun. hopefully the classic mode will be just as fun.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!  This  is by far the worst in the series! It was good in the beginning, then she started killing peple off!!! then by far the most upsetting kills were prim and finnick!!!!!! then she killed the leader of distric 13 and president snow. then katniss ends up with peeta and gale goes off to someother district...... btw if u havnt figured it out, im team gale.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Received this CD last week and absolutely love it!  All of the songs are great!  I would recommend this CD to anyone that also enjoys Frank Sinatra.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love this game, so cute, no issues on Kindle Fire. Fight over who gets to play. Only wish would be to seg up different players.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This cd really is GREAT. Even though her voice is obviously not the same as is was at one time, this cd brought Whitney back. It's every bit as good as many of her earlier cd's. It's just a shame that this cd and Whitney did not get the attention they deserved. We love you, Whitney.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I had downloaded the free trial version, I really loved the game but did not want to download it for $4.99, so when it came up this morning about it being the free app of the day I was so excited! I think if you love mahjong and you love a challenge you will love this game!
B002BU0DPE|2.0|DURABILITY  I've owned two pairs of these.  In both, the left ear cup has gone out. I purchased the extended protection plan on them at Best Buy, but after my second pair went down the same road as the 1st, i'm not even going to bother returning and exchanging these again.  BUILD:  The build is sort of flimsy. Mine have never physically broken, but it feels as if they easily could. They just don't feel SOLID. They feel very fragile.  COMFORT:  As for comfort, the ear pads are actually very comfortable and completely enclosed my ears. They made for hours of comfortable gameplay, video watching, and music listening.  SOUND QUALITY:  Awful, annoying hissing and crackling noises CONSTANTLY. While you're listing, playing, or watching something you can barely hear it. But when you aren't, it's a constant hissing and crackling noise. Also, there's this highpitched feedback as well that will persist unless you unplug them from your laptop. if you don't, you won't be able to sleep because you'll hear a constant high pitched ringing.  Even with the bass boost all the way up, it's lacking and definitely not as bassful as they could or should be.  They also leak very badly. very badly. Your COD explosions and music can be head EXTREMELY well by others even in another room. And this is without even being on max volume.  MIC: Works just fine. Actually, it works too well. It picks up every single sound present, even when you aren't even using it.  OVERALL:  Comfort: 5/5  Sound: 1/5  Mic: 3/5  Durability: 1/5  Build: 2/5  Would I buy from Turtle Beach again? hell no.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I would suggest for anyone who loves to play mahjong. I love the fact that you can use the auto-zoom instead of pinching all the time.
B0061S073A|5.0|I got this so my daughter (3 yrs) could play her games and do something semi-educational while I work on my homework and not have to worry about her either getting into something inappropriate or changing settings. This app delivers everything it promises! It was one of the first apps I got on my kindle fire and I'm grateful for it every time my daughter uses the device! Plus you cant beat the price!! Child lock is a MUST HAVE if you have little ones using your device!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game (Going Nuts) is a very amazing game! I love the never ending flight of the flying squirrel! idol how many ranks there are but that builds the suspense
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game.  But I play a lot of mahjong games. Thank you for the game on the kendle fire
B0063IH60K|3.0|I really like this app but I'm getting tired of winning every single game. Some people might like it but I would prefer a better challenge.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Not much can be said. I grew up with Toy Story. The 3rd movie blew me away. Amazing and perfect. I was lucky enough to get the Blu Ray trilogy brand new at a pawn shop for $24. Let's just say it was the best deal of all time. I love these movies. They define my childhood. Classics for all time.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Ads are very minimal and take a second to get by. No big deal. Tutorial is a great example of good computer based training. Teaches how to play very quickly and ensures a greater game play experience for ADD types. 5 stars!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I received the movie. very quickly.  I was very please with the fast and curtious service.  Thanks Mr Gerald Lang
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Awesome run great looks awesome no crashing..galaxy s2 tragics are Pretty slick not drab and boring like most of this type.

B0063IH60K|5.0|can't really screw up solitaire. it does what it's supposed to. drains my battery, but i think all games do
B006ON41FC|5.0|awesome u have to dodge trees, rotten acorns, and the worst of all the mean owls so ya this game is fun. :)
B006ON41FC|5.0|Better than I thought it would be, simple yet lots of things to play with. Hope more things get added!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it never gets old and always gives you new games that are challenging but fun! install as soon as possible!
055380684X|4.0|I had previously read \\"Talent is Overrated\\" and wanted to read someone else's interpretation of how talent is cultivated. Goes about the same topic in a different way, with the focus in this book being on \\"Myelin,\\" which are parts of your nervous system that develop skill. It was similar to deliberate practice from \\"Talent is Overrated,\\" and in the end they all mean the same thing. Great to read to have a complementary understanding of how to become talented, I would recommend this book, it's a short and easy read.
0385535139|5.0|John Grisham has written many good books, a couple of terrible clunkers, and a few superb ones.  \\"THE LITIGATORS\\", his latest, is the best of them all.  It's about a young lawyer's escape from his soul-destroying job at a white-shoe law firm, and how he ends up working with a couple of ambulance-chasers called Finney & Figg.  Grisham's ironic wit and unerring sense of the ridiculous guides the reader through some hilarious adventures, as the unlikely trio take on a hopeless product liability lawsuit and get themselves in more trouble than can be imagined.  So skillfully are the characters portrayed, that they soon step out of the book and into our lives as real people whose troubles and triumphs become our own. Even as we smile at their foibles, we become genuinely concerned about them, and wonder how they're doing long after we turn the last page.  Borrow it if you can, but I suggest you run right out and buy it, so you can re-read some of its memorable passages whenever you need a chuckle.
B000083C49|5.0|Received program on time and in exc condition. This is as expected and the Movie was a replacement for the original which I had dropped the disk and broke it. Thank you very much.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|Dawkins is one of my favorite authors.  In \\"The Greatest Show On Earth\\", he clearly lays out all the scientific proof mankind has for evolution.  This includes genetic comparisons, anatomical observations, the fossil record, and clear occurrences of evolution happening before our eyes.  In the end, this is perhaps the best book on evolution I've read.  Dawkins manages to be instructive without the hostility towards religion he has exhibited in some of his other books.  Further, the proof is well-explained for the non-scientists without being \\"dumbed down\\".  Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the origins of modern species and biology in general.
0545425115|5.0|This series is fascinating and brutal. It's addictive and you keep thinking about it long beyond finishing the books. I hesitated for a while to read them because of the many negative reviews, the comparison to Twilight (yawn) and supposedly bad ending but none of it is true. This is a great Trilogy and I wish there were more books. The target age group might be teenagers but I'm 46 and couldn't put them down. I'm glad I read them and can't wait for the movie.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John Scalzi tells a compelling, interesting story.  All the books in this series are excellent, but in my opinion the first is the best of the series.  Old Man's War shows how technology can't make up for experience, and it highlights a growing problem in America: the disconnect between the military and the average citizen.  Once people enlist for space travel, they are unable to return to Earth.  Overall, the characters are well-developed, especially the main character.  The story is alternately thoughtful and action-packed (and sometimes, both simultaneously).  I highly recommend this book if you are a fan of the \\"space combat\\" genre, such as David Weber or John Ringo.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|imaginative twist on an old favorite. story line is fun and keeps your interest and wanting to play and play
B0043UGLBA|3.0|It is fairly good, thus I gave it 3 stars. the graphics are excellent and the actors keep you on edge.  The story line wasn't the best to me. The plot needs more development.  There is a lot of female nudity--especially full frontal nudity. But if you are at all interested in male frontal nudity, it will be shot from afar on rare occasions, if at all. You will barely see it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A really great book that I will recommend to anyone that is a fan of science fiction and especially those who are children of the 80s.  Cline uses all of the pop culture references that I can remember and some that I didn't know of until I looked them up.  Really excellent pacing and character development.  Will definitely re-read at some point.
B004I744AS|5.0|Easy to use, and gave much more information than I expected. I look forward to sharing this application with my smart friends.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|beautiful graphics. if you are new to this game it teaches you in the beginning what the tiles are and how to match them.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Droid 3 installation. - I seldom write a review but am really disappointed with this app. Graphics are gorgeous but after 30 minutes of trying everything feasible to play an actual game, I still could not get beyond the tutorial. Tried the free version a few months ago and it kept freezing my Droid. Hoped the full version would be an improvement. It was...my Droid didn't freeze! Really was looking forward to having a quality Mahjong game at my fingertips.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this app! I have several apps that are the same type of game. Tho this app is the best by far .. no comparison!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|just downloaded and good gameplay on kindle fire.  has both a standard and storyline mode.  forces storyline tutorial but that part is short.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase.  I was looking for a nice non-leather cover for my Kindle Fire and decided to try this one.  I like it a lot.  I bought it in pink and black.  It protects the Kindle and is not bulky.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is awesome totally addicting so try not to spend all of your free time playing it because that's what ive done because I'm so darn addicted to it so much fun I have
B00005RDRO|4.0|First off, Peter Falk is not the main character in the movie, nor is he the primary detective. Why the hell is the DVD cover designed like this? The legendary Charles Addams created the marvelous movie poster (also used in the opening sequence as a popup book in an iron box) - why wasn't this wonderful artwork used? I will never understand the irrational mind of Hollywood marketing . . .
B0067Q42BY|4.0|free app of the day. does not work on the fire. tiles are not clickable. don't know why amazon didn't check this first. good thing I didn't pay for it. wasted my time though.  Update: uninstalled it. Reinstalled it. Now it works. Don't know what happened the first time. Pretty good game.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Good game, interesting and great graphics!  Would like the option to bypass the dev's store upon open, but it's not greatly irritating.  I didn't realize this dev created more than a few of the games I enjoy
B0067Q42BY|5.0|works great on Samsung infuse.  Controls are easy to understand and actually make sense.  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a Mahjong game.
B004SDEP38|1.0|You basically can't do anything unless you have the paid for version! You cant even create documents!!! No wonder its free!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|CAUTION: EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE!  OMG!  I JUST HOPE THIS DOESN'T FURTHER CAUSE DIVORCE, LOSS OF JOB & EXCOMUNICATION FROM ALL OF MY NON-VIRTUAL FRIENDS!  OMG!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really liked this game on my kindle.I never played this game before downloading but I really like it.  good for all ages!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Really fun puzzle game, it has a story that's like a comic book and as you beat levels you get artifacts, overall good game, people were saying ads were on it, I didn't even notice them, so I'm not sure. Another Great app of the day!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is a very great game and I love it, every one should get it,, and it is a very fun game.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I was tempered and broke my last controller and will never make that mistake again, this controller came quickly and once tested it charges fast and holds charge for days, upon inspection everything is legit compared to my last sony controller, however i did notice this controllers feels lighter then the older one i own.  Anyways, great controller, best color and feels right.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is awesome...those people that say stuff about feint are wrong....I haven't had a complaint about feint on my kindle fire.the only thing is I got it on sale for free....and it should be a free app...it might not be worth $0.99
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I liked this book for it's look into Stalinist Russia and the effect of a repressive regime on its people. The plot was engaging, but the characters were very well developed. By the end of the book I'd come to really like and admire Leo and Raisa.  If it weren't for the price, I would have immediately purchased Agent 6 just to continue the friendship. But since I already have a backlog of books to read, I just put it on readeriq.com so I know when the price comes down.
B006ON41FC|1.0|if your looking for one those games that gets better the longer you play, this is for you. but... no buts. great game. enjoy.
B004C6QCUA|5.0|You just can't beat the sound -- how it comes alive right before your eyes in the SACD high resolution format.  I have several vinyl and CD versions of this title.  Yes, some vinyl versions are very warm.  However, the dynamics of this title on SACD is unsurpassed.  I'm glad I bought my copy while it was still in print a few years ago.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|my grandmother told me to download this and i said, so she still did it and know in glad she didd
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun, good graphics, just hard enough not to be overwhelming. Now if I could just get back the time I've spent playing this today!
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is fun but stupid at the time bigot this for free and now this dam thing is saying I don't own it
B006ON41FC|5.0|its pretty addicting but it gets a little repetitive. still a great game just needs more to do after a while
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app requires access to my private phone logs, phone call history and status.<br />Is it really necessary for a mp3 store interface ?<br />I chose not to install this app because of this.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love it so much the best ever i hope u play it if u do plz pay it is 10 times better he so plz bye it oh Ps i review almost everything so look for me k
B0063IH60K|5.0|Do it to relax, to get to sleep. It is easy &amp; the graphics pleasing to the eye. Wish there were more games like this
0545123291|4.0|I read this book every free chance I had and I couldn't wait to finish it and see what happened.<br /><br />I was a bit uneasy when the author introduced two new perspectives to those of Sam and Grace. But the voices of Cole and Isabel were great additions to this story. Their interaction with each other was great to read.<br /><br />This is a good second book in a trilogy. That doesn't always happen - a second book in a trilogy being good. This was pretty good. It definitely serves as an arc - a necessary, exciting, read it whenever you possibly can arc - between Shiver and Forever.<br /><br />Cole becomes an unlikely hero. Isabel actual cares about something. Sam is &#34;cured&#34;. Grace gets really sick. All of the characters are trying to find out who they are and where they are meant to be. It is interesting to watch them try to put the puzzle pieces of their lives together. Where do each of them fit in this world of Mercy Falls?
B000P6YNSE|3.0|The season in its entirety was a solid 3-stars in my book, but the season finale was a real disappointment.  *Spoiler Alert*  I really disliked the \\"flash forwards\\" of Jack's life falling apart and feel that it's a terrible ending to anticipate for the entire remainder of the series.  Why would they do that in season 3 and not way later in the series?  Hopefully, in season 4, we discover that it was just a nightmare he was having, or there will be some other \\"out\\" that results in a better life for Jack after all he's done for his fellow castaways.  Knowing this early that he'll return home to a terrible life (presumably extreme symptoms of PTSD) is really disheartening.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice game. good variety of activities to play. some are too easy though. I'm rating this just to get the points.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is much like the award winning game for the apple ipod. Jetpack Joyride and this game contains similar challenges, shop, and similar point to the game. For a dollar this is definetely one everyone will enjoy.
B003YUS64A|5.0|I Bought these as a present for my boyfriend. He hasnt stoped wearing them since. He says they feel like if you're barefoot. They're super light weght and also look great. I recommend these 100% :)
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Plays REALLY well on the kindle fire (for me anyway). Zoom feature is nice for smaller screens too.  I'm not the type to be interested in a story for this type of game, but there IS a story if that matters to you in a Mahjong game. Some people are reporting freezing on the kindle fire, but I haven't had any issues.  There ARE forced \\"check out our other game\\" type ads before you can even start playing in this ad-free game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun to play easy to learn great that it was free get it love it when it comes out with new ones to conquer
0316776963|4.0|This collection of anecdotes left me feeling slightly empty. I didn't know if I should feel good about what author David Sedaris has accomplished or feel bad for what appears to be a slightly unfortunate life. Although the stories didn't contain tragedy they also weren't uplifting. I certainly didn't laugh out loud at any of them but I did smile at a couple. Sedaris is an excellent writer in terms of style and clarity and his pacing was perfect. My time reading this book just flew by. This is the first book by Sedaris that I have read but I am not sure that I would read another. I have read some books by Bill Bryson and have preferred those.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy this game.  It is compelling in the quest mode.  I've not played the other modes yet, but have a feeling that they will be the same.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I was weary at first to purchase this particular one, as it was half the price of others and was afraid it would be cheaply made. I was very pleased to find that my water bottle (20oz) fits great and the caddy doesn't become lopsided with only that in it. Exactly what I needed to make my stroller a perfect 5 stars (Britax B-Agile)
B004V2AWKG|3.0|This book is a good, easy read, probably able to be read in one sitting if there is sufficient time and determination. The plot is interesting and mysterious and draws the reader in quite quickly. If you're into these kind of books, this is the one I would recommend reading first, since it is the simplest. The book has a solid main character who is relate-able to young readers, so I would say this would be a better book for middle school age rather than high school and beyond it.
B000OVLBF8|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this movie. It's got so much going for it. Awesome concept, awesome source material, high-budget, experienced director/writer, and a stellar supporting cast. But it all gets derailed when it betrays its core foundations.  The acting is below average. The villain sucks (Wes Bentley, that means you). The villain's lackeys suck. The fights have their punches pulled. There's no edge. There's too many jokes that don't work. Sam Elliot's role couldn't be more cliche if it tried. It's predictable, and worse: it's derivative. The final sequence is a complete rip-off of the original Blade film, complete with spirits ramming themselves into the main villain's body so that they will grant him more power. It literally plays out almost the same way - but it's far from the previous standard thanks to Wes Bentley's cardboard acting.  Two stars for Nicolas Cage and the great effects (seeing the Ghost Rider ride down the side of a building is spectacular). Could've been great cult-classic material. Instead, it comes across as a mainstream sellout that falls on its face.
0316056863|3.0|Tina Fey and her journey to success is hilarious and down to earth. I identified with her a lot. I spent my 20's in Chicago. I too couldn't find my son's birthday party cups/plates (Chuggington only sells in UK).  I am a working mom and I quit breast feeding at 7-8 weeks for the same exact reasons and ran into the same \\"Teat Nazis\\" here in Chicago. I am suggesting for my book club, but everyone has likely picked it up by now.  I was taken aback by the Autism comment on page 246. She obviously does not have any perspective on people with autism to understand how difficult and how heartbreaking it is for the people themselves and their families. If she had an autistic child, she would then realize that she would have had to quit her dream job for her daughter in order to take her to all the countless evaluations and therapies. That joke was reaching and minor anyway, why not edit it out? I'm surprised there wasn't a \\"short bus\\" mention in there.  That one is a winner too... Women like Tina Fey should know better about certain issues.  Other than that and the fact that the storyline jumped around, it was a good read.
0062082353|5.0|A true insight on the front line fighting. I was thoroughly impressed with Chris Kyle's honesty about the Armed Forces and our SEALS in particular. He shows what it is like to have the heart of a lion and the soul of a warrior. I'm grateful that we have men like this. Ignore the haters and get this book!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|be blessed by this app.  i would like the notes to be available offline though.<br />is there a tutorial for using the app somewhere?
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The story is quite good, and the twists' make it addicting!  I am having a hard time stopping just to write this review.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition) is the 2003 sequel to Matrix and is just as good. The storyline is very intelligently written and raises many ethical and philosophical questions. Science fiction films that it can be compared with are Brazil and Blade Runner. The special effects are tremendous and Kenau Reeves is great in the role as Neo. The soundtrack is uneven with some tracks being great and some so so. I can not wait to see the final and concluding part of the amazing Matrix series. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|The movie is the same as the first one, someone from the crew ends up getting lost just when the wedding day is a few days apart.<br />Pros:<br />Good laugh scenes<br />Funny but gross scenes<br />Cons:<br />Ultra violet copy wont transfer ipod (useless)
B000BKVQTS|3.0|The Brothers Grimm is a 2005 Adventure film directed by Terry Gilliam (whom has also written the script). Being that Gilliam was with the Monty Python gang the expectations are high. Unfortunately whilst the idea is a brilliant one, i.e., taking the world of the Grimm tales and turning them into a film; the end result is far from astounding and more of mediocre. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger both do what they can to create great characters but the problem is the less then great dialogue. Overall a film that is worthy of a 3 out of 5.
B0036T32LQ|5.0|From beginning to end, this film keeps you on the edge of your seat. As the plot unfolds, you are led deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. You won't want to stop watching this movie once you start it.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single-Disc Edition) is the fourth film in the Indiana Jones franchise and unfortunately it is not nearly as good as the other three previous ones. Try as he might, the magic of Indy is just not there. The storyline is just all-right and the the dialogue so so. The special effects are good but nothing that I have not seen before. Overall an film that is just descent. However, this is just the problem. An Indiana Jones film should be awesome. Still I give it a 3 out of 5.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Very addicting, but almost never starts.  Usually hangs with black screen at startup, sometimes gets to studio logo, then hangs. Almost never actually starts.  5 stars for addictive, fun gameplay. 1 star for almost never working.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really love this game. 1. its to fun. 2. it makes time go by a lot faster! but I'm really surprised by there being that many one ratings
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Never really played mahjong but it's pretty fun, and it shows you how to play it so you don't jump in blind. I found this game very enjoyable.
B000005KQT|5.0|I gave this a gist to a friend who loves harmonica music. I did a lot of research on line about various musicians, not having been familiar with this type of music. My friend listens to it almost every day, and was thrilled with the gift.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|if you like mahjong. you're going to love this game. story mode is pretty good. zooming is actually pretty neat.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I think this is a fun game for any ages. my mom says its entertaining and I personally love it and I hope you love it too.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I love this game. It's a fun twist on a classic game. I love thegraphics, but I don't like the ads for other games.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is adtictive and fun and great time waster get this game it is awesome please get it while it free
B006ON41FC|3.0|similar premise to many games. enough original goals to keep you interested. great for the 10 and under set but everyone seems to love it.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Product works great! Does just what it says. Converts Digital Optics Audio into Analog Audio.<br />Arrived Prompt and worked like a charm. Enables me to use a outside audio link for surround sound.
0307956350|4.0|This is a traditional spy thriller with a twist (which is, I'm sure, how it was sold to the publisher). The protagonist is female and her \\"cover\\" is that she's a suburban mother and housewife. Or is she a suburban stay-at-home mom that also happens to be a spy? (You can also throw in the tired trope of \\"getting out of the game,\\" only to be \\"pulled back in.\\")<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, basically well-written tale that moves at breakneck speed. I think the ideas--an overlay of the marriage dynamic on a traditional spy tale, with the added intrigue of a James Bond gender flip-flop--are better than the execution. Like many books of this genre, not all of the twists, red herrings and double and triple agent reveals make total sense when taken whole, and the spy cliches comes at you fast and furious, but it's a still a rollicking ride that will keep you guessing until the end.<br /><br />The first half, which deals with more domestic drama than international intrigue, is better-written than the second, which gets more and more far-fetched as the plot twists ratchet their way up to utterly unbelievable.<br /><br />My biggest turn off was the stiff dialogue and a few too many woman-in-peril \\"jokes\\" where Kate, the supposed super-agent, is shown to be, \\"just a dumb girl,\\" something the author apparently find hilarious, since he uses the ploy again and again. For that sin, I almost gave this one a mere three stars, but, in the end, despite the weaknesses I found myself entertained. (I so frequently wish Amazon had a 1/2-star rating option, but I digress ...)<br /><br />Certainly not a genre classic, this one clearly cribs elements from a LOT of better spy stories, but it's still pretty fun. A good one when you're in the mood for some mindless fluff.
B005I6EU48|4.0|The product arrived timely and in excellent condition. I was a little put off that the whole thing was not red, but the product itself is excellent. I have no problems with it and it works just fine. I am very happy with this purchase.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am really enjoying this game, especially the power/trick tiles. The only thing that could improve is some of the layouts are hard to visualize from a fixed point of view.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Why does the paid version of the application have ads in it? It doesn't matter that they are ads for your other games, they are still ads. Also it does not work on Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.0
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is really awesome. most people got it for free so not one person should conplain about the ads.
B0053O89WY|5.0|One of my favorite shows and if not the best show out there at this point. It has everything and it'll have you laughing off your chair. Plus you can learn a thing or two.<br />Have been watching the show since season three and I'm loving it. I'd recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a comedy.<br /><br />Can't wait till season 5 is available. :)
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and I highly recommend it to any anime fan. If you're looking for an action film, this may not be the most action-y film but I can guarantee you'll still enjoy it for what it has.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finished this book in a single day, could not put it down. Loved it! Read the second one immediately and working to finish the series. Anxiously awaiting the movies to bring these magical pages to life =) MuST READ
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Really enjoy this. Thought maybe it might not be for me but once I started, I didn't want to quit.  Works great on kindle fire. Directions seem to go fast, but it also helps along the way.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'd like to point out that the ads aren't bad at all. Even if I had paid full price for this app, I don't think I'd mind them. Really the only time they show for me so far is right when I open the game. No pop ups in the middle of play. As for the game itself, it has a lot more options than standard mahjong games. This does seem to make winning a lot easier. I'm not going to dock any stars for that because I'm still enjoying the game quite a lot. Also, I'm sure the difficulty will go up as I play through the story.
B004I744AS|5.0|A great experience. It is so much more then a dictionary! it makes learning fun!  It even helps in pronouncing the word/s for you.  They even implemented games we all learned as a child to help you learn new words as well as definitions....Great job!
B00650SSWG|4.0|LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT. THOUGHT IT WAS A CHICK FLICK BUT GUYS CAN LAUGH AND ENJOY IT TOO. WATCH IT.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I've been using this application for quite a while now. Easy to use, lots of features like audio support, devotions, etc. It also supports many translations, bookmarks and is simply a joy to use. I have this on my smart phone and on my Kindle Fire.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I'm only doing this in the hopes that I will no longer be asked to rate the game. Obviously I enjoy the game to an extent if I'm taking measures to bypass something that makes it take longer to play the game, so take from that what you will...
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is simply amazing.  I purchased this book for myself as a Christmas gift and i thoroughly enjoyed it from cover to cover. She made me laugh out loud right through. I really recommend this book to all who want a good Make you laugh out loud daily dose of happiness with Ellen :-). A perfect escape of our every day life/stresses....made me wish there really would be a Nemo 2 one day lol....we need more Ellen/Dory in all our lives
B0067Q42BY|1.0|This has got to be the worst mahjong app out there. You can't play the game until you complete some annoying tutorial
0553386794|5.0|I watched the HBO series first, then got the book. To be honest I like the HBO series better, perhaps because I saw it first? But nonetheless good storyline, I prefer other authors writing style though. This has some elements of multiple series in it, can you spot the Dragon Age contribution?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I Just started playing this game but so far I am really enjoying it.  I will definetly try more games from this company!
B0068TL23G|4.0|This is a great game... but I am stuck on Chapter 7 ... Stage 12 ... have been for over 2 weeks... any clues anyone???
B0067Q42BY|5.0|works great. love it on my kindle fire. would recommend this to everyone. love me some mahjong. even better when it's the free app of the day.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|Seriously, 2 bucks for an &quot;app&quot; a ten year old could create. Fun for about 15 minutes, which is about the same amount of time you have to ask for a refund. Then you cry.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|It is a good time killer of a game, but it does get a little bong after a while, over all its a good game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is a blast! I can't stop playing this game! Hard to get the hang of at first, but once you get used to it, its a lot of fun.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|how do you play this and where am i I hate pie but love pocoyo la la la la cow!!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Such a fun time waster can be a little tedious saving up for the permanent upgrades but still a ton of fun for me and my six year old
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome. I love how you have to work your way up to new games. I love the parachute game.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|So far, I really enjoy it. The music gets a little old but the graphics are wonderful, the play is smooth and the story version is fun! Got this when it was free but would have been worth the $5 it normally is.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is an addicting game and I highly recommend you play it and at least try , it is definity worth buying
B004XQO90E|5.0|I must live under a rock. How had this movie escaped my attention? Waaaaay better than Avatar. Probably the best sci-fi movie since Aliens. Has this movie escaped your attention too? Well, come out from under that rock and buy this movie. Seriously, do it. Now.
0545259088|5.0|That is all I have to say. Cole St. Clair, mmmwah! Thank you, Maggie, for what you did with Cole in this book. I would have been so sad...
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I got this game as a free app from Amazon for my Kindle Fire.  I love it.  I find Mahjong to by fun but slightly boring at times.  This game combines the fun of Mahjong with an ongoing challenge game -Thank you for developing
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is fun. I play it all the time. it is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very awesome.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love Going Nuts, in fact so much that I, (code name)  Bubbly will get (code name)  Doodzy will share. her opinion, go ahead Doodzy,! hi Doodzy here i LOVE Going Nuts it is my favorote game EVER.Here is Bubbly,!hi Bubly here again,  Oh actually i was just gonna say we are really 2 different people, no jokes!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It shows you everything  else, but what your looking for! Complete waste of time and space! don't be a fool skip this app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a very enjoyable app. Some of the games are very clever, new ideas while others are reworkings of old classics. So far my favorite has been the sushi skewer. Anyway, you start with 12games and must earn points to unlock others. The only reason I am typing this and not playing is because I was promised points to unlock another game!
B0073O0AME|1.0|This guy has lost it  Who wants to listen to an 85 year old sing.  What's worse is that he's become an embarresment.  He seems to come out weekly with a goofy left leaning comment.  If you can't score with the music give it up.  There are too many washed up people out there who turn to left wing comments to score points with the masses to survive.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Interest in game with a storyline.  The game has a lot of replay value.  Looking forward to continue playing the game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great graphics and challenging. keeps interest past 5 minutes. will purchase more apps from this developer.  will pass on to friends.
1451648537|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but found it lacking in any new insight into the mind of one of the 20th/21st centuries' most interesting tech-entrepreneurs. This man, along with a handful of other inspired thinkers, helped to usher in the age of information. He individually, through the sheer power of his imaginative foresight, helped to define today's modern technological landscape, and effectively reshaped the industrial design process from inception to execution; he deserved something better this. I feel like Walter Isaacson's readers deserved something better as well.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Completely enjoyable.  Liked it as much as the first one.  I hope the developer keeps making more games under the Quell umbrella.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love this game! Really like the single tap to play, and the multiple hints. Not much sound or fireworks upon winning.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Quick to start and easy to get addicted, make split decisions and go nuts! Little achievements make it go by very quickly and allow you to focus on one thing
B006ON41FC|4.0|the graphics are good and its a kinda addictive game for so cheep. I love the little outfits, and other options the game offers
B0067Q42BY|2.0|I'm starting to really hate G5... they are overly aggressive with their ads and their apps are outrageously high-priced and not that great. All of them, including Mahjong Artifacts, are worth no more than $1-2.

B0058VW36U|1.0|frozen on kindle fire after passing a few levels disappointed! only played for a short time. wish I knew what is up!! only 1 star because I had too don't waste money!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love the fact that there is a game that is simple enough that most all ages can enjoy, that you may stop at a moments notice, and yet it doesn't get boring due to the constant goals. The only con is that it is resource intensive. It is rather Kathy on my wife's galaxy s 4g but does well on my g2x.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this game has been fun. can be addictive. love that there is a bit of a story that goes with it and that you're earning a piece of something as you complete each puzzle. recommend this game for people that enjoy puzzles and the like.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|angry birds is awsome to play when bored or on long car rides that is why I gave it five stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I luv this game. the squirrel is so cute except it asks you to rate it too often . u can buy outfits and costumes with acorns for your squirrel
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Omg love this game if u like to play it on the kindle... then get a ps3 and GET THE GAME I mean it get it get it now did u get it yet
0811875040|2.0|I had great expectations for this book: the pictures are lovely, and the scalloped pages are a nice touch. The basic recipe for most of the cakes is both complicated - and a dud. It's a \\"Hot Milk Cake\\" with complicated steps and a nerve-wracking attention to temperatures, and I thought all this work would result in something spectacular. Not so! For a better bake on cake and technique, get \\"A Piece of Cake\\" by Susan Purdy.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|this game sucks you just match tiles its crappy in order for you to get people to buy your games u need to make games worth their crewmen times you bunch of idiots
B002ZG980U|1.0|DVD contains about 10 minutes of ads that you cannot skip via any means. Get the movie via any other means than this DVD or you are supporting this type of disreputable and disrespectful marketing
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is pretty cool in my opinion!  Althought ut can some times glitches out on me when I first start,  other then that I love this game!
0439023491|5.0|My daughter bought me the first book for Christmas knowing I am a kind of Science Fiction nut and I loved it. I was soon looking for the second book, after looking into several local book stores I settled on Amazon and bought books 2 & 3. Great story although it ended rather abruptly, can't wait for the movie.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|What a gorgeous mahjong games. So many differentt ways to play. The graphicso are smooth and easy. I could do without the story, but I still enjoy playing.
0439023513|5.0|My daughter bought me the first book for Christmas knowing I am a kind of Science Fiction nut and I loved it. I was soon looking for the second book, after looking into several local book stores I settled on Amazon and bought books 2 & 3. Book three continued the story to an awsome conclusion and great story although it ended rather abruptly,I would like to see a forth book rebuilding. I can't wait for the movie.
0525478817|5.0|Yes, this book is good. Yes, this book is also sad. Yes, John green is amazing and everything he writes is also.<br />But its not a suffocating sadness like other books that leave you with one final biting sentence at the end of the book to exemplify how life isn't fair, boo hoo.<br />This book is about two people who live, even though they are dying.<br />Honestly it made me ashamed I, a perfectly healthy human being, am not living as much as the cancer patients in this book.<br />I just finished this book about 20 minutes ago and feel like I'm having a mid-life (hm well maybe 1/4 life ) crisis.<br />WARNING: THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|The value of this backpack is huge.  The construction and the detailing are very nice.  I easily fit my Nikon D700, 4 other lenses, flash, IPad and a ton of small items in the pack.  Regrettably the hauling loop handle on the top of the pack separated from the pack after its first real use.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|That was my first impression when I listened to this album. But so what, this album is solid with its heavy-folk influenced instrumentation. A great listening experience.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is very good love all the plans and easy to follow.  It's easy to listen to and helps me to learn the proper saying of the words.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Love how there are new goals to beat. Can sometimes lag a bit. But overall fun game!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It wasn't even bad. The sound was decent and all the changes were minor. If you dont like this blu ray version, buy the VHS version. GL is an artist, let him have his creativity.
0553103547|5.0|Had taken some time off from fiction recently to focus more on non-fiction (yuck) and came back when my brother told me how much he was enjoying the TV series of this title. Since I've always found books to be far superior to even the best video translation, I bought the first book in the series.<br /><br />I am so impressed with the intricacies of the culture, the characters, and the storyline. He doesn't shy away from anything he needs to do to make the plot interesting and realistic including killing off key characters when he feels it will add to the story. Well developed characters with deeply differing viewpoints on their situations makes the reading even more intriguing. Finishing one chapter simply makes you anxious to read the next. I'll be buying Book 2 in the series immediately.
B005HSL626|2.0|It is an ok game but the ads are just terrible and hard to click away from. I personally don't even like clicking on skip. Without the ads I would giveit a 4star rating. I'm very disapionted
B006ON41FC|5.0|Pretty entertaining app. Nice and simple. Good graphics. You can remove the Open Feint thing by going into the Open feint settings.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|took me a few minutes to learn the controls but once i got it it is an easy fun app.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a very addicting game. good for someone who is competitive however getting the points to open up other games is a bit annoying
B004LUS390|5.0|Terrific app for artists. Best you can get for an android device. I was a little concerned after reading all the reviews about it being broken on the fire, but I've had no issues so far. Maybe they fixed it, or maybe people are doing something wrong (maybe it breaks on a rooted device?). Anyway, if you're an artist I think you owe it to yourself to pick this up. Side note: using your finger seems okay, but I recommend using a stylus, just make sure your screen is clean.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I had my doubts when I read some of the reviews and listened to audio from it on youtube. Could this little plastic box that costs $40 really produce sounds that remind the player of $1000+ guitar rigs? I can now say without a doubt that it does!  I plugged in and slowly rolled up the gain and volume and couldn't believe what I was hearing. This thing sounds better than the amps I use. Utterly amazed.  Runs on two AAA with an auxiliary jack for hooking up an mp3 player or as a line out to a small speaker.  I recommend getting a decent set of ear buds or earphones that have a good bass response. There is a lot of good tone coming from this VOX amPlug so take advantage of it. Don't use junk headphones. You'll thank me later!  The tone is a very high gain distortion, ideal for metal riffage. But, in my opinion, you can get some decent rock/blues tones when rolling the tone back. No BB King or anything, just a nice crunchy overdriven blues. If its solely a blues tone your after, you'd be better off buying the Classic Rock or AC30 version.  With this VOX Metal amPlug you will find yourself practicing more because its just so easy to plug in. Totally worth $40.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is incredibly accurate! I love it.  it is a lot of help!  very useful.  I love how it shows me the weather from my notification bar !
B004EJUMT2|4.0|I started hearing about this band back in 2010 right after this album came out in Decibel. The cover art looked interesting and oddly familiar, and it seemed to be getting good reviews so I decided to check it out. I loved it! I went to find it but it was only available as an import at the time. When I heard that Metal Blade Records would be issuing the album in the US, in January of 2011, I was very excited. I have since been looking for this CD but could not seem to find it anywhere so I finally just purchased it here on Amazon. I was pleased to finally be able to hold this fantastic album in my hands (I previously purchased it on iTunes). Everything about this band and album is great! The songs are catchy and fairly simple but they really pack a punch. You will be singing along within the first listen or two. If you want something catchy and evil to listen to then Ghost is most certainly your band. Every song on this album is fantastic. Highly recommended if you are a fan of Mercyful Fate and 70s pop rock music.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|its a better game than the seasons verson of angry birds. it acually made sence to me because i watched the movie and their was a reason to harm the monkeys and free the birds. the only prolbem i have with it is thatthe last 15 levels say comming soon but the dont tell you when if ever!!!
0439023513|5.0|I don't write reviews ever, but when I saw that there were so many negative reviews I just had to get my thoughts out.  This series, all three books, and how it ends, was amazing.  First off if you are looking for a \\"love fantasy\\" where everything you want to happen for the characters eventually does, then this is not the book for you......read twilight or something.  This series will rip your heart out of your chest, and then make you beg to have it back.  Everything that happens to the characters, the feelings they go through, the suffering and pain, how war changes them, is real and you feel it....you almost change with them.  I  I am so glad I didn't by into the negative hype of the other reviews; there have not been many books that made me feel so much emotion. When I finished the third book, I felt ran through, ringed out, and then hung up to try and put myself back together.  Read these books, draw your own conclusions, you wont have any regrets.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|not my thing. lonching little birds at pigs. i never got the firdt one so i dont know why the birds attach the pigs. could you explain the reasoning for the seasons to. the seasons arnt named winter sprimg summer and fall its stupid things like hoggies and kisses and halloween.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|I finally got around to reading the John W. Campbell (Don A. Stuart) novella, Who Goes There?  I can safely say that none of the movie adaptations does it justice, including the simplistic title of all three: The Thing.<br />That said, all three movies are in my DVD collection, I like them all.  They all have good points and bad points.  All three are highly entertaining.<br />Is this third version as good as the other two, no.  Did I see it as a prequel, no.  To me it just seemed like another botched attempt at a very good story.  All three left out the best part of the novella, the human angle, and a really terrific ending.  But, you have to take things as they are, not as you'd wish them to be.  In this case, I wish this movie had taken more time developing characters and not just a high body count that was impossible to count.  I wish they had introduced the discovery of the space ship in a better light; no wow moment there because you can't see what it is.  I wish they hadn't included two endings; one that made no sense and one that served as the only proof they were making a prequel.  I also wish they had hired stronger actors capable of making an impression in the short time they were given.<br />Wishing obviously doesn't make it so.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i love the book so much. i also lve the hunger game very much too. it has drama, action, adventure, romance, tradgity, and ironey all in one mid length book. its sad because its after an apocalips and their is a new nation ovet north america. i have to read the first book though or this wont make sence to you. the nation that rules over north america wont katness dead and she and petta get a force marige and gail gets a whipping and its strange.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This app is very fun and the animation is very fluid and detailed. I love the story, the endless mode, and how addicting this app is! And it's the free app of the day to boot! Highly recommend getting this app. Kindle Fire
B005HSL626|3.0|its ok. i like it one day dont like it the next. i dont like having to slide my finger on my screen all the time becase my ds had prolbems after i did somthing like this on a game.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Interesting.  The graphics are very good.  The app responds well and graphics are smooth. Only gripe I have is that for a paid app to still have ads is not right,  even though ads are only on first page.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|it an easy past time game that is callmig. you dont have to touch your screen. you tilt your device. fun. family approved (i think that anyway).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there is so much to choose from, it is very addictive. I hate to lose  and keep going back for more. it does have a few flaws, minor ones so far. well worth the try. found some great games.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i love this amazing book. is takes place in north america after an apocalips and the new nationhas alot of mony and all of the 12 districts are really pore. the capital makes each district give 1 boy tribute and 1 gilr tribute betwween the age of 12 and 18. they then get sent to the capital to train and get new skills. then they preform thier new skill to the game makers (the people who make the rules for the humger games). then they get sent to the arenna, which is different evey year and takes 20 years to make, to fight to thier death. only 1 person lives so they all get torchered and killed by the other. the game makers have to power to kill who ever they whant how ever they want when ever they want to. so just think about it. every day teenagers throun into an arena with an unknown environment sent to fight the other to death with grousem wepons and beeing forced to watch it for \\"fun\\" or you will die too. yes i love this book and sorry if i gave it away and for miss spelled words.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|qwest part is fun and I like the power tiles.  the zoom feature is especially nice!  graphics are pretty and this game is easy to navigate on the fire. if you like mahjong and qwest games, I highly recommend this game!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Real cool app ! Addicting! Fun! only bad thing is you gotta force close it once and a while! ;) but other than that its really cool!!!
B003PIUC02|4.0|I know I will get flamed or ridiculed for this opinion, but Spartacus: Blood and Sand is probably the better and more historically accurate version that is the legend of Spartacus. Yes, the violence is over the top with the 300ish style. Yes, the sex is VERY over the top and would be considered more pornographic than anything released theatrically (especially more so than USA director cuts). But when it boils down to a depiction about the savagery of gladiators and the outlandish lifestyle of the Roman empire, this show does nail it. Nothing is held back and the viewer needs to have an open mind when watching Blood and Sand. However, anybody easily offended by bodily mutilation and sexual display NEED to stay away.<br />As I have informed many people about this show, the first episode is the most difficult to get by. It's painfully awful cheesy. Then almost immediately during the second episode, the show gets better. After the 5th, it becomes a very enticing historical drama. The life of the Roman gladiator is the real treat as you watch Spartacus forget his past and become a Legend in the Capua Arena. In my opinion, the best part of this TV series is that this story is more accurate than the famous 1960 film. If one were to watch this entirely, then go and do quick research, the viewer would understand that the writers did in fact do their research, even though still very dramatized.<br /><br />I would prefer nothing else but to own a Blu-ray release of this series. Anything below 720p for this show would never be enough to display the wonderful performances of the actors and the brilliant cinematography. Even though I watched this on Netflix, this is on my Amazon wish list to own very soon. It is of course a sad note to the late Andy Whitfield. Spartacus: Blood and Sand is officially his acting legacy. But what he left is an unforgettable performance and a story of Spartacus that made me anticipate the next series: Vengeance, with high anticipation. Entertainment fans of historical dramas particularly of the Roman Empire should not scoff or miss this.fans of historical dramas particularly of the Roman Empire should not scoff or miss this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Love the challenge of getting the unlocked games checked off. Points accumulate fast, but hard to get all games checked off. Be sure to read the directions before starting a new game. Fun! Fun! Fun! Plan on becoming addicted! !!!
1612130283|3.0|3.5 *s, God help me but I liked it. It was addictive, honestly I don't know why. I don't think I've ever rolled my eyes so much while reading a book, which is actually pretty dangerous to do around Fifty Shades.  The writing is this books, honestly, is pretty damn bad. It reads, in my opinion, very much like fan fiction. If I had been reading this as a print book I would have been completely baffled, it is very obvious it is self published. It doesn't help that I am not a fan of 1st person present tense. But either way, the writing isn't very good. I'm not talking grammar or puncuation, because I'm so bad at that myself I hardly notice, although there were a few typos. But the writing at times was very bland, often repetitive, and clinical almost.  With that being said, the emails were fantasic. I frquently had to stop myself from scimming text and jumping right to the email exchances when I saw them coming up. They were a great way to see in to Christian's POV and they were also where Ana's claws came out and she said what she was really feeling and thinking instead of her \\"inner goddess\\" *painful groan* swooning at the sight of one Mr. Grumpy Beautiful Enigmatic Sex God.  My other main problem was the heroine, Ana. Quite frankly, she was annoying. Or should I say her \\"inner goddess\\" was annoying. I swear to all that is holy I wanted to strangle the fictional bitch. Towards the end I seriously almost couldn't take having to read about this \\"inner goddess\\" and her mental cartwheels and victory dances for one more page. It was infuriatingly annoying. Which is made even more teeth grindingly worthy by the fact that I outside of that I was starting to come around to Ana. I felt for the girl. Every girl who has fallen for a guy she shouldn't have can probably relate to her. And while her actions and decisions sometimes left me questioning her high GPA overall she was starting to grow on me. Her naivete was at times tiresome but it fit her character and could actually bevery amusing. Take this for instance, (very minor spoiler...maybe...if you don't know what the book contains ;])  \\"Are you growling at me Miss Steele?  I possess a cat of my own for growlers.\\"  \\"Cat of his own? I've never seen a cat in his apartment.\\"  Man, I laughted my bottom off. Maybe I have a sick sense of humor but I found little things like that hilarious.  Christian is one sick puppy. One drop dead gorgeous, sexier than any mortal should be, sick puppy. I liked him. I can't help it. Would I ever go near someone like him in real life? Hell to the no. I'd knee him in the groin like he deserves and get a restraining order and a personal body guard. But this is fiction and we're all allowed a little guilty pleasure man, right? Right. At least that is what I'm telling myself.  The ending sucked. Not because of how it actually ended, because that left me with a FINALLY, CHICA! moment. But I felt it was so out of the blue and rushed. I didn't buy it. I didn't understand why the characters made the decisions they did for the last 20 pages or so. It seemed out of character for them both. I would have liked a little more build up and for the process to go at a more nature pace.  Over all I enjoyed this book, it was addictive unlike anything I've read in awhile. It has it's issues, a lot of them, but I'm glad I read it. And Merlin help me but I'm eager to move on the the sequels.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|When I first downloaded this book, I thought I would be reading something very interesting...kind of like an adult version of the Hunger Games. Well, the author writes of no fierce magical competition and (spoiler alert) there is no winner. What was the point of the book? Even when I finished the book I could not figure out the author's exact plot. Do not suffer through this book. It is not worth it.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a great version of mahjong I love the story and it works great on my fire I would recommend.
B0063IH60K|4.0|solitaire for kindle fire is awesome. i would recommend to anyone who likes to play. it is easy to download and play if u don't know how to.play.
B006ON41FC|5.0|good love it!!!!it is so addictive I could play it all day!!! I got the free one so but I would not buy if I. had to pay.:/
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Fun game. Plays nice on Kindle fire. I had the free version but dumped it fast because it only took you so far. Full version is ten times better. Grab it today as free ap of the day.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I will give it five stars.  Just enough challenge to make it interesting without being boring.  Good graphics and good design of the playing field.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The piece itself is fine.  It's exactly what it claims to be and does what it is supposed to do.  I felt the need to protect my Fire especially travelling as much as I do and it seems to do it well.  My only complaint and the reason it loses a star is that it seems a bit much to pay for a very simply made cover.  Other than that, no issues that I can tell.  You will have to decide for yourself if it is worth the expense.
1440503257|2.0|The side of the book is really rough. I bought this book as a gift. If it was for myself, then that would have been totally fine. The recipes in the book are not creative at all
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I purchased this knife as a replacement to the two traditional kabar knives that I snapped in half.  Kabar has a great name but the military knives used by the marines suck.  I am hard on knives and this one is a beast that will do any and all tasks that need to be done.  I see a lot of complaints that the knife is heavy and bulky.  Guess what, thats exactly how it was designed.  Its 1 lb of pure brute force that is bomb proof.  Its excellent for chopping and splitting wood, making fire bows, rabbit snares, tent stakes, feathering wood, gutting fish, skinning deer, digging, etc.  If you are expecting to whittle a horse out of a block of wood then get another knife.  No one knife will do everything but if you want a knife that will do almost anything then this is the knife you want.  Some complaints about it not being good for small tasks is just not justified.  They must not know how to use a knife.  Bringng 5 knives and an axe with you is stupid.  I want one tool with me.  I don't carry 5 luggage bags like a hollywood diva when i hike.  This is one of the heaviest items in my pack but well worth the weight.  This also isn't a combat knife and people complain about it.  Im not sure why because I personally don't plan on encountering any WW2 axis forces while hiking and camping.  If you want a more combat ready knife then get the BK7 but its not going to outperform the BK2 for survival.  It may be 0.15lb lighter and 1.75\\" longer but its 0.062\\" thinner.  I prefer the shorter, thicker, rugged and less clumsy BK2.  Anyone who complains about this knife needs to look into this one instead: [[ASIN:B002IAMLHU Kershaw Ken Onion Scallion Pocket Knife]]
0385342063|4.0|Life is lived over the airwaves, through text messages and emails and voice mails that provide the connections to the people we love...unless you happen to lose the little device that stores them all!  Poppy Wyatt never realized how essential her phone was until she lost it...on the very day that she happened to lose the heirloom emerald engagement ring that her brilliant fiance, Magnus, gave her soon after their relationship began.  Poppy can't bear the thought of living life without her lifeline and feels as if a miracle has dropped into her lap when she finds an abandoned phone in the trash.  When no one arrives immediately to claim it, Poppy engages the \\"finders keepers\\" rule and adopts it as her own.  Unfortunately, the owner Sam Roxton, doesn't agree.  Poppy uses all of her powers of persuasion to get him to reluctantly allow her to \\"share\\" the phone while she waits for news about her missing engagement ring.  As the days draw closer to Poppy's upcoming wedding, the two develop a complicated relationship of shared texts, emails and voice mails that reveal interesting aspects of their characters and lives and - seeing themselves through each others' eyes - makes them realize that their lives may not be as perfect as they once thought.  Are they each making huge mistakes in the way they deal with other people?  Sam can't understand why Poppy allows Magnus' academic family to intimidate her while Poppy grows more and more frustrated with his refusal to allow people to get close to him.  Through a series of misunderstandings, overstepped boundaries and hilarious adventures, the two come to some very surprising conclusions about themselves and each other...<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella is the master of the \\"oh-my-gosh-did-that-really-happen\\" cringe-inducing moments.  You can't help but groan and wince along with Poppy as she stumbles through her adventures...and sigh with relief when she comes out relatively unscathed!  Those hilarious moments add just the right amount of comedy to a book that, though it seems frothy on the surface, actually has a nice deeper aspect that reveals itself slowly and ensures a satisfying read.  Definite recommendation for anyone who likes chick lit with meaning!dy to a book that, though it seems frothy on the surface, actually has a nice deeper aspect that reveals itself slowly and ensures a satisfying read.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have been looking for a great mahjong app and with today's free app, Mahjong Artifacts, I have finally found it.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love listening to Christmas music during the holidays and over the years I have collected albums from different artists and this album is by far one of my favorite Christmas albums of all time! The album contains some of the old time Christmas songs (as to be expected), but it also has some great new songs that I never heard before. The whole album is pure magic! You will love this album even if you're not that much into Christmas music. It will soothe your soul.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun game that keeps you entertained. Yes the ads can be a pain but not enough to keep me from playing.  A must have for all puzzle lovers and great bargain as the faotd :)
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game. was a free app one day, and I would have happily paid for it!! I love it and my kids and I fight over who gets to play next!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is such a fun game...very addicting. the comics make it extra fun, but some were a little confusing. long story short: buy it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have been looking for a good Mahjong game for my HTC. The game is fun and easy to use. It does take up a bit of space, though, so be aware.
0439023521|5.0|This is by far my favorite book ever! I became very attached to the characters and eager to learn more about their fate.  I love her style of writing because at the end of each chapter, a twist or something new happens and it forces you to keep reading.  I would recommend this book for anyone, boys and girls from middle school to the nursing home!  My mother even read the books and loved them!  I promise you won't be disappointed if you read this book!
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Such a funny movie and I love how it makes fun of relationships. We laughed so hard while watching it and really loved the story line. Everyone can relate.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games are truly works of art. I did not buy the trilogy because of the glitches, but I got them separately. I have read the Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay 3 times. I am now on my 4th and they are still amazing. Suzanne Collins should get a Nobel Peace Prize for literature. If you really want to spark all your emotions, read these books, and be prepared to laugh, cry, gasp, flinch, shudder, and freak out. You will be rewarded with a life-changing experience.
0891419063|5.0|We picked up this book after watching The Pacific and it's a wonderful read. I am not in the military, but a military spouse, and it's a wonderful account of what the marines faced in the Pacific during WWII and a great story. I loved the honesty of the ghastly war that the  marines faced and while it's not my usual read, I have truly enjoyed reading it. You feel like you know Eugene Sledge as he talks about his journey through the war. It's brutally honest, even the bad, and that's the best part; you respect his truth, even when it's hard to read.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|This app doesn't work properly on a Vizio tablet.  The vertical coordinates are inverted and it is impossible to select tiles by touching them. You can select a tile but you have to touch elsewhere on the playing field imagining that the vertical axis has been flipped. This is both difficult and annoying.  The game buttons on the bottom of the screen are sensed properly, so I'm puzzled by why the tiles themselves have this problem. Until an update fixes this bug, this game is unplayable on the Vizio Tablet.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I never use open Feint and so would appreciate you not automatically running it. also the app freezes a lot on my EVO 3d...
B00004ST9Q|5.0|r.i.p whitney houston we love u and all your songs this is a great dvd  with lots of great music videos buy it today
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great app!  Interesting, great graphics, easy to use, challenging, but not too difficult. Keeps the grey matter from solidifying.  I will look into purchasing from G5 in the future.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's is a well made game good quality and very engaging have played just one day and I am hooked.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is the best game ever. Anybody who likes cute flying squirrels should get this game. Get the nuts and upgrade everything. get this game and go nuts!!!
B004US4K2C|5.0|Excellent launcher substitute for the Kindle Fire. No more unruly carousel. Icons could be a little larger. Overall, it is a pleasant experience.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is awesome. my brother got it for me on Saturday. but he frogot to get it for himself. I love it!
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|Mankell has created a compelling, resourceful and dogged detective in his many books.  In this telling of a series of brutal murders the revenge aspect of the killings becomes apparent and Wallender and his team pursue those leads, but Wallender is human and he can err from time to time and get sidetracked. As the case progresses Wallender must deal with his aging father, his daughter and her blossoming career, and his lady friend in Latvia.  Also, with all this as well as the murders, poor Kurt doesn't have time to get his laundry done or get his car serviced.  With Kurt Wallender, it's all about the case, the chase and the successful conclusion.  And, that's why we read about Kurt Wallender...he's all to human.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun game. Always looking forward to next level. very colorful.  Choice of levels is nice for beginers like me.  I wii cocider some of the other games that are offered.
B006ON41FC|5.0|its fun and challenging to do all the different task that it asks you to do. its also very addicting. try it you will have lots of fun!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|No ifs, ands, or buts about it.  This app is superb! I got this app nearly 30 minutes ago, and when I had the option to write a review, I thought -- &quot;Heck, this app is already getting me hooked. Why not?&quot;  And so I did.  This runs great on my Kindle Fire, no problems. Yes, there are ads when you launch it, but G5 is only advertising for their other games. We all expirience advertisings, so I wouldn't be complaining if you have television. Ads for applications aren't even x10 worse then on T.V., anyway.  5 minutes of boredom on your T.V., one second of interest on your mobile device.  Think of it that way.
B006ON41FC|4.0|awesome game very addicting. got the game for my iphone now I have it for my kindle fire I think I like it more on the kindle
B006ON41FC|5.0|very addictive.  playing it all the time. the only problem is that it is always asking for a stupid review
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Sorry to seem dumb but where do I find the walk through and do I need the sound on to play the game?  I just bought the game and there does not seem to be any info to go with it. Many thanks,
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is really a masterful use of aesthetics and a pleasing-puzzling game experience.  The games are always pleasant, sometimes challenging, and occasionally maddening.  But eventually, each one is conquered and one can enjoy the gentle tones that soothingly play in the background.  Kudos to the developers!
B001P06GX4|5.0|My boys, 4 and 6, love this game and have for awhile.  The strategy side of it is brilliant and teaches great skills.  It's also easy and fast so it holds kid's attention quite well.  A must have in your toy arsenal.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|The adds are just crazy. It's as if the app is free, but they want money to watch adds.  This is a total rip off.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the games. so many to choose from.  Totally addicting. my kids love the games too. I like that there are so many different ones.
B006ON41FC|5.0|really fun game....gets challenging quick...love it, just wish it didn't start all the way from the beginning each time.  cool since it was free as well.
B00006LLNU|3.0|Okay, I've never heard them before. I found () in a used CD bin for $3.99 so I bought it today. I listened to it on the way home. Interesting music, I can't really describe it yet, but I enjoyed it, oddly. The real puzzler is this: All the reviews I've read so far have listed the track titles as Untitled. When I put the disc in my cd player in the car (it's a Sirius Sat radio and has a screen which shows all the album info) the title of the album is listed as Secret Pint. The titles of all the songs have the word \\"Goat\\" in them somewhere. Track one is \\"I Love Goats.\\" two is \\"Goats Love Me\\"  etc. some more disturbing than the others. Could this have been a joke? The guy programming the digital code just added these titles to mess with people? What gives? Anyone know?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! I really enjoy the story that goes with the game. It keeps it entertaining.
B005G4TJUC|2.0|A boring Nasa storyline that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to begin with, sam gets a new girlfriend and is trying to find a job, along the way we still have annoying charectors such as the mom, the asian guy, some dumb momments with sam and his boss. movie is too long with no story, no charector development, with no action until the last 40 minutes and this is a 2 and half hour movie. If the robots had fought on the moon I think It would have been more interesting and a different location, instead we get a main villian robot that is not memorable, a repeat of the robots fighting and causing destruction in the city. special effects are amazing but it can't save how poorly written this movie is. its all visual with no substance.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video works! Now this is coming from someone who is very out of shape. I've seen reviews that say its repetitious and sort of boring. Well for me I set my goal per level. Starting with level 1 my first goal was to complete it on moderate with no stopping and minimal stress. Then do the same with level 2 and so on. Again because of my starting point being not at all in shape, by the time the 30 days had passed I did not get bored with the video because it actually took me 30 days to finish it.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|All the underworld movies are entertaining, well written and this new chapter in the series is no exception. selene wakes up 12 years later after being cryogenically frozen to discover a future she is unfamilar with and learns she has a daughter hybrid that the lycans are sought after. Very entertaining, amazing visuals, edge of your seat action, great special effects, these movies just keep getting better and better.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I liked this app a lot when I first got it. the interface was very well designed.  but for the last week all I get are &quot; force close&quot; messages every time I try go run it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great way to relax and spend some down time, graphics are clear and beautiful too.  worth trying out, works well on kindle fire
B002SSUQFG|2.0|The watch worked great for about a week then it just stopped. Amazon has provided me with return authorization papers even though I didn't have original receipt that was sent with the watch. I've been ordering from amazon for a while and this is the first time I've had to return anything.... I'll write a follow up if something goes awry. BTW, I have 6.75 inch wrists and some may think it  big enough but I think not.  Any bigger wrist than mine & this definitely wouldn't have adequate size.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Wow!  Very entertaining with awesome graphics and a good story line.  Its my first time playing Mahjong and it was very addicting.  The tutorial was very helpfull with many examples  to help you along the way.  Thank you for are great entertaining game.  Well made with superb graphics.  Keep up the great work.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|its simple to use and very fun. great animation as well. if you enjoy mahjong this ia a must have
B005K17RU0|5.0|better than the weather.com app, radar and up to date like the extended forecast with hour by hour weather. good graphics
B006ON41FC|3.0|I like the game but it should have different levels you can play and beat then it would be more fun rather then doing the same thing over and over again
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has a variety of games...passes the time. pretty easy to get a lot of points to open new games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Love the variety of games and they are fun.  But after we've passed them it takes forever to earn more points to open more games.  I wish that once you passed the games it automatically opened the next game.  But it is still fun to play and it is challenging and competitive.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I guess they must of heard how unhappy everyone is... I didn't see any ads and I love the game! It  works great on my nook color. I love the G5 games, glad this was a free one today.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love this free app. It gives all that is promised and the ads are hardly noticeable. I really think this app is worth downloading for anyone.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A little difficult on my 4 inch screen but still very nice. Full screen mode would be excellent. I do enjoy Mahjong
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great fun, very addictive. Wish the graphics were a tad better, but everything runs smoothly and that's more important. More stuff in the shop!
0316286850|2.0|Not very impressed with this or any of the books I ordered from Kevin Aucoin..... I have read much better.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Whether or not Lana Del Ray does decide to make another record, this is a very good debut and a sign of good things to come.  My advice for the listener would be to go into this record as if it is someone you have never heard before- not the Lana of all this hype- for if you are able to do that, you can truly appreciate this album.  Very good feel from start to finish- a pop album but I'm going to make up a word here- \\"glazed pop.\\"  There is very catchy songs on here with simplistic but cool lyrics.  Also, there is a good bit of upbeat songs which is good because after hearing \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Born to Die\\" which are both good, I was worried it was going to be a slow record.  The Highlights for me are \\"Diet Mountain Dew,\\" \\"National Anthem,\\" and \\"Off to the Races.\\"  4 out of 5 because there are some songs on here I could do without.  Good debut though.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I like it. Do not mind the splash screen that promotes other games, play is smooth and engaging I recommend to any fan of Mahjong
B0054LRR3S|3.0|Very cool vibe from this album but there isn't too much replayability for the album itself.  There are some great tracks on here though.  \\"Wildfire\\" is probably the highlight along with \\"Trials of the Past\\" and \\"Sanctuary.\\"  Good dance tunes and background music for a party.  Three stars because there is nothing fantastic here in terms of an album, but a couple great songs scattered over a beat influenced set.
B006ON41FC|5.0|OMG it is soooooo fun I am addicted to this game. At first I sucked but now Im pretty good!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great Game! A lot of fun. Very smooth operation from my phone. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Until MS office itself comes to android, this is by far the best office suite app for the job. Looking forward to future updates to see how it keeps improving.
B003L77G06|5.0|This show is hilarious!  My family and I love watching it.  The characters are very real, and the situations could really happen.  And they make good choices (eventually).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game or games nothing bad to say about it! get get gget get get getgetget get get get get
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is very addicting! Absolutely love it! The only problem is I have played it so much that i already beat everything, got all the stars and all the medals/ribbons. Needs more levels!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is so much fun. If you're a gamer,  this app is right 4 you. I TOTALY RECOMMEND IT. BY NOW
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Anyone else wonder why this app as well as the second installment are free in the google market. Additionally, the file is 1/4 the size.  Hmmmmm.............
B0058P7KUA|5.0|good game id give it four thumbs up  i had that many.  i thought the humor was great five stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is tons of fun! my wife and I have been competing and having loads of fun.<br />flying high and collecting nuts is a blast. we have gone nuts for &quot;Going Nuts&quot;!
B004GYY714|2.0|its ok but it just is hard to find stations on it and it doesnt have all the stations and its annoying and stupid
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is cool it works great on my kindle fire keep up the good work hi hi hi hi h
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's fun. I wouldn't have paid $5 for it, thanks free app of the day! The ads r just lice if dev's other games.  Tutorial is mandatory,but very quick about 1 min.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It is a great game. Stimulates the brain cells. It was very easy to learn and you get to compete against yourself.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This was a challenging build...took at least 23 hours to build. It is simply HUGE! Yes it is expensive, but from a collector's point of view; it is also an investment. A total of 23 minifigs, super cool rooms straight from all of the original Star Wars movies' DEATH STAR!! It is a lot of fun!! A word of advice: separate all of the loose pieces into \\"like\\" piece piles to speed up your build time. You will thank me for this.  Fun for all ages.  Worth the time & $.....  BUY IT BEFORE THEY RETIRE THIS AWESOME SET!!!!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food, Inc. is necessary viewing for every health conscious individual on the planet.  They show what's happening within our food production industry.  They expose the things the mass producers don't want you to know about because you might stop eating their products.  As you watch the movie, you won't want to believe this really happens in our country, but the evidence is right in front of your eyes.  It was only a short time ago when I believed our government agencies had our best interest at heart.  Maybe I was naive, but I certainly wasn't alone.  This video will show you what & who can be bought when you have big bucks to throw around.  It will also reveal how we've been sold a load of \\"you know what\\" in nice pretty packaging, but the manufacturers don't want you to know what you're really eating.  You know what's really scary?  If the food industry continues along the path of the mass producers, we'll be eating only what they say we can eat regardless of its nutritional value.  If you want to have healthy options, you need to see this video and get the facts.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I was having a huge issue with the app crashing recently, but the most recent update fixed that, at least for now.  Nice app, advertisements are small and unobtrusive.  Auto updates weather report with Internet access.  Yes, the app may not shut down, but I don't find that to be a bother.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|I AM A DOORS FAN FROM WAY BACK--WHEN I HEARD ABOUT A 40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF LA WOMAN I HAD TO HAVE IT--THE ALTERNATE VERSIONS OF MANY OF THEIR SONGS WAS VERY INTERESTING--ALSO THERE WERE TITLES THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT ARE AMAZING--GOTTA GET IT IF YOU ARE A DOORS FAN
B006ON41FC|5.0|best game ever....challenging goals lots of game play. great game for adults and kids...in my house everyone plays it...best app ive downloaded period...
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love my case cover. It is tan wth gold trim and it fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. I'm not sure wether it is leather or not, but it sure feels like leather. It is exactly what I wanted and I would order it again. I think anyone would be pleased with it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|when you look at it it don't look that fun but trust me, if you get it youll enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great I love it it has easy and hard games its absolutely great!!!! you can play by yourself or with people I love it to pass time!!!!

B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun games, me and my 4 year old love this app!! old school style games! my favorite one is the rocket ship.games.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My grandchildren do not watch TV and when their parents said they would love to have these Harry Potter movies I sent them immediately and they get to watch one a week and their mom reads a Harry Potter book at night one chapter at a time.  They love Harry Potter and I get very excited when they decribe parts of the movie to me each week on the phone.
B006ON41FC|4.0|it was a fun game but needs some more diversity. i enjoyed the different suits and had fun hitting the trees
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Loved every minute of it. Wish the cd was the exact repuca of the DVD version though! But that's ok.... Can make my own copy if need be!
B0063IH60K|4.0|had a good time playing it better than watching same old boring Tv shows. I really find it entertaining to play
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This item was exactly a promised.  Received quickly.  Works exactly as advertised for a better price than you can pay outsite at a store.
B000X107GI|5.0|I needed 2 for my garage door openers and these did the trick.  Unbelieveable price and I stuck the extra batteries in the frig to extend their shelf time.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|OK. After reading some poor reviews, let me say that true movie buffs will find this film refreshing from a directorial view. Gosling's character is eerily captivating. The plot was solid and smart. One thing that detracted from the movie was the 80's style music (about a third of the film). Oh...and one last comment - some scenes may be too graphic for some viewers.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|eclipse is definately in my top ten films, i recommend this to anyone who is either a fan of the werewolves or the vampires, or like me, both. it shows each side and gives a great idea of how they are having to come together to be stronger than their mutual enemy, the newborns. i also think that the character of carlisle really begins to shine through in this movie, having been more of a supporting part in the previous films. i think ive realised how much he's my favourite character as of this film, and recommend watching the other movies to focus on his part, and see if he becomes more of a pronounced favourite. Great film.  Team Carlisle!
0375842209|4.0|~4.5/5<br />I'd heard about this book before, but never what it was about. I'd heard that it starts weird, and that it was dark, or something. But I didn't know until we started it in book club what it was actually about. And that the only reason it was weird is because it's narrated by Death. Which I don't really think is all that weird.<br />It's set during World War 2, which made me a little wary. I've only read and seen a few things set during that time, and I'm usually not a big fan of war or historical novels. But this one was different. What with them being Germans, and secretly not liking how things are going. Not actively fighting (for the most part), just living their lives. And hiding a Jew in their basement. The main thing that caught my attention, though, is that it's told by Death.<br />Death is one of my favorite things about this story, and how well he was done. Writing this book from Death's point-of-view was kind of a brilliant idea on Zusak's part. He's his own character, cynical and haunted but also unconditionally interested in humans, and he knows everything. I really liked how he was written, and how he would go forward, and warn you about things or tell you how things with certain characters would turn out, and then go back to the present with Liesel. Death is a person, just like everyone else in this story, and he doesn't kill anyone, just carries them to wherever they go after. The way it was told reminded me a bit of Mary & Max, a claymation movie that I saw recently that was also really good (I would suggest it).<br />And all of the characters were really well done. There's Liesel, the mostly main character, who's somewhat innocent but fun, and who loves to read and kind of 'steals' books (only not how you would think), and who cares and is smart and tough and a little impulsive. And there's Rudy, who is adventurous and impulsive and athletic and loves Liesel, and who I also kind of love. And Liesel's Papa, who's so sweet to Liesel and genuine and nice and not a Nazi. And then there's Liesel's Mama, who is crude and curses at everyone but still loves them and cares. Oh, and Max, who is Jewish and so has to hide, and is afraid but gets close to Liesel and makes her these sweet books, with perfectly amateurish artwork. There are so many different characters, and they all have their own story and personality, and they are all great. And I just love them all.<br />And the end, particularly the scenes between Liesel and her Papa, and Liesel and Rudy, are so sweet and overwhelmingly sad. I felt like crying at them (and I am not a crier). But I guess I should have suspected that, what with the subject matter and all. I still didn't want them to happen, though.<br />There is so much to this book. It's not a small book, or in any way a quick read, especially because of the length, but also because there is just so much to it.

It's...yea, sad, but also realistic, and honest, and imaginative, creative. So many things. And it's so good.<br />It's just a great book, in many ways.

B004K7HMJ6|1.0|The only song I could listen to the end was Who you are. Everything else in the album I couldn't even get past the first 30 seconds of the song. I found her voice to be very annoying. Annoying to the point where if i close my eyes it sounds like nails on a chalkboard. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone else. In fact I think this is one of the most horrible albums I listened to and I won't be listening to her anymore.
086571701X|4.0|I started building my system last fall and I thought I was getting my feet wet, but now I know I was drowning.  After I knew I was in trouble, I bought Sylvia's book and I am so glad I did.  Get a hi-liter ready when you read this book as you will need it. There are lots of tid-bits in it that I didn't know. I had fish, tomatoes, lettuce, and cabbage, growing. She confirmed I didn't  really screw things up in my system, but she did confirm some of the things I did right, and answered questions I still had.  This is an excellent book for the beginner. It will tell you everything you need to know. You can take that to the bank.  After I had read the book (more than once), I asked a question in the forum that she has on her website. Little did I expect, I received the answer from Sylvia herself. She really seems sincere, and definitely knows her stuff. Buy her book, and go to her web site and join her group. They have a wealth of information there.  I would have given this book a five star rating, but I didn't like the fact that the outer 2 inches of the pages are not printed. This puts the page numbers to where it is hard to thumb through trying to find a particular page.  I hope this helps those of you that are really going to take the plunge, as I have.....John  Spell check by Pat
B005B0QYMM|3.0|Overall, this is a good movie if you like to get scared.  The movie does drag on slowly, a lot in the beginning and some all throughout.  I wouldn't recommend watching it alone and in the dark...unless you're ok with the potential nightmares.  I enjoy scary movies and this had some scare to it.  I only wished it had less of a 'can we get on with it already' feeling in the beginning.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|My boyfriend and I play this pretty often and enjoy it.  The game has crashed once or twice, but it hasn't been a huge problem.

0385344228|5.0|I LOVED this book!!  I couldn't put it down and it was one of those books that you think you have figured out and then you finish the book and think, \\"well I didn't see that coming\\"!!  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the thrill of a page turner type read. I will read more from this author!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|So much fun! ! Works great on Kindle Fire!!  No problem with download and what's even bwtter is it was FREE!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Who?  Deez nuts!  Do you like tapes or cd's?  Well see Deez nuts!  I like it but it does slow down and freeze from time to time on my DROID x.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is the first book which I read by e-book on my iPhone.  I could enjoy and finish it in one spell.  This book includes not only the bright side but also the dark side of this unparalleled individual.  Steve has created various epoch-making things for the world and simultaneously done various unreasonable things to the people around him.  He tried drugs in his youth, did not acknowledge his daughter at first, betrayed his friends, and deceived his benefactors.  Not everyone likes him, but most will be curious about this great person unequaled throughout history.  I find that the origin of innovation is enthusiasm, enthusiasm is passed along, and the aggregation of enthusiasm creates true innovation.
B006ZBRMOU|1.0|I don't get it. All my friends are in thrall to this  series. Five star reviews abound. I read the whole darn book. Every word. It's a chick flick, porn cartoon.  I guess that doean't do it for me. Every other description of the smoldering in his eyes, the changes in his eye color, the looks of wanting on her face. Oh please. Nauseating.
0674057929|5.0|This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read.  I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book.  Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories.  I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time.  This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better.  Buy It!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great bible....I love that it has all the different versions...I would recommend it to anyone...you have to try it for yourself
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great twist on a classic game. I predict I will be up late playing when I should be sleeping! Thanks Amazon for giving this app free to us kindle addicts.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The story adds to the game and makes you want to keep playing. The tile set changing keeps you interested too.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This is by far the best movie i have ever seen in my life. There is something about this that i just love. It teaches us a very important less. I'm not going to say what it is because it's going to ruin the entire movie. I love the last 10 min of the movie. If you have a doubt about this movie you shouldn't. Buy it and watch it because you won't regret it once. I know i didn't
B0067Q42BY|5.0|super fun little game. my personal experience does not match all of the negative ones, and I would recommend to a friend. used on a kindle fire.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have a kindle fire and this game is great. ive seen many reviews about the &quot;ads&quot; on this game, but to counter them, I'll say that the developer adding a suggestion to play their other games isn't horrible.  Its only the first page and it doesn't hinder game play. Game play is fantastic. Thanks to the developers!!
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I find it interesting that no one mentions the ads in reviews published before today. Are there no ads if you paid the $4. 99 before it was the free daily app?
B005LZW8FO|2.0|While the story potential did exist with this movie, it fell flat. Even the filmography left a lot to be desired in that it was monotonous throughout. We rented it expecting it to be about the girl's journey to the second earth, instead it was about her 'self-journey'. I found the relationship with John to be creepy and found Rhoda to be remarkably selfish. Would I watch it again, no. And did I pick up the laptop halfway through and start surfing the net, yes. Had the story pacing been better, it would have worked somewhat. And just when it was starting to get good with her faced with the 'other' her, the movie ended.
B005V20JKI|3.0|love this game but most recent update wiped all my progress. pretty mad since I was on the last level.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|August 1942. The United States Marine Corps lands in force on the island of Guadalcanal and begins the long, gruelling campaign of 'island-hopping'. Over the next three years they will take the fight against Japanese forces on islands all across the western Pacific, drawing ever closer to the Japanese home islands and victory.<br /><br />The Pacific is HBO's companion series to their acclaimed 2001 series Band of Brothers. Like the earlier series, The Pacific follows American soldiers across a single theatre of war (albeit a far vaster one). Unlike Band of Brothers, which was able to concentrate on a single company of the 10st Airborne and cover its journey in some detail (the whole series, bar the opening training sequence, only spanned nine months), The Pacific is rather diffuse in its focus. It covers a period of three years and the almost modular nature of the war in the Pacific (multiple major battles raging simultaneously on islands hundreds of miles apart) means it is impossible to focus on one unit throughout the whole war. The series copes with the problem by dividing the narrative into three storylines following three marines (John Basilone, Bob Leckie and Eugene Sledge), but this ultimately proves to be a move with mixed success.<br /><br />Plaudits first. The Pacific is visually stunning. Filmed on location on Australia's Pacific coast, the series employs impressive location filming, practical special effects and CGI enhancements to depict WWII combat on-screen more viscerally and in a more convincing manner even than Band of Brothers. The Pacific really does look and sound like a movie, especially on Blu-Ray, and as an audio/visual experience is always impressive. The lead actors - Joseph Mazzello, James Badge Dale and Jon Seda as Sledge, Leckie and Basilone respectively - are impressive and are lent able support by the likes of William Sadler (as the infamous Colonel 'Chesty' Puller) and Rami Malek, who gives an offbeat but fascinating performance as 'Snafu' Shelton. In terms of direction, production values and acting, the series is overwhelmingly impressive.<br /><br />The issues arise from structural choices for the series. The Pacific War was a very different beast to the Western Front of WWII in Europe, spanning vaster distances and featuring the marines, navy and army fighting simultaneously on different fronts. An immediate drawback of only having ten episodes to tell this story is that other units and services outside the Marine Corps get short shrift. None of the immense naval battles in the theatre (Midway, the Coral Sea etc) are really mentioned and the massive American bombing campaign against Japan is not featured. There are some nods to the other services (the Battle of Savo Island is briefly watched by the marines from the shore; aerial assaults on Japanese positions are occasionally shown) but the focus is squarely on the marines.<br /><br />Even this is problematic. To get across the scale of the conflict, HBO conflates three separate stories together. John Basilone's story allows them to show life on the home front (Basilone was sent home after Guadalcanal, initially serving as a PR representative to raise money for the war and later as a marine instructor before returning to the field during the battle for Iwo Jima), whilst Bob Leckie is used to cover the initial stages of the fighting and also the role of Australia in the conflict. After Leckie is wounded and forced to return home, Eugene Sledge steps up as our principal POV character and we see most of the latter stages of the war through his eyes. This baton-passing approach to the narrative sounds good but ultimately feels disjointed, as the three soldiers' paths never cross (aside a fictitious brief meeting between Sledge and Leckie). It also complicates things by giving us three different sets of supporting characters to also get to know, which is a tall order for just ten episodes.<br /><br />Which isn't to say that what we are left withis still not compelling. The actors do a great job of selling their characters' respective storylines: Leckie is left on the front lines a little too long and begins suffering from battle fatigue; Basilone is tired of being hailed a hero at home whilst his friends are still fighting and is anxious to return to the front; and Sledge is angry at missing out the start of the war due to poor health and is keen to prove himself, only to ultimately start losing perspective as the gruelling months of combat unfold. These are familiar storylines, but are given added depth and weight by being true (all three marines are real, and Leckie and Sledge's memoirs provide the basis for the series).<br /><br />The overwhelming feeling of the series is one of despair. The fighting is savage and without quarter, and the marines often feel that their fighting and dying over specks of land in the middle of nowhere is pointless. There is a lack of any type of grand strategic overview which is true to the experience of the soldiers on the ground. Notably, there is no equivalent to the Why We Fight episode of Band of Brothers (where the 101st liberates a concentration camp and their horrific experiences harden their resolve to help destroy the Nazi regime). The marines are left feeling bereft of a purpose, which makes the horrors they experience strike home even harder. It's no wonder that many of them are shown breaking down or needing urgent time away from the front to reorient themselves. HBO should be congratulated for not downplaying these angles, but it often makes for very hard viewing.<br /><br />The Pacific (****) is ultimately worth watching. It's a stunning production that makes some hard comments about war and its ultimate savagery, even when a war is worth fighting. It doesn't glorify war and shows its horrors in full force, which can make for hard viewing, but the superior acting and writing make it compelling. Structurally the series is disjointed, and would have benefitted from a tighter focus on maybe just one or two of the marines featured. Extending it to three stretches the story almost to breaking point. However, once you adjust to the structural issues the series is an impressive piece of work.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far I am liking it. It definately is a good thing to do to pass the time. Sometimes too much time has gone by.
0553381695|5.0|Not much new to say that others haven't written, but I didn't mind the length or pace. I really enjoy the characters.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I heard about this book on one of my fav blogs & when I looked for it on Amazon, I hesitated to buy it.  I thought it was pricey for a kindle book, so I got the sample.  I've been hooked since.  I couldn't stopped reading this book.  It's so different & the author keeps you drawn in.  There are so many story lines, all intertwined even though you don't know it from the beginning.  It's exciting & like nothing I've ever read.  I highly recommend it.
B005LBN7WQ|5.0|This is my 12th full length cd of this fantastic Quartet. Their greatest appeal for me lies in their choice of songs - which they always delivered excellently. They stayed with the same winning formula over their 14 year lifespan, and while they deserve the break (if that's what they want) then we should grant them that.<br />I am however still sad that there will be no more new Westlife releases. I always imported their releases from the UK, because they were sadly very badly neglected in the US; why, I don't know.<br /><br />If you like & enjoy melodious songs that stay zinging in your head, then look no furhter than Westlife. This double CD retrospective is awesome! I miss songs from their \\"World Of Our Own\\" CD which I would have included on a greatest hits set, especially \\"Drive\\" & \\"To Be Loved By You\\". Their rendition of The Judds' hit, \\"Love Can Build A Bridge\\" far surpasses the original in all aspects, and is a staple on my turntable, and should also have been on this package. Find this track on 2006's \\"The Love Album\\". I also fail to see why \\"How To Break A Heart\\" from 2009's \\"Where We Are\\" album was left off this collectioin. And the Burt Bacharach/Hal David composition \\"Please Stay\\" which (I believe) was only released on the cd single \\"Safe\\" is an unbelieveable gem. If you're not familiar with this beauty, then I recommend you buy the \\"Safe\\" cd single (while still available in the UK).<br /><br />And to boot it all, they threw in a DVD with many of their awesome early videos - most dating from the days they were a quintet before Brian McFadden left the group in 2004.<br />If you are not familiar with this brilliant once-a-boy-band, now an adult male quartet, buy this 2CD + DVD set while it is still available. I give it very high marks - probably 9.5 out of 10. (The missing 0.5 is for the absence of the missing songs listed above.)<br /><br />Thank you Mark, Shane, Nicky & Kian.... your music will live forever with your many ardent fans like me.

1932735410|5.0|For passing the exam, I studied to the PMBOK book and other exam books. With the hindsight, this book was enough to pass the exam.<br /><br />There are exam prep questions. Perhaps you may find that you cannot agree with all the answers and justifications given by the author. However, it is good to further think the questions over and improve your understandings, although still you may find you cannot agree. I am still using this book as a reference by having it on my side.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|I was looking for a Mahjong game for my Kindle and saw the promote for this one. I haven't gotten all the way through yet, but so far it is relatively good. It's a bit overdone -- when I play Mahjong, I just want to match tiles. I don't need all the fancy story nonsense, but it is obvious that is thrown in to get you to buy other games. Still, not a bad addition to your Kindle if you like games.

B003JTHTZS|1.0|Found this for only $1 [thankfully] at a library sale; looked at Amazon reviews before buying and oh, my, were any above 2 generous stars wrong.  A dollar thrown away.  Must admit my fault re decision to purchase as, on the Amazon page for the book there was a tip off:  \\"In the bestselling tradition of Doctor Zhivago and Sophie's Choice, a sweeping epic of Russia from the last days of the Tsars to today's age of oligarchs -- by the prizewinning author of...\\"  \\"Bestselling\\" and \\"sweeping tradition\\" plus \\"prizewinning author\\" should have been neon light alerts to drop the book and walk away.  I noted the warnings, did not heed [as in watching a thriller and wanting to yell at the young woman, \\"Don't you hear the change in background music?  Don't open that door!\\"].  Shame on me.  Ditto for noting that Amazon had lumped \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" and \\"Sophie's Choice\\" together into a single genre. Shame on me, again.  Enough mea culpas.  This book is just awful.  After about two pages that read okeydokey, I began the rest of the book.  And I had two thoughts:  [1] that this was just a hideous translation from the Russian [of course not, silly] or [2] that I had mysteriously gotten a book with the same title and by the same author that was not the one that the 4-5 star Amazon reviewers had read [of course not, silly].  Then, I got to thought #3:  it was written as a send-up/take-off/parody of a \\"great\\" Russian novel.  Tolstoy & Co. rolling in their graves.  The language, descriptors, style, pace, dialogue are abysmal, at best.  I am a certified bookaholic and rarely even donate books to the libary.  Have thrown away a few in my life, which I will do in this case - I want to save someone else from forking out $1.
B004X80QNG|4.0|This is a good app and a nice alternative to the many other calendar apps I've tried. I don't find myself using it nearly as much as I'd like solely because there isn't a widget. Go for it guys, you could be a real contender.

B0006N2EZ0|4.0|The Bodyguard was a work of brilliance. Whitney Houston's performance in the movie was phenomenal, there was not a moment in the film where she wasn't at her best, I feel that she made a huge impact in her movie debut. There's really not much else that I can say about this film other than it was fantastic. When I heard the news of Whitney's  death that Saturday evening, I was stunned and saddened beyond belief as was everyone else who heard it.  I can only say that we lost one of the greatest singers of our lifetime and I doubt that we will see another talented performer like her again. For all her flaws and imperfections, she was still a beautiful person who will never be forgotten and her influence will play a role in encouraging other female singers to follow in her footsteps. Out of all of her great songs that I've heard over the years, \\"One Moment In Time\\" is the track that I will remember her for. She sang her heart out on that single with such heartfelt emotion that I wind up with a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes everytime I hear it. May God welcome her into His heavenly kingdom and give her eternal peace, and may He comfort Whitney's family(particularly her daughter Bobbi Christine)in their time of unimaginable grief. As for her detractors who recently posted some of the most vile, hateful reviews about her on  amazon.com, hang your heads in shame and may God forgive you for what you've said. Fly to the angels Miss Houston,  for God has set you free.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is such a great book, and I enjoyed every page. It has so many different elements - history, suspense, and romance - what a great read!! Pleasantly surprised as I wasn't sure what to expect. It's worth your time!
0545265355|5.0|The hunger games trilogy is a great set to read.  Read the first book in record time and after finishing it, set down and ordered the set the next morning.  I would not suggest starting to read this if you are busy, because you cannot put them down!  It took a little while to get into the first book, but then I was off and running!  Could not wait for my order to arrive to read the second.  Was pulled right back into the story for remaining 2 books.  Same thing happened to my daughter and husband. (It usually takes my husband MONTHS to read a book) I do not usually like fantasy type books, but these were outstanding!

B0071T5PN0|5.0|As a life long Van Halen fan I could not be happier with any album than I am with A Different Kind of Truth. This is the heaviest Van Halen album ever, but it is also the funkiest, tightest, and most fun album the band has ever released. Each song reveals details to the careful listener that show this album was crafted with care and with a renewed enjoyment of the music itself. Eddie's MXR flanger, soaring Van Halen backing vocals, and raked chords are all here. Honeybabysweetiedoll is a milestone for Eddie; the song absolutely shreds and yet he still has inserted into it some of the most soulful and dare I say subtle solos of his career. David Lee Roth's lyrics have found a maturity not before seen in his work. His songs connect with the human spirit from the opening track and throughout the album he delivers lines that are thought provoking and laugh out loud hilarious. The Trouble With Never seamlessly melds tight funk with classic Van Halen riffs, classic Van Halen background vocals, the classic Van Halen \\"good time all the time\\" ethos, and the band's reinvigorated approach to its music. This track also displays Wolfgang Van Halen's undeniable talents as a first-class bass guitarist and backing vocalist. He and his uncle Alex Van Halen, one of rock's all-time greatest drummers, are a tightly coordinated and relentlessly driving rhythm unit throughout.  ADKOT represents an expert blending of classic Van Halen with a new sense of excitement. It is the kind of album that stands up start to finish and in this reviewer's opinion it is the best studio work done by any iteration of Van Halen.

0062119044|4.0|This is one of the most captivating and disturbing novels I've read. It's brilliantly constructed and unbelievably well-written, with dynamic and complex characters and a narrator with an infinite offering of razor-sharp insights. This is not so much a drama as a horror story. We watch as, brick by brick, a life is dismantled, a life most anyone would have wanted before it all went to hell. The suspense is riveting and the protagonist Eva intriguing in her resilience, her unwavering commitment to endure. The refusal, however, on the part of everyone, and particularly Eva's husband, to face the obvious and do something besides talk about Kevin is maddening, and by the end, just ridiculous. If ever there were a case for birth control and the choice to remain childless, this book makes it. It's a very disturbing tale I know I'll think about and be haunted by for a long time to come.

B004LROUNG|4.0|This is actually the first John Grisham novel I have ever read. I don't have any prior man-love to influence my feelings about the story. It was a good read, not great. The story kept a decent pace with humorous bits along the way. It was fairly predictable, but still enjoyable. I read fiction to be entertained and to pick up random pieces of knowledge and this novel delivered both of those.
B0015DROBO|5.0|THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is fraught with gripping suspense, and captivating to the very end. The storyline is a work of art. The author created a wonderful mix of characters. Well written, brilliant, and a must read. This is a memorable book that you will never forget.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read a lot of Science Fiction but mostly space opera, the more aliens, space battles, and starships the better. I also rarely write reviews. I was waiting for the release of some more books in a couple of series I have been reading and thought I would read this to kill time while I waited. I read the reviews and thought what the heck, this isn't really my thing but this should last a couple of weeks. It lasted two days! The plot grabs you, the characters are amazing and it keeps you on the edge of your seat in anticipation! The only problem I had with this book was putting it down! It's worth every penny spent and then some! I really really hope Mr. Howey has plans to continue this series! A must read!!
B004CGUC06|4.0|Okay, I'll admit right off that I am not a Fellini fanatic.  I haven't watched his work in the past with a critical eye, nor have I made a study of his habits, tendencies, world-view, etc.  So I watched AMARCORD with essentially fresh eyes, knowing only that it was considered enough of a world classic to be presented on Bluray by Criterion.  I'm not sure I understand why it's a classic.  But it certainly was enjoyable.  Full of unbridled energy, unconcerned with narrative coherence and clearly dedicated to celebrating naughty fun, AMARCORD is a visual feast.  Allegedly, Fellini said \\"Amarcord\\" means \\"I remember\\"...but it does not.  Much like the film feels very much like a recollection a childhood gone by...but clearly is NOT realistic.  It is set in an Italian coastal village during the early fascist era (before WWII).  We basically follow one year in the life of this little town.  The camera focuses primarily on one extended family, but also visits with several other characters.  I hesitate to use the word \\"character\\" since what most of the citizens of this town are is \\"caricatures.\\"  Each actor is a visual extreme.  Whether the irate father who yells far more than is realistic (and has a HUGE mole on his bald head), or the garishly dressed town trollop...no one in the film rings quite true.  The best I can describe it is:  imagine a full grown man remembering the town of his youth, but using the world-view and libido of a teen aged boy who is simply dying to lose his virginity.  AMARCORD is full of fart jokes, crude sex jokes, and has a teen's fixation on large breasts and general mischief.  Apparently, this village was just a swirling mass of horny people!  This is not to say that Fellini has made an art house AMERICAN PIE...the movie is too cunning to be dismissed so simply.  It is so evocative of a \\"simpler\\" time...when bonfires were held in the village square to celebrate the arrival of spring, when the whole town puts to sea in rowboats with the hope of spotting a giant cruise ship coming by, when the church ran the moral show and when fascism was still mostly harmless pomp & circumstance.  We feel the pride of the people in their town and in their country (still less than 100 years old at the time).  As we follow the main characters around, we get to know them at small family gatherings, at major occasions, at weddings, at funerals, at school & work.  The entire movie is a string of incidents, only held together because we're seeing the same people over and over.  It's like we've been invited as guests for the year and our casual wanderings through the village sometimes take us to momentous happenings and other times to trivial scenes.  And occasionally, a \\"professorial\\" character will ride on his bike into our view and speak directly to us...just as though we were tourists who needed a little perspective.  AMARCORD simply does a fabulous job of capturing a time and place, as well as the character of that time & place.  It rambles often, but never runs out of steam.  It has great forward momentum all the time, and you never know what's going to happen next because it's a series of sketches.  Visually, it's quite stunning (and the BluRay is awesome) and it features some great music.  The performances are quite unrealistic, but they are all very consistent with the tone Fellini is clearly aiming for.  The movie feels utterly loose and random...yet it is clearly under the director's complete control.  To me, the \\"classic\\" label is a bit puzzling.  It's a well-made film, but seems like such a trifle too.  I don't really glean a \\"greater meaning \\" from it, nor do I find it to make some universal statement.  It's too garish and specific for that.  I give the film very high marks for achieving its own peculiar aims so well...but can't quite put it into the pantheon of 5-star films either.  The Criterion edition is stellar (although the commentary and included essay don't really enlighten as to the meaning of the film...theyfocus more on Fellini, and how his life compares to the life on the film, and how the film fits his overall body of work).  The video is superb and the sound is excellent.  Subtitles are a little better than usual (sometimes Criterion has shockingly bad subtitles.)
1439102813|5.0|This is the story of Alice Howland, a brilliant 50 year old cognitive psychology Harvard professor.  She has published articles and lectured around the world, the wife of John, a successful scientist and together they have 3 children.  An attorney married to an attorney, Tom a college student and Lydia is an actress.<br /><br />Alice begins to experience moments of forgetting and confusion which she chalks up to perhaps being from menopause, aging, her busy professional life, too much stress, not enough sleep etc.  Some of these moments include searching for hours for her Blackberry charger which is always plugged in the electrical socket right beside the bed, and a jog in Harvard Square which she is so familiar with, she suddenly becomes disoriented and now can't find her way back home.  Her memory comes back and she returns home.<br /><br />She was invited to be a guest speaker at Stanford to kick off the cognitive psychology fall colloquium series.  She has no trouble getting there and when she is introduced, she begins her 50 minute talk. She loves public speaking and she loves to teach so this comes very easy to her.  However, 40 minutes into her talk she can't find the word.  It's gone and not even on the tip of her tongue.  It's gone forever. She thinks that it may be from the champagne she drank or perhaps jet lag.  She feels so embarrassed and wonders what people are thinking.<br /><br />Alice keeps putting off calling her GP thinking that the episodes will disappear with time.  She finally sees her GP and tells her that she's been having memory problems.  Her GP does tests and the tests turn out to be normal.  Alice thinks it is probably a tumor and tells her doctor she wants to see a neurologist.<br /><br />Alice then visits a neurologist who puts her through various memory tests. She fails the tests. The doctor sees that something is very wrong and soon she is diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's and there is very little that can be done.<br /><br />Alice is stunned with the terrible news.  She now has to face her husband and children and tell them the bad news.  Her husband, John has a tough time accepting the news and throws himself into his work. The children have their own opinions on how to deal with their mother.  All three opinions are widely different.  Now Alice has to face up to the loss of a teaching career and her life ahead.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know too much about Alzheimer's, this book will enlighten you.  For those who have gone through this, the disease seen from the perspective of Alice, who is suffering with this treacherous disease, it will enlighten you as well.<br /><br />To those who felt that there should have been an ending and you wanted to know what happened to dear Alice.  The answer is clear.  The disease is Progressive and Degenerative.<br /><br />Dr. Lisa Genova has a Ph.D. in neuroscience and is well versed in this subject, to be sure.  She is brilliant in her depiction of Alzheimer's/Dementia, what it is and how it effects a human being like Alice, as Alice tells her story.<br /><br />Still Alice is a powerful book.  It is heart wrenching yet never depressing.<br /><br />P.S.  My dear mother Ruth suffered with dementia and to me she will always be STILL RUTH as dear Alice will always be STILL Alice to her loved ones.s to face her husband and children and tell them the bad news.

B004EPYZXK|1.0|This is the most terrible, rotten, stupidist movie I have ever seen.  This has replaced my most worst movie on my list.  Using old Apollo films then having the stupid idea of secret Apollo mission which means nothing is not even something a 5th grader would think of.  The worst thing is what I payed for it.  Another bad thing is making it sound like another good movie like Apollo 13.  Apollo 13 was very good and accurate.  Dirty trick to make this sound like another good Apollo movie.  Made me sick.........
B006IW8E0W|5.0|\\"Pina\\" (106 min.) is a thrilling documentary about/celebration of choreographer Pina Bausch's work. It is important to note that Bausch herself was involved in the preparations of this movie, but she passed away just before shooting beagan after a short but devastating bout with cancer. Director Wim Wenders halted the production, but the dancers of the Wuppertal Tanztheatre convinced him to carry on and to make the movie as a tribute to Bausch. And that it certainly is.<br /><br />The movie showcases 4 major pieces by Bausch, starting with The Rite of Spring, in which the dancers perform on a thick layer of dark sand. The other pieces are Cafe Mueller, Kontakthoff, and Vollmond. The latter is truly remarkable: there is a huge rock on the stage, and a continuous waterfall onto the stage, which eventually gets flooded for the most part. The dancers splish and splash their way to, through and onto it and it is an incredible visual experience. A number of scenes are also filmed in and around Wuppertal, including on the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (the \\"hanging monorail\\") as well as a number of industrial sites that are visually very powerful. The documentary includes short interviews with various company dancers on how Pina influenced them. Sadly, the are only snippets of old footage of Pina Bausch herself.<br /><br />I saw this in the theatre in 3D and while the 3D was good, I will say that the 3D aspect is not essential to appreciate this movie for what it is: a love note to modern ballet and to Pina Bausch. If you have any interest in ballet, you truly do not want to miss out on this movie. \\"Pina\\" was nominated for an Oscar for best documentary, and it is easy to see why. Highly, highly recommended!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great game. Yes, they promote their other games in a paid app but who really cares? Lots of people, apparently. Best mahjong!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible app!  And it's FREE!<br /><br />There are lots and lots of Bible versions to choose from.  Once you download a version, it stays on your Kindle Fire, even if the wi-fi is turned off.  For many of the versions, there is also an audiobook version, so you can listen to the text.  And you can sample the different readers to see which one you like best, which is better than buying one and then finding out you don't like the reader.  This is real audiobook listening, not text to speech (which the Fire does not have).  The icons on the right side of the Versions menu will tell whether or not audio is available, and also tell you which text versions you have downloaded onto your Fire.<br /><br />It is easy to switch between versions, and when you do, the new version will appear at the same verse you were reading,  so it is easy to compare versions, although they do not appear side by side.<br /><br />Although I found the reading plans interesting, I do not use them, as they are a bit high maintenance (turning wifi on, logging in, etc).  Nevertheless, this is still a great app.
B000SEGCRS|4.0|I'm just starting out in photography and it's by no means my profession.  I'm just a photo-junkie who finally decided to call it a hobby.  So I figured I might as well get a few books that could teach me how to get the most out of my fancy new digital SLR.  This book was at the top of most \\"top photography book\\" lists that I've found online, as it should be.  It's a really great starter-book and by that, I mean that it's non-technical and beginner-friendly.  This is both a good and a bad thing, but more on that later.  The author does a great job of spreading some light humor throughout the book and, while this was probably designed to make the book seem less intimidating, I found that it actually \\"swung the pendulum too far in the other direction,\\" so to speak.  Yes, I thought his joke about TACK SHARP being an acronym was funny, but now I'm not 100% convinced that I can trust his tip of referring to lenses as \\"glass\\" in photography stores (as in, \\"Don't ask for a new lens.  Say you need some new glass\\").  But that being said, his jokes and non-technical jargon made this very light and I was able to finish it in one sitting.  Now for the cons.  I say this book is \\"non-technical,\\" but that's actually not true.  It's actually at that awkward phase between total beginner and professional photographer.  He'll start name-dropping different terms and settings that you should set your camera to (i.e. aperture, ISO, etc) but never actually explains what they are.  He'll say that ISO is similar to film speed on the old film cameras, but that's about as much detail as you'll get.  So if you're a total, green-horned beginner, don't count on this being the only photography book on your shelf.  The other side of the coin is that by doing this, I'd imagine it would motivate someone to go out and get another book that goes into more detail.  The author does actually say that he hopes this book will inspire his readers to go out and learn more about photography.  So like I said, don't count on this being the only photography book you reference.  This is a really handy guide for beginner and intermediate photographers.  It provides some really great tips on everything from landscape and floral photography to shooting professional weddings and sporting events. And, because it shows you how to take great quality photos, the reader won't become frustrated and give up photography all together.  Keep in mind that this is a really short book, though, and by no means encompasses all there is to know about photography.  For something like that, I'd recommend turning to Complete Digital Photography by Ben Long.  That's a much more in-depth book...well it's really a photography textbook...but that can get you going on the technical side of photography.  In the meantime, I'd highly recommend The Digital Photography Book as a excellent source of information to get you started!

B002RI9XOC|5.0|I began reading this aloud to my kindergartener and though my 10 year old scoffed at the title he was quickly drawn in to the tale.  My pre-teen came in mid-way through the reading and was similarly hooked. She was so taken in that she is going to pick the story up from the beginning.  She does not want me to spoil the surprise of what the children experienced during their first few encounters with the \\"it\\" (I will let you discover what it is when you read this yourself).  My husband came in towards the end of the reading and said afterwards he could tell how much I was enjoying it by my tone of voice.  The phraseology is old-fashioned but not in such a way that my youngest couldn't follow along. There are mixed-gendered children of various ages as the main characters. They squabble at times after getting into various unintended circumstances yet obviously care deeply for one another. I think my children appreciated that aspect as well as the storytelling itself.  This is a delightful book that the whole family will enjoy.

B004EPYZOO|3.0|This is a film that just went for it in most every way. It didn't work completely, but they tried.<br /><br />No doubt an action and effects-fest. The acting...eh. Some of the CGI was weak, but I didn't expect too much going in. I also thought the story was unbelievable, borderline hard to follow. But again I wasn't watching this for story, I rented this for two other reasons. Nicolas Cage and Amber Heard.<br /><br />I'm a HUGE Cage fan, and this is typical of what he's done the past many years now. Quirky, yet action films. He will not convert or lose any fans here. Now Amber Heard, she will be gaining many fans. Sexy is the only word that comes to mind. In this film she's a bit feisty too.<br /><br />It doesn't make my list of classics, but it's definitely entertaining.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun, exciting,  never gets boring. Lots of fun.  I enjoy playing this game immensely.  I never get bored of the many different backgrounds available.
0439023513|1.0|the first two in the series were awesome.  I think she rushed places in the second book but I still really enjoyed it.  This book was just practically off topic and I kept wanting to skip parts.  I think it was rushed and lacked all of the reasons I enjoyed the first two.

B004GTQ4JC|5.0|This is not really a sequel (though some story arcs from the original do get developed here), but a 2-part special that is inspired in part by Cranford, and also two other stories by author Elizabeth Gaskell, i.e. \\"The Moorland Cottage\\", and also \\"The Cage at Cranford\\", see Three Tales of Cranford: Cranford, The Cage at Cranford, and The Moorland Cottage. Besides the familiar and beloved cast of the original Cranford such as Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), etc. several new characters are introduced, such as Lady Glenmire (played by Celia Imrie), and the conjuror Signor Brunoni(Tim Curry).<br /><br />The first part is set in summer 1844 - it has been two years since dear Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench in another luminous portrayal) lost her beloved sister Deborah, and a year since Sophy Hutton married Dr Harrison (these two characters are no longer in this show). Miss Matty seems content with the presence of her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) who is home from India, and helps look after Tilly, the baby of her maid Martha and carpenter Jem Hearne. The continuity from the original Cranford is seen in the railway project which still looms menacingly over the town. Things are also made more exciting with the arrival of Mr. Buxton, a wealthy widower who lives with his ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery) and his son William (Tom Hiddleston who is quite the eye candy). Life in Cranford is always full of surprises and when Lady Ludlow's long absent son Septimus (Rory Kinnear) arrives, things take unexpected turns, precipitated by a tragedy in the family. The old tensions are there - especially between those that are against the railroad project and those ,like Captain Brown and young William who feel that modernization is essential to Cranford's long-term survival. Miss Matty, in her usual subtle fashion, gets involved in some of these village proceedings, with some rather startling results.<br /><br />The second part is set later in the year 1844, October up till Christmas - Miss Matty and her friends are predictably excited at the visit of Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) but when Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn) feels no one amongst her peers is of suitably high rank to meet her, she and Lady Glenmire get snubbed by Matty and company and it is left to Lady Glenmire to set things right in a most memorable way. Matty also faces some challenges that involves a falling out amongst her circle of friends,a serious romance between William and a young woman deemed unsuitable by his father (which has Matty pondering the wisdom of her 'involvement' in bringing the pair together), and more tragedy on the horizon, affecting the citizens of Cranford.<br /><br />A fair note of warning - this particular installment in the Cranford franchise is much more subdued than the original and there's quite a fair bit of tragedy - there's death (involving a couple of familiar characters who were also in the original), grief, tension, family drama, imperiled friendships, the age-old battle between those opposed to change and those who embrace the challenges of modernization, etc., but there's also romance and lighthearted moments. However, I can understand how this particular follow-up might disappoint purists who loved the original and how well it adhered to Gaskell's novel. Personally, I loved the original Cranford and thought it was a superior production, and though I like RTC, the plot is not as engaging as the original. As for the production qualities - they are excellent. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the beauty of the village surroundings as well as the period details, and the score complements the story perfectly.e second part is set later in the year 1844, October up till Christmas - Miss Matty and her friends are predictably excited at the visit of Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) but when Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn) feels no one amongst her peers is of suitably high rank to meet her, she and Lady Glenmire get snubbed by Matty and company and it is left to Lady Glenmire to set things right in a most memorable way.

B006QANR5I|5.0|This DVD is a Region 2 DVD which means it can only be played on a multi-region DVD player. My friend has this DVD (I opted to purchase the DVD set of the entire unedited series of DA Season 2, which includes the Christmas special as it was cheaper).<br /><br />My review concerns the Christmas Special. SPOILER ALERT (If you have not watched Seasons 1 & 2, you might not want to read further as this review contains certain plot developments that are in the earlier DA episodes). This special episode (running about 1 hour and 34 minutes) focuses on the Christmas festivities at Downton in the year 1919, and the ringing in of the New Year 1920. There have been several upheavals among the residents of Downton, both upstairs and downstairs. Poor Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle), Lord Grantham's valet is behind bars, awaiting trial on the charge of murdering his first wife. Head housemaid Anna (Joanne Froggart), who is now married to Bates, remains steadfast and loyal to her husband, hoping that the outcome will be positive. Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), remains supportive of his valet, and engages the services of his family attorney to defend Bates.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) who is engaged to newspaper magnate Sir Richard Carlisle (Iain Glen) finds herself barely tolerating the man, as she realizes what a control freak he is. Things are not made easier with the presence of former beau Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) who is now free, since his fiancee Lavinia Swire died from the Spanish Flu. Matthew has his own set of baggage, overcome by guilt over Lavinia's death, which he thinks is due to his own neglect and coarse treatment of her.<br /><br />The Christmas episode carefully develops some of the other characters in Downton Abbey. Kitchen maid Daisy (Sophie McShera) finally finds her voice and stands up for her rights, and the means by which she does this is credibly portrayed, through the intervention of another, benign person. Footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) has undergone a transformation too, and is not as cocky as he used to be, though he still remains devious.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote has been a go-to app at home and on my phone for a little over a year.  The PC version is atrocious but the MAC version is pretty decent.  Its a bit processor heavy but the updates are tweaking it into place (hopefully).  The Android App has been improving over the releases and as a paid subscriber I've invested a lot of time into making a usable and searchable database for multiple projects from digital to analog projects
B000007ODL|4.0|Love the blues/rock music of J.J. Cale. I am ashamed to admit that this wonderful musician was unknown to me.  He has quickly become a favorite.  This CD has a great selections of his music, sure to get your toes tapping.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I was expecting better writing, especially after the reviews of Isaacson's biography of Benjamin Franklin.  I thought the author would have benefited from more time with a good editor.  At times I was unsure of where we were on a chronological continuum.  At other times the writing was annoyingly repetitive. Yet in the end the book delivered.  Jobs' life story was so compelling I was reluctant to put it down.  I read the Kindle edition on my iPad and have since gifted hardcover copies to a number of family and friends.  T. Knowles  Scottsdale, AZ
B0055S348W|5.0|Works great. The Gmail attachment print feature is very nice. Works on both my Flyer and Droid Incredible with a HP wireless printer.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|so far this app has been challenging and it is great to know u r progressing by collecting the artifacts
B006W0QOF2|5.0|I watched two movies last night. Drive and... I dont even remember. Drive I could not stop thinking about it all night. What a work of art. So stylish to be reminiscent of Tom Fords a Single Man where a clear aesthetic drives the tone of the movie.  The problem is for a lot of people you kinda have to get it. The understanding of \\"cool\\" is not something everyone is blessed with. I mean that hot pink font cheap a** font the credits rolled in on? 70's porn production chic. You just kinda have to get it.  As for the acting it was brilliant because it fit into the aesthetic and tone of the movie perfectly it is what was called for and was delivered in spades.  Movies like these are such gems and rarities because you have to be pretty bold as a director to say: (stereotypical cliche coming up)Sorry Midwest rural republican but I don't need your money at the box office. Im going to make a kick a** film true to a vision.  One final note... the soundtrack was awesome. Every one just threw down to support the final goal.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am enjoying this little game in my spare time. It has many more features than most of the other Mah Jong games I have played on personal compters. Nothing really beats the ole tiles.

B005ZUR724|5.0|so I was on my kindle fire and uninstalled this to clear up some storage space. when I tried to reinstall it I couldn't? anyone have the ame type of problem or know how to fix it?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a fun game that is great for passing time. even has a story line if you play in quest mode.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|There is just something about the solitaire mahjong games. The quiet contimplation of which piece to choose and the graphics if the pieces. This is a great game, you have great graphics and great sound and music. Also G5 always brings you a great gaming experience. You won't regret your purchase.
0307891402|5.0|Very good gamingbook that you can make use for under the whole game.  Helps you find allmost anything you need and is a good thing too have when starting up a new character, so that you can choose the correct race for what to use/be (mage, warrior....).
B001FBSLH2|4.0|This is a must hear concert for Crusaders fans. Just sit back and enjoy the music. Turn the volume up! I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd and like \\"being there\\" experience. The sound was excellent, despite the audio not actually being in 5.1 surround. I couldn't get my system after alot of tweaking and adjusting to send any audio to the center channel. However, I didn't notice this until I actually went over to the center channel. If you can set your receiver to mix in \\"DPL IIx Music\\" mode the sound will be just fine. The mix is still very clean and crisp, Randy Crawford still sounds great. The whole band was \\"tight\\". The price was best at Amazon too.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I really do enjoy playing this game!!! Can be addictive!! U would love this game!!  Real piece of work!!! Have fun playing this game!!_

B0054JZC6E|2.0|The few games I've played so far wouldn't be as bad if the graphics were better. Also,the ideas behind some of them are rediculous. Skewered sushi? Really? Hopefully they get better as you unlock them.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This version of Mahjong is so different that it's hard to put down. I especially like the shuffle feature so you have a chance to finish the pile &amp; go on to the next level. It's especially cool that I got it on the free app day!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I recently re-read this book, and I must say it is just as thrilling and innovative as I remembered it. This is top-notch sci-fi.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My girlfriend and I love this game. We play for hours. It gives us something to do while dinner is cooking, or we are unable to sleep. We just can't stop playing!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's a very useful app. You can download a myriad of translations from many different languages; some have audio versions too. The many devotionals are helpful too.

B0036T32LQ|2.0|The movie was kind of low budget and more like a college film class movie/project than anything. Some disconnects in it where the story didn't make sense. The overall concept was interesting, using greek myth to drive the theme. B movie when you're bored.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Lots of fun for me and my granddaughter....love it.  Good story and fun graphics. Good for hours of fun. Will play for a long time to come.
0061726834|4.0|I had read [[ASIN:0061726818 Before I Fall]] by the author, which I found to be a brave and moving look at the life of a teenage girl and her friends. This, her second book, is also well told and focussed on teenage life and love - but in a very different setting!  We are in the US of a near future, a totalitarian society that literally cuts love out of people. Love is seen to endanger people and at 18, everyone's brain is operated, they are then matched with a partner of opposite gender and spend the rest of the lives in a bleakly bland state of the \\"cure\\". But there are others, there are resisters and the book takes us on the breathless last summer of one girl's discovery of what love and freedom might mean.  The book has weaknesses in how the future society is developed (logical inconsistencies even in the basic premises - i.e. why wouldn't hatred be more dangerous than love?), but it is well-told, fun and exciting. A great YA read you don't want to put down - reminds me of the excitement of reading when younger.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|for me this app is and was a really stupid app it is the free app of the day only reason I got it. really stupid game, match the magic tiles til u get to the magic golden tiles.... yay!!!!! so much fun...... not really but what ever game me something to do after I got through the million and a half ads at the start and the stupid turtorial but maybe I just didn't like the game cuz it not my jam but I guess if u like China stuff or whatever would sooooo not buy
0393338827|5.0|This is a great book.  I have been reading various books on the Financial Crisis and plan to post some reviews of them once I feel I have read most of them. This particular book I am reviewing immediately because it is a little different : it doesn't focus on the \\"big players\\" or the main events. The focus is on a small group of hedge fund managers who saw that the securitization/subprime mortgage market was a disaster waiting to happen long before anyone else.  Very entertaining reading, a great sequel to Liar's Poker and it does provide another worthwhile perspective on what went wrong.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love this version of the game. It would be better without all the ads but it is still fun to play.
B005K17RU0|5.0|does everything it says it will do! before I had the weather channel app, not so impressed this is way more accurate! love!
B00632HWOG|1.0|It started telling me I had an update, but it wouldn't download properly. Now I don't have the app at all and I still cant download even a replacement.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is so fun I play it all day there is no other game to play that is perfect except for this its super fun
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a program that we all know and love. This version does everything right, is smooth and never crashes.  This should be standard on every Kindle Fire.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Fantastic app! Very intuitive &amp; user-friendly. Love that it syncs across all platforms - my laptop, Kindle Fire, Android phone, and even accessible on the web from any computer.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so addictive.it works perfectly fine on kindle fire. I recommend it. you get to dress the little squarrle up.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Let me start right off by saying that \\"The Muppets\\" is a great, big, warm hug of a movie. It's the kind of movie they just don't make anymore. Joyous, uplifting, funny, sweet, touching, entertaining, etc. You can have all your newer cartoons and CGI creations. Give me Kermit and the gang any day of the week. It's been a long time since the gang were in such a major movie, and this is one of the best 'Welcome Back' movies I have ever seen.  Jason Segal (who also co-wrote) the movie stars as Gary, a nice guy with a muppet brother named Walter. Walter is a big fan of the Muppets. When Gary and his girlfriend, Mary (Amy Adams), take a trip to Los Angeles, Walter gets to come along. They tour the now derelict Muppet studios where, Walter learns, an evil oil tycoon (the game Chris Cooper) plans of tearing down the studios. In a last ditch effort, Walter and Gary go to Kermit to try to get the old gang back together again. Kermit agrees and he rounds up the old gang and stages a telethon to save the Muppet studios.  \\"The Muppets\\" is a movie for the kid in everyone. It is certainly a movie that the kids will love, but it's a movie their parents will love. In fact, it may mean more to them than the kids. The Muppets' history goes back decades, and this movie definitely coasts on the nostalgia factor of the old \\"Muppet Show\\" television series. A lot of that storyline, as well as some jokes and cameos, will be only for the adults and over most kids' heads. Don't think that this will divide the audience for the movie. You don't need to know everything. You just need to know how to have fun and be entertained. This movie delivers in spades. There is a lot of referential humor here and, like past movies, is littered with celebrity cameos. Some will be unknown to the kiddies (Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin), but others will be more universal (Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris) and others. But the real draw, of course, are the Muppets. It is a joy to see these characters again in all their glory. The only disappointing thing is that maybe got a shorter end of the stick than others. Still, everyone has their moment, and it's just good to see them again. Human-wise, Segal and Adams are so likeable and game for anything in their roles. You know they just had a blast making this movie. Music-wise, the movie delivers. The new songs are wonderful, there are classic hits, and the famous Muppet song, \\"The Rainbow Connection\\" makes an appearance as well.  \\"The Muppets\\" is a movie that does nostalgia right. It delivers all the watm, fond memories, but also keeps things current(the gang has to deal with how irrelevant the world now sees them as). It touches your heart, tickles your funny bone, and lifts your spirits. There have not been many movies like this in years. \\"The Muppets\\" is a treat. Plain and simple. My favorite movie so far this year.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Game play is pretty good.  Good Majong variant.  I don't know about $5 good. But good.  Ads are only at launch, so that is not a big deal to me.  Autozoom feature is nice.  Wild cards help vs traditional Majong.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Not bad, but please decrease the amount of ads. Great graphics and it's easy to follow. Free app of the day on Kindle Fire.
B0060I0IG2|5.0|Recently, Beethoven symphony recordings have seemingly returned to modern instruments but carrying strong period influences. Chailly uses the standard Peters scores but shows respect for period performance practices used in Beethoven's time. Konwitschny had similar views and practices and was the first to record this way. Chailly seems like a bloodline successor, with the magnificent sound the players provided for Franz all those years ago, but with today's modern sound-capture raising the proverbial bar for sonics that are staggering to listen to. You have not heard (this) Beethoven previously, and Chailly's view is a revelation. While it is usually a \\"trap\\" Chailly adheres to Beethoven's metronome markings. He makes specific note in the booklet notes regarding this, and they only work if the conductor feels these speeds \\"in his blood\\" so to speak, as if they themselves would have also chosen them.<br /><br />And so, we get what a great many are going to call \\"Rushed\\" interpretations. However, I do not agree, and urge you to listen to these recordings yourself and make your own judgment as I have. Under Chailly's direction Symphony #1 is overwhelmingly convincing that he has gotten it right. This is fierce Beethoven, and it is notable; daring; as you have never heard before. It is also totally fulfilling and it is not to be forgotten nor placed \\"beside\\" the previous recordings.<br /><br />The Second displays great power, again the metronome markings, and this approach Fully justifies itself. All three further movements display this forward drive, and one gets the effect that perhaps Beethoven's style was more mature than we usually think at this stage in his life. Again, this is a notable recording and interpretation, and you will not soon forget it, it's nearly infectious.<br /><br />The Third under Chailly leaves NO doubt that Beethoven had reached his first compositional maturity. This is hard driving, furious Beethoven, determined; visionary and impatient...totally convincing even though it is over a minute faster than Mackerras's outing. The March is steady and measured as it should be, with Chailly holding back from the usual quickening in the forceful sections. Again, Fierce Beethoven....magnificent. The finale is rapid but in rich lush sound, nearly twice as fast as most other performances. But, this is impressive, broad, and grand. Certainly the finest reading of this symphony as I have ever heard. Note that!<br /><br />Number 4 is dramatic and full of contrast, sonically brilliant. Beginning with a marvelously hushed intro it moves into a swifter Adagio etc., and once he has built up this tension, Chailly does not allow it to slacken. Beethoven indicated a minimum 84 marking here, and Chailly strictly holds to it. This is grand Beethoven absolutely convincing under the sure hand of Mr. Chailly. Make no mistake about it, this guy has spent time thinking through this body of work, and it is presented with a surety that will leave you convinced.<br /><br />Number 5 also carries a similar level of ferocity, but Chailly holds back some on the weight here and this allows for some unusual clarity of detail. Very Nice. However, his tempo is unrelenting in its drive and this makes for a fabulous transition from his beautiful slow Andante to a shattering end. Repeats are held in check. The finale is impatient, dramatic, swiftly moving forward to it's climax. No nobility here...it is not required. A convincing offering, again, under the conductor's sure direction/thinking.<br /><br />If I have a problem anywhere with this cycle, it is here in the Sixth, swiftly opening and pushing forward. There is an uncomfortableness here for me. I have come to love the languid opening and the joyfulness usually lavished on this work. The second movement is able to sustain the faster tempo and is beautiful here, but it loses some of its effect as the opening movement was taken at such a similar speed. With the drama of the storm, Chailly isagain in his element. Massive chords where required and fierce drums are supplied admirably. The finale is gracious and stately, as the first movement should have perhaps been. I would be interested in hearing other's thoughts regarding this work.<br /><br />With Number 7, Chailly comes relatively close to Kleiber's Vienna Philharmonic recording. Here the main part of the first movement is superb and magnificently pulled off by Chailly's innate thoughts on \\"how things should go here\\". Poised, full of fire, repeat included (unusual). The finale is again fiercely intense, and fully inspired on the part of Chailly. This again is powerful and well thought out, Beethoven.<br /><br />Eight, again, is forward and rapidly moving. But, listen to it, take it in, and I guarantee you will come away believing this is \\"right\\"! Fury; but controlled fury, again here by Chailly makes for a memorable and vivid Eighth that you will come to love.<br /><br />Slower now, in the Ninth, the first tutti with it's forceful attack, gives us a clear and riveting timpani entrance, cleanly and forcefully cutting through the orchestra. Magnificent! Chailly's pace, again, is unrelenting but the rhythm carries strongly and clearly. The recapitulation, dramatic beyond belief comes through as one would expect as Beethoven demanded that the timpani should play fortissimo throughout. Many conductors are timid here....not Chailly! However, Chailly maintains detail here, and the woodwinds are beautifully allowed to display themselves against the timpani. The finale is excellent and full of excitement, the soloists are first rate, particularly the men, richly captured against the players. The coda is lovely high and clear...beautifully captured.<br /><br />The overtures are quite a lovely bonus and are all wonderfully played. Leonore #3 is forceful and quite direct (this is a good thing, of course) and the trumpets are simply marvelous. The Creatures of Prometheus follows in the same vein under Chailly's direction, well formed by the players. The timpani work in the Coriolan is one of those spots that will give you chills....what a luxury to hear details like this! Egmont here stands out because of the piccolo so clearly and cleanly presented at the finale, not often heard so strikingly. King Stephen and Namensfeier are rather unstriking, but no matter, the balance of the set \\"outweighs\\" them!<br /><br />This set will become the new standard-bearer, I am sure. What is striking is that the Gewandhaus was the first place to play a complete cycle of these symphonies in 1825-26 while the Man still was alive. Now, all these years later, Chailly gives us a new cycle of these works with this treasured group, in their magnificent-sounding-hall, the first of the new millennium....how very fitting. Also, it is fortuitous that Chailly be the man in charge here....again fitting, as for my money, he is \\"the best on offer\\" for our time for this music. You will be delighted and totally satisfied with the acquisition of these striking and magnificent interpretations, beautifully presented in their hardbound book carrier in it's protective slipcase. Chailly is to be congratulated for adhering  to the pattern of not altering his tempo once he has set it.<br /><br />This set is absolutely notable and deserves your undivided attention as soon as possible...you will not regret this time well spent with the great master under the visionary eye of Maestro Chailly.<br /><br />Life is short, folks, enjoy these without delay!<br /><br />~operabruince drums are supplied admirably.

Fury; but controlled fury, again here by Chailly makes for a memorable and vivid Eighth that you will come to love.<br /><br />Slower now, in the Ninth, the first tutti with it's forceful attack, gives us a clear and riveting timpani entrance, cleanly and forcefully cutting through the orchestra. Magnificent! Chailly's pace, again, is unrelenting but the rhythm carries strongly and clearly. The recapitulation, dramatic beyond belief comes through as one would expect as Beethoven demanded that the timpani should play fortissimo throughout. Many conductors are timid here....not Chailly! However, Chailly maintains detail here, and the woodwinds are beautifully allowed to display themselves against the timpani. The finale is excellent and full of excitement, the soloists are first rate, particularly the men, richly captured against the players. The coda is lovely high and clear...beautifully captured.<br /><br />The overtures are quite a lovely bonus and are all wonderfully played. Leonore #3 is forceful and quite direct (this is a good thing, of course) and the trumpets are simply marvelous. The Creatures of Prometheus follows in the same vein under Chailly's direction, well formed by the players. The timpani work in the Coriolan is one of those spots that will give you chills....what a luxury to hear details like this! Egmont here stands out because of the piccolo so clearly and cleanly presented at the finale, not often heard so strikingly. King Stephen and Namensfeier are rather unstriking, but no matter, the balance of the set \\"outweighs\\" them!<br /><br />This set will become the new standard-bearer, I am sure. What is striking is that the Gewandhaus was the first place to play a complete cycle of these symphonies in 1825-26 while the Man still was alive. Now, all these years later, Chailly gives us a new cycle of these works with this treasured group, in their magnificent-sounding-hall, the first of the new millennium....how very fitting. Also, it is fortuitous that Chailly be the man in charge here....again fitting, as for my money, he is \\"the best on offer\\" for our time for this music. You will be delighted and totally satisfied with the acquisition of these striking and magnificent interpretations, beautifully presented in their hardbound book carrier in it's protective slipcase. Chailly is to be congratulated for adhering  to the pattern of not altering his tempo once he has set it.<br /><br />This set is absolutely notable and deserves your undivided attention as soon as possible...you will not regret this time well spent with the great master under the visionary eye of Maestro Chailly.<br /><br />Life is short, folks, enjoy these without delay!<br /><br />~operabruinms are supplied admirably. The finale is gracious and stately, as the first movement should have perhaps been. I would be interested in hearing other's thoughts regarding this work.  With Number 7, Chailly comes relatively close to Kleiber's Vienna Philharmonic recording. Here the main part of the first movement is superb and magnificently pulled off by Chailly's innate thoughts on \\"how things should go here\\". Poised, full of fire, repeat included (unusual). The finale is again fiercely intense, and fully inspired on the part of Chailly. This again is powerful and well thought out, Beethoven.  Eight, again, is forward and rapidly moving.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great.  Love the landscape layout.  I,ll be spending a lot of time with this. Can,t wait to try all the versions.
B0014E9188|4.0|From strictly a live DVD rating and musical enjoyment perspective, I'd rate this DVD a 4 to a 4.5. Strong 4.5 if there weren't any distracting effects added in post. I prefer a straight forward video recording of the event without effects because it is more true to life. In terms of faithfulness to the CD versions of the songs, I'd rate this DVD closer to 3 or 3.5.<br /><br />First, I realize that the songs are not mine, and that Porcupine Tree has every right to change sounds, omit ambient effects and other parts of songs and to change lyrics for live performances.<br /><br />Second, I own all of the available Porcupine Tree albums available thus far. I like all of them, some more than others. I also own both the Arriving Somewhere and Anesthetize DVD's. I have to say I prefer Anesthetize to Arriving simply because the songs are closer to what I'm used to hearing on the albums. I'm not faulting the musicianship on this DVD, which is excellent as usual, but the lack of specific song elements which were deliberately put in place in the studio for the CD's but omitted during the live performance. Many of these were keyboard driven, which could have been reproduced via samples during the show, so it isn't about not enough musicians to accomplish the task in case that was the thought that came to mind.<br /><br />For me, there are too many key elements present on the CD versions which are missing on the Arriving Somewhere DVD versions of the songs. Perhaps it's the way I listen to songs, but to me, not hearing specific ambient sounds and/or chords detracts from the overall experience. Some of the biggest offenders that come to mind are as follows:<br /><br />The very beginning of Even Less where the girl laughing (as heard on the CD) is missing from the live version. The lyrics are actually changed on Even Less from \\"You're a  martyr for even less\\" to \\"I'm a martyr to even less\\".<br /><br />On Trains there are some distinct changes to the acoustic guitar parts, specifically with the phrases that are reminiscent of Spanish music with hand claps and timing. The claps are there on the DVD via audience participation, but the picking of notes on the CD is replaced with strumming on Steven's part. Perhaps this is due to the line-up changes the band has seen?(This particular piece is what got my brother-in-law to start listening to PT, the Spanish-sounding part specifically as he really liked the way the changed styles mid-song.) The overall timing is pretty fast compared to the CD version, which is different, not bad.<br /><br />I'll stop here with this: The music is good, and the band performs well, but for individuals who listen to CD's and enjoy specific keyboard parts or drum riffs or dissonant guitar chords, etc you may be finding yourself wishing some song components weren't omitted when viewing this DVD.<br /><br />If you don't expect specific elements in a song this DVD will not disappoint. It's a great live performance, it's simply different!
0307749495|4.0|Good read.  Takes the reader back to the days as an MP.  All his friends are in this book.  Interesting beginning to the folding toothbrush.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|its a good game. only played a little so far. has nice options in the game. theme has changed once as I  progressed through the game. I'm still playing the game right now. just stopped to review it. it has three play modes but I have only been paying one mode so far. at the start up it has an ad for the developers other games, but that is easy to ignore.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Takes my mind off things to do meaningless matching. Also keeps me busy when I find myself in waiting situations!
B006UG90RM|3.0|As a 44 yr old, I was around for the first 6 DLR fronted VH albums. I first saw them live on WACF tour back in 1980. I absolutely LOVED the first 4 records, Diver Down had its moments as did 1984, but not like the first 4. The thing to me that distinguished VH from most other bands of the day in the hard rock genre were Eddies \\"brown\\" sound, along with the way Daves vocals fit in with that. I thought Eddies sound started to change with 1984, and then all through the Sammy era, his guitar sound to my ears anyway, didn't have the impact that it once did. With the release of a \\"Different Kind of Truth\\" It seems Eddie has found that sound once again! Dave's voice though not able to hit the higher registers of his youth, is serviceable enough, but more importantly, the \\"vibe\\" is back to some degree. It does lack the power of Michael Anthony's backing vocals, but Wolfie is Mike's equal, if not maybe a bit better on the 4 string. I admit that my hopes for this record were dashed a bit when I heard \\"Tatoo\\" I simply didnt like it at all. It sounded like a big attempt at radio that, to my ears missed badly. But then as more tracks were posted on the website, my enthusiasm rose.  Its been reported that some of the riffs and tracks were leftovers from back in the day, and, I think some of them do sound more like early VH. I bet most diehard VH fans can pick out the older stuff, but, so what? THey may be older riffs, but, I feel sure they have been tweaked and added to during the recording process.  There are some GREAT barnburner total rock anthems on this album. Standout cuts are, As Is, Outta Space, China Town, the trouble with never, bullethead, and Big River. Those are the best and hardest tracks imo. Other strong cuts are Beats Workin' ,Blood and Fire, and You and your blues. Bringin up the rear are Tattoo, Stay Frosty, Honeybaby, and, shes the woman.  I gave the record 3 stars, which may to some indicate middle of the road, which is why I hate the 5 star system. Its a MUCH better record than middle of the road, but, I rate pretty harshly and, I have only heard a handful of 5 star albums in my life. I prefer the \\"out of 100 rating system\\" as it gives you more room to accurately rate a record so, I give it a 85 out of 100. As a long suffering VH fan, its a worthy addition to the classic VH albums. I like it better than Diver Down or 1984, but it doesnt measure up to what I consider their 2 best which are Fair Warning and Women and Children first. VH2 just a hair behind those 2, with VH1 being a great debut, but 4th, then the new one. If you like great American hard rock, with great guitars, drums, bass, and a fun frontman, go get the \\"Truth\\" from the so cal bad boys!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|wow this is the best mahjong ive tried on any platform!  i would pay for it for sure,  makes an old game fun again
B005ZUR724|3.0|this game is highly addictive and a great play... until you try to join a guild, or open one of the many scattered chests, in which case the app force closes. if they fix this the game would receive 5 stars, until such a time the rating just keeps going down.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I liked this game. It was fun, easy, and a fun game to have that doesn't have a big story line or a lot of levels. I can play it when standing in line waiting or hanging out.
B0012909NQ|5.0|I bought this and Live at Wembley and found that Rome was such a far greater production showing Genesis at their musical BEST! Wembley was great for it's time but comparing the two it was like comparing the stone age to modern day. Rome brought the music alive with it's video, lights and stage show. And the band NEVER sounded better! The 70's stuff which is my personal favorite was done to perfection. The added DVD on how it all came together (Come Rain or Shine) was a wonderful look at how they created this tremendous show. In the Cage, Cinema Show, Afterglow, Firth of Fifth, I Know What I Like, Ripples wow! And make sure you watch the extra they threw in when they did Ripples in their hotel room with only acoustic guitars and Phil singing! Also the drum solo Phil and Chester did on a furniture cushion! Dang! Then there is the ultimate for me at least Los Endos. It showed how tight the band and music is even these so many years later. The DVD is like seeing Seconds Out live! Wish they would have done Suppers Ready! They also have to come out with a Blueray edition. Thanks Tony, Phil, Mike, Daryl and Chester for helping me to see again why I fell in love with Genesis back in the 70's!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Dialogue is a little goofy but the game is still fun.  Works great on my Thrive 10&quot;.  I have nothing more to say so let me submit this stupid review.
B0050BPIB0|5.0|The pretty young guy has converted the music in beauty, fisically beauty!<br />The lyrics, the voice, the image, his eyes... OMG!<br />Songs like 'Perdoname' or 'Solamente Tu' show us this, he is the future of music from Spain!!!
1594203059|5.0|A wonderful book you should add to your reading pile. Ferguson is a Scots historian now at Harvard. This is a terrifically researched exploration of why a few petty squabbling states in Europe, against all odds, came to dominate the world. The author has a great ability to pull the illuminating fact or pertinent quote from the morass of history. He also explores why South America, which was by far the richer set of colonies, is now far poorer than North America. (Hint: widespread property ownership and property rights.) Fergusson says Western Civilization had six \\"killer apps\\" that led them to dominate the world: competition, science, property rights, medicine, the consumer society and the work ethic. He makes a solid case that these six factors not only led to western dominance, but the high standard of living in western society, pursued today by the rest of the world.<br /><br />Some of the bits were worth the price of the book. Martin Luther's defense of publishing the Koran in order that Christians could see \\"how entirely cursed, abominable and desperate a book it is.\\" John Locke's attempt to ban lawyers in Carolina. The author proclaiming the US Constitution \\"the most impressive piece of political institution building in all of history.\\" His note that Tocqueville identified the essential difference between the American and French revolutions, a preference for liberty in ours and equality in theirs (a warning to us today). His insight that the threat to the west comes not from radical Islam, \\"but from our own lack of understanding of, and faith in, our own cultural heritage.\\" He points out that Asians now work far more hours than Americans, and we more than Europeans.<br /><br />That the Chinese Communists party had a report \\"specifying three requirements for sustainable economic growth: property rights as a foundation, the law as a safeguard and morality as a support\\" is telling. And Ferguson's comment that, \\"mass immigration is not necessarily the solvent of a civilization, if the migrants embrace, and are encouraged to embrace, the values of the civilization to which they are moving\\" should inform our immigration debate.<br /><br />And this: \\"\\"It is important to remember that most cases of civilizational collapse are associated with fiscal crisis as well as wars. All of the examples discussed above were preceded by sharp imbalances between revenues and expenditures, as well as by difficulties with financing public debt.\\" Are you listening, Washington? (No, alas.)<br /><br />Ferguson asks if we can maintain western civilization and western dominance. That's an open question. I read the hard copy, but my wife listened to it on disk in the car. Ferguson reads the book himself, but adds in wonderful accents on the quotes. Do yourself a favor and read this book.<br /><br />Robert A.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great version. I really like the smooth animation and game play. It's a load of fun. Has a story line if you like or you can jump to endless game play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best real life game to me cause u can buy games and earn than get a high score so would recomend u buy this app
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game does a good job of introducing new mechanics quickly through each level. Similar games get stale pretty fast, but this one stays fresh with unlockable modes and a sleek design.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I find this game a bit addicting and have ahad a good time playing. No problems so far, except for not wanting to put it down.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is probably the best intro to a mahjong game I've ever played. I'm not sure why others are complaining about ads in the paid version, but I can't fault the dev for wanting to promote it's other products. The opening page ad wasn't intrusive, and it allowed me to continue past it without being forced to wait. Good job.
6305041156|5.0|What a totally terrific movie this is. Kurosawa set the bar very high for all Samurai movies that follow. At some time I will buy the Criterion version of it. If there were more stars available than 5 this movie would get them.

0684857219|4.0|This has enormous amounts of information about anything one would want to know about bodybuilding. The pictures in the book are very inspiring and helpful.  This is also updated from the previous edition of Arnold's Encyclopedia. Only one glitch is that the hall of fame in this book are printed in black and white. But that should not deter anyone from buying this book.  The training programs as some people say cause over training and tiredness. But then you have to realize the fact the that the book is an encyclopedia and its for serious bodybuilders. You start with the beginners schedule and then move on to the advanced. It its too tiring you can reduce the number of sets or even skip a few exercises and interchange exercises between 2 same body part workouts in alternative sessions.  You can find any information you would want to know about exercises and bodybuilding routine in this book. It's a good keepsake for anyone interested in bodybuilding. If you are done reading the book from back to back, you can still flip through the pages and get inspired by the pictures in the book and hit the gym with more intensity.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|nothing like not being able to play a game without &agrave;s and spam.  at least the games are addicting.  yay
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is a great game. I just bought it yesterday and it has the toolbox level and honey box also so it is fully updated.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love it so far I haven't even had any adds. I have played several levels now I am very happy wiith it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read the first few chapters free through Amazon. I was in the process of blowing through a few smaller books and short stories to clear them off my Kindle and I was disappointed that none of them captivated me half as much as the first two chapters that I had sampled on here for free so I snatched up the whole trilogy at once and was glad I did.  Took me less than a week to read all three and while I wouldn't classify it as the best thing I've ever read, it certainly pulled me in and made me feel the fear and hurt and few moments of contentment along with the protagonist.  And sometimes that's all a series needs to do. I highly recommend this to literary adventure lovers everywhere. Collins' writing is a bit formulaic...and the formula works. Most chapters end with a twist of some type and I found my jaw dropping at more than one of them.  I've heard some criticisms that all the loose ends weren't tied up. For me, ending the series with some of the ambiguity that it began with was fitting. Despite having many other books in my queue, this one begs for an immediate re-read. Four and a half stars rounded up.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is solo awesome. i love it even if you don't like the feint you can remove your account by going into settings and clicking remove account. awesome game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A very simple version but with enough features to keep it playable for all player skill levels. The setup screen allows you to make it as rigid or forgiving as you like. With all the game aps I have I still return to this as a great time killer often.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so cool 20 more games then you paid for I love this game it is super cool and fun.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's  a good game, but too many apps. I mean everytime I finish a game theres like three app popping up.BEWARE you've been warned.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|virus database is too old? what does that even mean? did this happen to anybody else? I clicked resolve all problems and it asked if I wanted to ignore 134 problems. NOT LIKELY! (kindle fire)

B003TML0VO|3.0|Carlos Santana and his searing guitar lines have been a big part of my life since high school, when a friend turned me on to the first and second LPs from the original incarnation of the Santana Band.  Over the years he's gone various places, from the Indian guru-influenced music of Devadip Carlos Santana trading licks with Mahavishnu John McLaughlin, to the jazz-influenced Borboletta and Welcome (still my two favorite Santana CDs--Tom Coster and the late Richard Kermode on keys were a big part of that sound), back to a renewed encounter with his Roman Catholic roots in Sacred Fire, and then the monster accomplishment that was Supernatural.<br />Here, Carlos and the latest version of his band cover some rock hits from the 60s all the way to the 90s.  And they're covers of tunes that have been covered many times before. I was curious to hear how an iconic musician like Carlos Santana would handle them.<br />My interest was more than that of a casual listener to rock music.  I've played keyboards in various bands since the mid-1960s, and have covered nearly all these tunes myself at one time or another.  I've also covered many Santana songs.  So I have a semi-professional interest in this CD; I give it a qualified endorsement.<br />What does Carlos bring to the table?  Well, mostly his trademark searing guitar lines on top of--and all over--updated versions of these songs, along with some catchy Latin percussion on a few of them.  He (or his producers) have a different vocalist on each tune, and that vocalist has to be strong enough to make an impression when pitted against the Santana guitar.  I'm out of touch with current rock music, and other than Chris Cornell--late of Audioslave--and the great Joe Cocker, I really know nothing about the singers.  But each of them acquits him- or herself well, with the exception of rapper NAS.  And his problem is simply that I abhor rap--I don't listen to it, and therefore I'm totally unqualified to pass judgment on his performance of \\"Back in Black.\\"  But more about that later.<br />The formula works well, contrary to what many of the reviewers say.  The big surprise for me was \\"Little Wing,\\" a bittersweet Hendrix tune.  The inimitable Joe Cocker covers this so well--his whiskey-soaked vocals are a perfect choice.  For my ears, this one song alone was worth the price of the CD.  I've never heard a better cover of this classic Hendrix tune.<br />Chris Cornell, who I think has the best set of pipes in rock music at the moment, handles Led Zeppelin's classic \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" just fine--he gives it a different treatment than did Zep's Robert Plant (a vocalist who in his prime was the greatest that rock has produced--sorry Ian Gillian!), and the bridge is less psychedelic than was the Zep original, but it all works.  The same is true of the Rolling Stone's \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking.\\"<br />Cream's \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" was a pleasant surprise.  Rob Thomas does a fine job on the vocals, and the addition of keys and Latin percussion make this an outstanding cover of the classic.  The typical Santana screaming guitar solo works just fine--it's not Eric Clapton; it's Carlos Santana.  And that's more than OK.<br />Unlike some of the reviewers, I was disappointed by the rendition of George Harrison's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"  And what disappointed me was the guitar.  The cut begins with a bittersweet cello introduction from the great Yo-Yo Ma (a master stroke, that!) coupled with a classical/flamenco guitar sound that would have been great all the way through.  But too soon, we lose this and get instead Santana's trademark sound all over--the guitar doesn't gently weep, it screams and rants.  Ultimately, this detracts AND distracts from India.Arie's quiet, evocative vocals.<br />I particularly liked the cover of Deep Purple's chestnut, \\"Smoke on the Water.\\"  I don't know how many of Purple's live CDs I have where the band does this tune to end its live set, and some of them feature Ian Gillian after his voice--sadly--has gone downhill and he just can't cut it.  Jacoby Shaddix (otherwise unknown to me--maybe somebody out there knows something about him) handles the vocals as well as Gillian did in his prime, and Santana's guitar would embarrass Ritchie Blackmore if he heard it.<br />T. Rex's \\"Bang A Gong,\\" one of the first glam rock hits, is handled well.  It's a fun tune, and the Santana Band, along with vocalist Gavin Rossdale, maintain the fun with a Latin beat bubbling in the background.<br />The other tunes are competent, with TWO glaring exceptions.  Thankfully they're adjacent to each other on the CD, so when you come to them, you simply fast forward from cut 5 (\\"Photograph\\") to cut 8 (\\"Smoke on the Water\\"), without having to endure two awful covers:  I refer to AC/DC's \\"Back in Black,\\" here performed with rapper NAS, and the Doors' classic tune, \\"Riders on the Storm.\\"  They are SO bad that I feel I have to vent:<br />I never cared much for AC/DC; I didn't like the screechy vocalist in the band, whose voice reminds me of somebody grating fingernails on a chalkboard.  But surely, having the lyric rapped out is no improvement.  So it's a conjunction of two musical phenomena that I can't stand; the aforesaid AC/DC, and rap.  Taken together, they are awful.  Utterly forgettable.  Your life will be better if you don't ever listen to it.<br />But things get worse!  The awfulness reaches a new level with \\"Riders on the Storm.\\"  As I mentioned, I'm a keyboard player--I've done \\"Riders\\" in every rock band I've played in from 1972 forward, I know it backwards and forwards, and love it like an old friend, even though Jim Morrison's lyrics were suitably creepy, particularly part about the \\"killer on the road/whose brain is squirming like a toad.\\"  The great Ray Manzarek in featured on keys on this cut, but somehow that doesn't save it.  Rather than playing his Fender Rhodes electric piano, he plays some of the riffs on what sounds like a screeching Farfisa or Vox organ.  It doesn't work; you can't take riffs written for the crystalline sound of the Fender Rhodes and paste them on a Farfisa!  But what is worse--sacrilege even--is how Carlos handles the guitar part.  Robbie Krieger, the Doors' guitarist, was a master of understatement and restraint.  His solo on \\"Riders,\\" and his background work when Manzarek takes his justifiably famous Rhodes solo (omitted on this cover), are masterpieces of impressionism, spare, lean, and definitely what this song wants and needs.  But Carlos doesn't understand this--his guitar is all over, like a headstrong bull in a china shop full of delicate, finely cut pieces.  The result is atrocious, something I will never listen to again as long as I live.  This song alone takes the album from 5 stars to 3 stars.  I can't imagine what the producer and arranger Howard Benson was thinking!  It's awful, plain damn awful!<br />But those two abominations aside, this is a good album--not a masterpiece like Welcome or Supernatural, but more or less respectful of the artists whose work Santana and his bandmates choose to cover.  Special kudos should go to drummer Dennis Chambers.  His drums are mixed front and center, and they add to the drive and pulse of this music.  He's the glue that holds it all together.<br />So, 3 stars.  I wanted to give it more, but there's just enough awfulness to drag the rating down.  You won't miss anything special if you pass this album by, but if like me you grew up listening to a lot of this music and want to hear a fresh take on it, you may well enjoy Guitar Heaven.  Just skip cuts 6 and 7--You have been warned!gone downhill and he just can't cut it.  Jacoby Shaddix (otherwise unknown to me--maybe somebody out there knows something about him) handles the vocals as well as Gillian did in his prime, and Santana's guitar would embarrass Ritchie Blackmore if he heard it.  T. Rex's \\"Bang A Gong,\\" one of the first glam rock hits, is handled well.  It's a fun tune, and the Santana Band, along with vocalist Gavin Rossdale, maintain the fun with a Latin beat bubbling in the background.  The other tunes are competent, with TWO glaring exceptions.  Thankfully they're adjacent to each other on the CD, so when you come to them, you simply fast forward from cut 5 (\\"Photograph\\") to cut 8 (\\"Smoke on the Water\\"), without having to endure two awful covers:  I refer to AC/DC's \\"Back in Black,\\" here performed with rapper NAS, and the Doors' classic tune, \\"Riders on the Storm.\\"  They are SO bad that I feel I have to vent:  I never cared much for AC/DC; I didn't like the screechy vocalist in the band, whose voice reminds me of somebody grating fingernails on a chalkboard.  But surely, having the lyric rapped out is no improvement.  So it's a conjunction of two musical phenomena that I can't stand; the aforesaid AC/DC, and rap.  Taken together, they are awful.  Utterly forgettable.  Your life will be better if you don't ever listen to it.  But things get worse!  The awfulness reaches a new level with \\"Riders on the Storm.\\"  As I mentioned, I'm a keyboard player--I've done \\"Riders\\" in every rock band I've played in from 1972 forward, I know it backwards and forwards, and love it like an old friend, even though Jim Morrison's lyrics were suitably creepy, particularly part about the \\"killer on the road/whose brain is squirming like a toad.\\"  The great Ray Manzarek in featured on keys on this cut, but somehow that doesn't save it.  Rather than playing his Fender Rhodes electric piano, he plays some of the riffs on what sounds like a screeching Farfisa or Vox organ.  It doesn't work; you can't takeriffs written for the crystalline sound of the Fender Rhodes and paste them on a Farfisa!  But what is worse--sacrilege even--is how Carlos handles the guitar part.  Robbie Krieger, the Doors' guitarist, was a master of understatement and restraint.  His solo on \\"Riders,\\" and his background work when Manzarek takes his justifiably famous Rhodes solo (omitted on this cover), are masterpieces of impressionism, spare, lean, and definitely what this song wants and needs.  But Carlos doesn't understand this--his guitar is all over, like a headstrong bull in a china shop full of delicate, finely cut pieces.  The result is atrocious, something I will never listen to again as long as I live.  This song alone takes the album from 5 stars to 3 stars.

B00003CXBH|5.0|The top couple 5 star reviews by \\"Dave\\" followed by \\"A Customer\\" describe this movie quite accurately. I can only add my impressions of the tale, here those are:<br /><br />This magnificent cinematographic (ART of motion-picture photography), devastating, yet simultaneously deeply touching story, is so spectacular no words can minimize, much less \\"ruin\\" the movie experience (despite a couple of readers' spoiler rants). Having one's humane soul challenged, while artistic being is awed with panoramic views, visions and life lived in nature itself. This movie dares to actually \\"live\\" a bygone historical adventure, and throws in an added bouquet, a fantastic musical score! Do yourself a huge favor, do not miss this experience, if you have the courage that is. You will be tested!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003CXBH The Mission (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]

B000000W5P|5.0|Even in the couple years seperating this from it's predecessor [[ASIN:B000000W5D Black & Blue]] the pop music world had become more and more fashion obessed. The Stones had seen this coming in the 60's and it was often the topics of their most snide \\"diss\\" songs on pop culture. The cut n paste wig ad cover art of this album with reddened eyes does sort of have an anti authoritarian punk attitude about it. But somehow or other the band managed to put together what many people feel is one of their strongest and most successful albums of the 70's decade. In a lot of ways it doesn't do much different from the previous release. If anything it does make everything quite a bit stronger at the base anyway.<br /><br />  The throbbing,bassy dance/funk groove of \\"Miss You\\" gets the ball rolling fast. If this was the Stones \\"going disco\\",they certainly didn't gloss anything up. It's every bit as gritty and garagey as anything they do. Only instrumentally slicker maybe. On the other hand on \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\",a re-imagintion of the Temptations on \\"Imagination\\",the title song,\\"Lies\\",\\"Far Away Eyes\\" and \\"Respectable\\" they are churning out one powerful Stones style soul rocker after another and with vigor to spare. Keith again supplies his wavering/weakened singing to his own \\"Before They Make Me Run\\",guiltlessly bragging on his wild way of life without apology. On \\"Beast Of Burden\\"? Well it's slow grinding Hi rhythm section/Al Green soul/funk all the way. With one of the best written hooks here.<br /><br />  On \\"Shattered\\",with some of it's harsh keyboard sounds the jumpy rhythms has a slight punk/new wave atmosphere. This in a way would serve as the 70's answer to 'Let It Bleed';closing out one decade,with the possibility of it being their final release but actually ushering in a new era for them. While I doubt anything seriously expected this to be the final release for the Rolling Stones,the energy level they put out with the release did make it seem as if something might've been coming to and end. It wasn't. Personally the 70's wasn't exactly the easiest decade on them. The decade to follow even less so. But at least at this point it was really doing a lot to fuel their creative juices. And I saw all the better for the rest of us.and end. It wasn't. Personally the 70's wasn't exactly the easiest decade on them. The decade to follow even less so.

B000003BF1|5.0|Over the decades The Rolling Stones have been musical survivors.  And now they had to survive that death of founding member (and for all intents and purposes the groups original leader) Brian Jones. A lot of bands of the 60's generation,even the Fab Four themselves were breaking up or about to around this time. And this,in a way could've been the end of the Rolling Stones. That is,if Mick Taylor hadn't been bought in perhaps. Not only did he of course bring his own instrumental flavors to the band. But the Stones,resilliant as always found a new way to play the rock n soul they made famous over the years. And it was clear with this album the Stones were'nt going to end here and now. In fact there seemed a good chance they'd continue to evolve even from here.<br /><br />  The opener \\"Gimme Shelter\\" says it all. It has a somewhat more forboding type soul air than aggresive rock n roll. And on \\"Live With Me\\" and the title song are going in exactly the same direction. These are among the strongest numbers here. There are many. But they are definitely not what one might expect. An interpretation of Robert Johnson's \\"Love In Vain\\",\\"Country Honk\\" (an early take on what would become \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" of course) and \\"Midnight Rambler\\" all showcase a more eerily subdued country-blues flavor than anything I've heard the Stones do before this. Now a lot of bands from the Byrds onward were experimenting with country music in the late 60's. It's not surprising then that,when the Stones came out to do this it was done via the blues. On \\"You Got The Silver\\",the far less confident voiced Keith Richards takes on an almost Bob Dylan-like lead vocal before Mick is back in action on the drug drenched funky process of \\"Monkey Man\\"<br /><br />  At the end of course is \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\". The hook is often seen as represented the double edged sword of the countercultural experience. Musically though it's an epic gospel/soul type number featuring choral vocals from Doris Troy and the London Bach Choir. Sort of their answer to the Beatles \\"The End\\" maybe,with a bit of witty resignation.  If this album had in fact been the last the Rolling Stones ever made,it would've easily been a big finish masterpiece for them. Something they could go out being proud of. And it was sort of an end. The end of the Abkco anyway. Following a live album the next year the band would hereafter move on with their own label/self production and basically give their already steady momentum yet another jumpstart. As it stands though this album is about the best possible way for them to close out the 60's and is one of their most thoroughly rich and varied releases.Bach Choir.

B000000W5N|5.0|The 1970's had began and the Rolling Stones were back. On their formal follow up to [[ASIN:B000003BF1 Let It Bleed]] the same lineup is very much intact.And so they are musically as well. The famous interactive \\"zipper\\" cover (only included on certain import editions of this CD) was designed by Andy Warhol. And when one puts the record itself on...well it's clear from the first seconds that Stones admirers are not going to be disappointed. They don't spend a lot of time doing anything shocking here. Just basically keeping the pace and giving people everything they had both on stage of course and here in the studio. It's more than worth the time to take the trip with them.<br /><br />  \\"Brown Sugar\\" opens up the album with another hit rocker,full of soul and a nasty groove as only they could quite deliver it. \\"Sway\\",the very memorable \\"Wild Horses\\" and the witty \\"Dead Flowers\\" are all somewhat more subdued pieces,kind of in the country-rock vein of the previous album only a bit more instrumentally formed. \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" is a seven+ minute amped up funk number that extends into an almost fusion style jamming at the end,perhaps reflecting Charlie Watt's love of jazz. \\"You Gotta Move\\",\\"I Got The Blues\\" and \\"Sister Morphine\\" take on the blues yet again. And this time there's the feeling the band might be having them more than shaking them off with their tales of drugs and depressions.<br /><br />  Aside from another grooving soul rocker in \\"Bitch\\" there's \\"Moonlight Mile\\",another country type closer with a lot of steel guitar. I still find it kind of interesting how the Rolling Stones seemed to be flirting so heavily with country music along with blues,soul and funk on their late 60's/early 70's albums. In a way I always wondered if it was a mildly careerist mood. Mick and Keith especially do have that side of their personality. Less cynically there is also the possibility that they were simply looking to branch out,finding other things within the blues than the blues itself. And in both these cases they made it work wonderfully. The future would offer a lot more than some might not have expected. But in the end,they were what they were. And they did what they did extremely well.And in both these cases they made it work wonderfully. The future would offer a lot more than some might not have expected.

0385342063|3.0|I really enjoyed the Shopaholic series by Sophie Kinsella, so much so that I preordered this book! When I first picked up the book and Kinsella started to introduce me to Poppy Wyatt, the main character, I felt like it was a shadow of Becky Bloomwood. Poppy is funny, carefree, and assuming in what she thinks she knows about her fellow characters. In reality she's nosy, kind of shallow and not as likeable. In addition, I HATED the footnote thing!! Maybe it was because it was on my kindle, but I HATED having to click on each stupid footnote for it to say something like \\"yeah, I did\\" and then click back to where I was reading. I think I would have hated it in print too but cannot say for sure. I didnt enjoy this book as much, I think Sophie Kinsella has done much better.

0307592731|4.0|I've spent a lot of daylight hours (no overnights) on the Pacific Crest Trail, and I'm always fascinated when I cross paths with a \\"through hiker\\".  These amazing folks trek for months, some of them from Mexico to Canada, never straying far from the trail.  So I was immediately attracted to this book, wanting to know more about this experience.  Truthfully, I was a little disappointed once I saw that it was just as much about a personal, internal journey as it was about the literal journey.  But I wasn't disappointed for long.  Cheryl Strayed is a gifted writer, and I was involved in her story immediately.  She decided to solo-hike a large portion of the PCT almost on a whim, and is miserably unprepared for the reality of the undertaking.  The book intersperses physical trail challenges (injuries, wild animals, scary terrain crossings, etc) with self-reflection on her messed-up life to that point.  When she describes her experiences on the PCT, she doesn't spend a lot of time describing the beauty all around her.  Instead, it is about the emotions she experienced on the trail, how the trail affected her, and how the distance from her \\"real life\\" gave her the courage to grow up.  And it's very powerful stuff.

B00007AJF8|4.0|Alternating between quirky, drab, conceptual and surreal, this fantasy what-if doesn't even march to the beat of any drummer in the classical sense. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are unrecognizably pedestrian as a mismatched husband and wife at the end of their rope, both after the same thing in spite of one another. Their marriage, and the factors that lead to its quick, sad disintegration, may be the traditional center of the story, but along the way the plot jolts in so many wildly different directions that it's actually rendered secondary. Like a journey through the mind of a creative genius with serious ADD, it samples a dozen concepts strong enough to power their own film, then still finds a way to somehow marry them all into a single adventurous, mostly coherent, finale. Unclassifiable in the very best way, it's not something I could watch more than once every four or five years.

B001EBWITA|3.0|As an on-again, off-again follower of the Vertigo comic this is based upon, I was all geared up to hate it mightily before it had even spun up in the DVD player. With that said, it fares somewhat better than I'd expected. It isn't a raging success story, but it's not a tragic insult to the rich, lengthy source material either. Keanu Reeves is a horrible choice for the lead, no doubt about that - where the funny book Constantine is a complex, witty, bitter but charismatic subculture hero, Keanu's interpretation is as nuanced as a bag of bricks. I don't know how much I can fault the actor for that - after all, he's been playing dress-up with the same character for two decades now - but regardless of where the blame lies, he lacks the unspoken authenticity that role needs to get off the ground. Fortunately, the blow is softened somewhat by a dynamite intro sequence that may as well have been ripped straight from the pages of the comic and a decent, if indulgent, central storyline. With a full-blown war between heaven and hell at its core, it would've been very easy to get overly adventurous with the film's scope, but it wisely maintains a short focal range and that keeps things mostly grounded. It won't be finding a home on anyone's top ten list, and it's not easy to look past Keanu being Keanu (with Shia freaking LaBeouf crammed in as a throwaway sidekick), but the tone is right and the special effects work is a grand success. Not nearly what it could've been, but also not what I feared it would become.

Micro [[ASIN:0060873027 Micro: A Novel]] is a disappointment on so many levels: the characters are non-developed; the most likeable one is one of the first to get killed so we cannot identify with any hero and root for him/her; foreshadowing is clumsy and predictable; the villain is unbelievable.  The high points are the insights into insect and plant life - impeccable research by Crichton and Preston.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|This is the first time I've rated a movie on Amazon.  This movie was so good that I felt is necessary to make a statement on it.  This movie was very moving.  It focuses on the relationship between three main characters, a father and two sons.  The fight story is really just a background for the relationship story.  It could have honestly been a story about any sport or competitive effort.  I'm not all that interested in MMA, but this film really made it interesting.  I highly recommend this movie to any guy.  Whether you had a toxic relationship with your father like the characters in this film or not, the male struggle in life is easy to relate to and sympathize with.  If you want to see a great story with some really well put together martial arts scenes, this movie is well worth renting.

Isaacson does a great job giving you the information of Steve Jobs and letting you choose how to view him.  This is not a pro-Steve all the time book.  One of the best parts is towards the end when Steve is on his deathbed and asks Isaacson if there are things in the book that would make him mad.  To which the author nods yes.  Jobs' response is good, I don't want people to think this was written in house.  The book is a great read.  Jobs' drive, vision and cruelty come through in a very clear and precise story.  Some of the best stuff is the rivalry between he and Bill Gates and of course the story of Apple and Pixar.

B006PTL1GC|4.0|Based on a true story and highly influenced by the 2002 discovery of letters and diary of Sabina Spielrein.<br /><br />Keira Knightley shines magnificently as Sabina Spielrein, a spastic, neurotic, but highly intelligent patient of the young Swiss doctor Carl Jung (methodically played by Michael Fassbender). While she is neurotic her intellect still reasons. In an early scene Sabina is in a pond as the men in white coats try to persuade her out.<br /><br />The clinic director approaches her and says \\"You clearly have too much time on your hands. We must find something for you to do. What are your interests?\\"<br /><br />Sabina, \\"Suicide and interplanetary travel.\\" In this simple scene we can grasp her intellect and her issues.<br /><br />Jung allows Sabina, (who wants to be a doctor) to act as his assistant, a task she does a little too well as demonstrated with her diagnosis of patients using word associtaion. Sabina has been abused by her father. Now it gets weird. He would slap her, then make her kiss his hand afterwards. He would also spank her bare bottom, something Keira confesses caused arousal, even at an early age. She would do things which would cause her to be spanked.<br /><br />Carl Jung decides to consult some guy named Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) about this case. Mortensen plays Freud somewhat stiff, for a guy who relates everything to sex. When cocaine snorting, womanizer patient (Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross) shows up at the clinic, his unethical ways cause Jung to question his life and his relationship with Knightly who now desires sex and a good spanking.<br /><br />Freud is always pictured with a cigar in his hand or mouth(sometimes a cigar is just a cigar), but his other idiosyncrasies are not captured. Note the German custom of wearing the wedding ring on the right hand. He is involved in a lot of dialouge scenes about sex, repression, ego, and dream interpretation. What should be a five star movie from the cast, lacks action in the script and good drama in the dialouge, but does have an historical interest. Worth while rental.<br /><br />f-bomb, sex, spanking, and nudity (Sarah Marecek, Keira Knightley)nd good drama in the dialouge, but does have an historical interest.

B004VAFEE2|5.0|Cherished novelist Nicholas Sparks, writes yet another captivating, suspenseful, and romantic novel in the Lucky One. Sparks dissects the mysteries of the human heart and restores our belief in destiny through a loving bond. When Logan Thibault, a U.S. Marine from Colorado, finds a photograph of a young beautiful woman during his third tour of duty in Iraq, he suddenly encounters a wonderful stroke of luck, surviving attacks that leave many of his comrades dead.  He does not believe his luck comes from the picture until his close friend Victor persists it does. With that in mind, Logan embarks on a journey in search of the woman in the picture to thank her for saving his life. Logan's life radically alters once he meets Elizabeth, Ben, and Nana. I really find the novel captivating because of its deep plot and well developed characters who all encounter suspenseful events. The connection between the characters is not only believable but also alluring. I suggest it to all hopeless romantics. Great read.

The game itself does not fit the aspect ratio of my Droid X, and the art has been badly scaled, probably from a PC version. The text, especially on the story screens, is nigh impossible to read, and again the interface is that of a badly ported iPhone or PC game. It's an embarrassment that this game is even offered to Android users, even if it were free; that they charge money for this pile of fecal matter is an insult to customers and to Amazon's appstore.

This distance will also certainly be of significance to my opinion of the film.  I really enjoyed the angle this story was told from, the old lady getting flashbacks of her eventful life - in a stage in life where her mind is not as sharp and well functioning as it used to be - giving it a touch of reality, showing that this is a film about the life of a real person and not an icon.  I learned about where she came from and the reasons for her politics, what formed her and what she brought with her from her upbringing making her to the person she became. What it took from her to enter the men's world, how much better she had to be than her fellow male party members, how strong her beliefs were and that all these qualities became her nemesis in the end.  And the man who believed the most in her and always supportive - her husband - brilliantly performed by Jim Broadbent. I particularly loved the loving look on his face when he was looking at his wife. His character is in my opinion really adding an important perspective to the film.  Meryl Streep is wonderful - how she is able to transform into the character is amazing - this is acting of first class.  I watched this as an entertaining film and not a documentary and I really enjoyed it. It was full of tears, laughter and surprises, getting my attention all through the film, not being bored for a second. Highly recommended.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Think you for your fast and curtious service. I received my music cd and I am more than happy with your great service. I will be shopping for other great bargais in the near future. I will tell my friends where I purchased the cd. Looking forward to Doing business in the near future>
B006ON41FC|5.0|I play this every night before bed, its simple, fun, and addicting. The only thing I could ask for would be a user stats area.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Going nut is fun, addicting challenging, frustrating, exciting. My childern and I are in constant competition!  Go Nuts and Have fun!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I loved her with \\"Born to Die\\" and \\"Video Games\\" and I wasn't to sure I would like the album as a whole, but I was totally surprised at how much I couldn't get enough of it. My personal favorites are \\"Off to the Races\\" and \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" but the entire album is a listening experience. I will look forward to her new releases.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|looks great on the kindle fire....also good on my razor but a little difficult to match tiles.  overall...awesome app!!!  This is an awesome app on my kindle fire...I've been playing it all day since I downloaded it.  Thanks for offering it for free...hut I would probably buy this app but not for 5 bucks Thar's a bit pricey for any game app.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was the best in the series,and you should buy it. it kinda tells you about Lukes past... and the war with the titians. Anyways,i enjoyed it.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|the movies was better then i thought it would be i will definitely see it again. wasn't surprised about how society was because it sort of like that now tax the poor more than the rich to make sure they die in that class
B0052FG8KO|5.0|Well, Blown Away and Spellbound don't say enough.  I'd say that Journey have a genuine challenger for the greatest pop-rock band ever.  Some great guitar work on tracks 2 and 7 , and the whole package covers human emotions and leaves you on a high, just waiting to play the album again and go tell your friends about it. A terrific \\"feel good\\" album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great for everyone I approve of this app it is all my friends play it allthough it is tough to get points
B001K3ENEA|5.0|I have a pair of sony headphones that I like but I needed another pair of headphones. I have a home recording studio but I wanted my Sonys for regular iPod and computer use and I needed a pair for monitoring while in my sound booth. That was the intention for these but I like them so much I might just use these for regular use and use my sonys for monitoring. The sound is great and gets plenty loud and I can turn my computer completely up without getting a distorted sound like some headphones do. They are so light and comfortable that you almost forget that they are on your head. The elastic band inside of the head band keeps them right where you need them and works really great. Most headphones it is hard to get them to stay at the length you need.  The build on them seems like it might not last for a super long time but I don't see any reason they are going to break. Honestly I probably would not have ever considered these but Guitar Center had a Presidents Day sale and I was able to get them for $19 and I really couldn't beat it and now I'm really glad I got them.  I would totally recommend these if you get them for the right price.  If this was helpful I would really appreciate it if you hit the yes button below :) Thanks
B005T87QCI|4.0|a very fun game. people keep saying it's too hard, but I beat the entire tournament on easy in less than 2 days. I have to admit, metro gave me a lot of trouble. here's a hint: use blacktop and up your armor and power. only question is where's atom and zues and twin cities? if they added in them, I would give it 5star.
0312370849|5.0|A myriad of feelings arose in me while reading this book, love, touching, sad, angry, disgusted with others,etc  very profound. Must read
B006ON41FC|3.0|good app. keeps prompting to rate and freezing if I hit it too soon. other wise pretty fun, not a lot of upgrades or anything though
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This cover is a good substantial cover.  It is lightweight and does not add unnecessary bulk.  Stays closed without any manipulation.  However the standing function is not good at all.  Try turning it to show something to another person, it collapses.  The slightest bump - collapse!
B006FTCH2E|4.0|Brit Marling the lead actress in this film also co-wrote the film apparently as a way to get good roles to act. Her plan worked.  This film \\"Another Earth\\" has a gritty indi quality to it, and it demands more than most films from its viewers, but it's well worth the effort.  I look forward to other good stuff out of her -- both performing and writing including her other debut film \\"Sound of my Voice\\".
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|It doesn't worth the money. For the same price you can buy anything much better than that! I was expecting much more about the 3d effects. Also, if you want to see the Grand Canyon, it's not for you! As I said, DON'T BUY IT!
B000LXHK2C|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.  I have not read the book yet, but from the director's  commentary, the movie is a bit different.  Still and enjoyable watch!
B005KELWJY|5.0|I needed a cover for my new Kindle Touch.  After reading all the Amazon reviews I was totally confused so I went to a couple of brick and mortar stores to look at what was available in person.  I chose the Belkin because it fit the Kindle without a lot of elastic overlap, felt nice in my hands (like an old bound leather book), folded back nicely and closed easily.  Granted, it's still relatively new but I'm very, very happy with this choice.  The Amazon covers seemed, as others have noted, stiff and slick.  Another brand seemed kind of big and sloppy.  I'm sure there are other covers that are good, but I'm very pleased and happy I bought this one.
0312427999|5.0|Have you noticed?  It's now almost impossible to keep up with daily assaults from the far right, and not by accident, either. Reading SHOCK THERAPY - The Rise of Disaster Capitalism - by Naomi Klein, if you can stand the journey, explains in exhaustive, and sometimes horrifying detail, the \\"rolling coup\\" of out of control multi-national corporatism that really got going in South America, then spread to Russia, then to Asia, the Mid-East, Wall Street, and now engulfs the planet, with it's epicenter in Washington, and only growing stronger.  And now, proving we all hang by a thread, and coming right to our doorsteps, recent infestation of several Midwestern state capitols by pernicious and ideological shock troops only confirms the full global plan to confuse, impoverish, divide, terrify, overwhelm, and capture, using three relentless techniques: privatization, deregulation, and union-busting.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I thought this game was fun and my 4-year-old loves to watch.  The only minor drawback is starting from the same place every time.
B001GQO50I|3.0|\\"Live at the Matrix 1967\\" exists as yet another Doors \\"sampler.\\" For a commercial release, the group's historic San Francisco gig receives unconscionable bootleg treatment. However, the sound quality is far from disastrous, with classic performances of \\"The Crystal Ship,\\" \\"People Are Strange,\\" \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\" and \\"When the Music's Over.\\" Another Doors box set awaits.
