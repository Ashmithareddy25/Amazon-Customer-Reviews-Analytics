B007BVMVDU|5.0|Just awesome! Great production values, phenomenal performances, edge of seat action, great script, wonderful cinematography. Loved it, and will watch every season.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a really good film. It is not sad. It is heart-warming, touching and inspiring. It contains a few funny scenes too.<br />Both lead actors give outstanding performances. Omar Sy's dance number is great!<br />Beautiful story about life, love, acceptance and courage. I highly recommend it.
B001B0G5WA|5.0|Bought for a friend as a gift. Absolute classic. Great quality (both LP and cover). Well packaged and very well received.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This is a great snappy song that you can't help but pat your feet, clap your hands and nod your head.

B008LY5VHE|5.0|Great classic film in spite of the sometimes hokie special effects.  I lived on the water on the east coast when this was released & it made a big impression on visiting tourists.  If you haven't read &#34;Close To Shore,&#34; I recommend it.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|Works exactly as expected. Make sure you read the description and buy tags that support your device. Not all NFC is created equal.<br /><br />Good build quality, self adhesive. Super fast shipping from Whiztags. Highly recommend. No complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />Use with my Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 (2013).
B0036BP6XQ|4.0|Enjoyed Michael Oher's story, Sandra Bullock's performance & Kathy Bates totally delightful.  As an SEC sports fan, enjoyed the portrayal of division recruiting competition & cameos by the coaches.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So relevant to our time. Amazing book. I loved every bit if it. I am forever grateful to my school for recommending this book. So good. From the beginning of the novel, I was constantly crying from sadness, or crying from laughter. The only downside to this book is that your belly will hurt from laughing so hard. Good abdominal workout though...
B003Y5USG4|4.0|Who doesn't love Twister?  Love the cast & the quirky dynamics of the storm-chasing team; good special effects for the period.  Bought to add to library.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show, it covers alot of the questions you would have to ask yourself if the world were to end.
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I found this 'children's movie' to contain alot of nastiness and mild violence among so-called friends that could be very impressionable on toddlers and youngsters.  I will add that I recently saw Despicable Me 2 and thought it was great - much better handling of those aspects - or maybe I was just more prepared for it!
0124297854|5.0|Lots of useful information. This book is good to use as a reference, but also quite interesting just to browse through.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|A friend told me to watch this.  I did.  I was both educated and completely disgusted.  Everybody needs to see this.
B000B589JI|5.0|High quality, easy to use, but be careful: don't overfill this. In the desert, heat can make the fuel expand.
B000SEIK2S|2.0|I have to say I wanted to like this book. Some interesting premises and colorful aliens could not  overcome the poor plot structure and worse dialogue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was a really good game I enjoy every time I play this game. Thank you for letting me share my opinion
B00A2KJ3KG|4.0|Had a really good time reading this book.<br />I saw the movie first, and got interested about the book, and it kept me really hooked!!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I think this was a fun app. I played it for a while, but the fact that when you finished the first world, you had to keep BUYING the other worlds. . . That was kin  of why i stopped playing it. All the while, it was worth the 99&cent;.
B004UPANAI|5.0|This movie, 1st of all, pays attention to every character it introduces at the beginning, making sure each one is addressed and known, so that the plot can play out without causing the viewer to go &#34;Oh yea, they were in this movie.&#34; 2nd, the actors do a great job of portraying emotion, including Wolverine's reaction to Victor loving to hurt others so much.<br /><br />Very well done :)
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is amazing game of experience with this amazing game you can see how the true meaning of the restaurants story about food.
B000JFDBXO|5.0|I like this movie quite a lot, because there is carful attention to detail. Pays attention to plot points it brought up in the first two movies (Jeans reaction to Magneto's machine in the first film, her struggle with control in the second film, etc.) Also pays attention to the internal struggle of the younger mutants consistently, which brings in the younger crowd. Very well done :)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Split decisions for quick moves and reactions in flight as well as combat. Now this is my kind of game. I'm pretty sure any marvel fan will love this game.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|I have read a lot of these kind of books of survival during this horrible time for the Jews. This is one way to hide and survive and I liked how she did it.<br />I'm glad Edith had a brief shot as a judge, to bad the Russians took that away.<br />I would highly recommend this book and you will not be able to put it down until you finish.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I go bananas playing this game. I recommend it to everybody!!! my favorite part is having the minions in it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is simply great.  You can set multiple alarms and specify the days you wish the alarm to go off.pp<br />  Another feature I like is that you can set the ringer to gradually get louder each time it rings.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|Boasting the title \\"Black Ice\\" and several song titles that have to do with \\"rocking\\" and/or \\"rock `n' roll,\\" the fifteenth album from Aussie-based hard rock primitives AC/DC clearly leads fans to believe that this is the long-awaited follow-up to the group's iconic 1980 classic, \\"Back In Black.\\" But it isn't. And the sooner you accept that fact, the sooner you will take this album for what it is, an immensely enjoyable and mostly-satisfying effort from lead vocalist Brian Johnson and company. It is, after all, the band's first album in over eight years (it is their first release of all new material since 2000's \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\"), and that alone, is worth something. (And so is the fact that some of the band members were in their late fifties at the time of this recording.)<br /><br />True, absolutely no new musical ground is broken, here, on this 2008 release. The riffs are still as simple yet infectiously catchy as they ever were, and are driven home by strong, propulsive bass lines and simplistic, 4/4 rock-and-roll drum beats. And Johnson's wailing vocals cap the whole thing off in suitably hard-rockin' fashion. But even if the musical growth and innovation is practically zero, here, \\"Black Ice\\" is noteworthy for boasting some surprisingly mature lyricism. Indeed, AC/DC have opened their eyes and realized that there is a whole other world out there beyond alcohol and sex. Hence, some of the songs take on a mildly political feel, addressing such topics as war and greed.<br /><br />The album's lead-off track is also its first single. And boy howdy does \\"Rock `N' Roll Train\\" ever, uh, rock...and hard! As such, it has the potential to be a hit single, and a staple in AC/DC's modern-day live set, as it is an extremely catchy and contagious opener with a simple, grooving main guitar lick, some pyrotechnic soloing, strong hooks, and memorable choruses throughout. And it is immediately followed-up by \\"Skies On Fire,\\" a very repetitive but nevertheless potent number with a crashing drum beat, flowing, humming bass lines, and a hooky, punching riff slice, and the swingin' \\"Big Jack.\\" Track five, \\"War Machine,\\" which finds the band's rhythm section coming front-and-center with an ominous bass grumble and noteworthy bass intro gracing the tune's really catchy vocal refrain and memorable guitar solo, is another notable mention and possible album highpoint. Other standouts include the wailing, air-guitar-worthy leads behind \\"Spoilin' For A Fight\\"; \\"Stormy May Day,\\" a Southern-flavored rawker with sloppy slide-guitar runs; the surprisingly heavy main riff, funky, walking, Aerosmith-flavored bass line, and surprisingly epic, bluesy soloing that highlight \\"She Likes Rock `N' Roll\\"; and the piece of pseudo/near-balladry that is \\"Rock `N' Roll Dream.\\"<br /><br />Although \\"Black Ice\\" is in no way better or even as good as AC-DC's classic albums (see \\"Highway To Hell,\\" \\"Back In Black,\\" and \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheep\\"), and it does not feature any immediately accessible and/or memorable instant classics (i.e. \\"Shoot To Thrill,\\" \\"Big Balls,\\" etc.), it is still a good, very solid, and immensely enjoyable effort (with flashes of brilliance) from AC/DC, a band that has once again returned to claim its throne as the leaders of the hard rock genre.a crashing drum beat, flowing, humming bass lines, and a hooky, punching riff slice, and the swingin' \\"Big Jack.\\" Track five, \\"War Machine,\\" which finds the band's rhythm section coming front-and-center with an ominous bass grumble and noteworthy bass intro gracing the tune's really catchy vocal refrain and memorable guitar solo, is another notable mention and possible album highpoint.

B009MZQQWA|5.0|After telling my daughters (both in their 20's) the fun and social experiences created by the midnight screenings I attended as a teenager, they were interested in experiencing it.  we rented it on Amazon to do a dry-run before going to the midnight show. a great time was had by all!
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|This is a film directed by Baz Luhrmann, the man behind \\"Romeo + Juliet,\\" a modern-day Shakespeare adaptation set in \\"Verona Beach.\\" You either loved or hated it for its visual extravaganza, and now he has turned F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel into a film (and in 3D). While the film's lavish period costume (with a support from Prada and Miu Miu) captures the spirit of the jazz age, the script needs a lot of improvement.<br /><br />I don't summarize the story here. I only report that the new film adaptation begins with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a sanatorium, writing down his past experiences as therapy. It is great to see veteran actor Jack Thompson as his doctor, but the unnecessary frame narrative device only slows down the film, removing us further from the titular hero we really want to meet.<br /><br />After the visually dazzling party scene, we finally meet Jay Gatsby. Leonardo DiCaprio is effective as a man of colossal vitality, showing off his wealth for one purpose only. The film finally gets interesting as Jay Gatsby is reunited with Nick's second cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan), Gatsby's dream girl, now married to rich and pompous Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton).<br /><br />Among the melodramatic contrivances and one-dimensional characters, DiCaprio's charismatic Gatsby stands out, and his friendship with Nick Carraway is one of the most credible aspects of the film. Unfortunately, beautiful as she is, Mulligan's Daisy, who should be more ethereal and enigmatic, just doesn't convince. Also, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan appears as Meyer Wolfsheim, one of the strangest casting choices I have ever seen.<br /><br />After all this is how Baz Luhrmann envision the world of Gatsby, the jazz age with dazzling visuals and hip-hop influenced soundtrack music. Although I like it for what it is, I also feel that it's time for the director to do something different.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch this as the free app of the day on the appstore, and it is probably the best thing I've managed to get that way. I love the art style. It's also tough, but not absurdly difficult, and extremely engrossing. I've nearly missed a bus or train station on more than one occasion being caught up in some tense moments.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|It looks nice, but I think it could provide more weather information than what it does.  Does have really cool effects such as drifting coulds in the background, but not sure if I will keep it on my Kindle or not yet.
B00DUL3VFM|4.0|JUST WATCHED IT AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 10 YEARS.  IT STILL HOLDS UP.  CGI HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING IN MOVIES, BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT THIS MOVIE AT ALL.  MORE CGI WOULD HAVE PROBABLY MADE IT LOOK TOO MUCH LIKE TRANSFORMERS.  I WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED.
1468179993|3.0|gives a quick but through outline. I enjoyed the book and the authors effort to relate me to the main points needed to be presented.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I don't understand the game, it's not like the uno I have played. Rules are funny and weird. It jumps around to much.
B00D611UMM|4.0|Sheer pleasure for Moyet fans - an exceptional release highlighting her gorgeous voice with fun synthie joy!  Adele owes much to Alison Moyet, the soulful white girl who paved the way and continues to deliver!
B0045HCJKS|5.0|loved this movie when it came out...Yul is awesome...Benjiman is a dork but Yul is the main dude and he's a badaaaaa
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Great concept, lots of potential, poorly written. A lack of wit drops it from better than a 4 to a 3.
B005XLN97M|5.0|My nieces aged 8 and 3 love this dollhouse! It's quite big and pretty, and every detail of the house is very well done. I am now their favorite aunt!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Sometimes tough to separate the man from the character, and for all of Mel's egregious behavior, but this is a tremendous film worthy of accolades. Hope folks enjoy many of the rich scenes and intense moments.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. Easy to use and full of great ideas to share. I use it often for home and for my classroom.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I have purchased a total of four of the lights and I have placed a min verious locations in my home I have enjoyed these lights in the motion sensor ability to do you have to offer there's 30 there bright and the battery life last very long
B007W8S2MG|5.0|My cousin lent this game to me cuz she was really addicted to it and had played through it four or five times and couldn't put it down still.  Now I perfect understand why.  This game is very engaging.  A couple of years ago I played Persona 3 Portable briefly but didn't like it.  I've never played the original P4, though.  Apparently P4G has additional content than the original P4.  The battle system is well done.  You can get over 100 personas if you try, and it's kind of addictive to go back to the dungeons and try to acquire all these personas.  The English voice acting is excellent; me and the kids just love Teddie!  I also love the anime cutscenes, really well done! I just went beyond the \\"turning point\\" and am almost done with my first playthrough, and I'm definitely going to play it again, at the hard level next time! The amount of content is just massive. To be honest before this game I hadn't played anything truly great on my PSVita but this makes me very happy that I have a PSVita and a nice cousin!
B004EBBPU0|5.0|Great movie watched the movie TWICE. Great to watch on the HD kindle. The whole family enjoyed it. Keep up the good work Amazon.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|It is good to see another sequel to the Die Hard movie and bringing in the characters son was a cool idea. I wouldn't mind seeing another Die Hard with both characters again. I would give them an 8 out of 10 rating.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Love the photography and music. Lovely girl. Saw this years ago and enjoyed it in a different way this time.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|I really enjoyed the whole story line of the movie. It really had so many twists and turns that you didn't know what to expect next. They picked a beautiful scene for filming and you can really see the true beauty of this wonderful country.<br /><br />John Travolta really did well portraying his character and use of the accent. If you had never watched John perform before you would think he really was from Bosnia. Robert Di Niro as always does a great job and cannot complain about his role in this film.<br /><br />I did get a little annoyed with the back and forth torturing but that was what kept you waiting to see who has the upper hand next. I was a little disappointed with the outcome of the ending but then again I didn't expect that turn at all. I would like to see more films in the future with John and Robert acting together.<br />So watch and enjoy this suspenseful action film.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This book was so hard to put down that I devoured it in 3 days. The unique, original plot-line is incredibly touching.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I do wish that Morgan Freeman's role had more to it than what it did. Tom Cruise did a really good job as well as Morgan Freeman. I can't say that I would go out and buy this film because watching it once was enough.
B00CHRBA12|4.0|Nice good music !! It came when it was suppose to, the cd rocks! No problems listen to it all the time,,
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|As always Arnold Schwarzenegger does well with an action film but I think he may be a bit rusty after being out of the film industry. Pretty good story line but could see a few changes. I won't complain too much. Watch and see what you think.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Fun but predictable. A bit like a sitcom or soap opera. The characters were not particularly memorable. Not my favorite.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I love Barbara Streisand but not so much in this film. Funny but think they could have had a better actor to play her son. Not a big fan of him.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is by far one of the most beautifully designed apps I've ever seen. I love everything about this app. My only request on the next update is to add the month, day and year. Thank you for a great app. It's exactly what I had in mind.
B005VMVUAQ|2.0|I am a huge fan of Nicholas Cage but didn't care for this one at all. Not a really great story line. But that is my own opinion.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink always puts out a great CD. Never just one or two good songs. I always like them from beginning to end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Perfect for horse lovers of all ages!  My daughter could get lost in this game for hours if I'd let her.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I don't know that many people would describe this book as a mystery, but there is a nice mystery going on in this book. What is Howl's Relationship with Calcifer? But there are interesting characters, a very wonderful fantasy, and just beyond the door, the real world, yeah that world where we live, exists.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Adore period pieces and love the fact that the main characters are subject to tragedy just as any other sub-character!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My kids aged 9 and 3 1/2 love Angry birds. They both know how to play. It's very addictive. Some levels can be hard to get through, but I like the challenge.
B0026KX5PO|5.0|Always have loved this movie. Great cast, Matt Damon, Jude Law (looking his best ever), Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, among others. Loved how the story twists and turns as you watch Matt Damon immerse himself with the spoils of the rich, how badly his psyche handles rejection by the man he idolizes and how his tortured, lonely soul, desperately tries to hang onto everything by impersonating the man who rejected him but loved more than anyone knew.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|I really like this movie. Nobody would do it better than Tom Hanks. Great story line and very much inspiring.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Back covet seems real but front cover seems like a knock-off. Front doesn't lineup on top to back.  Ran under water and was okay but don't trust dropping in water for long time. Great case to keep all dirt and dust out and maybe talk in rain, but that's it!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|the story is loss but I grew up with GI Joe so I still like it. I'm glad the killed off duke never really like that character.
1781162646|3.0|King has a knack for capturing nostalgia and regret (he does it quite well in IT and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS), which makes it somewhat disappointing that he can't muster the same level of emotional import here. JOYLAND has moments that speak to the experience of adolescence, but is ultimately smothered by its put-on melancholy and endless sentimentality. It is, however, King's most efficient work in quite some time, so even if it's not as enchanting as it wants to be, it at least doesn't overstay its welcome.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I liked this movie. some of the plot twist are understandable. if you do not expect to much you will like it .
B0059XTV4Y|2.0|This movie was a real yawner..... Madonna needs to stick to what she knows. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Good calendar, takes a little bit to figure out how to edit or delete tasks but all in all is a good app.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Any one who like game like temple run,subway surfed, and robot unicorn attack u will love this game so if u have the free space on ur kindle fire download it
B00821OX98|5.0|A pure hidden gem. My husband has been watching Falling Skies from the start and thought I would check it out. Wow each episode gets better and better. Love it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|PLEASEEEEE MORE ROOMS!!! This app is great!! :D I think you should add more views, but it is really good, made me think a lot (:
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Easy and lots of fun! Great game if you like puzzles and searching for hidden objects!  Nothing too stressful! Great game!
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|5 Stars! finally got one of these of Derpy Hooves and I'm so Happy to finally have one of her to add to my My Little Pony figures! thank you so much for letting me add this to my collection. thank you
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|I would have gave it 5 stars but you had to pay for the other half of the game so it was alright idk.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|You may be really confused at first, but the confusion goes away and then it's REALLY good! I'm on the third book now and I read the first only two months ago. That's how good it is!!!! So definitely read it!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|The app streams flawlessly audio and video components. Win 8 mode is fluid and stable. You can control your PC from your tablet free from your own home within a few steps.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is way better than the movie. Like, WAY better. It has more action, it explains more, and there are parts that weren't in the movie.
B003B02O0U|5.0|Took a visit back to an old favorite. Every bit as good as I remembered!! This just might be my favorite Grisham...
B007JMW46U|5.0|As first time reader of Sherlock I was really drawn in to these short stories. Easy to read brain stimulation. Love the illustrations too, they really make it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I might have given this app four stars due to the adds, but overall I felt that this game is similar to cut the rope but only a little. I think its cute, addicting and fun to play anyone who liked cut the rope and zeptolab should totally get this game
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game it brings back my memories when I use to play this as a kid now they have it for tablets it's great. Thanks creators!!
B004V9MU86|4.0|Interesting insight into German social classes during Nazi Germany - a touch of Anne Francke story.,A very good read highly recommended
B003O86FMW|5.0|Nobody in their right mind can write a book this riveting, exciting, and extraordinairly twisted. Big Praise for Suzanne Collins!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A real fast moving movie.  A real &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34; story that held onto me like glue.  Highly recommend it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Got a little confused in the way that the time shifted back and forth .... but it was worth taking the time to sort things out !
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I love this daily workout app, I do a different one every week and it keeps me coming back because they are short workouts!
B001MSMULG|5.0|This is an addictive spy novel series - art and espionage - what's not to love!  Many great themes throughout the series - this kicks it off with danger, intrigue and lots of fun!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Perfect app for my kindle, its the last thing I check almost everyday. super simple and fast for finding out the weather!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was so good that I immediately bought the next book in the series when I finished.  I highly recommend it!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved the beginning of this book, but too many characters were introduced and richly developed who later ended up going no where or were not essential to the story.  I either wondered why did we spend so much time getting to know this character, or whatever happened to a particular character?  Disappointed.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This alarm always works unlike the standard alarm on my phone. I installed it on my phone and tablet. It does the job and is easy to set up and customize.
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|i am not sure exactly what people found about this movie that would leave them with the impression this is worth watching.THIS IS A HORRIBLE MOVIE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!! EMBARRASSINGLY STUPID,LOW-BUDGET SPECIAL EFFECTS.FELT LIKE WORK SITTING THROUGH THIS GARBAGE.NOT WORTH THE RENTAL PRICE.WHO WOULD BUY THIS CRAP TO KEEP?
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|We purchased LED Motion Sensored Night lights for our stairway & they are great.  Later we ordered 2 more for our Master Bedroom Closet & we should have done it a long time ago.  We love them.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I can't add much to all of the negative reviews except to comment on the space wasted by the outdoor activity report. Who is this pandering to? If I have just read that it's going to be 92&deg; with low winds today do I need you to tell me that it might be uncomfortable to engage in outdoor activity?  I've gone back to Weather Channel.
0425263924|5.0|I enjoyed all three books, I'm so glad that I pre-ordered this book when I was done with the second one.I did feel like the book ended on a cliff hanger, which is probably what it was intended to do so that you buy the next book. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before purchasing the books otherwise I might not have. Once I read the first book I was hooked & now I'm done with the third, I hope there is more to come & I can't wait for the next book to come out. I enjoyed this series & I'm now looking at other works by Sylvia Day.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this movie series. There is so much intrigue and so much to learn. Everyone should watch this! Also, check out the Season Premier and new episode starting September 29, 2013 on CBS.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I loved the brief addition of Bruce Willis. The action was great and while it is a fairly predictable movie it was still fun to watch.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Read this book for a Theology class (not necessarily a religious book) and the gripping poignant story line in Part I and explanation of Logotherapy in Part II are very compelling and resourceful. One I will read over and reference many times.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is a great app that I really enjoy playing. You get to watch your dragons grow up by feeding them so they grow year by year.
0762449306|3.0|I bought this in part because I thought that assembling a mini-Tardis would be a fun pre-wedding activity for me and my fiance. Be forewarned: although it is called a \\"kit\\" there is nothing to put together. It's a figurine with no assembly required. I was also expecting the windows to light up, but only the top lights up.<br /><br />All in all it is cute and will make a nice little cupcake topper. It's just not what I expected.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this app. It definitely is the one I use the most. My kindle comes to work with me everyday, and this calculator stays open the whole time I'm working. I don't know what I'd do without it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook opens up in widescreen, but crashes and closes as soon as the screen is filled upright. It won't open in the lengthwise position. Is it a bug that'll be fixed in the next update? I just got my new kindle fire hd 8.9 yesterday and already I'm having problems...=(<br />I've deleted FB and redone loaded it, I've wiped the kindle clean and started at factory specs, I've turned it on n off...nothing seems to fix the problem.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|I like the layout. Good app. Very clean UI and it looks really nice on my Nexus 7 2013. Definitely install it.
0425267695|5.0|-Really enjoyed most of the book (except maybe 1 chapter)<br />-I was imediately taken in from the beginning all the way through until (that 1 chapter I just referenced).<br />-Lots of characters but not hard to keep up with them (especially with the appendix in the back listing all characters and their titles, etc.)<br />-Main character is a very strong and good hearted person.<br />-I thought I read or heard there was magic in this book......I guess you could say there is, but it's not like traditional magic or anything straight forward.....what a few people have in this book is more of an &#34;instinctual gift&#34; if you will, or something along those lines.  No raw magic or any magical concepts.  Mostly swordsmanship, combat, fighting, spirits, evil, LOTS OF FAITH and religion stuff in this book but it's not annoying, confusing, or anything.  It just helps develop the characters, story, & world.<br /><br />-The only boring part in this book was when they went to the desert and fought a battle just off the beach.  Basically, just before he earned the name &#34;Hope Killer.&#34;  This was about a chapter or 2 long.  It wasn't bad, but compared to the rest of the book it was definitely the less interesting part to me.  Bored with generic battle fights and hearing about troops being slain, but as soon as he took action to become the &#34;Hope Killer&#34; it picked back up.<br /><br />-The book was a solid/constant tempo the whole way through, got boring during a chapter or 2, then picked back up to finish the book.<br /><br />Solid book.  Really enjoyed it.  I always like happy endings with great closure and people getting what they want after overcoming great losses and sacrifices....this book didn't have all that.  Had solid closure, but not the happiest.<br /><br />Go pick this book up!
B000OB5UU0|4.0|Great documentary for Metallica fans, although I expected there to be crazier shit shown on the documentary from all of the hype this release got, but this does give fans a better insight as to the dynamics of the group. I wish they would have shown a little bit more in depth footage of Jason Newstead's departure and more behind what led up to Dave Mustaine's reappearance. This documentary does make me want to enjoy &#34;St. Anger&#34; a little bit more but I am not sure if that is possible in comparison to their other releases. At the end of the day I think music lovers will enjoy this video.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book while vacationing on the lake with my family. My brother and sister in law and myself read this book over about 4 days! We all liked it a lot. The ending leaves me wanting more and it would be great to have a sequel but all in all great summer read full of excitement and guessing games which I love!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was well-written and flowed smoothly with a plot that has a lot of symbolism - symbolism that you may not catch until the end of the novel. Even without the symbolism, the novel stands on its own - some fantasy with a few horror elements thrown in for good measure.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great show.  I still think I liked Stargate SG1 better but this compliments it well.  Wish they never stopped making either one of them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Held my attention from start to finish. Interesting concepts. Can't wait until I read more by Hugh Howey. You can't go wrong with this one if you like Sci Fi at all.
B007M45PMU|4.0|This is a good album but its relatively short. I like that it isn't like most of the music played on the radio.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A children's classic adults will love. Brings out the child thirsting for adventure within us all. Definitely a great read.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really recommend to have it on your phone or kindle. I love the app upgrade, the different pics and how it looks now. It's much better now!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a great series.  I can't wait till the next book comes out.  This reminds me of the fifty shades of grey somewhat.
1401322786|3.0|I have read all of Mitch Albom's books and found them to be really interesting.<br />I think he has a verys sensitive soul, but I have to admit this last one is one of<br />the strangest stories I've read in a long time.  Maybe I just didn't catch his point!<br />Anyway, to me it seemed rather meaningless and about two very self absorbed people.<br />Clue me in, other reviewers if I'm just missing the point.
B002722R64|4.0|Refreshing to have a female equal to 007 in a genre that used to be quite sexist. the required sarcasm and heavy action were entertaining.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|My only thing was it was bigger than expected lol.  I know that's an odd complaint but I'm using it to strap on to a stroller for quick grab purposes but other then that wipes stay moist and easy to use.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app saves me a lot of time compared to the stock keyboard that came on my galaxy s3. The fact that they added swipe makes it twice as cool.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I had fun on a very rainy day figuring out all of the puzzles.  They are varied so it is never boring to play.
B007BLDFWG|2.0|It was very slow.  The preview made it seem spooky and scary.  It was not scary at all.  I would not recommend this movie.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|Gets the job done. This is the 2nd tripod of this kind that I've purchased from Amazon. The first one broke within a couple weeks. I ended up re purchasing since I wanted another and it's pretty cheap. The second one lasted a bit longer and I tried to keep it in really good shape. But, once again it broke after a while. The tripod part snapped off so I took the top part (where the phone slips in) and attached it to my normal tripod. Works okay.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This history book is excellent.  It will hold your interest and make you sympathetic to Jesus and the Jews, although some of the upper class and high priests weren't such good guys themselves.  I would recommend this book.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|Heavy rock and R&b sound that can't be beat. Just saw them at Outside Lands in San Francisco and they out on a great show.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Outstanding. I like the way the book  went from one character to the other telling  the reader their side. Each was convincing. It was truly a thriller, well thought out with a most surprising ending. I rated it so high for the suspense factor.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|A fine film which has one guessing quite a way through it.  I never read the comic book on which it is based, but it is a fine story of the human spirit and the craving for justice,  A must see.
B005544TRQ|5.0|You won't regret it. So entertaining, great characters. Mad men meets law and order meets... CSI, maybe? Love this show
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|This season has some crossover with DS9, Q returns, and even has Stephen Hawking appear as a guest appearance. It's a solid season of a great show!
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This is a very good Reacher book and a little different.You have 4 living memebers of a team looking for 4 others. Very different characters each from the other. A good read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was great I laughed and I cried would tell anyone who loves dogs to read this book. Why he would want to come back human is the one thing I do not see.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Have loved the show sense it started. Although it's not my favorite season -- that would be five -- season 6 does not disappoint :D
B007RCJNDE|5.0|One of the best Fantasy series of books I have read. Albeit a long series. This last book really pulled everything together in a marvellous conclusion weaved so well by Brandon Sanderson who must have worked so hard to both understand and interpret Robert Jordan's dream as well as he has. An Epic
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Had to keep turning the page to see what subtle twist would happen next.  Has moments of ironic hilarity and not much sobriety.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Good game wish gems more abundant and gold easy to get for new ppl and a fue starting dragons ps not enough species
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is a fun crime drama.  It is light on the blood and guts, with a bit of comedy mixed in.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I like reading the dictionary to and its nice for me and my friends and mother and sister and son
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|If you ever played cube runner and love zombies then you just get this game. It's got great controls and solid weapons for killin the undead
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This cover is compact and stands up as an easel when you want, useful for watching streaming videos on the Kindle. It's covered in a textured synthetic leather with smooth leather back and spine. The inside is a suede-like synthetic. Four plastic clips hold the Kindle (Fire only, not HD version) and you simply turn the Kindle on the side and pull it out slightly and the back folds to make the easel. The clips do not interfere with the buttons. The elastic strap holds the cover closed when you are not using the unit. You can fold the cover more for typing, less for viewing.<br /><br />I did not notice any synthetic leather odor. It was fine right out of the box.<br /><br />A good cover makes using the Kindle a lot more convenient. This cover does the job just right.
B000F8O35U|5.0|this is a great product. i would recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product. shipping was on time and quality was great
B00005B36H|4.0|sound wise this album is amazing there are songs in there iv been listening for more than a year and i stiil head bang the hell too them.<br />meaning wise it's deep, I'v red the countless solvings of fans for the track but this album wants you to go through a spiritual process witch I havnt yet lol not enough for this album at least to really understand what theyre singing about but great album hat off hands down
B003DZX3SA|5.0|this is a great product. i would recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product. shipping was on time and quality was great
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|this album is beautiful on the stereo and the disc itself.    If your a John Frusciante Fan you will enjoy listening to this s*** in your car :)
B00005KAQP|5.0|One of those movies my entirely family adored growing up, there is such staying power in Whoopi's hilarious 1992 cult classic about a lounge singer on the run from her gangster boyfriend.<br /><br />`Sister Act' stars Goldberg as a sharp tongued singer trying to make ends meet while singing in a Supremes type tribute back that gets gigs in casinos and bars.  She's linked to a married man, who just so happens to be a wanted criminal, and when she witnesses something she wasn't supposed to, she going into immediate hiding.  The one place no one would look for her is the one place she would rather not go, but before she knows it she's packing it in with nuns at the local convent.  Her shady backstory is replaced by a fake one, so as to keep the innocence of the rest of the nuns, and soon she is making a bigger impact than she even thought she would, especially in the choir department.<br /><br />`Sister Act' is a rousing good time that hands Goldberg a plum role for her kind of humor.  She's cleaner than usual, but with the edge needed to give this staying power and make it believable.  The rest of the supporting cast is clearly up for the challenge as well, with Maggie Smith giving her usual cranky turn and Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena serving up hilarity as the worldly un-wise `sisters'.  It is Harvey Keitel that really slams it out of the park here with a fun yet commanding presence.<br /><br />The musical numbers are spunky and fresh and the climax is filled with unexpected tension and a wonderful moral center.  This is one of Goldberg's true triumphs as an actress, and this film is one of those blockbusters that earned it's keep and continues to entertain!
B00AQB2A3I|4.0|Steven Wilson never disappoints. Whether it be with Porcupine Tree, Storm Corrosion, his production with Opeth, or his solo work. I'm a fan of whatever this guy does musically. Also you can't go wrong with Nick Beggs on bass...
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Little hard to figure out but still trying. Love it. Very enjoyable. And fun. Can't wait to show my granddaughters. Yes. Yes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting, once you start, you can't put it down. Update took forever to download on kindle fire, but worth the wait
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this on facebook all the time-still learning Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Hard to post more until I accomplish this, being 74 I'm not as tech savy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This was easy to download onto my new Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  My books showed up right away and are easy to read.
B00A6CT012|4.0|Wow. I'm impressed with her devotion to having zero waste.  Lot's of great ideas and a few that I probably won' do myself, but am on my way to less waste in my home.
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes was the only comic I read regularly when I was a kid and I read them religiously and got the various collections as they came out when Watterson was still writing the strip.  This was a great read and it was so good to go back through the strips.  The physical books themselves are beautifully constructed, bound and printed and I didn't mind at all lugging them around the apartment....you will want to be sitting at a table or something when you read them because they're too heavy to hold in your lap for a long time!
1568363931|5.0|These recipes make lunch fun and enjoyable. It has both traditional and not so traditional recipes. It also gives you suggestions for different versions of the same recipe. Want to make bentos? This book is for you!
0670014893|4.0|Enjoyed this story and really liked the way it moved.  Don't want to spoil the story so will just say the plot construction worked for me and I enjoyed the themes.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|Best product I've used. None of the pain of waterproof earbuds. Easy to maintain fidelity with head above water using soft earplugs or simply placing the bone conductor at the opening of the ear canal. I can swim laps til the cows come home.
B005DZMODI|1.0|Thought this would be great, big fan of all the elements. I was so wrong. It's garbage. Listen before you buy.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I am so glad that I watched this movie!  Goes to show that everyone has issues.  We just hope to have just as good friends to stick by your side.  You can always come out the other side brighter and wiser!
B001EBWING|5.0|I think it is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Still a timely theme seventy years after its debut.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I am a bit of a si fi geek discised as a High Maintenance Princess!  I have seen every Marvel's movie and love them all!
193700788X|5.0|I absolutely love this book series.  It started to drag a little by the second to last book so I am glad that the series has finally ended.  Thankfully the ending was sweet and fit right in with Sookie and her life story.
B008GJV2OA|5.0|Just as funny now as it was during the Cold War. We miss you, Peter Sellers! You, too, Slim Pickens!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|and I loved this book.<br />I have honestly wondered at times 'what if' President Kennedy hadn't died.  I really can't say more, I don't want to ruin it for anyone that hasn't read it yet!  This is one of Stephen Kings best works I think.  :)
B0036EH3U2|5.0|My favorite show of all time!!! I just received the silver boxed Blu-ray set and it arrived in PRISTINE condition. All discs were secured and no scratches on any of them.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book should be covered in schools it's that well written. Do yourself a favor and read before movie comes out.
B002QNEJT2|5.0|HD quality was great. Streamed without any problems.<br /><br />Dexter is always fun. If you're reading this you don't need to know that. (:
B004S699HC|5.0|Do not let anyone tell you this is a poor remake of the original. The film is absolutely beautiful, but if you're one of those closed-minded fans who only like The Crow because of Brandon Lee, you will never give this sequel a chance to prove that it could be just as good as the original.<br /><br />The storyline is a good one. Avenging your son's death rather than your girlfriend's is a lot more deep. Sarah is gorgeous and has a dark sense of style. Vincent Perez was also a fine choice to play Ashe.<br /><br />There are some very beautiful quotes in the film too.<br /><br />There really is nothing wrong with this film. I don't have the slightest clue why people hate it.<br /><br />Stop criticising this movie! The Characters are different, The actors are different, the villains are different and technically the story is different, for in the first movie, It's Eric Draven's Fianc&eacute;e that gets murdered and the \\"sequel\\", It's Ashe's SON that get's murdered.<br /><br />O.K. maybe i'm wrong, it more likely is a sequel. But it's not a sequel to the first crow film, it does not follow the same story, it's about a completely different person.<br /><br />The message I'm trying to get through to you is: \\"Stop thinking of it as a sequel. Think of it as it's own movie, THEN you'll enjoy it better.\\" Just give the damn movie a chance.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a great and gripping series.  I love it!  Keeps your attention the entire time and makes you want to continue to watch episode after episode
B005EY2XFC|5.0|This is one amazing film, with a mesmerizing performance from Brandon Lee!. It's visually appealing, extremely well made, with amazing performances all around!. Loved the score, too, it fit with the film well, and there's plenty of action to go around as well. Michael Wincott is, very menacing as the main villain, and was perfect for the part. The flashbacks were very cool, however I wished, I could see more of Shelley's character. The Directing is outstanding!. Alex Proyas does an outstanding job here, creating lots of, dark atmosphere, great use of the rain machine, cool visuals, and keeping the pace, action packed, and engrossing all the way!. The film is very violent, but not all of it is bloody. We get several knives in the chest, knife in the hand, lots of gunshot wounds, some bloody, some not, hole through hand, 2 slashing's, slit throat,2 bloody impaling's, sword in the neck and a crow pecks a girls eyes out. The Acting is WONDERFUL!. Brandon Lee, gives an Oscar worthy performance here, he is completely mesmerizing, creepy, kicks that ass and, just thought he was too cool, his AMAZING performance here, will always be remembered, what happened too him was a tragedy, and i for one will never forget him!. Rochelle Davis is awesome here, and is very likable, her and Brandon, had very good chemistry and is one of the best kid actors out there!, especially since she hasn't acted since then!. Ernie Hudson, is terrific as the Sgt., very likable, and very convincing. Michael Wincott, is great as the main villain, I loved his voice, and he was very menacing!. Sofia Shinas, is very good as Shelley, however, she didn't have much screen time, but was great when on screen. Overall a MUST SEE at all costs!.<br /><br />I Give This Film a 5 out of 5 Or an A+main villain, I loved his voice, and he was very menacing!. Sofia Shinas, is very good as Shelley, however, she didn't have much screen time, but was great when on screen. Overall a MUST SEE at all costs!.<br /><br />I Give This Film a 5 out of 5 Or an A+
B007N579X6|5.0|I wouldn't have believed that this movie would be one of my all time favorite animated movie but sometimes it nice to be wrong! Kids should love it and adults can appreciate it. Looked flawless and sounded awesome. Just buy it and enjoy :-)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|this show has an interesting storyline, awesome actors, and is one of the best dramas on par with shows usually reserved for cable (think Rome or Game of Thrones). i recommend it.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A bit scray at times, but mind blowing scenary and animations. What imagination and execution of picturization. This comes with 3D and non-3D DVDs.
B00CRS88IO|2.0|I know it's a novel but stealth helicopters in early WWII ?, give me a break. There was no need to include technology of today into that era. It made the read hard to keep going. I finished it but it was not easy.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Terrible new version. It was changed without any warning. I deleted it almost immediately. (Went to accu-weather.) You ruined a good thing. People's lives literally depended on you. You should be ashamed, Weather Channel.<br />bfh
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I love the cast!!!! Can you say Powerhouse? The storyline is great!!!! I can't wait for part 2!!!! I can watch thus movie over and over!!! Guilty...Already have.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Enjoyed the entire CD, not just four or five cuts.  Will most certainly order their next CD due out in late August.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I read the Alchemist during a relaxend holiday in France. Being in the mediterranian added up to the welk Laid out atmosphere of the book. It is a masterpiece, both in its description of human nature and physical nature
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series! The acting is top notch, the costumes are lovely and look authentic to the period, and the Abbey & grounds are beautiful. You get the feeling you have stepped back into the late Edwardian/early Georgian era. Now that I'm caught up with Season 3, I'm eagerly awaiting the start of Season 4 this fall. I highly recommend it. Thank you Amazon for making seasons 1-3 available on Prime and in HD quality.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|i bought this movie for my wife because shs wore out the first one she had,great movie,great price what more can i say
B000I2JI80|5.0|Really pleased with the quality of skin tones on this film. Gorgeous for portraits, especially when rated at 200 ASA
B00AREIAI8|4.0|One of the better games I've downloaded, fun to play. The advertisements are a bit repetitive and a tad annoying but they don't bother game play too bad.
1907563202|2.0|Well, I'm a beginner. While the ideas are certainly cute, they are not as easy to follow as the previous reviews would lead you to think. The directions to create the projects leave a lot to be desired. Let's face it, if you're a beginner you shouldn't need to go to a class on crochet to follow and make the pattern, especially when the title includes \\"Learn Crochet with these 35 adorable projects\\". I've started something in the book. Tuesday I will go to a veteran crocheter to better understand what the heck Nicki is saying so that I can finish the project for which I've already spent money on the purchase of lots of yarn!!!!.....I'm pissed off because it shouldn't be necessary based on the way the book markets itself.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The Good Wife, season 2, which I never saw when it aired on network TV, is addicting, it is so good.  The acting, story line, etc. keeps one riveted to the screen.  I have finished the first 2 seasons and now am on season 3.
B005T87QCI|4.0|I thought all the characters would be in the game but it's still really fun and there is still some robots from the movie like Midas,Noisy Boy,Ambush, and Metro
B00AVFO41K|5.0|Finally, a match up game with some actual difficulty and strategy involved. The people who can't figure this out should stick with the match 3 and get a gold star in your forehead and a balloon. Not tough to figure out but thought required.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|LOVE,LOVE it. Great game. I look forward to playing this game when ii get the chance. This game is AWESOME.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Did you like pulp fiction? Same genre. This crossed the generational divide. Required viewing before Red 2, then you can see it again.
B009ME47H2|5.0|Found this by accident. This comes in very handy for lots of things so II don't forget. This is just a recorder not for email use.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I don't know why, but people who are pompous are fun to watch.<br /><br />Two themes of note:<br />- lying and deception: The show constantly plays with the idea of lying: wanting to lie and wanting to be honest; needing to lie and needing to be honest; exploiting people by deception and impressing them with honesty.<br />- compassion and selfishness: The characters are rewarded for their charity and self-centeredness. They are also penalized for both.<br /><br />Absorbing and entertaining.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Found this app and I use it all the time for my notes now. Grocery shopping,shopping, yard sales. I keep track of my yard sales and such.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Had to watch this before I went to see the new one in the theaters. What a great movie....both of them were actually.<br />Immediately came home and pre-ordered the new one.  It is a have to have DVD.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is fun fun fun. I play it a lot and its great. you can play against your facebook friends.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this workout DVD. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now (still on level 1) and I have already noticed a change in my body and endurance. I love that it is a mixture of cardio, strength and abs. What I love this most is that it is a great, effective workout in 20 minutes. You can't beat that.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I  liked the game but there are so many good ones out there. This is a little slow for me.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series is so well cast.  All of the actors and actresses are just so well suited to their roles.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Best one yet dont wait for another dungeon hunter I don't think they could do any better why don't you try me
B008F9T76Q|4.0|Great books! I somehow accidentally ordered the UK publications.  Not a big deal or anything but it was a little odd.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was just the awesomest book ever! I was soooooo happy when percy and annabeth finally became more the friends! I recommend this to everyone!!
B009MYARIK|2.0|I tried to get into this book, but found my mind wandering!!! I don't think I will ever finish it..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is my favourite favourite game!!! It`s the best game I ever seen for tablet or smartphone!You MUST \\"bought\\" it!!! I love it...
B007L5LD9O|5.0|This is an excellent rendition of the classic Jane Austen novel.  Paltrow and Collette are especially fine; all of the casting is outstanding.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter enjoys the running themed games (temple run, subway surfers, etc) and she loves despicable me. So when the two merged together I figured it would be awesome. I was right. She loves this game. Really solid purchase. If your child enjoys the genre and the style of play download this app today.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how you can do a plan and read a few testamonials a day for the calendar year and have the whole bible read by the end of year
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I think TMSOFT's White Noise app is the best Android noise masking/sleep aid app in the app store; it has been a worthy replacement of the excellent Sleep Machine app I used to use on iOS.  Sleep Machine is able to blend multiple sounds together, so I was able to make a custom sound that exactly masked the environmental noises I was trying to suppress.  As other reviewers have noted, White Noise does not have that ability but it has so many sounds available that I was able to find exactly what I wanted (for me, that's the Brown Noise sound).<br /><br />Another key feature I needed was the ability to run in the background. I've had great success falling asleep by starting White Noise, then playing an audiobook in a different app with a sleep timer running in that app. I kind of have to listen \\"through\\" the white noise to hear the audiobook but I find that makes the white noise even more effective in blocking environmental noise.  Then after I'm asleep and the sleep timer turns off the audiobook, White Noise is still merrily blocking those external sounds.  This may be unusual but it's is an important feature to me and White Noise does it perfectly.<br /><br />So, this app is great as a sleep aid (and can also be good at work if you've got noisy neighbors).  However, I can only hesitantly recommend this app because of the permissions it requests.  I do not understand why a sound machine/alarm clock needs full network access.  I can sort of see the Phone calls permissions, maybe it needs those to turn itself off when a call comes in (though why does it need the identity of the caller?).  I can see the Storage permissions as maybe that's how it reads/writes its large and expandable sound library.  But having full Network Communication access really makes me leery. I know some apps will need network access to display ads in their free versions but then don't need it when you go to the ad-free paid version.  I wish TMSOFT would follow that model, and get rid of the network access requirement (as well as the utterly superfluous social features that might also necessitate it).k access requirement (as well as the utterly superfluous social features that might also necessitate it).
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|It was delivered very quickly even though I am based in The Philippines.<br /><br />Upon opening the box (well packaged) and plugging it in, it worked a treat. Sound quality is good and does exactly what I need it to do.<br /><br />The only things I found a little annoying, was there is no on/off indicator and I had to guess which way the battery went.<br /><br />Other than that, it is awesome.<br /><br />Tim Bennett
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Three different tip sizes of soft rubber and stores anywhere a regular pen goes.  It can be used on small phone screens as well as larger computer touch screens.
B004ZJZQ7O|1.0|The Blu ray didn't work but the dvd did but I really wanted the blu ray to work because I love this movie.
0321934962|5.0|John is an accomplished writer and he takes time to make sure that the reader understands and knows how to use their new camera.  He makes suggestions as to how to improve your photos and gives the reader concrete sets of ISO, Aperature, and Shutter speed in each of his photo examples.  This book is easy to read and the lessons are easy to follow.
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|Tom Cruise is terrific once again.  I desperately want that computer screen set up, especially the glove.  I understand this is under development.  The carved balls made no sense.
B009AMANBA|1.0|I wanted to love this film. I am a lifelong Civil War buff. I have spent decades reading everything I could concerning that period. I just admire President Lincoln immensely. I even named my son after my Great grandfather who was a Union Army Captain. This film was low keyed, a bore, corny, inaccurate. The soldiers looked moronic in a couple scenes. I could go on. Probably a good school kids impression of Abe. I wish BBC would have made the film.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|Read the Philip K. Dick novella, &#34;Do Androids dream of electric sheep&#34; before seeing this flix.  This fills in the pieces you don;t know you are missing!  Great film on its own merit.
B009YN2M7S|3.0|It seems this author takes any story heard on the nightly news and creates yet another formulaic novel...unfortunately his past success at this game pretty much guarantees his readership will try again.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Sorry, but I fell asleep. Was this for real? Too predictable ... Too formulaic...Notmy cup of tea at all. Forget it!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Don't know how it plays on other devices, but on the Kindle Fire (regular, not HD) it's very jerky.  Either the input isn't quite sensitive enough or the game-play is touchy, either way it was slow in responding and caused my minion to die multiple times.  Add to that a lengthy download and large memory requirement makes this a non-keeper.
0307596885|5.0|Another wonderful Munro addition for my personal library. I am not articulate enough to do justice for Alice Munro in a book review. Suffice to say, I keep this book next to the bed. I am slowly savoring it over the summer, and am very pleased with myself for treating myself to it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Based on some of the poor reviews, I didn't expect much from this. I was wrong to be so pessimistic. Aside from casting Russell Crowe, a big mistake, the other casting choices were great. Performances were strong. I understood the story before from having seen the show on Broadway, but I understood it much better after the film. Film was able to give some intimate shots that live theater doesn't do nearly so well, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />Any show that makes me choke up and even cry several times during the space of nearly three hours gets a thumbs up from me. Drop the comparisons to live theater and see this for what it is: a great story told by great actors (Anne Hathaway was amazing, Hugh Jackman was simply terrific) with wonderful music. I've watched it twice and loved it both times.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great acting, story line is compelling, additional historical information informative. Something you can watch many times without ever getting bored.
B005LJETYI|4.0|Aside from its one gimmick there really isnt all that much to this book.<br />But it has action and a cool premise and it basically just does what it says on the tin: mech, aliens, and groundhoug day.<br />I enjoyed it.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|For the unaware, AMD and Intel chips are not directly comparable. AMD has 2 integer units per module that share resources. For AMD, 4 cores = 4 threads. For Intel, 4 hyperthreaded cores = 8 threads. Intel's parts have the advantage in efficiency and performance here, but saying that this CPU only has 2 cores is hogwash. So if anyone tries to sell you that line, especially intel fanboys that leave nasty, 1 star reviews on amazon, tell them to screw off.<br /><br />This thing is not slower than any i3 (this point is arguable for single threaded performance). There isn't an i3 that runs faster than 3.5 ghz that I know of. This runs at 4.4 ghz and has 4 cores. Intel's IPC is generally greater than AMD's so we're not really comparing apples to apples. It's more like we're comparing 2 peaches to 4 plums.<br /><br />It does use a lot more power, though it's power consumption is impressively low during idle. I think AMD could improve on this point, but it's not going to run up your electricity bill. And (un)fortunately, you can't use it to heat your house. The 6800k can use up to 100 watts where the top i3 will use up to 55 watts. That's not to say that the 6800k will always run at 100 watts and the i3 always runs at 55 watts. The 6800k actually draws less power at idle than an i3 I believe.<br /><br />The iGPU is decent. It's not meant for performance gaming. It's meant for entry level gaming. It beats the i7 4770's hd 4600 iGPU. The iris pro 5200 could trump the 6800k's hd 8670d, but I don't believe you can actually buy a processor with iris pro graphics. I'm pretty sure they have to be soldered to the motherboard and I'm pretty sure they have a hefty price tag.<br /><br />This thing has a place. It might not be in high-end gaming. It adequately fills a void between the lightweight systems meant for internet browsing and the middleweights that require dedicated graphics. It's great for home theater PCs and entry level gaming. Don't expect playable framerates with high settings in the most current games, but you can play most games at medium to low settings. Skyrim, for example, will put out about 35 fps on medium preset.<br /><br />My personal recommendation would be to buy this if it's what you need or if you're on a budget but want decent performance BUT DON'T FORGET TO GET FAST RAM. She can handle 2133. If you want low powered, go intel. If you want to go big, start with an amd fx 6300 or a lower intel ivy bridge i5, then get the graphics card you want, then focus on your other components. With whatever $ you have left over, you can then splurge on a faster cpu.<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|What I really wanted was the app to play the game on my Kindle. I didn't need help on the levels.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|What a great family movie!  We currently own the regular DVD and I then purchased the Blue Ray.  Can't wait to purchase Despicable Me 2!
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This version of Judge Dredd captures the dark, chaotic, corrupt, polluted world that I always envisioned the Dredd universe to be.  Excellent movie.

B002W7J3SO|5.0|While &#34;Northwest By Northwest&#34; isn't necessarily mentioned in the short list of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, it may well be the single most entertaining -- in turns exciting, funny, stylish, sexy and intelligent. It's also Hitchcock's ultimate &#34;wrong man chased by both bad guys and good guys&#34; scenario - and defined the modern spy thriller as a roller-coaster thrill ride. It predated - and heavily influenced - the James Bond films starting with &#34;Dr. No,&#34; which came out three years later. In fact, the Bond producers originally wanted Cary Grant to play Bond but knew he would only have done it for one film.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A different kind of story...great immagination. Very entertaining.<br />No explanation for the mysterious people but you can't help falling in love with them.
B003KRLKHC|1.0|I'm a sci fi, and fantasy fan. (spoiler alert)  I found this hard to follow, with good action, and a lose link to a (spoiler alert!)  holy book.<br /><br />The plot was pretty slow and there wasn't any character development.<br /><br />All main actors did really well with what they were given.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Within 10 minutes of receiving the item I was watching YouTube on my TV using chromecast. It is very easy to setup . I am very pleased with it. It will only get better with future updates and as more developers get on board.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|I liked this movie, which I can't say about many date night movies.  It was funny and had a good twist to it.  I would recommend this to any couple for a date.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Didn't think I would like the book.......Was not what I expected......I learned a lot about myself.....Worth reading even for the husband.......
B008Y768XO|5.0|I laughed and cried in this movie.  It cheered me and then broke my heart, One of the most heart warming movies in a long time.  The fact it was based on a true story made it even more heart warming.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book sooooooo much! It was also very convenient to be able to read it on my tablet for school. My only problem was that when I needed to locate and quote my evidence for my answers, the page was different then what it is in the actual book.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Clever, funny, exciting, touching. I've wanted to become a &#34;Whovian&#34; for years, but I just didn't have the time. Now that I find all the seasons streaming from my Kindle, I'm loving it! I think it's time to get my own Sonic Screwdriver!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I don't see what people get so worked up over? it works just fine for me and I don't have any problems with the downloads they sound just fine. honestly it's really great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a fun app and is a joy to play and the best part is you can buy a unicorn!!!!!
B008VBYN80|3.0|Developers deserve to be paid for their well designed games, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that I would prefer to pay up front for the game and then be free to enjoy the game without adds or being hit upon for more money. I would even pay a subscription for a month`s worth of game access. This is the primary reason for downgrading the game.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|No heart in this movie.  Everyone just kind of mailed it in.  That's from the writers to the actors.  Hell, bad TV was more entertaining and lesss expensive.  Pass on this movie and watch Suits, or Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones.
0767919408|5.0|The summer of 1927 seems a rather odd time for Bill Bryson to pick out to write a book about but in fact a lot of interesting things happened that summer. Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic. Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs while playing on the greatest baseball team to ever put on a uniform. The murder (considered the murder of the century at the time) that the movie, \\"Double Indemnity\\" was based on occurred. The men who caused the Great Depression got together and made their plans. TV showed Herbert Hoover who was busy saving the middle of the country from the worst flooding of the Mississippi River in our history. And our president, Calvin Coolidge sat around not doing much of anything.  And let's not forget Henry Ford practically destroying his company by switching from the Model T to the Model A without any real plan.  Of course, lots of things were in the middle of happening and Bryson squeezes them in.  Charles Ponzi of the notable Ponzi scheme was serving his prison term and we hear about him. Al Capone was enjoying Prohibition and making lots of money and attending the Jack Dempsey/Gene Tunney fight.<br /><br />Bryson writes about anti-semitism and eugenics which were widespread in the US and helped make the KKK the strongest it had ever been.  The eugenics movement especially was widely popular among scientists in the US and their writings were even used by Nazis in their defense at Nuremberg.  But then he writes about the first talking pictures and how they and radio changed the country.  In other words, this really is a book about a time and not just one part of that time.  Don't like a topic?  Don't worry, in a few pages Bryson will be telling you about something else.<br /><br />And that is the fun of this book. Bryson gives us lots of events and he writes about them with just enough information and in a fun way to keep the book moving. But the best part is that Bryson writes about people. Yes, there are events but he makes us see the people that are underlying those events and that makes everything much more real. Bryson has a great style of writing and I really think you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />I will add one thing about the actual history.  I'm not sure how accurate the history is in general but I know one thing is definitely wrong.  Bryson says that Clara Bow's career as an actress ended when talkies came out because her Brooklyn accent was like nails on a blackboard.  Actually nothing could be further from the truth.  Bow's career in talkies was highly successful.  As one producer at the time said, Bow was worth an extra million dollars in any film she was in.  She released nearly a dozen talkies and was the second biggest actress at the time behind only Joan Crawford.  Bow's career ended because she was suffering from problems with her emotional health and retired from acting in 1933.underlying those events and that makes everything much more real.

B00AEFY66U|5.0|This is a great movie.  It is done so much better than the one that came out in 2013.  I recommend it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonderful book for all ages. Strength, courage and quality of spirit are superbly presented.  We should all be as strong and clear of character as Augur.
B00992CF6W|5.0|cool minecraft it is like pc  but no villages thought.but it is still cool.there is a cool update 0.7.1.it has buckets and spaners pig sheep cow chicken.plus if you hsve luncher pro you can play on realms.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Very interesting time period and mystery with lots of cunning intrigue!  The author did a good job of making each character come alive with their own personalities.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|My 4-star review (subject to change) is based on the fact that the Chromecast, in a year's time, could be an amazing fully functional value at $35.  But that all depends on what type of app support and additional functionality they build into.  As an early adopter, I'm not disappointed, but it's not quite an elite device right out of the box, either.<br /><br />The important thing to recognize about the Chromecast is that streams independently from your WiFi connection, but is controlled by another device (PC, Mac, iPhone, Android, etc.) on that WiFi network.  That's both good and bad.<br /><br />The good is that streaming on something like Netflix seems to go extremely well once you get it started up.  You're also free to close the app and do other things on your phone, even if you used the app to start the video.<br /><br />The bad side of the design choice they made is that there isn't any real \\"remote\\" for the Chromecast itself.  Android and Apple may offer one soon (much like the Apple TV \\"Remote\\" app), but at launch, none is available.  This can make navigating content a little clumsy.  It's best done with a smartphone running a supported app, but the only supported apps are YouTube, Netflix, and Google Play, which is a woefully underpowered lineup.<br /><br />Of course, you do have the ability to stream from the tab on your Google Browser, BUT, it needs to be a laptop or other computer on the WiFi network.  For most, this will probably be the case, but our house computer is a wired desktop, so no go.  I expect this device to improve a ton in the near future, and if it does, it's a great addition to the marketplace.  But it's definitely more of a \\"secondary\\" TV device compared to full-function boxes like AppleTV and Roku.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Game is fine but the control to activate things on the touch screen is VERY difficult to operate which makes for unpleasant gaming in my opinion!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Started reading this book and just could not understand all the great reviews.  Halfway through I thought okay now it is getting interesting but the ending was such a dud. In fact I had to check twice on my Kindle that I was actually at the end of the book!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Refreshing to read the it from the male point of view.  Further, he talked to me the whole time.  Loved it.  Highly recommend.
B000R34V50|5.0|I loved the teen age mutant nija turtles I remember when they first came around I watched them and this brings back memories fo eme
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|We loved everything about the movie!! Hulk's peformance was funny as heck.  Can't wait to see the next one!! This is a must see movie.
B0007D5GBS|5.0|This movie is a must for all Mahler fans, of which I am one.  Not only is the film unique in its portrayal of Mahler and his music, but it gives insight into Alma's role in his life. I've read several books about Mahler, but none of them clearly paint a picture of Alma and her influence on Gustav's music.. Mahler died prematurely after his short stay in the United States and the movie dramatizes his last days in Germany when he was unaware of the few weeks that he had left. Robert Powell is a perfect Mahler and I highly recommend this film.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate the look and feel of this update.  It looks cheap and flashy.  I don't like the fact that the app now automatically starts up (and burns battery time), and that you can't stop it from popping up notifications.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|The books was pretty good, however, I tired of it being narrated by the child.  I would have like a little more excitement.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is the orientation. This game insists on being played in landscape with the Kindle speakers on the left. Although I can understand the desire for landscape mode, couldn't they have let it be played with the speakers on the right as well?
B001V58BUY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and was so excited when Amazon had it in makes me so happy I give it such great reviews
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Just loved the book. It was great and the story keeps you wanting more when you finish. I would recommend it to my friends
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Much the same as his earlier two books, this one has depth, scope and intrigue.  It spans generations and continents.  Hosseini writes with insight whether describing his male or female characters, youths or adults.  He has a remarkable view of humanity.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If you are considering this book it means you have finished the first three and you are yearning for more.  This book will not disappoint.  It moves quickly and is filled with unanticipated twists and turns.  I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to reading the fifth installment
B00622D3BS|4.0|I thought the movie was really good and have always been a Steve Carell fan.  I guess I now see him as Michael Scott (The Office), but the movie was a good and seeing him in a different role from The Office was not a bad thing either.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|You can take total control over you pc, no limits, what ever you want to do, yo will be able to do...
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but It's my least favorite of all the Richard Ford books that I have read.  I had a problem with the format.  I really didn't like knowing the outcome at the beginning.  That being said, it's a good read and I always enjoy Richard Ford's characters.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This is the best game I've played in ages.  It wins in so many different ways.<br /><br />The gameplay is similar to Tetris with falling pieces that you need to nest to complete a line.  You complete lines to avoid stacking up the table and losing.  But instead of different shaped Tetris pieces, these are all lines of different widths.  Sounds simple, but it isn't.<br /><br />The graphics are very visually appealing.  They did a great job with the shapes, glass textures, and colors.  Very well done.<br /><br />And most importantly, this game is solid and doesn't crash.  I get so fed up with my EA version of Tetris crashing all the time (and trying to sell me extra level-ups).<br /><br />Great game.
159514188X|2.0|I don't understand what all of the hullabaloo there apparently is about this book. First off, the cover art is god awful and practically irrelevant. There is better art in the inside of the book and even that should have been more thought out. (Tape one should have been page one and the last tape should have been the last page.) The title is also pretty bad, (my copy had 13 questions that the author answered and he said the original title was something along the lines of \\"A Baker's Dozen\\" which is much more clever).<br /><br />  While reading, I glanced at the author's name but didn't think anything of it, but I could tell that something was off with the writing of Hannah. Turns out, a man wrote the story, which usually doesn't matter but you could tell with this book.( I will give him credit though because it is his first book, and this is the reason for two stars instead of one.) She is rather poorly written and those are not the emotions of a teenage girl. She is far too collected, and cold, and calculated. There is no life (I don't want to say this since it's tasteless, but no pun intended,)in her character, she's flat; there's nothing there to keep you connected to her, and when there was something that would start to connect us to her, Clay would interrupt and I quickly grew tired of his whining and his \\"holier than thou\\" attitude.<br /><br />  The kids in her high school were highly unrealistic. Kids are not actually like that. No one would take their time to steal a paper bag of positive notes to get back at a person and someone would have reported the peeping-Tom dude! All the kids have the same personality and I'm going to stop my review here before I start smashing my head against the key board in exasperation.<br /><br />  All in all, I wanted to throw the book across the room so many times just because it was that infuriatingly dumb and unrealistic.
B0015442YU|5.0|I love the character if doctor Hannibal lecter. It was a part masterfully played by one of my favorite actors of all time. It is a great movie I would recomemend to any movie person. But it is even better when seen with its first parts red dragon and silence of the lambs. All must see movies.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Keeps watchers glued to the series. Well done both from historical and drama status.  Refreshing change from violence and crime!
B008LVCKH6|2.0|How many ways can you keep saying the same things? I hope it was meant to be funny but it just laid there and repeated itself.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I do not subscribe to Showtime, however I anxiously await each season's DVD.  This is my favorite TV series and it will be sad when it ends this year.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|This show is awesome.  It has its narrative flaws like every other show out there but if you enjoy stories of humans fighting back an alien invasion of earth gorilla warfare style that this si the show for you.  The majority of the US Military is gone. People are fighting in the streets for survival against an advanced enemy that has strange ideas for our children.  We follow a father and his boys as he teams up with other to win the day..or can they?
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This was a  pleasant surprise to me.  Quentin T. never lets us down. I decided to put this in my collection.  The story, actors, and music were great.  I have watched it many times.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It's so nice to be able to put in your fraction problem and get your answer without having to do some work to the problem first. Very simple and does the job nicely.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game keeps you busy and the kids as well. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking to a good reaction game.
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits is witty, funny and simply awesome ! A must see for anyone who loves law shows, glamour and New York City!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app I think its really great and awesome I reccommend it I loved ot really cool and interesting and fun hope you like it
B0063M22QO|5.0|I'm am addicted to MAHJONG!!!!!!!  I am going through a rough time and this game has helped me to relax and keep my sanity.  I can focus on the game to free my mind of my mother-in-law, who lives with us and has quickly progressing dementia.  I immediately feel a calm going through my body.  Thanks for the little vacations I can take such advantage of all the time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's FREE and it is a great calculator.  You can't go wrong!  Didn't think I would really use it, but I have found that I do!
B001XCWPAM|5.0|Great set of films. My husband loved these films.  Now he can share them with all of our friends and family.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My cousin started freaking out when he saw that a movie was being made of his favorite book and basically forced me to get it and promise to read it.  All in all, this is an excellent book.  The only hesitation for me is that it is in the young adult genre.  Like Hunger games, it deals with some very powerful and raw issues that are not for younger audiences without supervision and discussion from adults.  The best part of the book for me though was that unlike too many books, I did not see the ending coming and it made beautiful, perfect sense.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This was so fun to watch.  There was something happening constantly.  Wise cracking and fun bruce willis was a joy to watch.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|As usual, cruise does a great job portraying \\"jack\\", the same name as in reacher..odd as it may be..would see again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Acting is great, cinematography is great, set design is great, costumes are great. I love this show. I recommend Downton Abbey to anyone that likes period pieces.
B004Q8LDL2|5.0|Let me start out by saying, I'm a fan of Metal Gear Solid. If nothing else, this movie is THE movie to watch, if you're at all interested in the Metal Gear Solid video game franchise. It's almost like a foresight into the future of Metal Gear.<br /><br />Besides that, Harry Gregson-Williams has a perfect fitting score. It contributes to the immersion of the film and is enjoyable to listen to the soundtrack on its own.<br /><br />Ed Harris is always enjoyable, and his role in The Rock is no exception.<br /><br />Sean Connery has a slightly different character than usual, though some have said this movie could just be about Bond after being imprisoned for 30 years. How could one ask for more than that?<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is the same great character actor that he mastered during the nineties.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great nineties action film with more contentment than the usual, boring, guy action flicks from that time. There's a great, traditional &#34;action film&#34; sense of humor about it. It's a solid title and for only two bucks for this three day rental (cheapest you can find it for by the way!) you really can't go wrong.
B008XBHIEY|4.0|I was born in the 70's and have always loved JAWS!  I finally showed it to my 12 and 10 year olds.  Thought thought it was &#34;ok&#34; (hence the 4 stars).  They thouhgt it was very &#34;old&#34;!!!  haha!!

B00B7Y0206|2.0|I only downloaded this dumb app because mobile YouTube doesn't work on my kindle anymore...This app is ok the first few times like others say, but then it goes to crap very quickly. The ads are everywhere, it either pauses every few seconds, or doesn't even load at all. I would not recommend this. I'd rather wait until the real YouTube has their stuff together and fixes their mobile viewing.
B002GAR3AM|5.0|Never got to finish the season when it was actually on Showtime. I wish it was still airing. Love it

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I don't know if there was anything wrong with this movie. As far as what was right -- great characters, animation, amazing voice over (Steve Carell rocks), wittiest and funniest lines. I can just go on and on.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids love it and works good ,but sometimes gets frozen in the nabi2.for the rest is a good way to entertain my kids.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Five stars. Bravo. If you're a fan of online multiplayer war games this is a must have! Graphics, control's, are great. Multiplayer highlights but campaign is also awesome.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|mostly everything in this game is way over priced.<br />And if you pay attention the game slowly takes away your money when their are customers their.
B009PNQUXO|3.0|I noticed in all of the videos there was terrible audio lag and only showed top videos also. But other than that it is a pretty good app.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|As I have seen from gameloft often, this is another &#34;pay-to-win&#34; game it is fun and addicting but I cannot get over the push for you to spend real money
B00CVPAJ94|5.0|Movie was in good condition. Thank you for the quality product. You are a gentleman and a scholar and I appreciate it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|My friend just got me into magic and I actually like this app more than the card game.. sometimes it's all about luck and skill but mostly it is addicting and fun 5/5
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I had heard all the hype but was skeptical, However, i found it to be both Compelling and spell-binding.  The settings, the scenery, the story-lines swept me away.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This game is a rip off I am not getting any new dragons, everytime i supposedly get a \\"new\\" dragon, its the same one that i already have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game ever I just love it so much and it is exactly like the movie and even there is this part where you have to defeat vector with his robots and this game is like subway surfers if you know what that game is but it is better.  I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000BO0LKY|5.0|This is by far one of Mariah Carey's best albums. There is a lot of great, classic songs on here.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|If You Like Quentin Tarantino Movies You Will Love This Movie. Great Story And A Must See Movie!  You Won't Be Disappointed.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|Maybe a little too much of 'slow motion' cuts. But the overall climate & plot is good for this type of movie. And of course Thandie Newton!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I'm sorry to tell you, but I think the other books before this one as  much better. Sure this one is good and all, but I think all the other ones are better. I enjoyed it a lot though, it was pretty funny too. Good book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really  a great game because u have the skateboard and u can unlock different people for good prices. It's really fun and very creative and interesting at the same time!!!!!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I am a comic fan but I had never heard of this character before.  Its a great concept that shows unflinching realism in the brutal violence that comes with being a so called \\"superhero\\".  There is also one of the best dramatic scenes ever in a comic book genre movie and it is probably one of Nicolas Cage's best scenes as well.  I'd also like to add that the movie has a decent cast around it continuing to show that british actors dominate in performances of all kinds.
B005WGIJNC|5.0|It was just what he wanted, and he was willing to wait for it being shipped to him vs. paying a lot more for it at, ah hem, another store. :)  He's 10 years old and it was just challenging enough for him to enjoy taking the time needed to put it together.  Great purchase and he was really happy with it.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My son knows he could watch this on the TV with service, but is really glad to own the hard copy of it so he can pop it in his laptop, too! It arrived in good time, great shape.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Definitely not Gillian Flynn's best work. It's got good stuff, interesting, disturbing like it should be, but not her best work. Would recommend Gone Girl any time over Sharp Objects.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is a great game.fun and addictive love it.but wish that the price for the cars was not so much.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this show, which is probably why I just finished watching the first 2 seasons in only 3 days. Lots of witty comebacks, which if you loved to watch House, will make you love this show. Unfortunately, it turns a bit too much of a soap opera in season two, with several affairs with married women etc, and I'm not a fan of this. It's hard to watch &#34;Geniuses&#34; make such stupid mistakes. Otherwise, a great show.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book was interesting and has stuff going through your head. I absolutely loved it. I want to read it over and over again!
B0001ARCFA|3.0|Sounds good but does not pack the bass punch I was expecting. For more bass punch one would have to go deeper there pockets.
0140714855|5.0|Wonderful book of intelligent writing. I highly recommend this book for anyone. How could you not love Shakespeare and all his books?
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I really enjoyed the book it was well written and kept my attention! It's a good read and really tugs on your emotions
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Hands down one of the best tv shows ever.......hope eventually they will bring it back......wishful thinking right? well at least they can reboot the series
B00499NHLC|5.0|Initially somewhat skeptical and hesitant about another re-tread of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's masterpiece, but pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Cumberbatch and Freeman is perfection and the writing is very tight, engaging, and entertaining.  Almost a bit Sorkin-esque, even, with hints of the West Wing &#34;walk and talk&#34; or the staccato monologues from Newsroom.<br /><br />Cinematography is well done as well and sprucing up the storyline for the modern age adds to the charm of the series.<br /><br />Overall, a winner in every category. Must see TV.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you're not watching it, you're missing out - some of the best characters on TV. Ultimate bromance. Smart, sexy and funny. LOVE it. Thank you, Amazon Prime!
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Killing Season is a movie that thrills and leaves you thinking.  It is timely because the tension echoes many of the current situations going on in society.  In their own right each of the two in the movie have their reasons (and justifications) for their points and places.  In the end (sorry, no spoiler here) the stark realization of the view from the other side really brings home the powerful moral of this movie.  De Niro is his usual amazing self and Travolta delivers a nearly convincing eastern bloc persona.  Well worth seeing.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|I watched this movie (which I have a copy at home also and is VHS) with all of my grandchildren.  Great family movie that I would recommend to everyone, yes even boys.  Wholesome and tells a real story.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie clearly says you aren't living unless you are happy.  If your not happy, your dying.  You have to find your own Red or Andy and get to your own Zehuatanejo.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is the best one so far I've tried others and this one's the one for me I recommend it if it into this type of stuff so download it and have fun
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I chose this rating for the book because it definetly deserves it. This wise dog named Enzo has taught me copious amounts of imformation that can be applied to my world, everyone's for that matter. I loved everything about it, although the extensive parts of racing talk lost me. I recommend this for everyone, old and young. This is a very good read.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This is one of the best worship c.d. I have heard in a long time. The c.d. Has multiple worship artist on it from Israel houton to Kari jobe. Don't hesitate to purchase this one.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Great love story. I love the way Nicholas Sparks helps you relate to the characters and shows deep meaning behind the story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't like this game I love it if u don't have this hurry and get it.if I could I would marry this game
B000FC0P9E|5.0|Yes I would defiantly say this was a good novel and would also it and excellent read. My cousin had read it and said I much too. will probably reread it again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There is nothing as delightful as watching people struggle with change and relationships, and to try and do it ethically is totally missing in now a day shows. Now a days it is me me me and you are just stuck. Here there is at least an ethics as you watch drama unfold. Bad guys are not always bad guys they are struggling with their needs. Same thing good guys are not always good guys but struggle. A wonderful glimpse of the times doing an excellent job characters, plot and scenery. Love it!
B000VZD8TO|5.0|This is a book that you'll read over and and over.  I am so glad i found it and i recommend to all believers.
B008Y76VW2|1.0|If I was not just killing time and thought that because of some of the reviews this would actually work out as something miraculous, I would have never watched it to the end. Just a bunch of me me me's pointing out that those with ethics don't always have their dreams come true so they are going to fiddle away time at what ever pleases them.
B005VPRG10|5.0|My grandson couldn't find this set anywhere and i was very happy to see it online.  He put it together with his family and enjoyed every minute of it.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|I was excited to watch this film.<br />It was a complete let down<br />Turned it off after 30 minutes.<br />Although I laughed at a couple spots it was not worth my time
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I've loved the Alien franchise ever since I was obsessed with James Cameron's sequel as a kid. I remember I wasn't even old enough to see the movie yet, but I bought the old-school behind-the-scenes picture book and poured over it day and night. We all piled into the living room to watch Ridley Scott's original on VHS and I dropped a stuffed animal on my little sisters head during the scene when the facehugger drops on Ripley... Scared the crap out of her!<br /><br />Watching the series again on Blu Ray was like watching them again for the first time. The picture is as sharp as it could possibly be, the presentation is flawless. They even cleaned up the Extended Cut of Alien 3, WITH THE RIGHT ENDING! None of that popping out at the last minute crap.<br /><br />This was a steal at $20 and one of the best Blu Rays I've put in my collection. Awesome job!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing the game.  Easy to use. Not too many ads.  Different choices for dealing. Definitely would recommend getting.
B000I8ERVC|5.0|My parents explained that hippies and others who opposed wars and greed were beaten, killed and otherwise harmed during the 60's. I look around today and see how environmental and anti-war protesters are treated by the police and the surveillance state, and it's still the same. And the rednecks never go away. They just get bigger guns.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|One of the best films of 2013, this new collaboration between Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarry deserves more attention and respect than it got. I give it five stars just for the riveting, stunningly photographed opening sequence and Joe Kramer's terrific score. And a creepy cameo from Werner Herzog doesn't hurt a bit!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I usually can't get enough of sappy Nicholas Sparks movies based in some sleep little town in North Carolina or the like, and this one was great...until the really strange twist ending that left me googling the movie because I didn't even GET it; was I supposed to believe that ending? Credits rolled, and I was just, &#34;What?!&#34;<br /><br />In any case, Josh Duhamel is a smokin' hottie and that's basically enough reason to watch, regardless of the supremely dumb ending.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I am not into other songs sung by artists.  I like hearing originals from MB.  I am sure many of you would understand this.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Funny, cute, sad, romantic. It was everything I needed in the movie. The actors did an amazing job as well. This is a new favorite for me.
B0091QSNEE|3.0|It involves making cake, gingerbread men and other foods.  My 5 year old daughter really likes it. My 7 year old son likes it too.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|I don't expect much from Hollywood these days, but MUD really and truly surprised me. Well acted by all, immersive, touching, and gripping at moments. A story of trust, friendship, commitment, and love. Can't recommend it enough. This is a good one.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|Love the game.  Already rated it once but then i had to download the paid version to get more levels to play.
B000TDG9D0|5.0|i really enjoyed listening to the soulful sounds from a beautiful gifted and talented singer. I recomend this artist to anyone who wants to experience music.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I ordered a used copy of Julia Child's book, and gave the cookbook and movie as a Christmas gift.  My daughter (age 40) loved the gift and the whole family watched the movie together that very night with several other visiting nieces and nephews and they all loved it even the younger ones that I thought would be off playing...they came in and sat through the whole movie and loved it too.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Fantastically well written historical account that offers a plausible theoretical account for a vexing politico-economic problem.  Read blend of political science with solid history.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I liked it, as some others have said..not as good as the first.  The plot kind of seemed out of whack.  But entertainment value wise it was worth a rent.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I saw this reviewed by Wil Wheaton and friends on tabletop games (YouTube). This is a very fast-play game, fun, and a lot of laughs. It's a quick game for when you are wanting to do something but no on can make up their minds what to do. Just get this game out.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this book several times in my life, and I never get tired of it.  Jane Austen brought to life a family that is as endearing, exasperating, and at times humorous as any real family.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I saw an interview with the author on The Daily Show, and decided to check out this book. This book is a historical biography, not a biblical supplement. It is quite a fascinating read. Although I am only half way through it, I am really enjoying this, and I am not a religious person.
0374533652|4.0|I thought the book was a little thin... emphasizing only the inequality and corruption implications of placing everything for sale.  What about community, place, etc.?  I thought the examples were the best part.
1439152802|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I took 8 hours and read it straight through.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Honestly with an all star cast I expected a bit more from this movie - for $3 it was OK however I will not be paying any more than that to see the next one!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I've read all three books I now feel I too can be a author. Dominate aka emotional and at times verbal abuse I was just waiting for the moment where he punched her with that being said I grasp the concept it was just poorly put across. Something nice it is addictive in a crazy sort of way so I guess mission accomplished lol
0307591549|5.0|I have not read the book but I know I will enjoy it. The book arrived on time and in good shape. It's a used book but it looks like new.
1594746036|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it in only a couple of days.  Very different, well written, full of suspense.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I got these because while I LOVE the new movies, I had a strong sense of nostalgia for the old ones of my youth.  I grew up on the old Star Trek movies.  It would have been nice if the special features included the bloopers, but this is really a good price for what you get.
0451228731|5.0|I've also read part 2, Freedom. Suarez is a skilled writer with a strong technological background. He is able to weave his knowledge into a fast-paced, thought-provoking, and incredibly entertaining thriller/adventure. His story and his writing are riveting. Really makes you think deeply about the direction our present techno world is heading - and we're stuck for the ride whether we like it or not.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|thank you amazon for always having the books I look for. this was an amazing book. I do believe there is a heaven. I'd recommend this book to everyone who's just curious.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is the best show that has been on TV is years, Sheldon Cooper, played by Jim Parsons is the funniest character on TV since the Three Stooges. The shows writing is always original and they have come up with so many extremely funny scenarios they put the cast in, that I laugh constantly watching every episode. The entire cast is awesome, but Sheldon is the highlight of the show. It's really funny watching Sheldon evolve into a human being, and learning to deal with other people.  When Sheldon laughs in his unique way, it makes me laugh. The Big Bang Theory is a great show to watch to forget your  everyday problems.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|This movie made a big hit with my grandson. He loves lego movies and has been wanting the Batman movie.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|The movie was great if you're a fan of the '80 '90 where action was all there was without much stupid drama and sex in between. Let's say more like without pointless sex ruining the absurd levels of action. The mixture of actors is great even if character development isn't as great as in the first and the amount of cliches is quite high the movie got it's own magic is entertaining and worth watching. Is not a serious plot movie or a OMG THAT STORY or anything, is a reunion with old actors brought together into the big screen for your enjoyment with many many jokes in between, specially jokes about themselves and the way people see them. I personally recommend this film!
B0036TGT02|5.0|Guys,<br />I,m writing this review for the benefit of all American fans of The Jungle Book,I understand it,s being released,on blu-ray,on February 2014 in America.<br />Well,it,s just been released,on blu-ray,here in Scotland,U.K.four days ago,I bought it today,so if anyone is interested in \\"the blu-ray review\\" here we go.<br />It,s been quite a while since I viewed it,on dvd,watching it on the blu-ray format was a PLEASURE,the picture quality is EXCELLENT,sharp as a tack,BEAUTIFUL!!!!the sound quality is TREMENDOUS,it,s like hearing it for the \\"first time\\"!!!!!<br />I aint gonna review the Film itself,EVERYBODY knows the storyline,it,s a CLASSIC,in anybodys language,possibly Disney,s BEST!!!!<br />Now,something that is very unusual,the U.K. coming out with the blu-ray BEFORE America???? this is possibly a FIRST,reason being? not a clue!!!!<br />America has 6/7 months to wait for The Jungle Book blu-ray,trust me Guys,it,s well worth the wait,an absolutely MUST-BUY!!!!!!!!<br />I,ve read a few of the discussions about The Jungle Book being filmed at a 4.3 aspect,and a lot of guys saying that the widescreen version is cropped,on either I dont know which is correct,all I do know is this blu-ray widescreen version is SUPERB!!!!!!<br />Davy Cairns,Scotland.<br />ps,The Jungle Book blu-ray,U.K., is listed as Region B/C,absolutely no mention of Region Free,or Region A,if thats any help to someone who might be possibly thinking of buying the U.K. blu-ray,I repeat,no mention of Region Free,or A.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Great movie at a great price.  Got one for each of the grandchildren.  Love the combo pack as there are Blue Ray and dvds in the house.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|This book is a must for business owners and all who want to see the world a better place. Loved it!
B000MR1V22|5.0|This is just a great little gem of a movie, with wonderful performances by Steve Carrell and Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin. Sweet with just the right amount of edge.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I've never read the book, but I thought writers did a great job with this film. They focused more on the plot and action in the film, rather than the odd love story, which made it better than I expected. I do think other films have handled this kind of story better, but I enjoyed the twist of having the alien empathize with humans. Not an amazing film, but worth watching.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Never read Gaiman before and I was ready to finish the book so I could move on to something more intriguing!  It did not seem like an adult novel to me.
0385504225|5.0|Here are my two reasons for reading Dan Brown's  \\"The Lost Symbol\\":<br />1) I really enjoyed \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"<br />2) The many negative reviews at Amazon.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much. After reading the book, my attitude is in stark contrast to those who wrote the negative reviews. Here is how I analyse a novel: Does it allow me to escape into the world it has created, allowing me to exit my reality. Also, when interrupted while reading, does it beckon me to continue reading and postpone the routine, mundane tasks, work, errands, etc. that  I \\"should\\" be doing. This book did the trick. I enjoyed it very much, staying up late on a work night to complete it!<br /><br />Dr. Stanley E. Toompas, Optometrist<br />& Author of \\"I'm the One the Other Isn't\\"
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|this is a really fun game with lots of challenges. It could use a few more levels. Super glad I got it for free.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Fun,  easy read.  I liked Tina fey before, and I like her even more after reading her book.  She is hilarious!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Marvellous and known for years of its quality as an adventurous Novel. A very good book for reading light heartedly.
B004499KJU|5.0|I love this keychain!  The only hazard I've found is that the mouse unscrews quite easily during routine use.  I've made it a habit to check it every day to make sure it has not come loose.  On a few days it was close to coming apart completely.  Other than that it's a great keychain--it's easy to change keys, and I love the sleek yet playful style.
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|Uninstallrding To The Info,THey Test Access Tools To Access Protected Data. Why?<br /><br />It Is A Full Version App No Need To Test On My Days.<br /><br />Unusual
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Another Camel Club book I could hardly put down. Great twists and turns in the plot. Would recommend to any who enjoy mystery, political intrigue, thrillers, and those like me who enjoy strong characters like Oliver Stone and his friends brought together again. I hope David Baldacci well being then back again soon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app and its accompanying movies. I give this 5 stars because it rocks to the moon and back. It also is a great free alternative to all those movie themed temple run games.
B002SGYPS2|5.0|Jim Carey is a genius. Great direction and a compelling story. A funny and thoughtful film that we still talk about.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I dont know why i waited so long to watch this movie honestly. its now listed in my top 5 favourites - clint eastwood is an amazing actor and this film has a good message about racism in this country.
1432794426|5.0|This has to be without doubt the best book that I have read about Michael Jackson.  For so many years he was subjected to lies, hate and media spin that he openly admitted hurt him and which he despised.  Karen Moriarty has taken the time to go into detail with FACTS and not fabricated lies like so many other authors who claim to be the fountain of all knowledge when it comes to Michael.  I intend to read this book again.  I found it hard to put it down once I started.  All credit to the author on this amazing book.  What a pity that there are so many other books out there who's authors are only using Michael as a meal ticket, even after his death.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|this movie is pretty fantastic! the director tarantino has done it again! grusome gore with a comical side, my kind of flick ;)
B0061S073A|4.0|i DL this app for my 5 year old i like all the options and such but i have the pin lock on and just like that he  exited it back to the main menu within seconds while i looked away he had no idea what was going on and was like MOM!!! hopefully that doesn't happen to often my sole purpose for buying this wasn't for worry of what he might watch or play but so he cant make purchases from marketplace with out my approval or on accident .... we shall see
B00B78AIV0|5.0|Chimamanda Adichie is a favorite of my niece and she highly recommended her novels.  I'm glad she did because I loved Purple Hibiscus and plan to read Half a Yellow Sun next.  And....I'm on the waiting list for Americanah!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I see it every time it comes on TV, so why not buy it so I could watch it throughout the year anytime I want to get that wonderful feeling. It gets better with time
1586638491|5.0|I'm enjoying the No Fear Shakespeare version of The Tempest so much that I just got their A Companion[[ASIN:1411497465 No Fear Shakespeare: A Companion (No Fear Shakespeare)]] along with The Merchant of Venice.  The left page is the original play and the right page is a modern, easy-to-read translation.  I'm getting a lot more nuances this way.  I should add that I'm not new to Shakespeare either, having read 8 plays in high school and college, plus several productions and movies of those and others.  I also took History of Drama I & II,  and read plays from ancient Greek all the way to Theater of the Absurd.  Highly recommend this series!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while.  It weaves an engaging portrait of a top New York law firm with Harvey, a maverick risk-taking lawyer who lets a brilliant kid, Mike Ross without a law degree into an All-Harvard graduated shop.  We follow them through the twists and turns of their careers as Mike learns to navigate the thrilling, often treacherous and confusing landscape of standing up for truth and justice while also living with the golden rule of the lawyer: Always Win.
B0019I6WDG|4.0|It had it's sad parts and happy part. The part about the older man falling for the girl was a bit creepy though. ;D<br />Still the movie was touching and it had that weird vibe about it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is fun but i dont like how other peoole can just get on your world and destroy everything. If the app had a passcode to get in the worlds it would be a 10 hands down.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|It was a sweet love story.<br />A gripping and even at times thrilling action film.<br />Even moments of humor.<br />It started off a little slow but it sure picked up in no time and I enjoyed the movie.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is super fun! This game is not only fun but educational. I love creating different outcomes each time. Wish life was like scribblenauts!
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Of course I am a huge fan of xmen so perhaps my rating could be a little biased.<br />I love the action, adore all the actors and think the movie was a wonderful introduction to the older characters we know and love.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this game, thinking it would be fun and immersive, but it bogged down in downloading files needed to play the game (after already downloading the app).  When it took nearly 30 minutes to get 3% of content downloaded, I opted to uninstall the app.  I never got to play the game and told friends not to bother with it, either.  Don't bother getting this app.
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|The cutting off of the arm scene was sure intense. But other then that it was slow and rather uneventful, which I suppose is all you can expect when the whole movie is about him being stuck under a rock.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|Yep, that couple from SPEED is back. This time Sandra Bullock plays a doctor and Keanu Reeves is an architect. Christopher Plummer is great as Reeves' father who never understood him. This is one to watch again and again.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|this is a excellent movie and I recommend the movie highly.  watch the movie on blue ray for the best enjoyment
B0060D0R2C|5.0|The story, the action, the actors, and the cinematography are all excellent! I've seen this many times and have bought three copies (1st DVD got stuck in an old player, sister kept replacement, and now have a copy in my Amazon Instant Video library). Mazy Gray is superb performing some of the background music and the end titles theme 'Comin' Back To You.'
B0089EHWQE|5.0|this book was probably one of the best ive ever read. it was addicting from the first page...i didnt want to sleep i just wanted to stay home all day and night and read
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|The central premise is a really cool idea.  Debra and Dexter are well-developed.  Nemesis and adversaries leave something to be desired.  Characters that have been on the show for years and get lots of screen time - La Guerta, Batista, Quinn, Jaime, Matthews, Astor, Cody - are not quite Star Trek red shirts, but they really could be more complicated, more engaging, and more dynamic.  The writing invests a lot of time and energy into some sub-plots that conclude in  anti-climactic, convoluted ways.  How often are we going to re-use the plot lines \\"law enforcement gets too close to the truth about Dexter\\" (Dokes, Lundy, Prado, and two or three in Season 7) and \\"romance complicates Dexter's life\\" (Rita, Lila, Lumen, again once or twice in this season).  The show has such a strong skeleton, some quick reflexes, and some artful style (opening credits) - it could do so much more with fewer characters and fewer sub-plots.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I love it when the bad guys get their just desserts in the end. Personally, I am over 60, so I can relate.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I'd been told I had to watch this show by people years ago, wish I'd listened sooner. They form such a great communal bond, I want more! At this point I'm going to download the Dark Horse comics that Joss Whedon wrote.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Tried on 2 separate devices, iPhone 3gs and kindle fire, both have glitch on level 5; can't select 2nd key. Very disappointing as the game was fun and challenging.
B004G0SJU8|3.0|However, the execution of the acting was somewhat lacking.  I believe it was the direction given.<br />The accident scene was ????
B00138EV8U|5.0|Brings back great memories for me of several eras and styles of music and film. Highly recommended for fans of the 80's.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|This series will keep you guessing right up to the end. I am fortunate to have British friends who give me my fixes in advance, but I will def be purchasing and rewatching this one as it comes out in US. The entire series is an edge of your seat wonder of a drama. This is my second time around and I'm still crying my eyes out. Great writing. Great Acting. One of the best things I've watched in a while. The killer will be the last person you'd suspect.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is what novels hope to be when transformed for film. The writing is superb and in almost every case the acting matches it.<br />Anyone else notice that the best television is coming out of the UK?
B0090O07S2|5.0|Well worth the price and great restoration of July 1968 concert by the Doors! EXCELLENT! Any fan of the band will love this as a gift.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|I heard this was a good movie and I was told to watch some other movies first in a specific sequence in order to best appreciate this one. So, I followed what was said to me.  Regardless, this film was not exciting and not memorable.  As I believe that I am a fair person, I will try to watch it again.  Perhaps I was in an unreceptive state of mind or perhaps I am correct and that this was just Hollywood yet again diluting great comic book characters and stories, so that they fit into some formula that executives can stomach and sell to achieve short term monetary goals.<br /><br />Note that I especially enjoy *great* action, sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure films.  This mediocre effort was not one of them.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This is a very well written and many layered story.  It has so many levels of interest beyond just the story line.  Not too many things written on this level.  A little over the top at times (Charles), but still intriguing.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|It's been a while since they re-released those butchered versions of the first few albums.  Gosh I hope those executives and engineers that did that are some place where they can no longer damage great music.<br /><br />This fixes everything!  To paraphrase Billy Gibbons, &#34;its the way albums were mean to be heard&#34;.  He's right. These recordings appear to be on the money.  Absolutely no complaints.  Its also great to have the entire collection in a single set.  In this way, you really get to appreciate the great music ZZ Top have made throughout their career. Sit back and dig some nice Texas, snarling blues.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Good graphics and good environment but like most of these apps it forces you to buy a lot of peanuts to get the best stuff.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|The characters were very interesting and gave me a glimpse into English life in the 19th century, I highly recommend it.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Wedding Night is a fun and fast read. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I loved the intertwined stories and the characters.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I am really enjoying it If you like Bob Seger you will love this one I have it in my car and listen to it all the time
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's fun I can play for hours but you need hearts to play on. But can get help for friends on th.
B005HSL626|3.0|Not really much to say.  It is a free game.  Not an addinctive game, gets kind of boring after a few minutes.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|have used various pdf readers in the past as well as other versions of Repligo, their latest is the best so far!
B001L51RQE|4.0|I love this DVD, the concert is fantastic. I've waited years to see a Police reununion concert. I was afraid to buy the Synchronicity DVD because it's old and might be like Hendrix DVD's that sound like someone stuck a mic up in the crowd and recorded it. The audio is great and you can hear each instrument very clearly.<br />There are times when I thought Andy's guitar could have been a bit louder, but overall this was not an issue. The crowd are pretty soft and don't distract from the show. I don't think there was much crowd noise recorded.<br />I loved the song selection. It was like listening to Police's greatest hits. I found myself singing along to just about every song.<br /><br />My edition had live CD with it as well. It would have got 5 stars if it had included a Documentary on the DVD instead of directing to website content that expired in 2009.
B000WT5IUQ|5.0|I love Christmas! I love the Carpenters! Can it get any better? NO!!! This is a great find and if you're like me you'll love it too!
B00009TB5G|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan of Lord of the Rings. So for her birthday we bought her the extended version. I have watched them with her and I really like watching the shows it makes more sense.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I've been flying on a rooted Nook Color with CM10.  Although it doesn't have the horsepower of a newer tablet, with a few adjustments to detail, this flies pretty well.  The missions are fun and challenging.  I've enjoyed reattempting them all with the different aircraft.  Even the slower ones as they respond differently than the faster ones; just because you can drift the sports car doesn't mean you are good at driving the bus!  Inflight refueling seems to always be a challenge.  Runs under radar will drive you nuts sometimes.  Touch and go is fun, especially if you figure out how to hack it.  Recent app upgrades have added even more realism and details.  One thing I enjoy doing at times is to light up the afterburners and do some flybys of the tower, then go back and replay while patting myself on the back for successfully barrel rolling across the deck!  (If only we could see the air boss spill his coffee!)  In general, what's really nice about this is that you can enjoy something with a good amount of realism w/o much effort.  Controls can be set to simple or more advanced.  And no, it's not FSX of course, but it doesn't require a water cooled rig either.  If you have 5 minutes of downtime, you have a mission in your hands.  Flight time on the go is good!
B001LF347E|5.0|This is a great series and my family love watching it. Merlin is a quite servent that acts like he is ordinary but he is truly a wizard. You will love it.
1781162646|5.0|Great book.. as always with Stephen King. Highly recommend to anyone. I loved it and actually bought another one as a gift for a friend..
B00CA4S27W|5.0|My daughter and myself really love Blackmore's Night and have all their albums. Of all the albums this one is the best so far. We bought the cd that has a dvd with it. It was really fun to watch Ritchie and Candice perform and talk about the album.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a simple app with slick interface and very effective. Will be helpful if you can also integrate A task switcher along with this
B00991TCOG|5.0|So my daughter introduced me to her music from watching youtube. And for her birthday we bought her this cd. It is so wonderful to listen to. Lindsey is so talented and amazing on the violin. This is a must have cd.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun.<br />Its a workout for your brain.  I would recommend this game for anyone that likes to think or work out problems.
B002GHHHIS|5.0|This movie is so much fun to watch. It is the best of Sylverster Stallone and Kurt Russell. This is a wonderfully funny and action adventure show you will see in a long time.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Some scenes are cheesy but overall always a good story .  Gets better with later episodes. Why do I need to type anymore?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I enjoy this almost as much as I do the pc version.  there are a few things I wish it had...but it is still playable & enjoyable.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Well alrighty then. Here's your 20 words. Amazon.com > manage my kindle > refund > UNWANTED PURCHASE. You're welcome.<br /><br />In all seriousness, the flat and simple plot, horrible grammar, and complete genre ignorance is astounding. Its actually insulting. Rice owes ME 2.99, for wasting my time. Yours too. Click it.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|this was the best science fiction television show ever. they should bring it back in tv or movies soon!!!!! even better than dr who
0786956291|5.0|Came exactly as expected! Good price and quick shipping
B006R6ZP6U|5.0|I like this movie, it doesn't have to much fairytale.  I like the fact that it has a dark side to it like it is supposed to have, after all the Grimm brothers didn't writer little love stories that always ended with &#34;Happily Ever After&#34;.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|In spite of the main theme, I could not put this book down.  Who to blame?  Anyone or everyone?  The father in particular was the most upsetting character. Passivity kills.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games out  of all of them.plus I have 124games I hope this game never ends !!!!!!!!!!<br />But I wish that you could sell keys for coins but owe well
B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|Well written as usual by this author.  It is a heart wrenching story on so many levels.  Thought the ending was too unfinished, as though he just wanted to quickly stop writing.  Over all, a very good book.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I liked this game, but I can not complete the last chapter. I would like to play it again. This is the same with magic academy 1. What is up with this?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another very well written and carefully nuanced book from Hosseini.  His characters are always well defined and find a place in my heart and the memories of them linger after finishing the book.
145211207X|5.0|If you like Art, if you like character creations, if you are a color lover, you must have this wonderful book.<br /><br />Beautiful process and inspiration.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I love this show..never a dull moment. Can't wait for the next season to come out..Can't wait to see what they come up with next
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A few rare texts linger with you and change the way you see the world. This optimistic story is worth the relatively small investment in time to reap the benefits. Recommend
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is an awesome book!!!! Definitely worth 5 stars, it's one of the best books ever! Can't wait to get the next book in the series! =)
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Not for kids, my grand daughter is 4 and is very computer savy...game was way to hard and complicated for her.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun entertaining game. Enjoyed playing this. It is awesome. Anyone can have a fun time on this game. I highly suggest this game.
B007HO392S|5.0|Great cd, love the fact that I have the cd coming in the mail , but can download and put it on my mp3 player the same day. Don't have to wait for cd to come in the mail put it on my computer and transfer it to my player. Great idea...no extra charge...will be ordering more cd from amazon .Be came a favorite 1st time I listened to it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game that only costs &cent;99/99 Amazon app coins. This game so far features 15 boxes, and they're going to be adding more free updates In a little bit more time of development. The point of this skill-game is to cut ropes with precise timing, feed Om Nom candy =) and figure out how to get all stars in the level. There are 3 seasons, each has 5 boxes. Per box, there are 25 levels. In all, there are 375 levels and 1,125 stars to collect. This may change since this review is from August Tenth, 2013 (8/10/13). You can even double check with a calculator =) . Feed Om Nom, candy. Cut ropes at precise times. Get all the stars you possibly can. Have fun and enjoy. Thank you for a great app, ZeptoLab, and thank you Amazon for putting this app in the app store.<br /><br />Get this app, you won't regret it.
1451626096|4.0|I was a little concerned when I began this fifth book in the Cousins' War series because I had not read any of the previous books. However, Gregory's writing style sucked me right into this story of Princess Elizabeth of York who was the lover of her uncle Richard III and the bride of Henry Tudor. I was drawn into the worldview of this young woman who knew from the beginning that she was a pawn to be played out as those in power wanted.<br /><br />Elizabeth was torn between her mother who was constantly scheming to bring a York prince to power and her new loyalty to her Tudor husband and her own Tudor children. While I didn't at all like Henry Tudor who was suspicious and paranoid, I could understand how he came to be that way. He seemed to think of himself as a usurper and surrounded by enemies (and his actions acted as a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy as he created even more enemies due to his suspicions and harsh penalties). Elizabeth tried to guide him to be a better king but couldn't overcome the influence of his mother.<br /><br />Henry's obsession with eliminating any York heir to the throne dominated the book. While Elizabeth's brothers Edward and Richard were assumed to have died in the Tower, no bodies were found and the pretenders were constant. Adding to the confusion, Elizabeth's mother might have been able to smuggle her younger son Richard out of the Tower and send him to safety making the possibility of a real York prince a reality. Elizabeth is torn between her vows to Henry and her heart's desire to have her younger brother be alive.<br /><br />The writing was exquisite and the story was compelling. I couldn't stop reading. Fans of historical fiction are right to have made Philippa Gregory's books so popular. This won't be the last that I read.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|If you watched the series as a kid way back when like I did (yes, I'm dating myself), it's fun to see it again.  Sure, it doesn't have all the fancy effects they use in movies these days, but it's still great entertainment.  The characters gain a little more personality each episode... Spock becomes more &#34;Spockish&#34; for instance... and it's neat to watch the development.  Grab a bowl of popcorn and spend an enjoyable evening back in the &#34;old days&#34; of Star Trek.
B00CRMWMZ0|1.0|The world is very different since the robotic uprising of 2005. There is no more originality. We no longer say yes. Instead we say \\"affirmative.\\" There is only one kind of dance. The robot. And the robo boogie. Ah, yes, two kinds of dances. Finally, robotic beings rule the universe. The humans are dead.<br /><br />Can we just talk to the humans a little while longer? It could make things better.<br /><br />No. Because they are dead.<br /><br />The humans are dead. Once again, without emotion. Daft Punk are dead. They appealed to the masses, but crawled up their own asses. Daft Punk are dead.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Taubes gives the technical explanation for my life long struggle with weight and the variety of diets I have tried over a life time.
B008KE3960|1.0|If I had written this review 6 months ago, even a few weeks ago, it might have been 5 stars.  However, I have been forced to remove the game from my Kindle Fire due to memory issues.  Every time I played the game, I got a memory low error, and it jumped me to removing applications.  Every single time I went to that list, the size of Air Patriots had increased.  When I finally removed the game, it was over 600Mb!  Just a tad bit over the \\"77.5Mb\\" that they claim, eh?  It took me a while to realize this was happening, I was originally removing old games or other apps I no longer wanted.  But, every time I removed an app, Air Patriots grew to take up the space I had just vacated.  And there was no easy or obvious method to report the bug/issue, which is seriously frustrating.<br /><br />Quite a shame, it was a fun game.  When it wasn't killing my Fire, that is.
B00CRMWMZ0|1.0|I liked the song I heard on StePhest Colbchellaa song despite this band's lack of commitment to the Steve Colbert Show that they agreed to perform at.  Yes, MTV & the VMA's are important to artist's.  More important are your fans & potential fans.  I loved watching Steve, Jeff Bridges, Hugh Laurie, Matt Damon, Breaking Bad cast, Jimmy Fallon & Henry Kissinger's participation.<br />The group is now regulated  to my you tube list of watchable only.  I don't I'll ever purchase their music to show my lack of support for their behavior.<br />Steve You Rock!
B009EELBIS|5.0|Love this Movie, One of the Greatest Musicals of all time!  I would recommend it to anyone as a must see.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Action packed and full of stars.  Recommended to anyone who likes action movies.  Keeps your attention and even has a story line.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Let's see, bad script, marginal acting, fair filming...idea had potential but...I would put this one in the bored with all other movies before I saw this one list.
B00068TJM6|4.0|Excellent present for someone u care.  The date window is too small, and the alarm is barely audible. Otherwise a great watch!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! It's really fun, but challenging at the same time :) it's great for people who love despicable me
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Guess I'm one of the few people who didn't and doesn't care for the original. If it hadn't been for my 2 year old daughter, well, I wouldn't have revisited it (somehow her mother is to blame BUT a happy wife is a happy life or so some would say) That being typed, loved Sam's version. This isn't a remake or retooling with all the singin and dancin, it's Sam Raimi with his up close camera now back now sideways now front camera angles. It's Evil Dead w/o the \\"I'll swallow your soulllllllll.\\" Don't feel cheated or slighted because extras and a 2D version weren't included. Was glad to read a sequel was in order although Sam may not be associated with it. Oh please don't let there be any singing... I could have easily set out on a course to describe in boring and yawning detail about the 3D but it's something some folks should experience in the home for themselves. Some are subtle and some are \\"oh neat that was cool\\" specifically the plant like thingy's. For me it's way up there on the 3D must see movies. Then again I also like(d) Showgirls and not because of the nudity so your eye mileage may vary...
B008Y768XO|5.0|Never cried so much !! So,so sad , but still such a great movie . I've lent it to anyone and everyone . This was the second copy I've bought, as it was a gift for a good friend who used to live in Japan and knew the story of Hachiko . Strongly recommend to any animal lover.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Don't like it because I don't have a Facebook and my mom nor my dad will let me use there's so there for.I cannot play and there is no other log in option but Facebook thanks gameloft for makeing me download a pointless app &gt;:(
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Writing is that of a high schooler.  Sex scenes amusing but uninspired.  Perfect for the vanilla housewife who needs to add some spice to her already dull and submissive life.  For those of us who don't live vanilla it was very meh.
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|Well, I keep reading that people are losing from 4 to 20 pounds in a week.  I am not!!  In fact, last week, I gained 2 pounds.  I would like to take it for another month but if I do not start losing weight, I will not spend more money on the product.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|This is very different from what I am used to reading but it's a very easy read.  I highly recommend it
B008XG1X18|4.0|Especially great for recipes and fun decorating ideas, it's addicting. Also love seeing everyone else's ideas and posts. Great app!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought this as an anniversary present for my wife.  One of the best presents I have ever bought her.  These guys are extremely talented artists, and I would recommend this album to anyone.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the interplay between the characters as well as the<br />cases presented.  Very engaging!  Would recommend to<br />anyone who likes The Good Wife.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Great entertainment, good science fiction story and acted well we enjoyed it very much, it was nice to have a movie that did not have a lot of swearing, and the romantic scenes were done tastefully.
1603427244|5.0|I love it! Some of the methods I knew already, but most of them were new to me. I have already tried two ways. This is a great little to carry along to knit club. Also, I was not aware of the many ways to bind.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|It's okay. I  just wished I had known it is a series of books.  I would like to read them in order.
B004R0WKNE|5.0|I wouldn't usually give a broad formula-type comedy 5 stars: but when that movie comes with a cute storyline and great acting it feels okay to give praise. This is a movie that makes you smile, and unlike most \\"rom-coms\\" (if you would call it that) men will enjoy this as well. The cast is phenomenal, with Harrison Ford and Rachel McAdams being the perfect counterparts of grouchy and bubbly. I especially loved seeing Ford in this movie, as you don't see him in too many comedies. But in this movie I'm reminded how great his comedic timing is. And though she has a small role, Diane Keaton is also hilarious to watch. Overall, a great movie to watch when you want to unwind and laugh.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I  have read all three books in the series in print form.  I bought this for my Kindle so my wife could read it, and I could reread it, before seeing the movies.
B00C55EW7K|5.0|Cant' go wrong with this one. From top to bottom and back to front  really good record A+ A+A+ A+ A+
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun and simple! Galaxy note 2 no problem. I like how you can choose the controls from tilt or touch screen.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Good production quality, superb acting, and believably written. Cumberbatch is top-notch portraying the  tortured soul who cannot deny his intellect just to fit in with the rest of the world.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|I was pleased! It was brighter than I expected, although a little blinding when the bulbs were at eye level. The multiple settings are nice to have and the built in hook on the bottom was great for hanging it in the tent.<br />I thought it was a good value.
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|Very few things that any normal tourist is likely to be able to see or do. Only 2 stars because it was inexpensive.
0790729369|5.0|this is one of the best Meryl Streep movies and clint eastwood is such a good actor.this story is so heartwarming and it really draws you into the story....I will be watching this movie over and over it is such a good movie.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Les Miserables is a fantastic movie from start to finish. Not much more needs to be said...watch it yourself and see!
0792846443|5.0|this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.It has a great story line and makes you wonder.
B00DW3GDQW|5.0|Very well acted. Easy to follow. Epic...really epic...finale. It makes history fun to learn.  I don't like history movies.  But Tora Tora Tora is 15x better than Pearl Harbor.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|this movie will make you cry and make you laugh. Tom Cruise and Dustan Hoffman are the ones that make this movie so good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love Downton Abbey for all kinds of reasons... Beautiful costumes and setting, smart dialog ( I use sub titles as not to miss anything due to thick accents) and wonderful characters!! Rewatched S3... ran out on the finale... Unhappy with Matthew for leaving the show!!!!
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Why do I care if I have this app if I can't get Candy Crush the game on my Kindle!!!!
B004PAHZMC|5.0|like anything that helps minimize clutter of kids toys, a little small though, would have liked it to be about 50% bigger
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this show.  It gets better and better each season!!!  So addictive...I watched all three seasons back to back.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Fairly true to the book. Enjoyable movie overall but a bit rushed at times.  Streamed well, looked good, and sounded good.
B005CWRB44|3.0|Perfect for my wife's handbag or key chain. My only negative comment is on the cost of the battery. At a national drug store chain I paid nearly $11.00 for one battery. Checkout various prices online for a better deal on batteries.
0761169253|5.0|This book will surely get you ready for a personal \\"remix\\". From page 1, Kleon's book delivers countless thought provoking anecdotes that are instantaneously regenerative. It's a great read that can be achieved within a couple hours, however, what you get from it is probably more beneficial than a 1000 page self help book. I've personally found myself imprisoned by the illusionary theory of originality in art. Not to say that an artist's work can't be original...it can, in the sense of uniqueness, but as with everything in life, that work has it's own origins. Overall, Kleon uses his own life experience and the wisdom he's gathered from it to tackle a broad topic. From this he has developed a very simple \\"how to\\" guide on channeling inner creativity, that anyone can use. If you go to his website, you'll find that this guy is very transparent, a trait that I find common in great teachers. All this to say, excellent book, excellent author. I'll be reading it again this evening..
B00DUIBZSK|4.0|If you are looking to purchase an album for the sake of listenign to great music this one is not for you. But if you want to listen to some music that will make you dance (or nod your head /tap your feet if your one of the sitting dancers) then this is definitely for you. Selena is not the best singer in the world, but no one buys her albums for her vocals. It fun, sassy, and little sexier than her previous music, and the beats are pretty cool.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|This movie is just an entertainment movie.  Everything about it is cheesy.  There is nothing to take serious about this movie, but to just watch it and be entertained.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|That's really all that I have to say. It might have played out a little slow for some people, but as a history buff I thought it was great. Also, Daniel Day-Lewis was an amazing Lincoln.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Transformers storyline is hard to stay true to.  It is a difficult story to make from cartoon to live action.  I didnt really like this storyline or movie.
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie...Have seen it more times than I can count...Keira Knightley is amazing as per usual...Movie makes you want to fall in love.
0061122416|3.0|I understood the theme of this book, but it wasn't in depth as I thought it would be.  It was kind of boring to read.
B002Z58GQI|5.0|Shipped very well  the unit works very good<br />Unit as described on the money works very good<br />thank you<br />rfriedman
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game so much i play it every day! this is a must-have. probably my favorite game!<br />definitely get it!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|There are many real life Fighter pilot stories out there. This one puts a human dimension to the German fighter pilots and the Nazi regime they lived and fought under. Well worth reading.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Greatest show Alive!!! I love the cliff hangers and am still undecided if I'm team Matty or team Jake ugggh! And what's with sadie? I hate that i love her :)
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This is a very well made, unflinching, yet somehow quirky film that everyone should watch! The acting is phenomenal and the story is important and entertaining.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|We were looking for a Tetris style game for our new Nexus 7. Our son downloaded it from the Amazon game store. It was a free 'App' of the day. One selects were individual blocks fall. One can not rotate or move blocks as in traditional Tetris. We have enjoyed playing it but recommend trying before buying.
071267067X|5.0|I buted the cards for a friend, I guess it is what she want itm, she like it.<br />Thanks you
B0012X6FR6|5.0|This is the quintessential piano trio album. I would reccomend this album to anybody looking for a solid 1950s jazz album. The chemistry between bill Evans, Paul motian and Scott lofaro is incredible. Don't hesitate on this one
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|It was GREAT much better than the movie! To be honest the girl in the book annoys me, but the beginning of the story is very pretty. Be prepared to cry!

B00E8S2KV2|3.0|When Fellowship of the Ring hit the theaters is was like going back in time to the release of Star Wars...the long lines, the shear fascination of imagination gone wild and put on film.  As we go back over those Star Wars adventures now, most us wonder why we stood in line for hours! The first three Star Wars movies are now barely tolerable and the second three are huge disappoints from introducing 'teddy bear' Ewoks to Jar Jar Binks.  So, who are these films aimed at, who is the intended audience?  Is it the film, the story, the characters, an emphasis aimed at some merchandising plan?  In watching Peter Jackson's Hobbit I had that 'star wars' feeling throughout much of the movie. It was the silly introduction of comic relief and an assortment of bad characters.  It's not that the acting left me wanting as much as it was how the characters we scripted and directed.  Disney movies of late have resorted to adding things in movies that are meaningless to the storyline but appeal to a target audience.  It goes without saying that at some point in a Disney today movie, especially animated ones, one or more characters is at some point going to 'pass gas' - I assume for those movie goers who are 10 and under, but then we all have to endure it, just like we did with the Ewoks and Christensen Hayden.  The Hobbit has fallen down the same worn out  'rabbit hole' as most follow-on movies and TV series reach at some point...the wonder in the wonderland of Middle Earth is lost - we've seen it all before...just as Star Wars did...for me.  It in some ways is like seeing the exterior of Star Trek's Enterprise from every possible angle, scene-after-scene, movie-after-movie...ok already. The excitement we all felt with the telling of The Lord of the Rings is like that...the Hobbit cannot reintroduce what we've already seen in every replay we've done of Middle Earth on our home DVD/Blu-ray players and truly believe it can work again as it did a decade ago.  The Hobbit cannot give thatback, the Fellowship of the Ring first experience...it just can't happen.  Maybe we have become a more sophisticated audience, more critical when we have to spend our hard earned money on movie going.  We are not seeing these movies for free, there are the actors, the studios, the executives, the sets, etc..to be paid...the profit margin.  I know there is nothing new in that but as an avid movie goer I have come to expect as much from spending my money on movie going as do the movie execs in expecting profits.  The Hobbit lost me in the first fifteen minutes...maybe it's focus on comic relief...maybe bad character development, which in turn puts us in a position where we just don't care about the characters...Bilbo for one!  The way the Hobbit is going, who knows, maybe Jackson will add some teddy bears, a 'Binks-like' irritant, scenes where the characters can 'pass gas' and maybe even a Hayden walk-on...all for the audience right?
B000I3PERS|5.0|Only one sean in this epic movie (bare breast at wedding night- tastefully done for the mature) to be concerned about for boys deemed old enough to witness heavy (real life) battle.

0307474275|5.0|A family member asked me for a recommendation for a good read in a mystery, and I was trying to think of what my favorite mysteries are of the multitude that I have read. One of Agatha Christie's for sure, Josephine Tey's story regarding King Richard, an Inspector Morse, and this book THE DA VINCI CODE would have to be in the top five.<br /><br />If you love an international setting, art, architecture, discussions of spirituality, secret codes, and history, with a macabre murder as an inciting incident, this book combines all of the above. These are all of my favorite elements. As an additional plus, you have an intellectual Robert Langdon as a professor and an equally smart and accomplished Sophie Neveu as a French cryptographer investigating together to get at the mystery behind the murder.<br /><br />Having taken writing classes, love to analyze different writer's styles and like to look at each word choice. In examining Dan Brown's prose in this book, realized there isn't one wasted word. In reading an interview with Brown, he said he writes and then distills it down over and over until only the essentials remain. It shows in the prose.<br /><br />As an aside, our librarian used to babysit Dan Brown.<br /><br />This is one of the most enjoyable mysteries I have read. It's a cerebral mystery, if you like that kind of thing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i really enjoyed it. i was anxious to read book 2 to find out what happened to the 2 main characters and their relationship
0525952926|5.0|Just a wonderful beach read.  Couldn't put it down.  Even though it is fiction, it still is a nice history refresher as much of it is historically accurate.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|While I have read some of the other reviews, this is still the entire compilation of the Beatles.  It was well worth the cost.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Couldn't be happier with White Noise. Using on Kindle Fire HD with absolutely no issues at all. Used to have a few minor bugs that would cause occasional pauses and freezes, but they've been ironed out in recent updates. You CAN combine sounds, despite what some of the reviews say. This app is easy to use and intuitive. Even my cat knows that &quot;light rain on deck&quot; means bed time, and sleeps all the way through the night right alongside me and my husband. I've struggled with insomnia and late night awakenings for 20+ years. White Noise and magnesium supplementation have changed our lives for the better when it comes to being tested and refreshed in the morning. I feel better at 40 than I did throughout my entire thirties! Thank you, White Noise!

B008602KQI|3.0|I watched the movie after reading the book and it is nothing like the book. The movie on its own is an okay movie. It plot does not explain the necessary topics covered in the book but if you are just looking for a movie to watch without having to think too much then it is the movie for you.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I have read some reviews saying that they did not like the movie because it was so different from the book. I do understand that since, after reading the fourth Harry Potter book for the second time, I watched the movie and had to stop it at least four times since I was so upset that they left out so much that I loved and thought was important.<br /><br />However, I saw the movie first and then read the book.  I think they both stand on their own.  I think seeing the movie first helped since I could then see the scenes in my mind's eye that were in the book.<br /><br />There were times that the book was very scary and then some that were touching and sad, e.g., the puppies in the pet store.<br /><br />The varied interviews gave a complete overview of the crisis.  Some of the later interviews recall some of the subjects of the earlier interviews so there is a cohesiveness.<br /><br />In conclusion, I have never been interested in zombies.  However, this was a very entertaining book and I would highly recommend it.  Having said that, for those who are squeamish, I would either not recommend the book or at least read quickly through those scenes.  :).
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Thought this movie would be a little better.  It was okay.  I should have waited until it came out on Netflix and not paid for it.  I did want to download to my Kindle Fire and try the rental portion of the Kindle Fire.  That was a great experience and will do again.

0812992792|5.0|\\"There was no doctor.  The infirmary was just a place where sick soldiers were housed until it was clear they wouldn't recover.  If the young soldier hadn't recovered by morning, the MPs would hook up a blood line and drain four units from him.  Jun Do had seen it before, and as far as he could tell, it was the best way to go.  It only took a couple minutes - first they got sleepy, then a little dreamy looking, and if there was a last little panic at the end, it didn't matter because they couldn't talk any more, and finally, before lights out, they looked pleasantly confused, like a cricket with its feelers pulled off.\\" P. 17<br /><br />This book is fiction, but fiction based in fact.  It is impossible to describe conditions in North Korea.  It is worse than we can possibly imagine.  However, that said, Adam Johnson is masterful and takes us inside a country whose elites can only inadequately be described as demented and deranged.<br /><br />Some might suggest that this cannot be real.  My own biased take is that it is all too real.  My wife was born in Korea in 1944.  I heard too many stories.  I've spent over a year in Korea.  I've stood close to the DMZ. I've seen the fortifications.  I've been on the beaches at Kunsan AB and had their defenses described to me.  I used to know what the bounty was on North Koreans infiltrators (I think roughly $40,000, but memory may fail).  I've eaten dog in Kwangju and more.  I met North Koreans in Warsaw.  Several from their embassy were declared persona non grata for black marketing goods using diplomatic passports.  The first North Korean military attaché was in Warsaw with two kids.  He talked to my wife before he realized that her husband was the American air attaché.  The look on his face was one of total shock.  We once sat next to him and his family (wife and two little daughters) at a concert.  He disappeared in the blink of an eye.  The next North Korean attaché who came in after an interval of several months avoided me totally and came without his family.<br /><br />This is a remarkable book.  It is dark, it is beyond dark.  What happens is absurd, but too real.  If you are Korean you need to read it.  If you are interested in Korea at all you need to read it.  If you want to get the best possible glimpse of what life in a totalitarian state is like, read it.  If you want to understand corruption or get a feel for things gone beyond bad read it. Some question how a non-Korean could write a book this powerful.  Part of the answer is that he did one heck of a lot of homework.  He also managed to travel in North Korea.  Finally, he had full access to the library at Stanford, one of the finest schools for East Asia in this country.  Perhaps the finest.<br /><br />Finally, I warn you, this book will get under your skin.  It is one of the best books I have read in some time.<br /><br />NB ... checked this one out of library, but will probably buy it now.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Small story filled with big characters. This filmed squeezed out all the best parts of Cooper, Lawrence, and Deniro. And by best I mean their obvious work ethic and dedication to film and story. Their raw talent is splayed open on the table.
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|I bought this solely based on the reviews and a few audio clips.  When it arrived in the mail, I'd forgotten \\"Sound of Contact\\" was the band with Phil Collins' son in it.  Because of this, I was slightly stunned that the lead singer sounded quite a bit like Phil, until I read the band list and remembered \\"ah yes, Simon is Phil's SON!!\\"  For those of you who LIKE Phil Collins' voice this is a good thing.  I do/did on most of his Genesis contributions pre-\\"Invisible Touch\\", so for me, Simon sounding like Papa Phil is a plus, though it doesn't earn any points for originality.<br /><br />All-in-all, Dimensionaut is nice neoprogish, melodic rock.  For some reason musically I would put this closer to Genesis' \\"Calling All Stations\\" than any of their other work (ironic since Papa Phil didn't sing on that), and compared to the post-90's prog out there, it falls more in the Porcupine Tree side of the street than the Flower Kings or Spock's Beard, but more like more poppy Porcupine Tree (if that makes sense).<br /><br />Nothing on this REALLY blew me away, but I did enjoy it, and was happy to discover it.  Decently written songs, nice melodies, decent arrangements, and pretty good performances, even with Simon's vocals.<br /><br />In summary, if you're a neo-prog fan (Marillion, IQ, Genesis, etc) I think you'll like it.
B008OOYALE|2.0|When I first started playing it was a decent game then  1.I wanted to expand my land so I waited till it was done and I used up my coins to clear it all when I put a habitat down it said sorry u need to own this land to place a habitat well I had just cleared it and u have to own that land to clear it  2.

B00DRPVE3M|1.0|It takes a pretty long time for the game yo register moves by you and others, the game is very flashy and complicated, and the games I'm in will randomly crash so I lose the tokens I put in.  It only took 10 minutes flr me to realize how strongly I disliked the game.  I recomend this game to people who:<br />1. Have infinite money to spend on tokens.<br />2. Have infinite patience to wait for lag, ads, and more scratch games that obviously don't promote gambling and the lottery in a kid's game.<br />3. Can hack games like these for infinite tokens and no ads.<br />4. People who are so pationate about this awesome kid's game that they can look past the cheats you can buy with points, shameful attempts at milking the users of the app for every last penny they'll spend, the not-so-subtle gambling reference in a game reccomended for people of all ages, which includes small children, the confusing layout, and the various glitches, crashes, and other problems with the game.  If you are any of the above 4 people, you should get the game.  Otherwise you will be greatly disappointed.
B003DBOS7Y|1.0|Never watched it in HD!! The process is idiotic! Having to find your TV on a list is ridiculous. We tried our iPad and that didn't work either! Even my tech savy son was at a loss. Wasted $3.99 stick to Netflix!

B00C8USQEM|5.0|Had to have some seasons of this show. OMG! Does it make me laugh. Have had this partial set for a while and it is getting my husband and me through a very difficult time right now. We are losing a very precious and dearly loved family member. To escape the grief, even for a little while, well, I HIGHLY recommend &#34;The Big Bang Theory!&#34;
B000NDMRCS|3.0|I'm not sure Hollywood could have squeezed in any more plot devices designed to scold America (as opposed to moving the story forward). Boiling away all the pretentious finger wagging, the plot is typical disaster movie fare and Dennis Quaid does a decent job holding things together. The special effects are above average and make the movie worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Plot: Climatologist matches current weather pattern with predicted ice age scenario. Wastes time trying to motivate climate change deniers. Diaster strikes. Government turns to climatologist for advice. Climatologist backhands them a recommendation and sets off to rescue his son. Loses sidekicks along the way. Sela Ward added as window dressing. Climatologist saves son and their relationship. America devastated but with sliver of hope for the future with Mexico's help.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was reluctant to see this move, how could it compare to the original?  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did not take the same tact as the original, and made these characters as likable as the original cast.  Definitely a fan and definitely a keeper!

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Is a really great game , when you are bored at your house or anywhere. I really recommend to anyone really.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|This movie is too leaden with cliches and action-movie tropes.  The heroes' and villains' posturing, their mugging and the nonsensical script (e.g. if they bad guys are tring to rule the world, why are they going after commuters in NYC?).  Everyone has a veneer of pomposity and the formulaic summer movie gets lost in a sea of similar forgettables.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I &lt;3 this game. its the best game ever. I play it every day almost. if u weren't sure to download it I'm telling you my opinion.

The images and prints huge and crisp, and the write-ups detailed and informative.<br /><br />This is the only art/making of Harry Potter book you need. Highly recommended.

B00DUGCLY4|1.0|The game was over within minutes. It goes to level five and then it's over. Why even create a game if your not going to make it a bit more longer and challenging. Just a waste. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I am simply trying to update reviews from 10 years ago. Pappillion is one of the greatest films ever made. It is the BEST of Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the pure vista... this film was done when they did `on locations'. You've all seen the film or read the reviews, but I need to point out the realism. McQueen and Hoffman play their roles with blackened teeth to recreate the realisom of a convicts life on a secluded prison island in French Guinea. THAT is realism, and not CG.<br /><br />I am updating the reviews for the generation that has lost themselves in CG and special effects. This film was done real. For that generation, I say, PLEASE watch this film. Please. Again, the cinetography will amaze you. THIS is what movies were meant to be.
1612680011|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone, whether there planning on being an investor or not. There is some great advice in here thrown at you in a very inspirational and engaging way. This book will change the way you think financially and i would recommend it to anyone.

B0015AARJI|5.0|I got this to use on my PC as a controller because I prefer the PS3 controller layout much more than the xbox 360 controller layout. This does require using 3rd party drivers to do, but for me it was worth it. I suggest anyone looking to do this to look up &#34;Better DS3&#34; to use for making the connection. It still requires the motion joy drivers, but if you get the drivers separate from the program you do not need to install the big ugly motionjoy that is full of advertisements and send you to some website every time you turn on your computer. Better DS3 has no advertisements, a clean interface, does not require you to be connected to the internet, and has worked much more reliably for me.<br /><br />Get this, get Better DS3, get your game on.

B0068MNO4S|5.0|I love Elizabethan costume drama. Not sure why. Maybe it's the costumes, or the characters.<br /><br />Elizabeth I has a pivotal role in this film, although it is not really about her. But it is always fun to watch her strut her stuff on the screen.<br /><br />Elizabeth I, who was obviously a real monarch, is such a powerful personage that she makes a great film character. And she does in this movie, which is half the reason for watching it.<br /><br />Vanessa Redgrave's Elizabeth is a lavish, but aged, confused, and weak Queen who is frightened and vulnerable - very different from what we are used to in 'Bess Movies'. She's also the female equivalent of a 'stud', having given birth to many illegitimate children, in secret, of course - yeah, sure.<br /><br />The historical Bess was as much an actress as a monarch. The design of her clothes was chosen carefully to make her look larger than life. He father, Henry VIII started the trend, but then he WAS larger than life, at over 6 feet tall, and by the end of his life, so heavy (let's avoid the unkind word 'fat') that he had to be carried on a litter.<br /><br />Like Henry, Bess held a lavish court to impress diplomats and visiting dignitaries. England was an emerging power and needed to look the part. Court drama and intrigue were in high gear, or so we are told in our time.<br /><br />Which brings to mind the words: \\"All the world's a stage...\\" Truth and fiction become mixed and indistinguishable. And this film is a perfect example of it, but it's fun to watch, none the less.<br /><br />And of course, Elizabeth reigned when Will Shakespeare was writing all those boffo plays and sonnets. Or did he?<br /><br />That's the absurd yet tantalizing crux of this movie, that Shakespeare was a manipulative blackmailing fraud and the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, was the true author of all Shakespeare's works. Only he had to stay anonymous for political and social reasons, and the religious fanatics, the Cecil's, didn't like him, or he didn't like them, and he was in a loveless marriage of inconvenience, or blackmail, or something - it's all very confusing. Again, why the film is fun, it keeps you as off balance as the entire concept is unbalanced!<br /><br />So watch it with tongue-in-cheek and wink-of-eye. Then it works and works well.<br /><br />It's an intriguing concept, but a bit of a mash up as a film. I dismissed the plausibility of the premise as soon as I saw that Edward de Vere was wearing more eye makeup than Elizabeth I (the Queen of Makeup) herself! Although it really made his face stand out and brought out his features, anyone who can out do Elizabeth in the make up department - and not be confined to the Tower - is obviously not for real!<br /><br />Which leaves the film to be enjoyed for what I feel it really is, a highly fanciful historical costume drama.<br /><br />I liked the film, for its costumes (Elizabeth was really well decked out!), the court intrigue (those evil puritanical, fanatical, pro-Scottish Cecils), and the commoner's intrigue -- Shakespeare, Marlow and Jonson all plotting against and threatening each other in between visits to the ale house and brothel -- with an occasional play thrown in to keep us on track.<br /><br />I recommend the film for the fun of seeing Elizabethan England yet again, with the contrasts between the squalor and the opulence (the squalor being the common folk, the opulence, the court).<br /><br />Watch it for the great actors - all of them -  and their convincing portrayals of historical characters who are so distorted that they are fictional (if they were accurate, they'd have been unbelievably dull). History is written by the victors, or something like that!<br /><br />Enjoy it for the fantasy that Elizabeth I, far from being the \\"Virgin Queen\\", was the mother of many who became nobles.<br /><br />Yes, in this adventure, Bess has children, SEVERAL children yet does not know who they are (not even their names), but the Cecil'sdo? Uh huh, one of the greatest political leaders and strategists of England is clueless about her secret offspring... okay...<br /><br />And, she -- one of the most publicly recognized and closely guarded monarchs in history (she was under threat of death by Pope Pius V who had excommunicated her, among other problems) -- does this in secret-- in a world where secrets were really hard to keep? Look at Henry's reign, everyone was telling on everyone else! Wonderfully absurd!<br /><br />That should be a giveaway that the movie is a mash up. If they threw in a few zombies (I think I saw some in the Globe Theater audience) it could not have been more absurd!<br /><br />But it is not the absurdity of the premise of the film that should be an issue. This can be dismissed as an elaborate joke on us.<br /><br />If done so, I think you can enjoy the film for the interplay of the characters, the brilliant acting, the very well composed dialog (okay, Shakespeare wrote half of it anyway), the cinematography the costumes, the sets. All this is very well done and there is enough eye candy to satisfy any historical fan. As cinema, this is a very fine and well crafted movie.<br /><br />I admit, there aren't any high speed car chases (how'd they miss out on those?) but there are some pseudo explosions (mostly staged explosions and cannon fire) for fans of such stuff.<br /><br />They also used an intriguing approach to the whole thing by wrapping it in a kind of flashback.<br /><br />The film opens in modern day New York supposedly as a stage play itself, narrated by noted Shakespearean actor, Derek Jacobi. As Jacobi (always a treat) narrates, the film morphs from stage to full screen and we are transported to Elizabethan London. At the end of the film (after everyone dies), we are transported back with equal grace and hear some very serious conjecturing about the truth and validity of the whole thing, and the glory of the plays and sonnets (which at least IS true). As silly as that is, it moved me because I really liked the characters and was still getting over their dying off. That's the problem with historical fiction, everyone dies in the end. Nevertheless, I liked this approach in the film, I thought it was clever.<br /><br />The film also does two things that most historical dramas ignore:<br /><br />1. It actually rains - a LOT - in England. What a concept!<br /><br />2. The interiors are all dark, in spite of many, many candles burning as brightly as they can. (The lighting in this film must have been very tricky to engineer)<br /><br />We know from history and climate that this, at least, is accurate. It was a wet, dank, dark, dirty age.<br /><br />So we have some 'authentic' stuff mixed in with the most fantastical plot, confusing the whole thing for us.<br /><br />Yet it is an enjoyable film and a 'who-done-it-to-whom.'<br /><br />I say, enjoy the confusion -- especially the flashbacks that make it impossible until the end to know what's really going on. Robert Cecil, like any good villain, can't help but brag at the end when he's truly defeated Edward de Vere (whom he hates with a passion) just how he did it! Thank goodness, I'd never have figured it out otherwise!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />This is a very well crafted and fun film when taken for what it is, an elaborate fantasy suggesting alternative history. It's a fun ride to explore 'what if Shakespeare didn't write his plays'. It's fun to go back in time and once more see how bad living conditions were -- maybe we wouldn't complain so much if we appreciated how far we have come.<br /><br />And there's Elizabeth I.<br /><br />Any film with her in it is a must see for me.do? Uh huh, one of the greatest political leaders and strategists of England is clueless about her secret offspring... okay...<br /><br />And, she -- one of the most publicly recognized and closely guarded monarchs in history (she was under threat of death by Pope Pius V who had excommunicated her, among other problems) -- does this in secret-- in a world where secrets were really hard to keep? Look at Henry's reign, everyone was telling on everyone else! Wonderfully absurd!<br /><br />That should be a giveaway that the movie is a mash up. If they threw in a few zombies (I think I saw some in the Globe Theater audience) it could not have been more absurd!<br /><br />But it is not the absurdity of the premise of the film that should be an issue. This can be dismissed as an elaborate joke on us.<br /><br />If done so, I think you can enjoy the film for the interplay of the characters, the brilliant acting, the very well composed dialog (okay, Shakespeare wrote half of it anyway), the cinematography the costumes, the sets. All this is very well done and there is enough eye candy to satisfy any historical fan. As cinema, this is a very fine and well crafted movie.<br /><br />I admit, there aren't any high speed car chases (how'd they miss out on those?) but there are some pseudo explosions (mostly staged explosions and cannon fire) for fans of such stuff.<br /><br />They also used an intriguing approach to the whole thing by wrapping it in a kind of flashback.<br /><br />The film opens in modern day New York supposedly as a stage play itself, narrated by noted Shakespearean actor, Derek Jacobi. As Jacobi (always a treat) narrates, the film morphs from stage to full screen and we are transported to Elizabethan London. At the end of the film (after everyone dies), we are transported back with equal grace and hear some very serious conjecturing about the truth and validity of the whole thing, and the glory of the plays and sonnets (which at least IS true).

B008XBHIEY|3.0|Made so long before CGI, the movie is still entertaining but it is a bit dated.  Did not realized that I was getting the &#34;deleted scenes&#34; version, which did not help.  Still entertaining though.
031620157X|5.0|My 10 year old daughter absolutely loved this book!  She borrowed a copy and was captured by the story from the start. She was so engrossed and would excitedly share parts as she read along.  Just ordered the 2nd book from Amazon!
B002VQ7PVS|3.0|I liked the concept of unraveling the story through a Eva's daughter.  Great tension in the Eva's story.  Knocked it down a star because I found the in the drifting narrative into Bader Meinhof and protests of the Shah (both of which went nowhere) irritating intrusions to a good story.  This is the first of several William Boyd's I have in the hopper so time will tell if some of the raves for his work are justified.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Grear series, never really watched it on TV, thanks to Amazon for haviing it available<br />The series plots and the episode stories are beyond the normal &#34;Law&#34; program.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Not normally a gameplayer, but buying this was a good impulse purchase: outstanding graphics; evil puzzles. Definitely an &quot;aawwww&quot; feeling when the &quot;Game Complete&quot; screen flashed.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Witty humor, office politics, sexual tension, drama and the power of the law being bent and twisted to the brink of breaking and then some.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|The mouse has some really nice points to it for the price point and has a lot of potential for a company that is really trying to break out into the gaming mouse department.  I use a modified Palm/Claw grip while using a mouse, its mostly palm during everyday use and MMO gaming, but with the claw being thrown in while I play FPS games.  I have large meaty hands but not basketball or football player hands, just everyday working hands.  So of course this is my own personal opinion of the mouse that was sent and how I use and hold the mouse.  Some people call them mice and others call them mouses so I used both to not start an argument.<br /><br />The GOOD:<br />-  The price is really great for all the options that are included in this mouse, a lot of \\"higher\\" end mouse have these options and some have even less but they want to charge more for some special option or feature that is standard in this mouse.<br /><br />-  The simplistic weight system is a good attempt at allowing the user to very the weight slightly to get the right feel of the mouse that they want or are looking for.<br /><br />-  The programmable buttons are a really nice addition to this mouse as they let you program the button to take different actions both in games and outside the games, you can program a button to save files or close the program, not too bad for a \\"basic\\"  gaming mouse.<br /><br />-  The lighting is an interesting addition to this mouse as it allows you to change the color on the logo and have it pulse or breath at 4 different speeds, the program allows for a multitude of different colors as well as a color wheel to color more then the preset one, as they said 16 million backlight colors to chose from.<br /><br />-  There is a button on the bottom of the mouse that allows you to quickly change the programming profile to bring up a second program so that you can have one profile setup for your regular windows use and another ready for your favorite game or games or whatever combination that you like.<br /><br />-  Certain parts of the mouse have a very nice textured or rubberized feel and look to them and makes for gripping the mouse a little easier, the braided cable and gold plated use end are very nice additions as well and give the premium look to the mouse.<br /><br />***Now for the bad, this is of course from the mouse that was sent to me and may not be indicative of all the ones out there!***<br /><br />The BAD:<br />-  The mouse just does not feel right in my hand, after using it for a three hour gaming session I started to cramp up in the hand.  This did not happen with my previous mice/mouses, and I have played for longer with them, a Razer, Cyborg, and Logitech, all gaming mice/mouses.  For me the ergonomics just seem to be off and I can't get the proper feel for the mouse.  I know a person has to get used to the new mouse, the breaking in period, but most of the other I used prior had more of a just right feel to them from the start.<br /><br />-  The weight system is still an interesting idea but the design is not that well thought out, they used a piece of foam with holes in it to have the weights placed inside each hole for the overall desired weight.  Sadly if you want to take out a weight you have to be very careful with the ones around the perimeter as they can actually fall into the mouse if you hold it at an angle.<br /><br />-  While having the programmable buttons are a great idea in this case it only kind of works because of the software.  The software is not really that forgiving as you have to Alt-Tab or exit the game/program you are in to get the right keystroke combination that you want for said program.  It would be nice to have a pre-made profile that is available from the website to encompass most FPS or MMO style games out there.  A nice sniper button/DPI setting would have been great like a lot of other popular modern mice/mouses have.<br /><br />-  The lighting and breathing/pulsing can only be changed and turnoff where the Anker logo is, which is bewildering to me as most of the time my hand is on the mouse and covering the logo, so I turned it off.  The lights on the scroll wheel and the DPI indicator do not change color and cannot be set to pulse, which once again drives me a little crazy as these are the lights you see the most while using the mouse.  For me it was 16 million colors that I did not use or choose from to be honest.<br /><br />-  The scroll wheel on the mouse I received did not register or even move properly for the first 20 minutes of using the mouse, then after using the mouse for a bit it seems to work fine.  The opening where the scroll wheel goes into the mouse seems to be very sharp and I have caught my finger on it when scrolling the mouse very quickly at times.<br /><br />-  The paint on the three side buttons is very cheap feeling and the mouse came with some of the paint coming off on the forward most button (button # 4), plus there seems to be a lot of play or movement in the buttons, they don't have a solid feel like some of the other buttons.<br /><br />-  The top forward most button (button # 7) the one with the dimples on it, the one that is used for macro playback on the default programming is so loose that you can hear it rattle when you shake the mouse slightly.  Even picking up and re-positioning the mouse can cause it to rattle a little.  There is also something on the inside of the mouse that rattles a little when you shake it.<br /><br />-  While certain parts of the mouse have a decent feel to them there are glossy parts of the mouse that just feel right, and one of those being the pinky and ring finger area.  The thumb rest area has a rubberized finish but the pinky area has a slippery glossy finish.<br /><br />-  The braided cord connected at the head of the mouse is loose and moves around a little bit when you move the mouse, you can grab it and move it up and down and side to side since the plastic around it is slightly warped.  Its not falling out or extremely bad, but it does leave me to question if it already loose how long will it last in the future.<br /><br />-  There seems to be a tad bit of lag when using the mouse at times, its not often and constant but its there.  Even on 1000 Hz polling rate and 1800 or 2400 DPI I still get a tad bit of lag a times, its not a ton of lag but a small skip or jump here that is only really noticeable when you are looking for once you have seen it before.<br /><br />In conclusion:<br />As I stated this is not a bad mouse by any means and is a really good start for a company trying to make their mark in the gaming mouse industry.  Matter of fact they are off to a good start since a bunch of top brand manufacturers had some really bad mice/mouses when they first started out.  As I said before the mouse is good for what it does and it seems to do well for a lot of other reviewers, but for me the mouse just did not have that really good or great feel to it to get me to love it, so this is not really the mouse for me.  That is why I am trying to be a little objective and give it a decent review and not slam it for the problems that I had with the mouse.<br /><br />Hope you enjoyed and thanks for reading.

B00632HWOG|2.0|This app works just fine if all you want to do is check mail. However, it does NOT include the calendar tab that is on my laptop version of Yahoo.  I realize that Yahoo promotes its own search engine, and Android is run by their rival, Google. I just think it is really petty for both businesses that monopolize the mobile market to not work together on a Yahoo calendar app that can run on android.  Yahoo won't allow Google calendar, and Google won't allow Yahoo calendar so neither will sync with eachother.  I think there is enough calendar business to go around that these companies should not feel threatened by eachother.  You should not be forced to use only a calendar app by a specific company. This stupidity is why so many people go to Apple!

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Possibly the best Superhero movie ever made. Joss Whedon shows again that a movie that can be dramatic without going dark and be uplifting all at the same time. He show's true love for the characters that has been lacking in other comic book movies in the past. This is a movie made by geeks for geeks. And everyone is a geek at some level.

0740748475|5.0|I would easily run out of superlatives trying to describe this masterpiece. The Complete Calvin and Hobbes is simply a must-have for any comic strip enthusiast or sequential art lover. There's also some extra material giving the readers more insight into Bill Watterson's creative process and the strips' background. I just can't recommend this enough.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This movie was a must see for me, being as I like visual design & sci-fi. My main gripe was the cursing. The arranged company of the two main characters was murky, at best. Those two things make this an unfriendly family film, when it could have been closer to being one. The sound quality was very nice. I also liked how real most of the movie felt, with an exception or two. Sally was really quite the contradiction. Everything wasn't explained, nor did everything make perfect sense, but I still enjoyed it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Began watching this series about a month ago - could not get it on my local rural cable service. I like the pace, the dialogue and the relationships developed in season 1 and that continue in season 2. Looking forward to Season 3 - a challenge not to &#34;view ahead!&#34;
B007DA2FHG|5.0|Mark Twain's observation is a fitting title for a review of this rousing screen production with which Stephen Spielberg has gifted us.<br />  Based on a stage play of the same name, it follows the World War I adventures of a brown mare named Joey, born and raised on a farm in Devon, England by farm boy Albert Narracott( Jeremy Irvine), who lives on a family farm with his father(Peter Mullan)and mother(Emily Watson).<br /> They endure a challenging relationship with their land owner,David Lyons(David Thewlis in his first film since the close of the \\"Harry Potter\\" franchise), but young Albert impresses Mr. Lyons and the other landowners  with his ability to use Joey to plow a challenging plot of land. But soon the financially strapped Mr. Narracott sells  Joey to Captain Nicols(Tom Hiddleston), despite the pleas of a devastated Albert as World War I begins and many horses from local farms are recruited for the fight. The now-tattered banner carried by Mr. Narracott in a previous war, will be the distinguishing artifact identifying Joey as his perilous adventure begins.<br /> The throughbread is attracted to a beautiful black mare  who will share many of his wartime escapades by the name of Topthorn.<br /> The two have an exhilarating race against each other as part of their and their officer's basic training.<br />  Soon they are in France facing combat against the Germans, and Joey rushes through the forest sans his rider under heavy artillery fire only to end up in German custody with Topthorn.<br />  The dual equine adventure continues as two brothers in the Kaiser's Army(David Kross and Leonard Carrow) use them in an ill-fated attempt to desert.<br />  Left in a windmill by the brothers, they are found by a sickly French orphan named Emilie(Celine Buckens)who lives on the farm where the windmill is situated with her grandfather(Niels Arestrup).<br />  Tending to the horses brightens the young girl's life. But while she was initially able to save them from confiscation when the German Army raided their farm and home for food, to her great devastation, Emilie fails to shield them from another attempted confiscation. The Hippie Era  slogan, \\"War is unhealthy for children, and other living things\\" receives more than enough visual emphasis in this scene.<br />  With their furlough from battle all too abruptly ended, they are made to pull heavy German artillery, and the conflict becomes more brutal.<br />  Joey will grieve a loss and gallop around, over, and through the trenches to get past the human madness of artillery fire in a scene that makes one have further regrets how Man's shameful inability to solve disputes peacefully has such terrifying impact on all living creatures. War is the ultimate stupid human trick!<br />  But there is a brief moment of unity when two officers from opposite sides of the conflict help free Joey from entanglement in barbed wire.<br />  By this time, Albert has joined the conflict and despite the odds of finding him, is looking for Joey with a moving sense of dogged determination.<br />  A post Harry-Potter era Matthew Lewis appears as a soldier in the trenches, and Liam Cunning plays an Army doctor presiding over a fateful decision involving Joey.<br />  Viewers can learn the ultimate fate of the two-legged and four-legged combatants against a beautiful golden twilight.-A serene and solemnly triumphant ending!

B00006ADD5|4.0|The cinematography is just amazing. The film is at its greatest when it immerses you in the stark beauty of the desert.<br /><br />Lawrence was a wild man no doubt, with the passions of a British Tommy prophet and the self-doubt of any man, constantly questioning himself, and always going back for more. I think the movie touched on that well.<br /><br />I cannot attest to the historical accuracy of the movie, but I can tell you this. This movie captures his adventurous side, and the wickedness of politics when the fate of entire country is at stake.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B003UESJH4|4.0|The movie is well-acted, staged, shot.<br /><br />It humanizes the Royals, showing they are more than a crown, smile and wave.<br /><br />Here you see their power and privilege, but also their weaknesses and the hard path to earn their loyalty. The movie also emphasizes courage and friendship.<br /><br />I liked it once, but I don't want to see it again. It is one of those films that tries a little too hard to be cute and perfect, and nearly succeeds. But those lofty goals are both its finest strength and its defining weakness.<br /><br />The film is a great achievement for the year, no doubt, and I am glad to have seen it. But I don't think it is one that will rise to prominence in the all-time hall of great cinema, and I really wanted it to be.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, and the Royals interest you, go, watch and<br /><br />Enjoy!

He is very well known in the UK not so much here. Watch him, he is an awesome entertainer! Really connects with the audience. I had never heard of him but truly a fan now!. Some of the other disks are not as well recorded but this was such an accomplishment, all to raise awareness. Buy it, you won't be sorry! I have given so many as gifts plus any time someone sees the Pink Floyd reunion at my house they go out and buy it!!!! I should be on commission!

B0091LS07E|5.0|When this album first came out at the end of last year,my opinion on it were based on two things: all too brief previews online and the presence of Nicki Minaj. Being someone who appreciates music broadly and whose NOT a Nicki Minaj fan,these were not selling points. Regretfully I had a great deal of negative opinions on the creative choices Alicia Keys has been making on her last several albums. There seemed to be this sense that she was reaching for more of an adult contemporary musical crowd, as opposed to applying her brilliant musicianship to music that held an identification for a young audience to expand their musical tastes. Apparently quite a long album in the making,probably due to her marriage to Swizz Beats and the birth of their child, this is a very intensely conceptualized albums whose musical values are better taken as a whole rather than through soundbites.<br /><br />  \\"De Nova Adagio\\" opens the album with one of Alicia's classically inspired piano solos before \\"Brand New Me\\" comes along,a brash example of what I'd call arena neo soul with big gated drums backing up Alicia's piano and triumphant vocal delivery. \\"When Its All Over\\" is a daringly jazzy number-with a big piano/bass/drum arrangement. \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" is a rhythmically slinky groove,featuring Rodney Darkchild Jerkins mixing in some layered drum effects for good measure. \\"New Day\\" is another arena neo soul number-only with more obvious pep squad type fan fare to it. \\"Girl On Fire\\" takes that arena friendly/big drum sound to full effect. When I ignore Minaj's typically shallow rap on the song (sorry Minaj fans-just my opinion) its not a bad anthemic type number. \\"Fire We Make\\",with it's subtlety funky synth bass lines with Maxwell is one of my favorites here,and introduces the more soul/funk oriented second half of the album.<br /><br />  \\"Tears Always Win\\"-an organ heavy gospel/soul number featuring instrumental collaboration with Bruno Mars continues in that vein-along with the brilliant Al Green/HI style ballad \\"One Thing\\". The solo piano \\"Not Even A King\\",with its poignant anti capitalist lyrical framework. \\"That's When I Knew\\" is breezy acoustic soul,where \\"Limitedless finds her exploring the reggae-ton sub genre heavily. The album closes with the epic \\"101\\"-growing from an acoustic piano solo pieces into a big drum arena anthem again. So no this album isn't all funk,or all soul or all jazz. It combines them with some 80's drumming and production for this arena soul sound that goes well the musical broadness she's gained from her travelling in London and Jamaica. All the songs stand well alone or together but are extremely cinematic-not boding well to any preview as mentioned earlier. Lyrically this album explores overcoming romantic,musical and social doubts from a strongly feminine perspective. Its one album I very highly underrated. And if you have too,it may take you a couple full listens as it did me to fully absorb this albums...musical and conceptual boldness and brilliance.illiant Al Green/HI style ballad \\"One Thing\\".

B000051VWW|5.0|Perhaps it was some negativism from 1992 that led many people,including myself to think that Sade were through as a band following their [[ASIN:B000051XXD Love Deluxe]] album from that year,which is often still considered the finest album they ever recorded. As hard as it is to disagree with that it probably created some difficulty for Sade and her fellow band members. Having released a fairly regular stream of albums from 1984 through 92,all of a sudden the band disappeared for the remainder of the decade-recording only without their lead singer/songwriter under the name Sweetback. When they emerged over eight years later with this album,my family and I were very surprised. But for me not quite as much as when I heard what they were offering.<br /><br />  \\"By Your Side\\" offers up a sweetly melodic acoustic guitar based melody which is continued on \\"Every Word. Meanwhile \\"Flow\\",\\"Someobody Already Broke My Heart\\" and \\"Immigrant\\"-with its \\"dance a step in my feet\\" outlook on racial prejudice have a deeply sinuous jazzy funk groove that is undeniably Sade. \\"King Of Sorry\\" is a very complex number. It's a mixture of jazzy rhythms,funky wah wah and this strong Latin pop flavor that was actually emerging as a major force in pop music at this time. \\"Slave Ship\\" is a stirring,echoed reggae number with Sade reflecting on the experiencing of a slave being transported as cargo,their hopes and struggles. \\"All About Our Love\\" is a rhythmic and danceable Latin/soul-pop type number while \\"The Sweetest Word\\" is stark Brazilian acoustic folk balladry. The title song is a wonderful jazzy funk groove-my personal favorite on the album and it ends with the cinematic torch/jazz ballad \\"It's Only Love That Gets You Through\\".<br /><br />  Instrumentally Sade have always defined themselves with their stripped down sound. At the same time it didn't always seem that way because the sounds were so full and the production so slick. This comeback album strips away all the production slickness for,at most, a hollow reverb on occasion. Not only that, but the bands already economical musicianship is pared down even more-to the point where on several songs it sounds like only three instruments being played. This is also their most acoustically textured album-featuring some very Brazilian style guitars and emphasis on rhythmic subtly. Sade's usually yearning vocal tone is replaced by a rather sad and downbeat one here. The lyrical outlook of this album seems to focus on the social and romantic climate of the new millennium with great trepidation. As it turns out,the level of concern was very well founded. However it was nice to ring in the 21st century not only with a new Sade album,but a new Sade willing to expand their already established sound.r,at most, a hollow reverb on occasion.

B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I recommed this book because it is full of commentaries about Americans by someone who has a foreign perspective as well as life experience in the states.  Our leading lady is sometimes hard to like but never impossible to grasp.  Life in the US went from impossible survival to valuable connections and the doors it opens.  She never settles.  She becomes wiser through experiences and lifts her voice for all to hear.  The process of growing and becoming flows like water sometimes serene and clear and turbulent at times.  It was great to hear the voices of Black people speaking amongst themselves and seeing blacks interrelate with whites.  It was great to see the well meant but hipocrasy of liberalism, the way immigrants are taken advantage of and abused not just in the U S, and to see those that we can all find our way back to a more authentic and wise part of ourselves.  As a New Havener I also liked the many mentions of my &#34;neglected&#34; city.  This book was an excellent investment of my time.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|It is all here, in a generally excellent format.  My only quibble is that the stories in the Return of SH are in alphabetical rather than published order.  You will want to read them as published.  I recommend bookmarking the TOC so you can always find your way around.  This issue keeps it from 5 stars, but the price is right.  And you cannot beat classic SH.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Very good story line.  Like all characters. Very true, funny and reminds me of my high school days.  Jenna rocks
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app that makes my life much easier! My Kindle is a constant bedtime companion and this app makes that companion even more useful.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love going through everything, I try to make sure I have plenty of time for the computer before I ever go to Pinterest because I enjoy seeing everything.Just one really big complaint. Maybe it is because I have missed something, but trying to get information that they say &#34; there is a lot of information on the site&#34; but you can't find the site.I  have gone back on so many pins that I have had trouble getting back where I started. There is a wonderful world of information if  we could just get to it. If I am doing something  wrong I wish someone would tell me how to do it the right way. Thanks for all that you do provide, these people that post are just plain geniuses and so much talent in one spot is exciting. thanks for all that  you have provided us.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Too many glitches. All the game maker cares about is the almighty dollar. If you have lots of cash in your pocket to throw at a game that has many errors, go for it.
B000089770|5.0|It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Brilliant.  It arrived safe and sound and I'm grateful I added it to my favorites.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I had to purchase this season to play catch up since I didn't start watching it from the beginning. So glad I caught up. The cast is hilarious
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an extremely fast read, great for summer. I literally could not put this book down, you need to keep reading at the end of every chapter. Watch out for the plot twists...
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Excellent sound. This helped to pass the time on the plane or other areas w/out wifi when you don't have streaming music.
B001XVCYH2|4.0|Finally understood it better after watching all three in a row. It's a trilogy, I'd watch again and again, with a slightly different take on it each time.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read the 1st book, and felt the need to at least try the 2nd book. I lost interest after the 1st few chapters. If I had to read &#34;Christian Gray&#34; one more time I was going to puke! Who really calls their significant other by their 1st and last name every single time!?!
1781162646|4.0|More like 3.5 stars.  As much as this was given great reviews by the papers and such, I thought it would blow me away.  It was a good read, but didn't knock me off my feet.

B00DB31Y3U|3.0|Maybe it's me, maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but it seems like an RC sim app mixed with arcade style gameplay.  The reason why it gets three stars instead of five is because it doesn't particularly do the simulation well, and seems quite limited in its gameplay.  After a few missions I was bored and ended up uninstalling the app.  I've used other RC simulation apps that did not have the arcade style gameplay and did not get bored with them as quickly, even though they did not have missions or rockets.  It feels like you are doing pretty much the same thing over and over, which gets boring.<br /><br /> It's honestly not a bad game, just not what I expected.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I love this band. This is a great album by them. Helped pass the time on the plane when I didn't have Pandora.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|great series of videos. good priced. great condition. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have the full series.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Serves the purpose. This was an accessory purchased for my mother when she got the Kindle Fire. With the grandkids around I wanted to get a solid, hardcover case so when the Fire was dropped it was still protected.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I like it no complaints I came when it said it would and I cant really argue with that at all
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Excellent sound. This helped to pass the time on the plane or other areas w/out wifi when you don't have streaming music.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I like it no complaints I came when it said it would and I cant really argue with that at all
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I survived book 1 out of principle since everyone and their mother seemed to be reading it. This series is just not for me. You either love it or hate it.
140053271X|4.0|Works great , has more features than I thought it did and well worth the price I would buy again
B00138KKMQ|5.0|Great album all in one. I downloaded this so I could have some music to listen to when there was no wi-fi available (vacation and on the plane).
B009YN2M7S|5.0|It was n amazing love story..I loved it loved it.. would read again n again...th Nicholas Sparks for good work.

B00BMR5HOO|5.0|Love this app. Can pick different cities and watch them all. Recommended this to all my friends. Five stars easily.
B009346RSS|5.0|Well, here is a quickie review on the 3rd gen D03K that may help others trying to research for specific uses. For the $$ this nice little piece is a great, fun DAC. I am a big music library fan, with a nice networked music library ripped in bit-perfect wav files. I had added a Sonos Connect (ZP90) player to my not so bad of shop stereo comprised of some great, mid-fi, mostly outdated components laying around: PSB large format bookshelf speaks, HK analog Pre/Pro, Onkyo discrete stereo amp, decent interconnects, etc.<br />This system has a pretty nice level of fidelity to where you can hear things and I was experiencing one of the only weaknesses of Sonos, their DAC is a little disappointing when playing on higher fidelity setups where you can hear such things. The analog outs on the ancient Sony DVD unit I was using to play CDs was slaying the Sonos in SQ.<br />Enter the FiiO unit. Set Sonos to uncompressed (if your files are lossless), fixed volume out (for full bit depth), coax digital to FiiO/analog to pre. Yes!! The result is blacker background, increased precision, tightened yet solid bass, in this case it did cure the minor dissatisfaction of listening through the onboard Sonos DAC. Since I had both Sonos/FiiO connected to the amp, asked my audiophile in training kid to do a blind A/B (I level matched between switching, so there was a 4 sec delay) he chose the FiiO every time in random selections over a several minute period.<br />So, not saying this will beat a Benchmark, or mod the opamps to TL^%$$^ or anything like that. (it's a shop stereo man!)But it is pretty fun to enjoy a marked audio improvement with this cute, no-brainer install, under $30.00 little DAC. Sure it works great for stereo TV if the set is outputting PCM too.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved Pam Grout's book I read it and re read it, it's one to keep on your bedside table.
B0063S3DMK|5.0|amazon makes me type a bunch of words. what a waste. just get the movie. u will like it. if you don't then maybe u need to take some classes or something.
B002RI9MWA|4.0|A tightly written monologue with a  great sense of atmosphere and thoughtful, wry reflections on America and the Islamic world. Nice to have someone attempt to view this from the perspective of the 'other' for a change. I wish I'd read the book before seeing the fiim however.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|There is no way this movie can be missed. The classic one- liners and the lessons that can be gathered are a necessity for everyone!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I like Hosseinis writing but didn't find this book as compelling as his two earlier ones, both of which were outstanding.
0553801473|5.0|I couldn't wait for the paperback version to come out.  I'm three quarters the way through the book and loving it.  I want to finish it, but I'm afraid to see the end.  I hope there will be more books in this series.
1936608898|5.0|I love that this book has the scientific side of weightloss and health but it puts it in a way that everyone can understand!  We can't wait to start our Whole30
0553103547|5.0|Had already read the book in paperback.  In fact I've read the first four that way and then decided to upgrade to hard cover.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I must say I am impressed by the visual quality of the game as well as the creativity and the fun that comes with this amazing game. Good stuff!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was thrilling exiting not the boring typical book you'd expect. I'm so sad this was the last book! I can't wait for the movie.
B00005O3VC|1.0|Don't buy this because it does not tell you that these disks can only be played in America that i know of, any body buying this product over seas should not buy it because it will not work
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is such fun.  I play this every day and try to beat my best time.  I'm amazed at the record times that have been achieved by other people.<br />The last few days my app has not worked as well.  I can't click on a card to move it.  I have to drag it to the place I want it.  I have deleted the app and reinstalled it twice, but still no luck.  I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 3 stars.<br />Update-the app works for me now by tapping the cards to make them move.  Back to 5 stars!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pretty easy game for my little one.he likes it alot. He likes that you have to wait and build a little like command and concor
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a fascinating book about an interesting woman's journey on the Pacific Crest Trail.  It was equally fascinating concerning her life journey.  She was succesful on both journies.  Geographically, It was a learning experience.  I have been a hiker, but I doubt having the abiity to endure this trip.
0062020897|5.0|Saw the movie years ago but couldn't remember much.<br />Ken Follett is excellent writer.  I grew up in Germany during WWII so found it especially fascinating.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Spectacular...I am hooked on Downton Abbey.  The acting and the story line is superb.  I am totally looking forward to Season 4.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Awesome plot with both human drama and suspense mixed in with totally plausible sci fi, special effects, and action scenes.
B003UD7JEE|3.0|Enjoy this program.  DVD quanlity is very good as is the sound.  Still have not seen the entire series but will continue to watch it.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|We turned this movie off after a half an hour, despite having paid the rental fee for it.  It was just one ugly scene after another, and not fun at all.  Maybe there's a thriller later on, but all there was in the first half hour were scenes of depression and despair.  Horrible.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I was disappointed because the book in the end was pretty depressing rather than an intriguing mystery.  It seemed to delve into physiological issues that were potentially very serious and I wasn't sure but what the references were superficial.  I distrusted the narrator 's (author's) treatment of the &#34;murder gene&#34;, the impact of bullying on teens (which is profound).  The murder of Hope seemed contrived to advance the extreme behavior of Laurie.  In the end all of the characters were unsympathetic, including Andy. The courtroom and grand jury exchanges were interesting and probably realistic, but they became a drag because they went on so long.
B007O40PN2|5.0|It did remind me of Mahler, but it was more uplifting than Mahler usually is.  The brass was great and the performance was well done.
B00BUKZ4O6|5.0|3D was pretty good for a movie not made for it.<br /><br />Viewed on Samsung 7000 series w/Samsung blue ray 3D player
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The beginning was slow,once it pick up the pace, the book sucked me right in. I enjoyed the characters, the story line and the plot.Cant wait fro the movie to come out.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I knew nothing about Nikola Tesla and even less about how electricity works, but I was fascinated by this story and the actions of men whose names I did recognize.  If these events happened (and I have no reason to suspect they didn't), then Thomas Edison was a sleazeball and I need to read more history and biographies.  I appreciate this book's being offered for free.  There's something else out there in the universe to be discovered........I wonder if it's in his papers at the Pentagon.
B007FKI9G0|5.0|Great music on its own, and a wonderfully on-target spoof of 70's big hair arena bands. Nigel Tuffnet is every manager's nightmare.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I do feel the game could have easier energy accessibility to enjoy the game a bit more on a daily basis rather than have to build up for a few days to a week in hopes to push you into spending money, other than that it is very fun.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I certainly don't mind paying for an app that does the job better than a free app.  I haven't found any issues with this app whereas I had lots of problems with the free TWC app.  The data is displayed in a more useful format, it is faster and the radar is more accurate for my small town.
1250007208|5.0|I love the retelling of classic tales and Cinder is toward the top of my list.  Meyer creates a unique and stimulating story line that thrills the reader by weaving in the timeless Cinderella tale.  Scarlet is also incredible and I cannot wait for the next books in this series.  Bravo!!
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|Very up beat. If you haven't seen any of her videos, you should check them out. She should have won AGT.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|You don't even notice you have it on you all day, just let it in the pocket and make the point at the end of the day (or whenever you want to).<br />Really easy to use, very light.<br />Sync is working perfectly and datas are online in a few seconds only.<br />Great with the Body Scale.
B00EE3KMOI|5.0|I decided to watch this show because I am a huge David Tennant fan from when he was on Doctor Who.  After watching just the first five minutes of this show I was hooked.  It really just draws you in.  The acting here is superb.  I really want episode two to air so we can find out more about how an 11 year old boy died.  Was it murder?  An accident  David Tennant and Oliva Colman have great working chemistry together and I can't wait to find out what happens next week.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Enough said. This book is amazing. I have read it multiple times and it is still amazing. Enough said, though.
0425238091|4.0|This could be a very difficult book for those that have not worked in medicine.  It is raunchy and irreverent ... I think<br />most folks don't perceive their physician might actually act this way or have these feelings.  However, if you have<br />ever worked in healthcare especially prior to medicare or health regulations this book rings true.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Good puzzle-game. Start easy enough. Later levels become more difficult and also more fun.<br />There are not enough levels, so this game finished too quickly.<br />Pity love to have more and difficult level
B00E72OKAS|5.0|Awesome game!! Fun upgrade system ! It's mainly mature because you see zombies get knocked in half and sawed up. Lots of blood although it does not look realistic. Incredibly fun, lots o' vehicles and zombies, cool upgrades!!!!! Totally worth the price!!!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Somebody really loved author Mathew Quick's book, and it shows. The film is strong on solid story telling, sharp dialogue, and surprisingly, moments of insight into the slippery world of mental disorder. Apparently Quick brings real world experience to the table (check out his bio) having worked with mentally disabled children. The adapted screen play points to a deeply felt, original voice - somewhere in there.<br /><br />While we get hints of something profound, the film pounds us with plenty to laugh at. Firmly grounded in the world of sports, betting, and (oddly) ball room dancing, this turns out to be a charming, romantic comedy neatly pinned down with acerbic dialogue and feisty, foul-mouthed, characters. What's not to love?<br /><br />Nothing is too messy. Call it a comedy and be done with it because the drama is meek and completely in service of laughs.  But that's OK. We're clearly here to enjoy ourselves at the behest of some colorful characters and a very funny scenario.<br /><br />Cloying-Cuteness Alert. DeNiro plays a crucial supporting role as a life-long neighborhood bookie - but he really needs a vacation from Dad roles. No spoilers here, except to note that his character cozies up to his newly rehabbed son for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, DeNiro hams it up and phones it in, sort of Focker redux. Can't help wondering what a more focused performance might have done for that role.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Amazing.......Cassandra Clare is a true genius she created a world that you can fall Into, just as you are a character. My only complaint is that I can't read the other books fast enough. Read this book and you won't regret it. Even if you don't like the vampire, werewolf, magic thing ( Because I don't!) You will love this series. READ NOW!!! :-)
0345803507|1.0|So I know this series is not from the mind of a literary genius, so I didn't have high expectations, but I couldn't even finish the last one, I ended up sending it to a thrift shop with the other two.  By the third book, I hated the characters.  Christian is a huge ass, and Ana is an idiot.  They deserve each other.  In all honestly, I am probably not in the book's target audience, as this is not the type of book I would normally read.  My husband brought it home to me after a particularly bad day thinking that it might cheer me up.  And surprisingly I did like the first book enough to say, wth, I'll get the other two.  Unfortunately the 2nd book was disappointing and I think I only started the 3rd one in the hopes that it would redeem the second one, but it was even worse.  If you're reading this series for the story, and not just the sex, then don't read past the 1st book, it's just not worth your time.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love this game.  Combines logic and puzzle-solving in a fun package.  Highly recommend and I play over and over again!  Would like to have more levels, the ability to start at the last level played (currently opens to final level since I finished already)  or maybe a random level generator.  Can't wait for more!
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I turned the movie off after 5-10 minutes the killing and blood splatter was so blatant and mind numbing. Do you really want your neurons mirroring all the terribleness?
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like the game but it is very vague in its instructions and hints. I like the dialogue but they get a little wordy. Am anxious to get to the next chapter.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|If I did not like this movie would I have spent the money to add it to my personal collection?? What a piece of biased junk these ratings are! That having been said, this is a good movie for those who enjoy the genre.
B001NA6096|5.0|I had watched Before Sunrise and Before Sunset about 6 years ago and loved them both so immensely. Recently after watching Before Midnight, I just had to revisit Before Sunrise. It was so refreshing to relive the beauty of the conversations and the cinematic poetry of this movie. It starts out like any romantic movie, the girl-and-boy-meet-and-fall-in-love types. Except it is anything but that. It is very romantic (set against some of the most beautiful places in Europe) and yet refuses to use any of the tempting cliches of modern romances ...well, there might be some - but I promise they have been reinvented like never before. Both Ethan and Julie are intelligent actors and add life to the masterful dialogues. I say dialogues but I actually mean very real conversations. They are as thought-provoking as they are beautiful. I can imagine some people who at various points in the movie go &#34; ok, and the point being...?' All I can say to them is - wait and it will all pull itself into one satisfying experience. If it doesn't, then you're probably missing something rather poignant. The movie has inspired me to see my life and relationships through a fresh new pair of eyes.<br />  For those more philosophically inclined, I would highly recommend another less known 'animated' gem of Linklater which is way more experimental in its theme and visual technique (uses a technique called Rotoscoping). The movie is called 'Waking Life'. Celine and Jesse, the main protagonists of the Before trilogy appear for a bit in this movie too.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|A quite interesting view of the East German mentality of spying on every citizen within their reach. It should cause thinking people to pause and reflect. What is the difference between the German Democratic Republic and certain events taking place elsewhere in the world?  Would any other than a totalatarian state, such as the DDR routinely spy on its citizens?  Why? A movie worth watching and considering.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Detailed weather on the go! User friendly,  good graphics an easy to use tool in the Kindle.<br />Thank you AccuWeather!
B009AMAJVO|5.0|This is a awesome movie. the story is fantastic. one of the best revenge films I've seen in a long time. they did a great job making this film. i'm surprised it did not do well in the theaters. it has some of the best acting from colin farell. he did a great job and so did the rest of the actors. this is a really good movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
030014332X|5.0|When I started grad school in philosophy around 1964 Gombrich was already a force to be reckoned with. His recently published Art and Illusion (1960) had re-focused the study of art on the act of perception, and in the dying days of philosophical empiricism, visual perception was a very big deal. Gombrich's work brought psychology, history and philosophy together in an intellectual synthesis that enriched them all and changed - to some extent at least - the way philosophers of my era approached art.<br /><br />A Little History shows the same warm, humane and learned master in a conversation with children - telling human history as a connected human story. As one who has taught Western Civilization for much of my professional life, I was surprised to see how many new insights this little book for children offered. I wish I had it in hand when my son was 9 or 10 and we still had nightly story hour. When I homeschooled him, starting at around that age, Western Civ was one of the great themes of our homebrew curriculum. I wish we had had Professor Gombrich as a companion.
B003N9ASEI|5.0|Where to begin well, I think that this film has to be one of the funniest films about college fraternity life I have ever scene. Forget American Pie and those other college movies, this is the real deal. John Belushi is at his comedic best in this film, and the soundtrack to the film is spectacular. Sure this movie is a little outdated, but trust me, you will love this film. 5/5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so much fun. You have objectives to try to complete. You get achievements to get. And there are daily bonuses! This is a must have app.
B00AEBBAF4|4.0|I saw this film at a movie theatre a while back and I really enjoyed it the first time I saw it. The film has a lot of laugh out loud scenes that will make you cry, and also a lot of explosions for the action guru. The film is very violent and at times grotesque in some scenes as well, so another words  &#34;It's not for the light hearted&#34;. It's a great collection for your video library, and you can see it a hundred times and it won't get old. 4/5 stars.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This  movies is for anyone that likes love stories especially those that can relate to alzheimers or dementia related issues.
B008JFUO36|4.0|thought there was to much romance and not enough action !!  little disappionted, I woill watch again to maybe change my mind
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Angry Birds Rio.<br />Good app, lots of fun to play and entertaining. Grand children love playing it, good for all ages.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Another good book by John Grisham.  I highly recommend it to anyone who like lawyer based stories.  If you don't you'll still love the characters and the story.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Frankl speaks from the most reliable platform of all, self experience. That combined with a formal education and lifelong interest in psychology lay the foundation for one of the best; most meaningful and practical books ever written on the human experience.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel by Garth Nix has always been, and will continue to be, one of my favorite books period, and is the book that started me on my journey through fantasy literature. It follows the journey of a young Sabriel, fresh out of school, and hunting for her father, the Abhorsen. Not only is she unsure of herself and the world around her, she finds herself having to put herself in her father's role, and stand outnumbered against the hordes of the dead.<br /><br />With a snarky not-cat cat companion, Mogget, and a revived forgotten member of the royal family, she sets out to finish her father's job of finding and stopping Kerrigor, a member of the greater dead, and his nefarious plot to break the charter stones and unleash the dead upon the living.<br /><br />Sabriel herself is a strong and realistic heroine that you can't help but cheer for while simultaneously being glad you aren't in her shoes. Touchstone is the perfect knight, and Mogget is the much needed and appreciated comic relief that will have you talking to every white cat you see. Nix creates a fantastic magical world, with characters that will steal your heart, and a plot that will keep you hooked. The bell and charter magic system are one of the most unique I've ever encountered and will have you considering tones and tunes in a different light.<br /><br />Highly recommended for lovers of fantasy both old and new or for people looking for a great gale of fresh air in the fantasy genre. Even over 15 years later it still stands strongly on its own and remains a classic.

0316044695|5.0|great book, arrived quickly. i would recommend this book to anyone. cant wait for the movie to come out. thanks.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I have only seen the first episode (the free one, haha) and would have gobbled up the entire season if money were no object.  This is one of my favorite series, along with White Collar, Lie to Me and Breaking Bad...I can't wait to see the rest of the season.
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|But I loved the first track &#34;Safe and Sound&#34; when I heard it played on our local alternative radio station. Once I got the CD I found I liked a whole lot more including Kangaroo Court - great beat and it's starting to get more play on the radio. Farrah Fawcett Hair feat. Andre 3000 - is turning into my favorite track on the whole CD. I don't know why, the words? The music? All of it is fantastic.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Captivating view of high society in early twentieth century England, and the people who cared for them and helped make their lives so different from those of ordinary folks.  If the stories of the family and their help don't mesmerize you, the beautiful cinematography and location will.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This was a great story which takes you back to pre-Eagles so you can see how it all started.  It wasn't roses all the time with these guys but thay have come back to re-create that special sound that we all remember.  I woud recommend this DVD to any music lover who wants to see this great story.  It will make you laugh, cry and to a greater degree, really appreciate what this band has accomplished.
B008JFUN50|5.0|Elysium is the logical conclusion of a Survival-of-the-Fittest philosophy currently espoused by many Republicans, Tea Party fanatics and the apolitical, super rich. Greed and selfishness is the Law-of-the-Land in Elysium! Don't bother healing the critically ill on Earth with amazing life saving technology. If the sick are not one of the rich and powerful living aboard the giant ocean-liner-in-space then let 'em drop dead in the streets! This is a place where Ayn Rand would be King!<br /><br />Elysium is the ultimate gated community! A wet dream for any rich and powerful person who sees the rest of us as a threat. The corporations and their lackeys in government, the courts and the press literally turn the earth into one giant cesspool and then they get to escape to a corporate utopia in outer space! All I can say is: God help us all!<br /><br />Films like Elysium are a wake-up call to help prevent what might actually happens someday if the course the vast majority of the world is on is not changed!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:081571002X Fortress America: Gated Communities in the United States]] and [[ASIN:0787965162 Smart Communities: How Citizens and Local Leaders Can Use Strategic Thinking to Build a Brighter Future]]

B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved the logic of the game.  very challenging and entertaining. wish there were more rooms in the game. did not want to stop at 10.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|What a voice. What an incredible voice. She has a vast vocal range that grabs you and centers your attention on her voice over everything else. The music is good, the lyrics original and shocking, shocking in a revealing way. I think this album has a timeless quality to it and feel that it will be poplar for decades to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow I mean truly this book was read non stop--I only put it down to eat! 100% worth the buy! It's about katniss becoming the rebel the mockingjay the sign of hope and just the way it is written with action impulse love and even some humor no movie will ever be able to surpass the one you could see and live in your head when you go through word by word, my advice? Buy or rent the entire series before because there is no possible way you could not go crazy wanting to know what happens, even on your second time like me.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Expectations were of a conclusion which did not happen.  The story was too disjointed with too much unneeded background material.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is one of the few quality shows on network television. Smart, clever, well acted and written. Can't wait for more,
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A wonderful read.  I stopped reading King a few years ago but picked this up because the subject intrigued me.  In spite of it being a longer book, I couldn't put it down, and found it a very thought provoking read.  Highly recommend this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app has fantastic graphics and a lot of things to keep it interesting.  every run is a different challenge.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Peter Jackson did a great job with the Lord of the Rings, but that same level of wonderfulness didn't work out quite as well for The Hobbit. In brief:<br /><br />+ If you keep in mind that it's an adaptation of Tolkien's story (or based on his story), then it's a decent story in its own right. But if you think that you're going to watch a movie of the original book, you'll be disappointed at the changes.<br /><br />+ The parts of the screenplay that were added to stretch this short book into three movies can't compare to the quality of Tolkien's work. They're actually pretty bad, and the discrepancy is rather jolting. They worked too hard to give this movie more ties to LOTR than the original book has, and the story doesn't support it very well. And the great white Orc hunting Thorin is just a stupid addition that doesn't enhance the original story.<br /><br />+ I don't know whether it was Peter Jackson's decision or Ian McKellen's, but Gandalf mumbles and mutters most of his lines. I couldn't see the point of that.<br /><br />+ There are several shots that are so over-dramatized that you can only blame it on horrible directing decisions. Two examples are when Thorin turns and faces the camera at the end of Balin's retelling of the battle with the Orcs, and when Gandalf first sees  Galadriel at Rivendell -- it's like she's on some platform that slowly rotates her to face him in an overly dramatic fashion that breaks any realism the movie was trying to sustain. And those aren't the only shots with that kind of problem.<br /><br />Overall I'd like to give the movie 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon doesn't have half stars, I'll go with just 3. I think they would have ended up with a better movie if they had only planned it in two parts instead of being greedy and trying to stretch it to three. We'll have to wait to see how they did on the other two installments.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once I start watching Downton Abbey, I really can't stop until I've watched the whole season.  It is totally additive!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It's fine because it does work. However, I expected a better frame / appearance of the software. It reminded me the first windows versions. But as I said before, it works well.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I have watched it a number of times with family and friends.  Great story.  ALL of the actors and actresses did a fabulous job.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I ONLY NEEDED MY GRANDAUGHTERS HELP ONCE! The perception games were the  hardest. Would love to  play the next one!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|It was a great portrayal of the end of Lincoln's time in office.  It is a gem for historical films.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I am just beginning to understand the concept of ebooks... this book is indeed a good introduction in my desire to know about the ebook platform....
B00003CXBK|5.0|I had heard of this film, and it was recommended to me. It was better than I expected. I highly recommend it.
140006922X|1.0|Reza Aslan's book \\"Zealot\\" -- another \\"know-it-all about-Jesus\\" book, this time by author Aslan engaging in a rather poorly informed guess work on Jesus as an historical and spiritual man.  Aslan has not touched on the most probable view that Jesus would have been a Jewish MYSTIC. If Aslan had any informed knowledge of mysticism, he would have arrived at a different and totally profound understanding of Jesus as a man and a mystic.<br /><br />Read more at: [...] .  Good try at a guess work about Jesus by Aslan, but frightfully ignorant and totally undeserving of publicity.<br /><br />Borrow the book from your local library if you wish to read it out of curiosity, BUT DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY PURCHASING IT (not even your lotto or casino winnings). Ten thumbs down on Aslan's book.
B005RDF2NA|5.0|My kids, granddaughter and I love this movie. Fantastic family movie! This is by far one of the best movies produced!
B004AQR29C|3.0|I felt Stallone needed to let someone else be the love interest & there were question left unanswered throughout the movie.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|its a really fun game but some of the things make no sense but I thought it was really really fun at other times
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love I have 500,000 my brother and I love it I mean I thought it would be bad but it is awesome
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|The very best book I have read in a long time.  From the moment I picked the book up, I could not put it away .  She described so vividly how one must assimilate even at the cost of denying your ethnicity to live in another country.  Great reading!!
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Pollan has done it again!!  Once again I am amazed.  So much to think about, and such wonderful ways to do I.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I really like it. Strong drama and exciting adventures, very beautiful nature, I wonder where is it? I can't wait for the second season
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Everyone should read this thoughtful, well researched book.  How simple was the man called Jesus, son of Mary.  And how wonderful  would the world be if Christians could put aside the political garbage that their religion has collected over the centuries, and relearn his message.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|We bought this for our son and we all watched it.  Cute.  Very well-done animation, and a cute story line.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|It's long! But interesting. I was amazed that the movie had very few main actors, and the play several different parts.  At the end of the movie they show you who play which parts and I was surprised I hadn't recognized the actor.  The movie does move from one time period to another a lot.  I was surprised with the ending.  I enjoy so much I purchased it.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I realize that vampires and werewolves are themes that keep on making the circuit over and over again, but I truly believe this one was just a little bit too much in there for the dollar.  Maybe I wasn't in the proper frame of mind, but it did not appeal to me.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|enjoyed this work very much. the advertising didnot do it justice. so much better than i thought it would be,  and i did think it would be Really good.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|We're always looking for something different to watch, and though we're older and have no children around anymore, sometimes we'll choose a show like this.  It was cute and had a good message.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I binge watched this series during my summer vacation.  I had heard about it but never watched it.  I watched all three seasons all the way through, TWICE! Can't wait  for season four.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|While most movies concerning Lincoln cut straight to the chase and just involve info concerning the Civil War, this show took it to a more personal level.  It uncovered a bit more of Lincoln's personal views about family life.  I did not give it 5 stars because I truly did find it boring.  I have studied, re-studied, watched movies, read books, and just discussed Lincoln so many times, that I am kind of tired of Lincoln!  There's always going to be someone else rehashing every little detail of some famous person's life.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|little corney but super spec effects.  cast is super and action kept me entertained.  Highly recommend for action and story, fun movie
B00190KZUU|5.0|This movie always surprises you, and is extremely enjoyable.  No guns, no blatant sex, no foul language...but it still entertains....amazing.
B008K9UZY4|4.0|So good once you lern how to play it  but the bad thing is because the price is : $2.99 but i still like it.
B007X70NVO|5.0|This doc delivers. A great look at an entire season of MotoGP and what it really is like to be involved in this sport. Highly recommended for anyone interested.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I couldn't stop playing this game! Coin Doser is a great app for those who always wanted to win jackpots at coin pusher without spending a dime! haven't you always wanted to tip those token eating arcade coin pushers but were afraid to tip it and set off that alarm? now you have a 'shake ' feature on this app that when charged,  shakes the coins into the slot!  cool app cool gameplay my only critique is why would. they advertise coindozer on the game coindozer? :/ still a fun way to keep boredom away :)
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam is hilarious in the way she describes a seriously actionable life changing system. Highly recommended - i bought a copy for my whole family and emailed it to them
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Turtle Beach headsets are the best, I've tried others when my other PX21 went out but the sound quality wasn't as good as these are....you can't go wrong with these.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy and I certainly wanted a conclusion but I guess I was just kind of tired of the whole thing by the time I got finished.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is very addictive. Something to do while waiting on someone to play their turn in my online games.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Android needs a file explorer type system, and ES works just fine.  If you don't know what a &#34;File Explorer&#34; is - it's like Windows Explorer, or Mac OS X's Finder - it is the thing you look at when you go to a folder to open a file.  Android doesn't have one by default, but this app fills that gap.
B009GESJH2|5.0|This CD will make you want to dance, sing from the top of your lungs and smile while you do it... Great music and a great cd
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game! Keeps you busy solving the mystery. Just wish all the games like this lasted longer...a lot longer! Lots of fun!
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I love this CD... I can listen to it over and over and hear something new every time... Highly recommend
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I am hooked, this game is a blast. I still have plenty of money to buy clubs, not sure yet if it runs out.
B0094M2X6Y|4.0|If you are a JRB fan enjoy the trip to the red planet. It would be great to find out a few more of his novels were going to follow but I doubt it. Well scripted, acted and the fx were great. The supporting cast did a wonderful job - especially JC's lawyer at the beginning. Willa the monster dog was a treasure as well.
B005HE5J7I|4.0|Having been to London in April 2012, this book was a nice reminder of that trip. Unfortunately for me I was beginning to show the early stages of bladder cancer which has since been treated and hopefully killed.  We plan to go back in 2014.<br />My wife and I agree that we'd love to live in London or England for a year or more.  As retired teachers I'm certain we could offer the schools there a great deal while we were also learning.
B004K58GSO|5.0|Pay attention to how long at the start there is NO dialog yet you can tell exactly what is being communicated. That don't and haven't made them like this anymore.
B000B5IPDI|5.0|you will really like this film which is basically an old man telling a young man huge lies about his life....but-they almost seem true. YOU must buy it-and see!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I downloaded this app for my grandson who absolutely loves it!!!  I can hardly get my Kindle to read my book!
B00A1AU702|1.0|Bought this cujo blue-Ray twice. Returned both. Both discs started out with sound. No sound at all after you got to the main menu screen. Very disappointed. I ended up buying it a third time on regular DVD. Not problems with that one.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|A great movie. Had to watch it twice to get the full impact. Thought the star of the movie was Billy Connoly rather than Maggie Smith,<br />but all in all a great movie.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like this update the wallpapers the prizes will of that stuff is good even the layout.<br />The only thing they left out would be the Ultraviolet Radiation for your location.<br />Please make new update and fix this. I need to know UV levels
B000OJFV4C|4.0|Once you get into watching The Tudors, it seems that Tudor madness takes over.  Not entirely accurate so it causes me to stop and check the facts, but it is an overall very good series.
B005HED11Y|4.0|its old but if you give it a chance it gets better i really didn't start to like it till eps 14 it get much better after that.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Enjoyed this mystery, with P. D. James usual plot complexity and excellent writing.  As Austen fan fiction, it was true to the characters - their actions and words and feelings seemed an accurate extension of the characters Austen imagined.  In addition, the portrayal of the legal system in the countryside and then in London at that time was fascinating.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is much fun!  I love  all the dragons and how much fun it is to see their next form.  By the way add me I'm Toga88
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After using the mouse for a couple weeks I cannot imagine returning to my old Razer DeathAdder mouse. Anker has created a solid product, keeping in mind ergonomics and using materials that feel durable and comfortable. The layout of the buttons on the mouse is excellent, with only needing slight movements to reach to the next button. I have yet to find myself pressing a button that I did not intend to. The different DPI settings, depending on how you map your layout, can be controlled with presses to the button for quick adjustments to react to a variety of situations within your game. The mouse comes with a profile button located on the bottom that I utilize to switch from 'browsing' mode where I have the DPI settings mapped lower to 'gaming' mode where it is adjusted to higher DPI.<br />Downloading the software allows for changing the layout that I brought up above. It allows for different mapping of the buttons and changing the lighting on the mouse. I really only use the lighting to change the color of the logo to visually determine which 'mode' I'm in in case I forget.<br /><br />I suppose the only complaint I have is a lack of buttons on the right side of the mouse that I could use with my fourth or fifth digit, and the Anker logo being covered up by my palm.<br /><br />For the price and quality of the mouse, you will not be disappointed.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this is one of the best Moba style games ever on android. A must download and it is very easy to play.
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|She is one of the best new singers.  I promise you will not be disappointed. What a beautiful voice -- a little of Sarah Vaughn and Billy Holliday!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Nice graphics and storyline. No bugs or problems with this game at all. Would definitely recommend for anyone who likes to solve puzzles, etc...
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I love the game. The only problem I had with it was that it never saved when you are in the middle of a level. Other than that, it is a wonderful app. It's worth the money.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I downloaded it yesterday. It was cool for the first few mins. Then it crashed.<br />It's free but not worth it.
B009R659L8|5.0|I was very intrigued with the story line. Loved the ending. Didn't see it coming. Glad it came out as it did.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|pity the movie wrecked the book.  For once a zombie story that focusses on the big picture.  I would highly recommend this book
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I have to admit that I was confused for most of the book.  About the time I was into the story and anxious about learning more about these specific characters, the setting would change, all new characters and I just never knew where the story was going next.  I loved his first 2 books so I was very disappointed.
B00CVDM8QS|5.0|the best way to undetstand the state of art of astronomy<br /><br />if every one understand the content of this book, the mankind will be better<br />it put us to understand the meaning of  the religion : NOTHING !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like temple run and the despicable me minions then you will love the game minion rush. When I got the app I didn't know if it would just be a bad version of temple run. But once I played it, I knew it was an awesome game. I would recommend this game if your bored because it is so addictive. You should get it.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Sometimes it's a little hard with moving left and right. It's awesome and fun to play times are a little hard to get but lots of good times
B008ASGP3U|5.0|This is a character worth putting back to work. The detail the pace all ring true. He may not be a role model but Denis is a keeper.
B008CLI4N4|1.0|On Season one disk one there were meant to be 2 episodes on the same disk. In fact either there is only 1, the first, or the menu system does not allow access. Also the bootup time is the longest I have ever experienced. This was when I tried playing on a sony bd player. I then tried it using vlm player on my computer with the exact same result. I will not be bothering with further disks in this series as there are easier shows to watch. Like others, I was tempted to pirate it but don't want to risk my isp refusing future service, but I certainly understand why people do it!
B00932A4XE|5.0|made me laugh until i could not stand it any more. highly recommend it.<br />they really should make a part 2.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|After reading the 3rd, 4th & 5th books in the series-I now know the Sidney Australia adventure that the other books referred to.  Redbreast must have been the best-selling book in the series in Norway to be published first in the U.S.  Either way-either order-Harry Hole always solves the case through some of the most horrendous situations and drunken stupors-the poor bastard always ends up on top!  Do yourself a favor and read this series.
B008JFUO36|3.0|The best of standalone Tom Cruise has all been sci-fi in the last 10 years. Think about it. Ignore MI, which is a franchise. Now we are left with a string of hit-or-miss movies featuring old man Cruise struggling to look 25 after thousands of dollars invested in plastic surgery. Starting with Minority Report and continuing with War of the Worlds, Cruise has evolved into a sci-fi icon of sorts, very much like latter-day Charlton Heston. With Oblivion, which is essentially Top Gun plus 100 years of high-tech breakthroughs, the actor has come full circle.<br /><br />The SFX are what you would expect from a movie with a $120M budget and two A-list stars. A visually stunning earth home that sits right above the clouds is where most of the melodrama takes place. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and surrogate wife Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) exchange smooches, awkward glances, and plenty of scenery chewing dialogue before Julia (Olga Kurylenko) intrudes to form one dysfunctional love triangle. At this point, I could only hope that Jack would throw Victoria off the side of their home in a sort of futuristic nod to Captain Stabbin, but the soon-to-be ex-surrogate wife is dispatched via droid instead.<br /><br />Gaping logical flaws abound. Again, the home that is the setting for 2/3 of this film is situated above the clouds. With no guard rails. What if a strong gust of wind came and dragged one of the main characters off of the improbable structure? Also, I am pretty sure that in the next century, Earth's Stratosphere will still be pretty freaking cold! The surrogate couple swim around butt naked in their attached pool, while the accompanying outdoor temperature is likely below -60*F. Ice skating in Eskimo gear would be more reasonable.<br /><br />There is some business with clones that I could not understand. Morgan Freeman fails to impress. Olga keeps her shirt on. Combine Moon and Prometheus and you will arrive at Oblivion, which is ultimately too milquetoast to leave a lasting impression. This is \\"conservative\\" sci-fi. Nice haircuts, just-ironed uniforms, and staunch patriotism give off a Jetsons vibe. But the overall flick carries as much depth as a puddle, which does not make for good post-apocalyptic cinema.lasting impression. This is \\"conservative\\" sci-fi.

B004PR71JC|5.0|If you love the movie then you will just love the CD.  You will be up moving and grooving! It is hard not to dance along with music. Great sound quality!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great read! Can't believe it's over already. Ready for book six to come out already! Hopefully it won't be too long!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great story, very complex, with an interesting cast of characters that you will either care for or hate, but not be indifferent about!  While this has similiarities to other scifi stories I've read, it is unique enough to hold your attention, answering some of the inevitable questions that arise but leaving plenty of room to learn more about this unique silo world that isn't answered in this omnibus edition.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|canna getafoo do be do!!!  Betta papoy nev befoun!  translation:  cannot get enough of this game.  best papoy to come to the cloud.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I can't stop playing. This game is really fun to play. It has started to hurt my thumb though, o well it's worth it.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I was thrilled that the movie didn't deviate from the book which I also enjoyed. Both my husband and I have watched the movie more than once and thoroughly enjoyed the storyline.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I could,  and have,  watched Downton all day long.  It gives a window,  albeit rose colored, into a past long since lost. I can't wait for season four!
B00CNX4YMM|5.0|It is just fun Rock! Enjoy! The group has a lot of different sounds. And keep the amps running hot! Great sound for party's.  For those about to Rock!!! This group keeps it rocking!
076115728X|5.0|This is one of the best books written about turning mistakes into opportunities. No, that's wrong; it's about seeing what is possible. I think it should be given to every new parent and should be read daily to children everywhere. If you've ever heard Sir Ken Robinson speak about what happens to children and their creativity once it is pounded out of them, there is a cure and this book is it.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Interesting man to read about.  I enjoyed the book. Jobs was the kind of character that might not have been believable in fiction...
B00C4GRGQY|4.0|Read it. Applicable no matter your experience level. It will help you become a better photographer. Neil van Niekerk is a very readable author with knowledge and experience in the field. If you want to make a portrait you can be proud of, this is your guide.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|WhenI got the movie I was so anxious to watch it  but about !/2 way through it started to pixilate ???????????? and then freeze. I took it to a place that polished dvd's  They said it looked like it was already polished it was so perfect. We had them polish it again. Have yet to watch it again
B00821OX98|5.0|Very interesting series, and as an added bonus, I love all of the early American history references; everyday American citizens banding together to fight a superior invading force....except these are aliens not redcoats!
B005HED11Y|5.0|I really like this show!  Love the arguments between Spock and Bones.  There are a couple of episodes that I didn't care for too much, but it is still a great season!
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Out of all the Star Gate series (except possibly the first movie) this one showed more integrity that all the rest. I will never understand why it got canceled but if anyone knows and can enlighten me... please do.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Historical interest. Great acting with well chosen cast. The number of people employed to run the estate, their positions and the hierarchy required to keep order is a real lesson of the time. The information on the setting was very interesting and educational.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Great plot, great characters. I even had my husband asking me what happens next? It would make a terrific movie.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Nice book. Felt like a lesson in life and career. Would try to apply some of his ideas in my career.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This program is a great escape to the asritocraic times. I'm addicted and can't wait for the next season.<br />Awesome.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Lots of levels makes this game last a couple of days.  Nice graphics with great sound.  It will keep your attention.
B000XWJMGS|5.0|When replacing hardware, I don't like to mess around with suspect quality.  This family of connector is super easy to work with, quite rugged, and well designed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I never use to care much for &#34;period pieces,&#34; but my daughters told me that I'd love it, and they were right.  I found every aspect of this show of the highest quality, and it has pulled me in from the very first season episode.  I absolutely LOVE the actors, the characters, the  writing, the story, the scenes, the props, the beauty of the homes, as well as the landscape, not to mention the beautiful accents.  I've never had the desire to travel outside of the USA, with the possible exception of the UK, as my ancestors are all an American mix of Scottish, Welsh, Irish, and English, but I now find myself wanting to book a trip to the UK as something on my bucket list!  Each season gets better!  I can't wait until January 2014 for the 4th season!
B0095GSKDE|5.0|I have read other Gladwell efforts, and appreciate this work as well.  His research and voice are entertaining and informative.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|love the box set but somtimes it's good to wait<br />when i first saw the box set it was over fifty dollars so i passed on it<br />saw it drop to thirysomething bucks forgot to order<br />saw it for around twenty got it ....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife wanted to watch it and we never seen the show. It was just fininshing up the 3rd year. and was able to catch season 1,2,3 on PBS.Was not sure what to expect and after the first show was hooked. in one sense very fast setting as in day time soaps some one just found out that she was pregnant it would take two years to have the baby. as in downton it only took one show.<br />Love all the people on the show, the lord , and lady. the daughters, and the servants. One you just have to love..is grand mama. Can't wait for the new season to start. Watch it, you'll enjoy it.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|i haven't finished the mg3 but i shall be working on it for the years thats come. the book is nice
0345529057|5.0|This is an epic saga full of rich plot lines, similar to Tolkien.  But unlike Tolkien, George R.R. Martin doesn't spend pages describing the field of grass!  There are multiple story threads that intertwine, and each chapter is told from a different character's point of view, so you get different perspectives on things going on in the same timeline.  My only real disappointment so far (other than some characters I really liked being killed off... sigh!) is that the series starts with talking about &#34;The Others&#34;, and alludes to a lot of magic, but so far (quarter of the way through book 3), there is only a little magic, and &#34;The Others&#34; still haven't shown up.  Hmmmm.  Still... I'm sucked into it!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I enjoy it most of the time. I get annoyed sometimes with its automatic insertions, but overall it saves me time with suggestions.
B003G4W49C|5.0|simply the moast enjoyable book i have ever read. maybe not the most complex or indepth... but enjoyable . the central character connects to most pekple. a great story of humanity and our shortcomings. a must for all and an absolute for geeks and sci fi fans.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|A wonderful book. The movie could have been closer to the book, but it still did the book justice. If you like the movie, you'll love the book.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|A typical movie that was made for those who enjoy action and dark humor. This movie had so many unbelievable scenes that you had to watch the entire movie just to see how many more unbelievable scenes  were on the way.  If this movie had a story line or a plot.  Pure entertainment .
B00BU18U82|1.0|Pay for the game, and they are still greedy enough to charge $1.30 just to unlock each single piece of equipment you'll need (and you'll need a lot).  Rip off city.
B001AMNL2Q|3.0|While Full Metal Jacket was a good escapist movie it was a over the top portrayal of the Marine Corps in the mid-1960s.  Some of the scenes were fairly accurate while many others were not accurate.  An example of the inaccuracies is the sub-story of the fat recruit.  This recruit would not have remained with the other recruits in his platoon he would have been reassigned to the Physical Conditioning Platoon to either shape up or he would have been discharged or given one more chance by being sent to motivation platoon.  The battle scenes in the fight for Hue City was a made for the movies inaccurate and exaggeration of the actual events of that battle.  I enlisted, or rather volunteered, for the Marine Corps in August of 1966, was a Marine Rifleman when I went to Vietnam from August 1967 through September of 1968 and will never forget Boot Camp and my tour in Vietnam as a Grunt.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|You should really just go ahead and give them your money. This show is definitely worth it. So just click purchase.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I have always enjoyed this game. Reminds me of playing it as a kid with my brothers and sister! Thanks for making it available on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Great music, some Lps of the music from Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush I have then in boxes along with other<br />great bands.<br /><br />Recommended, Frank Marino is a Classic, great musician and composer, the band is incredible plus the arrangements and creativity.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000002UWF|5.0|I was asked to order this CD on the request of my father in law, and he has been listening to it for weeks.  At the end I put 5 stars because he loves it, as it probably reminds him when he was younger.  Louis Prima in his time was quite famous as a jazz trumpet player (he had also studied violin), singer, dancer (he was called the King of Swingers), actor etc. He also gave his voice to the King Louie in the Book of the Jungle Disney movie. He is also famous for having re-interpreted the song &#34;I' am just a gigolo&#34;. Even if I listen to bands that are far away from his style (Boards of Canada, Autechre, etc.), let say that Prima had a gift for melodies and a great sense of rhythm. To make your own opinion, you still can listen to him on Deezer for example.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I can't figure why people think this is a great movie.  I found it poor lighting poor sound and boring dialog.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I really enjoy this game. The graphics and the play are awesome. It is definitely a favorite way to kill some time. Be prepared to slog through levels if you don't want to spend a bunch of cash. My characters have been reset to level 1 twice( both were level 30+). The game locks up and I have to reinstall. I made the mistake of paying for some extra stuff and poof that's gone! It's a free game, so I ain't mad, but I'm a little frustrated to start over. The $10 or so bucks I lost on my characters are the price I paid. From now on I'll just slug it out, and not buy more, cause it's gone when the game locks up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game for all ages. its addicting and its fun.i would recomend this to all my friends. i could play this for hours on end.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks comes through again!  I haven't seen the movie version but don't want to now that I've read his book!  Very warm story that develops nicely.  Hard to put down.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Law of attraction:  ASK - BELIEVE - RECEIVE!!!  To know we have had the power to change our lives right in front of us and never knew it, fathoms me!  Be thankful for everything, every moment and LOVE!  Love all that surrounds you.....feel the gratitude you have for all those things, people, places that you love!  Thank you, Rhonda Byrne for bringing this powerful tool to my computer!  Thank you universe for my health, my wealth and my relationships!  Thank you universe for me!!
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|sleek, elegant, easy to use. Fits perfectly, nice zipper, sturdy, attractive. No bells and whistles - just the basic function of protecting the kindle.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Bought this to use with The Netflix app on my iPhone. It worked for a few days. Now it plays for 4 or 6 seconds, then mysteriously pauses so I have to hit play again. Kind of defeats the purpose if I have to keep hitting play. I've tried two different iPhones and an iPad, same results. Another crappy product from Google.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|How do I get Ben to talk to or repeat me? I love this game it is awesome!  What is Ben even drinking
B003V4AK8E|2.0|While I did find the controller's shape and design close to that of the Xbox 360's, the dead zones in the analog sticks made the controller inaccurate, clunky, and frustrating to use.  Unfortunately not worth the seemingly reasonable price.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I really like this app. I don't have to argue about the rules with my friends but i am also playing with real people.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I have been reading the Reacher books that Lee Childs has written, in the order that they were written. I have found that they captor your attention and you can't put them down. Every one that I have read had a great story and kept you guessing through the whole book.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|It made me laugh and cry and sing  I feel so bad for Barry all of his brothers are gone.  Nothing is ever mentioned of his older sister.  I think this is something everyone should have ~ I know they got a lot of crap with the Disco stuff and then Andy at the same time but listen to the poetry and fantastic music arrangements to older songs and new.  Great  Fanny & I Started a Joke are 2 of my favorites.
0375842209|5.0|I'm really liking this book. It is grim because it is about a small German village during WW 2. The story centers around a young girl living with a foster family and the issues of life in Germany among the those who had to follow Hitler's government.  The family is hiding a Jewish man in their basement  which also adds to the complexity of the story.The narrator of the story is Death so the story is told from his POV.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has written the type of fiction I most enjoy - a complex story with just enough mystery and twists to keep me thinking long after I have finished the last page about &#34;What if...?&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun I love it its good for kids to even on the road it's all my nephew plays and it is free
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read it all the way through since I read the first 2. At times, it was a little hard to press on. It's ok for a young adult book. I bet the movies will be better though.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It`s true, at first I didn't think much of the game. they I played a couple of rounds.  Very fun and I like that you can upgrade.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It works just as well as it does on my PC and better than my Kindle.  Perfect for any tablet.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Lots of good action, good effects, good soundtrack, good story with a little twist but it was slow and I found myself wandering of to do other things for a while and then coming back to it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Quite a fun game. Wish there were a few more rooms but definately worth a try. Good for brain action. Can't wait for them to add more rooms.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Fun to play. It's just like playing the real thing. You can play by yourself or with other people. Enjoyed playing.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I was alittle bit upset when I downloaded the basic app and found that you could only look over the features but not try it out. However, once I downloaded the upgrade, I have been very happy with it. I have now be able to flawlessly download and update all of the documents that I want to on both my iPad and my Kindle Fire. Trust this app!
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and I enjoy watching the show together! We like the suspense of not knowing exactly what is going to happen next.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am loving it. I have only had it a few hours but I am having loads of fun.<br />I wish I could adjust the sensitivity on it is about all I have found I would change.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I recommended this book to my friends on Facebook. Once you begin reading you can't put it down! Before I finished Wool I purchased the second book in the series. I wanted to buy the third book, Dust, today because I plan to finish Shift tomorrow. I am not sure I can wait a week for Dust to be released! The author has a great imagination! The characters are believable. I like the strong women in the books.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I hesitated to continue when I first began this book, And put it away because I thought the sadness would be more than I could bear.  I picked it up again months later, And I'm so glad that I did.  Sad at times, yes, But the author is gentle with the reader's feelings...
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This really keeps the interest going and it was just the right length. My only complaint was how it ran you all over for just one thing. The solutions took a bit of thinking but it was only a matter of taking a sec. I'm delighted there is a follow-up!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a deep, thought-provoking, emotion-wrenching piece of literature. John Green totally appealed to my literary senses.
B0044XV3R8|2.0|James Cameron's Avatar is probably one of the most overrated movies of the last decade.  Avatar is the textbook definition of style over substance.  The film is cool visuals and decent action and that is all.  The film has no interesting characters, the villains are all comical stereotypes with no dimension at all, and it is predictable from beginning to end.  The plot of this film has been done to death in tons of other films, so there are no surprises.  This film does not deserve to be the highest grossing film ever.  Plus the film is way too long.  Many scenes could have been cut and it would have been the same movie.<br /><br />The biggest problem is the plot, which is extremely predictable.  From the first ten minutes I could guess how the film would play out and I was right.  The plot is basically the plot of Dances with Wolves but with aliens instead of Native Americans.  You have a soldier who is hired to drive the natives off the land.  However, as the film goes on he befriends the natives and learns of their culture.  Eventually he joins the natives and fights his own people.  I would not be so upset if they just took a few elements from Dances with Wolves.  However, Avatar is Dances with Wolves, just with aliens.  There is almost no difference at all.<br /><br />What's worse is that the characters are really lame.  Sam Worthington's character is generic and not interesting at all.  Sam Worthington does not do a horrible job performance wise, but half of the time he looks like he is ready for lunch.  His character is the stereotypical good guy and the fish-out-of-water.  He is also kind of an idiot.  For example, that scene when he first is transferred into the avatar body and has legs is cringe-worthy and goes on for too long.  He just behaves like a little kid that got his new toy.  The supporting characters are boring as well.  Many of them are just devices used to move the plot along like Michelle Rodriguez's character.  Sigourney Weaver is in this too.  She does fine but she cannot save the cast.<br /><br />The villains are even worse.  They are unbelievable stereotypical and one-dimensional.  One of the villains played by Giovanni Ribisi is just the stereotypical rich guy who only cares about money.  The other big villain played by Stephen Lang is the over-the-top one-dimensional general who wants to destroy the Navi civilization for no other reason than he is the bad guy of the movie.  These seem more like Captain Planet villains than ones you would see in a supposedly adult film like this.<br /><br />It is a shame because James Cameron used to know how to write good characters.  He wrote Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Hudson from Aliens.  He also created iconic characters like Sarah Connor and John Connor from Terminator.  Cameron could also write good villains like the T-1000 from Terminator 2 or Burk from Aliens.  Now he seems to care more for the effects and the spectacle of a movie rather than the story and character.  With both this and Titanic before Cameron has given us oversimplified characters that are mostly there for forced drama and/or to drive home a message that you see on countless after school specials.  He had fifteen years to work on Avatar, so there is no excuse for a predictable story and bland characters like what we have here.  He obviously cared more about making the effects look amazing (which they do) and the story and characters were just an afterthought.<br /><br />There are good things about the film.  The effects look amazing.  Pandora is very colorful, unique, and pleasing to the eye.  I have not seen it in 3D, but I heard that it was pretty good.  It also has some decent action, particularly at the end with the final battle.  Many people who defend this movie say that it is more about the experience of being on Pandora.  Yes, it is a good experience in the theater, but that does not mean that the film is good.<br /><br />A film needs more than spectacle to be good.  There are lots offilms where I had a good experience watching the film in theaters, but as I thought about it more and watched it again at home I find that the film is not that good.  X-men Origins Wolverine is a film that quickly comes to mind.  I did not even have that great of an experience watching it in the theater actually.  It was fun to look at, but the story and characters were too bland for me, and I was just bored.  I found this to be a very boring movie.<br /><br />Overall, if you want to sit through two hours and forty minutes of eye candy then by all means see the film, although most people have seen the film by now.  I personally, found Avatar to be an extremely long, predictable, simplistic, boring movie.
1400034779|5.0|This is the first book in a series. The characters are interesting and funny. Googling the places, animals, and insects mentioned brings everything to life. Every book in this series leaves me wanting to read more about Precious and the cases she attempts to solve.
B00499NHLC|5.0|If you've ever read the books the stories are familiar. I absolutely love the modern adaptation of Sherlock and Dr Watson. I wish they would make hundreds of these!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Excellent, and we are going to see them live in Nov.  The documentary is arranged well and produced well.  I grew up with this band and it is one of my favorites.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the musical and loved the music so when I was looking for the CD amazon had what I wanted at a great price
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Just listening to the lyrics alone will have you believing in this MC!!! He will be one of the greats to bring HIP- HOP to a new era. I feel pride when I her this dude flow lyrics and create artistic montages.  Guaranteed, one of Terry Sanford's Finest lyricist will make a lasting impression on the industry.<br /><br />NC STAND UP!!! J. Cole is real!!!
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements when introduced to me in 2004 by my daughter was one of the most supportive and life changing experiences of my life.<br />I found the book to be an easy read with profound messages for identifying non supportive behaviour and ways to change for a more sustainable relationship with myself and others.<br />I have since recommended this book and others by this author to many people.<br />In this instance I purchased 2 copies to gift to selected participants in a workshop presentation I was delivering on. Work Life Balance.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very helpful and now I know what to do!!! I can't wait to publish my first book very soon here I will be published...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My kindle was full so I put it to the cloud. Boy was I in trouble. So I am equally as happy that the cloud was there. Kids happy that is the great part.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great game! It is really realistic. I highly suggest it for all those horse lovers out there.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I loved it !! Diana Krall is one of my favorites. I had the rare opportunity to meet her.I have many of her C.D.s.
B008JFUNYG|2.0|characters gotta be smarter.  I know it's part of the genre to make them idiots but just cannot care about characters who appear in modern attire and act like 21st century people, but behave as if they've never seen a horror film.  movie doesn't have to be tongue in cheek, but would be great if characters had an iota of self-preservation.  as presented one wonders how any of them survived to adulthood.  stupid characters are one feature horror film writers should work harder to avoid.  one and a half stars mostly due to competent acting, and movie is well shot.<br /><br />P.S. Totally, and I mean 100% unbelievable, that a group of 20 somethings, with obviously more than minimum resources, would go out into the woods to sleep in a decrepit shack, no matter what the reason.  I could see this group going to a remote, nice cabin, but not to something that looks condemned, and without anyone complaining.  And there's electricity and running water (how does that happen in a remote/abandoned cabin), clean rug on the floor (who cleans the place).  Set designer did not do the best job; there should have been dust and grime everywhere (there looked to be a handwritten diary with pristine pages, not even yellowed with age - maybe one of the characters brought it with them, maybe I just missed that).  the writer missed a great opportunity to connect with the audience by not having characters discuss it; I mean, having them being put to work and complaining would have worked, but no cobwebs, no mice (in the middle of the forest), not believable.  I know the lead was kicking the habit, not strong enough plot point or well enough presented in the story to have characters remain there.  this group would have retired post-haste to the nearest Holiday Inn, drug habit or no drug habit (and I know writer was pushing that they were there for the heroine, but he didn't craft his story well enough, should have had at least one character mutter something alluding to the sacrifice her friends were making by staying in such a dump).  I could not get past the location, so that means I couldn't connect at all with characters who made progressively dumber mistakes (like looking at a demon book that clearly said do not read this).  The whole film I rolled my eyes.  I don't think impatience and exasperation were the primary reactions the film makers were hoping for, but even with an open mind, that was the best I could do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'd given up on the show after the live broadcast  Season 2. I was wary of watching any more glorification of the English class system. I was persuaded to pick it up again with Season 3 and I have been transfixed by the quality of the writing and the exploration of many themes that came into play as the C20th century progressed. In short, the class system was presented with many of its various vicissitudes. That made it philosophically acceptable for me!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Not for casual entertainment, have to watch the story line closely but it has a pretty good ending.  Not for the kiddies.
B005ES0XQY|5.0|bought for husband he normally wears a 10 1/2 so bought these in 11 he says a little big but not bad

B0070YDOT8|1.0|Played  on  My kindle 7\\" & all the challenges don't work. But liked to play with their coins. Then got a kindle 8.9 played for a month  with no problem, challenges worked good but play area was really small. A couple of days ago they changed it to full size now can't play. It closes on the slot games . Tried to uninstall then reinstall  and didn't help. Untill I can play slots again 1star. If anyone knows how to fix pls  leave instructions here. Thanks.

B00D4FDNIO|5.0|This album is awesome. The fusion of vocals and sounds it's hard to describe but easy to fall in love with. It's kinda like dj meets dance meets soul. This album has a great feel to it and I highly recommend it.
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I^ve read. I have recommended it to several of my friends. Great reading!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I must admit to being skeptical of this series when my daughter recommended it, but I have been drawn into the stories and have even come to care about what happens to the characters--even the ones that aren't very likable at first.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. It is fun and challenging friends is a good way to keep it exciting. There is always something new yo explore. If you like the movie and the Temple run game you will like this game too.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I love this game but it only has 10 levels. I was really into the game and then it ended. Really it ends before it begins.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|watched the first one years ago and fell in love with the characters. they are so mismatched. glad to have all four movies to enjoy.
B009R659L8|5.0|How can you put a book down like this one?  The ending was so shocking.  Thank you Mary Higgins Clark.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I will start off by saying that I absolutely love Neil Gaiman. He is one of the few authors left with books that I can never put down. This was an excellent read, and if it were to be downgraded it would be by the fact that it was just too short. Picked it up and read it in a day. This was partly due to the length of the book and more really due to becoming enrapt in the story and being unable to put it down. The story telling in this novel is excellent, as always with Gaiman, and I promise it something anyone can pick up and enjoy. I will ruin nothing for all those out there who have somehow not bought this yet, just please buy this book, and any other Gaiman and prepare yourselves for a master of the art of the story.
B001N4OX82|4.0|I love the convenience of being able to stream movies on my laptop from Amazon and Troy was an epic movie!

B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Always liked Hootie and the Blowfish, but never imagined that Darius Rucker would give us a voice like this.  It is truly unique.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I bought this for my husband but the whole family loves it. Gorgeous singing and haunting melodies. Recommended for fans of Florence & the Machine.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a great, light-hearted movie with beautiful songs that my daughter and I both enjoy watching! Love the characters!
B00A27X972|3.0|It was very difficult to get into.  The reason I kept reading on, was because someone said it would get better.  It took about half way through before I  realized I was enjoying it.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|This was a cute movie--parts of it were a little weird, or maybe just kind of a downer, but overall my daughter and I enjoyed watching it, and enjoyed the songs.
B002BRRTUO|3.0|This campy 1980's movie is entertaining, full of old school movie magic and fabulous costumes. The one thing that I did not like was.the rigid gender rolls. But these are to be expected in a hollywood movie. As a period piece this is movie is entertaining and fun.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|We enjoyed this movie quite a bit, though it was hard to follow at places. The movie leaves the impression that there is a lot from the book that's left out (out of necessity--the book is quite long!) I felt like the acting was good, though, and would recommend it.
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|I hated this movie.  I knew it was based on a true story but it was not at all good.  Don't waste your time and money
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|There are not enough stars to properly rate this book for me, I think it is the most wonderful book I have ever read.<br />This is such a beautiful family. The characters come totally to life for me and I want to be as amazing a mother as she is. It left me with a wonderful warm feeling about life and relationships.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really a fast paced show, the lawyers are so quick with their lines.  Love the three characters - Harvey, Mike, and Louis
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A terrific tool with all sorts of helpful options including various Bible translations and countless reading plans, a daily Bible verse, suggested reading for the day, space for notes and the option to interact wtih others. Something here for everyone who wants to take their Bible reading seriously and to grow and learn, at whatever level. Easy to use.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Wife and I had a fun time watching this family movie. We will have to go see the sequel soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging game.  Love it. Wish there were more levels. Could spend hours playing a game like this every night with family.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|With 3 free months of Netflix for my existing Netflix account I couldn't resist. The setup was easy, and I don't have any complaints with how it works. It's a novelty item for our household and will probably end up being taken to the office to project from any of multiple laptops to a TV. I can see it being very useful in an office setting so anyone at a meeting can send their screen to the TV without any cables.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is, well, dark.  However, it kept me enthralled and turning those pages long after bedtime.<br />Gillian Flynn does not dissapoint.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|I would prefer a zen mode where there is no time. I'm too stressed already. I can't play this. I'll have to pass on this game.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Listened all the way to concert...listened all the way home to them. I never get tired. They are incredible. I can listen all day....AND all night
0307702103|5.0|This is a great book and I love the audio books for driving on long trips.  I love John Grisham.  Amazon service is great and I shop there all the time.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Not since 'Forbidden Planet' has the potential power of the mind been so amazing, and since 'The Ghost in the Shell' has consciousness been in such debate.  Inception takes what could be, maybe even what might be, and begs the question of whether it should be, and is it heaven or hell.<br />Fast paced and thoroughly entertaining with special effects on a completely different level, and more plot twists more reminiscent of a rollercoaster ride.  Plan on buying it because you will want to see it more than once to catch what you missed.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Totally enjoyed Beverly Hills 90210 on my iPad while in a rehab after Total Knee Replacement surgery.  Took my mind off the pain of physical therapy.  Watched the whole series.  Would like to see a continuation of the move back to Minneapolis in the future.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Anyone who has aerd other books about the King of Pop should read this one, I think this is probably the true account by the most honest people his friend and body guards, and knew him the best.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I've always liked the Eagles from the very beginning.  Their DVD History gave me information and insights into individual band members.  I have tickets for an Eagles concert in Seattle on September  4  Yeah Me!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easier to read than phone alarm,  quick setup. Like the options available. _Hope to see more sounds in future updates.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I had a little marathon,watching this series. It did not disappoint ! A good price. I would deal again. Chilling!
B004X6PRO6|1.0|Decided to venture into something newer.  I am most comfortable in the classics.  Found the foul language too oppressive for me and put the book don early.  Just not worth my time!
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|Fastest speed I've seen. The kindle works wonders while playing the movie. It's amazing fun for young and old alike!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Good, but certainly not great.  I did enjoy the circles that were drawn around the lives of those who had learned to serve others...who had suffered, but who had been transformed and lifted by their suffering.  It takes more skill however to weave together the lives of characters that come from so many different directions.  Dickens is the master of this technique.  The reader had to do a good deal of work to keep all of the characters straight as they began to converge.  One was never quite sure if the author would return to the character when the storyline changed to another character.  There is a technique that one can use to subtly let the reader know, &#34;This person has a place in the future of this story.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|Great app. You can smash a crap load of zombies into your car. You can also shoot them. Great freakin game.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I did have trouble streaming to my computer. The first one streamed perfectly. While I was watching the 2nd episode, my computer shut down unexpectedly.  I have still not been able to stream to my laptop since then.  However, the Wii installation was easy, and watching that way works well.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I'm an extreme fan of Dexter and I was riveted with this season. Outstanding plot and of course the acting!
B00D5TASN2|5.0|David Lynch is my favorite filmmaker because I love his alternately inspiring, disturbing and intoxicating blend of dreamy, often nightmarish imagery with stylized sonic surrealism. His second album, &#34;The Big Dream,&#34; is more edgy and blues-based than his first, &#34;Crazy Clown Time,&#34; while being even more esoteric and elusive for the casual listener - not nearly as melodic or accessible as the symbiotic soundtracks of his common collaborator, Angelo Badalamenti. One's appreciation of Lynch's truly unique brand of music (or cinema) depends on whether you're tuned into his particular wavelength. If you're that lucky, nobody conveys the beauty and sadness of human existence on Earth like David Lynch, who paints indelible pictures in one's mind, creating a seductive mood that slowly draws you in, then quickly drowns you in blissfully quirky quicksand.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is something else it is awesome! I play it on my kindle and recommend this for all ages.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Okay, in today's society &#34;it's all been done before&#34; can be said about 99% of the movies the emerge out of a theater near you. A lot of those films leave people wishing that the blood, sweat & GBs the filmmaker's hard drives weren't so depressingly put to waste. With Oblivion, this is NOT the case!<br />This film was so well done, it's hard to notice any familiar events and scenarios that take place while they happened, and it take away from the experience.<br />It's so elegantly sequenced that I simply didn't care if it had happened in a movie before!<br />Yes, there are a lot of movies out there, a lot of failed attempts to entertain. This movie did not at all fail to entertain me.<br />I rarely ever purchase a film before seeing it, (2nd time in my entire life, the first was Appleseed Ex Machina) & I'm glad I did with this one!<br />This was the best form of familiar in a movie. Instant classic!!<br />It's a great addition to every sci-fi lover's arsenal.<br /><br />-Kskii
B009GX69RK|5.0|I absolutely love this series, I never want it to end. Good humor, and Zooey Deschanel is so spunky and cute.
0790734850|5.0|great film noir, great writing and greater acting.  The twists and turns in the storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B002R88G5E|3.0|I liked this book, even if it turned a little boring towards the end.<br />I liked the atmosfere, but I found the characters are somewhat flat.
B003ONNWO6|5.0|I'm now a bigger fan of David Foster. What a talented man! Every minute was terrific and left me wanting more of his music. You gotta get this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a really good game I love it. The graphics are good, and i never get bored while playing it.
B0030B621W|5.0|Sam Rockwell is a force. This is great suspenseful sci-fi without the big budget explosions. Kevin Spacey is also great as the computer.
B005544TRQ|5.0|There is very little on TV today that I want to watch every time it is on..........much less watch an episode more than once.  This is one of the really good ones!  The premise of the show is unusual.....very different.  The idea of a brain like \\"Mike's\\" being noticed and let flourish regardless of a lack of a degree is amazing and inspirational.  Then you have all the other personalities and intrigues to the plot.  You just can't beat it!! I was sorry \\"Mike's\\" grandmother died.  I loved her character and the relationship between grandmother and grandson.
B00DU73T08|4.0|I'll start by saying that I'm not a huge Stephanie Meyer fan. Yes, I watched all the Twilight movies once but they were cheesy to me and I'll probably never watch them again. When I first heard about this story, the early reviews had me worried, but when I saw the trailer I decided it had potential, and after watching it, I can honestly say I liked this film. I wasn't overly thrilled with the love story side, but at least this wasn't the cheesy high school love affair that Twilight was plagued with. So it gets 4 stars for being an overall good movie with a unique story that was entertaining and worth watching.
B004NS710C|5.0|This movie shows industries that just because a person gets older, they are not obsolete. To replace veteran workers<br />with younger, less experience people is not always the answer. In this movie the younger man(Chris Pine) had no idea<br />as to how to stop the runaway train. If Denzel Washington had not been around, a lot of people would had suffered when<br />that train reached its destination and crashed. It took a vet to get the job done.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|...I was quite surprised at how well and how quickly this movie grabbed me and held my interest to the very end. It was a great story that was both entertaining and thought provoking. The main character was believable to the very end and I found myself rooting for him in his desperate situation, all the while knowing that his older self was telling the story. Still, it was a rollercoaster ride that took me on an exciting adventure as I watched the story unfold. Well worth the time to watch.
0061191981|5.0|This book is more in-depth and differs slightly on several points about Gordon's life. It is good reading and really lets you get to know the true Gordon Ramsay. If you like him or even if you hate him, you'll leave this book and find out that you really didn't know him.
B003SAF76Q|3.0|I still listen to it, but there are a few songs that I skip over. Not my favorite, doubt I will buy anything else by them
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Love it. Simple enough but still cool. Only complaint. Days aren't in English all day. Worth the money. Would buy again.
B00138CXJO|2.0|Disapointed in this one. I love incubus, but this one only has a couple of really good songs. I don't like this one
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|The story line was simple to follow and flowed well.The special effects and detail in the giants looked very realistic. Overall a good movie
B0029OYPLK|5.0|Love It!  Winwood,Clapton, together!!! Awesome cd, Bluesy, Jazzy, this is the good stuff! Great cd for chillin with a nice wine and watchin the stars
B004SVM7BW|5.0|RepliGo PDF Reader is by FAR the BEST app in its category I have over five apps that can read PDF documents will probably delete a couple over the next month. It does everything you can possibly be asked of using and editing a PDF document..<br /><br />I use Dolphin as my browser and use Web to PDF to save anything of interest to my SD card. It can be edited with RGPR and becomes a handy reference tool in the future.
B005QVCXM6|4.0|Amy lee is amazing! I love her. Her voice is strong and clear and she is an amazing writer.This is the best album she has put out
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a bright 10 year old. He immediately started trying to solve it and could hardly put it down for the next week. It is very challenging.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|These guys just keep getting more awesome . The best drummer I have ever heard! 1 of my top 10 faves.  This album is a must have for you if you crave dam good &#34; in your face&#34;  &#34;make my ears bleed&#34; metal
B000007492|5.0|Supertramp doesn't just sing songs but they produced unforgettable ballads like my favorite \\"Take the Long Way Home.\\" For a long time, I wanted to hear it on a compact disc rather than the radio. This version is excellent as with other songs. Supertramp fused music and storytelling together. Their musical style is unique from other rock groups. Their other songs are equally excellent.<br /><br /> They are probably better known for their single, \\"Give A Little Bit,\\" which is played on in television commercials. What makes great music is his timeless to survive and endure decades later. This compact disc may not have all their greatest hits but they fifteen classics like \\"School;\\" \\"Goodbye Stranger;\\" \\"The Logical Song;\\" Bloody Well Right;\\" \\"Breakfast in America;\\" \\"Rudy;\\" \\"The Long Way Home;\\" \\"Crime of the Century;\\" \\"Dreamer;\\" \\"Ain't Nobody But Me;\\" \\"Hide in Your Shell;\\" \\"From Now On;\\" \\"Give a Little Bit;\\" \\"It's Raining Again;\\" and \\"Cannonball.\\"<br /><br />I remember when I first heard Supertramp's classic, \\"Take the Long Way Home.\\" The song was played in the television mini-series, \\"Blind Faith,\\" in 1989. It's a powerful song and here on this collection are others just as powerful.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|This is a cd to crank up loud ,roll the windows down and listen to over and over. Dam good jamming rockin out music
B0088T3B0G|5.0|Surprising and engaging. Very good acting. It's a sleeper, I didn't know about this one. Check it out. I enjoyed it.
B005869U6G|4.0|Much better than Light Grenades! Deep soulful lyrics.I like this one alot. Another good one for laid back chillin on the beach at sunset with your special person
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|great game it really showed my path in life. really inspiring. i think i am gonna go make some art.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Being a huge horror movie fan, I'm always on the search for something that will replace one of my &#34;top five or ten.&#34;  Martyrs came in and knocked out a few.  I'm not a big fan of the torture genre, but somehow Martyrs snuck in and really earned my respect.  It was definitely not &#34;torture-porn.&#34;  Based on what I'd read about the film, I was actually afraid to watch it.  I didn't want it to be one of those films you wish you could &#34;unsee.&#34;  In my humble opinion, it was handled with great care and I didn't feel that there was  ever &#34;too much.&#34;  Likes:  original, likable main characters (I actually cared about them), genuinely frightening, powerful, thought-provoking (had a long conversation w/ my friend afterward), GREAT effects, GREAT story, and in general, just a way better film than I thought it would be and I had pretty high expectations going in.  I could tell that the people involved really cared about it.  Can't wait to watch it again.  Dislikes: for as much as I enjoyed it, it was too short.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|the whole family sat and enjoyed it on our ROKU!!  Yes it streamed exceptionally well!!<br />strongly recommend for you and your family
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this movie. Glad I didn't waste my money at the movies on this one.<br />Was it comedy like I thought it would be. Depressing.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie knew how to keep you thinking and wondering what was going to happen and what was going on.
0399162097|5.0|I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this book. The plot is highly imaginative, the characters, unique and well defined and the setting beautifully articulated. I laughed and cried, always a sign of a true connection. This novel is funny, sad, clever and memorable. I'm going to get my hands on Karen Fowler's other novels as soon as possible.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|A fun graphic puzzle game. Try and avoid the clues, more enjoyable that way. The graphics are very good and I didn't run into any bugs.
1572816112|5.0|These are absolutely beautiful cards.  They are full of dark images but beautiful ones.  The set comes boxed with a poster layout guide.  It is lovely as well.  The cards are nice stock.  I have only looked at them so far.  I have not completed a reading and can not comment on that portion.  I haven't gotten to know the cards well enough yet.  Lovely just to have.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome I reccomend it to every one no trouble except for some lagging but still good so so yeah
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. I thought you had to buy the horse with real money, but I saw Beauty and fell in love. The only thing I don't like about this app is it takes a long time to load. Otherwise it's Awesomelisious ;)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I tthink it was awesome had lots of fun watching the movie and the game so addicting hope you have fun.:)
B008K8VDPU|3.0|It's a ok. But I don't like it a lot I think Magic piano better. This is about the second best game.
B0000DJYOX|5.0|Good price for a GREAT CD. It really lived up to ALL my expectations. Sounds almost as good as the VINYL.
1616550414|5.0|Book that shows everything about the series The Legend of Zelda.<br />Recommend to all fan of the series and games.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I love this movie for my daughter. She watches all the time. She can't wait until the second one is available
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Great story  Great acting  Great character development<br /><br />Very entertaining movie<br />Get yourself a bag of microwave popcorn and some white cheddar seasoning salt and kick back to watch a freakin awesome movie.<br /><br />ps.  you don't have to be a star trek fan to enjoy this movie.  I'm not really that much of a fan actually...this movie stands on its own.
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|I think they should make another category for this kind of movie. This movie was more gross than scary. One of the worse movies I have seen.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I really really, loved this movie a must see for those of you that like supernatural movies!!Go Hastings always ships on time or before. Only thing my disc gets stuck & stops I just have to wipe it sometimes,no big deal the price was right!! I hope someone else enjoys this movie!! TY
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Like any other book the beginning was slow but it picked up as we went further into the book. However towards the end of the book i felt like the author was trying to rush some things so I couldn't appreciate it as much I wanted to. I think other than that I really enjoyed the book and hope that other books don't rush the ending as much as this one did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love subway surfers . It's the only game I play ! I love the challenges but the only thing I would want to change is to increase the multiple by more than 30x because it was so easy to beat . And I would like more challenges to beat and receive bigger awards . However all in all its my favorite game . (:
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app like it's predecessor is simply amazing. It was well researched and had everything correct right down to the last detail, I really love this app
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this during the Netflix promotion so, bonus, it cost only $11.  For $11 (or $35) you can pretty much buy anything and hope it works.<br /><br />Bottom line?  IT IS AWESOME !<br /><br />It took me 3 minutes to set up.  3 minutes.  Seriously, really.<br /><br />And it works.  Perfectly.<br /><br />This is so good that my 9 year old son figured it out on the iPad (I set it up on my Android phone) in about 1 minute and was streaming netflix.<br /><br />Great great producr.
B0014JKJHK|5.0|I am a 60 year old veteran waitress who has not worked in a restaurant for 20 years.  In my first week, after two &#34;double&#34; shifts....there is not one pain in my feet.  This is incredible.  No cramping or numbness.<br /><br />Only negative is that my feet are sweating.  I cut out the solid air vents with an Exacto knife and the problem is solved.<br /><br />I can't recommend these enough.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|The character is wonderful.<br /><br />If anyone on earth could make a time-machine out of left over toaster parts, it would be MacGyver! I don't know who the writers were for the show, but they had spirit and an irreverent, fun sense of humor coupled with a lot of imagination! - One of them also had a couple of degrees in chemistry.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|I love the azada games on the computer but not on the kindle. Some of the don't seem to cooperate on the kindle but time still counts away.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and I just watched it again with my little brother. We were both laughing up a storm!
B00009L1UP|2.0|I like this band and remember the songs from the 80's. You must really want to hear another knid of music to want to like this band, but my ex was into this band and I reallu only love two songs on this CD.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|A thorough look at the life of Bob Marley and the man behind the music. The film also provided a glimpse of Jamaican history and culture. Very informative and equally enjoyable.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Love every song on this CD, again I love Nickelback. If you like this band, then this is one CD you must have in your car for work or just driving around.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|I've enjoyed all of this program - what a wicked bunch!  My only problem is that I find myself rooting for them, because I've always liked Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast is great, too.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I love this band and had to have their other CD Dark Horse. I cannot collect every CD, but with this band I really go after all their music CD's.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great story line and nice puzzles. At little too pricey but an excellent game, good follow through,! Graphics are clear and some are amazing.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|I love this movie. It's fun to see the old crew go to the USA, and I enjoy the attempt at &#34;fitting in&#34; with the people in California!
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I saw this movie in London`s odeon in marble arch. I absolutely loved it and can`t wait for it to be released on disc. It`s the best Superman to date in my opinion anyway. the dvd and Blu-ray can`t be released quick enough for me.
B007ZH9P0C|3.0|This is not the best song of the album but is a very commercial single, so I was expecting amazing remixes, both Avicci and Nissim remixes are great, but the rest of the tracks are not quite good, for a while I am feeling more and more dissapointed for the way that Madonna and her company are choosing the producers and mixes for her promotional singles. I just buy this because is Madonna.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|When all we hear of Afghanistan is its complicated politics Hosseini leaves them in the background. He does not idealize or excuse the culture of Afghanistan, but inform us (the readers) about it casually fluidly in the measure that the culture forms and informs the people caught in the middle. The majority of people in this world are caught in the vortex of forces we do not control, we just react an act according to our personal tendencies, Afghanis have one thing in their favor, that most of us do not, a writer like Hosseini that reminds the world that people, personal stories do matter.<br />Ready to read his next book.
B00E7SID9G|5.0|An Israeli settler trying to get a grip on a present reality. My reality that is kaleidoscopic.<br />This book answers so many questions that were scarcely asked.<br />The author takes you to a new realm of understanding.<br />Does he supplies solutions?<br />No he does not.<br />He does more than that.<br />So much more...<br />He hones and guides more questions.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Highly recommend that everyone read about this amazing inventor and man. It was very well written and interesting.  He is now one of my favorite historical figures.
1451695195|5.0|This was a must read from Dana Perino Recommeded this book.  It is absolutely amazing.  It really is a must read
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Interesting secrets of the past revealed in this book. Many of us have often fantisized about our parents past. This books feeds that desire.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is so funny and off the wall.  I couldn't stop laughing.  Some of my favorite TV actors just having fun!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My all time dysfunctional family movie. Funny, even zany, but sweet and emotional (for a second). What do YOU think Margo?
B00DURILJ2|3.0|This movie is about 20 minutes too long.  Do people still live on rivers in Arkansas? And what happened to all the black residents? Not worth your time or money.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|This is basically Rocky.  But without the stellar cast and performances...lol.<br /><br />The storyline is basically the same, small underdog fighter (atom) gets a shot at the big time fight with a little help from his friends.<br /><br />This is a good movie to just sit back, relax, and munch on the popcorn to.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Keeps getting better and better...writing is fresh and funny.  LOVE this show.  Seller was very prompt...I was just late with review..Great job
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have seen all these movies numerous times so the point of buying them wasn't to watch.  I bought this collection for all the extras.  There are hours of set shots and interviews.  Well worth the purchase.
B002RKS81O|5.0|This book is one of the books that should be given to teenage girls at about 15. It shows them the TRUTH about love and romance...and I do mean the truth. That sometimes you meet your Prince Charming but most of the time you have to adjust your vision of who in reality your Prince Charming is going to be.
0451450523|5.0|Amazing, well written little story. Thank you for the wonderful recommendation Patrick. Can't wait for Broners in the Mist ;)
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Bought this book immediately after finishing the second in the series and the convenience factor of having here in minutes never ceases to amaze me. No library, no bookstore (my small town doesn't have one anyway)...awesome job amazon as always  And I would HIGHLY recommend this trilogy. The first book is hard to get into, but hang in there. I loved the second and the third in my opinion is his best.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|On a scale of, let's say, one to five stars, this book deserves a hell of a lot more stars than that. Quit reading this review and get this book already! Can't wait for book three, Broners in the Mist, as revealed on the NSFW Show
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|The testimony to this processor, is the fact that when I'm writing review for this after two years of my purchase, i have absolutely nothing to complain about! I've never felt left behind in any games that I've played so far<br /><br />PS: I use 460 GTX SLI + h80i for cooling, works out pretty well :o) along with my 16 GB Corsair Dominators
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|This was not a good movie!  If it WAS a good movie, then it was about an hour too long.  The entire purpose of filming this piece of work seemed to be displaying spattering blood. ... and poorly done at that.  I have asked my husband to remind me to never again watch anything directed by Tarentino.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great sequel to the first book! I thoroughly enjoyed how much drama and action was incorporated in between the explicit passions of Christian and Ana. This was definitely a page turner! I can't wait to read the third installment!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3, like previous seasons, will not disappoint. Loved it! Can't wait for season 4. :) Story lines are riveting making it impossible to wait for the next episode.
B000H1RFKA|4.0|Think of this as Shane black's demo reel for doc savage. Great movie and great cast! It also features a great script.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It's not perfect, and every critic will find something to point out, especially in a series with this much material, but what is?  My personal disappointment was actually &#34;the&#34; battle, Rand and the Dark One.  In general I agree with many of the other thorough and positive reviews here and would second most of their thoughts.  Parts of it did feel a little rushed, and an aspect or two may feel strange or out of place to you, but overall this is an excellent conclusion to an epic tale, for the most part wrapping up the major threads.  Probably the worst part is the loss you'll feel, almost like the passing of a dear pet...<br /><br />If you've made it this far, you can't stop now... If you haven't started the series for fear it may disappoint in the end, jump in, and know that you're in for a great relationship, er, series.
