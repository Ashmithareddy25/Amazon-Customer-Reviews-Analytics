B004VFYPTW|5.0|It's only a \\"nineties\\" album by sheer technicality...[[ASIN:B002APNQEU Slip of the Tongue (W/Dvd  Aniv)]] was released on November 18, 1989, and this Donnington set is from August 18, 1990 (headlining a bill that included Aerosmith, Poison, Quireboys, and Thunder). I see it as more of a \\"last gasp of classic 1980s hair metal.\\" After \\"Slip,\\" there wouldn't be another Whitesnake album until [[ASIN:B000006TNQ Restless Heart]], and that was actually a Coverdale solo album released under the Whitesnake logo due to the insistence of his record label.  In addition to his tenure with Frank Zappa and his solo works, Steve Vai had become well known for a bit of band hopping: Alcatrazz, [[ASIN:B000QXDE6I Disturbing the Peace]] (1985), Public Image Limited, [[ASIN:B000005IRS Compact Disc]] (1985), and two albums with the post-Van Halen David Lee Roth.   As work began on the follow-up to their ridiculously popular album [[ASIN:B000000OPZ Whitesnake]], guitarist Vivian Campbell left the band, and second guitarist Adrian \\"The Flying Dutchman\\" Vandenberg suffered a wrist injury that took him out of the game. Vai stepped in and played all of the guitars on \\"Slip,\\" and by the time of the Donnington show, Vandenberg was back.  In terms of \\"serious music\\" and \\"perfect audiophile sound quality\\" and virtually any egghead qualifier you might want to slap on this CD/DVD (yes, buy the package that includes BOTH), you can't bring those things into a discussion about Whitesnake. It's always been about excess, about crude \\"boys in the band\\" behavior (Coverdale often ping-pongs between gentleman and pig in his stage banter).  And Vai? This is the guy who successfully transcribed Frank Zappa's \\"The Black Page,\\" a piece of music so complex that most musicians would balk at attempting to play it. He's got the precision, he's got the Van Halen / Satriani \\"million notes a second\\" thing down cold, and at the same time, he's one of the true kings of wretched excess. Could there be a better onstage foil for Coverdale?  And for the record, Vandenberg wasn't all that impressed with Vai's contribution to \\"Slip.\\"  The Donnington set serves up the key tracks from \\"Whitesnake\\" that you saw / heard a zillion times on MTV (\\"Is This Love,\\" \\"Here I Go Again,\\" the set-closing \\"Still Of The Night,\\" plus \\"Bad Boys\\"), as well as 5 of the original 10 tracks from \\"Slip\\" (\\"Slip Of The Tongue,\\" \\"Judgement Day,\\" \\"Kitten's Got Claws,\\" \\"Cheap & Nasty,\\" \\"Fool For Your Loving\\"). There are solo segments from Vandenberg and Vai, plus the expected Whitesnake classics like \\"Slide It In.\\"  It's big hair! It's loads and loads of \\"guitar face!\\" It's romantic \\"power ballads\\" balanced with infantile, sexist headbanging!  In short, it's an essential 80s/90s time capsule treasure.  Not everyone's cup of tea (just like frontman David Coverdale himself), but if you were there...ESPECIALLY if you were there, be it at Donnington or in front of your TV while those Tawny Kitaen videos seemingly played ON THE HOUR, 7 days a week, on MTV...you can't possibly be without this one.
B004W4N55C|5.0|People, including myself,  grumble about Amazons intrusive permissions; I usually prefer the Market for apps anyway. Usually the free app promotion is a bust for me, but I still check everyday usually. Why? For an unreal deal like this great app for free! Amazon can have my SSN &amp; firstborn if they'll keep giving away apps of this quality! LOL...If you're a guitarist, at any skill level, this is golden; great free app, great $8 app. Thanks for the great gift Amazon...
B000002J09|5.0|The package arrived on time without any damages. The CD itself had the studio quality I was looking for. And the CD sleeve had the lyrics of Stairway to Heaven in a really cool text.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Just a brilliant app. Tight integration of chord tool, tuner, tab scroller and even plays songs for example. No issues on a HTC Aria.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|Even though the description says a digital copy is included, it is NOT.  The digital copy offer expired on 9/13/11 and WB will no longer honor the digital copy codes.  Huge disappointment.
B004W4N55C|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for.  So far so good. I would probably pay a couple bucks for this one.  I just need to get a tablet so I can have a bigger screen.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I had held off on this one for a long time, but after a recommendation from a friend I gave in and snagged it. A lot of fun and the touch interface is utilized to it's fullest. Fun graphics and casual challenges.

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Captain America, is one of the oldest comic book heroes, up there with Superman and Batman. For some reason, he never had the spotlight like those other two. In fact he was a hero that was practically crapped on with plenty of horrible representations in other various media. With the Avengers story line doing so well in the box office, Marvel finally reached the story line of this superhero, and I am glad to say that Captain America has finally witnessed justice.<br /><br />`Captain America: The First Avenger' is, in fact a prequel to all the other films we have seen until now. It is the story that takes place during World War Two, and the creation of a soldier that was able to take the enemy down. The job was not given to the strongest, or the brashest of men. In fact it was given to a man who was as imperfect as you can get, but his eagerness to put others in front of himself and his want to right wrongs, gave this man the chance to be something great. With that, Captain America was born.<br /><br />This film was so enjoyable, the cast was very well put together. While I was curious about Chris Evans playing this specific hero, I was impressed. The rest of the cast including Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were well placed and fun to watch. What I was happy about the most was the tribute that this film played to Captain America's history in comics, with a lot of references that are scattered throughout the film. To me, this may have been the most accurate depiction of a super hero, even giving Christopher Nolan's Batman a run for its money on accuracy.<br /><br />This is a movie you will like, even if you have never seen any of the other Marvel Studio films, it is a simple, yet complex story and loads of fun.
0446547654|2.0|I have read Nicholas Sparks last two novels, and I have to say, the stories personally left me unfulfilled. The two main characters of The Best of Me, Dawson and Amanda, the contrived circumstances that separated them, the lives they have lead as well as the reason for their reunion, are all implausible. I tried in vain to maintain the suspension of disbelief. I was rooting for the protagonists to grow beyond the past that developed their present circumstances and lead to creating a thriving future where they were fulfilled either together or apart. Once I realized the direction the story was headed, I read on, still hopeful my instincts would be proven wrong. Forgiveness comes in many forms, and I just felt Dawson's character deserved a more respectful story and a more satisfying way of redemption. Mr. Sparks has a way of writing stories where characters fight against and hide their basic needs and true feelings, finally revealing those hidden and buried emotions and feelings they've spend years denying, and then letting contrived plot points unravel the very story the reader is hoping to invest into. It's only my opinion, but the dissatisfaction I had with this story and with Safe Haven have turned me off to reading any future Nicholas Sparks novels. Respectfully, Mr. Sparks writing is beautiful. I just have different visions and preferences of the kinds of stories and characters that interest me. I remember reading The Notebook, riveted to how wonderfully the story unfolded, revealing the love that was heartfelt and real and an ending that touched my heart and soul. There's a spark, no pun intended, that is missing in Mr. Sparks recent stories.
0765356139|5.0|I have just finished the best series of all time, Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson, and though I am glad to have seen the end I find myself saddened at the same time. This series was one such that I wish could have gone on and on. I know I will greatly miss the interactions of the many characters in this series as well as the comradeship of it all. I will miss how the series managed to explain such complex issues as \\"why does God let bad things happen?\\" I can say now in good conscience and knowing full well I speak the truth, that Brandon Sanderson is the best writer I have seen. In fact, I'd say he is the best writer of our time, if not of ALL time. I recommend all who those who have any love of reading to read the Mistborn series.

B003QO8TDC|5.0|Saw this at the theater many years ago, and really enjoy watching it at home now. Always a classic for our age.
B0015DROBO|4.0|One of my friends loaned me this book, and I kept picking it up, reading a few pages, then putting it down.  It took me close to 200 pages before I was able to get into the story.  However once I did, I throughly enjoyed it and immediately bought the second book.<br /><br />I think part of the problem with the slow start was my own as I waited too long between readings and would have to kind of backtrack.  But the other part was definitely Larsson's...he just took too long developing the beginning with slow character development and plot.<br /><br />At the end of the day I did enjoy the book and would recommend it to those who like a good mystery.
B00125JP1C|5.0|This movie was fantastic, I've must have seen it at least 6 times. It has just the perfect amount of awesome kicka$$ action perfectly paired with the writer's hilarious and twisted sense of sarcasm and humour. It even has subtle jokes you don't get until you see it another time. It's brilliantly put together and doesn't take itself too seriously at all, but still has enough action to fulfill your NEEDS!
B004W4N55C|4.0|Finally somthijg I can truely use. I needed something for my Xoom to take with me and here it is. All works well. Needs yet to be optimized for the tablet but still a great app. The are just a few glitches in some of the buttons/menu but I can not live with.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|All three female principals in this opera are fantastic. Netrebko, Garanca and Kulman own the screen. They deliver a performance that will have you glued to your seat. I agree with some of the reviews I've read on Amazon regarding Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and Francesco Meli not being as strong as the part may demand, and I must say I preferred Ildar Abdrazakov as Henry VIII in the Metropolitan Opera's production this year. Ironically, he sang against Netrebko at the Met and was wonderful. It's really a small quibble. D'Arcangelo and Meli deliver world-class performances and they are wonderful voices against Netrebko and Garanca.<br /><br />In addition, the Vienna Opera Orchestra will leave you breathless with this performance. The music took on a dimension I haven't heard with other productions of Anna Bolena, so it was like hearing it anew. Evelino Pid&ograve; conducted this performance, and I was enthralled at his interpretation. Make sure to play it LOUD!<br /><br />For my money, if you're an opera lover, this is a not-to-be-missed performance. At $29, you're crazy not to buy it!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have been using this app for well over a year now and have had very few issues with it. And when their are issues they are normally fixed quickly with a update.

B004W4N55C|5.0|this is one of my top 5 favorite apps.  if you play the guitar and want a useful tool on your phone, this is a great program to use.  in addition to the song tabs, it also has a built in tuner, metronome, and chord charts.

B005HXGE9G|5.0|Just an amazing compilation. A magical interpretation of what was already wonderful. Peter Gabrial has never stopped re-creating himself.Turn on and tune out.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Few people have added as much to our knowledge of ourselves as Daniel Kahneman. In this book he synthesizes not only his discoveries but those of many others into a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts, illuminating a very wide range of human behavior. It is a dense, full book that I know I will return to repeatedly, and yet is also very clearly and engagingly presented.  It should probably be said that Kahneman, his Nobel in economics not to the contrary, is in fundamental conflict with a very large segment of the economics profession. Most of the \\"Chicago School\\" sees neoclassical economics as a normative theory, not simply a descriptive one. That is, they are committed to the view that people _should_ make rational choices in the sense defined by the theory, and that failure to do so is evidence of defect. I have known and worked with a number of economists and observed that they often regard the inistance of Kahneman and like-minded psychologists that the human mind is not adapted to economic rationality as being distinctly reprehensible. There will no doubt be hostile comments in reviews and they need to be evaluated in this light.
B001U5V03U|3.0|I agree with the other review. \\"Vocally, Simon Keenlyside's reprisal of Don G is a failure for himself.   The Champagne Aria simply fails to take off, and the duet with Zerlina too 'creamy', while the Serenade is sorely 'under'. \\" I hate to say that the Serenade is terrible.  The orchestra is just so so. The stage is just OK.  Ramon Vargas meets expectation and excels others.  The best performance is the role of Leporello.  Joyce Didonato was doing her best.  Marina poplavskaya's black dress is beautiful.  The final nude scene was shocked. I guess Don Giovanni was punished that way.  I recommend Muti, Edita Gruberova, Ann Murray and Susanne Mentzer Scala version. Karajan, Samuel Ramey, Anna Tomowa-Sintow and Kathleen Battle Wiener Philharmoniker version is also a good choice.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|So apparently I'm one of the few people on the planet who thinks the new Lou Reed album with Metallica is fantastic. Oh well.<br /><br />For those wondering if they should buy it, it is really a Lou Reed album. So if you are a Lou Reed fan, then it's his best album since New York: Buy it. If you're a Metallica fan only...well then buy the new Megadeth disc instead. You probably won't like this much at all. If you like Lou and Metallica, well then you probably have it already and are enjoying the Hell out of it.<br /><br />Two things I am critical of:<br /><br />Lars sometimes attempts to play things he's not quite capable of pulling off. Everyone knows he's not the most skilled drummer, except for him. He needs to learn his limits.<br /><br />James should not have added any vocals. It sounds ridiculous whenever he tries to sing. Lou should have been the only voice on the disc.  The infamous \\"I am the TABLE!!\\" sequence in The View is just utterly silly. Him yelling \\"Small Town Gir!l\\" over and over in Brandenburg Gate mars an otherwise great song. I'm glad that his vocals are at a minimum and are only on a few songs.<br /><br />This is minor though. Other than that, it is an unbelievably great disc from Lou Reed with Metallica acting as a great backing band.

Now I can hear myself over the rest of the band when they have their amps cranked and the sound is bouncing all over the room. Very helpful, and pretty inconspicuous as well. Runs a long time on one charge and I've never had it go dead in a performance.

1451648537|5.0|Those of you expecting a biography utterly favorable to Jobs as a visionary and on a personal level will be disappointed. What Isaacson does so well, at points almost overdoing it, is painting a picture of a man, like most great men, with many contradictions. Jobs was a Zen buddhist, shunning materialism and crafting even his diet to reflect a simple purity akin to his spiritual beliefs. However, he was also the symbol of American capitalism, building a company image almost to a fetish and driving profits to record levels, at one point even leading a near bankrupt company from the brink to become the most profitable company in the world. This is a biography well done because it doesn't settle for the easy answers - a man born an orphan who takes over the world in an attempt to prove his worth to parents that have forsaken him. No, Jobs did not miss his biological parents because his adoptive parents fed and nourished his intellect and needs. Jobs was driven to spirituality, drive to success, treading over anyone in his way, friend or foe and at times vindicated and at times thrown out of his own company by his own selfish actions and desires.<br /><br />If anything, what history and life teaches us is that great men are men of insufferable contradictions - Tolstoy, Jefferson - men of wealth writing to liberate the serfs; a slave owner penning the words of equality in the Constitution. Greatness then is not a consequence of vision and moral beliefs, it is a by product, perhaps accidental; a result of insufferable soul searching and privilege and out-of-body experiences.<br /><br />The great American poet Walt Whitman wrote in The Leaves of Grass, \\"This is no book; who touches this, touches a man.\\" Isaacson succeeds in presenting Jobs as an unfiltered creative, at times cruel and contradictory soul. A truly great read for it's vision to present more than the man, but to offer an insight into the man.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Years ago I had a book that featured all the different chord positions for a particular chord along the fretboard.  I lost that book and have never been able to find another one like it.  This fantastic app not only offers this feature, but also gives you the sample sound each chord configuration makes.  Well worth the money, but even better as the FAOTD!  Thank you, Amazon!
B002BSHWUU|4.0|First off I've been a Beatles fan since 8:00 Sunday Feb. 9, 1964.   For a Beatles fan this is a must. I also have the Mono Box. I would  have to rate it a perfect 5 star. The CD's being in the mini album  format just as the original albums with all inserts is very nice.  That is the only thing negative about this box. The sound is great.  The box is nice displays very well. The extra stuff with each CD is  great but would of like to keep the CD's in the mini album format.  If you know a Beatles fan this would make a great Christmas gift.
B00000DATR|3.0|Yes I know I will probably take a few slings and arrows for saying that I liked this better than TB II, and my reasoning is this. Tubular Bells II was really nothing more than a pale re-tread of the original Tubular Bells album, there I said it. From the man who gave us the original Bells album and then went pop on us in the 80's and it was still good music (as opposed to top 40 pop), I just expected more. I am happy to say, TB III is really what TB II should have been. Yes some of the original ideas of the original Bells are here, but he goes a lot further and builds upon them, making something new while still drawing on the original.  The only drawback is the song \\"Man In the Rain\\" which is really just a copy of \\"Moonlight Shadow\\", probably tossed onto the album so it would have a single which would make the label happy.  Simply put if you enjoyed the original Tubular Bells album, and you want at updated, almost modern music twist on it, I think you'll like this.

Steinbeck's novel, which depicts the plight of migrants during the Dust Bowl era, elucidates topics as current as this morning's newspaper-- bank foreclosures, hunger, poverty, immigration, collective voice.

0446604844|4.0|i read most of this book when it first came out some 14 years ago or so , somewhat enjoying it  i've read numerous reviews and felt i had to re read it again  ok i agree it is somewhat convoluted , long ,   but i feel after just finishing it for the second time that it is what it is , escapist fiction  among the other David Baldacci titles this is among his best  numerous characters were fleshed out better than his recent books  ok so there were many detours in the book , too many extra characters than necessary  but after awhile you felt bad for the two main characters  i've read or skimmed many books over my 50 plus years , but the plot , though convoluted was enjoyable  a cat and mouse game of catch me if you can..  i'm one of this book's many fans ...book was a bit too long for a movie tie in , though i wouldn't mind  a 4 part tv or cable movie tie in ..  i was emotional at the end , so , call me a bit sentimental , but at 50 plus years of age , i have an excuse  i had hoped for a second act for the male female leads , but to no avail...  would've liked to find out how Sidney Archer led her life after and if the senior FBI agent ever reconciled with his  estranged family and ex wife  one problem with the book  : too many killings , all the border line bad guys killed  one item i agreed with regarding the 1 and two star reviews , the book was implausible , too long ..  after reading several other Baldacci books , i felt the two main characters were well thought out and defined  to all 1 and two star reviewers , try re reading it for just excapist fiction , the editing deserves at least 3 stars  but the action was fourth rate  a part of me felt there should have been a follow up where Sidney and Lee fall in love at a later time  hell with the age difference..  would tie up loose ends  a book is only as good as the editing goes ..wothy of a four...
B001UV4XI8|3.0|I purchased this in October 2011 expecting the Blu-Ray, DVD, & Digital Copy (as advertised), but when the movie arrived, I found that the digital copy expired on 9/13/2011!  Sure enough, there is nothing on the site indicating that the digital copy has expired, so I call shenanigans.  Amazon needs to update the site and give everyone who bought it under false pretenses their digital copy.
B004UQPM4E|2.0|Ordered this title a couple of months back after Amazon supposedly cleared up the issue of selling the wrong version.  They didn't.  I was sent the Spanish Import version.  Very disappointed.  The actual films are in English, I believe.  But the packaging is different and the discs don't display the title of each film on them prominently. (Though, I do believe they are in small letting along the edges of each disc.) Yes, it's not the end of the world, but I would like to receive the exact product I paid for.  I didn't keep it long enough to discover if there were any other differences.  I did return it and was issued a refund, hence the extra star.  But since enough people have had issue with this, Amazon really needs to stop selling this version.  I eventually just went out and paid full price at Best Buy.  It's a great boxed set.  Love the movies, even the bad ones.  Lots of extras.  Just wish Amazon would clear up this problem so other buyers don't have to go through the same hassle I did.
B001HN6922|4.0|When Lightining McQueen and Mater head to Japan and Europe to compete in the World Gran Prix, Mater becomes involved in international espionage by mistake.<br /><br />Cars 2 is the second film, besides Toy Story, to become a sequel. Unfortunately, the movie has recieved mixed reviews all over. Everyone claims this is Pixar's first misfire with their animated films. I'm not as convinced as others that this movie is so bad. It doesn't have the emotional impact that the first movie has but it is a fun movie. Whatever possessed them to make a spy movie out of the Cars universe is beyond me but, for what it is, it actually worked and turned out to be a pretty good movie to me. It's not great but it isn't godawful either(if I had to pick another Pixar movie that I felt was godawful, it'd have to be Finding Nemo-even though that one did well at the box-office). On a technical level, Cars 2 is the best looking Pixar movie to date.<br /><br />Given Pixar's track record with movies(even if people do consider this to be bad), they deserve one misfire- they're only human. We all make mistakes. The important thing is we learn from our mistakes. In my opinion, Cars 2 is a winner so don't let these bad reviews persuade you otherwise.
B001TAFCBC|1.0|how is this movie so well reviewed? It sucked hard. Watched maybe 15 mins of it several years ago. With all the good reviews I almost want to finish it, but it sucked that bad that I can't.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|My kids want to do a marathon session of all 8 movies with their friends.  I was able to find an 11 disc Blu-Ray set of movies 1-8 at Amazon UK.  It had a list price of 32 pounds but you don't have to pay the VAT so it came out to only 30 pounds including shipping or just $48.  I'm not sure what will be on the extra three discs compared to the US version, perhaps some of the extra features some people are so upset about...  My kids don't care about the extra features so I was only looking for the cheapest versions of the standard theatrical releases in BD, but for $34 less I'll take the special features and wait til 2nd week of December to receive it.   They also have a limited edition version which has 19 discs and a book and a \\"numbered\\" box, I assume this has all the features everyone wants...  It's about twice the price.  Both versions are Region Free so they will work on any player unlike the DVD versions which only work on European formatted TV's and players.

0715338153|5.0|These four little books have dozens of ideas and patterns for dolls and toys designed by one of my favorite artists.  Lots of full color photos, good instructions, and easy patterns.  A very good deal for the quality.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|If you like Lou Reed's Velvet Underground, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" period...Plus, Metallica's metal bonfides, you're going to love this album.  Those not familiar with Lou Reed and only Metallica fans who hate change and are metal fundamentalists, you're going to hate this album.  To those people I say...get a grip would ya?  This record shows that Metallica likes growing and taking chances.  Rolling Stone reports Lou Reed is receiving death threats from fundamentalist Metallica fans.  Sheeshhh...

159562015X|1.0|This is not a review of the book itself, but rather a warning that buying the book used is like throwing your money away.  You have to buy a book to get the access code to take the test, and once the code's been used it cannot be used again.  So unless you somehow get a used book with an unused code, the book is worthless.  Once I have my new book with a usable code, I will review the book on its merits alone.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This is an enjoyable movie to watch.  Great special effects, good acting, and a decent plot make it worthy.  Could it have been done better?  Only in the plot.  I wont go into details since the plot has been told by many previous reviews, but the ending could of been done better.  I understand Marvel wanted to bridge the gap into the 21st century and have Captain America be a part of The Avengers, but the ending was not as good as expected.  That though is being picky on my part.  I enjoy Superhero movies and Marvel and DC have done an overall good job on bringing their characters to the big screen.  This movie is no exception.  It is great fun to watch and I recommend it to any Superhero fan!
B000ICXQXI|4.0|I found the film Psycho a very interesting film. It caught my attention as Hitchcock made sure he put every insight into this film. He captured his thoughts in great detail and made sure he could make it to his perfection. The shower scene which he shot only lasted about 42 seconds but he took 7 and a half days to shoot this. He wanted it to shock the viewers, especially as he was killing off what the viewers would have thought was the main character so early in to the film. Hitchcock used his talent in so may ways and even made the viewers think they were involved in the film. Good job to the director!
B005KGPC4S|2.0|[[ASIN:B003V5CFV8 O Brother, Where Art Thou?]] meets [[ASIN:0307387135 No Country for Old Men]], and it's not the good parts of either of those movies that are captured here. The plot takes a turn at Snookity Loopdy Doo about half way through. The cinematography is all over the place in terms of quality. The action sequences are bland and have that whole issue where you never get a good shot of what's going on (like a poor attempt to imitate the firefights from [[ASIN:B002T4HWLK Public Enemies]]). The majority of the characters' actions make little to no sense at all. Even the themes of the movie (it tries to touch on many) get lost in all of the ridiculous BS that Kevin Smith tries to pass off as an artsy take on the horror/action/suspense/political narrative genre.  The only positives I can identify are that the acting is pretty darn good (especially considering how pants-on-head retarded the material is) and, at least up until the halfway point, the movie keeps you wanting more.  There's a fine line between a movie trying to be different and a movie not having any real purpose or meaning, and Red State crosses over onto the side of the latter and just gets worse and worse with every scene. It is just unnecessarily weird and incoherent and not worth your time.
0547258305|4.0|It took me a couple of days, and of course, my husband had that look in his face, you know the one that says: \\"Oh crap...she is gone again\\".<br /><br />I really liked it, although I won't give it 5 stars. I loved that it had a beautiful moral lesson, and I thought it was very different and clever that the author didn't go for the same old romance story in which the heroine lost herself in love with the hero, she actually loves him without changing any of what she stands for (I could give a lot of examples in which this happens, but I will stick to review only this novel).<br /><br />It's a story about self discovery, compassion, love and adventure. You will definitely get caught in it. It's written very fluidly, and even though it suppose to take place in a different era, the language is pretty easy without losing its \\"medieval touch\\".<br /><br />I have always preferred books written in first person, but this one made me forget that it wasn't by page 30...good sign.<br /><br />So what do we have?: strong female lead that doesn't lose her sense of self for a man, adventure, surprising turn of events, romance, self discovery, moral lesson and fluid writing. The only downsides were: the ending (kind of make me feel that something was missing), and a little more thrill (I didn't feel the urge to get the characters together as much as always).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Just be sure you have a weekend to spare, because it will be kind of hard to put down.

B004HW7JMO|4.0|I loved this show when it was on TV, and the discs and everything else are in the shape I was promised. No issues here.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|One word, WOW! This is great! I got this for my 15th birthday (this is my dad's amazon account) and i was speechless when I opened up the box. I'm not ashamed at all that I love legos. The box weighs at least 20 pounds and is split into 4 sub-boxes. The instruction manual is about the size of your average drawing pad and weighs about 5 pounds. There are about 23 mini-figures. The finished structure is very durable, although it doesn't seem it from the picture on the box, it is about 16 inches long and 16 inches high, and it's very light because the floors are mostly hollow. All in all, a very good product and great for star wars fans and lego fans!
0812971825|5.0|I really loved ABIDE WITH ME by Elizabeth Strout.  I love the title, too, because \\"Abide With Me\\" is one of my favorite hymns, and it ran through my head all the way through this book.  In 1959, in West Annett, Maine, a pastor named Reverend Tyler Caskey meets us head on with his life and the life of his congregation resting on faith in God, prayer, love for God, kindness for each other and Dietrich Bonhoeffer.  Tyler Caskey sees God everywhere.  He sees Him in trees, flowers, his family's faces.   When the Caskeys first move to West Annett, a member of the church invites them for a potluck supper and all in the congregation are asked to attend.  This is the first time they meet Mrs. Caskey, and the people are a bit put off by Lauren Caskey, the minister's wife, because she comes from a rich family and wears fashionable clothes, paints her nails, wears heels and also isn't all that interested in discussing just housekeeping and children.  The community decides they don't like Lauren Caskey.  Too hoity toity.  The Caskeys have two little girls, Jeannie, the baby, and Margaret, the 5-year-old.  Before very long, there is a tragedy that strikes, leaving little Margaret unable to speak, except in short sentences which frustrates everyone at school. Not a lot of people like little Margaret.  Tyler tries to hold everyone together, but with little money and living in an old rundown farmhouse, it is a struggle.  Margaret's teacher and a school psychologist try to find out what's wrong with her, but it only angers her father who is trying to do the right thing for his daughter.  His housekeeper is a source of comfort to all of them, but she has a secret which eventually catches up to her and she must leave the Caskey household.  Tyler is slowly losing his grip, losing his faith and losing his way until the day comes when he must look inside himself for his own strength and the ability to carry on while still believing that he can rely on God as well, and pull everyone's secrets out in the air so that they are not mired down with guilt and fear.  Everyone's secrets, that is, except his own.  He has to learn to rise above the criticism and rumors that people have started for the lack of anything else worthwhile to talk about in such a small place as West Annett.  ABIDE WITH ME is a very touching book and is beautifully written.  I enjoyed it so much and I recommend it to readers of literary fiction.  I found that I had to take my time in reading this book.  It isn't one to fly through like a short mystery, but takes time and thought.
B0000062FL|5.0|Abrasax is associated with a singular composite figure, having a Chimera-like appearance somewhat resembling a basilisk or the Greek primordial god Chronos (not to be confused with the Greek titan Cronus). According to E. A. Wallis Budge: as a All-God, he appears on the amulets with the head of a cock (Phaebus) or of a lion (Ra or Mithras), the body of a man, and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions, types of the Agathodaimon. In his right hand he grasps a club, or a flail, and in his left is a round or oval shield.<br /><br />Commonly engraved onto a ring to ward off evil.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|Let me start out by saying this is a good case. It protects well, and I haven't had any scratches or other physical damage. There are a few small flaws though. I have the AT&T SGS2, and the screen protector is not quite the right size and has the physical button cut-out on the bottom. This isn't really an issue save for aesthetics, but some people might not like that. I suppose it would also be possible, albeit unlikely to scratch in that small unprotected area. The rubber part is incredibly easy to put on and fits like a glove, but I did have trouble getting the plastic part around that, which I think could have been designed better, since it's kind of a pain to take off and replace. All-in-all, good case, I'm happy with it.
B0011Z3334|2.0|I had the displeaure of seeing this \\"band\\" opening for No Doubt. When I heard them then I thought every song sounded the same, buried beneath the unfortunate mixing job their live sound engineer was barely accomplishing. I thought they may have some potential and I was right as evidenced by exactly two tracks on this album, crushcrushcrush and some other song I can't be bothered to learn the name of. Overall the studio album is depressingly similar to their live show, track after track of soul numbing sameness.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Truly an awesome, ultimate program for any level of skill. You get 5* and a thank you! Pls add the 11 and 13 chords, and their #'s and b's.  This really is a great learning/teaching tool. Thanks again for sharing it for Free, I for one will recommend it, well worth every penny!

1599218011|5.0|Having recently completed my last of 12 chemo treatments for Hodgkins Lymphoma, I have been researching to determine what the rest of my life is going to look like.  How can I take responsibility for myself and know that I'm doing everything I can (as CEO of Me, Inc.) to prevent the possibility of ending up right back in the infusion center?  Well, after watching quite a few documentaries and researching online, I bumped into Kris Carr.  Kind of hard not to, actually.  And I was very pleased to make her (limited) acquaintance.  After joining her website, watching her on youtube and downloading her books, I'm pleased to say she's my lifestyle guru.  Love her, hate her, expert or not ... what she says is good.  And man does she say a lot of it!  This book has almost every integrative suggestion I've come across in my research all nicely packed into one place.  There's no filler, there's no useless fluff.  Just section after section of practical tips on what works, why and where/how you can buy it or incorporate it into your life.  Whether you've had Crazy Sexy Cancer or too many Crazy Sexy Cheeseburgers, this book will give you invaluable tips on living a life of balance and health!  I have not stopped recommending it since I read it ... bet you won't either!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Wow. This book is awesome fun. The heat between Travis and Pidge? Best I've ever read.<br /><br />What Jamie McGuire does so perfectly in this book is that she gave me what I wanted to happen, not what she *should* have done. And not what a publisher would have made her do. Equally important is what she *didn't* do, i.e.;no pregnancy scares (I think we're all sick of reading about those). This is not a book about morals and ethics, but it's not supposed to be. It's about watching the characters and their relationships and understanding their behavior as Jamie trickles in information about their pasts. Enjoy the ride because it's a fantastic one.<br /><br />The relationship between the leads is steamy, obsessive, volatile, and incredibly deep and believable. But again, Jamie did not go too far with this. No one is physically or mentally abused, but rather the relationship's inherent intensity and the characters' personalities give the perfect backdrop for the many ups and downs. And the college-age piece works perfectly. God, I remember how emotional relationships could be then, how it was so easy to go from one extreme to the other in a flash... That is captured so well in this book. And Travis? Look, I have never wanted to f...er, engage in naughty activities... with a fictional character as much as I do him. He and Pidge are flawed, but beautifully flawed, and that is what makes them so real. Bravo, Jamie!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|For years, I have viewed Steve Jobs as a near saint, the one person who knew what we wanted, better than we ourselves knew what we wanted.  Just about every company is now trying to copy the iPhone and iPad and even the MacBook Air.   Nobody is perfect.  We all have weaknesses.  We have all made mistakes, and sometimes, we have made big mistakes.  Unfortunately, Steve Jobs was one of the worlds WORST human beings, when it came to his employees, his colleagues, and even to his family.  His temper tantrums and his insults and tirades have been well documented elsewhere, especially in this fine book by Walter Isaacson, every page of its almost 600 which I devoured in a little less than a week.  Steve Jobs always felt that he knew best, that he knew better than any other person.  And, for the most part, he did know better than anybody else when it came to transforming technology into pure fun and huge profits.  I can't help but wonder how much MORE effective he could have been if he had treated other people with respect and fairness.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I just recently discovered She & Him, I immediately ordered all of their albums !   They are musical Heaven !  I love the 1960s style of all of their music !   I really love this albums because it is a nice calm album, they didn't butcher every song and try to speed them up like every other new Christmas album.  This one actually feels like a classic Christmas album, I love it !   It has me in the Christmas spirit so much that I have already put   my Christmas tree up !    I have purchased several other copies of this album for Christmas presents,  it is the greatest !  I guess what I am trying to say is that most new artists or groups only real  intention when making a Christmas album is to make the songs sound \\" modern \\"   This is  not an issue with She & Him.  This album will be remembered as one of the classic Christmas albums some day.  I can definitely see this one being a good one to unwrap presents to !   I agree with the other reviews saying that their only complaint is that there aren't enough songs...  Maybe they will release a second Christmas album some day.   I hope that She & Him are together for a looong time !
B004W4N55C|5.0|I purchased this app at full price in August and it's a purchase that I don't regret. It allows you to search and save your favorites, which is a huge plus for me. Download and enjoy! I'm using the app on a Droid X.

0307586901|5.0|A good craft book chock full of great ideas.  I made the Gourd Candles and they were fun and beautiful.  I received a lot of compliments.  I also used the pumpkin carving tips and carved the coolest pumpkin.<br /><br />There are many craft ideas for every Holliday from Hanukkah to the Fourth of July.  The crafts are fun and creative.  But, this is not a book for beginners.  The instructions aren't always clear and the pictures are needed, so you need to be a seasoned crafter.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Check yourself out of life for 3-4 days. It is absolutely impossible to put down. Fun stuff. My 14 year old read it cover to cover, then flipped it over for a 2nd round. A great introduction into Sci-Fi. Next up, Gaiman...
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Maybe it's just me, but seeing full cell animation beats the heck out of CGI. Both formats have their charm, but what could be more charming then full animation painted by humans. And NO, the black crows are not a stereotype. They are funny and entertaining, so leave them alone. Every home should add this heartwarming movie to their collection. Lightning fast delivery by Amazon, and I did not have to buy $25. worth of merchandise to get free shipping! Amazon should keep that offer going.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I don't see what all the fuss is about. This album is artistic genius. I have never listened to Lou Reed's stuff, but this reminds me of a more metallic Door's record with them high on crack instead of LSD. I only gave it four stars though because I still don't understand why Metallica decided to do this and take another risk after \\"St. Anger\\".
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I tend not to like biograhies, but this changes everything. This is one of the best books I have read in years. I really love how brutatly honest it is. I really recomend this book.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|Skrillex is a strange beast, part dubstep, part glitch house, part prog, part well... lots of things. But it all adds up to a very unique sound that will have your sub blasting and you'll start doing the wobble.  The track \\"Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites\\" is what introduced me to dubstep and to EDM, and I've not gone back sense. What makes Skrillex unique in my opinion is the noises and ambiances he uses in his tracks. Mixing in dirty wobble bass and haunting melodies throughout, his sound is something different in the ever expanding EDM world. This album sometimes gets a bad rep for being \\"mainstream\\". But I'd say this album brought dubstep to the ears of many people who didn't even know the genre existed. Skrillex put dubstep into the limelight, can't wait to see where he goes with it next! This is a worth album for your collection.
1582701709|5.0|This book has changed my life in every possible way, it speaks the truth and I am so thankful that it was shared with me.

B004UIOUHC|2.0|This app has not lived to its promise. Is too slow. How do I remove it? It tries my patience.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Finally an app that has it all, whether you're an amateur or a professional guitarist. It loads smoothly, and the graphics are great. Wonderful for on the fly jam session,  finding the tabs to a song couldn't get any easier. A++++  HTC Incredible.  *note*  The low ratings are not deserved for this app, this is a 5 star app, all the way.
B004W4N55C|4.0|I do not play any instrument, but this is a great application that I highly recommend to anyone who is beginning and would like to learn the basics.  Some aspects of this application may still be useful to experienced players.  UI is user friendly, and the application works flawlessly.  Highly recommended to anyone who plays or is interested in playing.  Thanks Amazon.
B004W4N55C|5.0|I've been testing this app for a few minutes now and it has been written/programed very well. I don't do cover songs in my band but if it ever comes I now have something to give me a point of reference on a song. the app works great on my EVO 3d. this app is worth atleast $10 to me although I got it for free.
B004W4N55C|3.0|In terms of functionality it works well (see other reviews)  However, this app is not cheap and advertised for 'Android devices' (not especially phones).  I would be disappointed to shell out 8 bucks and get such an unpolished UI on an expensive Honeycomb device.  Hopefully this will be addressed in an update.
0316174483|4.0|My wife use loooking for this all around town and I told here I would check on line and sure enought Amazon had it. I ordered it and she was happy as a lark when it came in and the price was cheeper than anyone in town had it as well. Good job Amazon.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|Snow white is a classic, and this is an excellently remastered version.  Picture quality of the blu-ray is great, as is the remastered sound track.  Bit scarier than I remembered as a child, but nonetheless, a classic and necessary for any collector!!

B000B5OD4I|5.0|I purchased this watch off of Amazon about a month ago, and I have to say it hasn't come off of my wrist since. I don't scuba dive by any means but I've gone free diving a few times in the past few weeks, and the watch still doesn't have a scratch on it. The bezel is just great and works perfectly fine underwater, just a bit harder to turn, but it is no big deal.   The watch has kept great accuracy in the time I've had it, less than +2 minutes a week! And the day/date function is also really helpful, because sometimes I am pretty forgetful. But the watch is not only very accurate and functional, it also cleans up very nicely! Not only does the jubilee bracelet and watch fit with casual wear, but it looks like it was made to fit with a suit on.  I've received many compliments since I've owned this watch. The jubilee bracelet is very attractive looking but most of all is SO comfortable, I even prefer it to even the NATO strap that I ordered.  Overall I DEFINITELY recommend this watch to anyone looking to buy an extremely affordable, beautiful diver's watch, I know I will keep mine for a long time, and possibly buy another!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Saw Cars 2 earlier this week and I am in the minority it seems who actually liked it almost as much as the first film. After checking out Cars last night, I'll amend what I said about Cars 2 being as good and admit that Cars had a more focused storyline and was also a little funnier.<br /><br />In a nutshell, a little red race car named Lightning McQueen has issues, particularly he's selfish, narcissistic, and doesn't need a pit crew. A mishap en route to California's Piston Cup to settle a 3 way tiebreaker lands him in a lazy southwest desert town occupied by old forgotten automobiles where McQueen learns that the universe doesn't revolve around him and that sometimes we all need to slow down and smell the roses.<br /><br />Immediate impressions can be deceiving. From not having seen this film in a few years I thought its age would show against the sequel but this wasn't the case as this film still looks and sounds equally as beautiful and powerful as its successor. In my Cars 2 review I said that it looked superior to this film but seeing them side by side I'd have to take that back. Some say that this film is shallow compared to Pixar's other films but I disagree. Also, a big kudos to the characters in this film. What I mean is that the cars match the personalities they embody perfectly. Hudson, the big Buick with the big chrome grill behaves exactly how it looks, as does ol' rusty bucktoothed Mater, and my favorites Guido (Volkswagen) and Luigi (forklift). This is a great film and one that I'd rank with some of my favorite live action car films.
0060936223|5.0|This thoughtful memoir - 20 years in the making since the author's promise to Robert Mapplethorpe to tell 'their story' - is richly deserving of its National Book Award.  Good in print, this work is a materially better experience as an audio CD.  It's read by Patti Smith herself - her voice inimitable, unique and true.  It's an instrument that somehow possesses childlike qualities while still hinting at the raw, raging vocal power that is the hallmark of her work.  The way she pronounces some words is both compelling and endearing - piana, yella, fella, drawling (her south Jersey accent places an unexpected 'l' in the middle of a word that appears frequently in a work revolving around two young artists).<br /><br />Best of all: better than any poetic passage that appears of these pages (and the book is surely rife with those), it's her voice that sums up the deepness of this relationship.  \\"'Patti,' Robert said...\\"  The tone she captures in that 'Patti' is what does it for me...so much tenderness and caring reflected in those two syllables.  That word - in Smith's singular voice - will stay stuck in your head all all day.  Forty plus years on, Ms. Smith captures not only Mapplethorpe's words to her, but in one word sums up the essence of the relationship.<br /><br />I'll let other people here tell you what makes the book great.  I'm here to tell you: the Audio version is a treat to behold.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Wow, seriously?!? I just had to scroll down to see that write up myself, hahaha. First, read app descriptions. Second, download if you're serious about trying a guitar tabs app on your phone because you want to improve, change things up from how you check out guitar tabs now, etc... I'm just stating to play also. I gotta guitar a year ago and got lukewarm how to DVD's, I go online for help and recently got Rocksmith. This is a nice addition in helping me get better... Thanks Amazon for a great deal. To the GH reviewer, I love my GH and Rock Band games but put down the toy guitar and try a real one, you might like it!
B0009P66TK|4.0|In many ways, this is a perfect watch for me. I have a fair number of watches and my head is often turned by a new one. I like military style, or big chunky silver sporty watches, mostly sticking to traditional round shapes. Love chronographs. Not afraid of large. I have a few Invicta models. Let's be clear: while this is a large watch, it is NOT as large as my Russian Diver model, or even my black Corduba. No matter what some reviewers say, it's not a monstrosity. But it is large. It's beautiful in so many ways. The leather strap is perfect, with white stitching. The style here is more racing-oriented than military. The red subnumerals on the dial, the red second hand in the sub-dial and the red chronograph second hand -- all these tiny splashes of red on black give it that \\"rally\\" look for me, along with the white stitching on the band. Its case is a bit shinier than I might have preferred -- I'd like to see it in a flat finish, for instance. The one thing that bothers me, besides the shiny case, is the fact that I had to buy it as a \\"lefty\\" model. Now, I think it's great to have this version available for left-handed people! It's just that my vanity makes me nervous, expecting somebody's going to notice the crown and controls on the left side and assume I made a mistake. You know: \\"Didn't you realize it was made for lefties?\\" I do wish there was a right-handed model available. The funny thing is, having worn it now a few times, I actually like the way my right thumb can push the controls more easily where they are located on the left side of the case! So I've decided I don't care if people assume I'm just clueless -- the watch looks great and I love it, and there's a pretty good chance most people wouldn't even notice the crown being on the \\"wrong\\" side, because this isn't one of those watches so large it captures attention -- again, it's large, but doesn't seem outrageous in size. As far as I can tell, all operations are crisp and perfect. I know I have a problem, because now I'm gazing at another lefty model, a black one, with lust. Can a right-handed person get away with owning two left-handed watches? Clearly, I think so... If you like this sort of \\"rally\\" look, then this Invicta model fills that role splendidly.<br /><br />--W.D. Gagliani, author of Savage Nightsm, because now I'm gazing at another lefty model, a black one, with lust. Can a right-handed person get away with owning two left-handed watches?

B004L07KWQ|5.0|Very simple app, very simple controls, but fun to use.  I imagine kids would have a blast on this, with a tablet it is the modern etch-a-sketch.
B004W4N55C|5.0|I just don't take time review apps, but compelled today. I have used the online version. This is a great app that now lets me get tabs on the go. Awesome!
B004LZFWJO|4.0|A decent app, it can be fun, however the swiping can be a little buggy sometimes (Galaxy S).  Also there is very little replay-ability, no sequential levels to keep the user coming back.  I played it, enjoyed it, then uninstalled.
B000BYA5GE|4.0|If you are a Nicholas Cage fan you will enjoy this movie.  I found it very entertaining and informative.  This is a nice movie to add to your collection.
B00000ITOY|4.0|this toy has so many uses- sorting by color, shape , number of holes - kept the two year old busy for a while - I supervised as I am unsure how durable the pins will be - this is a good learning tool as well as a fun toy - and unique
B004W4N55C|5.0|Bad reviewers have ruined this appstore. As a developer I won't publish anything to the appstore because of the awful reviews everything gets. You all ruined it. A free app everyday but all you people do is whine. An 1 star app here is a 5 star app on the android market. You guys are ignorant spoiled brats.
B004EPZ07K|2.0|I'm not a fan of CGI and there is far too much of it in this movie. CGI just looks fake to me.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Played with it for a while just to get a feel and i really like what I am seeing. It makes me wish i had a tablet since a pgone is just to small to really read.  But, when I'm sitting around the fire and a friend wants to jam a song I dont know? Well, I will now be reaching for my phone!  Thanks for the awesome free app!
B004W4N55C|4.0|Looks like a great tab app. Looking forward to finding song on the go with it. Unfortunately the tuner crashes on my Epic when there is no sound. Looks like I'll be using my other tuner app.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Great app devs. Has all you need all in one app. You get a tuner, a metronome, a chord chart plus the search feature for tabs. It found music from every artist I searched for. 5 stars, good job.
B004W4N55C|5.0|This app is exactly what the avid and even casual guitarists need for basically everything from tabs to tuners! i have been using this app for some time and it has been great.

B001XSCRKO|5.0|These are two good movies. Great movie to watch if your are into the history of war. I personally not, but my hubby is. My fav. out of the two is Casualties of War. I have a lot of anger for the soilders who rapped the young lady and killed her. It was sad that after so many stabbings she was still fighting to stay alive. Ericson was probably haunted by her spirit after leaving the war. With thoughts of ways he could have done to saver her. I am happy he didn't let the other guys scare him to be quite about the young girl. He fought for them to be punshed for her killing.
B004W4N55C|5.0|*kidding* That was a funny typo, tho.   This app works without technical issue on the Droid 2 global and Droid Incredible in our house. Awesome app! We both find tremendous value... one of us is a trained musician and one an avid music lover. Great job, devs. Thank you!
B005KAH7QU|3.0|I liked but didnt like it but liked it but didnt. Its a hard one. I was slightly entertained but then slightly annoyed. The beginning of the movie draws you in...Alot of action but then it throws you for an annoying loophole. All in all, I might watch it again just to see if I missed something but I will pass on purchasing to keep.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|*******UPDATE******* It's clear that NO ONE likes the Ultraviolet digital copy. (Oh and to add insult to injury you can only keep the \\"digital copy\\" for 3 years. What happens after that?)  I've been in a Twitter conversation with UV_Support aka WB_Support for the last two days. After the run around, jargon and general LACK of help that they provided I did my own research and found Handbrake. It's a free and legal (as long as you don't distribute) way to make a digital copy of the film FOR YOUR PERSONAL LIBRARY. I.E. NOT to share with the world. I PROMISE it's easy. I'm not tech-y AT ALL (which is why the Ultraviolet was such a pain. \\"Wait, so I have to download two programs?? And I can only keep it for 3 years??? Wait....WHAT?!?!?!) I have a MAC and found a jargonfreehelp tutorial on Youtube. Hope this helps someone. ******Update*******  I usually don't write reviews but I wanted to make sure that as many people as possible know to AVOID the UltraViolet digital copy if they want to synch the movies with iTunes. I recently purchased a Warner Bros title and found out what a pain UltraViolet is. They \\"digital copy\\" does not synch with your \\"I\\" devices rendering the movie virtually useless.   I was completely disappointed to see that the final Harry Potter will be the UltraViolet version. And I'm glad I went ahead and bought the first seven movies this week (on sale at the bullseye store) as I've read multiple reports that WB will stop shipping them to stores at the end of 2011 in order to ready a complete, this includes everything HP, you know you want this, box-set for late 2012. I'm sure the set will include this ridiculous UltraViolet digital copy. So I'm glad the versions that are currently still in stores have the iTunes compatible versions.   While I'll still buy a physical copy of the movie when it comes out (probably off of eBay) I'll be getting my digital copy version (with included bonus features) from iTunes.   Hey WB, I know you were just trying to be relevant and get your share of the digital pie but Steve Jobs already beat you to it. Get on board and find something else to be \\"innovative\\" with.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|Discovered Genesis with \\"Selling England\\" in 1973. I was a Junior in high school. \\"The Lamb\\" (along with \\"Quadrophenia\\") defined my adolescence and were my 2, all-time dessert island albums. Through the years, I have purchased U.S. LP's, U.K. import LP's, original CD's and remastered CD's of these albums. So, with the exception of \\"Trespass\\", this is the firth of fifth time I have bought these works. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)   I've had this set since it came out (almost 2 years ago) and have listened to nothing but the 5.1 DVD's.  They are nothing short of fantastic and alone, are fully worth the price of admission. Especially \\"The Lamb\\". If we had had surround sound in 1974, it would have been dangerous. Oh yeah, there was the \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" tour.  I saw Genesis twice (\\"Wind and Wuthering\\" and \\"Duke\\" tours) but never with Gabriel. That would have been the ultimate. I did get to see Steve Hackett in '76 before his departure and got to sit in the orchestra pit at the Saenger Theater in New Orleans for the \\"Duke\\" show in 1980. You could feel Phil pound the tambourine in the pit of your stomach. I'll never forget it. Also saw P. Gabriel in 2002. Unforgettable as well.   I guess my point to all these reminiscences is; if you grew up listening to these classic albums, and you have a good surround sound system, you owe it to yourself to pick up this set.   I too wish these were actual DVD Audio discs, which would be higher resolution sound, but most people don't have the capability to play DVD Audio or SACD discs. However, these DTS mixes are pretty darn sweet.  Now it's time to replace all of my King Crimson discs with the surround versions. Have two already, and they are amazing as well. Looking forward to \\"Lark's Tongues\\" in 5.1. That will be special!
B0011X95UQ|5.0|this album is a musical study of the human condition. released in 1974 the songs still sound fresh even by todays standards in my opinion this album with its simple sounding songs are in fact very complex in the way they are structured by layering sound upon sound, creating great almost psychodelic songs.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Don't download grrrrr it keeps booting me to my home screen in the middle of a level. Please fix this

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I am a huge Metallica fan. Being an big fan I have been waiting months for this album to come out. I am am very dissipointed with it. I was under the impression that Metallica and Lou Reed were going to make an album together. All this is is Lou Reed singing and Metallica doing metal background music. I was really hoping for some James Hetfield lead vocals and some dous. And I dont know how lou Reed's other music sounds, but I dont think he can sing metal at all. It sounded like a guy talking like yoda in different pitches. It seemed like all the words and phrases were backwords and didnt make a whole lot of sence. I listened to every song all the way through before I formed my oppinion. And in my oppinio, this album sucks and is a waste of money for any Metallica fan. Yay the riffs were good, but no memorable guitar solos, badass bass lines, or drum riffs. As for Lou Reed fans, I cant really say much. I dont think his voice matches the music at all. And if he sings like this all the time and your a fan of it. Go ahead and get it. But all of my friends and I who all love Metallica have decided that this is one of the crappiest sounding albums ever. Atleast listen to one of the songs before you buy it. And I think they sound of said that the album was Lou Reed featuring Metallica. Cause this is no Metallica album. I will give it taht it was interesting to listen to once, but I doubt Ill even listen to any of the songs again.
0385484518|1.0|I really wanted to like this book and picked it up for $3 at a 2nd hand shop. I had heard about it for years. After 1 night of reading it and falling asleep in the middle of yet another chapter describing drool, and yellow toenails, and gory details of a dying man, I thought \\"it's going to get better soon\\". Every chapter was the same message-Love conquers all. I waited to see what Morrie had to say on Marriage, Culture, Money, etc. and there was nothing earth shattering or even anything with great insight that anyone would have said including my own relatives when they were sick and dying. I didn't get why this book was a best seller and why such rave reviews. This book only brought back memories of my own dying family members. Stuff I don't want to remember really. There was nothing insightful at all about this book. No real background about how Morrie kept his marriage together for 44 years. It didn't make sense to me since the author didn't seem concerned about his own marriage and barely mentioned his wife in the book. The only advise that was worthwhile to the author was about his own sick and dying brother. Morrie said \\"it will come to you\\" when asked how to handle his brothers rejection to see him. I am sorry the poor man had to suffer so bad with the illness, and I am sure he was a great teacher and all. I'm glad at least he got his medical bills paid with proceeds from the book. But I personally was disappointed. The raves were blown out of proportion.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Continuous action and mayhem - it's hard to beat the initial Transformer movie (first one) but \\"They\\" again did an excellent attept.
B005UT29Z0|2.0|I was really looking forward to this after reading reviews in the NY Times & other places. But one more time I got set up. I think I've been spoiled for inside looks at the workings of contemporary business by The Social Network. Where is the excitement in Margin Call? Where's the energy that has gotten these people to the precipice they're about to tumble off? The characters in this movie are so generic they could have walked out of an old Hollywood war horse like Executive Suite. It has a talented crew of actors but I never for a minute got the feeling any of them had a clue about the actual workings of the business they were in. A good part of the blame goes to the lazy script. The higher ups in these firms would have been well aware of the rocket scientists in their ranks because they were the guys hired to invent the very financial instruments that brought it all down. Here they're whiny junior analysts running financial models.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This story took me a long time to decide to read. I am one of those supernatural romance type people, not a big fan of the average love story. Finally, based on its reviews and the fact that my library had it for free with the online kindle program I decided to read it. I have to say that this is probably the best book I have read in... well, as far back as I can remember. I laughed constantly, and cried (both happy tears and sad tears). The way the book was written made me feel as though I was right there experiencing Anna's emotions, and it is not all about romance. And at the end, I cried happy tears.. Yes, it might have been predictable, but the story that is told in between seems so real. This book is not about the predictable ending, it's about what happens from the beginning and what it takes to get to the \\"end\\".<br /><br />My review isn't telling you what happens in the book. There are 257 other reviews and I am sure that part is covered. I  felt compelled to write this review to give it the praise it deserves. I read it twice IN A ROW because the first time I wanted to know how it all turned out, the second time I just enjoyed the ride along with Anna.  -and laughed some more-
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I only picked this book up because of the hype. It's not my normal type of reading material, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I was hooked from chapter one!<br /><br />I love the premise of the story. I love how it starts off with the friendship between Katniss and Gale, which is a great friendship. I love the fact that it seems like you're reading a book about the past, but it's actually about the future. That makes it a lot different from other books.<br /><br />And once Peeta is introduced, things really heat up. I didn't really sympathize with Peeta at first, but as you hear more about Peeta's life when he was younger and how he always liked Katniss, it really makes the character bloom.<br /><br />This book was a great intro to the series, and it made me pick up the other two immediately. I wish they'd make more in this series!
B004W4N55C|5.0|I just downloaded it and love the chord finder as much as the tabs. the other features are equally awesome for what they do! rock on!
B0036S4C6G|2.0|This book started out well but declined rapidly after the first few chapters.  It became disjointed. then dull and finally downright annoying.  Proof once again that those awarding prizes in fiction are more interested in novelty than quality.  This one is worth a skip.
0316098329|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my cousin, I am so glad she did!   I highly recommend this to EVERY reader! Great story line, you can't put   it down!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele is the most talented singer/songwriter of our generation. I've bought two of these CD's and now need to get a third. It's an absolute must-have!
B003Y5H574|1.0|I really can't understand why people are rating this movie so highly! My husband and I watched it and we found it was so boring we could barely sit through it. I'm really disappointed because I have waited for this movie to come out for months :(  Everyone knows what happens, Steve's wife leaves him because their marriage is falling apart and because she slept with someone else. Of course, AFTER they separate and Steve sleeps with someone, she's offended because apparently only Julianne is allowed to do that.   All the kids in the movie were little nutcases who will probably spend time in jail at some point. I didn't find the son's obsessive relationship with the babysitter cute, nor did I find her sick obsession with Steve to be heartwarming, either. Besides that, it didn't really drive the plot, and it wasn't funny. So the point was...? Oh and the speech at the end was so ridiculously cheesy I felt uncomfortable watching it.   The only time I laughed out loud was once during a line spoken by Ryan Gosling, but he was also an implausible character because of this sudden altruistic act where he decides to help Steve. Even the trailer showed a scene that sort of explained this (when they're in the bathroom and Steve asks for help) but the movie makes no such effort. Also, his story with Emma Stone was completely ridiculous. When is Hollywood going to stop telling the story of a cute girl who is just so different that she's able to reform a womanizing man without even realizing it? Oh, Hollywood, you are so in touch with real relationships, I applaud you.   My husband and I are in our twenties so there's no issue that we didn't understand it or that it was too racy for us. We just didn't like it. I feel like it had so many big names that they didn't feel they needed to try with silly things like a plot and dialogue.
B004W4N55C|5.0|the app of the day always takes till 3:30 a.m. Eastern time to become completely free. For guitar players this looks pretty sweet. no force closes for me and has lots of tabs, a tuner and chord assistance. not too shabby for free.
B004W4N55C|5.0|everything you need in a guitar app, tuner, chord library and biggest collection of tabs on the web. definitely worth the dl
0525423656|3.0|After Matched, which I had quibbles with but enjoyed, Crossed came as something of a disappointment. Oh, sure, I tore through it in about 4 hours -- and with a bad head cold at that. However, if I hadn't already been invested in Cassia's story from reading Matched, I'm not sure that Crossed would have kept my interest up.  The problem with Crossed? It suffers from a problem common enough in the second book of a trilogy, but more so than any other #2 in a series I've ever read. Crossed is very transparently a bridge from Matched to the finale of the series. I will give Condie that some important events happen, and some important information is disclosed. But that could have been accomplished in half the word count, if not less. The rest is padding. There are meaningless digressions that aren't detailed enough to feel like worldbuilding and aren't significant enough to feel plot-important. I have to wonder whether Condie realized there was a certain irony and symbolism in having her characters spend all their time traveling in a book that exists just to move us from one place to another.  The digressions are enjoyable, in nicely rendered prose, and the book kept my interest. But it was in no way satisfying to read. One feels as though Cassia had her big moment of growth in Matched, and Crossed doesn't change her very much. Some of the conflict feels manufactured, but at the same time, there is interpersonal conflict left mostly unexplored.  I have a feeling that when I get my hands on the final book of the trilogy, I will feel that Matched should have been two longer books.
B004W4N55C|5.0|This app is an excellent collection of tools for guitarists. Of course the tabs themselves are stored online - You don't have enough room on your phone for it all - but this makes the database super-accessible. In addition, there are quite a few great tools included that ARE resident, including chord fingerings, a transpose function, a metronome that either gives you beats or measures tempo w/ taps, and many more. Well worth the $8! I'm super glad it was on here, or I'd never have seen it. Will recommend this app to all my musician friends for sure!

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Dr. Diana Bishop is a young professor studying the history of science, particularly alchemy.  It's an ironic career choice, since the human alchemists of the past hoped to transform lead into gold and discover the elixir of life, arguably magical goals, and Diana is a witch who knows magic is real, but refuses to accept her heritage.<br /><br />During a brief leave of absence from her position at Yale, Diana is researching the illuminated alchemical manuscripts in Oxford's Bodleian library when she accidentally calls a bewitched manuscript from the stacks.  Still trying to avoid using magic in her scholarly efforts, Diana quickly studies the manuscript, then sends it back to the recesses of the library.  Unfortunately, calling the manuscript also calls the attention of the otherworld races.  As Diana is followed by daemons, threatened by witches, and watched by vampires, there's only one creature that she feels she can trust, a 1,500 year-old vampire.<br /><br />Matthew Clairmont, a scientist and fellow at Oxford, is also interested in the manuscript, but rather than making Diana feel uncomfortable or threatened, he protects and comforts her.  Unfortunately, as their friendship blooms, the other witches become increasingly angry, going so far as to call Diana a traitor and attempting to invade her mind to discover her secrets.  What began as a simple research project morphs into a race to save Diana's life and discover the truth of the manuscript, the history of the otherworldly creatures, and the path of the future.<br /><br />A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES is a fantastic debut novel by an actual historian of science.  The depth of knowledge is evident throughout the novel, and the craft is beautifully executed.  This was one of the best fantasy novels I've read in years!<br /><br />Characters: ***** 5 Stars<br />The characters in A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES are fully developed and well-rounded.  They all have strengths and weaknesses, make occasional bad decisions, and generally act like real people.  Diana Bishop struggles between her heritage and her desire to succeed based on her academic merits.  She's not a kick-ass heroine, she's real.  She's strong, loyal, and dedicated to her family and her career.  Matthew Clairmont is a 1,500 year-old vampire, something that should make him unbelievable in the real world, but somehow he works.  Slowly, over the course of the novel, Matthew's extensive history is revealed along with the structure of the vampire world.  For once, the hero and heroine are not orphaned or abandoned or ostracised from their families.  Both Diana and Matthew have loving families that do their best to support and protect each other.  They have their struggles and conflicts, but again, they're real characters with real problems, despite the fact that they're witches and vampires.<br /><br />Plot: **** 4 Stars<br />This is a long book, and it's paced more like an epic fantasy rather than an urban or contemporary fantasy, which was delightfully unexpected when I first picked up the book.  The plot unfolds gradually, beginning with a single character and setting, and leading into the more complex themes of the novel.  My only complaint is that it's a little too slow to get started.  It took a few chapters for me to become invested in the characters and the story, but once I was sucked in, there was no turning back.<br /><br />Setting: ***** 5 Stars<br />Deborah Harkness must have spent a lot of time in the Bodleian, Oxford, and France.  It's the only way to explain the depth she's imbued into the setting of the novel.  The only setting I felt was a little lacking was the Bishop house, but that might have been because it kept magically adding rooms!<br /><br />Romance: ***** 5 Stars<br />Diana and Matthew become involved slowly over the course of the novel, but their love seems to run deeper than the average fantasy couple.  They're not perfect, and they each have to learn to accept the others faults and choose to be together, much like a real marriage.  There's no sex in this story, at least not in the traditional American sense of the word, but the passion between them smolders all the same.<br /><br />Genre - Contemporary Fantasy: ***** 5 Stars<br />I loved A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES through and through.  As noted, the pacing is slower, more epic fantasy than contemporary, but it fit the story and allowed the author to create a depth that isn't always present in urban or contemporary fantasy.  I would highly recommend this as a starter novel for newbies in the fantasy genre, as well as the long-time readers that enjoy taking their time with a book.aditional American sense of the word, but the passion between them smolders all the same.

I am not sure  , The Beach Boys of 40 yrs ago would have liked this . No, i dont need any of those drugs that Brian Wilson's drug dealers gave him , thank you anyway.  But i reviewed what was released again , and i still feel the same way! It stinks ,its one step below that trash the Stone's put out around that time!  ITS NO SGT PEPPER or LOVE'S 'FOREVER CHANGES' !    If you dont have a real vinyl copy of either of those albums in stereo or mono then as the saying goes , \\" YOU HAD TO BE THERE \\"!

Sea of Tunes was a music publishing company, founded in 1962 by Murry Wilson, father to three of the Beach Boys (Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson), and uncle of another member (Mike Love), to publish and promote the original songs written by Brian and Mike.)

I love the narrative given by several different characters that is finely woven into a tapestry of a greater story. I understand why the author uses Chaucer-like bawdiness but I still think I could do without it most of the time.  However, most readers probably won't be too bothered by it.<br /><br />I now look forward to laundry and other solitary drudgery because it gives me a chance to listen to my book!

It was also nice to see more of Lady Sibyl, and how she manages Vimes. I enjoyed this book much more than the last one, Unseen Academicals- Vimes and the Watch are my favorite charcters. I wouldn't have minded seeing more of Nobby though...
B001TODCII|5.0|I have always liked Liam in every movie I have seen of his. But I did have reservations about him pulling a \\"John Clark\\" out of his fanny after his stelar preformance in Love Actually. HOLY COW! I was blown away by the whole movie.   It was real on a level that most action movies with their jacked-up, every moment a crowd pleaser, and someone getting blown up or shot up. Don't get me wrong, I do like those movies with the rest of the lemmings, but have been jonsing for some intelegance as well. Taken was the perfect blend of thinking and action + a raw look at the white slave trade in some parts of the world. I got chills just watching what the girls had to go through and was (again) blown away by his ability to show the vulnerability of the dad side of his character as well as the emotional void of the assassin.

However, I am also the size of Oscar-winning actress Linda Hunt, who now portrays \\"Hetty\\" on CBS's \\"NCIS Los Angeles.\\"  My professional dream is to become an Oscar-winning screenwriter, which I have educated myself for, despite learning disabilities and attentional issues.  Though I do hold a BA degree, all of my various former employers have thought of me as stupid; so I've only known uneducated jobs. Ms. Linda Hunt inspired me that little people can be more in the movie industry than munchkins and oompa-loompas. Dr. Temple Grandin has given me even further inspiration as someone who's \\"different\\" in the world, and knows a lot of \\"bullying\\" in life - even as an adult. Linda Hunt and Dr. Temple Grandin are two of the most powerful motivating forces to help get me to the podeum on Oscar night at some point.  Actually, they had a special table for Linda, because she was too small for the podeum.  That's OK with me.

0525423656|5.0|Crossed is a fantastically well written and fast-paced adventure that will keep reader's on the edge of their seats all the way through. There is so much that this novel has to offer and it gives the reader a whole new outlook on the Soceity itself. There are highly intense emotional moments throughout Crossed that will have reader's feeling with the character's. The qualities and depth this story and the character's possess is absolutely phenomenal and they are both written with such style and finesse that you're almost left with your jaw agape.<br /><br />So much more was tackled in Crossed than there was in Matched and it's done in such a magnifient way. It's not just a story about love and friendship, it's so much more than that. It's a story about hope, about fighting that great epic battle and believing in something so much that you would risk everything for it - including your life - however small or hard it may be. Both Ky and Xander will break your heart and make you love them so many times over and Cassia shows so much strength and heart and courage as she fights for everything she believes in throwing everything she has and is into it.<br /><br />Condie's use of classic poetry and her beautiful colorful imagery painted with words and flourishing descriptions are what make the story even more powerful and inspirational. There is struggle, triumph, fear, challenge, heartbreak, betrayals, and redemption all embrodiered into the story that follow along the many twists and turns making reader's want to see Ky and Cassia find one another and come out better for it having survived on the other side. As I've said, Crossed is a novel that packs a powerful emotional punch to the gut, that will leave reader's gasping for more.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Crossed, is that it is incredibly character driven and Condie has a way of writing in depth and layers to her character's, that make them more than just a name you're reading on a page. They seem to come alive and leap off of the page at you and it feels as if you've known them your whole entire life or you're just getting to know them and deciding whether or not you like them. They are written in such a relatable and wonderful way, that it's hard not to develop a strong sense of fondness for them and to want to root for them to survive and succeed.<br /><br />The love triangle between Ky, Cassia, and Xander is handled in such a way that it was hard not to root for both couples at certain points of the story along the way. Their paths cross, yet also divides them at the same time, keeping them apart and forcing distance between them. As secrets are revealed, the past is discovered, and the future is contemplated things are changing all around them not just from the outside, but also from the inside as well. As they struggle to reconcide these feelings, they're faced with so many insecurities, hurts, and heartache that is so real, vivid, and palpable that you could almost feel it wafting off the pages. That's poweful, when an author is able to move you to tears and then make you smile through those same tears as well.<br /><br />Make no mistake, that Crossed is not just a story about love, but it's also a story about war as well. War that is actually being fought in a very real and literal sense and war within the character's themselves as they face incredible (sometimes almost unbareable) odds and struggle to overcome them. Reader's will root for them to overcome their fears and rise up with the strength to fight for their own future, whatever it may be with whomever they choose.<br /><br />Crossed is the ultimate symbol of courage, strength, and inspiration and Condie doesn't hesistate to deliver a stunning sequel in this wonderful series.

B004W4N55C|3.0|ultimate guitar is a great site. This app.. not so much. Its not awful, but you are essentially paying 8 bucks for a glorified search engine. For that price, I would expect Tableture software, as I often use on my pc along with UG.com. This app presents tabs in a clunky notepad with no options to print or step by step thru the tabs. I am far better off going to the site on my mobile and printing them.
0385344325|3.0|While I read and enjoyed this latest offering, for me it lacked some of the fundimental Reacherism of previous trips down Reachers Road.  I have read every one of the reacher books and liked them.  Until this one I was highly motivated to read them cover to cover.  This one has left me some what less enthused.  The book just seems to lack a soul.  Reacher is more going through the motions than really involving himself and me as the reader in the events depicted.  Its like he and I are just watching things unfold around us without any real caring of how it all comes out.  There is no agrieved party. There is no great mystery to be solved.  Reacher shoots and kills a man with out any real justification and with seemingly no emotion at all.  Just kind of I pointed and pulled and he fell dead. . .. now on to the next plot event.  The only place where there is any real care on the part of the author is in the sex scenes which frankly do not do much to advance the plot and are inconsistent with previous similar encounters.  Please, go back to being Jack Reacher again.

1451648537|5.0|With over forty interviews with Jobs in person, and unfettered access to all the key players in Job's life, Walter Issacson crafts a stunning and detailed story of one of America's the most intriguing businessmen.  Issacson's success with biographies of Einstein, Kissinger and Ben Franklin caused Jobs to pursue Issacson relentlessly over a period of years to write this book.  Like most of Job's efforts, the finished product was worth the wait.<br /><br />Issacson shows how Job's feelings about his adoption and his deep immersion into the counter cultural movement of the 60's shaped his business decisions.  Job's openly credits his 9-month-long trip to India to find \\"enlightenment\\", his use of LSD and other drugs, and his obsession with Zen Buddhism with his successes.  Despite his incessant pursuit for tranquility, Steve emerges as an cold, often cruel despot (even to his own family) with an explosive temper and binary outlook.<br /><br />In the end, Job's unyielding quest for perfection in his products is shared by Issacson's search for what truly motivated Steve Jobs.  This will be an instant business classic, and is not to be missed.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|This short (6 episodes) series gives the backdrop to the original series, showing an evolution and history of the characters that was quite enjoyable.  The style -- all of the blood, gore, sex and dialog -- was retained to great effect.  Basically, if you enjoyed the first season, you will be sure to enjoy this prequel series.  One thing that added to the enjoyment was wondering how \\"new\\" character that weren't in the original series would \\"exit.\\"  This prequel series came about due to the illness and eventual tragic passing of Andy Whitfield.  His presence was missed and I give my deepest condolences to his family.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|I was tempted to give 'Beowulf' a full 5 stars based on the quality of the story interpretation, itself.  The poor animation quality of the film, however, forces me to downrate this otherwise excellent film.  Too bad because the story, both where it parallels the Anglo-Saxon classic and even where it diverges from it, is well worth watching.<br /><br />Hrothgar, as we all known, has a serious problem.  The monster, Grendel, raids his hall and slaughters his thanes.  Here we are let into the mystery and fear that our Anglo-Saxon ancestors regarded the misty unknown of the fen and marsh.  The film story diverges from the ancient tale in numerous important ways.  The poem is from the 7th Century, BEFORE the Angles, Saxons, Frisians, Jutes etc. actually invaded England in any significant way.  The story in this sense, although an Anglo-Saxon classic, is entirely pre-English, a memory of previous mysterious times.  The screenwriters take major liberties with the basic story.  They turn the story into a Viking tale.  Hrothgar and his savior, Beowulf, are thoroughly Viking figures making declarations about Norway, Denmark, Iceland [not 'discovered' by the Vikings until around 900 A.D.] and even Vinland [not discovered by the Vikings until around 1,000 AD.<br /><br />No problem.  We are actually far more familiar with the 'Vikings' than we are with pre-Viking Danes, Geats and Saxons, so the story strikes more chords in our memory.  Beowulf is the same boasting, vainglorious character that he is in the original tale...BUt...we are let into the 'secret' that Beowulf embellishes his stories plenty.  For you see, Beowulf, despite his strength, courage and beauty, is a very flawed hero just as was his predecessor, Hrothgar.<br /><br />Grendel is both terrible and wonderful.  Born of man and a shape-shifting witch, Grendel is huge, twisted and horrible.  Excluded from the society of men, he roams the trackless fen in helpless, moaning, weeping misery.  His pain is turned into hatred, violence and murder.  He slaughters Hrothgar's happy, reveling men.  If he can't be happy, himself, he will deprive others of happiness and life.  An interesting and brilliant touch is to put an old language in his throat--probably Old English or Old Norse [similar].<br /><br />Another brilliant touch is Beowulf's temptation by Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie.  The magnificent nude witch seduces Beowulf with promises of fame, eternal life, kingship, wealth, women and, especially, HER.  Beowulf is Christ in the Wilderness tempted by Satan.  Beowulf is Odysseus tempted by the witch, Circe.  Beowulf, however, is no Christ or Odysseus.  He breaks like a rotten stick and the people of his kingdom pay the price.slaughters Hrothgar's happy, reveling men.  If he can't be happy, himself, he will deprive others of happiness and life.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|I have a handful of Coldplay albums (and have seen them live a few times) and this is one of their best.  I know many fans insist nothing will ever beat \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" because nothing will ever sound exactly like it, but can you fault a band for experimenting and trying something new?  If it all sounded the same as RoBTTH, wouldn't we get a bit burned out?  In my opinion, MX falls short of RoBTTH for reasons I will explain later (I do like how they are pushing the envelope, though), but it is better than X&Y by a slight margin (with X&Y also trumping Viva la Vida).  My biggest peeve with this album is that it is too short.  But it has 14 tracks, you say...  True, but when three of them clock in at under 50 seconds, it's hard to count them as tracks (the album as a whole weighs in at under 45 minutes to boot).  Much like their live shows, when they are performing, it's great...but they leave you wanting more for your money (in terms of length).  I do appreciate how the three \\"mini tracks\\" segue nicely into their respective songs (and I understand the reasoning behind it).  It does make the album feel like just that -- an \\"album\\" -- instead of just a random collection of songs.    The album, in some ways, features Jonny Buckland really coming out of his \\"shell\\".  I almost wish he (and they) would do it more.  He's got the talent and I think some of their best stuff is when he really pushes his abilities to the limits.  The album, in some ways and at some points, feels like U2's Achtung Baby to me (spacey, \\"out there\\") and at other times feels like The Cure.  In some songs (more on that later), I get a bit of both.  Others, it is just Coldplay as we know and love them.  1) Mylo Xyloto -- intro track.  A nice build up for the next track.  Nothing more, nothing less.  2) Hurts Like Heaven -- if your foot isn't tapping to this one, check your pulse.  Fast-paced, definitely a catchy tune.  Of the 14 albums on the track, it's my fourth favorite.  3) Paradise --good song, but due to tons of airplay, this is the one I usually pass on.  Some great harmonizing with the band.  Will and Chris especially \\"play well\\" together on the \\"Para..Para\\" parts.  4) Charlie Brown -- this is my favorite cut on the album and I have a feeling if it isn't the next single they release, it will be the one after that.  Has a touch of The Cure at times, a touch of U2 at others.  Just an amazing song.  Goosebumps whenever I hear it.  The chord progression is beautiful and Chris Martin's \\"howling\\" just goes to your inner core.  My leg bobs with this one from the start until the song tapers out.  This will be a great live song for sure.  5) Us Against The World -- After the fast paced songs of \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\", \\"Charlie Brown\\" and even to some degree, \\"Paradise\\", Coldplay really puts on the brakes here.  Not a bad song, but it just doesn't do much for me.  6) M.M.I.X -- segue into \\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\\".  Again, nothing more, nothing less.  7) Every Teardrop is a Waterfall -- my third favorite song off the album.  Jonny's guitar chimes like Scottish bagpipes and when the band goes \\"all in\\" late in the song, it's Coldplay at it's very best.  The power of all four artists on top of their game at once.  Simple as it is, Will's kick drum keeps the beat nicely.  8) Major Minus --  I'm sure a lot of people like this cut, but for some reason, it never really caught on with me.  They were onto something with it, but it comes off missing a bit of \\"polish\\".  It's almost like the song was somewhat unfinished.  9) U.F.O. --  Much like \\"Us Against the World\\", it's Coldplay slowed waaay down.  Somber and slow.  10) Princess of China -- About as close to rap as you'll ever get with the band.  Chris and Rihanna are an interesting \\"mix\\", but again, I give them credit for venturing out a bit.  Catchy electro tune.  11) Up in Flames -- my least favorite cut on the album.  In my mind, it just drones on and is pretty repetitive.  Hey, everybody is entitled to their opinion, right?  12) A Hopeful Transmission -- a lead-in to \\"Don't Let it Break Your Heart\\".  13) Don't Let it Break Your Heart -- Back to fast-paced Coldplay.  Chris really shines on the keys and has that \\"spacey\\" feel to it.  Love this cut -- my second favorite on the album.  A late-album gem.  14) Up With the Birds -- Once again, slow Coldplay.  Not that it has to be fast to be good, but I almost wish they would have closed with \\"Don't Let it Break Your Heart\\".  If I could rate the album, it'd be about 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 stars.  On music alone, it would have been just over a 4...with the deduction coming for it being a short album, bringing it down to the mid-to-high 3's.
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief tells the story of young girl Liesel Meminger growing up in Nazi Germany during the Second World War. The book is narrated by Death who complains about all the work he has to do picking up the souls of the deceased during that period.   The story starts with Death taking the soul of Leisel's younger brother as he dies when Leisel , her brother and mother are travelling on a train through the snow. Leisel is left with a foster family the Hebermanns in the village Molching not far from Munich. Hans Hebermann reveals himself as one who cares deeply about people helping Leisel and showing compassion for the Jews. Hans's wife Rosa first appears as a hard character but she also shows compassion towards Leisel and later Max a Jew who the Hebermanns shelter in their basement.  As the ordeal of the war starts to have more and more effect on the people of Molching Leisel develops a deep interest in books, which she steals, and words. She is also helped by a developing relationship with a young boy her age Rudy. Rudy is a rebel who brings disgrace initially by his devotion to Jesse Owens the great black athlete. Leisel's love of words is further developed by a relationship with the Mayor's wife.  The book is a refreshing story of the fate of ordinary people during war. All the central characters care about other people but face the terrible problems of a nation gone mad with nationalism. That nation was of course Germany but who has not seen the seeds of this fanaticism even in countries like the US, UK and  Australia.  A theme throughout the book is the power of words.  Hitler, Leisel and Max all use words to great effect. None more so than however than the author Marcus Zusak .  [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]]

0525423281|4.0|Stephanie Perkins' Lola and the Boy Next Door was a nice reprieve from my usual paranormal/fantasy reads and a great way to delve back into Contemporary Fiction. This book has had such great buzz and I totally get why. It has a quirky, delightful story; charming, engaging characters; and a sweet, realistic romance.<br /><br /> SUMMARY<br />Seventeen year old Lola Nola has a pretty great life- a dazzling sense of fashion, two loving dads, loyal friends, a hot, older rocker boyfriend, a great job, and big dreams. Ok, so her dads aren't thrilled with her choice of boyfriend and her quirky style isn't a hit with everyone and her biological mother complicates things...but, overall Lola's life is peachy. Until the Bells move back in next door. Lola has a complicated and painful past with the Bell twins Calliope and Cricket. Lola must confront her lingering feelings for the handsome boy next door, deal with a less than ideal mother, and discover just who she wants to be.<br /><br /> THE STORY<br />On the surface, Lola and the Boy Next Door may seem to be just a witty, sweet romance, which it is, but it's also so much more. Lola's journey throughout this book is an emotional and realistic one. This is an insightful, meaningful coming of age story grounded in realism. This is a story that anybody who has ever felt lost, not good enough, and plain confused can relate to. And who hasn't felt that way?! Every page sparkles and shines with humor, heart, and honesty.<br /><br />The story itself is nicely paced, with a perfect mix of present tense action and past memories/events that intertwine seamlessly with the immediate story being told. The story is told from Lola's perspective, giving readers intimate and open access to her thoughts and feelings. And I really loved being inside Lola's head! The story takes place over about six months, and I love that Perkins really builds Lola's world layer by layer, giving readers a chance to get to know these people and this world. And I walked away feeling like I kind of became a part of this book for a few hours. There is something very simple, but completely intriguing about the everyday scenes of Lola's life that Perkins included in this book, such as simple but sweet and funny moments of Lola at work or Lola hanging out with her BFF or Lola and one of her dads having a heart to heart talk. I think moments like these made Lola's world and story very layered, realistic, and complete.<br /><br />One of the things I liked best about this book is how much heart it has. At its core, this book is about love, family, acceptance, and finding one's self. There are so many different, yet universally powerful, kinds of love in this book- romantic love, love between a parent and child, love between siblings, love between friends, love of oneself- and I found each of these examples of love to be quite insightful and meaningful. The emotions and feelings that the characters experience are so incredibly relatable and easy to connect with. With every laugh, tear, or angry snort, I found myself thinking I know exactly how that feels or Yep, been there too.<br /><br />This isn't a book with explosive action or a gasp-worthy climax, but it is electric in its own right. Lola's story is addictive and impossible to put down (I read it in one late night sitting).<br /><br /> CHARACTERS<br />This book is chock full of charming, compelling and dynamic characters.<br /><br />Lola is one of those characters that only come along once in awhile. She is delightfully unique, yet almost comfortingly predictable. She is bright, caring, determined, feisty, creative, endearingly quirky and frustratingly stubborn. She isn't perfect, far from it. There were times when I wanted to smack her upside her fashionably wigged head or chastise her for her selfishness or inconsiderate actions, yet, I also wanted to hug her at the same time. Her imperfections are what make her easy to love and so relatable. Underneath her sparkly, fun costumes lies an insecure girl longing to be wanted for exactly who she is...yet, even she's not sure who that is. I really loved watching this character grow and mature throughout this book. The humor, aching honesty, and unique perspective she brings to this journey of self discovery are refreshing and enchanting.<br /><br />Cricket Bell *collective sigh*. What an endearing, one of a kind teenage male character! All the Cricket swooning and hype you've heard about? It's not exaggerations! He really is impossible not to love. Cricket has a charming awkwardness, infectious disposition and a genuinely good heart. I loved every moment that Cricket appeared in this book and I only wish there was more of him. And I do think Perkins could have done a bit more with his character. There were moments when I thought perhaps his character was going to be explored more, but wasn't, or when his issues were eluded to, but not elaborated on. I suppose my only complaint about his character is that there wasn't enough of him. His intelligence, compassion, sweetness, and cute habit of rambling had me doing the swoony, sighing, big smiled, dreamy face. I'll admit it, I'm completely smitten!<br /><br />The supporting characters are fabulous! Lola's BFF, Lindsey, is too awesome with her sarcastic tongue, love of all things spy-ish, and her loyalty to Lola. Cricket's twin sister, Calliope, comes off a bit bitchy, but even when she's being nasty you can tell that there is so much more to her. Her genuine love and care for Cricket is very touching. Lola's older, rockstar boyfriend, Max, is a lot of fun to hate. He's a total asshat, but he's kind of a compelling asshat.  Anna and St. Clair are really fun characters...I haven't read Anna and the French Kiss but I really want to now!<br /><br /> ROMANCE<br />There are several romantic relationships in this book, but the main ones are Lola/Max and Lola/Cricket, and both are important.<br /><br />Lola's relationship with Max is intense, fun, and sexy. Lola is in love with Max, or at least she's in love with the idea of him. For Lola, Max represents her desire to feel grown up and free. This is a relationship that I think Lola needed to experience and readers needed to see her in because it proves vital for her development as a character.<br /><br />The relationship between Lola and Cricket is nothing like Lola/Max. Lola and Cricket have history together, a sweet, painful, complicated history. I really loved watching these two rediscover one another and kind of fall in love with each other all over again. There were times when the romantic dialogue between these two did sound a bit cheesy, but overall they're captivating togther.  Like Lola's fashion, this sweet relationship sparkles, shines, and dazzles.<br /><br />MY FINAL THOUGHTS: This isn't a perfect book, but it is an awesome book. Stephanie Perkins' talent for writing funny, captivating and magical books really shines in Lola and the Boy Next Boy. I enjoyed this book immensely and I think you will too. This is a book that you really should read!he's not sure who that is. I really loved watching this character grow and mature throughout this book. The humor, aching honesty, and unique perspective she brings to this journey of self discovery are refreshing and enchanting.   Cricket Bell *collective sigh*.

Like Lola's fashion, this sweet relationship sparkles, shines, and dazzles.   MY FINAL THOUGHTS: This isn't a perfect book, but it is an awesome book. Stephanie Perkins' talent for writing funny, captivating and magical books really shines in Lola and the Boy Next Boy. I enjoyed this book immensely and I think you will too. This is a book that you really should read!
B004NSVE4Q|4.0|I feel this book is necessary for anyone in medical school or residency.  It takes a humorous but real look at the ugly side of medicine.  I thoroughly enjoyed the read and will probably read it again once I get into my residency.  3rd year med student
B00006879E|5.0|Excellent album since the very first time you listen. Good purchase to spend some time having fun. I recommend to people of all ages...
B004W4N55C|1.0|I rated three stars but my review was deleted so now you get ONE star! How do you like them apples?
1419702203|5.0|Wonderful tribute to a brilliant musician, and a lovely man; great photos, and notes from the other Beatles and prominent people in George's life! This book has pride of place on my bookshelf!
B005IGVYUG|3.0|I must admit i went into this album with some thoughts based off of other reviews here as well as a radio interview Tom did in Australia. These things gave me the impression that Bad as Me was one heckuva roadhouse knock-yer-socks off session, start to finish. It definitely starts out that way. i was groovin and getting down. All of a sudden 5-6 songs in things change and it's \\"what's this?\\" time, \\"this isn't supposed to be here.\\" and figure it is a little lull but will pick right back up next tune. But it kinda-sorta doesn't. We get a little with Bad as Me (track 8) and Hell Broke Luce (12). Not enough. I want one wild jukejoint ride start to finish. It's not as good as Real Gone, that's a masterpiece. This one 3.49 stars, still pretty dang badass though. kudos Tom
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I really like this light.  The controls are in a good location (instead of on the bottom). And the controls are simple to operate.  Two button. Press the power button twice fast and it goes into 800 lumens blink mode - this mode will totally disorient a person if pointed in their direction. The 2nd button just controls the power of light - low, med, high and turbo.  Very easy to access, the buttons rest right under your thumb.<br />  This light has amazing throw.  It really lights up those far away objects.  It's like a spot light!  Construction is solid. No rattles.<br />  I use eneloop rechargeable AA batteries in mine.  They have worked great. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Nothing is better than the original trilogy. Can't say any thing else about it. It stands alone as a great.
B004W4N55C|4.0|This my dream finally come true. I love the app but it has some problem displaying correctly on my Acer Ionia. otherwise everything work how it should.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|This new Ryan Adams album is fantastic, almost every single song is a keeper.  I am a huge fan of his \\"Love is Hell\\" double album and this new work does not disappoint, it raises the bar.  If an album this good could come out every day, the world would have no troubles.  This isn't just a CD full of good music....this is a collection of beautiful, touching, emotionally moving songs that I will have with me forever, like a killer tattoo.  It's that good.  Thanks Ryan.
1451648537|4.0|Excellent biography that I read all night thru.  But sj would turn in his grave seeing the cheap paper and binding. Shame for someone as quality conscious as sj.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|We're tired of dark, depressing, vulgar movies.  This one is the opposite and one of Kate Hudson's best.  The other leading actors were excellent, too.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|I wasn't sure whether to upgrade to Blu-ray on this or not, so I sat down and watched my old DVD copy from start to finish to see how it fared. The very next day I discovered Das Boot was released on Blu-ray in Australia, and, selling for $13 - how could I resist! So, the day after watching it on DVD I end up watching it all again on Blu-ray and it was an absolute revelation in improved picture and sound quality.   I'd read a couple of reviews saying the transfer was only OK - it is amazingly wonderful with maybe only three or four short exceptions - notably the haziness of the green underwater scene where the U-Boat first appears. It really was like watching it for the first time. The amount of detail in clothes and U-Boat interior items is astounding. The colours (a lot more than I realised were even there) are wonderfully rich and those outdoor shots of the sea and sunsets are now marvelous.   As it is a German film, I always use the German soundtrack with English subtitles. On my old DVD the German track was only Dolby Digital Surround that sounded pretty flat and tinny. The German lossless 5.1 on the Blu-ray is also a revelation in improvement. Finally, even the English subtitle translation is noticeably improved in content and also in the timing in which they appear on screen.   My expectations of picture quality had been cautioned by reviews I had read, but I found the improvement over DVD on this Blu-ray to be jaw-dropping. Very pleased to have made the upgrade to Blu-ray on Das Boot.
0385611463|5.0|This book is amazing everyone should read it contemplate it and pay it forward ! one to keep in your personal library for future generations to enjoy.
0062011847|5.0|Snuff will make you laugh (a lot), it will make you cry (or at least feel something), and it will even make you think (if you're not careful).  As usual, Sir terry's farcical story about obviously fictitious beings in an imaginary world feels a lot more real than 90% of what is on TV or even what is happening in the real world.<br /><br />Pure genius.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|This is the absolute worst POS ever released on any recorded media in the history of the universe. There are no words to describe the violation my ears received listening to this travesty. I believe this album should be labeled as a hate crime against all humanity. Am I making it abundantly clear how epically terrible this album is? I had plenty of more colorful ways to share my horror, but I will refrain.   I wont even pretend to try and understand what these guys were thinking when they came up with the concept, but I think after being in studio for a few hours they should have realized this was the biggest mistake of their career. Metallica has been on a steady decline since \\"...and justice for all\\" and this album just proves that the band needs to just stop. Jason Newsted was smart enough to get out while he still had his artistic integrity still mostly intact, after this album I cant say that the current members can be called artists without being the punchline of a joke. If they want to redeem themselves, they need to go back to the days they were in a perpetual alcoholic fog, as it is abundantly clear their talent flowed through a bottle.  It's not only the music that has no place on the album, but I feel embarrassed for the production staff who put their name on this abomination. The production is just as disastrous as the concept itself. I have heard garage demos with better production quality than the millions it probably took to release this repugnant piece of garbage.  I gave it 1 star it's not worthy of because it was the very minimum I was allowed to give it, if I could give it a negative infinity it would still be too kind.
1416550550|5.0|This is one of the most creatively written books I've read in a long time. Yes, it takes you through three different time periods which keeps you on your toes as to which generation you are now reading about. The author superbly intertwines fairy tales, mystery,relationship interests and much more through out the book. This is never dull and I didn't want to put it down! A wonderful read to escape!!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I was not expecting to love this album as much as I do. I have come to the conclusion that Clarkson can sing anything. There is a great mix of fast and mid tempo songs, a few great ballads, and some country. I am very impressed and she seems so happy about the album, like it is liberating for her for whatever reason. My favorite mid-tempo is Dark Side but I like them all, even Einstein, it's fun and a bit silly but it fits and I like laughing when I hear it as I have had a few occasions that I would have loved to sing something like this to someone just for fun. Great Job Kelly, my guess is this record will be reviewed highly by most of the world.
1423140591|5.0|This was well wrote, for target reader. I do feel the way start could be like confusing to those who not read the previous book or the percy jackson books, but good all the same. I do enjoy how the write take the mythology of both the roman and greek cultures and combines them in way kids can learn it in a fun way.
B00328R21C|5.0|The landspeeder is cool, but the minifigures really make this box worth buying.  It comes with Luke, Obi-Wan (\\"old\\" Obi-Wan as my four-year-old son calls him), R2, C3-P0, a stormtrooper (ok a \\"sand\\"trooper which is really just a storm trooper with a shoulderpad), and some lame droid.  These are key characters in the Star Wars stories and for the price, this is the best way to add them to your collection.  I think Santa might be bringing it this year ... just a hunch.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I was very pleased to find this DVD which I could not find through catalogs, etc.  It will be placed in my favorite video.  Couldn't ask for better service, price and shipping for a new DVD.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed the game, sort of a mystery adventure game... but it was really, really short. I completed it in under an hour. I would like to see a sequel.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I heard a song from this album on a local college radio station and loved it. Took a chance and ordered the album from amazon and have one word to say - AMAZING. Reading the reviews so far I can see I'm not alone. You will find yourself listening to these songs over and over. I am now a new-found fan of these two incredible talents. Well done!
B003AHYDTE|5.0|THANK YOU SO MUCH. Bon Jovi ROCKS. I love most of his music. some of it , not so much
B005LJK3AC|2.0|Such a letdown. I was really looking forward to watching this film just to be dissapointed. With big names like Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx I thought this movie would be a given for laughs. Many of the laughs are forced, the scenario becomes greatly unbelievable and the dialogue reminds me of middle schoolers who just discovered curse words. If you're looking for a filler in the background or are easily impressed with 4th grade writing, this is the movie for you!
B00005B5L4|5.0|The biggest thing happening in high-end sound right now is computer audio, where you connect your computer to a high-quality, external digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Doing so, you can realize incredible sound quality (on par with vinyl) with the convienence of iTunes, etc. The challenge is that there is not that much popular music available in the 24-bit/96kHz format that sounds so much better than the 16/44.1 CD-quality stuff most of us already have. That's where DVD-A comes in: you can rip the 2-channel files from the discs, and load them onto your hard drive, so you can utilize your computer and DAC to play them back in all their glory.  Rumours is not only one of the finest 70s rock albums in terms of performance and writing, but it is also a sonic masterpiece, originally recorded to the highest standards. This is very apparent when you listen to it through a high-end system. Compared to most recent pop/rock recordings, which are massively compressed to sound good as MP3 files, it has a much greater dynamic range. I've done direct comparisons for several audiophile friends of this with a pristine, remasted vinyl copy played on my Rega RP3/Exact turntable setup, and everyone agrees the 24/96 info on the DVD-Audio is a very good alternative; vocals and instruments are a bit better localized, even if it doesnt have the 'warmth' of the record itself. And that's on an Arcam rDac that is one-third the turntable's price. There's the added bonus of Silver Springs, not available on the original album either. Highly recommmended!
B001HN6922|4.0|It's sad this movie is rated so low.  I am sure people have their reasons.  One reason was apparently that people wanted the movie Cars again.  Why make the same movie again?  Cars was great.  No dispute there.  But why did they have to make the same movie again?  Another is that some parents with kids felt the movie was not ok for all kids.  Fair enough.  But why rate it so low just because it was not a match for your kids?  Another complaint may have been that Mater was the star.  Why not?  LGC is hilarious.  I am not into his brand of comedy, but that doesn't mean he's not hilarious in Cars 2.  Here's why I love this movie-  * It's funny; Really  * The graphics are probably the best I have ever seen  * As a kid I loved James Bond, especially the gadgets - and that's what you get here, a funny homage to Bond  * The movie DID have a message; How did you miss it?? (for those who seem to have missed it)  * I love auto racing, especially Formula 1 auto racing (For those American who don't know F1, it's the most prestigious racing series in the world, with all those foreign names you can't pronounce taking place in cities you may never have heard of) - and this movie celebrates auto racing, especially F1  * The plot was fine - could have been better, but you can rarely have it all (Unless you are the people who did Kung Fu Panda of course, who made the perfect CGI movie - lightning rarely strikes twice like that)  Anyway, I hope the negative reviews here have not driven people away from seeing a totally entertaining movie.  Maybe if there's one thing to be learned, some kids won't like it, or are two young for it - fair enough, so maybe use some prudence there.
B00430EQK8|3.0|This album presents a series of excerpts that are supposed to be \\"highlights\\" from the opera, but that are curiously edited and fail to create an impression of continuity. It seems that as soon as we are more or less \\"installed\\" into a passage, it fades to black without warning. A little frustrating. The production, heavily inspired by the work of Robert Lepage, is impressive at first but quickly becomes repetitive and insignificant : the link between the ancient Germanic legends and a bleak, semi-technological science-fiction universe is not made evident or aesthetically justified. The whole idea seems more like the work of a tendency follower that an inspired creation. At this level of sophistication, Opera is probably too expensive to produce to be allowed to take any risks, and creativity inevitably suffers.  The singing and orchestra are impeccable, but the acting capabilities of most of the performers are extremely limited, which lead to very ridiculous overall performances. I suspect that only the most dye-hard Wagner fans could go past those pompous personifications, but then again they would probably buy the whole opera...
B0056BU3I2|1.0|I bought this for a friend who likes movies with no plot beyond car crashes, explosions, bullets flying, and women with long hair.  He loved this movie. Say no more.  I watched the movie at his house with Wall-O-Sound or whatever it is that blasts the noise at you loudly from all directions. It is used effectively in this movie. It is overused so frequently that I advised him to check his house foundation after the movie.
1400069181|4.0|Blake Mycoskie's brief book covers his struggles in launching one of his companies: Tomorrow's Shoes (TOMS).  This work is not an autobiography.  It is somewhat a company profile, almost an entrepreneurial self-help guide, and mostly an elaboration of his mission statement.    Based on a marketing One-for-One (1-4-1) notion, Mycoskie caught the charitable consumerism wave with his version of the Argentinean shoeware called alpargata, which seems to be a cross between a sneaker and a deck shoe and is sometimes known as espadrille.  In counterintuitive fashion, the \\"Chief Shoe Giver\\" translated the current sales tactic BOGO (Buy One, Get One) into the altruistic Buy One, Give One.  His startup company features selling a comfortable loafer and then matching that sale by donating a pair of shoes to unfortunate children.  Even his publisher promises to donate a new children's book to needy children for each book sold.  Mycoskie presents scant biographical glimpses of his home-life for this work to qualify as an autobiography.  His personal references reflect his journey, maneuvers, and exploits in building his company.  He includes material and sidebars about other successful entrepreneurs and charitable purveyors.  Mycoskie writes enthusiastically like a Pentecostal preaching altruism.  His corporate methodology seems to be a blend of the Golden Rule monitored by the KISS principle.  I found his section on freebies to be quite useful.  Although fervent in pontificating over the birth and the growth of TOMS, Mycoskie initially hoped that other products might find a place in this type of eleemosynary consumerism.  His final chapter prays simply that others might embrace a philanthropic passion no matter what product, service, or venture they are pursuing.  This book is an easy reader and a slight motivator into action.  I caught myself looking up local directories for TOMS outlets.  You might also.[[ASIN:1400069181 Start Something That Matters]]
0307946711|1.0|I could not get passed the first 20 pages. This story was not what I thought it would be. I hope the movie is better, at least a little better. I will give this book to someone who likes trashy novels.
B005XOPEOU|2.0|The music is fine but it's mixed and mastered so loud as to be considered defective. Frankly, their record company should be fixing it and offering an exchange. Distorted instruments are one thing. That's part of their character. Distorted mixes are a travesty. Sigh...
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I don't write many reviews and this one will be short. But GREAT movie!! Watch it! Nice and funny surprises. You will not be disappointed.   Great job Steve!
0316098329|5.0|Any book that holds my attention so well that I can't bear to put it down and when I do can't stop talking about it gets 5 stars.  Having had four children I know how difficult even rainy days in a big house can be.  Ma is a hero and surely so is little Jack.  Their relationship was amazing and their story inspiring.  Yes, there were a couple sections I questioned (the ease of the escape and the arrest of Old Nick, the pill overdose) but all in all a riveting read.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I couldn't wait for this movie to come out on blue ray/dvd. I saw it in the theatre and loved it. A fantastic follow-up movie in the Fast and Furious series. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson fits in perfectly.  If you're a fan of these movies, this truly is a must have!!
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|I have had a hard time finding a story as compelling as this since the Wheel of Time series. Some of Sanderson's other books are good but 'Way of Kings' blows the rest away.
B005IA9JZO|4.0|Last time I saw this wonderful, fun film was on fullscreen VHS or standard broadcast TV. I've always wanted to get the DVD version but never got around to it but when I saw the bargain price for the blu-ray, I couldn't resist. Watching it in widescreen, HD and with DTS-HD master audio is like watching an entirely different \\"Hook\\" experience then I remember it. I really enjoyed watching it again. It's a pretty good video transfer, not reference quality (hey this film was made in the early nineties!) but there are NO EXTRAS to be found. Not even a trailer. I remember watching a making of feature somewhere a long time ago, i'm sure there are plenty of extras out there somewhere but I guess \\"Hook\\" hasn't really gotten the attention it deserves. But anyways, it's a great bargain price and nice HD for your Steven Spielberg collection.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|The CD is wonderful. I'm a huge blues fan & Hugh Laurie knows his stuff. His desire & ability to create an album with so much depth & character was refreshing. It was an easy decision to buy one for my parents who loved it as well. :)
B005BZQVF2|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Paul\\". Opening with two Brit SciFi fan \\"boys\\" at a convention, adding a wise-cracking alien and an intense government agent on chase, and then putting in a story of compassion was not what I expected.
B004W4N55C|1.0|This app used to be the best, and probably still is in the Google Play Store. Too bad the developer has apparently forgotten about the Amazon Marketplace. Does not work on ICS or Jelly Bean devices, it crashes every time you type in the search box.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|Wow!  Upon release, I (like many others) purchased the Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE album.  Well done and the best thing considering at the time that the Beach Boys' version would never see the light of day.  And then this.  Having listened only a few times several things have stood out:  1. Consideration of what would have happended had the actual \\"final\\" version of SMiLE been released in the 60s?  Would the Beach Boys have eclipsed The Beatles as the avatars of their age (this coming from a die-hard Beatles fan)?  Would Brian have gone through what he went through?  How would Sgt. Pepper have been received FOLLOWING the release of SMiLE?  Would Mike Love have realized that \\"columnated ruins dominoe\\" is actually cool...or art?  2. The brothers Wilson, Al, Bruce, and Mike make a tremendous vocal orchestra.  Our Prayer is the best evidence of that hands down.  3. As compared to SMiLE 2004 (again, a great album)...this is IT! There are additional orchestrations that differ from that album (again, no offense to that album).  But there is something deeper...is it Carol Kaye playing bass?  Is it the harmonies of a group that were blood-related?  Whatever it is, it just works for me at a deeper level.  I cannot imagine the difficulty in Capital assembling what would be a \\"final\\" version of the album all these years later.  And like many, I have my opinions of what song sequencing should have been...but man, what if?  I am so very pleased as are my ears!
0385737955|3.0|I am going to have to agree with most of the 3-star reviews. This is simply an unremarkable book. It is lacking in almost every department that can make a novel shine. Most noticeably: character development, relationship development, humor, execution, and purpose. While none of these things were particularly bad, they were just not good. The only thing the author really succeeds at is hooking the reader by placing the characters in more and more mysterious situations one after another. You will finish the book with nothing propelling you except curiosity.<br /><br />If you think you can enjoy a book with only this to recommend it, by all means, read and enjoy. As unimpressed as I was, I will admit to staying up a few extra hours just to find out what happens next. It's a good diversion and you will find the time fly by. Again, the writing is not bad, and I am sure most people wouldn't even notice or care. But if you generally want more from a book, I would say find something else.<br /><br />If you are intrigued by the concept but have been put off by the lack luster reviews, then I would recommend [[ASIN:0140345809 House of Stairs]] by William Sleator. It has a very similar setup: Youngsters waking up in a strange environment, learning the rules, being manipulated by the \\"creators,\\" trying to fight the system, etc. Except where Maze Runner falls short, House of Stairs meets the mark and takes it further. It's a quick read, but very satisfying.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|Florence and the Machine's 2009 debut album \\"Lungs\\" was one of my favourite albums of the 2000s, a surprise collection of catchy, unique compositions very unlike the rest of the contemporary music scene (\\"Dog Days Are Over\\" is the iconic one, of course, but \\"Rabbit Heart\\", \\"The Drumming Song\\", and \\"Howl\\" also rate especially highly in my book).  Over the following two years Florence's music (despite the name, the vaunted \\"Machine\\" is there only to back her up) has become known to a very wide audience, though she missed out on the Best New Artist at the Grammys last year (though she was likewise spared the ignominy of losing to Justin Bieber).  Now the dreaded followup album has arrived, the test that many past bands have failed, consigning themselves to obscurity and the dreaded \\"one hit wonder\\" status.  Happily, Florence Welch and her crew will not be going down that road, for \\"Ceremonials\\" is very good indeed, though it feels good in ways very different from \\"Lungs\\".  On my initial listen, I didn't think that any of the songs were especially memorable, and none had the really catchy quality of \\"Dog Days Are Over\\".  However, repeated listenings and more close attention reveal the strength of the album's tracks, and I would say it probably is on par with \\"Lungs\\" overall.  \\"Shake It Out\\" and \\"That's What The Water Gave Me\\" seem to be the flagship singles, but I increasingly find that \\"No Light, No Light\\" is my favourite track.  This is an ambitious album in many respects, including sheer size; only one of the twelve tracks on the basic release is under 4 minutes (\\"Breaking Down\\" at 3:49), and several are over 5 minutes.  Let's hope for many more such productions over the years to come.
0743454537|1.0|At the end of the day, this book is bad. And the primary reason, the totally illogic ending.   For the first 300Plus pages, I was totally engrossed. The author proposed quite a dilemma. And something we should talk about. My thought, throughout the book was how much $$$$ is being spent maintaining this one person's life? Kate. At one point, the book goes into it, it is $100,000. But that is not, right. Clearly, it is in the $Millions. Yet the author never addresses, that. Instead, she goes off on this totally maudlin ending that defies reality. It was like she was trying to write a \\"movie ending,\\" but in the end, the movie ending, that was finally made from this book was the right ending.   Do not buy this book. You will just waste the 20 hours I wasted, reading it. See the movie. It is WAY better.   I am giving the book to the GoodWill.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|I was 9 years old when The Lion King originally came out, so I grew up loving it.  Now that I have a little girl of my own I wanted her to experience the joy as well.  Watching it in Blu-Ray on a flat screen TV with surround sound was amazing.  During the opening song my little girls eyes were glued to the TV.  I'm glad we bought this so we can share it with the next generation.  :)
B003EYVXVY|3.0|I viewed this movie when it was in theaters - in 3D.  The movie is very well made.  I do not like this movie.  The notion, as put forth by this movie, is that malicious corporations destroy the habitat of an entire planet.  With this story, the movie pushes the ultimate in politically correct (and wrong!) hyperbole.  And I have a big problem with the simple-mindedness of this politically correct story.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|Much buzz preceded the release of this movie. A fan of most superhero films, but not of the Lantern in particular, I skipped it in theatres and waited for the home release. I was hoping for a better experience on my own screen with the extras and multiple viewings.  Alas, while the movie was well crafted in terms of effects, it fell short on plot and emotional engagement.  Nieither the villian nor the heros particularly frightened or inspired.  The extras were indeed interesting, but not enough to keep the disc around.  I suggest buying used or renting unless you're a true Green Lantern fan.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Playing for change is cool because it comes with a DVD as well as the CD that I saw on TV.  If you've seen this special and enjoyed the wordly music and video's, pick it up, it's for a worthy cause as well.
B000006XSD|5.0|Fans have been divided on Alice Cooper's 1977 album \\"Lace and Whiskey\\" for decades. Personally, I love the way this album follows the pattern set by the previous release of a few kickass rockers, a few theatrical Broadway-type numbers, a trendy discoesque effort and a couple ballads. Alice's next few albums would also follow this formula to varying levels of success.<br /><br />The terrific opener \\"It's Hot Tonight\\" is a dirty, sweaty grind that would have been equally at home on \\"Alice Cooper Goes to Hell\\".<br /><br />Next, we get the one of the album's best in the upbeat, Phil Spectorish \\"Lace and Whiskey\\" in which Alice reveals his two vices--alcohol and women--as '60s-style background vocals la-la-la in the background.<br /><br />The equally great keyboard-driven \\"Road Rats\\" possesses fierce start-and-stop drumming, borrows a guitar line from the galloping Act I of \\"Halo of Flies\\", has a great instumental passage and has a slightly darker sound while the lyrics are an homage to the roadies.<br /><br />\\"Damned If You Do\\" has Alice experimenting with a country/rock fusion which turns out surprisingly well, even if it's not one of my favorites here.<br /><br />\\"You and Me\\" was a huge Top-Five ballad and while it is a little sappy and sentimental (for Alice), it's catchy and easy to see why millions of teenage romantics ate this up back in '77.<br /><br />\\"King of the Silver Screen\\" is an overblown, gaudy, extremely fun romp that explores Alice's fascination with old-time Hollywood (in which Fred Astaire, King Kong, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and \\"Gone With the Wind\\" receive honorable mention). Unlike the mess of some of the \\"School's Out\\" album, by now Alice has perfected the fusion of rock and theatre topped off with his tongue-in-cheek humour. Halfway through the song, his character screams \\"I'm tired of closets\\" and admits to his fellow construction workers that he loves makeup and dresses and will \\"make somebody a great little wife\\". It's a great performance with Alice projecting total liberation by its end.<br /><br />\\"Ubangi Stomp\\" is an okay rockabilly ditty--nothing special.<br /><br />\\"(No More) Love at Your Convenience\\" is disco-tinged, and even has xylophone!

B005J29HD0|3.0|Since this section is for reviews of the vinyl, and other reviewers have commented on pressing quality, I thought that I'd add my experience. The 2 L.P. set that I got as part of the 5-CD megabox was a superb pressing. I also bought the separate 2-L.P. release to get the unique inner sleeves. As some have noted, these inner sleeves are very, very snug, and it is difficult to get the records out of the sleeves. In my copy of the separately released 2-L.P. set there was a horrific-looking scuff mark across the entirety of \\"Side Four\\", AND YET, playback is entirely normal, with no audible pops as a result of the scuff mark. I'm still weighing whether or not to return this 2-L.P. set for a replacement. I could get something worse; a seemingly blemish-free set that plays crackly. I guess that I could keep my blemished(but plays perfectly) copy for regular listening, and consider the 2-L.P. set(from the 5-CD + vinyl box) to be my L.P. copy for archival purposes.....all of which may be irrelevant: I already transfered the \\"Side Four\\"(from the 2-L.P. set inthe big box set) & the two 7\\" singles(from the big box set) to CD-R, preserving all of the exclusive to vinyl tracks on the very first play.      I'm not part of the vinyl revival fad, though I've never not owned a turntable since I got my first one in 1966. These days, I only buy vinyl if there are exclusive tracks(unavailable on CD)  Your feedback vinyl lovers?
B003EYVXUU|4.0|\\"Let Me In\\" - 4 1/2 = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" (2010) is the American remake of the Norwegian original, \\"Let the Right One In\\" (2008). It is about how two misfits find each other. Owen, (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is terrorized by bullies at school, & fantasizes about revenge by playing out his fears when he is alone. His parents are divorced, & Owen just seems to not fit in anywhere, at school or at home. The other, Abby. Abby has just moved in next door, with who Owen at first thinks is her father, Richard Jenkins (who's role is called, \\"the Father\\"), who actually is not Abby's father at all, but day time protector & provider of food, namely, blood, for Abby is a Vampire. She needs someone to watch over her during the day & to go out hunting for her at night, though you'll see later in the film, that Abby is perfectly capable of hunting down her own food. So the film starts.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" is a tragic horror film, the tragedy of loneliness, the tragedy of being stuck with who you are & what you are, of not fitting in. For Owen, it's loneliness, being weak, being an outcast. For Abby, it's being a Vampire & knowing she'll never stop being one. Abby will continue to live on, while one human companion after another takes care of her needs. It is the tragedy of knowing that the one person she selects as her companion will eventually die, & before he does, she'll have to find another to replace him. For her companion, it is knowing someday all this will happen, & when it does, the pain of desertion, replacement, the pain of knowing it is over. Both film's orchestrate these themes well, but I feel the remake does a better job of it. The acting, directing & editing seems to be quite a bit stronger, & the cast is perfect, but at the same time, the original film is dubbed, & that can contribute to how well a film seems acted & translates it's story to a foreign audience. In this case, the American version seems more intimate, tragic,  just by facial expressions & body language alone. This is especially evident in \\"the Father\\" character. Richard Jenkins exudes tragedy in just about every scene he is in. His eyes speak a million atrocious tragedies that he has committed. His eyes speak a great sadness in knowing his time is about over. His, is a greatly improved role & performance over the original. Same has to be said about Owen's part, Kodi Smit McPhee was born for this role. His eyes speak great sadness, but also, great fear, the fear of the world. His counterpart, \\"Oscar,\\" in the original film, shows much anger, but his role & performance is nowhere as deep, as sad, as multi-dimensional as Owens. Chloe Grace Moretz, as Abby, brings more tragedy & sadness to her role than her counterpart, \\"Eli,\\" in the original. This can especially be witnessed in scenes with \\"the Father,\\" especially the hospital scene. Both movies had the same scene, but the American version just takes it so much deeper. You can feel their pain, you can see their pain. In the original, it seemed just like a repeated scenario for Ali. There was a little sadness, but then it was all over in a blink of an eye, without much remorse, not so with the emotional punch of the remake.<br /><br />Both films are horror films, but here, the American version has the edge again. When Abby hunts her prey, she is absolutely feral, she looks the part, due to superior make up. She moves like the part, due to superior special effects. She is the part, as she ravenously feeds on her victims. One thing though that is missing in the remake, is the more overtly sexual relationship between Ali & Oscar, where it is only hinted at in the remake, the original is fairly frank about it, especially in the scene that Ali puts on Oscar's mother's dress, & he peers in to the room, there is a quick flash of frontal nudity. There is also a scene with a long kiss between the two.  Europe has a more worldly view on sexuality between children, where America does not blink an eye seeing a child frenetically feeding off her victims, but would be uncomfortable viewing a long kiss, let alone, nudity, between the two child actors.<br /><br />Another very important part of these movies are the bullies of both Owen & Oscar. The original film bullies were just weak, as compared to the brutal masochistic nature of the American film. There is a scene where both Owen & Oscar get whipped with what looks like a metal radio antenna. In the Norwegian film, as Oscar gets whipped, it looks more like love taps when compared to the American film, as Owen gets flogged, brutally flogged, you can feel every lash of the antenna. Another is where Owen gets whipped in the face with a towel in the boys locker room after gym class. You can feel that towel whipping his face, then if that is not enough, the bullies knock him to the floor & beat on him until he urinates in his pants out of terror. Yes, there is no comparison of the bullies here between the two films, the American version wins hands down, plus Owen is terrified even to make eye contact with his foes, where Oscar seems to be oblivious of them half the time.<br /><br />Both films are very good to great additions to the horror genre, they add depth, terror, horror, sadness, & loneliness, to a rather oversaturated time for Vampire movies, that are frankly, quite lame by comparison. A drop of fresh blood, just when the Vampire movie needed it the most, in this post \\"Twilight\\" era.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for \\"Let Me In\\" is impeccable, worth picking up!off her victims, but would be uncomfortable viewing a long kiss, let alone, nudity, between the two child actors.

0743277465|4.0|I mainly bought this book to learn a bit more about Josh Waitzkin.  In many ways you could call this book an autobiography on (a few aspects of) Josh Waitzkin's life.  But primarily this is an inspirational work and it succeeds quite well in this regard.    While I mainly enjoyed Josh's flashbacks to events in his scholastic chess and Tai Chi Push Hands competitions, this book offers sound advice that may inspire you to take a bit more effort in embracing new learning situations in your own life.

B000VWOV3O|5.0|This 5-album collection is outstanding value: for less than US$15, you can acquire almost all the essential work of John McLaughlin's legendary MO in one package.<br /><br />The first three albums `The Inner Mounting Flame', `Birds of Fire' and - recorded live in Central Park NYC in 1973 - `Between Nothingness and Eternity'  feature the original virtuoso line-up of McLaughlin, Hammer, Goodman, Cobham and Laird. The later two albums feature line-up changes and the deployment of orchestral strings, and don't quite have the dynamism, the take-your-breath-away energy-burst of the first three. They're good, though, and important milestones of this busy period in the evolution of rock-jazz fusion.<br /><br />The only conspicuous absence is the later-released `The Lost Trident Sessions' featuring the studio material planned for the third album, some of which is performed live on BNAT but which is otherwise unavailable; and the lesser known `Inner Worlds', from 1976. The inclusion of these disks would have completed the package, but you'll have to buy them separately.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about mistakes and omissions in the sleeve notes offered with this package, a criticism with some merit. However, it's important to keep a sense of perspective. If you buy this package, you will acquire almost all the music of the greatest fusion band ever, on high-quality digital CDs, at an unbeatable price. If having the sleeve notes is important to you then get them off the web, or go buy the individual CDs separately.<br /><br />Meanwhile, just listen: the production quality of the sound is exemplary, like the original albums, and at this price you can't go wrong.
B005COO1X6|2.0|This is more of an initial sketch of a story than an actual story.  There is much that is not fully developed and the story is generally left with rough edges.  It's almost as if it was a story idea that SK couldn't fully flesh out so he decided to sell it as-is to make a couple of quick bucks.  Definitely not among his better works.

A must read for anyone who is looking to communicate with others better, and who isn't looking for help with that.
B00466HN86|5.0|I saw this on Friday Nov. 4 and this is a perfect addition to the Sherwood Baptist Church movie collection.   I know this was based on being a more Godly father to your children but I think that mothers can also take the messages and lessons in this film and apply them to their own parenting skills. I wish this had come out while my own children were young enough to still be at home.   If I could give this ten stars I would. Since I have the first three movies, I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I will watch it more than once.   Oh if you see it be sure to take your hanky. You laugh and then you cry.   Probably not for very young children because there are some intense scenes in the movie, drug and gang related, and some of it could be over their heads. Take your older children, definitely. They need to learn how to be good parents before they become parents.   You can find copies of the resolution the men signed at christiancinema.com.

0060837020|1.0|I ordered this book for my english 101 class in college, we just started getting into the later chapters of The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. I ordered the book because it would be cheaper then buying it at the local book store. Well, once you hit chapter 7 the book skips back to chapter 5? then keeps going to 6 and skips back to page 112. I'm missing a good 3 chapters of the book! I'm very unhappy as I expected to have the full, undamaged version of the book. Since it's closer to the end its been 30 days and they wont let me return it. I suggest not ordering from this company, as they do no check out the condition that the merchandise is in. Good Luck to finding a good copy!
0142501123|5.0|There have been several times where I have tried to borrow this book from the library, but every time I have tried, it has been out.  I suppose that's always a good sign that a story is worth reading!  We've enjoyed several of Julia Donaldson's other books, but I have to say this one might be our favorite so far.  The first time we read it, my son immediately asked to read it again... and again... and again.  I suppose many people think of Room on the Broom as a Halloween story given the whole witch-and-her-cat-on-a-broom thing, but I think it is great reading for any time of year.  A witch and her cat fly about on her broom, losing her hat, bow, and wand along the way.  Each time the witch drops something, an animal friend finds it and returns it to her, then asks to come along for the ride.  Of course there is room on the broom for a helpful friend!  When the broom suddenly breaks and the witch is captured by a hungry dragon, the friends come to her rescue once again, this time, together.  The magical ending will leave you and your child smiling with delight and wishing there was room on the broom for you, too!  The story line is as clever as it is fun, with fabulous, easy-flowing rhymes and a great combination of repetitive verses and curious moments of anticipation; perfect for young readers.  And of course, what parent won't love the story's underlying message about the value of friendship, sharing, and cooperation?  Axel Scheffler's bold, colorful illustrations bring the characters to life in a lively, happy fashion, making this book an all-around great read.

Maybe once a year I start a book and realize that the book is so bad, I am simply wasting my time by turning another page.  A Discovery of Witches is this year's book.  After reading three hundred pages of this \\"story\\" I give up. The heroine is incredibly lame and I have grown tired reading about her routine daily events. A good one hundred pages of this book is about the lead character eating a meal or being carried off to bed so she can get her rest. If there is drama or suspense in this book, I totally missed it.

B005IZLPME|2.0|I was so looking forward to watching this on my new tv.  I missed it while it was in the movies.  I'm so angry that I actually paid so much for the DVD.  My wife and I enjoy comic book movies, but this one was a stinker.  We were so bored that we thought the movie lasted three hours.    It's not like the actors did a poor job, I think it was the plot and/or the writing.  Maybe I should view it again, which I'm sure I will.  This could have the same effect on me as did The Fifth Element.  Hated it the first time I seen it, but liked it after watching it a couple more times.  I'm slow like that.  LOL.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|I was very pleased to get this movie as I have horses and love the stories of horses with heart.  The film was well done and I throughly enjoyed every moment. I have been to the Kentucky Horse Farm an was fortunate enough to see this horse in person which for me makes the film vevn mors enjoyable.  The only dissipointment was the format of the DVD, it was supposed to be the wide screen version but was not so some of the picture was lost at the edges. I would have paid more for the correct format.
B005JSM5YW|3.0|The title for this film is a solid choice: CRAZY, STUPID LOVE is. Thought he reviewers and the general public alike seem to rank this as one of the greatest films of the decade, for some other viewers this seems tired and trite and a faux showcase for some excellent actors to overcome a tawdry story. Writer Dan Fogelman (Cars, Cars 2, Tangled, Bolt, Fred Claus, etc) may be taking a step up from his previous work and that is a good sign, but when directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have shown their sensitivity in the much maligned if not sadly ignored treasure 'I Love You, Philip Morris' it feels odd they should go for this script.<br /><br />Difficult to classify as a Romance or Comedy or Drama the film falls into the familiar category of a RomCom. Opening a film with an embarrassingly public announcement of a marriage dissolution over a wife's infidelity and dissatisfaction with her nerdy but good father/provider husband this story embraces about every situation about falling in and out of 'love' imaginable. The idea of a monogamous clueless husband being 'changed' by a smooth talking, much bedded lothario isn't new nor is the 'finally met his match' idea fresh. The manner in which the children of the couple respond with their own needs and damaged outlooks on relationships works OK, but the manner in which the in the process of divorcing couple work through their problems holds a mirror up to today's marriages. The stories surround us in everyday life: the film merely magnifies them.<br /><br />It is always amazing when the marquee boasts the names of some of our more interesting actors as being involved: Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, et al deliver what they can. The 'star' is Steve Carell according to the script, and you have to like the caricatures he creates to relate to him here. There are some fine turns in cameos by Emma Stone, young Jonah Bobo, and Liz Lapira; when they are on screen the film lightens up. But in the end it is a two hour formulaic condensed television series type story. And yet the Bravos from the audience must mean there is a craving for this type movie.

B005AUWXZ0|1.0|Saw this movie in the theatre with our son.  It was the first time we took him with us to the theater.  Cars 1 was great and had a lot of good messages but this movie was all about politics and pushing an agenda on the younger generation.  The plot of the movie was weak and seemed to me that the storyboard was centered around brainwashing children that oil is bad.  My boy still enjoyed the movie because he was really still too young to pick up on the political agenda and just liked watching mater fly around with a jetpack.  I have to say this video will fit well in your collection if you're a bleeding heart liberal and are planning on raising your children to be also, otherwise i'd say skip it.  It seems like the folks at pixar are trying more each time to leverage their grasp on children to push their views on society.   p.s. to the writers at pixar,   I know this is silly but it still bothers me every time i watch wall-E when the captain's wheel tilts the spaceship IN OUTER SPACE all the people go sliding across the floor.  Explain to me how the artificial gravity system in that ship works.

The characters are well written and you can here the dialouge in your head! Love the book.
B001CC7PKS|2.0|This is a terrible movie, and a terrible adaption of the comic. I thought I'd give it another try because I saw it when it first came out, and thought it was stupid. I thought I might have been distracted or something. Wrong, I was right the first time. The \\"director's cut\\" is supposedly better, but that's not saying much. It fails on all levels, and I fell asleep halfway through the second time I watched it. Even though I collect comic book movies, I regret buying this.

The main characters were interesting at first but were poorly developed.

034552554X|4.0|This was a different book for me, but I liked it. At first, about 1/4 of the way through, I thought I wasn't going to like it with all the descriptions and over usage of flowers used in communication. However, as the story continued and there was less of that and more building of the story, I started to like it more. I liked how the author vacillated between the character's childhood and adulthood and how they diverged to make the story complete. The only thing I would have liked to have seen was the character wanting to  embrace more of a normal life toward the end. Up until the very end, she was still compelled to live in empty rooms sleeping on floors, and in parks under bushes. Interesting concept using the different meanings of flowers to convey the feelings of the different characters to each other rather than the spoken language.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|After using QuickOffice and Polaris on my android tablet and Docs to Go on iPhone, I was so excited to have the opportunity to test this out for free (via Amazon app-a-day)!  All of the other apps have failed in a big way when it comes to powerpoints. I receive my school lectures often 15 minutes before class and I am unable to convert the ppts to pdfs from my tablet... So i MUST have a document app that allows me to add speaker notes to a powerpoint.  Quickoffice is very clumsy with ppt and Polaris crashed and lost several of my notes before the most recent update (and I am too nervous to trust them right now).  OfficeSuite has not let me down. It has not crashed like the other ones did all too often and it has a very simple yet powerful user interface.  I have also tried the word documenting function and love that it has paragraph editing (indentations, line spacing).  Plus page breaks and other options like that. It seems to be a lot more powerful than most word document editors on androids and iOS.<br /><br />At least for the Asus Transformer, this has been the best Office substitute I have tried. :)

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I have read books two through five and without a doubt this book is the worst of the series.<br /><br />Dany T. become a confused teenage girl after leading successful victories in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" it is like her character regressed. Again, though I don't think Martin understands women, like many male authors when writing to develop a female character in depth he fails.<br /><br />Tyrion actually is subdued and boring through out the entire book. The active and wise character of the first three books become very boring in this book, but toward the end you can see the old Tyrion working to become a player in \\"The Game of Thrones.\\"<br /><br />Jon Snow actually becomes so interesting, I actually went back and read his parts I skipped over in \\"Clash of Kings\\" and \\"Stomr of Swords\\" very good in fact the best part of the book. Yes we all are wondering what will become of him, but if I know Martin when one hero falls, another rises.<br /><br />I am anxiously awaiting what happens with Jaime, Brienne, Arya, Victorian Greyjoy, and Queen Cersei.  I think after the Epilogue which by far is the best and most amazing part of the book, all chaos is going to break loose in the very said but very cathartic \\"Winds of Winter.\\"<br /><br />Overall the book lacks any good flow, it seems chalky and it is his worst written book of the series. The language isn't there the beauty of the first four books isn't there and I doubt he finishes this series. I think his passion may be gone for it, and he doesn't seem to be the type to finish just to finish  .  we shall never know what became of Westeros . .  we can only imagine and that to me is the greatness of Martin.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|A Feast for Crows, book #4 in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series is a great work of English literature and continued Martin's great writing.<br /><br />The book is a good transition after all the action of the first three books, Martin in sort of an \\"Act IV\\" calms things down, explains things and looks back and looks ahead into his wonderful \\"Song of Ice and Fire.\\"<br /><br />The books focuses on on the goings on in \\"King's Landing, Dorne and the Iron Islands.\\"  The weakness of this book is no one cares about Dorne or the Iron Islands. The Iron Islanders are nothing more than Vikings, and the Dornish are extremely boring and backwords.  Dorne is the weakest of all the seven kingdoms and the most boring. The Dornish sort of remind me of the American Southwest going from New Mexico to California the food, climate and ethnicity reminds me of Pre Colombian America. A great addition to the story.<br /><br />The writing is smooth and flawless.<br /><br />The look into Cersei's psyche is amazing and the tribute, the book has a real feel of Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales.\\"<br /><br />The Septon traveling with Brienne and Podrick really tells you the average life during the \\"Dark Ages\\" and the misery and plight of common life during that time.  Also the Arya stories have a real \\"Charles Dickens\\" feel. The Martin is a smart as he is sly.<br /><br />The book is the after math of the War of the Five Kings and Westeros is healing and preparing for winter.  The Boltons control the north, the Freys the riverlands, Queen of Mean Cersei rules in King's Landing and the Dornish are working to get back in the \\"Game of Thrones.\\"<br /><br />The book is very essential to character devlopment and actually made \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" more tolerable.<br /><br />Cersei's development is light year ahead of Dany's in \\"Dance with Dragons.\\"<br /><br />Also it introduces a new villain a man very powerful and very evil  Euron \\"Crow's Eye\\" Greyjoy . .  he's as evil as Roose Bolton and Cersei Lannister.<br /><br />Check it out folks!

0062060554|4.0|This was one of the best novels I have read in quite a while. Others have described what the book is about so I will get straight to the point.  The negatives: It was painfully obvious that this was the author's first attempt at a book and I blame the editors for that.  There where quite a few holes, etc that should have been taken care of during the editing process.  We are asked to stretch out imagination far too often as readers. As another poster mentioned, the writer is surely a male.  The physical description of Christine and her body were way off.  This bothered me. Even the fact that she dressed in tights every day pulled me completely out of the story to the point I had to sit it down.  A woman without a job to go to would not be wearing tights or pantyhose of any kind.  They are uncomfortable.  Christine would dress in a more comfortable fashion.  I was impressed with the idea of the diary/journal writing, but it was at times confusing and I would have to flip around the book trying to figure out what was going on because it was not clear.  The positives:  The suspense was definitely there.  The writing style was definitely original.  The story-telling was compelling and thought provoking.  The book had twists and turns that kept the reader guessing and wondering what was going to happen next.  The ending was satisfying even though toward the end you could see it coming.  I was thoroughly entertained by this book, and isn't that the point?!
0553381695|5.0|Very good. I read Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe, and this book is a classic. The language is flawless the styles of English Lit are perfect. The symmetry and balance are as flawless as a sword of Valyrian steel forged by Gendry Storm.<br /><br />The story starts off with a Comet and keeps on going. You get to learn to hate Melisandre.  The book focuses on the War of the Five kings (even though six are in it) in Westeros. The War leaves the continent in a damaged state and a huge power vacuum (See Crows and Dragons).<br /><br />Stannis Baratheon is bewitched by an evil sorceress named \\"Melisandre\\" who looks like a red headed version of Ice T's wife \\"Coco\\" she is a priestess of a pagan god named \\"R'hllor\\" who is worshipped in a similar manner to the pagan god \\"Moloch\\" found in the bible's Old Testament.<br /><br />She deceives Stannis into going to war against House Baratheon and House Lannister. Stannis ends up getting his behind kicked and his forces left in ruin in the most epic battle in the five books, \\"Battle of the Blackwater.\\"<br /><br />Tyrion is hand of the King and keeps Joffery in line. Joffrey is a jerk who has Sansa Stark constantly beaten and insluted.<br /><br />Robb Stark is not in the book in a major way, he does make two major mistakes that lead to cause him more problems.<br /><br />Theon Greyjoy, Robb's buddy from \\"Game of Thrones\\" goes to the Iron Islands and realizes his dad Balon has made himself King of the Iron Islands now that Robert and Ned are dead.  The Ironborn sack the North, Theon meets a dude named \\"Reek\\" on the way and Reek turns out to be a real monster.<br /><br />So the Ironborn sack the North, House Lannister merges with House Tyrell and House Martell to seal up their power and the Eyrie stays out of this mess.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dany T. is in Qaarth learning about mystery and prophecy and sees her future as possibly the savior. Her dragons are growing and she is starting to make some ruckus.<br /><br />Tyrion Lannister is the hero of this book. \\"Halfman, Halfman.\\" He saves King's Landing and House Lannister. He is awesome and the writing flawless.<br /><br />The Night's watch goes deep into the North and comes across Wildings and Others . . things are changing north of the wall.<br /><br />Mance Rayder a former member of the Night's Watch is now King of the Wildings with Giants, Mammooths and Wargs he is ready to come south of the wall because he knows, \\"Winter is Coming.\\"<br /><br />Again, read this book . . it is amazing . .

B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Nosferatu (1922) is the movie that started it all when it comes to the making of countless Dracula movies over the last nine decades.  Even with it being a silent film, this movie has withstood the test of time, a victorious copyright infringement lawsuit from the estate of Bram Stoker, and a nearly lost musical score.  This movie is an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula (1897), but numerous changes were made to the story, including Count Dracula being called Count Orlok instead.  Even with it stealing from Stoker's novel, this movie is an all-time gothic vampire classic with lots of creepy scenes and atmosphere.  Max Schreck plays the vampire in such a creepy way.  I think the Salem's Lot (1979) vampire was inspired by Max Schreck's vampire, as they look very much alike.<br /><br />The musical score by Hans Erdmann fits well in some places, but in other places it doesn't fit the scenes well.  This could be because a lot of the score was lost.<br /><br />Overall, this is a classic that can be enjoyed if you like your horror very gothic and creepy and don't mind watching a silent movie.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I'm not really a big comic book or action film person, but this movie definitely drug me in and kept me captivated. I had low expectations for it and it definitely surpassed anything I might have thought. The acting was well done and I thought the plot and the progression were phenomenal. Definitely would recommend seeing this film. One of the best action films I saw this year.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Very awesome app! Thanks for offering it for free!!! I've always loved the web version...This is so neat to have a phone app. THANKS!!
B005COO1X6|1.0|I'm going to say that annoying thing everybody says: I'm a big fan of Mr. King's. But this little gobbet of story merely touches road rolled over thoroughly in A Buick 8. The child protagonists generate sympathy and some tension, but not enough to be worth money, in my opinion. I just felt ripped off when I finished it.
B002NZV68U|3.0|Do you still have any beloved object from your childhood? Maybe a memory?  OK, take that object or memory, stick it in front of a green screen, amplify the color, jazz up the songs, get big name actors to play everyone, add a dark neo-gothy bend to it, make the jokes snarky, and make it REAL slick. Then I want to you to agree with everyone who was born in the last fifteen years that the new one is WAYYYY better than that old fashioned object or memory that you held dear.  They do that to everything these days and they've done it here. If I'd never seen the original as a child I'm sure I would think this is 'cool', but should Wonka be 'cool'? Can't he be warm, endearing, mysterious, and not so threatening? That's probably my largest contention with this work. Depp's portrayal is so cold and callous that it seems as though his character hates children. If all Wonka's work is just to spite his father then perhaps he does, and that's an interesting side to the story but it doesn't make me feel closer to the character- it feels more like seeing a dangerous animal in a glass jar. This Wonka reminds me of a Gothic Praying mantis. Do I really want to buy chocolate from this man?  It's apparent Burton is a fan of the original (why remake anything unless you love the original?), but he is such a creative guy that I have to ask why he chose to tackle this project? Why not write his own classic? Was this a studio decision? I like many Burton projects but this one just seems an unnecessary one.   This version isn't the worst thing ever to come out of Hollywood (I think that credit might go to \\"Made of Honor\\" with \\"27 Dresses\\" running a close second), but it's just not my taste. I prefer the original.
B00005QBUK|5.0|I'm not a big audiophile.  I don't need a pair of headphones that make feel like I'm in a club or that show off the brand. I think that Dr. Dre Beats wearers look rather silly myself. But what I do need, and have, in this headset is a pair of headphones that sound good and that don't constantly come out of my ears when I'm running. Nothing beats this pair of \\"over the head\\" headphones as I like to call them. They'll last a long while as long as you don't step on them or accidentally cut the cord. (that was a stupid thing to do). Anyway, for 8bucks you can't go wrong. They'll get the job done and you won't look like you're looking for attention.
0307272702|5.0|I've been researching nutrition for the last few years. This book puts everything together for me in a way that makes absolute sense. It answers so many of my questions and makes me feel like I really have a handle on the, \\"why's\\"- which is something I need in order to confidently make decisions. It makes sense, it describes many studies that have been done in the last 150 years (for the info geeks like me), what has happened to our beliefs regarding fat, and what to do to lose it, keep it off, and even be healthier. I highly recommend this book.
1451648537|5.0|Great bio.  Very inspirational and, at times, emotional.  But the author lacked the credentials to write the biography as this would have meant a very deep understanding of the computer industry and the environment around those days (as it manifests in how he treats Bill Gates and other giants of the time).  But what has been captured is significant - Steve was very mean, he was a genius, he was obsessive about the functionality of the products, the way they looked, the emotions they evoked, and also that every product should be great - both the parts that the customers can see and those they can't see.  Steve credits it to his father who was a carpenter with similar view point.  But it was the Greek Phidias (who did the statues on the roof of Parthenon) who on being asked why did he spend so much time on the rear side of the statues which no human being would ever see remarked \\"Gods can see them\\".  Steve cheated his co-founder Wozniak of a share in a consultancy contract, and as late as in 2000s he backdated options and cheated the shareholders.  We also see that the genius and evil are sometimes so tightly woven that we can't uncouple them without damaging the other (would we prefer a nicer Steve and a world with no iPods?.  When Lady GaGa was asked does she ever think of getting herself checked with a psychiatrist, she tellingly remarked that treating her eccentricities may result in effecting her creativity as she feels both are intertwined inextricably).  Overall, a must read - but are there any lessons to be learnt? - read and carefully choose them (obviously, don't backdate your options - people have been jailed for lesser crimes - and you are no Steve Jobs ;-)) .
B004EPZ070|2.0|The plot is described well enough in the overview and reviews of other viewers. The movie is a watchable, especially for woman, sitting by tv all by herself with some ice-cream. Story that can happen, still characters are rather week, especially Dexter and scenario lacks depth.  However, I watched it and even would give it three stars, if not the last minute of the movie.  If this would end up to be Ethan  which is character played by Krasinski  it would make it all more or less good and logical, at least for romantic comedy/drama.  But when you see who you see - there is no any twist, it doesn't make sense, you can not help but feel sorry for Rachel.   So, you can watch it - but it was total disappointment in the end.

B0052GACNM|5.0|Wow, old Tony still has what it takes to make an album. This album is a great chance for some of us older folks to get acquainted with younger singers. I was surprised to hear what a talented siner Lady Gaga is. Her rendition of The Lady is a tramp is energetic and fresh. The duet with Aretha is heart rending. After almosy 47 years of marriage I know that answer to the question How Do You Keep The Music Playing!! Amy Winehouse...what a voice!k.d. Lang and Tony singing \\"Blue Velvet brought back memories of my young adulthodd. All in all, I think this is a fantastic album and would be a great gift to anyone, but most especially anyone over 55. Of course, the young folks will enjoy it too.
B005P89F1C|5.0|This is not the usual rehash of Christmas carols to make a few more bucks off your popularity; it is an impressive, creative output, chock full of gems. If you're  expecting bubble-gum pop, you may be disappointed. Justin Bieber is primarily a Rhythm and Blues artist and it's the anchor genre of this album. Proceeds going to charity is nice, but there are plenty of selfish reasons to get this CD.  My thoughts on the songs, in CD order:  Only Thing I Ever Get For Christmas  An R&B make-out song.  It's OK.  Mistletoe  A fun, reggae-beat song with a catchy melody.  The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire) featuring Usher  If you like Usher, you'll like this very R&B version of the traditional.  Santa Claus Is Coming To Town  Bieber gives this carol a little rock & roll fun and throws in a little Michael Jackson.  Fa La La featuring Boyz II Men  An instant classic. A magical, cheerful love song. Boyz II Men weren't involved in writing it, but Bieber must have written it with his boyhood idols in mind, because it is perfectly suited for their gentle harmonies. A song you'll turn up the radio for.  All I Want For Christmas Is You Remix - Duet with Mariah Carey  Best of both worlds: something old and something new; you get a repeat of Carey's fantastic rendition along a fresh new one.  Drummer Boy featuring Busta Rhymes  People will either love or hate this song. Innovative and over the top, think a marching band's drum section playing next to a revving-up jet engine, interspersed with rap and the actual Drummer Boy lyrics. JB at the drums, of course.  Christmas Eve  Written with Chris Brown and easily my favorite song on this CD.  Bieber's R&B vocals really stand out here. This is another radio turner-upper (if it can make it onto corporate radio's playlists).  All I Want Is You  A great pop apology song. For another artist, on another album, this could be the centerpiece and stand on its own as a Top 40 single release. Here, it is overshadowed by the blockbuster songs.  Home This Christmas featuring The Band Perry  OK, here's that C word again: a new Classic, a great country Christmas love song. It's about waiting for a loved one to come home in a snowstorm, but it could easily be about missing a soldier who is at war, or about any separation and longing. If you listen to country, you'll be hearing this one played along \\"Christmas in Dixie\\" and \\"Hard Candy Christmas\\" every year.   Silent Night   - done right. This has to be the way this song was meant to be sung: Bieber performs it with a serene reverence and a simple piano accompaniment that gives it the feel of a gospel song.  Christmas Love  No particularly memorable hooks or catchy melody here, but a pleasant pop love song.  Fa La La (a capella)  A capella version. No accompaniment, no problem.  Pray  A repeat from a previous album. JB has a right to be proud of this song, and it fits well with the theme of the album.  Someday At Christmas  One of my top 3 picks from this album and alone worth the extra bucks for the deluxe version. It's his 2007 live, uncoached performance at a singing competition in his hometown, apparently cleaned up and paired with an accompaniment in the studio. And it's a performance worthy of joining Stevie Wonder's original in the annual Christmas music rotation, now that it is officially released. Man, what a voice, what a talent!

1423140591|3.0|While Riordan has maintained quality and interest over his long series of Greek, Egyptian, and Roman myth, this book takes a huge dip. It was like reading a first draft that hadn't had time for much needed revision. Far too much telling rather than showing. Things that appeared to help the heroes along felt not only convenient but even contrived. (MINOR SPOILER) to fill in background information, one character suffered from flashbacks -- until that wasn't needed anymore, than the character is cured! While all of this is my reaction as an adult fan, the two middle schoolers who were reading it at the same time had a more succinct verdict: \\"It is sooo boring.\\"
B001LM1456|5.0|The Incredible Hulk and Captain America were the only two comic book movies I had no desire to see. Well, I gave Captain America a try today and thought it was good. I figured I'd do the same for the Hulk and I am floored by how much I loved it! It had the right combination of everything: action, suspense, humor, drama, romance, etc. I could go on and on but the bottom line is you just have to see this movie for yourself. It's well worth the money.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|One of the best books i have read in a long time.Heartwrenchingly sad but a story that needs to be told.I thought about it days after it was finished.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|I was never very interested in Captain America, thinking he's just a strong guy who waves around a boomerang type shield. I now see what the \\"fuss\\" is about and this movie has turned me into a fan. I have seen quite a few movies starring Chris Evans and this is probably the best acting I have seen from him. The rest of the cast is very talented and don't disappoint. The storyline was easy to follow and enough action to keep my interest. It also seemed to blend very well with the other Marvel movies (the biggest one obviously being Iron Man). I'm not well versed in the comic book world but overall, I think this was a great movie and I'm glad I finally watched it.

0440246008|5.0|This was my first Lee Child Jack reacher read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the scenes in England and the descriptions of Norwich, a place I've visited. Child captured them well. The hook is great at the beginning and I was vested throughout this thriller. I'll definitely check out another in the series.
B00003OSU4|5.0|Extraordinary documentary captures the magic of the 1958 Newport Jazz festival, featuring performances by such jazz, R&B and gospel luminaries as Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, Chuck Berry, Anita O'Day and Dinah Washington.  There are too many highlights to name.  Indeed (if such a thing made any sense), the entire film is a series of highlights.  A few of the standout performances include Armstrong's extended Dixieland set, O'Day's playful interaction with her musicians, The Chico Hamilton Quintet's haunting \\"Blue Sand\\", Jackson's powerful musical version of the Lord's Prayer, and best of all (in my opinion at least), Dinah Washington's scorching  rendition of \\"All of Me\\".  That one performance alone is worth the price of admission.  One of the best things about this film is that it doesn't stick with the performers alone, but constantly turns its attention to the fans.  The audience is as diverse as it could be:  black and white, ages ranging from infants to middle-aged, teenagers in tee shirts and blue jeans and older folks in suits and pearls, all swept up in the magic of the jazz.  It is a reminder that once upon a time, at least, music had the power to unite people.  My only complaint with this film is that it is WAY too short.  It should have been twice as long as it is.  I didn't want it to end!  This one is a must-see for any fan of music--jazz or otherwise.  It makes you wish you could have been there in person.  Too bad this DVD is not available at an affordable price.  Someone release this again!  Please!!

0393338398|3.0|Michael Lewis's Moneyball is not a homerun, but it's good for a couple of extra bases.  A triple if you're a baseball fan (maybe an inside the park homer if you're a fanatic!), a double if you're not.<br /><br />The book, which chronicles the 2002 Oakland A's season, absolutely does provide an intriguing inside view of the workings of major league baseball.  It struggles, though, from a paradoxical case of TMI (Too Much Information) and NEI (Not Enough Information).  And it fails to adequately expand its fascinating central premise into something that is slowly, but steadily, becoming incorporated into the way that smart companies do business:  throw out preconceptions, develop new and more meaningful ways of measuring performance, implement, measure, repeat the cycle.<br /><br />Baseball, Lewis points out, is a ship whose hull is so heavily encrusted with the barnacles of superstition and untested tradition that the speed with which it can move forward is significantly impeded.  Up until Billy Bean (whose fascinating biographical info is worth the read in and of itself) is saddled with a team with few stars and little money, the major league solution to the encrusted hull was to simply apply more horsepower:  more money, to buy bigger stars.  With that solution not available, Bean and a small but innovative crew, get down to the business of carefully scrutinizing what REALLY counts when the goal is to win.  Stealing bases is out.  A walk is as good as a single.  A batting average of .300 with a low on-base average is not as good as a batting average of .240, but a high on-base average.  In short:  science comes to baseball.<br /><br />The TMI:  though the book is a short one, it is repeatedly saddled with long descriptive scenes that serve more to show that the author had quite a bit of face time with baseball VIP's,  than they forward the thrust of the theories that the author (very valuably) wants to bring to light.<br /><br />The NEI:  the premise of the book, that baseball has for a century been shackled with assumptions about recruiting and strategy that are actually counterproductive (in terms of winning games), is a powerful and extremely thought-provoking concept.  But it's way too big of a concept for an author with a wide-ranging mind (see his book The New, New Thing) to limit it to baseball.  My field (I'm a family physician) is also deeply barnacle-encrusted with \\"expert opinion\\" that often obliterates good solid evidence to the contrary.  Faced with diminishing resources in the face of sky-rocketing healthcare costs, the best outfits in healthcare are applying precisely the same principles that Michael Lewis details in Moneyball:  develop MEANINGFUL measures of performance, retool to obtain those meaningful measures, be willing to trash popular healthcare myths if the evidence doesn't support them (e.g. breast exams and prostate exams do NOT save lives, routine physical exams are largely useless, prostate and breast cancer screening, in the best studies done to date, may have caused more harm than good).<br /><br />Lewis, in Moneyball, uncovers this:  most businesses operate on principles that are time-honored and  so ingrained that when you attempt to deviate from them, you are ridiculed at best, and fired from your job at worst.  But then someone like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg comes along, insists that there is a different way of looking at things, and the rest is history, much to the detriment of Microsoft and My Space, respectively.been shackled with assumptions about recruiting and strategy that are actually counterproductive (in terms of winning games), is a powerful and extremely thought-provoking concept.

0385738773|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best I've ever read. It's actualy my favorite along side The Uglie Serries and The Hunger Games Trilogy. It's unique. Liek any author Dashner has a signature about him. The ending is unexpected yet perfect. I definetely reccomend it.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Instead of waiting 27 days to get the uk version pre order it on itunes.I don't know why they would invent ultraviolet digital copy.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|got this game during a free app of the day. definitely worth paying for it if you are looking for an old-school type of RPG.
B002LC2DQ4|3.0|Good memory, but did not find higher capacity, that I see as a problem on Olympus cameras, buy it as an extra easy to carry but does not fully comply with if made, whether the camera do not see it as recommended. It is not part of this analizis but I think necessary to mention.  Regards
B0058EBNAO|4.0|it's a good weather app with extra data and multiple locations I really like it.  even when you own an app it's your option whether you use it or not this is 1 app that I continue to use.
B004W4N55C|5.0|I got this from the FAotD. I can say I've never seen such an amazing app come through Amazon for free. This is a very well designed app. Looks and works great. Droid X.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I just finished all levels with perfect.  I love this game!  Give me more levels.  I must have told a dozen people about.  Simply buy it if for no other reason than to give incentive to make me more levels.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|For fans of the HBO show 'Rome' this box set is a great purchase. The entire package looks great and the DVDs are held in a sort of \\"book\\" that even has a bookmark so you can easily access the DVD you want. The DVDs themselves are a little thin on extras - nothing you won't find from DVDs from previous Season sets - but visually this box set really does credit to the show itself. Recommended for a gift or a personal purchase.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Now THAT pairing would truly be Avant Garde!  I think if Metallica & Whitney Houston were to record an album full of schmaltzy tunes like 'Nothing Else Matters' it would have to come off better than this train wreck.  This thing makes the Load/ReLoad pileups sound like The White Album.  Etc.  Lou Reed to cut an album with Erasure?    Seriously, all joking aside.    Succeed or fail, I'm all for musicians pushing the envelope and trying out new things.  In fact, as a fan of both Metallica and Lou Reed, I was genuinely intrigued when I heard about this project.  However, after a few spins, all I can say is thanks for trying gents, but other than 'Little Dog', which isn't horrible (I guess), most of this is monotonous, nondescript, or just plain unlistenable.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Just bought the CD. So far, I find it mesmerizing, Very slightly reminiscent of Depeche-Mode, but with an amazing female vocalist. Still delving......
B004W4N55C|3.0|This has the potential to be a truly great app, but has too many shortcomings at present. Feature-wise, it's a slamdunk 5 stars, except these features aren't fully compatible with Honeycomb tablets as of yet. Make this app fully functional on Honeycomb and remedy all of the display issues andthis app is awesome. Even with it's shortcomings, it's still worthwhile and a steal as Free App of the Day.
B005DHC6R0|4.0|While maybe not as excellent as some have written, this is not bad at all. He may not have his brother's voice but he can write better tunes. The only slightly irritating thing is that like Bead Eye it is extremely (extremely!) Beatles-derivative. Now if you like the Beatles this may well be ok but it does lack somewhat in originality; this is where someone like Paul weller was and is quite different: he was able to get hisinspiration from the same sources  but without being so close. Otherwise it is a nice listening experience, quite pleasant.
B005NKIQ26|3.0|I'm sure that anyone who loves Justin will have this album on repeat for the rest of the year. However, I don't expect to hear any songs on the Christmas radio stations except one, and only because you have to have one song off of the new album on the radio. Except for 1 or 2 songs, the whole thing is very urban, and not really what I was expecting from Justin, and the only reason Mariah Carey makes an appearance is because she's under the same label. This is not a good album, but it will go platinum just because of who he is and how many people have Bieber Fever. I ended up giving it three stars because most Christmas albums usually do only have 1-2 good songs and the rest is just filler because they would rather sell an album than a single, so I guess it's par for the course.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|The third season was somewhat of a letdown since after having been a really fun series, Chuck had started taking the spy stuff to seriousls. Season 4 changes all this and the series is back on track, even if at times it may be mroe action oriented and somewhat less comedy oriented. But it is very good nevertheless.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|If you enjoyed Blood and Sand, you will love Gods of the Arena.  The story telling and drama are simply amazing.  The extras are interesting, but the featurettes seemed a little bit short in my opinion. But for the price you can't really complain.  The show looks astounding on Blu-ray.  John Hannah is simply amazing as Batiatus, and Dustin Clare does a nice job with his role as Gannicus.  Gods of the Arena does an excellent job of telling the back story of the Ludus and how things were before Spartacus arrived on the scene.  If you are a fan of the series I would definitely pick this up.
0307460444|5.0|Very informative. Color photo's of every recipe.  This is my new cupcake go to referrence book. Recipes are excellent too.
B00005JNS0|5.0|There wasn't enough time for this movie to arrive before we flew down to Fla. for the winter. I was so happy to see it arrive promptly down in Avon Park, Fl. because it is a Christmas gift and it's here in time to be mailed with the other gifts. Your service is truly appreciated.  Mary Jane Rettig
B000S9C8M6|5.0|Sure this album is more radio-friendly than their previous releases, but that doesn't mean it's simpleton pop trash.  Most of the songs seem to have the same arrangement formula (soft verses, heavy chorus, choir section after 2nd chorus, etc.), but damn it, the melodies and music are catchy.  I can't get these songs out of my head.  These guys are amazing composers making great music, and that's what's important.
B005XOPEOU|1.0|If I compared this album to Waits new Bad As Me, (as they both came out about the same time) I'd say, Bad As Me is a classic, and this is simply  big sounding zone out nowhere stuff.. No real grooves, no melodic lines, nothing that grabs you. Big sound that imitates some of Brian Wilson's approach, but without any harmonies or melodies or contrast that grabs your ear. One reviewer here said he loved a big sounding album....so do I, but it's got to have big content too. If I want big, I listen to Barry Adamson. Or The Book of Eli soundtrack. Or Hybrid.  If I want great synth, I listen to Wally Badarou's Echoes cd, If I want great pop, I listen to Ciba Motto. Or both pop and synth, Hats by The Blue Nile.  If I want true great songs, I listen to Boz Skaggs Speak Low, or David Sylvian's best work like his Snow Borne Sorrow CD, or 40 of the cream of Tom Waits songs. He has that many. (Tell It To Me, Get Behind a Mule, Soldier's Things, Barbershop, Foreign Affairs, Hang On St. Christopher, Alice, the live Midnight Lullaby, Strange Weather, Johnsburg Illinois, Heart Attack and Vine, Innocent When You Dream, Step Right Up, Raised Right Men, Lost In The Harbour, I'm Still Here, Tell It To Me, Picture In A Frame, Chocolate Jesus, Take It With Me, Georgia Lee, In The Coliseum, Widow's Grove, Pay Me, and all of Coppola's One From The Heart..Waits oscar nominated score. Jeez, listen to the Empty Pockets suite at the end of the second of that CD (not on the first issue) ..the reissue with the new black trim cover and shot of the Vegas street...an unbelievable piece of music.<br />Coldplay seems like fun for a big concert to gas on, but when you're raised on the Allman  brothers, The Grateful Dead, Miles Davis,The Stones, Dylan, Waits, James Brown, Count Basie, Pat Martino, Jobim, Crosby Steals The Cash, Joe Cocker, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, Bill Evans, Otis Redding, The Drifters, The Beach Boys, Eric Dolphy, Sly Stone and on and on.....Coldplay's wall of sound just doesn't cut it.esn't cut it.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Sweet app! The best free app I've seen so far on amazon. A great app for any one who plays guitar.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I had high expectations for this case due to the high volume of very positive reviews. My expectations were exceeded. I am very pleased with this purchase. Hopefully you can find it in stock! Just keep checking back (I checked every day for a week until it came back in stock). AmazonBasics are my favorite. High quality generic goods for a low price. Nice, simple packaging too.   While everything is good, they should have included at least two screen protectors (not just one). It really does take practice to get the perfect fit. Amazon should also sell them separately. Also, It would be nice if there was a version without the concentric circles on the back, but in person they look better than I thought.  The case is not super easy to put on and off. In fact, it can be quite difficult. My advice is this: put the top of the phone into the case first, so that the buttons don't get damaged by the amount of force necessary to put the rest of the case on.
B004W4N55C|5.0|This app works great on my EVO. A few problems I had were my own, with one exception being the low accuracy of any tuner app. I payed full price about 4 months ago and it definitely does the job. One problem I had though was paying 3 dollars for just the tabs app then seeing this come out a few days later, but I thought oh well, and downloaded this one too. I mostly use it for the metronome and chords library, both great features.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|Music is eclectic,fits movie perfectly. I'm middle aged, but like some of the songs very much, others, not so much. Interesting groups, very good young singers!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Bought this for an Asus Transformer. Game plays just fine. Only negative is the end level animation, which as others have said before, does slow everything down to a crawl. The tablet is brand new (3 days old) so I would have to believe it's just something that will have to be lived with. Otherwise, the graphics and gameplay are awesome, mini versions of my favorite game of all time.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Here's an actual review of the BD itself. I always get the most blinged-out copy available on BD. I have not had need for a digital copy as of now. So I'm going to tell you about the film and the special features because everyone else is glossing over it all because they don't get their digital copy.<br /><br />>>>I am not slamming those who are yelling about this... I'd be pissed too if I needed the digital copy.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />So, the extended version may only increase the show time by a mere 8 minutes, but it is a 8 minutes well placed. The family scene really made a huge difference for the movie. As it should, because it had been a huge central theme in the comics leading up from rebirth to Blackest Night. I remember watching GL in theatres and being a little underwhelmed in terms of my fan-boy expectations. My first viewing of the Extended Cut struck just the right vibe for  me.<br /><br />First, the BD has Focus Points, literally focusing in on the various paths to complete for the movie as a whole. Broad points on design of the fan favourite characters and the planet Oa, make up for the Guardians. The whole process of the dogfight. Basically mini-featurettes. And well done at that. There's a lot of cool backgrounds on the film's nuances, and no repeating of material. These also explain why some elements were played around with, and by watching these, you can see the sense of it all. Thumbs up for that.<br /><br />Next up is an in-depth look at the history of the Green Lantern/Hal Jordan character, core concepts of the character's rebirth. Then, we have a few scenes from the coming Green Lantern animated series. It is a bit too stylized for my tastes, but it looks intriguing given that the Red Lantern Corps and even the Blue Lanterns show up regularly. And it ends with the fastest recitation of the Oath, ever.<br /><br />It's a good overall package for the film. This isn't the best super hero movie so far. It is a good solid start to what we can only hope will be a great franchise. There's a dirty word called 'potential'. It says that the effort isn't quite up to par but it might be if they tried harder.<br /><br />Here's hoping they try harder next time.ope will be a great franchise.

B004DTXJ4S|1.0|As a long time fan of both the games and the movies, I was anxious to see the new movie after the ending of the last Resident Evil movie.  I was sorely disappointed with all aspects of this movie.  The plot was quick to make major changes in the beginning then shifted to a slow moving plot throughout the middle, and finished with the worst ending of the series that I have seen.  It was done to completely set up for another trivial sequel.  Although the plot makes Alice \\"human\\" again, she seemingly is able to do her same \\"kick butt\\" moves and heroine action.  Again, a let down for me.
B0055IU4GM|4.0|It's nice to see the Master getting back to what he does best. Writing tunes that bring out the emotion and feeling that resides in that great big heart and soul of his. This is one fine album by Mr. Hiatt. My only detractor (for me anyhow)is that it's just a little tiny bit too 'country' for me. I'm not a country fan by any means, but if I gotta hear anything remotely country, John Hiatt is the way to go. I've got every album John has ever done, and this is among the top five. What a genius he is, and how lucky we are to have him.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I just want to say that this movie is amazing. I have never been so it to a movie. I have been singing and trying to dance to every song. I have played footloose at least 150 times in the past week. The movie, the music, and the dancing is all amazing in all aspects of the word. WAY TO FREAKING GO!!!!!!!!!!
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I go to concert filmings as a hobby. I like picking myself out in the crowd shots. I was close at the U2 360 tour Rose Bowl show and U2 Vertigo tour - Chicago. I saw the Time Machine tour five times; three times on the first leg in Milwaukee, Chicago and St. Louis, and again in Chicago and this show in Cleveland on the second North American leg. I was sitting in the first row of the upper section next to Alex and wore an LED equalizer shirt that lit up and had a built-in mic that reacted to the music in my continuing shameless attempts to appear in concert videos. I could see me here and there in the video, just under the circular LED lighting truss over Alex.  Rush took a calculated risk filming this show. Most concerts are filmed over two nights. They shot this in one night. Good move - I think it kept them on their toes. They were on their game for this performance. Probably one of the tighter shows I saw this tour. Saw it this past week at the local multiplex and was pretty impressed. One of the better Rush performances captured on video.  The crowd was energetic. They had a grid of wedge-shaped lighting trusses mounted over the entire audience, which were lit most of the show. Think \\"Show of Hands\\" on steroids. More light thrown on this crowd than other rock shows I've seen filmed. Adds a new dimension to the show on video as the moving lights over the audience were in sync with those over the stage. The editing was done at reasonable pace.  My personal favorite was \\"The Camera Eye\\". I read somewhere that Geddy thought the song was \\"too dated\\" for inclusion in previous tours. He was surprised to find that he really enjoyed playing it on this tour. This song got a strong response from the crowd each time I saw it played. I think it is personal favorite of many Rush fans. Juxtaposition of the rear videoscreen cityscapes intercut well with the live performance. They really nailed it here. Geddy knew it too when he let out a yell and threw his hands up at the veryend of the song. Lightning captured in a Blu-ray bottle.  They had a camera mounted underneath this motorized mini-blimp they flew around the venue. The camera is lower resolution than the other hi-def cameras and made for some interesting shots. Hand helds running around the audience captured one amazing air-drumming performance after another. Many songs end with a wide shot taken from the nose-bleed seats in the rear upper deck. The venue was small and it makes for a nice panoramic view they return to often.  Highlights include a blistering bass solo by Geddy to finish off \\"Leave that thing alone\\". Geddy also hits the high notes of \\"Freewill\\" as if it were 1980 again. The \\"Moving Pictures\\" section works well as each song is framed and intercut with their backing video.  Every conceivable angle of Neil's always-excellent solo is covered as he amazes us mere mortals with his awesome display of muscle memory hyperdrive.    Geddy is shown mouthing along to various dialog samples he triggers throughout the show. I never really noticed many of these live, but it's pretty funny in the video. You can always tell how well a Rush show is going by the looks they give each other on stage and the faces they make when they flub something. Alex is once again quite the mugger on camera this show as he thrashes through the setlist with his usual intensity. Neil never misses a stick.  I thought they had a great light show this tour. Everything looked and sounded great on the DLP video projection system I saw it on, so crank it up sit back and experience rock nirvana as the LED chase patterns streak across the undulating spider-like legs of the main rig during \\"Vital Signs\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" - It's a beauty way to go.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Wow... I was blown away by this... I had to buy this as soon as it came out. I think the director did a really good job! Thanx for the awesome movie!
159514188X|5.0|This has to be one of the best young adult novels I have ever read. The author tackles such a sensitive and delicate (and often taboo) topic in such a caring, understanding, and straight-forward way. The novel is absolutely heart-breaking - you want to grab them all and shake them sometimes. I read the book in about 4 hours, couldn't put it down. Absolutely mesmerizing. Highly recommend for ANYONE who works with young adults. And every teenager out there should read this.
0385344325|5.0|When Lee Child is on his game - when he leaves the politics behind and delivers stories as lean and mean as his stoic Jack Reacher - there is no one better; no one that can match Child's clean action and unambiguous storylines, or go toe-to-toe his larger-than-life hero, while so effortlessly executing the perfect escapist entertainment.  Rest assured, Lee Child in on his game - big time - in \\"The Affair,\\" a classic that easily could have preceded early series greats like \\"Killing Floor\\" or \\"Tripwire.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, \\"The Affair\\" is a glimpse into the past, starting with Reacher recalling that day in 1997 when he walked into the Pentagon as a soldier for the last time.  A woman has been brutally murdered in podunk Carter Crossing, Mississippi - the site of an Army Ranger training base, currently under the command of a US Senator's son.  Reacher, still a major in the Army's military police, is sent undercover to keep an eye on the locals and the progress of the MP officially sent to make sure the Army's reputation is kept clean.  Reacher takes off for Carter Crossing with only his fold-up toothbrush and his thumb, and soon meets unlikely town sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux, daughter of the late Sheriff, unattached, and an absolute knockout.  Reacher's uncover ruse is quickly discovered, but rather than sending him home, Reacher gains Deveraux's trust, who decides to keep Reacher around to help out on the investigation.  And other things.  It turns out that there is a pattern to these murders, the latest victim the third, and all terminally attractive.  Reacher also learns that Deveraux, once a Marine Warrant Officer, has a bit of a mysterious history, adding some intrigue to what appears to be a pretty straightforward mystery.<br /><br />The Reacher we're reintroduced to in \\"The Affair\\" is as menacing as he's ever been; an avenging angel with few inhibitions, no use for \\"feelings,\\" and little remorse.  As always, Reacher spares no violence on dispatching any thugs and miscreants who get in his way - regardless of which side of the law they stand.  But in many regards, fan's will revel in Reacher's coldly calculated mayhem that is perhaps more brutal, the usual, though certainly as efficient.  While Child never lets the prose get in the way of a good story, he paints neat pictures of a \\"slick city, laced with wet streets, boxed in by low buildings painted muted pastel colors, heaving and bustling with furtive and unexplained activity.\\"  Child keeps the level a few notches above typical guilty-pleasure pop filler fare by stuffing the pages with Reacher's observations and calculations, from muzzle velocities to the mechanics of a severed femoral artery, timed with freight trains and midnight sex more torrid than the Mississippi nights that barely conceal them.<br /><br />So if the story weaves predictably in and out of conspiracy, leaves little to the imagination, and is not afraid to offend - who cares?  There will always be Oprah or The National Book Club awards for those who care more about political correctness than improbable but redeeming violence in their entertainment.  It's good to have you back, Jack - and you too, Lee.  Bravo.t in his way - regardless of which side of the law they stand.

B004AHNIGM|5.0|The blues for sure but there are some shagging songs to. Especially track seven. Gregg and T-Bone please get back to the studio....
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I realize that reviewer Mr. Man has already done a review which assesses each track. However, I felt his review was somewhat off the mark and, being a big Coldplay fan, I decided to write my own review, below:  First, a quick summary of the album overall. Mylo Xyloto stands on its own as the next evolution of Coldplay music. I find it a very enjoyable album that initially sounds quite different from previous Coldplay music (I had the same feeling with Viva la Vida). But after listening through it a few times, I realized that the old Coldplay themes are still there. The earnest, hopeful, occasionally intriguing lyrics. The beautiful mix of rhythm and electric guitar (or piano). The ability to straddle the line between popular and kitschy music without straying too far into the latter. As with X&Y and Viva la Vida, Coldplay continues to introduce electronic and synthesizer effects - which are occasionally excellent, but oftentimes could use more work. While not my favorite album that they've produced, Mylo Xyloto is still fun to listen to.  1. Mylo Xyloto - 3.5/5  Just like Viva la Vida, Coldplay opens their album with a gorgeous non-lyrical track. It sets the tone beautifully for the transition into Hurts like Heaven. Performed live, I don't see how it could be used any other way, due to its short length. Still a nice piece, but why did it need to get separated out from Hurts like Heaven? A strange decision.  2. Hurts like Heaven - 5/5  My favorite song on the album, hands down. I am going to go skiing this winter while listening to this track on repeat and am anticipating being transported to a different spiritual plane :) Seriously, though, the quick tempo and the guitar skills of Johnny Buckland combine to make this an ethereal, infectious track that gets under your skin quicker than any other song on the album.  3. Paradise - 3/5  Many fans will like this one, although I find the grinding electronics and halting beats at the start of the song and the bridge turnme off pretty quickly. There's something about the lyrics (\\"para-, para-, paradise\\") that annoys me too. I do like the introduction of the string instruments (a la Viva la Vida) and the reference to a song later in the album (no spoliers here!).  4. Charlie Brown - 3.5/5  Initially I was unsure about this track. I found myself thinking \\"Are those Alvin and the Chipmunks I hear in the background?\\" And the beat seemed like it was made for young children. But after listening through it a few times, it began to grow on me - the track does have a childish quality, but in a way that is more like an adult reminiscing about childhood, rather than a song to be sung by children...  5. Us Against the World - 4/5  I liked the sound of this one - it harkens back to some of Coldplay's earlier works. A nice mid-album slow track. Some great lyrics are to be found here \\"the devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes\\" is a personal favorite.  6. M.M.I.X. - 2/5  This track 49 second is so quiet, you might have to turn your speakers up to make sure the album hasn't stopped unexpectedly. A single note carries through the whole song, with odd airy refrains tagged on. It does make for a transition into Every Teardrop, but they might have done better to rearrange the tracks and leave this one out.  7. Every Teardrop is a Waterfall - 5/5  Fantastic song. This was one of the first singles to come out, which is too bad - a little like seeing all the jokes in the trailer to a comedy. Still, the scoring is excellent. The sound is rich, the lyrics are moving. Expect this to be on Coldplay's \\"Best of\\" album that you know as well as I do will be coming out a few years down the road.  But, from here on out, I think the album has peaked and never really hooks you back in again. Which is a pity, because the remaining songs really aren't too bad. Except for...  8. Major Minus - 2/5  Maybe it's the fact that it's right after Every Teardrop, but this song is just kind of grating - I often skip it when listening to the CD in the car.   9. U.F.O. - 3/5  Another throwback to Parachutes and some of Coldplay's earlier works. A decent mood song.  10. Princess of China - 3/5  The most intriguing thing about this track is that Rihanna and Coldplay got together to make a song. That sounds like a promising concept, but Princess of China doesn't make the grade. The track's lyrics of jilted lovers singing to each other  doesn't quite add up to hear Chris Martin and Rihanna sing it, and comes off sounding somewhat awkward. Again with the grating electronic music, too. The potential for this duet goes sadly unfulfilled.   11. Up in flames - 3.5/5  A lovely track mixing piano and slow-paced electronic drumbeats. For some reason, I get the feeling Chris Martin's voice is straining too much on this track, which slightly disrupts the melodic swaying feel it has.  12. A Hopeful Transmission - 2/5  Another non-lyrical track that starts to make you wonder. Really? Three non-lyrical, less-than-a-minute tracks in one album? To me that feels like driving away from the drive-thru and realizing they forgot your fries. A fourteen-track album should have fourteen full tracks. And not feel like a rip-off...  13. Don't let it break your heart - 4/5  A great penultimate track. After some of the drudgery of the last few tracks, this one starts to feel like Coldplay is heading towards a good conclusion of their album. The rich, powerful sounds serve to tie in the earlier sounds of Hurts like Heaven and Every Tear.  14. Up with the Birds - 3/5  Coldplay has a pretty good history with closing tracks (\\"Everything's not Lost\\" on Parachutes, \\"Amsterdam\\" on Rush of Blood to the Head). But this track seems more like \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" on X&Y - somewhat at odds with the rest of the album. There are some weird themes going on (I'm reminded of 60's musicals, Pink Floyd, and Alfred Hitchcock movies). It's not terrible, but it doesn't conclude the album quite as well as some of last tracks of previous albums.  One last bone to pick with the band. Why did you have to pick a name that nobody could pronounce? The only advantage I see to this is as a party conversation starter...just so you know, you're not being clever.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I heard the whole album few weeks before it came out.<br />Its not the kind of album you get into right away.<br />For this 2 cd set of lulu It will grow on you.<br />The view became a great example what these 2 legends have in store.<br />Yes I'm a metallica fan. Sometimes different is a good thing.<br />5 stars for a dare challenging bold move with this gem.<br />Haters can suck it !
B005XI94HY|3.0|I have to say that I am disappointed in this album. I was really looking forward to this, but when I started listening to it, I wasn't blown away. Where is the quirkiness that was in \\"Lungs\\" that made it stand apart from other albums? Don't get me wrong - Florence has a beautiful, talented voice. But all these songs sound the same. I didn't really notice when one song ended and the next began. I found my thoughts drifting away from the music; there was nothing to hold my interest.   I will continue to listen to this and I hope it grows on me, but I will preview her next album before rushing out to buy it.

B00004RJ71|4.0|The Price was awesome (4 dollars), the DVD was brand-new, worked perfectly, and came in 8-10 business days.   The only problems were:  1. There's no movie-booklet in the DVD case - even though theres a holder for one  2. The quality of the movie was closer to VHS than DVD  3. The subtitles didn't work.   If I had known all of that in advance, I might have sprung for a more expensive copy; but overall, for what I paid, it's a decent deal. As far as the movie itself goes -- it's a definite classic. cop that, son!  P.S.  Gimme some chon chon

1451648537|5.0|Just finished this longish book, and found it one of the best books I've read in years. I'm the same age as Jobs, so I can well recall all the tech history that took place, at least from a novice PC user/consumer. My first PC was an Osborne 1! Not surprisingly, there were dark aspects of his personality, and his management style did not fit conventional wisdom at all - yet Apple has been incredibly successful. And despite his downsides, can you think of any other CEO who would draw such an incredible outpouring from employees and customers following his death? I certainly can't, especially these days when CEO's are mostly reviled.   There are technology geniuses and there are creative geniuses, but having both embodied in one person is a rare kind of genius, that's what set Steve Jobs apart, as the book makes clear. A unique mix as the author describes \\"His passions, perfectionism, demons, desires, artistry, devilry, and obsession for control were integrally connected to his approach to business, so I decided to try to write his tale as a case study of creativity.\\"  A wonderful read indeed...

0553386794|4.0|First off I must start with a disclaimer - I am not a fantasy junkie, not even close. The only thing I've ever read which would even qualify is The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series. So maybe that means I am coming to this series with a less informed but also less jaded opinion in terms of the genre. But after reading and enjoying A Game of Thrones, and getting on here to peruse some of the reviews, I am mystified by the number and viciousness of the one star reviews this book has garnered. Of course no book (or movie, or song, or whatever) is going to get raves from everyone. It's simply a matter of taste. But who are these haters of Thrones/Martin and where is all this vitriol coming from? They seem to fall into two categories: feminists who think every book which contains a rape scene or two must be a mysoginistic screed; or Pollyannas who want nice, pleasant, predictable tales of valor, love and honor where the good guy prevails in every circumstance. Well, obviously Martin provides neither of these scenarios, but at times I think some of the reviewers here must have read a completely different book than me. Several reviews rant about \\"no likable characters\\". Really??? None of the Starks are likable, or worth rooting for?  Tyrion Lannister isn't worth your time? I think he's one of the great fictional characters I've encountered in many years, complex, unpredictable, and often just plain fun.<br /><br />I think Martin's world creation is quite believable, with great depth and wonderful contrasts. One thing I could do with less of is his overdone descriptions of clothing and banners and House lineages. This is the only time I find myself skimming. In these instances he could use a judicious editor peering over his shoulder and wielding a red pencil to the manuscript. We get the point already, George, you've put a lot of thought into the history behind all this, but sometimes less IS more. I find his characters well drawn and individually delineated, their motivations are clear and if occasionally they do something a bit stupid or arbitrary to push the plot in a certain direction, I haven't found this - at least so far - to be a major flaw or distraction.<br /><br />Well, to all the haters out there, all I can say is there's no accounting for individual taste, and certainly you can't please all the people even some of the time, so just go back to reading your White Knight/Black Knight stories, and I'll pick up the second book and start reading.clear and if occasionally they do something a bit stupid or arbitrary to push the plot in a certain direction, I haven't found this - at least so far - to be a major flaw or distraction.

B003FNLZ62|2.0|Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~<br /><br />The Bell Jar written by Sylvia Plath is a book that I'm very glad toward mt current Literature teacher for pushing me to read. It examines how too much pressure from society can a young woman. She spirals through a long journey through which realizes she has never done what she has wanted in life but what others wanted. This pushes her to descend into a dark abyss of painful despair. It is a sort of psychological classic type book. Sylvia Plath is remarked to have this book as her crowning achievement. She wrote some other books as well<br />and tons of poetry. I'd say it is an ok book for those into this genre. I liked it but it isn't one of my favorites.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Alas, we finally get a U.S. release of the Beatles original mono LPs on CDs in a great box set.  These are the essential LPs from the mono years that reveal the true essence and brilliance of the Beatles' recording process from EMI and Abbey Road Studios, and more specifically the sheer genius and vision of Sir George Martin (the Beatles Producer).<br /><br />Most importantly among all of the included albums is the legendary \\"White Album\\" discs (officially titled \\"The Beatles\\" although it was one of their most individually pieced together works and one of their least united efforts).  Perhaps that reveals the passion I have for this particular LP, especially in monophonic recording.  This is the first time Americans have had the White Album issued in this format (as Magical Mystery Tour was the last U.S. pressed and issued Beatles album that was recorded in mono format).  A must hear for all White Album lovers, especially if you have never heard them in mono.  The same goes for Sgt. Peppers album in mono.  John Lennon always insisted that \\"the only way to listen to Pepper's is in mono.\\"  You WILL hear the difference from the stereo version.  The different mixing channels and original recording methods quickly reveal themselves through the speakers.<br /><br />I love this box set and the sound is so beautiful to my ears.  Love The Beatles in MONO!  I strongly encourage you to invest in this box, especially if you love The Beatles and want to hear them in their purest form.  Enjoy the tunes...<br /><br />Cheers, Gary
0307594777|2.0|I just listened to it on audiobook.  It's riveting, to say the least.  If you want an entertaining trip, read this or listen to it or whatever.  Sadly, the content is rotten.  Sadism.  Subtle and not so subtle digs at people who think homosexuality is wrong.  Situational morality.  If this is what contemporary Sweden is like, I fear they are not going to be relevant very much longer.  Something's rotten.  The author tries to convince us that the protaganist is neutral in spite of his leftist social views, harmless in his promiscuity.  He does condemn violence against women, but if there are no fixed moral absolutes, why should anyone refrain from causing pain if sadism feels good to the inflictor?
B0055CJ8T2|4.0|The title of, Kelly Rowland's sophomore album Here I am, promises great things and to some extent it delivers. Unlike her previous albums, this one is a more solid cohesive effort. This album is more thematic and speaks to relationships whether with others or yourself. The four themes that popped out to me were embracing your sexuality; coping with heartbreak; and  being comfortable in your own skin (i.e. self-love and self-appreciation)  Let's take the album track by track:  * I'm dat chick - this song is a bold statement of intent. Ms. Kelly uses it to great effect to let us know she's here. It's catchy enough and worth a listen. 3/5   * Work it man - this is a mid-tempo track about the sort of partner every woman should have. 2.5/5  * Motivation - this sexy ballad is one of the standout tracks on the album distinguished by Kelly's delivery and its vocal arrangement. This is one song you'll remember above all others. 5/5  * Lay it on me - this catchy track like its predecessor just oozes sex but it's one song you'll listen to again and again. 4/5  * Feeling me right now - initially I thought Kelly was having a lesbian moment but after a few listens, I realised the track is about self-love. Cleverly delivered concept and nice vocal delivery. 3/5  * Turn it up - this track's about coping with heartbreak. It's most certainly worth a listen. 2.5/5  * All of the night -another song oozing sex but more subtly. Here we get an idea of what Ms. Kelly's capable of vocally. I really could have done without Rico Love growling turn the lights on 4.5/5  * Keep it between us.- this is beautiful ballad about preserving a relationship. 4/5  * Commander -Loved this song. 4/5  * Down for whatever - this is a fabulous dance track. Very catchy. 4/5  * Heaven and Earth - a wonderful ballad written by Neyo on which Kelly sounds simply amazing. 5/5  * Each other - a beautiful mid-tempo with a wonderful arrangement and performance from Ms.Kelly. Gave it 3/5 because Rico Love's \\"turn the lights on\\" was beyond irritating.  * Motivation remix -Just a filler. Adds nothing to the album.2/5  * Commander remix featuring Nelly - this was an interesting take on the original which I liked as it has an identity distinct from the original. 3/5  Here I Am is an album you can listen to from start to finish consisting of more uptempo tracks than her previous efforts. Some more ballads where Kelly showcases her true vocal ability would have been nice as well as much less of Rico Love growling \\"turn the lights on\\" in a pseudo sexy manner would have been even better. Overall, I give it a rating of 3.5/5.

0545259088|4.0|In the last book in the Mercy Falls trilogy, stakes run higher than ever before. The first two books were full of action and emotion that seemed to never stop, and this one followed through as well. It starts out with Grace as a wolf, and Sam waiting for warmer weather which will cause her to shift. Cole St. Clair, plays a more prominent part in this book than the others, and is intent on finding a cure.<br /><br />But things aren't perfect in Mercy Falls, Isabel's father, a big shot lawyer, is determined to get rid of the wolves all together. Yes, he has been trying for quite some time but this time the lawmakers are on his side. And Isabel knows she has to stop it. Because it's not just Grace out there, there's Beck and all the other wolves that, if her father's plan follows through, will be gone.<br /><br />I love these books because they are full of problems and suspense and excitement. Although I was sad to see that Sam and Grace, my favorite characters, didn't play as prominent a part as before.  I liked that while I was reading it I was surprised and didn't see what came next. Although when I finally did get to the end I felt like some questions were left up in air, which is good, but could have still ended a little bit better. After all, this was the last book.<br /><br />Regardless, I felt that this book was very well written and a great addition to the series. I'll miss reading about... first the wolf, then the boy with yellow eyes.  (Read and reviewed by Kate, the Girl with Her Nose in a Book.)

B004IFYMWK|5.0|The reviews already posted describe this film well.  I throw my hat into the ring only to add to the high-end ratings.  It is rare to find a movie that is this thoroughly linked to a critical event and is also very well performed.  The result combines entertainment with education as the viewer is forced to confront some difficult realities and think about how each of us contributes, or fails to contribute, to a just society.  We cannot always sit back and let others do the heavy lifting when our own government is harming innocent people.
B004J4WL50|5.0|I don't know how you can read this book and not be inspired. I was excited to receive a review copy of Start Something That Matters from the publisher, because, well, what Mr. Mycoskie is doing fits in fantastically with my worldview. I hoped the book would be neither too dry, nor too preachy, and lucky me, all my hopes came true!<br /><br />The book is the story of TOMS, which is a shoe company that operates on a 1for1 business model: for every pair of shoes they sell, they give one to a child who is without. The book goes into great detail of how Mr. Mycoskie came up with the idea, how he implemented it, and the secrets of his success. There are also many inspiring stories from other companies who are doing similar things, and some who got the idea from TOMS and have started their own for-profit 1for1 companies.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that there was some really good info on how business people and consumers can make a difference, in both big and small ways. I was also glad to see that he didn't act like everyone can just run off and start their own company tomorrow, like many of similar books do. Instead, he encourages people to start small, and gives many examples of people who did just that.<br /><br />The writing was engaging, accessible and compulsively readable. Many pictures and little boxed-in stories (there has to be a name for that, right?) accompanied the text. Overall I was very impressed with the content and the writing style.<br /><br />Though I did give the book 5 stars, there were one big thing I had an issue with: labor practices. I didn't dock my rating because the issue was with the ideology, not with the writing of this book. However, I was uncomfortable with Mr. Mycoskie encouraging people to hire full-time, long-term unpaid interns. Yes, I get that many start-ups do this, and it can be a great opportunity for the interns. In fact, all the interns who began at TOMS inception are still with the company. But at one point he mentions a company hiring as many as 20 unpaid interns. If you have so much business that you need that many interns, then you need to be paying your employees.<br /><br />He also encouraged people to use the site 99designs. Basically, this is a site where people put up a request for a logo or other design, and then graphic designers get to work for free in the hopes that their design will be chosen. Sure, there are plenty of contests similar to this with various t-shirt companies and magazines. But if a company wants to work with a graphic designer to have a logo made, then they need to commission the work. As a freelancer, I am uncomfortable with this model and I wish he hadn't encouraged it.<br /><br />That aside, the book was excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make a difference, on either a personal or professional level, or someone who's simply interested in how this very different company began.s.

While he sometimes takes a few liberties with the Greek & Roman Myths to make a better story, I found that his grasp of the history was pretty accurate. His veiw on Mars vs. Aires for instance was entertaining to say the least (In the greek version he's a biker thug and in the Mars version a little more like Mr. Moto in the Karate Kid movies). The book held my interest as an adult so I would recommend it.

If you said yes please leave NOW.  This is not your album.  Seriously, people need to check their expectations.  This isn't a Metallica album.  Its not a Lou Reed album.  Its not claiming to be either.  Its a unique PROJECT and it needs to be appreciated for what it is, not attacked for failing to live up to something its not.
B002VHI8J0|2.0|This book was and is touted as a future classic...yep, like many classics it is ponderous, unenjoyable, has a difficult language style, and is over rated. The concept of the interlinking stories and the idea premise behind them was an interesting one but the writing was difficult to get into. Once you got into the rhythm of the writing in one story it changes completely in the next, it was like the author was letting the world know how clever he was rather than consider the reader. I read this one in stops and starts as I had to finish it for book club, but I am not sure I would have bothered if I didn't have to
B0025KVLTW|5.0|After when Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band was released, their music started to get weirder and weirder. That doesn't mean that the music got worse. Personally, I think their later work was the best. Except their worst song was on the White Album. I mean, Revolution 9? Ugh!!!!! But like I said, it didn't get worse. And this here album proves it.    This album has great examples of absolute masterpieces. For example, Paul's work, I mean vocals, were just extraordinary. John's work on I am the Walrus were unbelievable. I mean, sure there are some weird ones like Blue Jay Way and Flying. But Flying is an instrumental, so you can excuse that. Look, all I'm saying is that this album does have some of their weirdest music, but it is still extraordinary. So if you ask me, if you are going to buy any Beatles albums, I suggest that you buy this one. I guarantee that you will be satisfied!

I would reccomend this DVD to anyone, not just Prince fans cause it is about celebrating the love of music and fans.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|The issue with Tree of Life is not whether you like it or not....some will find it life-changing, others a bit slow and pretentious. In this sense, to rate the film as a stand alone object is to miss the point - one needs to take into account who we are becoming as a people in order to judge this film as either acceptable or not. I'd like to think that even if people suggest that it's \\"not for them\\" that they could concede to its visual and metaphysical power (and, if not for them, then for others). Perhaps the better question to ask is if 'Tree of Life' brings something good and fresh to the table with regards to film philosophy...I would say undoubtedly \\"yes\\". In this regard, I believe it may be one of the top 10 films of the past 25 years.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|If you want a pocket-sized sharpener, that you can use to clean up a knife edge in a matter of seconds, this is a good sharpener. If you're looking to give your favorite knife a razor's edge, you\\"re gonna have too look at something better.<br />  This would be great for camping: it takes up almost no room, and can clean up minor nicks in a blade with the carbide teeth, and polish it up with the ceramic teeth. The flip-out portion for serrated blades is very rough, and will remove quite a bit of material. It's also tapered.<br />  The carbide and ceramic teeth are replaceable.<br /><br />  All in all, I'm glad I bought it. It will come in handy when I'm camping. But, I also decided to buy a Smith's knife sharpening kit, to use \\"in the real world\\", so I can get a good sharp edge on my knives.<br /><br />  If there were a way to adjust the angle of the teeth, it might allow you to get a better edge. Or if they had set it at a better angle.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Well lets take you back to 2005 when Eminem is currently touring the \\"Anger Management 2005 Tour\\", Eminem is struggling with his addiction to Vicodin, admits he has a addiction to sleeping pills, and is put into a rehab facility for a time period of 3 years.  While still in rehab he releases his 1st compilation album along with a series of albums that followed such as:  \\"Curtain Call\\"(2005), Eminem: Presents The Re-Up (2006).  But enough talking lets get to the chase, it's 2008, and Eminem has finally sobered up and is now officially drug free. In 2009 Eminem released his first album in 5 years entitled \\"Relapse\\" which was better than his previous album \\"Encore\\", which had a-lot of critics raving. Later that year in 2009 Eminem releases another disc for Relapse entitled \\"Relapse: Refill to fill the fans over till Relapse 2 would drop which would of course be re-named \\"Recovery\\" released in 2010.  Now lets get to the actual album.  1. Cold Wind Blows 9/10  2. Talking To Myself Feat. Kobe 11/10 (Very impressive)  3. On Fire (This is a freestyle, not my favorite on the album though) 6/10  4.

B005EY2XFC|5.0|Hadn't seen this since The Crow first came out in the theaters in the early 1990s. I picked it up on blu-ray wondering if it was great as I'd remembered. It sure is! An incredible, pitch black action film starring the late great Brandon Lee gets a solid blu-ray treatment at a low price. If Brandon Lee had not been tragically killed during the making of the film, The Crow would have propelled him to stardom as great as his father's.
0307593312|3.0|On January 22, 1984, in what has become an iconic moment in advertising history, the first Apple Macintosh computer was introduced to the world. Striking a cinematic blow against an Orwellian Big Brother figure haranguing a grey and faceless army of brainwashed drones, an attractive and athletic young woman eludes pursuing stormtrooper guards and heroically hurls an iron hammer that shatters Big Brother's huge black and white telescreen, ending oppression, freeing everyone--changing the world.  The voiceover intones--\\"1984 will not be like 1984.\\"<br /><br />1984. You know--the dystopian novel by George Orwell written in 1948 that depicts a nightmare no-hope future where everything is rotten and nobody ever has a nice day.<br /><br />Rewind your cassette tape. On an average spring day in central Tokyo, April 1984, an impeccably attired, attractive young woman, Masumi Aomame, late for a very important appointment but marooned in a taxi on a hopelessly jammed elevated expressway, takes an extreme measure. At the suggestion of her slightly odd driver, she escapes the highway using a little-noticed rickety emergency exit to street level underneath a prominent Esso put-a-tiger-in-your-tank billboard.  Before departing the cab, the driver cautions that if she does this, \\"Things may look different to you than they did before. I've had that experience myself. But don't let appearances fool you. There is always only one reality.\\" And with that, while Leos Janacek's Sinfonietta booms ominously on the taxi's high-end FM radio, Aomame enters a world where there are two moons in the night sky and everything she knows is wrong--to her 1984 will not be like 1984, it will be 1Q84. Magic.<br /><br />With this bravura and memorable opening, Haruki Murakami's vast, ambitious but flawed novel of everything, 1Q84, leaves the flat earth world of conventional fiction and begins the long, sometimes thrilling and entertaining, slog to the far distant end of some nine hundred beautifully written and translated pages. Not unlike flying to Tokyo on the Concorde, taking the long way around with the airbrakes on.<br /><br />So, the title: 1Q84. The Japanese word for the number nine is kyu. The year 1984 is thus spoken sen kyu-haku hachi-juu shi-nen. The use of the English letter Q is a multilingual pun, signifying to the Japanese reader (and should to anybody else), \\"we ain't in Kansas anymore.\\"--Reality has changed, old rules don't necessarily apply. We see that a weird novella named Air Chrysalis is rewritten, conspiracies are hatched, passions explode, people die, lovers are lost, puzzles and questions posed. While 1Q84 is indeed a novel of everything, probing notions of reality, truth, death, religion, identity, time, connections, pop culture, anger, duality, mirrors and strange sex, (the novels of Thomas Pynchon or David Foster Wallace and the stories of Jorge Luis Borges come to mind), it is not an envelope-pushing, hard to follow postmodern pyrotechnical fizz-fest. At its heart, it is a love story, sometimes achingly romantic.<br /><br />Our two protagonists, Aomame (a tough, outwardly cold chick who happens to be a very capable assassin of abusive men--think a Japanese Lisbeth Salander) and Tengo Kawana (a blandly quiet math teacher, novelist and ghostwriter), are both outsiders, both lonely. They are disconnected from each other and much of the world and have been since a long ago innocent grade school encounter was indelibly etched on their souls. They must traverse nine months in a strange new world filled with weird characters and baffling events, where, as in 1984, good days don't happen. Stand-ins for Orwell's Big Brother, the so-called Little People are maybe real, maybe unreal, and bizarre obstacles and complications must be overcome. Whether they know it or not, Tengo and Aomame are in love, and, like lovers everywhere, they must connect. Will they find each other? That is the venerable V-8 engine of the novel--though it is in much need ofa slimmed-down tiger in its nine hundred-page tank.<br /><br />But how does one edit a Japanese National Treasure, an acknowledged master of world literature, a writer perhaps in line for a Nobel Prize? How? Slashing lines, cutting entire episodes--go from here to there, eliminate that back-story, do we really need to know that? Or how about the long passages of half-baked arcana of that sinister religious cult--you lost me there. Let's off-load some unnecessary baggage, fly higher.<br /><br />Murakami, though, is a wizard. Using a technique familiar to his loyal readers around the world, Murakami, developing his theme of duality and reflected identities, alternates the narrative's point of view chapter by chapter. He is convincingly inside Aomame's head, then Tengo's, and in Book 3 adds the dogged and froggish detective Ushikawa--only then does the novel finally achieve lift off. Murakami carefully braids the threads of the story, gradually tightening them like a Chinese finger trap, ultimately permitting the reader differing views of the same event, resulting in our seeing the action from a higher altitude, a crafty cinematic device. Throughout, each chapter's title is a fragment of a line in the narrative--a delightful motif that prompts an engaging bit of paging back and forth as the reader works to decipher Murakami's narrative trail of bread crumbs.<br /><br />With a painstaking Japanese, perhaps Apple-like, attention to detail, the book itself is beautifully designed and produced. Fine paper, a lovely binding and a translucent moon grey rice-paper dust jacket with haunting frontispiece images of the twin moons of the story add to the proposition of the presence of a new world. Page numbers alternate, printing backwards, sometimes left hand, sometimes right.  And the book's logo, 1Q84, is mirrored across facing margins, reflecting itself, helping to produce an effective and unique coherence to the novel as a complete package.<br /><br />And yet. The magic and promise of the opening chapter, the image of the elegant Aomame descending that fragile stairway into the heart of a gritty new Tokyo, is not sustained over the many miles in the long distance flight of this novel.  The slim and beautiful Concorde flew fast and high. But the fat and beautiful 1Q84 aspires to do more, to fly us to the moon--too bad it staggers under its own weight, never quite leaving the orbit of this flat earth.tank.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Before reading this book, my view of Steve Jobs was really just that he was someone who created great devices and led an interesting life. After reading the book, I've come to see that as a strikingly narrow view of the man. It turns out that he was an extremely complex individual - socially, mentally, and spiritually. Walter Isaacson does a great job painting a thorough portrait of Jobs despite this complexity. After reading the book, I feel like I truly understand Jobs and the world he lived in.<br /><br />Isaacson also skillfully positions himself so that he can provide commentary and evidence from multiple sides of each story. I think that is what truly makes this book so great. At multiple points in the book, a scenario will be presented, for instance: there is a time when Bill Gates comes to visit Jobs later in life as Jobs starts to really show signs of his cancer taking over. They both reminisce and graciously comment on each others philosophies on a closed vs open system of computer hardware and software. You then are presented with comments that reflect what they really were thinking, but didn't say - the faults that each thought about the other's comments. This happens several times in the book and really brings out an interesting story line... why did Jobs get so upset at a certain person? and then what did they think of the confrontation? These scenarios make for an interesting read and I had really tough times putting the book down.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me was a lack of a clear timeline though. Several instances in the book jump from point to point and I often found myself trying to figure out how the multiple aspects of his life fit together. You will read a large section solely devoted to his personal life, and then jump back ten years to start reading more about his professional life. I feel this could have been presented better even if the aspects of his life made for a better story and readability when separated. Obviously, it would have been ridiculous to stop in the middle of his intense battles in his professional life in order to start also detailing his relationships of the late 80's, but I finished the book with very little understanding of how everything actually melded together.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Jobs is portrayed as someone who is very much a perfectionist. If he finds even a minor flaw in something, it is completely horrible. On the other hand, if he likes something, it's the best thing in the world. Several times, a product is about to be launched, but then pulled back at the last minute because he thinks of a way to do it better. It's this quest for perfection and a desire to find the perfect melding of art and technology that seemed to have really driven Steve Jobs. Before reading this book, I probably would have ignorantly and incorrectly thought he was primarily into making money.<br /><br />That's another thing that really bothers me about this book though. Steve Jobs would have never released something based on profitability. He would insist on perfection over profit every time. It seems to me that this book was released somewhat unfinished for profits sake. When Steve Jobs died, the book seems to have been moved up to launch a week earlier in order to take advantage of his recent death. Another possibility would have been to delay the book, add chapters outlining his death, the mourning, the aftermath... to me, that would have made a better, more complete book. Instead, it was released with no mention of his death and no revisions.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />The more I think about that last sentiment, the more the last part of the book make sense to keep it this way though. It goes into how he wondered if life was like an on/off switch, where everything about you - your motivations, experience, intelligence, understanding - is all just shut off after you die. Maybe it's better that the book doesn't have an on/off switch and kind of leaves you hanging,because Steve Jobs didn't believe in apple's products having them either.having them either.

B0055DKSQ8|1.0|This highly rated novel by Jonathan Franzen, who was quite impressive on Bill Maher's Real Time, is highly overrated. The New York Times calls it a \\"masterpiece of American fiction.\\" For me, admittedly a less than avid reader, Mr. Franzen gives us an annoying mishmash of unappealing, under-developed characters going pretty much nowhere. All the post-911 Americana in the background seems only scantily related to their lives. The buzz from reading my first electronic read has definitely sputtered to a snow-screen hiss.<br /><br />Three chapters of feminine autobiography written by a man are a tough hurdle to cross in the first place, and by the time the fourth pops up, I am already bored with this woman. The other chapters seem to suffer point-of-view, timeline and coherency problems. Me thinks this book needed an editor unintimidated by Mr. Franzen's success. A healthy rewrite and another round of editing for this obviously talented scribe would seem to be in order.<br /><br />The main element that held some degree of interest for me at the start was the promise of some kind of Washington scandal, which turns out to be shallow, unconvincing and environmental. Is there anything less human or less dramatic. Avatar this is not, and in the one scene that seems to set up some kind of exciting clash, the main characters simply turn around and drive back down the road.  The most-developed male supposedly looks like Omar Ghadafy (or however you want to spell the late Libyan dictator's name), which leaves grave doubts about what was supposed to have made him so attractive.<br /><br />Since this was my first Kindle (on an iPad II) adventure, I was grateful for the ability to post snide notes in the text when sentences failed to deliver and to raise questions that weren't answered to my satisfaction. Sadly, most of my highlights are passages that didn't deliver. I also took full advantage of the ability to speed read with a flick of a finger through sections that were going to predictable places where I didn't want to go, particularly in the \\"autobiography,\\" which was almost not self-conscious enough and too cleverly written to be credible.<br /><br />So, it wasn't all bad, just mostly bad -- less social history than yet another unfunny sit-com with yet another dysfunctional American family. And I guess, maybe in partial defense of the critics who find such depth and such truth in this book, that's what we all are anyway. Maybe I should have read the reviews before instead of after reading the book, but they're certainly not making me like it any more.<br /><br />The best thing about reading this particular volume in the great-American-novel genre is that it saves me from any desire to read Mr. Franzen's earlier works on Kindle. Hopefully, I can move on to better reads.idn't want to go, particularly in the \\"autobiography,\\" which was almost not self-conscious enough and too cleverly written to be credible.

B005QPGHQU|5.0|The big question re: Evanescence was whether or not they could move forward & evolve beyond the gloom-grind-goth style and develop into something new & authentic without losing their signature sound.  I would say that the new album accomplishes this-- While the songs in their groundbreaking album were wonderful in finding beauty within melancholy and heartbreak, I always wondered how they could sustain this with any freshness.  The new songs are much more upbeat, Amy's vocals are flawless and the guitars, drums & bass propel it all forward with a purity of force & resonance.

The touchpad is also bigger than the ipad 2, which my parents have.  So this is not made for the ipad either.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I'm not a writer, I'm an artist.  Lately I've been reading about the use of social media and in that regard came across this book.  The reviews are interesting in their disparity of opinions, but I did notice that it's got a lot more positive than negative ones.  One review that outlined John's basic marketing plan really caught my eye and so I decided to get it and see if there was anything at all that could be useful for me.  There was.<br /><br />I'll be succinct, like John is in this book (which I really appreciate, getting right to the point).  Having him describe what he's done in the past was useful for me in understanding his credentials and that he knows well of what he speaks (it did not come across to me as egotistical at all).<br /><br />His description of what didn't work for him was valuable to me in that it may help me from wasting time pursuing similar avenues in my field of art.<br /><br />But the most valuable and applicable to me were his explicit details on how he uses social media and how he feels about and relates to his customers.  I've had a basic grasp of this, but with the information John has shared I can hone it and refine it and apply it.  So, John, this isn't just for writers or would-be writers or people who are friends and family of writers.  There's a third circle, with at least me in it.  I'm heading off to Twitter and my Facebook Page to start implementing stuff.  Thank you, John, and also thank you for the fabulous price.  It was worth every penny and then some.
0446573019|3.0|John Puller is an Army Ranger in a long line of Army stand-outs. He works for CID and is given the task of single-handedly finding the killer of a high ranking Army officer and his family. All of this takes place in a small, depressed town in coal mining West Virginia.  I love David Baldacci. I want to get that out there from the start. I love Lee Child as well and would happily keep Jack Reacher happy for the rest of his, and my, days. That's why it was so depressing when I realized John Puller and Jack Reacher were practically clones.  Mr. Baldacci caught my interest from the outset. It was when I got a couple of chapters in that I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading a Baldacci book, not a Child book. The similarities were, well, very disappointing. Once I made the connection, I found myself LOOKING for the parallels and, finding them, basing my enjoyment on the comparisons. As you can probably tell from my three stars, Puller came out lacking.   I read the book quickly, it was a relatively easy read (except for the detailed instructions on how to build a nuclear bomb)but there's nothing stellar about it. Perhaps Mr. Baldacci is planning on making Puller a returning character and that's why he left SO many questions unanswered, but it drives me crazy.  Give it a try. Especially if you've never read Lee Child's books.....

B004I8WD6E|5.0|Just received my AmazonBasics TPU case for my iPhone 4S.  I love this case.  Its crystal clear, nice and pliable, and fits the phone perfectly.  Combined with the included screen protector, I feel that my expensive gadget is well protected from any mishaps.  I previously had the phone in a leather flip up case made by Proporta, which was ok, but the phone sometimes wanted to slide out of it.  Plus it was annoying having to flip up the cover to use the phone.  This nice clear case allows me to show off my white iPhone's sleek, great looks, while giving it the protection it needs.  All of the holes for ports and switches line up perfectly, and the concentric rings on back draw your eye to the Apple logo.  The included screen protector is great as well.  I've never used one before, since I could never apply them correctly and/or they either weren't perfectly clear, or they made the screen feel different.  This one is the first protector that I've seen that is perfectly clear, preserving the Retina Display's great picture, all while being completely unnoticeable to your finger.  You seriously have to look to see that there is a protector on there.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase, and recommend this case/screen protector combination to anyone looking to keep their iPhone 4/4S in great shape.

B000KQGP2G|5.0|This album really lost me when i first listened to it.  I was saying this can't be...there's gotta be a mistake!But i gave it some time to grow in me and it payed off.  I love how people keep bashing this album along with their previous release(Be) or keep saying that this isn't even close to \\"BE\\". These people will never learn music as an art form of expression and they should stick to manowar (their latest releases). If you want progressive in a close minded way then stick to static x and dream theater(I'm not bashing them,I love them) this one is progressive music overall. And the nice thing is that by it's release it has created such a controversy that it is completely enjoyable,I'd say job well done.  For the part II of Perfect Element trilogy,I surely did not expect it to be this way but now after hundreds and hundreds of listening sessions I understand. The music here serves the concept.  Once again great vocal lines and compositions overall.  This album can be listened to as a casual album or as a deep concept album that need exploration and understanding from ourselves. Either way gives a great experiense.  To those who still bash it (the only reason I accept is that it doesn't suit your taste) you still don't get this album.this is not a weak release,it stands proudly with albums such as Remedy Lane and even BE.Give it a try to appreciate it and if the you don't like it then it's a personal taste,not because the album is bad or weak.
1423140591|5.0|Another good adventure story in the new series although I have to re-read the first book to find out what happened in the beginning. It is fun to see how Rick Riordan exploited the difference in the Greek and the Roman versions of the  myth and created another exciting-read.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|This one was a truly surprising album.  This one pushed the bar further for Mikael Akerfeldt and Opeth.  What amazes me is that they have not lost the death sound in all... You will still listen to riffs that,if played with heavier distortion would sound like classic opeth and yet you listen to something completely new and innovative.  Clearly no word can express this album.  Mikael said that he felt he was preparing for this album since he was 18 and I believe him.  This album is truly a heritage.  Jazz fusion,hard rock all in the opeth's progressive perspective.
0385534639|2.0|I am very sorry to say that I was quite disappointed. I was contantly waiting for something or someone to draw me in, but it never happened. I will not be looking forward to the sequel if there is to be one.
0345533054|5.0|Its such a great read and keeps you pulled into it and there's so many different things you are wondering while your reading and then the end is just a total shock! And then it shocks you again! I loved it.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|This was impossible to properly align and install - make a mess of the phone 4S even after reviewing installation videos and taking over an hour trying over and over again - what a waste. Only solution was aking off, throughing it away, cleaning my iPhone up, and search around for another screen protector that is actually workable. $25 down the tubes.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This is a timeless classic, great for a rainy or snowy day when you're stuck indoors and of a certain age.  The fabulous Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey before the nose job which was a big mistake.  I always feel better after this movie; I spent a few summers at places like that as a child, and took my own children when they were small. This movie is one of The Essentials.
0345529057|5.0|Loved this set and immediately went out and bought #5. Very well written with wonderful attention to detail. The weaving together of all of the character lines was masterful.
1416955070|3.0|I would have to describe this book as somewhere in between Twilight and Harry Potter..   In our world, we do not have the sight to see their world as they live amongst us, I guess you could say.   This book has Shadowhunters, werewolves, vampires, faeries, demons, these creepy but interesting soul/people/men? that are called the silent brothers.   They have cool gadgets and weapons and ruins and swirling tattoos that do just about anything..   Of course they have the bad guy, the story has a pretty cool twist to it. I really enjoyed all the characters and the storyline.   I already bought the next book, City of Ashes.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|This movie is great!  Great actors, great storytelling, great special effects, great everything!  Michael Fassbender is going to take America by storm. Looking forward to a sequel to this.  Hopefully, Wolverine will stay out of this one.  Don't get me wrong, Wolverine is my favorite X-Man, but he needs a break from these films.  His cameo was nice in the first one, but he can stay out of the rest.  Looking forward to Jean and Cyclops being introduced to the X-Men, and each other.  Maybe they'll redo the \\"Phoenix\\" story, and do it better this time, then just having Jean stand there.
1416972250|5.0|My favorite out of the three, the books just kept getting better. I basically knew what was going to happen and what I wanted to happen I just didn't know how it was going to happen.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|not to bad of a movie.  actors not top notch but the idea for the movie was unique. wouldn't watch again
1416972242|4.0|This book got more in depth with the characters and backgrounds. When I'm introduced into different worlds and sci-fi characters I want to know all the details, because my version and the authors version are completely different and I feel the author did a pretty good job explaining more in this book. Also, if I'm going to love a character I need to know background info. on them.   SPOILER ALERT***   I really liked Cassandra Clare's faeries, my version of fairies are Tinkerbell, beautiful, tiny and pixie dust. Her faeries are beautiful, yes, but they're evil in ways and tricky but they can only be honest.   I thought it was funny when the two kids in the cafe were argueing about who would win in a fight, Albus Dumbledore or Magnus Bane, their famous warlock. I love when authors bring up other books :)   I was upset when Simon was turned and I hope they cure him.   There is going to be some way that Jace and Clary are not brother and sister, there has to be!!!! I like how Valentine explains to us that the reason they have that bond is because they were unable to grow up together and have fight like siblings do, so that kind of explains it... but WHO did the inquister tell him he was when she saw his childhood scar???? And she was happy!!!! At first I thought he was her grandson, but his mother was still pregnant with him when she died. I'm thinking he really IS Micheal Waylands son and Valentine raised him?? Do we find out in the 3rd book or will there be a fourth???   It was fun to read and as soon as I finished I picked up the 3rd book and got right into it. :)
B00024I2Z4|4.0|My daughter liked this movie, as well as myself. Definitely a must for you Disney collection. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has there own little princess.
B000WS8SA4|5.0|This book teaches basic, natural principles, that if applied correctly, will significantly transform your life for the better. In short (spoiler alert) it teaches what the Natural Law of Attraction is, and how it can be applied to one's personal goals. For me it was a life transforming book, one which, although it did not explain absolutely everything, it pointed me in the right direction towards understanding of many things which were not clear to me. The Secret, along with many other books, teachers, mentors, personalities, and those around me, have shaped me into the person that I am today, and for that, I am ever so thankful.   There is an old proverb that says \\"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a life time.\\" This book is the equivalent of teaching one of the many ways there are to go about fishing. It is up to the reader to actually apply what it teaches, on a consistent basis in order to achieve consistent results. It tells you the method, but the tools and the books that will re-enforce and help one achieve are up to each individual reader to seek and find.    The Secret is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to natural laws, since the Law of Attraction is one of many that are in constant motion. If you truly want to change your life, for the better, and get started in achieving your dreams, in making them happen instead of just dreaming, then you should definitely begin with this book. Take notes of the references in The Secret, and continue your learning from there, one reference will point to another, and eventually, you will find your own way to achieving success.
B005XOPEOU|3.0|As a big Coldplay fan-and a huge proponent of their last record Viva La Vida, needless to say I looked forward to Mylo Xyloto;s release. Having heard some previewed live tracks from the bands Glastonbury show earlier this year, my appetite was even more ferocious for  the entire album. What arrived, unfortunately, was a strong group of songs buried in layer upon layer of production-removing Coldplay's strongest asset, the human element in each song.   If you're a Coldplay fan, one thing you appreciate is their earnestness-a quality that is all but lost when drum machines and a wash of swirling synths cover up the performances themselves. Songs like \\"Charlie Brown\\" and \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall\\" shine in spite of the production, where \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" and in particular \\"Paradise\\"are drowing to the point where you half expect Chris Martin's vocals to be auto-tuned. Too much, guys-too much.  Don't get me wrong-this isn't a bad album. But if you are someone wanting to introduce yourself to the heart of the band, I recommend you start with Parachutes, Rush Of blood To the Head, or Viva La Vida.
B0053B347M|5.0|The LED strip was easy to install and works well. The only downside is that it stays on all the time, even when the computer is off.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Love this. Replaced two apps on my phone, and a great assortment of tabs. You can auto-scroll a tab if you want, to make play-along easier.  Lots of different guitar tunings available. The price is a tad high, but still, I strongly recommend.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Best erotic screen in movie history! Great casting.  You will know the screen when you see it. :-)  James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhal are geniuses.
B001HN6922|5.0|A little more \\"potty humor\\" than I cared to watch and a little predictable, but I'm not the target audience.  The kids thought it was great.  Overall, I thought Pixar produced another great kids movie that was easy for me to watch with them on \\"family movie night\\".  Since it is geared towards kids, we rated it a 5 star.
B005FVA63A|5.0|Kinda like the ZooTV tour back in 92/93, this set makes sense - an over-the-top overload - however, way too much redundant material included that a vast majority of fans already have.  Nifty packaging design.  Limited Edition, individually numbered on the outside in gold-lettering (4 digits - no idea of a max number though).<br /><br />Most of this material can be found with the far less expensive versions out there, but having a copy of The Fly shades all to your own?  This is where the ZooTV fan would find this set worth it, in the end.  Buy it just for the sunglasses?  No, but taken with everything else presented, it then becomes essential.<br /><br />The 'Kindergarten' 'baby' version of AB is, in all honesty, a true standout in all of these multiple AB versions that include it.  An entirely new, unreleased embryonic AB that would have made a fantastic must-have 'bootleg' back in the 90's (vs. the 'Salome' outtakes, for example).  Brilliant, really.<br /><br />Achtung Baby itself does seem to be improved in sound quality.  Cleaner, crispier, more lower-end.  But fairly subtle.  It was already pretty good to begin with, but this now is the best version available.<br /><br />Very nice to see them gather most of their Achtung material into one place with the few unreleased tracks from the AB sessions (while all good, none really stand out enough).  Great prints included.  No lithographs.  Fun trinkets.  The book includes quite a few unreleased pictures that are worth seeing for that time period.<br /><br />Uber is only worth it for the legit, 'fanatic' Achtung Baby/ZooTV era people who've been looking forward to the 20th Anniversary re-release.  For this group, it's a no-brainer purchase (plus, these will probably sell out and eventually become very expensive on the collectors market if they stick to their limited-edition numbered release).
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Amazonbasics products are great in my experience and this case fits that description. The Amazon cases were so cheap I tried a couple, the silicone one in black and the leather one in addition to this. I use the others but prefer this transparent case. The clear material allows you to see the sides of the iPhone and the design of the phone itself is far more appealing than the black rubber of competing cases. The Amazonbasics silicone case is thin and a bit floppy, the leather one is very nice but does not cover the top 25% of the phone, meaning two of four corners are potentially at risk in a fall. This one is more aesthetically pleasing and gives very good protection. The material is tough but easy to hold and it offers visible protection at the corners and other potential points of impact. I accidentally dropped my phone onto a concrete sidewalk and it came through without a problem. This case is a remarkable value. The name brand ones have to be sold at very high profit margins given Amazon''s ability to provide high quality cases at a fraction of the cost.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Will not install on Velocity Cruz tablet T301.  Glad it was free.  Please label appropriately.  Am having this problem too often on the Amazon Market.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I see that this has received mixed reviews but i really enjoyed it. I would not recommend reading many reviews that give away to much about the ending because I think that was my favorite section. Its a little more costly than i am comfortable spending. Other than the cost I would recommend it, enjoyed thinking about the larger ideas behind it. Also the weird language didn't bother me either.
B005J29HD0|5.0|The first version I picked up was the vinyl as from the time I bought my first bootleg in 1994, also on vinyl, I'd always fantasized about being a teenager and buying this album on Capitol Records in 1966 and hearing these wild, weird and wonderful sounds wafting from my record player.  I've just finished experiencing the fantasy and in a couple of days, I'll be picking up the CD version to hear the rest of the session excerpts and, of course, get a frame for the beautiful looking poster.  I've always loved Smile artwork and I'll be more than proud to display it in my apartment - just as soon as I map out some space.  I've always found this album - I guess now I can really call it an album - to be one of the most lighthearted and charming albums ever (almost) made.  After I heard the 2004 version, having (for years) read about the struggles of making this music, I wondered what was so god-awful complicated.  It was as if to say, 7 years ago, \\"now - that wasn't so hard, was it!\\".    It sounds like a good 90 plus percent of the album had been finished by the time it was shelved and cancelled.  Two favorite instrumental tracks on the bootlegs, \\"Look\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Around\\", remain instrumental pieces, and thank God because they sound perfect in that state - there was no need for lyrics.  As for the rest of the album, I think Brian Wilson and company did a masterful job in finally putting this together.  Bootleg obsessives who may have found some flaws in the 2004 version will eat this up and never want to stop playing it.  Right now, as I write this, I'm playing side 3 of the vinyl pressing for the second time, forgetting I have all day tomorrow to hear this as much as I desire.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I am very pleased with this release. They really put the time into the remaster process and it sounds better than ever. Someone really breathed life into this classic. I have listened to this several times already and the sound really is phenomenal. I played the vinyl first and was amazed how silent it is from the needle drop leading in as well as in between the songs. Afterwards I downloaded the cd and was just as pleased with the mastering of it too. The book is nicely done with lots of information (Ian Anderson was only 23 when Aqualung was recorded!) and interviews with everyone involved with the making of this ground breaking record. It isn't cheap but I don't mind when the quality such as this is there.
159562015X|5.0|[[ASIN:159562015X StrengthsFinder 2.0]]This is without doubt the most useful book I've read in years. Not only does this book show you your natural strengths, it also shows you how those strengths manifest themselves in your everyday life. It also shows you how to capitalize on your strengths. Stop spinning your wheels exhausting your power worrying about weakness and focus positive energy on building up your natural talents.
B004WZLMTC|5.0|what a great sale!  the product arrived on time, was exactly as described, and NO HASSLE!! thank you great experience!  I will be shopping you again.
B005F96URI|5.0|Don't worry about the plot- it's the same plot of most of the Westerns, space operas, and other action films ever made. The narrator breaks that 4th wall for you immediately, so you can focus on the stagecraft.  And it's glorious- the origami meets art deco sets that shift and fold, the references to old video games, the acrobatic fight scenes...and so much more.  It calls for multiple viewings to process even half of it. Next time I watch it I'll be trying to concentrate on what's going on in the fight scenes around the combatants, and then I'll watch again to focus on the anime-like aspects.  This movie is going straight to cult status.  My only disappointment was Josh Hartnett's acting.  There was room in the role for an Eastwood-like ambivalence, but Hartnett's drifter doesn't have that depth.
B004W4N55C|4.0|I don't give five stars for apps because I feel there is always room for improvement. that being said this is a very useful app. lots of great built in features that work. thanks for the free app amazon. galaxy tab
B00004R99J|4.0|I am not a Disney fan, but when my daughter was younger she wanted to see various Disney films and while I disliked a lot of them, this is one I really enjoyed.   Of course, it isn't factual, the relations between Pocohontas and John Smith weren't as they are portrayed here, but it makes for a lovely story for kids and John Smith is a lovely hero, gung ho, funny and tender. Pocohontas is brave and independent, and for once the Disney empire's princess obsession is suited, as she was indeed a princess - or anyway, the daughter of the chief - in reality.  Serious issues about imperialism and environmental abuse are actually touched on, and the songs are generally good. Of course, there is the obligatory one dimensional villain (and his villainous pet) but this isn't used to simplify the social issues, for once.  I loved the sparkly magic effects when John Smith and Pochontas fall in love.  Always snivelled at the ending, oh dear.  Recommended.

B004SRNH10|5.0|If you don't like apps that don't work on your phone, don't download them. It says in the description that it won't work on the optimus.   Buy a real phone before you start one starring a great app. Kind of a battery hog, and at 24MBs is a large, but it does everything it promises.
B000Y11BAS|4.0|After we watched Frida, we looked up her biography, and found it to be historically accurate, within the confines of moviedom.  We visited Rockerfeller Center and saw the murals that had been originally painted by Diago, but were torn down.  The art deco is amazing.  We also enjoyed Evita, felt Madonna was good, but nothing compares to the play, of course. Can't say we have rewatched either movie, but would certainly recommend others viewing either one (perhaps borrowing it from the library or a friend).
B004W4N55C|5.0|Tremendously convenient and fun app for guitar players. I hope the developer makes some money with this one. QWERTY, QWERTY.
0060775858|5.0|Goodnight Moon has been a classic for years.  My children loved it, and I have been giving the book as a gift for years.  I had the pleasure of giving Goodnight Moon to my grandchild two years ago.  Actually, reading the book softly not only puts the child to sleep, it also completely relaxes the reader - not a bad thing either!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Street Law has its own rules; the attorneys \\"chase ambulances,\\" process no-fault divorces and literally run after cases no higher-class law firm would ever consider.  Street Law litigators are often sole practitioners; Grisham fashioned a two-guy office and then added a Harvard grad making it three semi-desperate counselors.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book on many levels.  I work in Chicago for Litigators, not the low-level \\"boutique\\" firm of Finley and Figg but a mid-sized prominent defense firm which gave me an advantage in terms of  legalese and the procedures.  I could not identify with Oscar Finn, the aging attorney, who felt he wasted the last 30 years with this crummy practice or Wally Figg, a drunk who is chasing the big pot of gold and will pull almost anything to sign up a client. However, I have met many David Zinc's, the burnt-out bright attorney who knows he cannot stand one more 100 hour week of entering billable hours for his cold-hearted large firm.<br /><br />Grisham recaptured the heroes of his earlier books in David Zinc.  We first meet David when he is enduring a full-fledged panic attack, as he is about to begin another day at the Rogan Rothberg 600 attorney firm.  After losing all control, David spends the rest of his soul-searching day in a neighborhood bar and later he drunkenly washes up at the doorstep of Finn & Figg.  David teams up with these low-level guys and begins to learn their ropes and seizes the moment.  He is a good man with a beautiful, smart wife, Helen. He does not cut corners and uses his own money to help and investigate a horrific injury to a Burmese boy.  In this case, Grisham aims his anger at American toy companies who have bought Chinese toy manufacturers that apparently manufacture lead poisoning rather than safe toys.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, Grisham was able to neatly include the mistreatment of illegal immigrants, the hypocrisy of the drug companies (Varrick Drugs is the chief antagonist), the frauds who will try anything to cheat someone out of money, product liability law and the real victims.  The main culprit is mass tort litigation where the victims remain victims while the plaintiff and defense lawyers reap the millions. Grisham slows David's progress but the reader knows that this Harvard grad is really smart and when he can understand the particular law, Federal court and how to litigate, we know he will be a star.  Through it all, David is a good friend and a reputable attorney (despite Wally's influence).  One of my favorite scenes takes place when David explains his new career to his father, a judge in Minnesota.  Expecting the judge to be of no use or patience, his response is not volatile.  Later, we learn his father taught David the moralities of the court decisions.<br /><br />Grisham has crafted an entertaining book, once again.  Some parts were totally unbelievable and he gave the reader almost every character imaginable: the slovenly ex-wife looking to score big in a lawsuit, the beautiful, sexy defense attorney (Nadine) for the drug company, sarcastic but loyal secretary (Rochelle) to Oscar and Wally, the bartender who has heard it all (Abner's), and of course, the insurance companies who will continue to profit win or lose. The reader prevails in this clever tale; it's a fun page-turner that really does not insult one's intelligence.  Setting the story in Chicago, of course, adds to the lack of civility and no holes barred zingers. However, he had several errors regarding Chicago areas and neighborhoods.  These would be quite obvious to a Chicagoan.  He needed a native Chicago editor!  4.5 starsy anything to cheat someone out of money, product liability law and the real victims.

014241493X|4.0|I found this book very entertaining, well written and humorous.  It really emphasizes how weird teenage boys are and the power they allow teenage girls to have over them.  I love the realistic spin taken, as the main character begins to see through the hormone-induced rose-colored glasses he figuratively wears and notices the real girl he has placed on the pedestal, that doesn't want to be there in the first place.  A co-worker of mine borrowed it from me and her junior high-school age son (who does not usually read) was looking over her shoulder and found the page funny, so therefore decided to read it himself.  In the end, he really enjoyed it and found the awkward and goofy main character relatable.

0425238091|5.0|Please pardon such a brief review, just adding emphasis to what some of the other 5-star reviewers have contributed.  The best summation I have heard of internship was told to me by one of my chief residents while I was a scrub/peon/intern:  \\"When you are an intern, LIFE IS HELL.\\"  Tip of my hat to Dr. Shem.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|This movie was just as it appears in the movies and stores. It came quick and I have no complaints about it.
1594484805|4.0|It's absolutely true that in fields where you need long stretches of hours in order to produce something creative, it doesn't make sense to try to shoehorn employees into 9 to 5 jobs.  It also makes sense, if you have creative employees who are responsible, to let them set their hours.  It makes sense to let those people have some time off to come up with additional creative ideas that the company may not have thought of.  Finally, it makes sense to let them not work on teams with people they don't like.  If you're saying \\"duh\\" to all of these propositions, then you don't need to read most of this book.  The problem comes with the author's attempt to apply all of these \\"lessons\\" to every other job in the world.  There's a reason why virtually all of his examples are software companies:  these \\"lessons\\" just don't work in most offices.  First, many people aren't responsible and you can't just fire everyone who isn't.  In large organizations it's hard enough to keep track of who's there 9 to 5, let alone who might be there 1 am to 9 am.  That said, the first part of this book, on how we have ignored intrinsic motivation and have let ourselves be led by the nose by economists who have maintained that the sole incentive we respond to is money, is a brilliant summary of the field and well worth reading.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I have a sudden crush for Linkin Park. Don't know why. I love Chester's cover of \\"Rolling in the deep\\" in Germany, and their performance at Red Square.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Haunting, riveting, deeply meaningful, visually gorgeous. The music, the cinematography, the acting (if you can call it that -- it's more like experiencing on camera). I ADORE this film. I must have it for my own to watch again and again. A feast for the senses. And the soul. Beauty.
B001LNOOG6|5.0|1) Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.    2) Genre: Mystery    3) Synopsis: Danny Cartwright is sent to prison for something, he didn't do.  Prison gives him a lot of time to plan how to get revenge on those who put him in there.    4) Feelings: If asked I always say that Jeffrey Archer is my favorite author but lately I haven't been as confident in saying that.  No longer.  This book is excellent for every person out there.  It is a modern day Count of Monte Cristo.  I know it is probably sacrilege for saying so but it is a better read then the Dumas classic.      5) Final recommendation:  This is a great book.  I recommend if you know how to read to pick this book up now.  You will thank me later.    Ryan James Burt   Husband, Father, and Writer  [...]

B005J4TLN4|5.0|Joe Cornish's ATTACK THE BLOCK is a great alien invasion film that isn't really about aliens at all.  Sure, it's got aliens.  But it's about the kids - it's about anger and rage and disappointment and what it feels like to grow up disenfranchised and disrespected and lost and hopeless.  Fifteen-year-old Moses is bitter and looks much older than he really is.  He lives alone with his ne'er-do-well uncle in a ghetto neighborhood in London.  He and his hoodie friends roam the streets attacking innocent passersby, talking trash, and hiding from the cops.  We don't like Moses or his friends - they reminded me of Alex and his \\"droogs\\" in Kubric's \\"Clockwork Orange.\\"  But as the film progresses we come to suspect that Moses is a product of the world in which he lives.  \\"Actions have consequences,\\" Joe Cornish tells us in this film.  Moses's decision to attack a young woman named Sam and his decision to track and kill a strange creature that slashes his face have consequences - and those consequences are horrible.  But at the same time, Moses himself is seen as the consequence of so many other people's actions - his uncle who is \\"here and there\\" but mostly missing; the police who seem clueless and incompetent; the adults who should be role models but who are selling drugs or shooting up the place.  We don't like Moses, but we come to understand him.  And actor John Boyega is amazing playing this young man.  He's anger personified, but there's so much more there under the surface.  Boyega's eyes alone communicate a world of emotion and experience.<br /><br />All that said, I must admit that the aliens themselves are a bit disappointing.  We see very little of the first alien until it's dead, and even then we never get a good look at it (I didn't mind that so much - in fact Cornish might have been wise to follow this same plan for the rest of the film as well).  The second wave of aliens, however, presents more of a problem for me.  The aliens honestly look like the grass creature things from Shyamalan's \\"Lady in the Water\\" (\\"Scrunts\\" - sort of big shaggy bear-like creatures with lots of teeth).  This is not a good thing.  I know this is a low-budget film, so special effects will be limited, but these creatures just don't say \\"aliens\\" to me.  They were scary and strange, but I couldn't quite see them as traveling through space.<br /><br />But since I really don't think this movie is about the aliens, I can't complain too much about how they actually look (and maybe Cornish's point is that \\"aliens\\" come in many forms and attack from many directions).  ATTACK THE BLOCK is an extremely exciting movie about the struggle to remain human in the face of attacks from all sides (and it's not an easy struggle).  By the time we get to the film's climax, Moses is no longer the angry fifteen-year-old hoodlum we see in that opening scene. He's changed, and so have we as viewers.<br /><br />ATTACK THE BLOCK is surprising on many levels.  It's worth watching.  It's worth buying.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|What does it take to make a person think differently? Brokeback Mountain is everything you would expect it to be and honestly much more. It is a meditative, thoughtful, well paced & shot, romance. There is a slight chance you may have never watched a love story of this nature before. The two main characters are Ennis Del Mar played by Heath Ledger and Jack Twist played by Jake Gyllenhaal. While these two are on assignment herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming they discover a similar interest: each other. Brokeback Mountain is a real testament to the fact love can definitely be found in the very unlikeliest of places and between the unlikeliest of people. Love in the traditional sense is not always what we think it is. Overall Brokeback Mountain is a very daring and stereotype destroying outing for all parties involved. Some people may not be interested and others may not be ready. Whether it's your thing or not Brokeback Mountain is a meaningful and enduring film.

B00457WZEI|5.0|This has been an interesting day in that I saw the preview for the film, 'War Horse', and being so moved by that, I had to read the book. I downloaded it to my iPad and proceeded to read it in one sitting, taking time out only to eat dinner. I will not go into a lengthy review, as there are plenty of good reviews of that type already available. I will say that this book has moved me in ways that quite possibly no other book has managed previously. 'War Horse' achieves four things for me, and achieves them in a most brilliant fashion: 1) It is extremely well-written (there is something about the style that reminds me of my favourite author, Hermann Hesse), contains outstanding character development, and seamlessly incorporates the other three achievements to which I refer; 2) It speaks of the futility and madness of war, several times bringing to mind scenes from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1930); 3) It deals with horses, and while containing some elements that were difficult to read due to my all too visual mind, it is realistic yet hopeful and inspiring; 4) It is set during an historical event and is believable in its settings. I experienced every emotion while reading this, and became attached to its characters, as though they were old friends. There's not much more you can ask for from a book than that. I have a distinct feeling that this was only the first time I will have read 'War Horse', as I suspect I will revisit Joey, Albert, Topthorn and the others many more times.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|It starts off with Reed loosely strumming a few chords and then uttering some totally pretentious lines about cutting his legs and tits off, Boris Karloff etc. That is at least tolerable. Then Metallica literally crash in with heavy power chords and James Hetfield singing \\"Small town girl\\" over and over. Still tolerable. Then Reed begins to \\"sing\\" about \\"Brandenburg Gate\\". Nothing can convince me that this doesn't sound terrible. It goes on from there as Reed continues to \\"sing\\" for almost the entirety of the rest of the album. There's less spoken word than has been already reported.    I've listened to this entire album several times and almost even tricked myself into thinking it really might just be good. Great even. Only to realise that, no, it really is awful. Maybe even deliberately.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|BALLS OUT: Steel Panther's follow up to 09's Feel The Steel keeps the swagger intact and the guitars shredding. Oh, and it's great.  This time around on Balls Out, the lyrics are even more hilarious, and while Feel The Steel had a couple songs that started out suspiciously like other songs from the 80's (intentional and funny), those songs got old to me compared to the rest of that album. I found myself rocking out to tracks such as \\"Eyes of a Panther\\" and \\"Asian Hooker\\" where Satchel came up with killer riffs (as opposed to \\"Fat Girl\\" and \\"Party All Day\\" which borrowed intros from whitesnake and bon jovi). On this album they are all Steel Panther and the guitar work is phenomenal. Seriously, it steals the show. I'm a guitar aficionado and on this album Satchel absolutely kills it. For instance \\"Critter\\" is one of the best tracks, and the solo is my favorite on the album. The chorus is great and the lyrics are really funny, but the guitar work really shines. Same goes for \\"That's What Girls Are For,\\" which has a great lick that hooks you throughout. \\"If You Really, Really Love Me\\" is another great one, and I love it when the guys bust out the acoustic and get unplugged for a bit.    I can't forget to mention the excellent vocal range that Michael puts on display here as well. Lexxi and Styx stepped it up a notch here too, and the drums are great, but like I said, Satchel's guitar is the one that steals the show on this album. After the Yngwie Malmsteen tribute/homage at the end of \\"Asian Hooker\\" (you have to be into guitar to really get it) on the last album, I knew the man was incredible, and this album further proves it.  Oh and \\"Super Sonic Sex Machine\\" is great because the verses have Michael sounding like he's Bruce Dickinson from early Iron Maiden at times. Great stuff.  If I have a complaint, it's that there aren't any songs that have \\"serious\\" lyrics.   \\"HUH?? THIS IS STEEL PANTHER! What kind of complaint is THAT!??\\" you're probably asking. Well, On Feel TheSteel, \\"Hell's On Fire\\" was actually mostly serious lyrically. \\"...I wanna party with Bon Scott- Randy Rhoads, John Bonham too, it's a heavy metal party and we're waiting for youuuu.\\"  And that's maybe my favorite song off of it. \\"Eyes of a Panther\\" you could play for somebody and they really wouldn't hear anything about nailing hookers/groupies or shooting up after a show, but it was still FULLY Steel Panther and FULLY rocking. There aren't any songs like that on this album and that's a real shame. They should have had at least a couple - the music is too good not too.   Besides that, there are a couple tracks that haven't done much for me, like \\"Weenie Ride.\\" \\"In The Future\\" is funny the first time but gets annoying when you're listening to the album anytime after (because it's just Dane Cook in a voice filter intro'ing the first track).  But, like i've said multiple times, Satchel's guitar work is killer and his solos happen to save a couple of other weaker tracks.  That's impressive.  Overall it's a great album, and with the absolutely premier musicianship of the guys and hilarious lyrics.  It's a very successful sophomore album.
B00006JMQG|5.0|Is it possible to go crazy at the crazy house? How about when every else around you is crazy, does that make you go crazy? The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a film in six acts written by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz. It is about a creepy old man named Dr. Caligari that comes to town with a traveling carnival. Dr. Caligari runs a side show attraction that features a somnambulist named Caesar. A somnambulist is a sleepwalker. Supposedly Caesar has been asleep for 23 years and only wakes up for the show. When Caesar awakes for the show he can answer anyone's question about anything. The scene gets real sketchy when Caesar predicts a murder a few hours before it happens. This prediction spawns a murder mystery that leads directly to the madhouse. This is a classic film that literary plunges into the depths of madness.  All the sets are creative and give the film a surrealist nightmare quality. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was created in 1920. The basic approach, creepy set pieces, and overall bizarre tone make this one a horror classic that stands the test of time. Look inside the cabinet and see that a little thought and creativity can go a very long way.
0525423656|3.0|I have been waiting for this book to come out for months now, this was a waste of my money. I should have waited to borrow it from the library. I did enjoy reading from Ky's point of view. The book dragged - it took so long for them to meet up. Then just like that she is back in the Society and there's no mention of Xander. I am not looking forward to the third installment at all.
0316098515|3.0|This book in terms of inspiration for ideas and technique is amazing.  In addition, many of the recipes in the book are very approachable as long as you are comfortable as a cook.  Meaning you do not need step by step instructions to do everything little thing).<br /><br />The biggest flaw in the book is the measurement system.  I simply cannot understand how a book written at this level of sophistication with such amazing ideas can have volume measurement and only volume measurements.  Even for pastry/desert recipes there are only volume measurements.  Recipes for salted caramel ice cream have measurements like \\"1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar\\"... really?  \\"1/2 cup glucose\\"... really? \\"2 1/2 cups buffalo mozzarella\\"(for an ice cream recipe so it needs to be accurate)... REALLY?<br /><br />I thought maybe they had an overall conversion chart that was specific to their cookbook for basic items like milk,cream, glucose, sugar and flour.  Nope.  Even flour is listed in cups-making recipes more time consuming and inaccurate.  A few recipes that use hydrocolloids even list teaspoons along side of grams-which is crazy because using a drop more xanthan gum or agar agar can drastically affect outcome.<br /><br />It would be great if the authors could attach a chart that listed the weights according to the ingredients used to test the recipes.<br /><br />e.g.-1 cup heavy cream=250 grams in our cookbook.&lt;- something like that would have been awesome-but it is no where to be found.<br /><br />If the momofuku milk-bar cookbook can put the recipes in weights than Eleven Madison Park should be able to do the same.  It is just inexcusable.<br /><br />The book is probably still worth buying-but it could be so much better.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|This book was really good as the first one. Had me crying on some parts of the book. The love that Sam and Grace have for each other is amamzing. Was sad how they had to be apart because of Grace's parents. Cole and Isabel are perfect for each other in their own crazy way. The end I knew it was going to happen, but its was so sad becasue I honestly thought at one point that she was going to die, then what Cole said would cure it, it left me know that what i knew what was going happen was going to happen. OMG cant wait to read the next one.

B000O77SRC|5.0|I don't think I've seen Die Hard since the 1980's.  It's a classic action film but what struck me was the technology advances. The limo driver puts in a cassette. The state of the art building, which I remember as being very cutting edge at the time, is routine technology now. It's a total blast from the past!
B004PHE9F6|5.0|I saw this when it came out and remembered scenes from with complete clarity, somuchso that I would think of it often as I grew up.  These were the perceptions of a kid - of crashes, of infidelities in troubled marriages, of unscrupulous bosses, of the rise of Japanese industrialists, of untimely death - peering into adult life.  In a way, I was scared that I wouldn't like it today, but I wanted to watch it with my son as my dad did with me.  Happily, it was almost completely satisfying as an adult.<br /><br />I think the most important characters in the film are, in a way, the race cars of the mid60s.  You get wonderful details about how they function, how they are designed, what their limits are, etc.  Of course, the men who create them are present, but they are mainly seen as businessmen of extraordinarily aggressive will to win at any cost, even the lives of their drivers.  Then, there are the drivers, who are the true lifeblood of the story, and their women.  My favorite is Yves Montand, a man of great talent and wisdom in a stalled marriage and burning out as a human being.  His team mate is an insensitive egoist from Sicily, an up-and-comer, who seduces a stupid groupie, the astonishingly beautiful Francoise Hardy in her prime.  Garner is excellent as a striver entering middle age, perhaps blowing his last chance.  He is seduced by the estranged wife of his old partner, who blames him for the terrible accident that maims him for life.  Toshiro Mifune is outstanding as a Japanese industrialist who wants to overcome the unchampion-like psychology of his Japanese drivers, employing subtle manipulation to do so.  Jessica (Play Misty4me) Walter, the estranged wife, delivered a performance so superior to Saint's that I was stunned.  Hardy made a great bombshell bimbo, to mirror the shallowness of her rock star boyfriend.  Brian Bedford, the wounded and implacably ambitious driver also develops a great character, complete with a pushy aristocratic mother that wants him to return and win, even if it costs him his life.<br /><br />The plot follows these characters and their career concerns through the grand prix circuit for world championship.  It is so exciting that it made me a racing fan for many years, and intertwines well with the lives and conflicts of the drivers at a time when the sport was raw and largely undiscovered and the cars far more artisanal than today's high tech masterpieces that are converging on a single design.  There is no other film that portrays this kind of danger and excitement in such vivid images, complete with the inner dialogues of the drivers as they explain what they are facing.  It is absolutely masterful.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the film isn't perfect.  I was surprised at how wooden Eva Marie Saint's performance was, really a walkthrough role of a character that she didn't bother to develop.  Her dialogue with Montand is stilted and formulaic.  Some of the effects are clearly dated, with flying dummies and models, though it is rare to notice them.<br /><br />The bluray print is really worth it, though I had my worries after some of the lousy prints I've seen of older films.  They did a first rate transfer of this, evidently superior to dvd versions.  Finally, the extras documentaries are interesting, if a bit much.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.urn and win, even if it costs him his life.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Ok..........where to begin. This movie sucked. I'm sorry. Sometimes movies just suck. I heard Warner Bros spent Avatar money on this movie, marketing it as the big action adventure. Woah. Firstly, the Green Lantern is not even in the second tier of super heroes. He is so far down the chain among notables such as batman, spiderman and superman. I doubt most people even knew who this was. I knew who it was, but I never wanted to be green lantern for halloween. However, the trailers for it looked interesting enough and there was nothing out at the time. I saw it in theaters. I don't know what you get in the blu-ray version. It may not be worth it unless there is a free copy of spiderman 2 in there.   Hal Jordan is cocky test pilot. For some reason, the lanterns choose him to be their next guardian. Apparently, the universe is full of green lanterns and they pick their members very carefully, but hall doesn't understand why they would pick him over everyone else. The usual super hero cliches begin. He gets powers. Learns them. Makes wise guy comments while doing so. Fights inner demons. Learn the \\"real\\" reason why he has been given these abilities. Fights a lame villain with a huge head. Fight another villain who is an escaped space monster. Fight said villain in large metropolitan area. Rescue a girl.   What should be cool about this movie is that the Green Lantern can create stuff with his mind. A giant fist? Yes. Machine gun? Yes. Giant ramp resembling hot wheels? Yes....? This is where the movie really gets cheesy. In one scene, a helicopter, after launching from a helipad, quickly spins out of control endangering the people below. There is a party going on down below and no party is complete without helicopter launch pads. I dont know. Maybe I'm just a high roller. What does the Green Lantern do? He clips the wings which causes the helicopter to pummel to the ground. UH OH! Its going too fast and now its sliding on the ground? What does the Green Lantern do now? Hemakes a ramp out of thin air for the sliding machine to go onto. Yes....a ramp. In the effort to make this movie cool, no solution is ever practical or ground in common sense for the green lantern. Extravagance is on Hal's mind. Any number of things springs to mind here. What if I had these powers? I'm sure you thought you could either make giant arms and punch the thing away, build a wall to stop it, or blow it up with a canon (something he does use later in the movie). But none of this happens. The result is a weird mix of awkward action sequences that are not cool at all and look downright silly at BEST.   Don't bother buying this seriously. Why spend 30 dollars on this????? Buy anything else instead.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|It is so refreshing to see a young performer that is so obviously All-American boy next door.  The songs on this CD are age appropriate for Scotty and in my opinion for young people listening to it also. I hope young people will follow Scotty's career and use HIM as an example. With his strong family ties and open attitude on his Christian values as an example there may be hope for young people who follow his example.

0385534639|3.0|Morgenstern's Night Circus is a wild tale of two sorcerous apprentices pitched into a duel for reasons unrevealed, their battleground a magical circus the likes never seen before.<br /><br />The story should have been epic, suggestions of age-old struggle, mythical battles, and emotional torment lurked throughout the scenes in this book.<br /><br />However in my opinion the effort simply wasn't there - the main protaganints were likeable enough, none of the other characters had enough depth to really attach to and despite Morgenstern's best interlude efforts I never really felt like The Circus, (or any other scene) for that matter was developed enough to really get a experience from what was going on, and given that the book is named for the Circus this gap rankled me as a reader.<br /><br />The end result is a loosely jumbled collection of magical ideas - cool ideas to be fair, nonetheless the Night Cirus seems like something that would suit a graphic novel or movie better, as the prose simple didn't convey as much 'magic' as I think was intended.

B005G4TJI4|2.0|I think this one is worse than the second one, although I am not sure. I don't really even remember the intricacies of the plot. Something about a space gate being setup by the decepticons, sending evil aliens to earth through the portal. This was the master plan this time. Yeah, I'm pretty sure thats it and its in Chicago to. Also, Meagan fox is gone. Rosie Huntington-Whitley is in. Who? Yeah, I checked. She is a Victory Secret model. Never had done any acting before ever. Surprisingly, she was not even that bad and far from the worst thing about this movie.   Ok, plot you ask? Well, Shia Labeauf is jobless living with his new girlfiend, Rosie Huntinton-whit......(im not writing that every time). His decepticon fighting days are in the past. Bumblebee does not even live with him anymore, although he would not be able to fit in their ultra deluxe downtown apartment. Its a good thing Rosie has that sweet job for a really rich guy who sells cars. Otherwise, they would be out on the street, but sam feels lost. He can't find a job and when he does, its not what he wants. \\"I just wanna do something where I'm appreciated\\", says sam. I just wanna be somebody! \\"You have to pay your dues\\", says victoria secret model. Fortunately, the hum drum life of being regular is broken. Sam is needed once again to fight the decepticons. A new control freak type lady has taken over control of the autobot operation. She dosn't respect Sam and doesn't want his help. Of course, its irrelevant. We know he's back in the game. It's a new story this time. Probably better thought out than the last one, but its ultimately the same thing. Gotta keep those decepticons from doing bad stuff. The story is made to be much more epic and the last part of the movie is generally exciting albeit makes no sense. The Decepticons are trying to setup their portal in Chicago I think it was. Its a warzone in there. Sam goes into it with nothing. He flies on machines. Gets knocked around. Rosie is there to. So arethe army dudes from the last two. Theres some excitement in sky scrapers with impossible falls and explosions. They end up back on the ground somehow from being 90 stories in the air.   I found this one to be more boring than the last one which was quite unexciting. The first one felt like a real adventure. This one does not capture any of that magic.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|This recording is not \\"pop metal\\" or an \\" I am Satanic\\" (no really) collection of fast chords power ballads with predictable and dull hard metal sentiments. Instead, Metallica and Lou Reed have delivered a work that, like a Francis Bacon painting, has strong and bold rhythms, chaos and abrasive beauty.  Turn this CD up as LOUD as you can and enjoy the fact that this is where Metal breaks free of the \\"how many time have we heard this\\" mold.  Also, if you like this work or are even the slightest bit intrigued by it, check out Jim Carroll's neglected masterpiece, \\"Pools of Mercury.\\"  It's all there.  I think you will enjoy it.
0786838655|5.0|Alright, so I'm kind of working backwards here.  I've already reviewed a few of the Percy Jackson books, but I always skipped over reviewing the first.  I'm not exactly sure why.  However, I came across the book today and I couldn't resist.   As corny as I may sound, I think the Percy Jackson series started a movement.  What I mean by this is, this books really made kids start reading.  The main character is praised for his faults and weaknesses-things he works through make him strong.  Any kid who has similar problems is going to relate.  And then to make him a hero?  A kid's hooked.    Percy Jackson is an average kid.  Except not really.  He has dyslexia, ADHD, bad grades and he's been kicked out of almost every school he's been too.  When he is again at a new school, everything changes.  His teacher suddenly shifts into a monster and tries to kill him.  His best friend has goat legs.  And Percy finds out he's really the son of a Greek god.      After thinking he lost his mom and almost dying himself, Percy is sent to Camp Halfblood, a camp for children of Greek Gods.  He likes at first, this is where he belongs and he finally found it.  But soon after he discovers who his father is and the troubles that go along with it.  He's accused of stealing the master bolt from Zeus and the only way to disprove this, is to retrieve the bolt himself.  The book is a great read and a ton of fun.  I can read that book a million times and never get bored.  It's a book that will never be forgotten.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I've read several reviews regarding the issue of \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy.\\" As it turns out, you need an application to play your digital copy (DC) called Flixter. The million dollar question that everyone is asking is if you're still able to play it on your iPod, other devices. The answer is no. To play your DC, you need to be online. What's the point? If I was on a plane, train etc with no internet access, how am I to enjoy a movie that I paid for? As the number of combo movie purchases are made, Flixter (DC) offers a nasty alternative and I hope Flixter dwindles.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I enjoyed The Night Circus more than any other book I've read this year! It's whimsical, captivating, and I couldn't put it down. The vivid storytelling brought to life each character and circus tent. My only disappointment is not being able to visit the circus in person now the book has ended. Bravo!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of those book that just keeps you on the edge of your seat, and keeps you turning pages. My only complaint is that it was so enjoyable that I breezed through it quicker than I would have liked!
0142000671|4.0|I read this book a long time ago.  The first time around I liked it.  But that was all.  I just liked it.  This second time around, I realized that I love the book.    It's Steinbeck's style to write simply.  Those that are wise know that it's not truly simply.  There's a moral to everything he writes-there's a message.  I learned a lot through this simply written book.  Our two main characters are Lenny and George.  George: Quick-witted and hard working.  He's a man with a dream and he's determined to get there.  He hasn't always been this way, and his perspective has drastically changed over the years.    Lenny: A simple minded man.  He doesn't understand the world around him and he uses George as a crutch.  He's a big guy who usually scares people and he has a habit to ruin things by mistake.  Thus, he's a loving person.  Once again, the pair has been run out of town because of Lenny's misunderstanding.  George intends to raise enough money to get their own place and be relatively far away from society.  This is the their last hope.  The question is, can Lenny handle it?  This is, of course, an American classic and for good reason.  There is so much depth and reason.  I loved reading the short tale and as mentioned, I learned a lot and gained insight.
0061743526|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is a novel about race, class, and coming of age in 1930's Alabama. The novel's protagonist is a young girl named Scout who lives with her father,  a lawyer named Atticus, and her older brother, named Jem. The beginning of the novel depicts an entire culture through the lens of a single year narrated by Scout. Scout spends the summer playing with her brother and her friend Dill, a short, smart, stubborn boy who leads the children into an investigation of the town's biggest mystery: the Radleys. The Radleys are Scout's reclusive neighbors, and according to the legend surrounding them, their son Arthur Radley, known as \\"Boo,\\" has been locked up in their house for many years after stabbing his father in the leg. In the first part of the book the children try everything they can to lure Boo out of the Radley's home. Later in the book, Scout's father agrees to defend a black man accused of raping a young white woman. The case causes a controversy in the town and Scout is heckled in school for being the daughter of a man unusual enough to take on the role of defending an African-American. Despite Atticus's strong showing in court the jury's racism leads them to reach a guilty verdict. The novel ends with Scout finally understanding her father's advice to \\"always put yourself in somebody else's skin and walk around in it\\" before judging a situation.     The novel's main strength is the way it convincingly conjures the life of a small southern town. As a reader you feel like you're part of the community. For example, during the court case you feel proud of Atticus, as if he were your own father. When Atticus, in his closing argument, tells the jury that the case is \\"as simple as black and white,\\" you feel the force and moral clarity of his perspective. On the other hand, the novel's ending is frustrating. As a reader you would like the author to leave the ending as more of a mystery. Instead Lee wraps up all the loose ends in a rushed and unsatisfying way. We are told that Scout never sees Arthur again with no explanation. It would have been more satisfying if Lee had either left the story open-ended or had gone on for another fifty pages detailing each character's future. Overall I give this book nine-stars out of ten.   By Alba
B0055MBQOM|5.0|After sending off some photos to be printed and having them come back looking rather orange, I researched calibration devices and settled on this.  For one thing, this is the calibration device that was recommended by the professional print lab that I used.  I am not hugely technical and this was easy for me to follow.  It guides you step by step through the process and in about 5 minutes you have a calibrated monitor.  I really like that it has a reminder feature with the software.  Once a week, it reminds me to recalibrate my monitor. Really easy and effective!
B005AUWY2W|2.0|Cars 2 was an Ok movie, but I'm really disappointed in the bonus features. I use to love watching the hours of great looks behind the scenes Pixar use to include on their DVD and Blu-rays. With each release they become skimpier and skimpier. One Mater Tale, which is only a commercial for the new Pixar show \\"Planes\\", the Toy Story short, and a director commentary, that's it! I feel short changed. We use to get tours of Pixar, got to sit in on story conferences, deleted scenes, concept art ect. I guess they are saving that for the double dip. Pixar use to be all about bang for the buck, since Disney took over they seem to only be about the buck.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As much as I enjoyed this series as a whole, this Mockingjay left me feeling a bit disappointed. Numerous times throughout the book I felt that Collins rushed the story along. Instead of us getting to live out the action, Haymitch filled Katniss in on what had happened. Or we are filled in what happened while she was injured/passed out/etc. I just felt that at times, it was a cop out.  I still really enjoyed this book, however, and would recommend it highly. But in comparison to the first two in the series, this one is sub-par.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This is the second Tony Bennett Duet album that I've bought.  It's just great!  Who would have thought that I'd do backflips over Lady Gaga doing \\"Lady is a Tramp\\" with Bennett?  I never even heard Lady Gaga sing before.  [I just wrote her off as a goofball.]  Yet she was just marvelous and I'd love to hear her sing more legit songs again. Of course I was familiar with many of his duet partners, but if it weren't for Bennett I wouldn't have had the opportunity to hear THEM sing these WONDERFUL OLD FAVORITES!!! This album shows taste and musicianship, and best of all I was MOVED emotionally many times. This CD is packed with surprises: Like Faith Hill singing \\"The Way You Look Tonight.\\" I happen to be a big Queen Latifah fan [as an actress] and of course I knew she can sing, but would I have heard her sing \\"Who Can I Turn To?\\" if she didn't record it with Bennett?  This album makes you LISTEN to singers you might normally skip over in your daily like. One of my favorite songs is \\"Yesterday I Heard The Rain\\" - but I never even heard of Alejandro Sanz until today. Josh Groban should sing more songs like \\"This is All I Ask.\\"  I had heard the name Carrie Underwood but if you held a gun to my head I couldn't tell you ANYTHING about her. But once you hear her sing, \\"It Had To Be You,\\" a song I've sung a thousand times - you'll know who Carrie Underwood is with her very pretty voice and unique sound. I never even heard of the song, \\"When Do the Bells Ring for Me\\" until I heard the Bennett duet with Mariah Carey. It's probably a life changing experience for the singers and the listeners. Thanks Tony!
B004SBQAN8|4.0|I AM NUMBER FOUR is one of them guilty pleasures. You see the film, find yourself damn entertained, but then can't look yourself in the mirror come the morning. You note the triteness of the plot, the cheesy dialogue, how everyone looks like they stepped out of a fashion magazine (even the resident nerd is, to quote my girlfriend, &#34;a hottie&#34;), and you marvel that this isn't an even bigger train wreck. Me, I love train wrecks. I am clamoring for a sequel. I mean, the book series already has a sequel.<br /><br />Not that the film goes much into it, but the title supports the conceit that nine extraterrestrial children from the planet Lorien have fled to Earth seeking sanctuary, pursued by another alien race, the murderous Mogadorians. Having scattered to the winds, the children can only be killed in numerical order (as I've said elsewhere, this sucks for &#34;Number One&#34;). &#34;John Smith&#34; (not his real name) was nine years old near the border of Mexico when the first scar seared itself onto his ankle, heralding the murder of the first child. He was twelve in Colorado in the midst of a spelling bee when the second scar surfaced. The third scar appeared whilst he was at a beach party, while he was, in fact, swimming with a fine chick (who then proceeds to label him a freak when he starts reacting to the painful ankle burn). The film doesn't bother to clearly explain that the charms the Lorien children wear are what keeps the sequential kill mandate activated. This is just one of the many plot holes inhabiting this film, so many plot holes than even Swiss cheese is amazed. Off the top of my head, here are several other wrong turns. I think the story needed to drop a smidge of foreshadowing regarding the beagle Bernie Kosar. Later in the film, when the beagle does what it does, it's one of those jarring &#34;What the what?&#34; moments. Also, apparently, not even running for your life should hinder you from setting aside some time to develop film.<br /><br />I'll be brutally honest and say that Alex Pettyfer doesn't much impress me with his acting skills. He performs his screen obligations stolidly, acquits himself pretty okay. Plus, he's cut and, in the eyes of the Hollywood moguls, that's enough to attract the babes. And he represents well during the action moments, and let me mention that the action sequences are very well-executed. Unfortunately, Pettyfer and his romantic interest, GLEE's Dianna Agron, exhibit the awkward rapport often found between a harried customer and a call center operator on meds. Dianne Agron's character is deeply interested in photography, and this is what the film calls character development. The rest of us call it taking a shortcut.<br /><br />John Smith - a.k.a. &#34;Number Four&#34; - and his guardian Henri (also an alien and not French, although there may not be much difference) relocate to the small town of Paradise, Ohio, and if the plan was for John to stay under the radar, that doesn't work out too well. These nine Lorien children at some point all develop &#34;Legacies&#34; (a.k.a. super powers) and when John's legacies begin to flare up, he causes a stir or two or three... John Smith is also one of them righteous kids what can't tolerate someone getting bullied. At his new school, he stands up for a nerdy UFO-obsessed kid named Sam. Except that championing the bottom of the food chain gets you noticed. John isn't exactly blending in. The Mogadorians - sporting the latest reject apparel from the Matrix line and, for some unexplored reason, gills - are soon sniffing out John and Henri's trail.<br /><br />For all the predictable story beats and the pandering, you can't fault the visual effects and the spectacular fighty fights. And, inasmuch as a late entrance can propel the third act of a narrative, the arrival of the gorgeous, vigorous, kickbuttt Number Six (Teresa Palmer) juices things up, reshuffles the dynamics. I may clown on the film and its pitfalls, but I think the premise is cool and there's enough base mythology introduced here that a well-thought-out sequel can really fuel this franchise. And, also, I'm an action junkie. And the mighty beagle Bernie Kosar - once you get past the &#34;What the what?&#34; - is just awesome. On that note, 3.5 out of 5 stars for this puppy.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features: Bloopers and &#34;Becoming Number Six&#34; (a segment tracking Teresa Palmer as she undergoes training and performs her rigorous stunts; 00:11:43 minutes long).se is cool and there's enough base mythology introduced here that a well-thought-out sequel can really fuel this franchise.

0062060554|4.0|I sort of felt as though I were a kid again, with a flashlight under the covers, reading \\"Nancy Drew\\" when I ought to have been asleep. It has been years since I read a book so obsessively. The author had me from the opening page, and the sense of foreboding and tension was maintained throughout. After I finished the book, I kept wondering if it were plausible. Could this have really happened? Then I heard a story on NPR about a woman due to run a marathon who has lost her memory when she had a stroke after surgery for a brain tumor. ([...]) She mentioned having to keep notes to herself to remember that she had already eaten lunch, etc. The whole brain injury part of this is fascinating. But, you know, just let the author take you along for the ride. For a debut novel, he does an amazing job of keeping you guessing (or me, anyway) right up to the end. And yes, it is written by a man. Early on, I had to google the name, S.J. Watson, because I became very curious about who had written this book, since it is told from inside a woman's head. This is not at all literary fiction, with passages that make you pause and think. This is a roller coaster ride, and once you get on, you just cannot stop til you know the answers. Well done, Mr. Watson!  (**I should add that I read the British version. I ordered it from the UK because I had read in some reviews that the American version was slightly changed, and I didn't want a bowdlerized version. The British references are, after all, part of the charm.)(less)
B004LROUNG|1.0|Having read almost all of Mr. Grisham's other books, I found this one a great disappointment.  The characters are caricatures of people, which one doesn't mind in an adventure, but this was a lecture on mass tort law and its misuse. Reminded me of an educational comic book.  Looking forward to the next Grisham book, hopefully more to my taste.  I know he can do it so well.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Fantastic movie. Loved it. If you like courtroom drama you'll like this movie. I felt guilty because I only paid .99 cents for this movie.
1451648537|5.0|Not yet quite finished with the book, but the few chapters I've consumed has turned this book into one of my best reads in the last couple years. I can't even remember being interested in reading 'biographies' in the past, but this one was too good to pass up. Issaacson does an excellent job, and it's quite surprising that the very private Steve Jobs even allowed someone like Issaacson (this book's author) to interview him so closely and so candidly. Without giving away any spoilers, I'll just add that this book does confirm one thing. Love him or hate him, Steve Jobs was very human.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|This film baffles me.It's hard to find a movie that's bad in every possible way. Most of the time when I walk out of the theater I can say that I liked at least one thing about the movie I just such as, the soundtrack, one of the characters or a specific scene. Sadly, from start to finish Gi Joe fails in every conceivable way. This film is terribly written (even by action movie standards), badly directed, and horribly miscast. I understand that this isn't suppose to be a thinking movie, but there are plenty of stupid movies that are fun to watch. The target audience for this film appears to five year olds, which is ok I guess. I just expected a little more (at least until I saw production photos). It's like I have incredibly high standards or anything. Yes I am a fan of the 1980's era Gi Joe, but unlike most, I have always believed that Gi Joe could have been a lot cooler if somebody decided to craft a story and develope characters that are a little less flamboyant, silly, and over-the-top. The makers of Rise of Cobra did try to bring Gi Joe in a new direction, it's just that it sucked. I should have known when I found out that Stephen Sommers was the director that this movie was going to be a turd. Somers is the hack behind Van Helsing, The Scorpion King and other garabage movies. If you're five or suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome pop this sucker in, otherwise stay away. For fans of Gi Joe I recommend that animated Gi Joe Resolute thing, a thousand times better in my opinion.
1461190460|1.0|I love The Little Prince and have read it numerous times, but this particular copy that Amazon sells is absolutely terrible. Shame on Amazon for selling this reprint that doesn't even look remotely like it was published by a publisher with rights to the book. It looks like someone printed it out of a regular printer, put it together, and put it up on here to make a quick buck. There are no words for the injustice this copy does to the original book. The resolution of the graphics are horrible (just like someone took it from the Internet), it comes off as a shady reprint of the original, the cover itself is pixelated. This in no way even looks like a legal copy of the classic Little Prince books. Shame on Amazon for selling this poor imitation of a wonderful classic. I am returning this and warning everyone looking at this particular product not to buy it. Look for another copy of the Little Prince. Don't get this one.

B005E7AOHI|5.0|It's a comfort to know Les Claypool is still kicking out some of the most innovative and exciting music out there. I purchased the first Primus album the day it came out and have seen them on tour six times in Chicago. On Green Naugahyde, you will find echoes of albums past along with new ideas that combine into a delicious green soup of sound. Primus music grows on you like moss, a friendly fungus of funk that gets inside your head and sticks there leaving a nice creamy feeling in your eardrums.
B004EPZ084|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie as a laugh out loud comedy. I usually am offended by crude humor, but I thought every joke was funny. If you see the trailer to this movie, you know exactly what your getting. One boss is a psycho (Kevin Spacey), one boss is a real tool(Colin Farrell), and the the other one is a female sexual harasser black mailer (Jenifer Aniston). The movie is packed with cameos of well known stars. If your an adult, and can handle profanity, I would recommend this movie. (I think Jennifer Aniston's behavior in the dentist office is what gave this movie an \\"R\\" rating).
B005LJK3AC|1.0|If you enjoy the humor of middle schoolers or high schoolers this is the movie for you.  The movie moved rather slow at the start and then fell into uncreative plot devices in an effort to be humorous.  And let's not forget the little stab at 10 years for video piracy.  Hmmmmm makes you wonder what corporate drone wanted to make sure THAT made it on the script.  Save your money..it's not worth it.

0811826848|5.0|I was completely blown away by the TV / video Anthology project and was almost just as much blown away by the book.  The Anthology book contains interview segments from the three living Beatles (at least, at that time three were living) either in extended form, or segments that were not used in the videos at all.  This adds new life to the project, as you get different and expanded versions of their unique, rich story.  The Anthology is the only place that I know of where you can hear the Beatles tell their own story.  I find it fascinating to not only read about their lives, but also looking at the fantastic photographs that are published in here.  For newbies (if there are still any out there!) this is the most definitive place to start, and even for those who have listened to Beatles music for years, there is nothing like the massive amount of information presented here.  From their humble beginnings, to their American success, their historic concert at Shea Stadium, John's comments on Jesus which led to the demise of their touring days in '66, through Sgt Pepper and eventually the breakup, it's all here is extensive detail.  This book is a Beatles fan's ultimate collection of facts and pictures, and make sure to also get the CDs and DVDs which bring the sights and sounds to life.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|This is a powerful movie. It starts out slowly, mainly focusing on a man, Jacob, whom for the first half of the movie I did not like. He was too self-focused and abrasive.  As the movie starts, Jacob is working in an orphanage in India, but is called to Norway by a multi-millionaire, Jorgen, who says he will donate money to the orphanage. When Jacob meets with Jorgen, Jorgen procrastinates and says he is still considering and invites Jacob to attend his daughter's wedding the next day. At the wedding Jacob meets Jorgan's wife, whom he recognizes as someone he knew many years ago. And thus the story begins.   This movie is superbly directed by Susanne Bier, who has directed several highly noted movies centering on how families behave during crisis situations, like \\"Brothers\\", about interactions between two brothers when one is sent to the war in Afghanistan, and \\"In a Better World\\" that won the 2011 Academy Award for best foreign film.   After the wedding is subtle in some ways, obvious in others; but it will demand your attention and engage your emotions the whole way. I don't know if it will have you squirming in your seat, as one reviewer says, but he is correct when he says you will be unsettled. The movie has strongly affecting visceral elements and I found myself thinking about different segments days later. The movie was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007, but lost out to \\"The Lives of Others\\", another outstanding film.
B004QSQML8|1.0|I have loved this movie since I was in grade school. I was sadly disappointed to find out that the movie was bunk when I received it. The blu ray had no sound whatsoever. The amount of time to return the item was so minimal it wasn't an option. I love the movie but do not reccomend this seller at all.
0142001104|5.0|Literally I learned about this book after attending Ben Zander's talk at Pop Tech in 2008 (link) where the entire audience was called upon to sing together with emotion and harmony. Surprising to us all was how powerful and emotionally jarring this simple act was. My co-worker and I were sobbing. I figured after being taken aback so unexpectedly that I should give his book a try. Expecting honestly that I was done crying over nothing, but I did find the same emotional energy in the book itself. I was motivated, inspired, in awe, and more than once in tears. Ben's personality comes out in this book and it's extraordinarily (warm, loving). He reminds me that ... you really are the master of your own emotions and own perspective. He's helped me not absorbed in frustration and drama more than I ever expected from a lecture and a book.
1423140591|4.0|Rick Riordan does another masterful job of blending the Greek and Roman mythologies together.  Son of Neptune sets off with a flourish and doesn't stop until the cliff hanger ending.  Through the eyes of Percy Jackson we get to see how the Greek and Roman camps are different and how the campers are treated differently.  Campers are assigned to to cohorts instead of by who their godly parent is.  We also are shown how the Greek and Roman gods are different.  In Riordan's earlier books Ares is a bully always pushing for a fight.  As Mars the God of War is more of a tactician and a reluctant warrior.  Riordan also does an excellent job of creating believable characters who have self-doubt but who also learn to be confident and are decisive when the time comes.  Frank's feelings of being clumsy all the time to taking a lead role in the final battle is the perfect example.  Another fantastic read and I look forward to the next installment.
B004XQO90O|4.0|Duncan Jones' \\"Source Code\\" is a taut sci-fi thriller, of which intriguing premise may remind us of a 1993 movie \\"Groundhog Day.\\" Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, a military helicopter pilot, who is given a near impossible task to find out the terrorist responsible for the recent train bombing in Chicago.   Assuming the identity of a victim on the doomed train, Colter is sent back to \\"relive\\" the eight minutes before the bomb goes off. Like Bill Murray's hapless protagonist, Colter is forced to live the same eight minutes again and again by Jenkins (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), who are desperate to know who the terrorist is.  Despite the time-loop concept the entire film is based on, director Duncan Jones employs a simple narrative style to focus the characters and their interactions. The result is a surprisingly emotional conclusion (like Jones' previous thriller \\"Moon\\"), in which the protagonist Colter has to face the inevitable.  As an action thriller \\"Source Code\\" is fast-paced and slick, but perhaps some viewers might feel the idea of reliving the same eight minutes is underdeveloped. The reaction is understandable, but the film is not just about the process of detecting the terrorist (which is considerably suspenseful), but about the change that happens in the hero, who comes to see those strangers on the train as humans with feelings and stories. On that score the film delivers.

0307454541|3.0|I resisted reading this book when it was the rage. I am glad I did. It was unpublished at the time of Stieg Larsen's death and was translated by Steven Murray under the pen name Reg Keland. It won awards in Sweden and Great Britain, including Best First Novel. Originally titled \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" in Swedish, I waded through 600 pages waiting for a shock that never came. Not a bad story mind you, but the \\"twists and turns\\" reviewers gushed about simply weren't there. More importantly, the combination of translation from Swedish to English and a hesitation by the editor to take a knife to the first novel of a man who has passed-on, really hurt what would have been an okay story.<br /><br />Larsen's gift was his ability to create three-dimensional characters, particularly the book's namesake, Lisbeth Salander, a pierced, inked waif with Asperger's Syndrome. Their quirks came through the translation unblemished and were the best part of the story. The book needed to be pared-down from 600 pages to perhaps 400. The old writer's axiom of \\"Get it written and then get it right,\\" kept coming to mind. I won't be reading books 2 and 3 of the trilogy. I fear they have probably suffered the same production failures, which is a shame.<br /><br />The work of Greg Iles kept coming to mind as I read Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Iles takes his readers to the same dark side of human nature as Larsen-- with the benefit of an editor with a sharp pen. I give Girl with the Dragon Tattoo it 3 out of 5 stars-- not a bad book, but certainly not up to all the hype.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These are an extremely good set of headphones. I expected very high quality in sound and build characteristics and that is what the Superlux hd 681 cans are, the sound is crisp and clean. Similar to some of the other reviews, the highs are a bit bright but it is not bad enough that it turns me off from wanting these headphones. They are great for the money and I would recommend them time after time from now on.

B005FUTBV4|4.0|Red State is written and directed by Kevin Smith, but you'd never, ever know it upon viewing it.  The man who brought us Clerks, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, Chasing Amy, and more besides has gone out of his way to craft a surprisingly taut film that is half psychological thriller and half action/thriller.  Red State revolves around three high school guys that are lured into a trap with the promise of sex over the internet, only to find themselves trapped by an extreme Christian fundamentalist group (led by the great Michael Parks who channels Westboro Baptist Church-leading hate monger Fred Phelps) that have plans that no one around sees coming.  What helps make Red State so good is the fact that it fully displays that Kevin Smith has matured technically as a filmmaker.  The action and suspense scenes are taut and well-executed, and are made all the better thanks to the well-chosen cast, which also includes recent Oscar winner Melissa Leo and John Goodman as an ATF agent that shines in the film's climactic showdown.  All in all, Red State is a pleasent surprise from Kevin Smith, and proof positive that the man can do way more than toilet and stoner humor.

B004W4N55C|5.0|a great app that I would have paid $5 for if I had know how great it could be. the tab lookup is quite quick and with narrowing options; the resizable screen on the tabs was nice and the option to auto scoll at an adjustable speed is sweet. the 'tools' section with metronome, tuner and chords (with strumable strings and inversions) was impressive. one of the best all-in-one guitar programs out there.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|After much listening to \\"Loutallica's\\" Lulu I now understand what it is. It is the sonic equivalent of a 16 car pileup on the freeway... WITH - the chicken truck! It is so bad that mouth's are on the floor and you can't just look away. I can hear the mangled little chicken's running around screaching. Flap flap, flap flap flap, someone put them out of their misery!<br /><br />Dave Mustaine must be in hog heaven today!!!<br /><br />When I heard that the new Metallica/Lou Reed collaboration had set new LOW sales records... I had to get it! Their worst piece of plastic used to be St. Anger (which I bought and didn't entirely hate), which sold 480,000 units opening day. This sold a big spiffy 15,000! I am streaming it now at work straight off the Loutallica website they set up - very low volume mind you, my boss works on the other side of the wall. It is so abysmally horrible I can't wait until my CD arrives! I'm sure this will disappear making this a rare CD to have but I'm buying it because, well... the pileup mentioned above, I can't look away.  The ONLY redeeming thing on the entire disc IS Lou Reed's poetry and the story he has created.  And of course, the artwork that went along with the CD, that actually WAS pretty cool.  They should have just marketed that without the music, the kickass photography, the posters, etc.  So five stars on the art and the poetry...  the rest is, oh no, the chickens, flap flap flap, I can't get them out of my mind!  Please, for the love of all that is holy, \\"I AM NOT THE TABLE!\\"
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I'm a speaker and wanted to be able to move around the room as I record. Works great for that because the cord is so long. I had to buy an adapter to make it work with my iPhone 4. The pop filter that comes with this mic really works to cut down on the pops when saying words that start with a \\"p.\\" Easy to lose though so expect to buy more. The clip for the mic comes off easily too so keep a close watch and go ahead and buy extras.  This product could be improved if they add a light to indicate if it's on or not. Easy to burn out the battery because of this. Buy lots of extra batteries and use a fresh one when you're recording something important.   A retractable cord would be great too. To keep it from getting tangled into a complete mess, I hold three fingers out and slowly wrap the cord. Then I use a twisty to keep it together. When I get ready to use, I unwind using my three fingers and unwrap very slowly.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|What I expect to see when reading reviews on a new remastering is a comment on the quality of the new mastering, both video and sound.  No one needs comments on the film itself at this point; we all know what we know about these old films.  When is Amazon going to do us the favor of letting us know only what applies to the new and current offering?  Do I really need to throw away my very good DVD and purchase the blu-ray?  This criticism, of course, does not merely apply to the current offering here but to all items offered on Amazon--cd reviews, book reviews, etc--to all remasterings of classical music and book reprintings.  It too rarely happens that reviewers tell one what improvements in quality are in evidence over older offerings.  That is all I need and want when trying to decide whether the new is sufficiently superior to the old I have.  In addition, I have been waiting for years for THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS to appear on DVD.  Why are we now not allowed to purchase it as a single item?
0061438294|3.0|Most of the things in this book are fairly obvious signs.  However, that really is the nature of a lot of help or self learning books.  That said, it is pretty well written and the pictures are helpful to help you understand what's going on.  Overall, the book's main message is to stop being so self absorbed and pay attention to other people's body language.
B0034G4P80|1.0|This was the worst super hero movie I have seen in a while. Green Lantern blows this away. What an overblown piece of crap. Don't waste your time
B0057R5XRG|1.0|This review will not focus on the poor quality of the Blu-Ray discs themselves; simply put, it's poor--very grainy, and the skin tones are often pinkish. That's not the biggest problem. The major problem lies with the BD Live feature. As soon as I inserted the discs, after the Universal Pictures intro, the screen said the BD Live feature was enabled and was downloading BD content from the Internet. Then the screen went black and sat there. And sat there. And sat there. Nothing happened. The only way to back out of this was to repeatedly press stop or eject, then start over; but guess what? Once you insert the disc again, the same BD Live process recurred. There is NO way around this unless you go into your BD player's setup menu and completely disable BD Live capabilities. Of course, after doing this, I was faced with the nag message before movie playback of the fact that my BD Live feature was not functioning and that I would lack certain BD Live features (whatever they might be). I'll repeat this very major problem by summarizing it again: upon inserting the disc, you can't go to the menu, setup, or even play the movie. It immediately goes into BD Live mode to connect to the Internet to download something but never does; it just hangs at a black screen.  So, back to Amazon.com this goes for an exchange. I will test out another set. I might just test another set I already have and had gift wrapped for Christmas for someone. Regardless, the set I bought and that has been giving me the aforementioned BD Live problem is going back for an exchange.
159420229X|5.0|I put off reading this book for nearly seven months after purchasing it on my Kindle because, while curious about the subject, I thought it would be a boring read.  I read it in a day.  It was a very fun read and I took a lot of references and other ideas from this book that will generate further reading and investigation.  I realize this is a vague review, but I assure you this is a fun and interesting book to read.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|I'm not typically one for Science Fiction, and as much as I am a macho, macho man I just can't handle Stephen King's ultra-creepy horror style.    And though I read a lot of fiction I rarely read a book quickly unless I'm stuck on an airplane.  I might read half a chapter tonight, then skip a day or two, then read some pages when I'm in the mood, and so on.  But I absolutely COULD NOT PUT DOWN this cross of horror story slash sci-fi novel slash corporate espionage slash suspenseful thriller.  And the moment I finished I went in search of the sequel.  There are hundreds of reviews on Amazon, so I'll just say:  -DON'T READ TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS BOOK.  The plot is just too fun to discover as you go along.   -DON'T PUT OFF ORDERING THE SEQUEL, \\"Freedom,\\" because while Daemon has an ending it also has a cliffhanger.    -DON'T READ THE DESCRIPTION TO \\"FREEDOM,\\" though, until you finish Daemon.  -DON'T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU DO NOT LIKE GROTESQUE, blood-filled action and description.  -DON'T MISS IT HOWEVER IF you can possibly hang in there through blood-filled action and description; it's worth it.

B005LZZMRK|5.0|I absolutely love the sound and feel of this album. Insurgentes varies from great to meh in my opinion, but this one grabs you from the start and won't let go. I also had the amazing experience of seeing Steven Wilson live on the Grace for Drowning tour in Berlin. Get tickets now if you are anywhere near the remaining tour dates. I would absolutely disagree with those saying Raider II is too long or should have been cut. I would consider it the best track on the album.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc, is a industry classic. The product description says it all (minus the live version of real people). I would reccommend this movie to anybody.

A must have for anyone concerened with what they are putting into their bodies.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Engaging story, great music, and quality acting. Possibly my favorite movie of all time. It captures a time and culture but is made timeless by it's story of adolescence and family.
B003Y5H57Y|3.0|In this day and age of remakes, prequels and reboots, and other endless franchise padding, it only seemed inevitable that John Carpenter's The Thing, which forever became known as a cult classic after it tanked hardcore in cinemas, would get the honour. Or is it a dishonour? That certainly seems inevitable, as the reaction to the fact it is getting a prequel of sorts got a mixed reception when announced some time ago.<br /><br />A fan of the original film, I tend to take a disliking to prequels in general. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but I find prequels tend to ruin what you liked about a piece of work in the first place. Remember Lucas' three-part turd he dropped on us some time ago? Yeah. Let's not go there. But, if done right, a prequel can be entertaining. This year, two prequels got released that entertained me lots; X-Men First Class, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And then, this got released.<br /><br />The film is essentially a prequel, or so it says, to the 1982 remake of the '55 film. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World) is a brilliant, young and beautiful scientist, studying in Antartcica. The Norewigans have discovered a mysteriously unknown apparatus in the ice, and invite Mary and her team to investigate. They stumble upon a gigantic ice block with a seemingly mysterious creature inside it. Thiking they have discovered something incredible, they transport it back to base, and celebrate.<br /><br />However, on the night of the celebration they discover the ice is melting faster than usual, and in a rather effective jump scare, the thing escapes. Now their doom has been sealed, and death, chaos and destruction is about to happen. The terror is heightened when they realize that there is no true specimen. It has a way of letting its cells get into the people and imitating them, thus turning into the thing itself.<br /><br />Now, I will say that there's a lot to love about this movie, but unfortunately there's a lot to hate about it too, and it gets to the point where you're not sure if you should think it's a good movie or a bad movie.<br /><br />However, I could very well be blowing steam up this film's ass, but I would consider it to not be a bad movie at all. First off, the movie is well shot, and has a nice atmosphere, though it doesn't have a scratch on the first movie in terms of the two. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic, and manages to make her character in the film totally believable due to her performance. The score is excellent too, it mixes in a higher budget film sound with the creepiness of Morricone's score.<br /><br />In addition, the special effects are nice. Of course nothing can touch the original's practical effects that make me cringe and gag lots yet still scare the hell out of me all these years later, but the digital special effects manage to impress. Problem is, that the magic of the effects are gone in this film, I couldn't be grossed out by it at all. Instead it's just... Digital.<br /><br />However, there is a fair deal to hate about this film too, like I mentioned. For one, the most obvious being that this just seems too much the same as the first. There's even the obligatory \\"we must have a test of some sort to see who's real\\" scene that was done incredibly much better in the 1982 film. And the only reassurance that it's a prequel is the scene during the credits at the end, which, while the best part of the movie, all so simultaneously feels like an excuse for the film to say \\"just in case you forgot, I'm a prequel!\\". It just feels... there.<br /><br />Another thing about the film is that it almost completely missed the point of the original, as another reviewer on IMDb correctly put it. The thing has to be alone in the room with you for it to get ahold of your cells. This is completely urinated all over in the film, as if the writers haven't seen the original film. And this isn't helped by a big lipped alligator moment near the end, which in addition tobeing in a last act that tries to explain The Thing, features a scene where Kate jumps on top of the spaceship and a bizarre video/hologram thingy starts. A total nuke the fridge moment.<br /><br />In short, I don't know what to think about this film at all. It isn't bad, and I would watch it before the latest Michael Bay movie, indeed, but unfortunately, it seems all too obvious that this won't be one I can recommend. Not even to fans of the original, mainly because it's as if it were designed for people with low attention spans. That said, strangely enough, I would say it's worth watching at least once- that's just how polarizing the film is.<br /><br />OVERALL: 5/10<br /><br />THE GOOD: The Thing is a nicely atmospheric and shot prequel to the first movie, which features nice creepy tension and a good amount of scares.<br /><br />THE BAD: In addition to being a rehash, it seems like it's rather just the first movie designed for people with A.D.D. and methadone for The Thing addicts.e jumps on top of the spaceship and a bizarre video/hologram thingy starts.

0345529057|5.0|Having read and thoroughly enjoyed A Game of Thrones, I bought the four book boxed set to continue the enjoyment. Am almost through A Clash of Kings and I must say George RR Martin has maintained the complexity of the plot/s and the quality of the writing. This is a classic tale in the manner of The Lord of the Rings, only better and more engrossing. Once you are into it, and that's easier than getting into The Lord of the Rings, you are truly hooked and will stay up nights to find out what happens next. Martin keeps you guessing as the plot progresses and unfolds.<br />Am waiting for the HBO Blue Ray first season set to become available and have placed an order with Amazon.<br />Long may George RR Martin write for and thrive!
B005FDWIGQ|5.0|The supporting characters -- particularly Skyler to Walt Jr. -- really come into their own this season, but the standout for me is Giancarlo Esposito as Gus. The range of emotions he is able to convey while maintaining a deadpan exterior facade of calm and normalcy is absolutely amazing. Walt's descent and Jesse's descent and rise after bottoming out are riveting to watch, as well. I'm just three episodes from the conclusion of Season Four and don't want it to end.

The concert is so creative and sexy, the musicians have talent beyond our world and I could not take my eyes off Shakira. Shakira and Alejandro Sanz sizzled the stage and melted my TV. Wyclef Jean and incredible dancers rocked the house. You do not need to know Spanish, Arabic or any other language - the music and Shakira's dancing is so powerful, believe me, you'll understand. Next time she tours, I'm all over it and I've already ordered Shakira other concerts.

1439192812|5.0|My 12 year old son is gaining valuable consciousness. Another great book by a fantastic scientist. I highly recommend this book for all ages over 12 years old.
0062060554|4.0|I was a little skeptical of this book when I first started it.  The plot seemed so blatantly set up for a mindless page turner.  I have nothing against page turners, but with many, if not most of them, I feel just a little bit dumber afterwards for having read them, my intelligence insulted.  That was not the case with this book.  The plot was indeed engaging, but it was also well written and with enough food for thought to satisfy the intellectual elitist in me.  This is a pretty good in depth look at how critical memory is to the development of our identities.  Without our memories, we are nobody.  There were certainly a lot of twists in this book, as I think anyone would expect.  I don't think there are any twists that are so mind-blowing that you won't have at least considered them beforehand, but the turns in the plot are for the most part well-earned and well-handled.    It's true that the book does become just a little repetitive, but this is probably unavoidable, and maybe even desirable.  The protagonist is stuck in a kind of reverse Groundhog Day scenario, where she's reliving the same day over and over and over, but, in this case, the rest of the world is moving on.  She relives the same heartbreaks every day, goes through many of the same discoveries every day.  Her journal is really the only tool she has to link one day to the next.  So, yes, there's some repetition, but the author for the most part keeps things moving forward at a good pace.

B005QPGHQU|4.0|Judging from the bad reviews, I expected this album to be a failure, but I decided to make the purchase after taking a nostalgic spin through my old DoubleDrive albums the other night(which was Troy's old band).  Surprisingly, 5 songs in, I am hooked.  This album is slightly more commercial than the past 2 albums, and also much more versatile in my opinion.  There is a greater mix of different tempo songs, songs in different keys, and not quite as much \\"falling\\" and \\"drowning\\", although there is still some to be found, haha.  To me it seems to have a more aggressive vibe than a pathetic vibe like I got from previous Evanescence releases, which brings me to this point, this is a rock album.  Do not expect 5 piano ballads, because there is a lot of guitar on this album, but that doesn't mean there is a lack of melody, because the melodies are great and abundant.  Amy's voice sounds great as usual.<br /><br />The only thing that bugs is the production.  It has fallen pray to the BIG LOUD OVER COMPRESSED MONSTER that is plaguing so many bands now.  Whoever is responsible for this trend needs to be keelhauled STAT, because I am \\"Sick of it All\\"!  We all have volume controls on our devices, so please stop distorting the audio in the mixing/mastering process.  THANKS!<br /><br />Maybe it's because I'm a guitar player, but I really dug all the great riffs and the arrangements of the songs.  Overall, I have to say this is a very strong release, and I really enjoyed it.  This self titled release will be getting more airplay on my ipod than their previous albums.

B005NPLXJ4|3.0|In the world of rock n roll, there are great ideas and terrible ideas for collaborations. Some are met with positive results and some just don't work at all. With a collaboration like Lou Reed and Metallica, it can go either way: it's going to be brilliant or it's going to be the worst thing ever made. The album, Lulu, has been getting panned by both critics and fans. I can see why: it's very difficult to sit through. For me, I'm in between about Lulu. Parts of it are really good and then there are some parts that terrible. For the eclectic and bizarre factor, I can honestly say that Lulu is a decent album for me. I know a bunch of people are going to think I'm crazy but I'm not crazy about this album. This is going to be a challenging listen for a lot of people.     The history of this album actually starts in 1895. A man named Frank Wedekind wrote the play Erdgeist, or Earth Spirit. In 1905, he wrote another play called Die Buchse der Pandora, or Pandora's Box. Wedekind referred to these plays as his \\"Lulu\\" plays, as both plays told the story of a tortured and abused ballerina of the same name. The plays would later become an opera and various other things. Robert Wilson, a theatre director, asked singer/songwriter Lou Reed to write a musical adaptation of the two plays. Reed agreed to do it. Around this time, Reed had jammed with Metallica at the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame's 25th anniversary concerts in 2009. Reed got to talk to the band and everybody got along. Drummer Lars Ulrich remembered Reed calling out \\"Let's do a record together!\\". Ulrich thought Reed was joking but alas, he was not. Earlier this year in 2011, Lou Reed and the members of Metallica (guitarists James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet, bassist Robert Trujillo, and drummer Lars Ulrich) were in the studio. Reed had written both the lyrics and music. Metallica's job was to play Reed's music. The album was completed in four days (though the liner notes say it was recorded from April 2011 to June 2011) andthis is the end result.     If there was an award for most random opening lyric, \\"Brandenburg Gate\\" would probably take it: \\"I would cut my legs and t**s off when I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski/In the dark of the moon\\". Fair enough, Lou. Once Lou is done singing the first two line, Metallica transitions the song to a heavier sound. Reed sings the lyrics while James Hetfield continuously sings in the background (and it can get annoying) \\"Small town girl\\". In terms of the sound and maybe some of the lyrics, \\"Brandenburg Gate\\" opens the album brilliantly. Next up is \\"The View\\", which fortunately has nothing to do with the Barbara Walters-hosted talk-show. The song was picked as the single for the album and when first released, the response wasn't great. I'll admit: \\"The View\\" is very difficult to listen to. However with music like this, it can get better once you listen to it over and over again. What may bother listeners about this song, as well as the rest of the album, is that Reed is reciting the lyrics rather than singing them. Metallica fans are going to hate this but for me, I've gotten use to it even before: Reed is an artist and in some ways, a poet. I will admit lyrics such as \\"I want you on the floor\\" sounds funny but Hetfield tops it off when he shouts \\"I AM THE TABLE!\\" No offense guys but that is flat-out hilarious! Still, \\"The View\\" is a decent song.     \\"Pumping Blood\\" starts off with the beautiful sounds of violins playing until Metallica comes in with one their vamping or crunching sounds. When Reed goes into his \\"singing\\", we got a song that sounds like a cross between something off Master of Puppets and something off Reed's Berlin or even New York. It does get annoying towards the end but I think \\"Pumping Blood\\" is a good song. \\"Mistress Dread\\", despite the heavy riffs, is excruciating to sit through. I dig the out-of-place lyrics Reed wrote but I get a headache even listening to this song. Luckily, \\"Iced Honey\\" cures the headache for a while asit has a great sound and beat. In fact, \\"Iced Honey\\" might be my favorite song of the album. Disc one (oh yeah, I forgot: this album is 85 minutes long. Let that sink in...) ends with \\"Cheat On Me\\". This song is more of a poetry track for Reed, which slowly evolves into a Metallica-sounding song. The lyrics are a bit monotonous and the song is eleven minutes long. They could've made this song much shorter.     Disc two opens with \\"Frustration\\", a great song for Metallica to just jam to. The guitar playing on this one is really good but Reed's lyrics are a little out of place again. Unlike \\"Mistress Dread\\", this one is much easier to listen to. Some of the lyrics are laughable: \\"To be dead to have no feeling/To be dry and spermless like a girl\\". \\"Little Dog\\" is a very creepy song. Seriously. It's just Reed singing to an acoustic guitar playing. Check out the lyrics for yourself as I don't think they'd be appropriate for Amazon standards. \\"Dragon\\" is another 11 minute song, mostly with Reed either ranting or reciting poetry. At the three minute mark, Metallica comes in with this great heavy sound.  While the lyrics are once again weird and out of place, there might be some truth in them. The album's last song, \\"Junior Dad\\", is a nice sounding song. It's very melodic and soft. However there is one problem with this song: it goes on for 19 MINUTES! I'm not kidding. Go look it up. Reed's lyrics and singing, however, are pretty good.     Despite many flaws, Lulu is still a decent album. I know a lot of people hate it and think of it as garbage. Compared to talent-less people who can't sing like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber or computerized crap like almost every rapper does now, Lulu stands out. In fact, I think everyone should at least listen to this album at least once. Both Lou Reed and Metallica have had lows in their careers. Reed had many flops over the years, the biggest probably being 1975's Metal Machine Music. Metallica has also experienced releasing some disappointing albums, the most notable probably being 2003's St. Anger. Overall, Lulu is a listening experience.
B001USHRCK|5.0|My daughters (ages 7 and 5) and I put this together, and we had an absolute blast. It makes a great companion set to either the Kingdoms or Castle sets. There are a lot of cool little extras that come with it -- even a tiny, green frog. Highly recommended.
185459768X|5.0|I don't read plays too often. But, in South Africa, it doesn't look as if we'll get His Dark Materials soon; some ridiculous religious right-wing groups successfully squashed the projected trilogy. This play is dense (in taking Philip Pullman's philosophies and explaining them, both verbally and non verbally) and at the same time gripping and easy to follow.  Will and Lyra's relationship (brilliantly foregrounded) and Pullman's insights are very well interpreted and dramatised by Nicholas Wright in this pacy, orginal and accessible play. Very very good indeed.
B001M0B740|5.0|I've listened to it three times and gain more insight each time. I am in the rehab field. Love to hear it from the patients point of view
B003L77G10|5.0|I LOVE IT! This must rate as one of the best legal dramas we've had for a long time. The issues raised, the interplay between characters, the realism... kudos to writers, actors and director(s).  Satisfying. Very satisfying :-)
B000OONTFU|5.0|I've owned this set on standard dvd when it was first released. I just received this HD-DVD set in the mail and as I'm writing this, I'm watching the first film. The video and audio are breathtaking and an obvious upgrade from DVD. I have a blu-ray player and could invest in the blu-ray version but I live on a budget and that version has rarely been lower than $40. I bought my HD-DVD set from a seller for $13 (includes shipping) and I still have my HD-DVD player for the Xbox 360. So the point is that for fans of the film and owners of operating HD-DVD players, obtaining of HD-DVD copy of this box set is cheap and the value of the high-def format is still there.<br /><br />A couple of minor complaints. 1) While the films and their respective supplemental material are on HD-DVDs, the Animatrix shorts are part of the Databank dvds and therefore not in high definition. I'm supposing this is different for the blu-ray version. 2) the great artwork and packaging for the DVD version of the set isn't replicated. This may apply for the blu-ray set as well. This includes the book with the Wachowski Bros intro and the program guides for all disc (although that stuff is included on disc). Like I said minor complaints.<br /><br />Great films, great transfers and all of the content from the DVD box sets (and I believe the individual sets) are included. You can find copies of this HD-DVD set really cheap as well. Highly recommended.
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|I have seen this movie in every decade of my life.  My opinion of the characters varies accordingly but my opinion of the movie never varies - I love it!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Without doubt THE best sitcom ever made anywhere. I still don't understand how unfunny shows such as Seinfeld always got the plaudits while Al, Peg and Co barely got a look in. Every episode is a classic.
0446573019|4.0|I've read both Baldacci and Child from day one but I had to honestly keep remind myself this was a Baldacci book.  Don't get me wrong, very good read, lots of action but seriously, most blatant ripoff of another author's formula that I've ever seen or a huge coincidence.  Baldacci's legal training may come in  handy over this one.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|This is a nice and reliable TODO app.  It's pretty much your basic TODO manager.  The main added feature is that your TODOs are organized into multiple lists, such as by project - which is nice.  It also has a sync to server features, which actually works well.  It has been reliable.  So far no problems - which is something I cannot say about any other TODO programs I have tried.  There is also a companion web based app you can access from any browser.  This is nice while at the desktop PC.  All in all, I really like this app.
B005AUWY90|3.0|Cars 2 is a fine movie. The visuals are stunning and the story is fun.    My biggest and really only disappointment with this blu-ray is that the disc is setup to default to a 16-bit 5.1 encoding of the audio track. So, if you have invested in the latest equipment, you must dive into the Languages menu to get 24-bit 7.1 audio. That's a huge bummer and likely the result of sloppy work over at Disney Home Video.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|The title says it all. It has all the classics and popular MJ Hits 2CD pack, a must have for everyones collection.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|Beautiful, inspirational, wacky, avante garde, often accessible, sometimes inaccessible, incredibly creative, like nothing you've ever heard, and even for a long-time Smile fanatic, there were endless sessions and material I had never heard before.  I feel I finally understand SMILE thoroughly, and I offer four basic conclusions:  1) Brian was not only way before his time, he was way before technology's time.  His modular approach to songwriting was an entirely new form of composition in pop music, and while he had SMILE in his head -- and probably multiple versions of SMILE in there at the same time -- the llimited technology of the day (small number of tracks on tape recorders, editing done by razor and tape, etc.) quite simply made his task IMPOSSIBLE.  That he was able to piece together \\"Good Vibrations,\\" \\"Cabinessence,\\" the released version of \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" and some other snippets is amazing enough.  But to have expected him to release a 50- to 60-minute album with literally thousands of musical fragments and overdubs all managing to hold together as a musical whole would have been beyond the capability of ANYBODY in the decades before computers, digital editing, and other technological advances.  Especially when all the time Capitol wanted more hit singles.  SMILE was not about hit singles -- it was about a brilliant conceptual whole unlike any recording ever made in history.    2) There was never a SMILE that Brian's 2004 version can be compared to.  It was a work-in-progress whose very nature allowed it to be shuffled and rearranged into an infinite variety of presentations.  Had Brian finished SMILE in 1967, that would have been just one possible version of his music. So regarding claims that the original differed from the 2004 rendition because the bass sounded different or the strings sounded different, or anything like that just doesn't hold water.  Not even cool, cool, water.  Why?  Because as a listen to the SMILE sessions reveals, Brian was changing sounds constantly.  There's no way to know what a 1967-released version would have even sounded like.  Brian might have totally redone \\"Wonderful\\" and \\"Wind Chimes\\" and other parts that listeners today think are \\"perfect,\\" and those might have been replaced by very different arrangements/performances.  It's obvious that SMILE was a living, breathing thing that hadn't coalesced into any kind of final presentation.  Had Brian released SMILE in 1967, you might be listening to the SMILE sessions now, but instead of loving them, you'd be feeling thankful that Brian didn't go with many of the takes and approaches you've loved all these years, simply because you would have already accepted some \\"other\\" version that had met Brian's approval at the time.   3) Because of #2 (above), Brian's 2004 rendition of SMILE is the ONLY legitimate version of SMILE.  And it's a five-star version, so put it on and enjoy it!  4) After steeping myself in the 1966-1967 fragments from this box-set and then revisiting the 2004 recording, I have come to the conclusion that anyone who thinks the 21st century version is a letdown is NUTS!  Brian's faithfulness to the sound of the original tracks, his compositions, and the melodic and structural flow is incredible down to the finest detail.  As glorious as I felt his 2004 version was when I first heard it, I now see it as even more of a masterwork.  Not only is it one of the most amazing albums ever released, the reconstruction that was done to keep it as faithful to the original also makes it one of the greatest re-recordings in history.  I hope this is the last word on SMILE.  Maybe soon Brian will revisit his modular songwriting approach and come up with some other brilliant works along those same lines.  He came close with \\"Rio Grande,\\" done many years after he was supposed to be all washed-up.    Buy the new archival release, listen to it, and appreciate the fact that Brian Wilson was probably not defeated by the drugs, or the arcanelyrics, or The Beach Boys, or anything else other than the fact that he chose to produce an epic of such detail and perfection that was beyond the ability of any living musician or engineer or producer on the planet at the time due to the scope of the project and the technological limitations within which he was forced to operate.  Brian was like a man with a single-lensed camera trying to film a 3-D movie.  It just wasn't going to be possible to complete a work of such incomparable brilliance and creativity given the music studio equipment of the 1960s.  Not without leaning dangerously close to insanity.  After all, \\"Good Vibrations\\" took six months or more all on its own.    I hope the legacy of this incredible release is that Brian attempted to touch the Sun, but NOBODY could have touched the Sun.  However, Brian probably got closer than anyone else in pop music history.
0446547654|5.0|The Best of Me is a very good book. Just like all of Nicholas Sparks book. Although I do argee with the change in his writting style it still is a very good book and I recommend it to others.
B005NPLXJ4|2.0|Clearly this is a Lou Reed album with Metallica providing back up album isn't that bad.  I like both artists but this collaboration I just don't know. It won't be enough to satisfy hardcore Tallica-fans but since I have no issues with Lou Reed I went in guns blazing.  Already to track 7 Frustration (how many Metallica fans feel i bet) decent song so just who does the album appeal to? Lou Reed or Metallica fans that's a tough call. The reason for the low rating I expected more from BOTH artists on this project but somehow falls short of epic or excellence.  Its worth a listen if you are a fan of either artist but this had always been Lou's project.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|For those who hate this album, it is time to re-evaluate what you like about Opeth. I love the tonal dichotomy of Opeth. Opeth is one of the few metal bands I listen to on account of their musicianship, and for this reason, I embraced the growls of yester-year on albums like Still Life and Black Water park, despite the fact that I was never into that kind of death metal...it fit the music and that stage of Akerfeldt's career. As each new album is released, some fans seem to forget that time has passed on some subconsious level. Remember that Mikael, while still young, is getting older and has an excellent voice...now why would he continue to strain his vocal cords each passing year and end his career prematurely? Growling like that stresses the vocal cords and is a sure-fire way to burn the pipes out fast. If he were a lousy singer as many metal band frontmen are, then I would say stick to growling. Peter Gabriel can still perform at over sixty years old and his voice sounds as good as it did during his Genesis debut(if not better). If Mikael takes care of himself and his voice, he can continue his work enthrall us for years to come.   Who wants to listen to a band that remains stagnant and never changes? I have access to all the classic Opeth albums with all the growls I will ever need. These albums are dear to me and I still listen to them frequently, but the artist must grow and explore new ways to express his creativity; it is beneficial to the music community at large. If you are listening to Opeth sheerly for the growling and head-banging, perhaps you never fully grasped what separates Opeth from the common death metal clay. If this is the case, you should stop following them for pursuit of a pure death metal band - there are enough to choose from. This album has a bit of a learning curve for appreciation since it marks a clear divergence from the band's previous releases. I would urge any true fan who listened once and banished this album to attempt to listenat least a few more times before casting it away never looking back.  Although some argue this album parallels Damnation due to the lack of heaviness, this album is worlds apart from Damnation. Damnation seems to maintain the same essence of Deliverance and Ghost Reveries...it seems to be a logical fit on the discographic timeline. Hertiage is markedly different with respect to Watershed (as well as all the previous releases in my opinion).    As much as I love the older Opeth albums, I think I must say this is Mikael's finest work to date and he deserves unadulterated respect from his fan-base and the music community at large for this album - it is both brilliant and unique. So, if you want quality music that evolves, giving a fresh perspective on 70s progressive rock with hints of metal flare, jazz and that signature Opeth ambiance, stay tuned. The dynamics of this album are superb and I expect nothing less from the next one. For now, all I can do is wait for the next release with a salavating palate and enjoy Heritage. I am extremely happy I have this album for the vinyl collection!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|THIS DOCUMENTARY  REALLY SHOWS THINGS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW. IT IS A MUST WATCH FOR EVERY PERSON LIVING IN AMERICA. IT SHOULD BE PART OF OUR SCHOOL'S CURRICULUM.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|The Beatles were one of the best bands around back then and still are today. It's essential and most of the songs are good but it's extremely overrated. I'd pick Revolver or Abbey Road over this any day. It was very unique for the time, that's why it's more popular. Some people don't like The Beatles because they think they're overrated. Their music is popular for a reason and most of their music's good, even their most overrated. It's not the very best though, their music before Sgt. Pepper doesn't get as much attention. Rubber Soul and Revolver are amazing, those are five star albums. Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home, A Day In the Life, When I'm Sixty Four and Sgt. Pepper are the best and are great songs however Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and With A Little Help From My Friends are overrated in my opinion. After all this was one of the first albums in psychedelic rock and it popularized the genre but now it sounds outdated in parts. Revolver holds up with age much better.
0446547654|1.0|Very disappointed reader    It was a predictable book with a stretchy plot. I saw Mr. Sparks giving an interview on TV saying that he does not considered himself a romance writer because his books do not have happy endings. Well ...he can call himself whatever he wants, but he will have to improve his writing to keep his readers loyal to his work.
B0014DC0AK|5.0|Death metal has so many other genres and sub-genres but Death were the first band to actually scream instead of sing. Everyone tries to do that today but this is more original and one of the best in that genre. You don't need metalcore, screamo, emocore, deathcore or mallcore when you have Death, this is actually good music and it's a real metal classic. They were original and started death metal, they sounded original for the time. Chuck Schuldiner influenced a lot of musicians today that we wouldn't have if it wasn't for Death creating a new genre. Symbolic's my favorite Death CD but they have other good ones.
0060555661|5.0|I has learned after reading just 1 chapter in dis book, lots more than I has learned from talkin to investors and the lot.   Dis book be made by a well clever man who know the deal wit da street.  I now be an investa, not a speculata
B000002KDO|5.0|MOR is one of Black Sabbath's finest moments. It isn't as popular as Paranoid but it's better in my opinion, personally I think that album's a little overrated. Master of Reality is heavier and darker than their first 2 and it was the heaviest metal album at the time. They changed direction on MOR and the band started to evolve and experiment with their music more. It has their hit, Sweet Leaf which you're probably familiar with. Overall, MOR is a classic and one of the greatest albums ever made.
B004W4N55C|3.0|8bucks for the app?  I think that's ridiculous! All it really does is grab the tabs from the website and give you a metronome.  If it wasn't free I wouldn't have got it.  If you have no qualms paying this much then go for it...  otherwise,  go get one off of 4shared.
B000002OPP|5.0|Jimi Hendrix influenced a lot of rock music around today. This is his best album out of the 3. It isn't as hard rock as Are You Experienced?, it's more experimental and has all kinds of genres in it. This is real, quality classic rock and one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's in my top 40 albums of all time. Jimi Hendrix is a legend and without him, we wouldn't have the rock bands we have today. House Burning Down's my personal favorite but it has several good songs.
B004LWZVZM|3.0|Yet another movie with a great premise and an interesting setting that succumbs to self-inflicted wounds.<br /><br />My unease started early in the movie when it began to feel like an episode of Law and Order. The movie seems as if it were made in a hurry, and at times feels like an elaborate school play. The scenery and cinematography were the highlight of this movie, but unfortunately they are so good they only amplify the awkwardness of the actors.<br /><br />The actors and their dialogue were, at times, completely out of step with the characters, the times, and the events they were portraying, and as a result The Conspirator suffers from an utter lack of gravitas.  The men appear as modern day frat boys pretending to be historical figures. Robin Wright and the daughter gave the best performances, but that is little help or consolation for this movie.<br /><br />I was excited about this move but, as you can tell, I was ultimately disappointed. The premise is fantastic, and the movie (and McAvoy's performance) does get some traction near the end, but by and large this is a lackluster movie, with unconvincing characters, undone by a screenplay that is far too \\"Hollywood\\" for the subject matter.
B000063DFS|5.0|Ozzy's solo career went downhill after Randy Rhoades died. Jake E Lee was great on Bark at the Moon but that Ultimate Sin came and everything went downhill. Zack Wylde replaced him and No Rest for the Wicked was an improvement but it wasn't exactly a classic. This is an improvement and it's his best album since Disary of a Madman. No More Tears will always remain a classic from when it came out to this day. It's more diverse than the rest of his albums, it's not as heavy but it's still a metal album and it has several ballads like the title track No More Tears and Mama I'm Coming Come. There's so many popular hits including those 2 songs and I Don't Wanna Change the World, Mr. Tinkertrain, Hellraiser, Time After Time and Road to Nowhere. It's almost like a greatest hits album. No More Tears has all of his best songs and the production is great.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|great game.... more challenging than angry birds but every bit as fun. I don't seem to lose hours of the day to this one but still worth every penny.
B000002KB8|5.0|Before this, there wasn't any metal. This is where it all started. It has so many great songs like The Wizard, Behind the Wall of Sleep and my personal favorite Wicked World. Several songs have a lot of blues in them. It doesn't show as much on their later stuff, very little on Paranoid and none on Master of Reality. Every metal band around today was somewhat influenced by Black Sabbath. I'd put this album in their top 5 best. They didn't get as much attention until Paranoid but this is better in my opinion.
B004W4N55C|5.0|Thanks to both the dev and Amazon for a really great app. I love the intuitive interface, the huge selection of tabs, and the useful tools. Until now I haven't experienced tablet envy, but the larger screen would be nice sitting a couple of feet away while holding a guitar. No complaints, though. This is a substantial giveaway. Thanks again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Downloaded it to my Kindle and could not stop reading. Very well written, fast paced, intriguing, frightening,  innocent?. The imagination catches you and does not let you go. History has shown us real monsters as leaders of the world in different eras, who know what the future will bring. Frightening! I read all 3 books in the trilogy with gusto, unfortunately it had to end. Its one of those books you know you will miss when you finish it. Spoiler alert on the ending. Although after thinking about it the ending was need like it did I guess. However it did leave me wanting more, much more from Katniss, maybe that was the intention. Thank you Ms Collins.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Great service, arrived timely and was exactly what we ordered. I would recommend this product and business to anyone. I was very satisfied.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great series, pity it's not on in Australia.  Not happy about the price plummeting 4 weeks after I bought my copy....
B0053YGYO4|2.0|I've been a Coldplay fan for years, owning all of their albums but Parachutes, but this doesn't work.  When I first heard Every Tear Drop is a Waterfall, I understood it was a new direction, but I liked that and thought they would pull it off well.  Nope, they screwed it up so badly its almost laughable.    First of all, whats with all the synthesizers?  Whatever happened to them using a classical piano?  This feels so out of place with the rest of their albums.  The production value is AWFUL.  The first time I heard it was in the car, and it BLASTED.  The drum beat is distorted getting rid of the Coldplay feeling.    It has too much pop in it.  That's all it sounds like, and it sounds bad.  I am INCREDIBLY disappointed by this album. I was expecting something pretty and quiet, like Viva La Vida perfectly delivered.  This sounds awful.  The Good:  Every Tear Drop is a Waterfall  The Bad:  Everything else
B001KMB6VE|4.0|This is not Vin's best futuristic action film (see the two RIDDICK films), but it is worth viewing.  I have watched it 3 times since buying -- each time I see something additional.  The story is a little muddled, but entertaining on a rainy Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.
1451648537|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Apple's products and religiously follow everything they do - from their technological innovations to their unparalleled marketing savvy, so I was excited to read this book. It's a compelling, fantastic read. I learned so much about what went on behind the scenes at Apple, and gained a greater understanding of how Jobs' brilliance transformed so many industries and made Apple the most valuable tech company (if not simply the most valuable company) in America. The book is a fast-paced, heavily researched, insightful and totally fun and, once finished, I felt I understood more about this complex, gifted man than I ever had before. Well worth it.
B0037A4ILC|3.0|I think this film needed to be seen in a theater.  It literally loses it's depth of excitement on a small screen at home.  The photography would have been fantastic and scared the hell out of the viewer in 3-D.  The story line is somewhat factual, but not very compelling.  What is most interesting is that these German climbers were climbers first, Germans second, and never Nazis.  Even the pro-Nazi newspaper man is a newspaper man first, and political dunce second.  What the film clearly illustrates is that climbers of this caliber go beyond the term \\"fearless\\" -- they deliberately face death where life depends on a small ice pick not coming loose on an upper ledge, while the rocks of a 1000 foot cliff give way beneath their boots -- all for the pride of having conquered the North Face of the Eiger.  It is the type of film you'll watch maybe every 3 or 4 years, just for the Eiger photography.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This story line is beautiful, it makes you appreciate and aware of the bond between human and animal. Don't under estimate them, they are smarter then you think. Yes I am an animal lover, but i think anyone can appreciate this movie.....its a tearjerker for sure, you have been warned break out the tissues ladies!!
B003Y5H574|4.0|This is a tad crazy movie, but not stupid on the subject of love.  It highlights the stupid things we'll do for love, and this is part of its charm.  We can all relate and connect as we've done these things, or worse.  Who hasn't been a fool for love?  It examines the nature of love through a number of relationships.  What it is, and what it isn't.    Steve Carrell plays his amusing goofball, clueless dad self.  Ryan Gossling ignites every scene he's in, and is illuminating as the slick romancinator/seducer until he falls for love. Emma Stone is great counterpoint and foil to Gossling's slickness and gives a textured performance.  The movie will connect with several generations as it shows love in some of its timeless guises.  If you want to be entertained by a little craziness and stupidity in the name of love, you may want to see this movie.
B000F8O35U|4.0|There was not much info from the seller but I purchased it along with a Cinderella movie.  The DVD looked scratched so I watch it to make sure it worked.  It works fine.  The cover was a bit damaged but the DVD was the most important thing.  It's a Christmas gift for my daughter and boy will she be surprised.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Not only is this a great second album by a true \\"supergroup\\" but the packaging of the vinyl edition is awesome. I have not seen the disc version but the 3-D effect of the vinyl edition is some of the best I have seen and the booklet,Gatefold and sleeves all are cool as helll. If you like the first album I recommend this as it may be a little more mature but still plenty of excellent guitar work from Satch. I saw them live in 2009 and am glad they stuck together because they were jaw dropping and this album does not disappoint.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This was a great purchase!  The video and cover are In perfect condition.  It was delivered quickly, hardly a wait.  This is my favorite Disney movie and now our daughter enjoys watching it, she loves it!
B005KAH7QU|1.0|The preview was way more interesting than the movie. It's art nouveau meets bad music video meets cartoon chases set to music all with bizarre characters, none of which you care about. There is no building of the characters nor did the plot and historical flashbacks truly offer any substance. Save your money.
1878424939|2.0|Reviewing a \\"self'-help\\" book has less to do with the literary talent, and more with the advice. This book gets 2 stars not because it's written poorly, but because it misses what I feel is an essential part of existence: sharing life with others. Ruiz makes certain good points--the books focuses on independence and personal freedom, and goes about achieving this by saying that external factors outside of yourself don't matter. This philosophy can be useful to create emotional self-governing, but Ruiz's method feels narrow-minded and isolation-forming. At one point he says, \\"Whatever you think, whatever you feel, I know it's your problem and not my problem. It's the way you see the world. It's nothing personal.\\" That is the outlook he suggests we develop.<br /><br />The goal (I think) Ruiz shoots for here is to strengthen our inner beliefs and listen less to societal/cultural beliefs & practices that can be harmful, arbitrary, and impersonal. The philosophical idea is fair enough, but in today's world, we can't just close ourselves off from all people and society. The books fails to understand that human beings exist in relation to other human beings. By having an attitude that says, \\"Whatever you think, it's your problem,\\" we're not opening up communication in any way, and that's not a sustainable approach for personal or professional relationships. The book is a good start, but it needs to add a component with how to integrate these ideas with the emotional relationship we have to people and the world around us.
B0000256VK|1.0|Strange.  I bought this from Amazon(sold by Noram International Partners, Inc.). Although all labeling and graphics on both the case and disc indicate Roxy Music Avalon, the disc actually contains 20 tracks of Mexican mariachi music.  There is no Roxy Music on it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The wait is over!!! Star Wars episodes 1 thru 6 (The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi)are now on the Blu-ray format, and look even better than ever, with superior DTS 6.1 audio and video. I know George Lucas made even more changes (Vader screaming NOOOOO as the Emperor attacks Luke with his Force lightning in JEDI (!), lol. But still, this is what the Blu-ray format was made for, and it IS Star Wars, after all (although it hurts me too that Lucas wont acknowledge the original trilogy in their original forms and shouldve included them in this set). Well, what can you do, right? Enjoy.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This film resonated with me for several reasons.  First, because  I am a 3rd Generation Japanese-American and visibly recognizable as  an 'Asian', with the resultant consequences in American society.  Secondly, because the film was shot in the greater Detroit area and  I was born and raised in Detroit.  Finally, because I have been BOTH characters shown in the film.  I was the clueless, withdrawn and shy Asian teenager and  after retiring from the Detroit PD after 25 years of street patrol service, I  have become the grumpy, conservative old man.  I see some of the reviewers who gave the film only 1 or 2 stars, have missed the point of the film completely and for entirely opposite reasons. I saw the words, 'depressing, 'dark', and 'sad' used by some of those reviewers.  Welcome to the life of an Asian in America.  The young Asian guy in the film may have appeared 'wooden' but he was a fairly accurate depiction of what I was like at that age.  And no, I was never gang-raped by any group of racist cowards. The racial antipathy of some of the negative reviewers towards Asians, is pretty transparent to me.  Some people will never confront nor admit their own level of racism toward all Asian people.  Hollywood has contributed greatly to decades of depicting us as the traditional enemy of White civilization.  So it is good that a Hollywood film has done something significant to counter-balance that propaganda.  The film 'Letters From Iwo Jima' was another contribution Mr. Eastwood has made toward better understanding of the other guy's point of view.  Perhaps Mr. Eastwood's marriage to a woman with a percentage of Japanese ancestry has made him more acutely aware of the insane degree of racist antipathy toward all Asians, which is held by millions of folks in this great country?  When I recommended viewing of 'Letters' to some of my friends, who are WWII buffs, to my surprise, they refused to even watch the film, because anti Japanese sentiment is still so pervasive, thatthey have no interest in even considering the perspective of these former enemies.  Discovering that about my 'friends' was an eye-opener for me.  Now I want to close this review by stating the 'real' reason why Gran Torino was snubbed at the Oscars.  It had nothing to do with the racial slurs made against Asians.  It was in fact because there were no black characters in the film with any socially-redeeming qualities and the only ones shown were despicable street gang members, who were addressed by Waly Kowalski with racist slurs comparable to those he used when addressing the Asians in the film.  Here's where the big double-standard comes in.  It is acceptable to laugh about the Gook, slant, slope, Dragon-lady insults, but the Academy wouldn't DARE endorse any film which contains any anti-black language or messages. That is sacrosanct, Holy ground, upon which no public media is allowed to tread.    There are minorities in the USA and then there are Untouchable Minorities.  Tell me I'm wrong.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Although perhaps not as great as the original, 2009s IronMan 2 does have its moments (Whiplash attacking Tony Stark during the racing event in Monaco, the fight between War Machine and IronMan). Robert Downey Jr is back, and brings even more depth and playful mischief to his characterization of Stark/IronMan, and some pathos too as he realizes that the chest plate he wears to save his life is slowly killing him and must find a new element to save his life or else. Mickey Rourke is cast as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash and makes a formidable villian, and Don Cheadle is here as James Rhodes/War Machine, and I must say hes even better than Terrance Howard from the first movie, who virtually had nothing to do but stand around and look annoyed as he tried to rein our hero in, lol. A fun adventure.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I have always enjoyed John Grisham novels.  So when possible I pre-ordered this book.  I was so ready for another good story by John.  As I started the book I found that I disliked all the main characters.  None of them had character traits that I liked or could relate to.  It was almost as though Grisham went out of his way to produce characters that we would dislike.<br /><br />The story starts with David Zinc having an employment breakdown.  As he makes his way to his large firm in downtown Chicago for another 14 hour day of \\"slave labor,\\" if you can call it that at $300,000.00 salary a year, David can't take it anymore.  He dives back into the elevator, flees the building and spends the day getting drunk in a local bar (not his normal routine).<br /><br />At the end of the day he stumbles out of the bar into a cab and is taken to the law offices of Finley & Figg in the not so good part of town.  He drunkenly stumbles into their office and before you know it he has a new job as am ambulance chasing lawyer for a small boutique firm.<br /><br />The other two lawyers, Finley and Figg are not the hero's that you want them to be.  They instead are the bottom of the barrel lawyers who lie, cheat and pay off clients to sign up with them.  They offer quickie divorces, DUI hearings and anything else they can drum up.<br /><br />So, the book starts off slow.  I write these reviews as a hobby and I have to tell you that I didn't even want to finish the book.  At 1/3rd of the way through I set it down and read David Balacci's new book instead.  I then came back and forced myself to read more because I can't review what I don't read.<br /><br />Well, I have to tell you, after all the bad feelings I had I found myself at about 75% of the way through the book and wanting to know how it was going to end.  The lawyers had become part of a mass tort lawsuit regarding a new drug.  But when everyone else dropped out because it appeared to have no merit they were forced to go to Federal Court and try the only case that was going to go to trial.  None of the three had ever been in Federal Court.  None had ever tried a case like this.  So, what was going to happen.<br /><br />Maybe I was reading because I just wanted to see them get their heads handed to them in a bad trial.<br /><br />But at 85% of the way through the book it finally picks up steam and the real thrill starts to happen.  Down to their last ace in the hole (the novel lawyer, David) the trial enters it's last phase.  Just when it looked like there was no hope David finds a small opening in the defense attorney's strategy and turns on the heat.  What will happen?  Well, you have to read it to find out.<br /><br />By the end of the novel I was again liking John Grisham.  I still didn't particularly like the three lawyers, but I was warming up to one of them and enjoyed the book completely.<br /><br />So, while at first I wouldn't have given it two stars an a favorable review I ended up giving it 4 stars and enjoying the book.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it was well.to go to trial.

B004EPYZXK|4.0|This review contains the spoiler of telling you why they went to the moon, but not the ending.<br /><br />The reason why no one knew about this mission was because it was top secret. 2 astronauts land on the moon near its south pole. The movie cleverly combines actual film footage of NASA with their own track over and their own film. They were careful enough to use side lighting to create the long shadows seen in the NASA films. I appreciate it when they do their homework. The cameras have been put in place. This avoids much of that sea sick motion you get from the other reality (translate:cheap) type movies.<br /><br />Now the reason why they really went there was to check on the Russians who have landed a LEM (looks like a diving bell) on the moon. The crew was not informed about this so they really panicked when they found another set of footprints. What we know:<br /><br />1)The Russian is dead, apparently killed.<br />2) There is a strange rock that seems to move on its own, but we don't see it move.<br />3) There is a strange crater/shaft made from different rock which is at the heart of the problem.<br />4) There are communication issues and there appears to be strange going-ons outside the LEM that suggests visitors.<br /><br />Now I hate hand held reality movies. My finger is on the fast forward button more than a lab rat pressing for cheese. But this one held my interest. I wanted to see what was causing all the grief, even if it was just for a fleeting moment and later they did resort to the herky-jerky camera. I was too far along at the time. I wonder how this lines up with \\"The Dark Side of the Moon?\\"
B003OA6AOI|4.0|This episode presents real characters faced with daunting moral dilemmas in situations without any real positive solutions. It lays the groundwork for Captain Jack as a military man as well as the rogue he's been made out to be thus far and forces all of the team members to make hard choices. I also think that given these difficult choices and the characters conflicting motivations, the acting isn't bad. The cast members don't play the extreme melodramatic parts that this episode could have devolved toward, and they really seem to struggle to come to their decisions and to stick with them. There are a couple instances where the actions taken are a little too convenient to the plot line, but I think it showcases the characters in a way that the episodes before this one do not.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I should probably start off by mentioning that I have never read any comic books related to Captain America, so I had no prior knowledge about the characters in the movie. I honestly didn't really know whether I'd like the movie or not when I bought it. I usually like watching movies based on comic book superheroes, even if I haven't read the comic books beforehand. I guess I just like the idea of watching comic book characters come to life in these types of movies. Sometimes, I decide to check on this site to see what the average rating is for a movie before buying it. In this case, I decided to get it on a whim instead. After having seen it, I have to say that I definitely enjoyed watching it for the most part. Due to the fact that I hadn't read any Captain America comic books prior to seeing the movie, the ending definitely surprised me more than a little bit. Chris Evans did a pretty good job in his role as Captain America. I remembered him from when he was in the Fantastic Four movies a few years ago. Hugo Weaving was convincing as the evil villain of the movie. When the villain of a movie can get an audience member to want to see them vanquished by the good guy, it means that the actor is doing his job, and doing it well. This movie left me wanting to know what will happen next in the story because of what happened at the end. I don't say that about every movie. Then again, not every movie I watch has an ending to it that leaves room for a sequel. Suffice to say that if you are looking for a good action movie that can hold your attention and doesn't have a huge amount of gore (there is a little, but not very much), look no further than this movie.

B005HPA2XI|5.0|I think my review title says it all.  When I first bought this album and gave it a spin, I was a little disappointed and maybe a touch confused, but now I \\"get it\\".  Some reviews have claimed this album is too different from their previous works.  While I agree that it is different, this definitely strikes me as Mastodon.  No other band sounds like this except maybe Baroness or similar bands that spawned in Mastodon's wake.  Anyway, I have to admit that this CD took a while to grow on me.  I think the reason for this is because the CD is not as focused as their previous releases; there is a lot of diversity on this album and not being a concept album makes it seem a little all over the place.  But, at the same time, this is what makes the album interesting and compelling.  Mastodon is definitely having fun on this album.  As far as styles and themes, the album is pretty much all over the place.  At first, this was a little alarming, but I am enjoying it after repeated listens I have to say.<br /><br />As far as the specifics of the album, there are hints of all different Mastodon styles on this album.  For example, \\"The Black Tongue\\" reminds me a lot of Mastodon's style on \\"Blood Mountain\\"; \\"Spectrelight\\" reminds me of their style on \\"Remission\\" or \\"Leviathan\\"; and, \\"Stargasm\\" gives me a taste of \\"Crack the Skye\\".  Then, there are other songs on here that don't sound like anything I've really heard from Mastodon before such as \\"The Sparrow\\".  I am hearing a lot of classic rock influences in these songs such as Zepplin, Floyd, etc...  Still, this album has something to like for everybody.  Honestly, there are some songs I really really love on this album and I feel that you will too if you give it a chance.<br /><br />I think it needs mentioned that the one thing that stands out on this album is Dailor's amazing drums.  His drum work on this album is absolutely killer!  I haven't heard drum work like this since Leviathan, which was equally amazing.  Really, Dailor is one of metal's greatest drummers and this album shows that.  Of course, the other instruments and the vocals are also awesome and the choruses are memorable and emotional.<br /><br />If you are a Mastodon fan, this album is still a mandatory purchase.  Others may or may not like this album depending on your perspective.  If you are into classic rock or progressive metal, you will probably dig this.  If you are into the harder stuff, you may dig this if you have an open mind.  But, honestly, I really love this CD.  While it is not my favorite Mastodon work, I think it is a great CD with a lot to offer a lot of people.  Give it a chance and you may feel the same way!test drummers and this album shows that.

B002NOAF9W|1.0|I would not mind getting the Tina Turner, BB King stuff and the bonus tracks. This is the way Mick originally wanted it released, but the record co. rejected the idea. However, why stick the DVD in there with only 4 tracks? - the BONUS tracks no less! Are we to believe the whole show does not exist on video? Why not just release the audio and release the complete DVD separetely? It would be interesting to see the video of the audio we have known and loved all these years, but noooo...they give us the 4 tracks only. This makes no sense...

B005FVFWOI|5.0|I am glad to see for once they did not stick the DVD and surround disk (or whatever it is this time) down people's throats who do not want it. Let's see how these people who want that stuff now are forced to buy a big huge box just to get it. How do you like it? I hate listening to people talk about how great everything sounds on their computer. I hate computers. I hate the idea of listening to audio on a DVD. Now, if we can only get the guy who mastered this to FIX those King Crimson issues!!!!!!!

B001UV4XJ2|2.0|Love the movie and understand that they may be putting the movies in the vault.  Soon all of the films may be unavailable.  I will NOT waste my money buying this from Amazon or anywhere else, if only the UltraViolet edition is available.  I'm not paying $24-$25 for just the Blu-Ray and DVD.  I've known of too many issues with UltraViolet downloads.  The last movie purchased, during each attempted download, it stated that they were experiencing technical difficulties from the site (and the download was unavailable).  Money down the drain.

B00271CGCA|3.0|Cars, chicks, explosions, inmates, death-defying situations and a warden who knows what it takes to make a fortune.  That line pretty much sums up the movie -- which isn't to say that it is bad, just exactly what you'd expect the movie to be based on the cover image and name :)

0375842209|5.0|What a story.  Sometimes a book is more than a book, more than a story, it's a friend.  The humanness of the characters and the intimacy of the story get inside you and live there-they become part of you.  The Book Thief is such a book for me.  I finished it the other day and I can't get it out of my mind.  The writing is phenomenal, brilliant; the story is so beautiful.  I'm so grateful I had the experience of reading this book and honestly, I miss it.  I don't want to read anything else for awhile because it feels like a betrayal.  I'm actually grieving the fact that I've finished this book.  Thank you Markus Zusak for sharing your gift with me.
B005J29HCQ|3.0|After listening to this masterpiece, I found myself LONGING to hear it in stereo, where it can properly breathe and expand into the outer dimensions, as it was intended to do. But at last, all we have is this mono version. Big disappointment, cause this music demands to be heard in wide-open stereo! As others have stated in their reviews, I suppose we'll get yet another release in 5 years that will have the stereo version. If we learned anything from the stereo release of Pet Sounds, it was that the stereo versions of those songs were not only possible, but actually sounded better than their mono counterparts. So, while I whole-heartedly agree with all of the superlatives heaped on this ground-breaking master-piece, I cannot give it 5 stars because of my complete disappointment at their being no stereo mix included in this package. God only knows how amazing Good vibrations would have sounded in stereo.......and we'll just have to keep on longing.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I've never done this before.  That is, write a review of an album I do not like.  Also I know everyone is going to jump down my throat about this, I did not waste my money and buy it, I only listened to it on the Lulu / Metallica website -- something else I've never written about based on.  To put things in context, I'm 57 and a fan of Metallica and the Velvet Underground (Lou Reed's '60 band).  I read some of the \\"good, five-star\\" reviews.  I just don't get it.  And I'm a fairly astute fan of a lot of different types of music, classic rock, metal, blues, jazz, folk, world, classical, hundreds of bands and artists.  But Lulu as high art?  As a Metallica album it is fairly monotonous and repetitive sounding.  For the younger people on this page, at one time Lou Reed was a pretty good singer and a great song writer.  The Velvet Underground was a very innovative band.  They had a female drummer in, what was it, 1967.  Her name was Maureen \\"Mo\\" Tucker.  They used feedback, strange tunings and modes, even detuned instruments, and often hypnotic droning riffs and rhythms.  Like say the Doors, they were one of a kind.  The VU has influenced many other bands.  These include R.E.M., Sonic Youth, and the Smashing Pumpkins.  Lou Reed also had many solo hit songs.  One has become an everyday (cliché) expression, \\"Take A Walk On The Wild Side.\\"  So Lou Reed's gender bending as Lulu's voice is not new to him.  On most other material I like Lou Reed's singing, but here he is not really singing but chanting or better yet reciting.  Also his voice may be shot.  If he rapped it might have been at least more modern.    VU and Lou Reed were part of the psychedelic proto-punk art-rock sound of NYC.  They lead more or less to say the Talking Heads and New York Dolls, than say anything heavy metal.  I feel Deep Purple and Black Sabbath spawned most heavy metal.  Many of the other reviewers on here have done a great job of explaining what may be great or horrible about this album.  And how each song sounds.  I won't add to that.  But what I heard sounded like a bad matching of talents.  Lou Reed might have done better recording with Pearl Jam or The Red Hot Chili Peppers for a \\"different\\" sound.  Or with Sonic Youth or Billy Corgan for a more Velvet Underground sounding album.  Just think, this could have been worse.  Imagine Lou with Ozzy!  But Metallica, really?  Some of the titles and comments by others about this release are just great, some are funny as hell, probably more entertaining than the album itself.  Should I give Lulu another (full) chance?  Feel free to cast a vote in a Comment.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|This is a $49.99 3-disk Blu-Ray package.  Owning over 1200 DVDS and having successfully ordered other digital packages, I expect SUPREME quality, heirloom quality.  Not with this package.  All three disks have problems.  We started watching the first disk on Friday night, no sound.  Put our cleaning disk in the Blu-Ray player, tried again, no sound.  Cleaned the disk with Windex, no sound.  Cleaned with Windex again, it played but it got \\"stuck\\" at a couple of places that we had to skip around to finish the movie.  Second disk had no sound problems but \\"stuck\\" at 11410 and spent about 30 minutes trying to get around this issue, by cleaning the disk, reloading the disk, etc.  You starting to see a pattern?  Third disk we just finished and I am totally pissed.  Bad sound and from 4510 to 5607 had to skip this section.  Further toward the end, same issue.  These are supposedly NEW disks, but they act as if they are used.  Again, we watch 4-5 movies every week, own three DVD players, one Blu-Ray.  Occasionally we have a bad disk.    I want a full refund.  I will take a replacement, but I don't want it, don't want anything from this vendor again.  One disk is bad enough, three defective disks tells me this is a vendor issue.  Amazon or whomever:  send me a full refund asap.

If you expect a new Metallica, thats not your stuff!!! However, if you are waiting for a new record and a new face of Lou Reed you SHOULD give give this CD a chance (maybe you should also like Berlin and Magic and Loss to appreciate this one). I did not like Raven (too much talk not enough music). I hope  to listen to more more new Lou Reeds records. I hope that they will be at least as good as this. Beautiful cold and noisy music!!!

B004EPZ020|1.0|\\"Paranormal Activity 3' is the funniest movie you will see in theaters all year. From start to finish it is loaded with gut busting laughs that you will be eager to tell you friends about. The problem? It's not a comedy...at all. In fact it is deadly seriously from beginning to end which only added to the fun. Once in a full moon horror audiences get to experience this sort of bad filmmaking. A film that plummets below mediocre into so-bad-it's-good territory. This is just that film.<br /><br />\\"Paranormal Activity 3' begins in 2005, Katie delivers a box of old videotapes to her pregnant sister, Kristi, and Kristi's husband, Daniel. A year later, Kristi and Daniel's house is seemingly burgled and the tapes are missing. Flashback to 1988, a young Katie and Kristi live with their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis; Kristi begins interacting with an invisible friend named Toby. Dennis notices that since Kristi's friend appeared, strange things have been happening in the house. Dennis and Julie try to make a sex tape, but are interrupted by an earthquake. While they look for the girls, the camera shows dust fall from the ceiling and land onto an invisible figure in the room. The figure then moves and the dust falls to the floor.<br />While reviewing the footage later, Dennis notices the strange incident. He invites his friend Randy over to view the footage, who suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house to capture any other incidents.<br /><br />That night in the girls' bedroom, Kristi wakes up and begins talking to someone off-camera before going back to bed. When Dennis questions her about this the following day, Kristi tells him that it is Toby. After more disturbed nights and strange occurrences, Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet. He finds the same symbol on a picture of women in a book about demonology. Dennis explains to Julie that the symbol belonged to a witches' coven that brainwashed girls of child-bearing age into having sons and then forgetting about it, but Julie dismisses his claim. Because, of course, he HAS to be making this all up. Right?<br /><br />Hmmm...where to start with the problems of this film:<br /><br />* Sometimes there is a time stamp on the camera, sometimes there isn't.<br />* Who is editing the jump cuts when there is no \\"flash forward\\" in time?<br />* Who was changing the tapes in the middle of the night?<br />* Why is the camera looking over at the parents bed when it is staring straight at the mirror?<br />* Why didn't the babysitter say what had happened to her to the parents?<br />* Why didn't the Randy show them his cut after he was attacked by \\"Toby\\"?<br />* Why was Toby never mentioned in the first two installments?<br />* Why didn't Dennis show Julie the tapes before going into the stupid speech about the witches?<br />* Was the final scene (witches in black robes?) really meant to be taken seriously?<br />* Didn't the video quality appear to be awfully good (and in HD even!!) for something that had been 25 years old and sitting in storage?<br />* Also did the witches edit the tapes together themselves?<br /><br />The list goes on and on and on. This is quite the movie experience that really must be seen to be believed. Go in with a few beers and zero thoughts in your head and maybe you'll have a good time. Who knows? Just don't spend money on it...ng about it, but Julie dismisses his claim. Because, of course, he HAS to be making this all up. Right?

That's cool for the average (technologically ignorant) reader, but appears incredibly dumb and unrealistic to someone who knows what a botnet is. Stuff like:\\"I just ran a decrypter, which is an application that makes encrypted files readable, and discovered a rootkit, which is a piece of software that...\\" Ridiculous!  Then there are mistakes that someone like Russinovich shouldn't make. For instance, it says that antivirus products update once a day and that most users don't even bother updating them. Seriously? What is this, 1999? Every single major antivirus updates at least twice a day, usually every 2 hours or so. Automatic updating is no new invention.  And as far as the plot goes. Seriously. Not one but TWO hot IT chicks, a terrorist plot and...I don't know, it just got more and more boring. I stopped reading at about 80% (Kindle version).   Definitely NOT recommended for the tech-savvy.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|Just because I'm living in such stupid country as Serbia is,I had to wait three months to receive this album. Three times this package didn't even come in Kraljevo, and I received message that I don't wanna buy that. It was ridicules, but now I have this CD in my hands and I'm very happy. First, because finally I have chance to listen all that great songs I heard only on some TV shows where Mr Laurie was guest. Second, because I really liked that songs then and I like them now more. I have read some comments where some people wrote that some songs sounds funny when Mr Laurie plays them. Honestly, most of this songs I don't know in \\"original package\\", but I am punk rock musician and that I am really enjoying in listening this blues songs means more than that stories about is melody better now or then. From \\"St.James Infirmary\\" to \\"Let them talk\\" there is none bad moment.This CD is something you can listen at morning, at afternoon, when you write something, when you walk around,in your car... Anytime,anyplace, and that's one more reason to buy this edition and to really enjoy.  Cheers!!!
0670022950|5.0|This Harvard Cognitive Scientist, who has written extensively and successfully on many complicated scientific issues, has concluded here that our violent world is getting better, owing primarily to improvements in several socio-economic, evolutionary and political factors. Foremost among them being that the frequency of wars has decreased rather dramatically. But also, and most importantly, due to the fact that institutional slavery has virtually been eliminated from the world; women have been empowered and are respected more; domestic violence is no longer openly condoned and many nations now have strict laws against it. Plus, worldwide poverty is decreasing and education is increasing, especially for women. Even ethnic and racial violence is on the decline, as are common prejudices against ostracized members of society, although some resistant pockets throughout the civilized world still remain. Another part of the author's good news is that corporal punishment of children is no loner an acceptable practice; and due to contraceptives, fewer unwanted children (who have traditionally been the victims of violence, exploitation and oppression) are being produced. I think we can also add to the author's good news a factor that he shares with Professor Rudolph Rummel. They both conclude that on the whole democratic countries are less belligerent and almost never go to war against each other. And since, at least since the end of WW-II there has been a dramatic increase in the number of democratic societies. This fact too would suggest that the world is becoming less and less violent.<br /><br />This is all very good news indeed, but the good news and the author's fine research, which takes a taxonomic approach in which he groups the causes of violence into discrete categories that in themselves could be the cause of much controversy, does not make this topic any easier. Nor does it make it any easier to review this book. Reviewing it is a complicated proposition because the book covers so much contested and controversial ground, and touches on so many complex theories whose details require in-depth investigations just to draw even tentative or minimal conclusions. That said however, it must also be said that this author has done a Yeoman's job in marshaling the resources to continue a process and a tradition that many eminent scholars have made important contributions to over the last several decades.  Some of those scholars will be mentioned in this brief review.<br /><br />However, before getting into the views of others, it is fair to say that the author has taken a primarily psycho-evolutionary approach to the causes of violence and to its solutions. But in my view, what has resulted is a kind of a scattershot approach. Motivations for violence and the controls to inhibit it are seen here as deriving from the same point, the human will. Or as he puts it metaphorically, to the better angels of our (collective) human nature.<br /><br />Somehow, the metaphor is stretched much too thinly to cover all the ground required by this humongous research project. And while it is true as the author has suggested that man seems to be evolving for the better, I recall that during the discussions of the decision to use the Atomic bomb, there was always the distinct feeling lurking in the background (that was later confirmed by actual use of the bomb on Japan), that man may have been evolving much faster in the area of \\"the technology of death\\" than in \\"the technology of peace.\\" Or to further mix the author's own metaphor: We learned how to unleash the dogs of war much better than we learned how to control our better angels.<br /><br />Unlike Mr. Pinker, Professor Rummel (who also takes the long, evolutionary, historical, global and psychological view of man's inhumanity to man) is not naïve about transient trends in international violence. For according to him, violence is not a random existential variable. It always gathers its meanings andstrength from the immediate psychological and socio-economic and political context from which it springs. And within that context, \\"power\\" is the fundamental ingredient that most accurately predicts to violence and conflict. But like in the case of the author's own metaphor, it is power that also predicts to peace and cooperation (or to the nature of our better angels). And these equations, according to Rummel, hold whether we are talking about interpersonal, tribal or international war and peace.<br /><br />Thus, the bad news that follows in the wake of this author's very good news, lurks in the demographic subtext of his theories and data (just as it did when we made the decision to drop the atomic bomb): that violence and crime against humans is still primarily a preoccupation highly prized as a virtue and as an honor by men alone, and mostly by young men. And since men still rule most of the civilized world and the average age of men in the world is declining, the glowing trends that the author speaks so eloquently of here could easily (and probably will) be reversed. Indeed, this could happen with a simple change in any of the socio-economic and political conditions in male dominated societies in regions of the world presently beset with conflicts.<br /><br />One glaring omission in the author's otherwise fine research is the failure to mention the role that organized religion has played throughout history and continues to play in the amount, intensity and levels of violence in the world. There is such a rich bibliography on this matter that its omission is just simply bizarre. In fact, although I say it only with tongue partially in cheek: with the elimination of both the effects of men and religion, the world would be more peaceful than it has been since Adam and Eve were cast from the garden of Eden.<br /><br />This point, and the overall demographic trend of increasing numbers of young men in the world itself, underscores and calls to mind the excellent reasons given by David T. Courtwright, (in his excellent book \\"Violent Lands\\") as to why the U.S. (even though one of the most technologically advanced nations in the world) has been throughout its history (and remains so today) one of the most violent nations in the history of the world.<br /><br />According to Courtwright (who is a patriotic American from Kansas), it is because the U.S. remains one of only a handful of countries with the unique demographic of having had a higher percentage of men than women throughout its history. Although women are only now finally catching up demographically, for all of U.S. history, owning to the way the U.S. was settled, we have been a nation that has made the use of violence and the glorification of violence (and \\"going to war\\") a part of our personal honor as well as a national virtue -- that is to say, a part of our cultural DNA.<br /><br />As a result, we, one of the most advanced societies in the world, also still engages in capital punishment, and are unique in the world as the nation that has gone to war more than any other country in the history of the world. But also, even a brief survey of our national history and the things that still animate us as a nation reveals all of the sins of a nation dominated by young men. To wit: slavery, genocide, eugenics, vigilante violence, the world's largest prison population, lynching, organized crime and mob violence, race riots, a nation overrun with guns and drugs, engaging in pre-emptive wars of choice, torture, renditions, and urban street gangs, just to mention the ones that come immediately to mind.<br /><br />Given that there are still nations (like China and India) that still engage in infanticide of female babies, artificially introducing a lop-sided young male demographic, one wonders how long it will be before other male dominated nation (with an increasingly younger male population) will follow the U.S. lead and again begin glorifying violence and raising violence to thelevel of a national value and virtue? Will there then be more wars? Slavery again? Re-subjugation of women? Who knows?  A fantastic read. Ten Stars.ons given by David T.

B00009L1UP|5.0|This CD contains some of Queensrÿche's best hits.  It also contains some bonus tracks that were not found on the original '90s version, including a cover of \\"Scarborough Fair\\" by Simon and Garfunkel.  My mother, who is in her sixties and remembers Simon and Garfunkel from when they were popular, listened to the Queensrÿche version and said that it was impressive; \\"they did a really good job.\\"  As to the other tracks on this CD, they are guaranteed to take you back musically.  Can't you feel it calling... :)
B000000I0G|5.0|first album I ever heard that uses bagpipes for rock music (even though it is only a few bars on the title track), well before Rod Stuart made it popular. a must have for your record collection.
B004SRNH10|5.0|Adobe Air is awesome! It amazes me how so many are saying the app sux because it won't work on their smelly phone. That's like saying one hates DVD's because they don't work in their VCR. Geez, some people are just inherently lame. Air rocks!
B0000072NV|5.0|another landmark album by Oldfield. he really was on top of his game at this time, with 5 miles out and crises arguably his best efforts. a must have if you like Oldfield.
1933492279|5.0|As a mechanic by profession, and a futurist by choice, this book is amazing.  Being able to see the future illustrated so vibrantly, stimulates my imagination.  The illustrations are mind expanding, not to mention wonderfully detailed.  This an excellent choice for future futurists.

B005HS4CUY|5.0|To begin this review off, I want to refer to all the other posts that are bashing amazon for \\"false advertising.\\"<br /><br />In the product details section, it says you will only receive 3 discs in this set. Each disc is a Bluray/Bluray 3d which means that you get two discs in one basically. If you read all of the fine print I'm surprised you skipped over that. You would've realized you were only receiving three discs - one for each movie.<br /><br />Aside from that, I purchased the other three movies in blu ray combos very cheap on the internet. About ten dollars for each to be precise. Each of the Bluray 3D combos are overpriced at a whopping $40! $120 for all three movies?! That's insane! If you want to get the 3D Experience and still have other discs to pop into other players, I recommend buying this and then some of the cheap, original blu ray combos on eBay that are little to nothing.<br /><br />You'll save yourself a lot of money.<br />In total I spent around $90 for all three movie sets including this wonderful 3D bundle amazon has.<br />$90 is better than $120 dollars.<br />For anybody who thinks they would've gotten a better deal just buying all three combo packs at $40 dollars a pop... you're crazy!<br />Save yourself some money and buy this!<br /><br />As a side note: I will tell you that the 3d video quality for all three movies is superb and the audio is great as well. I've now seen the first and second Toy Story's like never before.

0374275637|4.0|This is an excellent review of the research in the tradition initiated by Khaneman and Tversky. For those of you who are not familiar with this work, this is an interesting and very accessible introduction to that research. Sometimes I missed some references to recent research with contradictory conclusion, but given the format of the book that is acceptable. As an introduction into this research area I would give it 5 stars. Highly recommended.   For those of you familiar with Kahneman and Tversky's work from the 70s and 80s, the ideas discussed in the book should be mostly well known, perhaps with an exception for the first part. This is my reason for the 4-star rating.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Currently I have been trying to put together a strong mixture of concerts,,, hopefully Blue-ray and have been finding things a little slim out there of QUALITY work. I am watching it on a 210\\" hd projector system and so the picture has got to be there for me. I started ordering concerts from Netflix for a demo to see if they are worthy of purchasing and not just a money toss- which for the past few months I have been thanking Netflix for saving me lots money! Read the reviews both here on Amazon and on Netflix and had this one in the \\"Q\\". I just received the blue-ray several hours ago in the mail from Netflix and told my wife, well this could be over in 5 minutes........ well that was over 2.5 hours ago.  OK, I will admit that I did not know the real history of David's work, what rock was I under? But as most of the posts noted, I was beyond stunned- speechless- and then a little 16 year girl came out named Charice, I then just lost my breath too. I just ordered it in blue-ray to add to my collection (Thanks Amazon!)  Video for a concert- 5 stars, details and camera work are always difficult for concerts but this was pulled together nicely, reminds me of Sting with the RPO in Blue-ray  Sound in DTS-HD, again,,, I just lost my breath, incredible balance and with such an array of signers,, WOW! 8 stars!!!!  I am not writing this review to get thumbs up approval but to ensure people out there, like me that kinda look at concerts with a grain of salt- until proven.... Well I hope you have a good sound system cause you WILL BE TESTING THE HELL OUT OF IT'S LIMITS. You could just tell how each artist was really pushing their levels and still just having a great time. This is important to me, I enjoyed the very brief history through several of the songs and getting a better understanding of David's life. What a gifted group of people.  The music just continued to flow- this is entertainment!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It was fun, entertaining and really tied things up well, the movie deserves 4 stars, however!!!. The reason for this post is the HORRIBLE Ultraviolet copy, not a true digital copy. Ultraviolet streams the movie and dosn't use the now industry standards for Mac and Win. The movie is NOT stored on the computer as iTunes files or windows format video files. The movie streams from Flixter, which is horribly broken. If you dont have internet connectivity you cant watch the movie. If you have a slow connection you loose frames for a horrible watching experience and if you pay for internet access by the megabyte you pay more then the movie costs on BluRay just to watch it once. It just dosn't work well.<br /><br />Why is Warner Brothers changing a system people have become use to and a system for digital copies that most people like.. Ultraviolet is a solution where no problem exists. This is change that only WB and Flixter want. Digital format users are mostly happy with the system that has been developed, iTunes etc.<br /><br />I have tried to contact WB to issue my complaint, to no avail. I did go to WB on Facebook and posted, along with only one other person, my dislike for Ultraviolet. I also recommend Amazon give feedback to WB of our dislike of Ultraviolet. I'm not a fan of ripping movies but it looks like that may be the only way to get WB movies in a digital format so we can watch the movie where and when we want and on what device we choose. Do what you can to avoid Ultraviolet and complain and complain often until they listen.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Amazing story.  I don't believe there is a person in the last 1000 years who, in almost every way, was such a study in contrast...  An indisputable genius/ mind-numbing poor decision maker.  One of the greatest \\"idea man\\" of all time/one of the worst \\"idea man\\" of all time.  Emotional/emotionless  No one besides maybe Henry Ford could get a group of people to produce so much in a short time/ yet he himself held up productivity to the point of madness.  Fantastic designer/products often failed due to poor design  I could go on. It is truly fascinating to read this man's story. This guy could employ an entire floor of psychiatrist for generations to try and explain his psychological makeup.  Amazing
0064430170|3.0|I received the book in ok shape. Granted, I was searching for used books so I am not completely blameless in this interaction. However, I would've liked to have known that the book had been drenched in some kind of brown liquid that had wrinkled the pages and ripped the cover. I am a teacher in a very low-income school/city - so I know about making do with faulty products. However, this one left little to be desired from it. On the positive side - the item arrived in record time and my students have enjoyed it greatly.
B000I9YX06|2.0|I've seen this movie three times, and still can't force myself to like it. Frankly, it's boring. Will Smith looks bored, so does Bridget Moynahan (Sylvia Calvin) and Chi McBride. The \\"funny\\" one-liners are boring, too. The only person smiling in this production seems to be the robot, Sonny. And he's mostly animated! The movie is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, when the robots come alive and try to take over the world (what else?). But not by much. Even during the finale, Smith and Moynahan look bored and boring! \\"I, Robot\\" ends with a cliff-hanger, implying that another revolution is in the air, this time led by the nice guy Sonny. But since there's no sequel, we're ultimately left with nothing at all...<br /><br />Two stars.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series is exciting, uniquely written and impossible to predict.  This book is another step forward in an expansive word filled with dragons, treachery and things that go bump in the night.  I only wish is that the other books in this series come quickly.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Like the previous 4 seasons of Dexter, this one is awesome.  Cannot wait for the 6th to be on DVD.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Maybe I'm old fashioned but I still like owning a disc and I like the superior fidelity of blu-ray - I buy quite a few movies.  But I will not buy this blu-ray disc or any other without a iTunes compatible digital copy.  I can get my entertainment from Netflix.  Are you listening movie studios?  Amazon?
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was quickly hooked on the kitchen house.  The character development was superb, there were so many good people to root for in the story and you easily become immersed in their world.  There are many heart breaking events it becomes a tale of survival in a somewhat brutal time in American history.  I have since read several other books, but nothing has moved me quite like The Kitchen House.
B000GCFX36|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author.  I bought it when it was a special for the Kindle - figuring that it was probably a chick lit love story.  Not the case at all.<br /><br />It turns out to be a story about a young woman coming to terms with and overcoming her various addictions.  The characters in the story are well represented and the progression is very believable.  I enjoyed the book tremendously and will certainly read more by this author.  She has a gift for pinpointing a character trait and then pinning it to the wall for all to see and learn by example.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I agree with everyone, this \\"SO-CALLED\\" digital copy on ultraviolet is a joke! I will not buy any movie that comes with it... Warner Bros. needs to get it together and go back to a real digital copy! until then, I will buy these movies directly from iTunes and play it on my apple TV.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|You can't get into WOW without a keyboard to type your password, but once you are there this mini-board will do everything else. It comes with a software cd, but be sure to download the logitech 8.01.120 upgrade.
B0037KMHRY|4.0|I was excited to get the sound track to Tron Legacy, though not a Daft Punk fan. They made a great score befitting the movie and energized the visual realm. I was disappointed a little in the repetitive nature of some tracks, it left one wanting the piece to move to a new chord etc. But the mix of orchestra and the gifted electronic filtering displayed by the Punk were fun and enjoyable.
0525423656|3.0|Like 'Matched,' 'Crossed' is an engaging read that you don't want to put down. However, it's not nearly as gripping as the first book. Most of the time, it feels as though the experience of escaping from Society is just being drug along for the sake of filling pages. There's very little character development for Ky or Cassia, and the new characters added are flat and one-dimensional. It is interesting to see things from Ky's perspective, but the way the author switches between perspectives every chapter gets a bit confusing at times.  Overall, I have to agree with other reviewers that this would probably have worked better if it were included in the 1st and/or 3rd book, rather than being stretched out into a full trilogy.
B005IGVYUG|2.0|I've been a Tom Waits fan for many years now and have come to put him above former songwriting heroes like Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell.  Tom Waits is the Picasso of music.  He was never tied to one sound and will experiment to achieve his artistic expression.  Sure he has borrowed heavily from Howlin' Wolf and Louis Armstrong but everything is derivative is some way.    Now,with Bad as Me, Waits has lost something.  This pains me to say but it is simply not as interesting as some of his more powerful work (which I would consider his debut, Heart of Saturday Night, Rain Dogs, Franks Wild Years, Bone Machine, and Mule Variations).  The lyrics are not as creative or poetic (Tell Me sounds like a bunch of questions a child would ask and they're just thrown together with little rhyme or reason), the songwriting isn't as engaging when the album is rowdy (with the exception of Hell Broke Luce) or as beautiful when the album is melancholy (Back in the Crowd just falls short of achieving the beauty of Hold On and falls very short of Time) and the album as a whole is not cohesive.  In a way, that last point is almost refreshing because you hear songs like Pay Me where the vocals sound like they came from Franks Wild Years or Bad As Me which sounds like a Mule Variations outtake.    It ALMOST feels like an intentional retrospective with all new material and that sort of works but, due to an overall lower quality to the writing (excerpt from Last Leaf:  \\"I'm the last leaf on the tree/ the Autumn took the rest/ but they won't take me\\"- who is THEY?  Is Autumn now plural?) the disjointedness of songs magnifies the weaknesses within the songs.  The first track, Chicago, is one chord over and over and over.  Satisfied just sounds like some friends fooling around with no intention of actually releasing the song (Waits speaking directly to Keith Richards and rhyming 'Richards' with 'itchin' is embarrasing and beneath the songwriter).  The posed carnival like photos of Waits are,at this point, getting old.  Stand out tracks are the title track and Get Lost, which has a similar feel to Lie To Me from Orphans- very bouncy, positive, pseudo 1950's bop sound.   I think it is time for yet another new manifestation of Tom Waits.  For a man who has changed his style as often as Waits, that's not asking too much.  Who knows, perhaps the absence of clanging percussion and focus on more traditional instrumentation on this album is in fact a signal of changes to come.
B005KJZDXK|3.0|I enjoy the combo of M.Ward and Zooey. A perfect late 50's and mid 60's sound. I do agree with others, however. Zooey's voice is not my overall preference but what she does is quite nicely presented. She is a little too sweet voiced on some cuts for me but M. Wards arrangements are spot on--sparse but fulfilling and the combo makes a \\"nice\\" Christmas recording reminiscient of simpler times. I also agree that a few solos by M. Ward and more duets could have made this more interesting.
B004SRWW0C|3.0|Unable to update as I bought this from Amazon. Going forward Amazon purchases for apps will require 2nd thought. Not fair as I have paid for this.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|WE haven't been this blown away from a music video since Fleetwood Mac's \\"the Dance\\".  Celine's Live in Las Vegas-A new day, is utterly fantastic, each song is augmented by fantastic stage performances by her dancers, the aerial effects are out of this world!  I can promise that this will be an unforgettable viewing experience. It is Celine's finest!

The only people living in North America in 1500 were Indians. Even the Spaniards had barely made a dent (Columbus was not even dead, yet). So, I don't want to buy the book if that is an example of his historical (in)accuracy.  Don Brittain  La Luz, NM

1609611543|4.0|I enjoyed the book, and thought it had a lot of good  points to think about.  I didn't know that wheat was  the only grain that is acidic while all the others are  alkaline.  I gave up pancakes thirty years ago because  they \\"stopped me up\\".  I get a sub sandwich very rarely  with the thick bread for the same reason.  After reading  the book, I am making adjustments to living on Stoffer  frozen dinners which are half noodles (wheat).  I don't  plan on cutting out wheat entirely but can get free of  75% of it.  Really good book. I recommend.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|An average sequel movie, worst than the first movie but much better than the second one.  Pretty clear quality and great action. Too much focus on the humans, should feature more of the Transformers.  Bluray is great but contains NO extra content whatsoever. Only contains the DVD and Digital Copy.
B0001GMIOE|1.0|I purchased this item along with a pair of knockoff batteries. My original OEM battery lasted for years so I figured I would replace it with another OEM but the price of the knockoff made it easy to justify even if they proved to be substandard.  Imagine my surprise when the cheap knockoff batteries were of better quality than the \\"OEM\\" battery this seller sent me.  I first noticed the battery printing seemed of inferior quality but it didn't occur to me at the time that this battery may be a fraud until after 6 weeks of use when I observed that the battery consistently would not hold a charge.  After thorough testing I came to the conclusion that this item was of inferior quality and not of Canon manufacture.  I contacted the seller several times requesting a replacement and after 4 emails and 3 weeks, I finally received a single sentence reply from John Quagen from Mellodigital customer service: \\"We are sorry you are past the return policy\\".  It was true, after reading the company fine print, they have a 14 day return policy and I was past the return date.  Even it I was within the time limit, I didn't receive a reply from them for nearly 3 weeks after my initial inquiry.  So, buyer beware! this company will sell you a cheap knock off at full OEM prices and will not stand by their customer or product once the check clears.
B000W1V7K4|3.0|High-def video, translated well to bluray except for one scene. Bluray extras were only mediocre, nothing much about how the movie was made.
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|If you like movies where the end question is \\"Who did it\\", then this is your kind of movie. I bought it in Blu Ray only because most of the scenes are in a dark elevator and i didn't want to miss any of the action.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Great movie. Above average extra content but could have more extras related to how the movie was made. All in all, great bluray to own.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Great audio, great unreleased material, and great live footage of Genesis with Steve Hackett and Peter Gabriel.  Plus informative commentary about the making of and the inspiration for all five albums.  Worth every penny.
1568497369|5.0|Timeless, majestic, terrifying, breathtaking. The masterpiece by the British lady. You read it. Then you can read it once again even knowing the ending. And you read it again. It's that kind of book. Marvellous.

B005GVW05Q|5.0|First off, let me be clear-if Mr. Adams released 103 CD's, I'd buy every one of them.  If he played a concert in my town a dozen times a year, I'd attend every one of them.  Yes, I like Ryan Adams a lot.  After dabbling in every genre, every type of band configuration, and being incredibly prolific, he's made a singer's record. I have always been struck by how fantastic a singer he is live and how that never seemed to translate to his recordings.  Finally, you can hear that on this record-Ryan Adams, vocalist.  He probably couldn't quite pull that off before with the drug and alcohol use, smoking, and a heavy touring schedule.  The rough edges are smoothed out now, and he truly is a lovely singer.    If you are looking for \\"Heartbreaker\\" again, you won't quite find that on \\"Ashes and Fire.\\"  If you are looking for the flip side of that part of his life, it's right here.  Absent is the drinking and drugging, and the broken heart with the lover gone.  Nope.  He can't write those songs now-that's not who he is anymore.  This time the girl stayed, and while it hasn't always been easy, he isn't leaving this time-and neither is she.  That is the essence of these songs-love is hard, love is worth it, and Adams is grateful for the opportunity to try love again.  We have here quiet understated elegance with some of the hallmarks of everything Adams has ever put out-strong opening song in \\"Dirty Rain,\\" strong closing song in \\"I Love You But I Don't Know What To Say,\\" strong melodies, nice guitar work, well written lyrics, with a great vocal performance.  I find this a perfect release for this time of year, as fall heads towards winter.  And I'm sure glad, for Mr. Adams' sake, that it ain't raining anymore.  Buy this, it's fantastic!
0316069884|5.0|When people are asked which book changed their life, many automatically spit out a classic: Catcher in the Rye, a Jane Eyre novel, or something by Nabokov. This book was my life-changer. I have been a carnivore for 31 years, and I waffled between feeling guilty about eating animals and relishing their taste. Since reading this book, I have not eaten a single animal product. While the moral argument is compelling on its own, the threat of disease and the lack of regulations are what ultimately nailed the coffin on the head for me. I appreciate Foer's candidness and his unbiased research. But unlike other major issues in politics and economics, this one needs very little rhetoric to move the reader. The facts are shocking enough on their own. The most dedicated meat eaters will give pause after reading this. It is truly an eye-opening journey that everyone should undergo.
B005EXA8XC|5.0|Legendary concert with Nirvana during their meteoric rise on the heels of Smells Like Teen Spirit. The concert took place in Seattle on Halloween, only about a month after Nevermind was released. Some of the clips showed up on the \\"Live! Tonight! Sold Out!\\" video, and now the full concert is finally officially released on video (only took 20 years).  A must have in any Nirvana collection. Look for a couple of easter eggs - clips from a show in Vancouver, BC in March of that year!

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|These are good for the price. They pick up sound from every direction though, so Im not sure they will work well for outside interviews or anywhere with lots of background noise. The wire is very long and thin, so be careful. I havent even unraveled them all the way because i dont want a tangled mess. With that said, i think these will be ok for a backup mic. Note: they are not stereo, so you will need an adapter if you want sound on both channels/speakers.

0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is one of the best books I've read in years. I've been looking for something that would completely capture my attention and interest. I was looking for a book I couldn't put down, and half a dozen books in a row disappointed me in that respect. Then I picked up the book everyone was talking about. The beginning was quite difficult. I didn't really care about the characters and I was somewhat confused by what was going on, considering Larsson's great detail in explaining Swedish government, laws and politicians at some points, which I know absolutely nothing about. But once Blomkvist is invited to visit Mr. Vagner, the real story begins and the book really takes off. The plot develops in such a way, with small, strange things popping up that keep the reader's interest peaked. Every time one question is answered, several new ones emerge. The character's personalities, quirks and personal interaction become fascinating. I sped through this series and am deeply saddened Larsson can't produce us with anything further, having passed away before the fourth novel in the series could be completed.

1932907009|5.0|This is an excellent reference book for anyone looking to write a screenplay. The way the process is easily laid out and organized makes the act of starting to write a screenplay a less daunting project. As I was going through Save The Cat with my own screenplay in mind, I realized just how many holes needed filling. The book also helps you to very easily and concisely separate the \\"necessary\\" from the \\"extraneous\\" which, if it can do that for you in just a paragraph or two, shows that the book is extremely valuable. A friend of mine who wrote a fantastic screenplay was the one who recommended this book to me, and I will from this point on, recommend it to anyone else who wants to write a screenplay.
B005MTHRAA|5.0|... including none of Pier Paolo Pasolini's other films! Pasolini was not interested in movie-making as an enterprise, or a career, and he never repeated himself. His \\"Mamma Roma\\", which I've reviewed just a few days ago, was his tribute to Italian Neo-Realismo, so perhaps we could label \\"Medea\\" as Neo-Irrealismo. Filmed in the late 1960s in Cappadocia (Turkey), Medea is a cinematic rival for James George Fraser's 'Golden Bough', a study that asserted the unity of all religious symbols and myths in the deepest history of Man's 'barbaric yawp'. Actually, I'd be surprised if Pasolini wasn't consciously aware of Fraser's work, which was at the height of its influence on poets and anthropologists during his lifetime. In any case, Pasolini assembled all the barbaric splendor of the eastern Mediterranean for this film; the costumes amount to a visual ethnographic museum, and many of them must have been what the villagers around G&ouml;reme were actually still wearing when the Italian camermen arrived. The color quality of this film has deteriorated, even in restoration, but visually this is a spectacle beyond your wildest dreams. The human sacrifice scene at the beginning of Jason's visit to Medea's bizarre realm seems to me to draw on historical accounts of such sacrifice among the Aztecs at the time of the Conquest.<br /><br />Likewise, Pasolini has compounded music from Iran, India, Japan, and who-knows-where into a soundtrack of truly barbaric intensity. A lot of the music I recognize now, though I surely didn't when I saw the film first decades ago. It's from the Japanese Bunraku puppet theater. Music is a big part of this film, equalling the visual splendors in affect. On the other hand, the script is sparse, almost minimal; minutes and whole scenes pass without a word. But don't suppose that the film is \\"slow\\". In fact, it's startling, gory, raucous throughout, every bit a real barbaric yawp.<br /><br />The presence of the great Maria Callas, the most fiery opera diva of her era, gets a lot of notice from critics, but her acting skills, good as they were, were not essential. It was her very fame in the role of the opera Medea, by Cherubini, that justified her place in this cast in the role of Medea. Pasolini's films, believe me, are full of such cross-references and allusions. If you don't know the story of Jason and Medea well, you'll have trouble simply following the action of the film, with is elliptical and suggestive rather than forthrightly narrative. Read the story as told by Euripedes, see the opera by Cherubini, and thus you'll be enabled to grasp what Pasolini has modified for his own purpose.<br /><br />Pasolini's purpose has elements of philosophical didacticism, concerning the 'transformation' of pre-modern religious humanity into modern post-religious humanity. But don't worry if that's an obscure thought; the Centaur who has raised Jason, and who has the largest speaking role in the film, will make it quite plain.<br /><br />This is a stunning and unforgettable movie. If you saw it years ago, you'll see it differently now, with your greater stock of reference points. If you've never seen it, do so. You won't be bored.ot of notice from critics, but her acting skills, good as they were, were not essential.

0553801473|2.0|That's a scary title, isn't it? But the similarity to Jordan's endless, meandering story telling is hard to avoid when one reads this book. Like many of the reviewers, I was deeply disappointed in A Dance with Dragons -- it just goes on and on,  little happens to really move the story forward, a number of favorite characters are missing (but after a point, who cares?) and, yes, it was a lo-o-ng wait for this book, which makes everything worse. Poor George Martin, I wonder how he feels after reading these fan reviews, after being heaped with encomia for so many years by just about everyone.  Martin has mentioned recently, in a blog posting, that he was a friend of Jordan -- but he must have been aware of how Jordan totally lost control of his material, he's just too good a writer when he's on his game.  Yet he has fallen into the same trap -- 70% of the material in Dance could have been edited down or out (ok, maybe 50%)-- my main feeling after slogging thru Dance was \\"is this it\\"? A fellow reader, very smart, well-read and well-informed about fantasy/sf, told me he liked it, so, though it didn't change my opinion, made me think I might have a minority view -- uh, no, seems like most readers feel the way I do -- and started writing about it sooner.  These negative Amazon postings were quite an eye-opener when I read them months after Dance was published. So, sigh, what more is there to say?  No doubt it will be years before Martin has a chance to \\"redeem\\" himself with the publication of a fast-moving, plot-advancing novel -- if only he can. He seems like a nice guy, wish him well, don't think this was a deliberate, make-more-money ploy, but, oi-vey, what a misfire this book was.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|Up-front warning: there are no exploding cars, steamy sex scenes or \\"You can't handle the truth!\\" catch-phrases in this remarkable movie. Don't get me wrong, I like that type of movie, but this is something different. It's a drama, not a melodrama. It's a reality show about actual reality, which unlike most reality shows, usually moves along in an orderly fashion.<br /><br />If you've never been a manager in a serious company, it might not appeal to you. As an ex-software company exec, I can say it felt real to me. I found the story exciting, because I could relate to the characters and their understated pain. Many things are shown, rather than stated. For example, they work all night long in their suits, but no one ever talks about going home, or the hours, etc. If you've been in a management crisis and experienced a long hellish night, you'll feel this movie in your bones.<br /><br />The best part was the placement of the viewer in the shoes of the company execs. Imagine your place of work for 20 or 30 years going down in flames around you. If you are a teacher, imagine the school is going to close at the end of the week forever if you make the wrong choice tonight. Every kid in your school will never be educated if you fail. The only way to possibly save yourself and your students is to lie your ass off. That is not a fun place to be, and that's the tension behind the film.<br /><br />On a final note, I didn't sense an overt political viewpoint from the filmmakers. I didn't feel this was a hit-piece on Wall Street or anyone else. It was dramatized and probably shrunken down in time-scale, but quite believable. I found that refreshing.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|\\"The Night Circus\\" is a magical read.  Delicious descriptions, engaging dialogue and creative plot--all rolled together in a book that you will not want to put down.  Reading this was an addiction and kept my mind and imagination expanding.  Basic dilemma:  Is the best magic learned or inherent?  Perhaps the answer is that the greatest magic is neither....<br /><br />Forces outside manipulate the two protagonists Celia and Marco.  Once force concrete the other is a reflection or ghost of former self.  Their playground is a night circus that creates magic every night thanks to the competition between these two forces.<br /><br />As you read this book, you will wish you would drive by a surprise circus with black and white tents that is only open at night so you can experience the magic of this circus in real life.<br /><br />The characters that surround Celia and Marco are complete novels unto themselves.  The set of psychic twins, the Chinese contortionist, the theater mogul weave a delicious design that permeates this book.<br /><br />So, if you want to forget about that never ending \\"to do\\" list and want to escape somewhere beyond imagination, climb into this book and enjoy!

0670022950|5.0|In The Better Angels, Steven Pinker has finally hit his stride and established himself as a true public intellectual.  In what is by far his best book, Pinker makes a compelling case that we live in the most peaceful, violence-free period in history, and that there is a clear long-term historical trend of the reduction of physical violence of every kind and at every level.  What is extraordinary is that, not only does this fly in the face of conventional wisdom, but no one seems to have made this argument or even suggested this before.  The book is long, detailed, and full of graphs, charts, and statistics, but that is because it has to be - for the Conventional Wisdom insists that this claim cannot possibly be correct.  Conservatives believe that society is in a breakdown mode due to the decay of traditional family and religious values; liberals believe that violence is endemic to global capitalism and imperialism; the average person believes the criminals and child molesters are running wild on the streets.  But Pinker demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt that just the opposite is true. This is perhaps the most important single development in all of human history, and it is simply astonishing that no one seems to have heard of it.  And probably no one else could have written this book besides Pinker, with his brilliance, his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, and his omnivorous reading habits in many disciplines, from science to philosophy to literature.<br /><br /> Pinker's book sets out not only to document this trend, but even more ambitiously, to give an explanation for it.  And here Pinker is successful as well (with a few caveats, mentioned below). Greatly to his credit, Pinker departs from the standard evolutionary psychology approach (in which we are deterministic &#34;demonic males&#34; and so forth) and ventures to give a sort of explanation that is almost entirely out of fashion these days especially in scientific circles, and that will come across as sentimental softness.  But Pinker makes a compelling case that it is not our instincts, our &#34;mental modules&#34; or &#34;stone age minds&#34; that have caused the decline in violence, but rather our REASON and our MORALITY.  There is, Pinker says, nothing more powerful than an idea (415).  Over time, people have come to develop their rationality and their moral faculties in a way that makes violence no longer an acceptable way of solving problems.  Moreover, government plays an essential role in this process (despite the fashionable conservative mantra that government is the source of all our problems).  By establishing a monopoly on force, the state made the single most important contribution to violence reduction.  And by providing universal education and ensuring that commerce can take place in a nonviolent setting, the state set the stage for ever-decreasing levels of violence.<br /><br />The one pervasive flaw in Pinker's approach is his dogmatic, reflexive bias against religion.  In Pinkerworld, all good things came out of the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution/Age of Reason, and everything that happened before then reflects ignorance, superstition, and anti-humanism.  This bias distorts his historical analysis, for instance entirely discounting the influence of Christiantiy.  Like so many New Atheists, he quotes at length from the violence of the Old Testament, but entirely ignores the opposite message of love, mercy, and forgiveness, notably (but not exclusively) in the New Testament.  Jesus is after all the Prince of Peace, and his message is to turn the other cheek, not resist evil, forgive, love your enemy, etc., etc.  One would have thought that this moral revolution might have figured large in a book on the decline of violence, especially as Christianity is the world's biggest religion.  But Pinker dismisses it in a couple of lines, presumably because it threatens his ideological view that nothing good can possibly come from religion.  Similarly, Pinker sings the praises of teh 18th century idea of universal human rights, but almost entirely dismisses the fact that all major religions discovered the idea of the Golden Rule thousands of years before.  However, the thesis of the book stands even despite this bias, and indeed the development of religion in a direction towards nonviolence if anything would only strengthen Pinker's thesis, if he were not so dogmatically hostile to religion.<br /><br />This is a powerful and important book, and it should have a wide influence on public policy debates.  Unfortunately, since politicians get votes by scaring voters about the terrible evils out there (terrorists, criminals, etc), it probably won't get the attention it deserves.  It is also a 700-page tome, and hence most people won't have the time to go through it carefully.  But they should - it is that important.eligion.

B005QMOZOO|5.0|Great read, P. D. James is to be congratulated on this enjoyable follow up to Pride and Prejudice.  The characters remain faithful to those in the original book, unlike some other books who follow up on P&P.  The balance between the murder mystery and the romances is well achieved and you are always anxious to discover what will happen next. The explanation of legal system operating in England at that time is comprehensive and easy to understand. The suprise use of Characters from other Austen books is appropriate and in character, you could think they all knew each other. The result was appropriate and satisfing.  My husband was satisfied with the murder mystery content, and I enjoyed the follow on from the original book.  Enjoy.
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs might be the most influential person of the last half century.  His work and products literally affect every one of us in some way.  He was undeniably a genius and his resurrection of Apple starting in the late 90s is the stuff of legend.  To do full justice to his life, 600 or so pages isn't nearly sufficient, but it's a good overview of the man.  Jobs wasn't a nice guy, but to achieve that level of success, who could be?  He had a premonition that he'd live a relatively short life and that he had to achieve great things quickly.  This is one guy who truly changed the world.    There's a lot of talk about his life being turned into a movie, but really, how can you condense his life into a 2 or 3 hour film?  A Ken Burns type documentary over several parts might be more appropriate.  Very highly recommended.

0060833459|5.0|The Effective Executive: The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done by Peter Drucker focuses on self-management rather than on the management of others. The book addresses how an individual can become more effective in key activities such as time management, activity prioritization, and decision-making to the furtherance of their organization's goals.<br /><br />I believe that an organization's actions are defined by its people and not the buildings, machines, and tools they use - organizations themselves fundamentally behave like people. Subsequently, as individuals become more effective, such that their decisions and activities are increasingly focused on mission achievement, the organization itself is more likely to achieve greater levels of success. Because the principles contained within The Effective Executive focus on strong leadership, when they are built into processes and procedures, additional measurable improvements in organizational effectiveness can be achieved.<br /><br />The Effective Executive clearly and concisely conveys many powerful leadership concepts.

Justin Timberlake offers a humorous turn as a dimwitted love interest; Lucy Punch is on target as the uberteacher and Cameron's rival; Jason Segel and Phyllis Smith round out the cast.<br />BAD TEACHER avoids many of this genre's cliches.  There are no redemptive moments or sudden enlightening revelations.  The tone is consistent to say the least!<br />All in all, BAD TEACHER is somewhat guilty pleasure but doesn't inspire a lot of educational appreciation.

B00008RWRH|5.0|I have heard and loved most Jochum recordings since the lp era. He is my favorite conductor whom I consider a genius. This Haydn set mostly confirms this view. The exception is reflected in a FEW outer movts, especially first movts, which are too quick. Jochum said/wrote that some of these movts should be played as quickly as possible. This is the case here w/ his #98 and 100.  I also prefer his Dresden #93 and 98 primarily for this reason, but not the fine Dresden 94 b/c the DG version is the best \\"Surprise\\" ever-eg listen to the opening  winds in movt.1 and the 2nd movt wind variation .  The other echt Jochums here are 95, 96, 97, 99, 104 and 103  though I do wish  that DG had also reissued his mono 103 also -could live w/o its record mate here- #91).

I also like Lenny's 97-99 with reservations.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Spielberg bought the rights of the adventures of Tintin, at least those starting with this episode when Captain Haddock comes into the picture. So we will have one film every Yule season, at least, if the actors survive the series or do not age too fast, though the digital processing of them enables them to age unseen in their digital skins.<br /><br />The choice of technology and actors is perfect for those roles that are so well known that they do not admit any kind of mistake. The Dupont-ds are supposed to be perfect, and what's more perfectly dumb and inefficient, which they are. The very antagonistic representation of the Belgian policeman or inspector seen as Hercule Poirot for example. I must say the dog, Milou, is less convincing in that processing. He is processed slightly too much and smells as if he were just out of the dog's beauty parlor. The Castafiore is a marvelous superb operatic monster and she is truer than she could be in real reality.<br /><br />The story is an old pirate story and Captain Haddock is an ignominious drunkard but he is fabulous in the desert and when he is reliving the adventures of his ancestor. At that level the film is quite a success for those who like pirate films and sea fights with sail ships, fire, canon powder, sabers and swords, etc. The falcon is also a good chap who fulfils his part quite well.<br /><br />What Spielberg managed with great success is the great variety of landscapes, seascapes and other locations that is extremely important in this comic strip that leads the readers from the popular suburban areas of Brussels to the Sahara desert, the French foreign legion, the Atlantic by boat and the Atlantic by hydroplane, the unstable setting of a ship or a flying plane, as well as the disturbed stable setting of a city of a harbor. The duel with harbor cranes is quite a good idea indeed and spectacular.<br /><br />Those of you who have known Tintin when you were the same age as the comic books will find it realistically done. Those who are from a younger generation will like the action and the special effects, and of course the chase for the treasure. You will only get the first leg of it right now, but next year, it is a promise, you get the second leg. After that If I believe the images of the opening credits you are going to get  the moon, Tournesol and quite a few more of these adventures.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|These past few years we have been repeatedly smacked over the head with super hero movies. Not that it's a bad thing since I admit I have enjoyed just about all of them so far. As someone that has never been into comic books I have been able to go into these types of movies with little to no expectations other than what I had seen from the previews.   Chris Evans (Fantastic Four 1, Fantastic Four 2, and Sunshine) is cast as the hero Captain America. I was a little resistant to his selection for the role at first due to him playing the Human Torch previously, but at the same time knew that he had the talent to make Captain America all that it could be. For the first quarter of the movie we see underachieving Steve Rodgers do everything in his power to get accepted into the Army. There is a very good bonus feature that describes the several different ways the studio was able to make the pre-hero Rodgers look so realistic. All the sets we see in this movie make it feel very authentic and fresh. It really looks like a lot of effort was put into making everything from the costumes, vehicles, and tech gadgets look believable for that time period (especially the Red Skull and his car!). From what I have read and been told there were some liberties taken by the studio that don't necessarily sync this movie up the comic books. From my vantage point I can't say I found any glaring problems with the movie from start to finish and was impressed with the way Stark Industries got plenty of face time.  Overall, I think the casting set this movie up to be very successful. The acting is about as good as you could hope for in a comic book adaptation movie. It has plenty of heart, action, and just enough humor to keep the mood somewhat light from time to time. The bonus features were pretty good and plentiful. My only complaint would be that the Blu Ray transfer is not as sharp as I hoped for, definitely not as sharp looking as The Green Lantern or Thor. In the end this is a fun-filled couple hour escape from reality that should please most fans. 4.5/5
B00499K9E0|5.0|Wow, I don't even know. I love this show! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman do a spectacular job capturing the roles of Sherlock and John. The stories are gems and full of funny Sherlockian hints and jokes. If you're looking for a new way to sink your teeth into our favorite sleuth than this is your best bet! Also, it's written by Moffat and Gatiss! What about that doesn't scream goodness!?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy was an amazing series that I would recommend to any and all of my friends. I had heard that they were making a movie of the books, and it was featuring some actors that I liked, I decided \\"What the heck!\\" and I got it. I finished it in a day, (because when I like a book a lot, I completely devour it, not because it was a light read.) and immediately ran to my computer to purchase \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\". A friend told me that he hated the series, and that the end wasn't good at all, but I completely disagree. He cannot stand people dying, which is what drew me in in the first place. Luckily he got the series at the library. The only thing that left me unsatisfied was that I felt that there wasn't enough closure with one or two of the characters. But overall This is my new Favorite series, and I'm sad that it's over.

B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-Man is not my #1 favorite super hero, but he is definitely in my top 5. I think they did an excellent job of this movie and # 2 and 3 as well. I was real sorry to hear that Tobey Maguire was not gonna be in the next Spider-Man, but I guess I'll have to live with it.
0515123447|4.0|I only recently discovered Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, so I'll be brief here -- I see that many people have already written a good deal about this book.  I loved \\"Killing Floor\\" and found it riveting.  The sentence fragments and other stylistic choices that make some readers call the writing \\"choppy\\" did not bother me a bit.  To the contrary, since the book is written as a first-person account by the main character, Jack Reacher, I thought the sentence fragments were part of Reacher's \\"voice.\\"  I also enjoyed the author's use of verbs that engage multiple senses and brought me right into the action.  For instance, when a cop opens a desk drawer Child writes:  \\"He rattled open a drawer.\\"  To describe the action of an electronic door lock, Child writes:  \\"The electric bolts snicked home.\\"  Verbs like those make the book extremely entertaining, IMO, and, since the Jack Reacher character is the narrator of the whole story, the verbs help develop his character.    Next paragraph requires a SPOILER ALERT:  The main thing I wish Child had done better is the character of the female cop (Roscoe).  He uses her only as Reacher's \\"love interest\\" (i.e., sex partner).  When the final big fight comes between the good guys and the bad, the female cop is present but fails to act like a cop at all.  She passively waits for the men to rescue her, and Reacher actually physically carries her out of the danger zone in his arms.  Come on!  A real cop would have been grabbing for a weapon from one of the wounded or dead guys, and would not have simpered around waiting for a man to carry her away!  The second thing that I wish he had done differently, is when the evil FBI agent shows up in the final fight -- even though Reacher had supposedly killed him many hours before, on the side of a freeway.  His appearance in that final confrontation mystified me and, IMO, required some explanation of how he came to be there.  As you can tell by my conferring of 5 stars, though, I found the book's good points far outweighed its flaws.  I intend to read more of the books in this series, for sure!

B0054N73EY|4.0|In 1984, Red Hot Chili Peppers released their self-titled debut without much fanfare. In fact, they were technically only half a band on that cd, with Cliff Martinez on drums and Jack Sherman on guitar as Chad Smith and Hillel Slovak had contractual obligations to their band What Is This? Many artists come charging out of the gate with a classic debut and never seem to be able to match that again in their careers. Not so for Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their debut is so underwhelming that they could only improve, and improve they did.<br /><br />Also, I was an avid watcher of MTV at that time, and I have no memory of seeing their music videos until, maybe, 1989's \\"Mother's Milk\\". I always remember them being underground or what is now called alternative music. Perhaps they were played on MTV's \\"120 Minutes\\", but that always aired at midnight, not prime viewing time for most. They certainly did not get played on the radio in Aurora, Colorado. I never heard their music hit radio until \\"Mother's Milk\\" with \\"Knock Me Down\\" and their cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\". And let's be truthful here, in all discussions about great bands from the 1980's, Red Hot Chili Peppers do not immediate spring to most people's minds. That's likely due to the fact that the Peppers just weren't heard much, and were not given much exposure. But if you go back and listen to those first three albums you can hear the promise that would be realized later. But I digress.....<br /><br />More line-up changes, and then the death of Slovak in 1988 made it seem as if the band were done for. But they regrouped with Jack Irons on drums and John Frusciante on guitar and had what could now be considered their classic line-up. This gave new blood to the band who then released 1989's \\"Mother's Milk\\" and 1991's \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\". Another line-up change with Frusciante exiting and Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction stepping in for 1995's \\"One Hot Minute\\" led to poor sales and an uneven album. Like the Phoenix rising from the ashes (and the band had almost called it quits in '98, they returned with what was arguably their best album yet, 1999's \\"Californication\\". However, it was really 2002's \\"By The Way\\", spearheaded by Frusciante, that really showed the band's true strength and creativity. So, Frusciante is out again, and in steps Frusciante colleague Josh Klinghoffer. And now we have \\"I'm With You\\".<br /><br />At first listen, and then repeatedly listens, this album sounds like Flea. The bass weaves, throbs and thunders throughout, giving the Peppers their grooviest recording in some time. You can hear it on \\"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\". That delectable vibe that only Flea could come up with, and that signature RHCP sound. It's also omnipresent on \\"Factory Of Faith\\", which should have been the choice for the second single. But of course, this isn't what RHCP fans are really interested in. What they want to know is how does Josh Klinghoffer fill the giant shoes left by Frusciante? Well, for his first outing he plays it cool and subtle. In fact, I might not have known that Frusciante left the band, that's how sophisticated Klinghoffer's playing is. He utilizes the same textures and sonics as Frusciante. So, this begs the question: Will Klinghoffer grow as an artist and shine on future RHCP albums? That remains to be seen.<br /><br />There are many good tracks here like the two I mentioned above, but also \\"Brendan's Death Song\\", \\"Did I Let You Know\\", \\"Happiness Loves Company\\", \\"Police Station\\", \\"Meet Me At The Corner\\" and \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\". These eight are the best tracks here. The worst track has to be \\"Even You Brutus?\\" along with \\"Look Around\\" or \\"Ethiopia\\" or \\"Annie Wants A Baby\\". Still, overall, the band pulls out another decent album here when you listen to it front to back repeatedly. Not their best work, not their worst work, just holding steady. Which then begs the question: Do we need the Red Hot Chili Peppers, or have they gone past their expiration date? I still like them. I think they still have some mileage left as Irons, Flea and Kiedis hit 50 next year. Things could still get interesting, especially with Rick Rubin continuing to produce. The amazing thing about this band is they should have died and folded long ago. With all the drug addiction, in-fighting, record label pressures, band member changes, and lack of formal musical training, this band has somehow managed to withstand the test of time and appeal to many different music listeners. So, yes, there should be more to come.<br /><br />Here's how \\"I'm With You\\" compares with previous Red Hot Chili Peppers work:<br /><br />1984 Red Hot Chili Peppers: Two Stars<br />1985 Freaky Styley: Two and a Half Stars<br />1987 The Uplift Mofo Party Plan: Three Stars<br />1989 Mother's Milk: Three and a Half Stars<br />1991 Blood Sugar Sex Magik: Four Stars<br />1995 One Hot Minute: Three Stars<br />1999 Californication: Four and a Half Stars<br />2002 By The Way: Five Stars<br />2006 Stadium Arcadium: Three and a Half Stars<br />2011 I'm With You: Three and a Half Starsnk they still have some mileage left as Irons, Flea and Kiedis hit 50 next year.

0525423281|5.0|After reading Stephanie Perkins's Anna and the French Kiss, I immediately got Lola and the Boy Next Door. True, it's not a sequel, but I knew that if the writing were as good (and utterly delicious), I'd love it.  And boy did I.  Lola, a budding designer, has two wishes: she wants to wear a Marie Antoinette costume to her school dance and she wants her two dads to like her older rock star boyfriend, Max. While she works diligently at both, they don't seem to like Max. And things don't get easier when Cricket, the boy next door and Lola's first love, comes back into town. Now, Lola has to figure out who she is under all the costumes, and which great love she wants.  While not a sequel, Lola is a companion novel to Anna. Both Anna and St. Clair make appearances, working with Lola at a San Francisco movie theatre. (We learn that the couple is still very much in love, and planning a future together. A[...]) While they do have big parts, they're far from the focus, as this is Lola's story. And Lola is quite the character. Constantly in costume, she wears here feelings and emotions on her body, be it in wigs or outlandish dresses. She feels like herself when she's dressed up. She lives with her two dads (who were hands down my favorite characters in the book), who are both incredibly caring and overprotective (especially when it comes to her older boyfriend). She's a good student, a good daughter.  Except when it comes to Max, the bad boy rocker who loves her. Perkins does a great job of making him not someone you hate at first. He likes her, you can't hate him for that. But even though he isn't horrid, you still root for Cricket.  Cricket. The boy next door. The nice, sweet, patient guy. The inventor who has pined for Lola since childhood. Who leaves her messages on his window. Who helps her see who she is. Yes, he's that wonderful. His scenes with Lola are mesmerizing, and you just want to keep him for yourself.  In the background of Lola debating which guy she likes more, there's the story of family, where her birth mother is discussed. I like how Perkins added this story; it made the plot more developed, and less just a basic love story. I also love how the dads were just that - their sexuality was never a big problem or, even, plot point.  The book is adorable. The crushes are delightful, and the love scenes are drool-worthy. Seriously, if you liked Anna, pick this up. (You don't have to read Anna beforehand, but it's nice to.) If you haven't read it yet, get on it. Perkins tells a delicious, sugarcoated, fun story that left me captivated the entire time
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|While this book completes the Hunger Games trilogy, it unfortunately seems the author was rushed to finish. A great book, up until the last 6 chapters, where the authors writing style completely changes. This is one of the few books that I'm frustrated after reading, both because of the story's ending, as well as the difference in the author.
B005NKIQ26|1.0|Received the new album in the mail today, I ordered it for my little sister b/c she is a HUGE Justin Bieber fan and I wanted to listen to it to see what it's all about and I gotta say I'm disappointed. I enjoyed the Maria Carey song but thats' only b/c I already liked that song. She washed him out vocally. Boyz II Men were great as usual but that is about it. His voice is alot different but I just don't think alot of the songs sounded good. He murdered that Drummer Boy song and I think that was just a terrible idea especially feat Busta Rhymes (maybe there is a reason he doesn't do Christmas albums). Anyways I'm sure all of the Bieber fans will order it just because they are obsessed with him, but I honestly would rather save my money.

B000F0V0LI|5.0|This is John Wayne at his best.  The Searchers is the ultimate role for the actor and what a movie it is.  The excellent directed John Ford was at his best when he directed this movie and this is one of the 100 best films of all time according to AFI.  It is easy to see why.  A great plot that keeps the viewer interested from the opening scene to the last scene.  Great acting by awesome actors and actresses, beautiful landscapes, are just a few of the highlights of this movie.  The ultimate collection has alot of great things.  From production cards, commentary, and previews.  This collection is a must for any John Wayne, western movie fan.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

0446573019|2.0|Found that I had to persevere to finish this book. That is not usually the case with Baldacci's  books. The characters are wooden and the dialogue is stilted. The Kindle edition has over 70 chapters, a distracting device that took me out of the story. The protagonist, John Puller, is nearly a caricature of Jack Reacher. Will I read future David Baldacci books? Of course, except that I won't rush to pay 14.99 the day the book is published. Another book like this though will force me to remove Baldacci from my top tier of authors to my middle tier. Middle tier authors are good but not ones I await breathlessly for publication. Ones I can't wait for are Ted Bell, Jo Nesbo, Fred Vargas and  Andrea Camillieri  among others.

Okay for me since I have seen it all but the look on my baby's face when they KILLED a car (while chanting, \\"Kill him!\\"). \\"Mama, what did they just do to that car?\\" Guns and shooting throughout the whole film. Cars 2 left me feeling disturbed and unsettled, \\"Did I just show my children a murder?\\". I really wish I had previewed this cartoon prior to watching it with my children.

B004LROUW2|3.0|\\"1Q84\\"- A novel written by Haruki Murakami.  Mr. Murakami was born in Japan in 1949. Many of his novels have themes and titles that invoke classical music, such as the three books making up The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: The Thieving Magpie (after Rossini's opera), Bird as Prophet (after a piano piece by Robert Schumann usually known in English as The Prophet Bird), and The Bird-Catcher (a character in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute). Some of his novels take their titles from songs: Dance, Dance, Dance (after The Dells' song, although it is widely thought it was titled after the Beach Boys tune), Norwegian Wood (after The Beatles' song) and South of the Border, West of the Sun (the first part being the title of a song by Nat King Cole).  Murakami's fiction, often criticized by Japan's literary establishment, is humorous and surreal, and at the same time digresses on themes of alienation and loneliness. Through his work, he is able to capture the spiritual emptiness of his generation and explore the negative effects of Japan's work-dominated mentality. His writing criticizes the decline in human values and a loss of connection among people in Japan's society. \\"1Q84\\" (a reference to George Orwell's \\"1984\\") is seen as a \\"complex and surreal narrative\\" which \\"shifts back and forth between tales of two characters, a man and a woman, who are searching for each other.\\" It tackles themes of murder, history, cult religion, violence, family ties and love. (Excerpts from Wikipedia: Haruki Murakami).  The novel is of the science fiction/fantasy genre with sub-classes of mystery/murder, love story and erotica.  The novel \\"1Q84\\" is written using an anonymous narrator and by dialog from each character. Thoughts attributed to the character are denoted in italics. The story line is depicted from each character's point of view.  This is a departure from Murakami's previous first person narrative style. The original novel was written in three volumes; however, the English language addition is a composite of all three volumes. The events of the story take place in fictionalized 1984, with the first volume set between April and June, the second between July and September, and the third between October and December.  The story plot involves three main characters. Aomame, a lithe young woman who practices as a personal physical body trainer and part time assassin; Tengo a large mild mannered man who as a child math prodigy, now teaches math at a private school and is engaged in expanding his fledgling writing ability; and 17 year old Fuka-Eri, the daughter of \\"Leader\\" the head of a powerful religious faction called Sakigake. In the opening chapter we find Aomame trying to get to a very important meeting while her cab is stranded in traffic on an elevated expressway. While waiting, the cab stereo system is playing Janacek's Sinfonietta. Finally, in order to get to her meeting and at the suggestion of the cab driver, Aomame exits the cab and descends on an emergency stairway to the street level below. As she does so, Aomame enters 1Q84. In the second chapter, we find Tengo's book editor, mentor, Komatsu asking him to rewrite a manuscript submission in a literary contest from a 17 year old contestant, Fuka-Eri.  Fuka-Eri, who suffers from dyslexia, had dictated the story to her friend who transcribes the story and submits it in the contest. Komatsu recognizing that the manuscript had great potential convinces Tengo to become complicit in a plot to win the contest and promote a bestselling novel by \\"ghost-writing\\" the story titled \\"Air Chrysalis\\".  As the plot progresses, we find that the subject matter of \\"Air Chrysalis\\" appears to be a true story involving an alien power represented by the \\"little people\\"; that Fuka-Eri had escaped from the Sakigake compound and was being sought by its followers; and that Tengo and Aomame had once been classmates when they were about 10 years old and that some personal attraction was fostered by Tengo's attempt to protect Aomame from chiding from her classmates. All the characters now in the current reality penned 1Q84 by Aomame and all being pursued by Sakigake.  All in all I liked reading this novel. The writing was good, the characters were interesting and engaging and the plot was suspenseful. Reading all three volumes was a lengthy undertaking but was enjoyable non-the-less. On the down side, I thought the novel contained too much erotica; graphical sexual scenes, that didn't seem necessary to promote the story line or provide important character development. Had they been left out or attacked metaphorically, it would have served an equal purpose and probably shaved off several hundred pages. Also, the novel didn't stand up to a science fiction work as much as it did one of fantasy, for there was too many instances of unexplained variations in the plot operations. For instance Aomame has to enter the alternate reality quite dramatically, while Ushikawa and Tengo just seem to be there without much fanfare. Also, and this is a personal gripe, I really didn't see any necessity for what happened to Ushikawa; had he been simply detained all would have proceeded as planned anyway - but Murakami didn't ask my opinion when he was writing the book.  Of my three ratings, \\"Forgettable\\" - \\"Pleasurable-not memorable\\" - \\"Memorable\\" I would rate this novel Pleasurable-not memorable. I recommend you should add it to your reading list.

0553801473|2.0|If you are in the mood for something fresh and/or exciting and/or immersive, this book is not it.<br />At times, this book seemed almost contrived and skin-deep with padding out chapters and positioning characters for future plot developments.<br /><br />I read SF and fantasy books voraciously and generally find it easy to get immersed in the story.<br />For some reason, with this one, reading chapters was like channel-flipping through TV shows and never quite finding one to immerse you.<br /><br />I was left wondering quite often why I was reading about such uneventful minutiae and then the chapter would end.<br />With each new chapter I kept hoping for something to come along and draw me in but that never really happened.<br /><br />Books 1-3 were tremendous and very enjoyable for me -- I hope Martin can dig deeper for the next book and rekindle that past \\"magic\\" -- this one was just not up to par.

B0058VA2U4|3.0|I refuse to give 5 stars just cause it's Anthrax with Joey Belladonna.  The songs are overall are nothing extremely.  There are some that'll stick in my head, but Anthrax has been always the worst of the thrash metal bands.  They are the ones that made rap metal possible.  with respect to some bands like Rage against the Machine, Korn, and Body Count)  I'm keeping with it, maybe it'll grow on me more, but as of now, you all know it's a weak effort on their part.  They have done better than this even with John Bush.

B003XKB0RG|5.0|Big Break Records simply outdid themselves with this re-master of EW&F's 1980 double album FACES. The liner notes by Christian John Wilkane are masterful and include very informative interviews with Maurice White, Phil Bailey and Brenda Russell. The sound quality on this re-master is amazing.<br /><br />Musically speaking, for those who expected BOOGIE WONDERLAND were in for a surprise. In my opinion this album is richer musically and spiritually then I AM or ALL IN ALL. It definately takes a few repeated listens but boy does this album sound better with every listen. TAKE IT TO THE SKY is a richly melodic masterpiece that should have scaled the same heights as THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD. LET ME TALK, YOU, SPARKLE and BACK ON THE ROAD are all worthy of being hit singles and sound as timely and great today, if not more so, then they did 31 years ago.<br /><br />Because this was a double album released and a follow up to a multi-platinum I AM, expectations were high but Maurice White, Phil Bailey and company stayed true to who they are and delivered a highly spiritual and yet richly melodic record. While the album hit The Billboard Top Ten and LET ME TALK, YOU & AND LOVE GOES ON became major R&B hits, none of the singles reached the Top 40. FACES might have very well been years ahead of its time and lack of promotion of this project also probably contributed to the lack of commerical hits. None of that affects the music on this album. If you are a EW&F fan, this album is a must. The liner notes will make you appreciate this effort even more. I know I have fallen in love with this album all over again.<br /><br />Kudos once again to Big Break Records for a job well done. A very worthy re-master.

This is a doco at heart, so the repetition in action can be forgiven and anyway, there is somethng very contagious about young people completely immersed in the passion for a sport like this. - Those who frequent the slopes will just love this movie.  Personally, I'm a bit more into the technicalities of the movie making and am intrigued at the variety of shots captured in this work ... every angle covered it seems, and in startling clarity and ultra vivid colour. From a tech point of view, I find the editing generally excellent, with perhaps a tad overemphasis on those amazing slow motion bits which appear frequently, but again, in rock solid smoothness and clarity which reminds one that this is an extreme hi-tech production as well! The sound is also perhaps a tad \\"overbaked\\" here and there with huge LF Effects - even the lighting of a gas stove ring has to be accompanied by thunderous roar from the sub as the flame springs forth!  These are young editors who revel in the facility to blow everyones socks off with an armoury of precision digital video and audio techniques!  Enough said. If you love snowboarding, buy this movie!  And if you love mountain scenery in awesome colour and clarity ... buy this movie.  You will not be dissapointed.  MT
B000JQUZCI|5.0|This was a great book about everything from politics and society to scientific experimentation, and even about love.  I read it many years ago. I gave it to my children when they were 10 and 11 years old.  My son cried when he read it.  He said, \\"Mom, all he wanted was loved, and they killed him for it.\\"

B005KCGIUY|3.0|I think I know what Maynard was trying to accomplish and IMO he doesn't quite have the chops for it.  I love Tool, APC and the first two Puscifer albums so I'm fully aware of Maynard's projects and talents though I'm not a fanboy.  On this one I think he's over-reaching.  I don't think this album does the revisit to the 80s very well nor does it capture the ambient moods as it should.  If anyone wants to hear it done right I'd suggest Steven Wilson's 'Grace for Drowning'.  Maynard isn't in the same league with Wilson, so perhaps that's not a fair comparison.  IMO, Maynard should stay within his comfort zone.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I'm only reviewing this poop album to contribute to the low rating.  Anything more than 1 star is too generous.<br /><br />Lou Reed is not the Johnny Cash of Metal.  This album is an experiment that failed, plain and simple.  Metallica must be delusional in their belief that it is any good.  This album sucks.  It is garbage.<br /><br />Even die-hard Metallica fans are scratching their heads on this one.  St. Anger was Master of Puppets 2 compared to this.<br /><br />I find it hard for anyone to truly think this vomit sounds good. This is just a terrible sounding train-wreck.

0307454541|5.0|I waited forever to read this novel, as I had preconceived ideas about it and heard it was hard to get into. Well, wrong on all accounts.

B005J29HCQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm SO glad to have this music in an official release at last. But I'm very disappointed by the booklet that comes with the \\"deluxe\\" 2-cd set. Yes it's great to have all the lyrics - but don't those of us who shelled out nearly $30 deserve at least a nice booklet of the Frank Holmes drawings that were to accompany the original album, instead of some tiny little reproductions crowded on one page? the text content is pretty weak too - just some generic essays that say nothing. A little more technical information about the tracks and the process of putting them together would've been nice....
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|.....but I think this is a great album. It's been quite awhile since I have been interested in any new Metallica project although I do have respect for them for doing what they want and trying new things. A friend of mine from work brought this in and we've listened to it a couple times now and I am really into it. It is clearly a Lou Reed album, though he's got one hell of a backup band. This is way more listenable to me than St. Anger was. I still can't listen to that disc all the way through and I've lost interest in trying. I liked Death Magnetic quite a bit although it felt like they were trying too hard to recreate past glories. I don't view this as the new Metallica album, just a side project backing Lou Reed and as such, they rose to the occasion and made the best Lou Reed disc I've heard in quite some time. I find James' vocals really annoying however. They do not fit with the rest of album and I wish they were not there but luckily, it is not overwhelming on the album. If you're expecting a new Metallica album, pass on this as you will most likely be disappointed. If you're a Lou Reed fan, or more open to new things, give it a try. That's my 2 cents anyway. Thanks for listening. :)
B004VF68AQ|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars to balance out the negative reviews, contrary to what those naysayers are saying, this is absolutely Jane's... the sound, the lyrics, the voice, the only thing that's kind of missing is the rock guitar solos, but that's okay as Dave emphasizes more on the textures, and when there is a solo it is more  adding a new dimension to the song than being flashy and extravagant. Having said that I do wish there was some of that flash and extravagance. I thought some of the lyrics written by Perry were as brilliant as ever, and sort of make the songs better in a way. Case in point is the song called Twisted Tales, knowing the lyrics made the song come alive and mean so much more.   Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever liked Jane's, I really can't understand how some people who used to like their past stuff dismiss this as poor material as like I said above, everything Jane's Addiction is there sans the wailing guitars, although there is some wailing guitar in the last track Words Right Out of My Mouth which packs a decent punch. But that's not enough for me. And regarding the bass, yeah great bass lines used to drive and enhance or even make the songs in the past for this band but those days are gone and so is the player. That was 20 years ago and this is now. The bass on this album is good but normally I don't even notice, it's not the focal point and nor should it be. Only on Mountain Song, and the intro to Three Days. Bottom line is that I like how Jane's Addiction is sounding right now and that's what matters, to me anyway. And this disc is only 40 minutes long, short and sweet, and captivating.  Pros: Great lyrics, nice rich harmonic textures, catchy melodies and choruses (for the most part), classic Jane's sound updated, well worked key changes in songs   Fav. songs: Underground, Curiosity Kills (hint of Porno For Pyros in the verse), Irresistible Force, Twisted Tales, Broken People, Words Right Out of My Mouth  Cons: Album cover that I hide from everyone else, no guitar hero type of guitar solos, i.e restrained guitar playing, wish Chris Chaney played bass on more than one song, liner notes could have been more than just a small foldout with small fonts for lyrics which weren't even 100% accurate, could have had maybe one more song (where's Another Soulmate?), thought songs like Broken People and Words Right Out of My Mouth could have been longer  Weak Songs: End to the Lies, Ultimate Reason
B005J29HD0|5.0|I cannot contain myself about how awesome this release is.  They really took their time to get it right, so it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />First, they reproduced the album as close as possible to what the original release would have looked like (according to my humble research).  The b&w gatefold picture of the band is a nice piece of nostalgia.  Even the back of the jacket does not have a bar code!  They did this by inserting a paper clone of the back of the jacket between the jacket of the album itself and the outer plastic wrapper.  Once you remove both pieces, you have an album that looks and feels like a circa 1966/7 Capitol release.  Both labels are the classic \\"rainbow\\" design.<br /><br />Second, the inner picture sleeves are absolutely beautiful, right down to the font they chose to print the lyrics, which is identical to the font Capitol used for some of their 60s releases.  Yes, I do agree with one other reviewer who commented on how difficult it was to get the albums out of the sleeves, but for me it is was no biggie since I usually put my lps in plastic sleeves anyway.  One sleeve has a cool picture of Brian staring at an hour glass on one side and his liner notes/ essay on the other, which, yes, are bit revisionist, but that's ok: you know Brian was not going to talk about how unsupportive some of the band members were to the original project.  The second sleeve has the lyrics and credits.<br /><br />Third, it is the little things.  If you look carefully at the deadwax of Side One, you can see the words \\"Dumb Angel\\"--a reference to the original title of SMiLE.  On Side Two there's the touching \\"For Carl + Dennis.\\"  Nice details!<br /><br />How does it sound?  My copy was dead flat, quiet (thank the heavens!) and a joy to listen to.  I don't need to say anything about the music itself, because if you are buying the vinyl version, you know this is one of the greatest albums ever made or nearly made.  If you got the complete Sessions version of theVinyl, which from what I understand, does not come with the picture sleeves, you may have to drop another $25 for this one--it's definitely worth it.
0385534639|4.0|Erin Morgenstern's debut novel is, for me, full of strengths but not without a few faults as well.  Set in a non-traditional circus-you won't find a single clown or elephant here-the novel interweaves elements of the late nineteenth century fascination with the showman magician; immersive, theatrical creations; and a love story.<br /><br />The plot and setting are fairly simple to describe.  Two rival magicians rear and train two younger practitioners from childhood, one his daughter and the other an orphan, with the sole goal of their competing against one another in a battle of magical prowess.  One of the greatest producers of theatrical spectacles in their day is led by the elder magicians to create the incomparable Night Circus, which will act as the stage for the showdown.  Erin Morgenstern has a background in theater and dimensional art and it radiates through her circus.  Each tent, created in turn by the rival magicians, is an enchanted world unto itself and the circus goers aren't the only ones eager to enter the black and white canvas doors.  The reader can not help but be left breathless in awe at the intricate imagination of this talented writer.  Ms. Morgenstern creates an alternate reality of charm, elegance, and illusion, in turns coloring her black and white setting in tones of spellbinding beauty and somber foreboding.<br /><br />Two chronological threads are written into the novel.  In an interview, author Morgenstern states that she used this device to give a sense of mobility within the story, similar to the mobility of the circus itself.  I personally find it a bit confusing to keep straight, but as the two threads begin to converge it is easy to see why she used the structure: the reader feels tension building as you begin to wonder if the plot lines are heading for an ethereal commingling or a collision of catastrophic proportion.<br /><br />Short allegorical sections scattered between chapters provide a point of convergence between the circus theme and the story.  Once the reader realizes that these sections are glimpses at impending events, their significance becomes magnified in their role of foreshadowing.  In addition, these sections are used to lend a dreamy, sensory mood to the novel.<br /><br />There is romance here as well, and it enfolds itself quite naturally within the evolution of the tale.  At times fraught with tension and at others spun with delicacy, the passion between the two central characters is written with restraint and manages to feel wholly believable in a venue of suspended credulity.<br /><br />Despite all these strong points, I can not give this novel five stars for two reasons.  First, there is excessive use of tired metaphors and descriptive passages that bring to mind contrived examples from a grammar book.  Overwrought might be a good choice of adjective.  Yet in select passages Morgenstern's writing seems pitch perfect, such as this quote, which drew me in on page four:<br /><br />\\"The circus looks abandoned and empty.  But you think perhaps you can smell caramel wafting through the evening breeze, beneath the crisp scent of the autumn leaves.  A subtle sweetness at the edges of the cold.\\"<br /><br />Does that line not awaken your senses and make them tingle?  Overall it is my opinion that the originality and imaginative power of the novel more than compensate for the over-written sections.<br /><br />The second, and primary, reason that I can not give the book five stars is the ending.  All the loose ends are neatly tied up with a bow, which I appreciate, so that is not my issue.  My issue is that the ending is passed off to a character who I judge unnecessary to make the conclusion work.  I understand the role this character plays in the plot, and indeed in the structure, of the novel, but the large role the character is given at the book's climax seems contrived to me.  It almost has the sense of a movie part which was originally written fairly small, but the big namestar that is being wooed to play the role says that their name will only go on the dotted line if they get to star in the pivotal moment.  There are other players, in my opinion, who could have filled the role more believably.  I am not trying to say that this is one of those books where the ending is so disenchanting that the book is ruined.  Far from it.  There are a couple of clever twists, and the structure itself is good; I simply don't care for who Ms. Morgenstern chose to place center stage.<br /><br />This novel is recommended for all mature readers.  There is one sex scene and several instances of innuendo, but they are fairly restrained and I would not hesitate to allow my high schooler to read this work, despite being a rather conservative parent.<br /><br />I laud Erin Morgenstern's strong freshman effort, and though magical realism is not always my cup of cocoa, I will be on the lookout to snatch up a galley of her next novel.  This one I borrowed from the library, but it is going on my purchase wish list, as I foresee it becoming a personal \\"comfort book\\" and one I loan to friends in need of an escape.the dotted line if they get to star in the pivotal moment.

B001HN6922|3.0|When I first heard they were making a sequel to the 2006 Cars film I was surprised.  I liked the original film BUT is not at the top of the Disney/Pixar films.  For me, second to last just ahead of 1998's A Bugs Life.  Other films would have made for better sequels.  Perfect example 2004's The Incredibles.  You could have had a story there.  This story made no sense what's so ever.  We adults figured out the ending of who the bad guy or should I say bad car was  I will NOT say it here so there are NO spoilers in this review.  McQueen back in Radiator Springs.  Next race & he takes Mater & other with him.  BUT, the rest of the story.  2 time Oscar winner Michael Caine could have phones the voice work in on a role he can do in his sleep.  How stupid Mater is, breaking up friendships & pushing other fuels in a mess of a story that just did NOT make sense.  The positive I give to the video makers.  At least they released the DVD the same as the blu ray.  This TERRIBLE, I COMPLAIN ABOUT IT EVERY TIME IT HAPPENS, MISTAKE OF RELEASING A BLU RAY EARLIER THAN THE DVD, was not done here.  The DVD was NOT the plain jane silver ones Disney has been doing when they make those blu-ray earlier releases.  You get a real colorful DVD.    No chapter search list a mistake.  A few extras on it, nothing major.  But, when the film was disappointment.  Did  not live up to the expectations , since 2006 the Disney/Pixar releases have been coming out in May or June and did great business.  This one did come in first place for the opening weekend, but the final numbers.  When you see the film you will understand why still a hit movie it just was not normal Disney/Pixar material.

B005AUWY90|1.0|Cars, the first movie, was wonderful. Cars2 is loaded with violent acts, gasoline 'alcohol' consumption, cruel behavior, bad jokes and references to inappropriate adult material. All of this and visual splender is coupled with the cheesiest sound track I have heard in years.

I sincerely hope this sequel is not representative of what we will see from Pixar in the future.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I was getting ready to order a second pair of Sony MDR7506 folding headphones and checked out a few of the reviews for grins. Most of the knocks seem to be from people that have unrealistic expectations, or just don't have a clue. So here is the deal. These are pretty much the standard for 90% of the working professionals that do field sound, camera operation, live event mixing, film sound and ENG.  The other ten percent are using MDR V6. Next time your watching any 'behind the scenes' video, and there are shots of the boom operator, or a camera op, check out the headphones. These headphones are as ubiquitous as gaff tape on set. The 'phones are fairly light, and the minimalist flat design keeps them from getting snagged and knocked off if your moving around. The head band has just about the perfect tension balanced between a good seal/fit, and too tight and uncomfortable. The pair I use was bought in the mid-90's at Film Video in Denver, and has been on hundreds of gigs and are still going strong. Some folks complain about the material on the covers flaking off, but my pair is about 15 years old and no sign of that issue so far. Maybe later units had ear pads made from different material, or users are exposing them to things that are degrading the pads like excessive amounts of hair care products or leaving them laying out in direct sunlight when not in use. In any case the ear pads are replaceable, and there are aftermarket types that have a velour type cover for those that dislike the pleather factory pads. I like them so much I'm ordering a second pair to leave in my editing room so I don't have to dig mine out of the camera case, or risk forgetting them at the studio when going on a gig. Those that complain about 'lack of bass', don't understand that the job of a monitor is to be color-less, and not distort the sound. These headphones are about as flat, and accurate as you will get. You can spend twice as much, and not get much increase in real world accuracy,and most of those expensive headphones are too fragile to take into the field. If you want to hear your sound as it actually is, these are one of the best choices. If you want your sound muddied up with extra bass not present in the source, stick with 'phones pimped by some DJ or Rapper or that have some 'extreme' logo/name, you will be happier. If you want bullet proof, accurate, comfortable and best bang for the buck over the ear headphones, go with these. I would go with these over the higher priced Sony MDR-7509HD.<br />And for the guy whining about the amount of packaging these come in, get a life. That has nothing to do with the quality of the product, and completely worthless information for anyone looking for advice on headphones.
B003XMWSSY|2.0|First sentence, third paragraph, chapter 1 (\\"Presentation\\"):  \\"It is a shame that small - and easily preventable - surface errors can be determinants for an entire book, can premamaturely take you from being taken seriously.\\" Premamaturely??   Okay, with some writers that would be intentional and humorous. Or it may be the publisher's fault. Unfortunately, this sentence also has a sample of the real problem. Anybody who uses a word like \\"determinant\\" when they're not writing about mathematics is more than a little bit pompous.   This is not an easy or enjoyable book to read, and the advice seems to be pretty basic - more tips from Chapter 1 include \\"don't send an agent the only existing copy of your story\\" and \\"realize that Stephen King will have less trouble selling his next book than you will selling your first one\\".

I was a little worried that it might come with an older version of the BIOS that wouldn't support the new AM3+ processors.  When I got it, the case had a sticker stating that the it had the AM3+ enabled BIOS already. Also Amazon shipped the Rev 1.1 board not the 1.0 revision.  A few things note, the Windows 7 did not have drivers for the LAN, so you'll need to install them from the CD before you can get on the internet.  Also in order to get higher than 1333 for the memory, you'll have to mess with the BIOS settings.  Overall, I am very pleased with this board.

B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day has always been one of those bands that has periodically captured my attention but never really my imagination.  Their hit record Dookie arrived right at the tail end of my high school years and although I was enamored with it for a bit it didn't really make a lasting impact.  The thing was, there were others (The Ramones, for example) who had done the same thing only (IMHO) better.  Although the suburban boredom and generic disillusionment captured in some of the lyrics were relatable on a general level there was nothing that really grabbed me enough to shake me and not let go.  Dookie went in the proverbial dustbin after high school and I really didn't think much about Green Day for a while.<br /><br />Flash forward ten years and Green Day enters my radar again with all the publicity surrounding the release of American Idiot.  I had never imagined that Green Day would stay around that long let alone produce something that many consider a major artistic statement.  Although American Idiot didn't really do all that much for me, it did get me thinking that perhaps there had been more to Green Day all along than I had previously suspected.<br /><br />Hence I stumbled upon Warning, which I already find far more listenable than anything else I have heard from this band.  Although some of it is very highly derivative (\\"Warning\\" the song is basically a re-do of \\"Picture Book\\" by the Kinks with different lyrics) and the sound is largely monochromatic (mid-tempo Britpop), somehow it all gels.  Some reviewers identify this music as being \\"mature\\" and perhaps it is in the sense that it's not snotty teen-agst punk, but there is enough bite here to keep it interesting.  The band isn't trying too hard or attempting to do too much here and it suits them well, giving the music an easy and fun vibe that sounds like a bunch of friends having a jam session.  No big concepts or stabs at the commercial marketplace, just music.  As such, and in my biased opinion, this is where the band showed their greatest strengths.  Props to them for showing greater ambition, but this is the one I'll likely be listening to most often as the years pass.ir greatest strengths.

I read Pillars of the Earth on my Kindle, then ordered World Without End as a paperback.  The print was so small I couldn't enjoy it so I bought it for my Kindle and enjoyed it.
B0000542DJ|5.0|I relived the same moments JFK had.<br />And Oliver Stone saying that \\"JFK was never meant to leave Dallas alive.\\"<br />Not just chilling, but so bone-chilling that it took me a long time to sleep.<br />For sheer effect, it is on same par as Conspiracy [[ASIN:B00005YUO1 Conspiracy]] movie.<br />The way each fact is researched thoroughly, the rattling inside the team of DA, and Jim's reaction to Robert Kennedy's assasination, my God.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I bought all 3 books at a yard sale and read this one but it really wasn't that great. It was ok but didn't compare with some of the other best sellers out there. I will not be reading the other two I don't think.<br />Mandi
B005LZW9CG|5.0|this remastering by steve hoffman is / will be the sssential one for 2011. nice, well pounded sound, the LP and the label cd sound really muddied, low volume and no punch and clarity. 'i dont care anymore' the first track takes off and you can hear the drums power up...the really angry phil collins voice rings clear throughout..BUY IT....
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I loaded the free version and almost everything I wanted to do did not work. Wasn't sure if the paid version would either, but decided to throw caution to the wind and spring for the $1.49 Pro version. After a few minutes, I was transferring (wirelessly) files TO and FROM my Windows PC and a brand new 32 Gig MicroSD card that I bought from Amazon.com and delivered to me by Fedex TODAY  and installed in my Motorola XOOM TODAY (which was updated to HoneyComb 3.2 a few days ago). Things couldn't be much better. It has been a great week ! It all works great and I am sure glad to no longer have to search for the USB XOOM to PC cable !!! WiFi File Explorer Pro is an absolutely great program ! Buy it.....  you'll like it !
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|One of the most visually stunning movies. Everything was shot on-scene (no CGI) and it definitely shows. As well, the story was great, moving, all that. Definitely in my top 5 favorite movies.
B003U0AHBO|3.0|This movie had a lot of new additions to the story which seemed to be more of a set up for a part 2 rather than a complete story...
B005HJAOCS|4.0|There's a lot to like about this book.  The characters are painted very well and we really get to know and care for them.  The only thing I found confounding is what Emma really saw in Dexter.  His nonchalance, often spilling over to plain arrogance, seemed only to be a result of the fact that he was born into a wealthy family.  Apparently this carefree attitude and the fact that he was particularly handsome was enough to do the trick to woo many girls and launch Emma on a lifelong relationship with him.  Fair enough, there are people so shallow out there, but Emma is portrayed as being particularly intelligent and discerning, and few clues are really offered as to what it was about Dexter that she found so special.  This is the critical point of the whole story, so I would have given this five stars if this were fleshed out with more conviction.  To the book's merit, neither character was lacking in dimension, Dexter having his own set of increasing problems, and Emma overcoming some of hers .. a good arc with both.  I enjoyed the first two thirds of the book immensely as all of this was established with an often brutal honesty.  On the ending, I feel that the author may have struggled with the idea of how to finish it, and so took a bit of contrived out by what he has happen to Emma.  This then leads onto the retrospective view of the earlier parts of the relationship, where we learn in more detail how special the relationship between the pair was, and then onto the sweet ending that it is.  So it is a satisfying ending without a doubt, even if the lead-up to it niggled at me as being a little too convenient.  Funny, honest and worth reading.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|Pros:  You can't really beat $110 (plus currently 10$ off if you pair it with a Gigabyte Am3+ motherboard).  The other new AMD processors may have more cores, but the truth is, most applications currently used at home don't take advantage of the full potential of Quad core processors, let alone the 6 and 8 core processors.  To me, the added cost of buying those processors (or even any of the Intel processors) just isn't worth it right now.  This processor is by far the best bang for your money (for now at least) and if you are building a new computer or replacing an older one, then I would recommend this processor.  Cons:  This processor doesn't really perform all that much better that any of the Phenom II processors.  If you currently have one of those processors, I would not recommend upgrading to this (or any of the other new Bulldozer processors).  What little difference there is, would not be worth the cost.  I would wait for the next processors to come out (I think I am hearing April for those, but I'm not sure).  I am giving this one a 5 star rating because it delivers exactly what it advertises, a solid quad core processor at an exceptional price.  There are better processors available, but you will also have to pay a lot more for them.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This has turned out to be a very good (and easy) app to use. It does what it says and more in my case. I have been very pleased with CamScanner. This app has come in handy grabbing receipts as well as somethings from the newspaper's. I have also used it on magazine information (articles) to scan for future reference. I will most likely upgrade this app. Very pleased!
6304602944|4.0|i can't beleive they still haven't changed the title to its correct name, \\"Mango & Rash\\"??? this is a movie about 2 buddy cops who respect each other really but pretend they don't because they are such tough men. stallone plays \\"joe mango,\\" a great cop but he also runs a top greengrocer shop famed for its mangos (its just a coincidence that his name is mango as well!). russell plays \\"bill rash,\\" a grate cop but one who has a very sore rash on his leg that brings him grate shame. his mum tries to tell him its nothing to be frightened of but what bill hasn't told his mum is that he has secretly fallen for his rash and wants to turn into one big rash so that they can get married. joe realised his out of date mangos could be the answer to bills problems and well, i don't want to spoil the ending, but the the boys bond in a way that will melt your heart and make you question your own sexuality and love of rashes.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Excerpt from my review/blog located over  at ART OF THE STORY .COM<br /><br />I was expecting to love Melancholia and hate Tree of Life.<br /><br />Hate? Isn't that harsh?<br /><br />I've only seen one other Mallick film, and that was The New World. I have a policy of watching every film that has positive reviews to the end no matter what... After enduring through The New World I started to rethink my policy.<br /><br />The whole film is one long montage. I felt detached and indifferent to all the characters. Looking at the IMBD forums, I found that it's actually the style of Mallick. So I decided not to give his other films a chance but Tree of Life won the Palme d'Or so I was screwed. I was going to have to watch this film one way or another.<br /><br />Is it like Mallick's other films? With non-linear stories and montage after montage?<br /><br />It is exactly that.<br /><br />When Tree of Life was in wide release, several theaters put up warnings about the film's uncanny structure... Encouraging anyone to have an open mind going into the film and that refunds will not be given after 20 minutes.<br /><br />I hated The New World, but I was absolutely blown away by Tree of Life.... 6 years is a long time to produce a film and Mallick clearly didn't waste a second. Word on the street is that there's a new director's cut coming out that is 8 hours long.<br /><br />What's the story of Tree of Life?<br /><br />Not much of a story here.... the power of the film is how nostalgic it makes you. I have nothing in common with a childhood in Texas 1950 but Mallick managed to paint a beautiful portrait of all the dumb stuff we did as children but not just stuff but our limited view on the world and the process of losing innocence.<br /><br />Will I like this film?<br /><br />Depends.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've seen such polarizing responses to a film. People either HATE it or LOVE it... That's what happens when you try to rewrite the cinematic language.<br /><br />Normal films have scenes leading into scenes but Mallick chooses to show us a mosaic of beauty. Stuff just happens. There's a extended sequence in the middle of the film that has nothing to do with the story but does parallel the themes in several ways. It can be really jarring, just let go and relax. Make your judgement at the end of the film because you won't get anything like Tree of Life for a long time.<br /><br />Like poetry, it doesn't limit itself to the constrains of heavy exposition like novels. Poetry doesn't always make sense and it depends heavily on the individual experiences of the reader. It's the same case here, the film seems like a jumbled mess of scenes from his childhood and even the creation of the cosmos but the fact remains: there's something hauntingly beautiful about it.<br /><br />Not just gorgeous in the shallow sense of external beauty but beautiful in the living miracle of life... Seeing the childhood of our shy protagonist through Mallick's lens felt magical because this is a man who's constantly fascinated by the smallest nuances of life. The mammoth film tries to cover the entire scope of the human experience and it does a damn good job of it too.<br /><br />I think that any serious cinephile should experience this film, even if just for the originally of its cinematic language.<br /><br />Tree of Life is poetry.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|The device is a nifty design, and it is sleek and light.  Unfortunately, it was very, very buggy.  There were countless times where I had to stop the jog to reset the device.  Of course, 10 months in, the bloody device bricks on me.  I purchased from costco, so I was lucky.  Do not purchase this product.  The software builds are not up to par for the price paid.  I recommend the garmin app for the android/iphone.  It has the same functionality, or at least nearly the same, and it costs 1 percent of the price.

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN SCIENCE THEREFORE I FOUND SEVERAL THINGS IN THE BOOK THAT I WAS FAMILIAR WITH AND ENJOYED READING THEM FOR THE REVIEW AND THE WORDING OF THE MATERIAL MADE FOR A VERY ENJOYABLE READ.  THERE WERE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT WERE EXPLAINED IN GREAT DETAIL, THINGS THAT I HAD ONLY A FAINT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY WORKED UNTIL I READ THIS.  THE BOOK IS PERFECT FOR PEOPLE OF ANY AGE.  YOU CAN ENJOY READING THIS BOOK ALONE OR SIT AND READ IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN, OR GRANDCHILDREN.  YOU AND THEY WILL BE RICHLY REWARDED.

B004IDYK0G|5.0|I had heard a couple of their songs from their first album on the radio.  Especially liked \\"Breakeven\\" and \\"The Man Who Could Not be Moved\\".  With this second album, I loved the song \\"Nothing\\" so much and also thought \\"For the First Time\\" was great, so I decided to buy the album and see what else they have to offer.  Wow, is it amazing! Danny's soulful singing style and great melodies and lyrics have me putting this CD on constant replay.<br />If you like the style of the songs that have gotten radio play, you will love this sophmore album!  I now love the title track, \\"If You Ever Come Back\\", and \\"Walk Away\\".  I am kicking myself that I did not figure out how great they are before they toured this summer in the states.  I am sure their popularity will continue to increase and I won't have the chance to see them in a smaller venue again.<br />Oh well, they are that great and they deserve all the success they have!!!
B005JLN9Z8|4.0|First off let me say, these guys ARE NOT your typical heavy metal genre rock band.  The 80's \\"C@ck R@ck\\" genre likes of Ratt, Crue, Skids, GnR, Slaughter, Halen, Guns, Jovi, Leppard, Riot, Sister, Snake, Lion and Poison abviously created this band (Steel Panther) and we should all thank them for their years of debatchery, drugs, fun, and mayhem.  Steel Panther is doing one thing those bands never did, promote all of the Shenanigans those bands did!  And to that I salute them.  As for this record, I've seen these guys twice (as Steel Panther and Metal Skool) and I have to say these guys play better and perform better than some of those original bands.  Sure, they might milk the genre and play it up a bit like dum-funny-drug-n-sex addicted morons, but that's who they are (or at least what they pigeoned-holed themselves into), and it's ironicaly perfect.  If you put the lyrics on hold and listen to the production of the songs it's probably better than 80% of the 80's bar none!  So, this album....is it Feel the Steel quality?  YES!  Musically?  YES!  Lyrically?  Sort-of (probably more vulgar, which might not appeal to some as they might have been looking for more a serious style, but would that be Steel Panther?  Lyrically?  Sort-of (yes I repeat myself on purpose) So....lyrically this record is more satirical (is that a word?)....anyway, throughout the record there are stabs (jokes) towards people in pop-culture like; Tiger Woods, Vince Neil which is clever as no band I know of does this.  As for the sexual innuendoes....OMG! they put it in, but no need since they blow it up with songs like \\"Let me come in\\" and \\"it won't suck itself\\" if those two songs don't make you wanna buy the record alone then you don't need this music, but let it be said you'll be missing out!  My view; clever production, Feel the Steel was stellar, Balls Out, definately DOES NOT suck!  If you're the type that's like; \\"Aw the 2nd record syndrome\\" don't worry this is one of few (and I mean FEWWWW)2nd record releases' that does NOT suck.  It's typical Panther, which I think is awesome and though I woud like to see a serious record in the future, part of me doesn't want that.  Why, you might say? Because who's going to pick up the slack and play the FUN SEX n DRUG addicted music?  NO ONE, and that's why Steel Panther is alive and on this planet!  They're friggin Supersonic Metal Machines!  Well, there you have it...oh one last thing.  This record is great if you wanna piss-off your lady! Or if you're pissed off at your lady you can play this too, and I'm sure it will help you get even. There happy listening.  I have to run....I have a party to get ready for, it's \\"Tomorrow Night.....Tomoooorrow Night!\\"

0446547654|3.0|I have read every book and loved most of them.  What I love and most people love about Nick is his ability to talk about the characters they become believable and you can relate to them.  He is also good at striking emotion from his reader.  It is no different in this book you love the characters, you love the sceans, you can't help feel like you too are falling in love.  He doesn't let you down there.    However,  this book becomes predictable.  I think we are looking for the long love story from Nick.  I want a book with not a ton of struggle and death but a book about love with strong characters and emotion.  if you love Nick and have read his books in the past you know the style. If you never read his books you will love it.  Although this isn't my favorite I will read his next novel.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|As a dedicated devotee to the Reacher series I freely admit I will buy and read anything Child puts in print. With that bias admitted, The Affair lands fairly far down on the rankings list.  Although the \\"how it all began\\" was a great launching point, the story was less than engaging and to be brutally honest a bit out of character for what you would expect from Reacher.  The Reacher we have come to enjoy has always been the highly intelligent giant who can take care of himself in any situation.  In The Affair, Reacher was judge, jury...and most disturbingly executioner, and on more than one occasion I found myself thinking certain events in the storyline were totally non-Reacher.  Reacher has killed a lot of bad guys, but he does not murder them especially when they are unarmed...a fine literary line that Child crosses.

1400032717|4.0|There defiantly is something special about this book. I've never read anything quite like it. Hoddon's severely autistic main character, Christopher narrates with a striking combination of literal observations, misinterpretations, dramatic irony, and involved tangents about maths.<br /><br />The story begins when Christopher finds the body of his neighbor's poodle, stabbed with a garden fork in her front yard, but, as in the original \\"curious incident,\\" the dog is somewhat incidental, a clue and a catalyst, rather than the heart of the story. The \\"murder\\" of the dog inspires Christopher to write a murder mystery about the crime for school, leading to conversations with neighbors, confrontations with his father, and eventually, the uncovering of a much larger truth about his own life, and the people close to him.<br /><br />The work does have it's challenging moments. Christopher is a prickly character, at times difficult to like, but his novel and intricate voice keeps readers engaged. His frustrated and overworked parents are similarly difficult to empathize, though the difficulties inherent in raising Christopher do make them a bit more sympathetic. The novel decrescendos in a rather rushed style, wrapping up all the loose ends in a way that makes the author's hand show a little too clearly.<br /><br />Overall, however, I found this a fascinating, original novel.

That said, I had a difficult time using disks from another computer for Windows Server installation and enabling RAID on both the Marvel and AMD controllers at the same time results in a warning that too many option ROMS are enabled and will cause a conflict, making only one of them usable.  Overall performance is good, but setup is not as straight forward as it should be.

B000WC3864|5.0|Evil Dead(released Oct/81)aka Book of the Dead....wow,what legs this film has grown.Made on a very modest budget of well under 1/2 a million dollars,and now said to have grossed somewhere around 30 million(!),this film has taken its gory place amongst its' followers high on their respective film lists.Of course as we all know this was the film Robert Tapert,Sam Raimi(later of Xena & Hercules,and Bruce Campbell all cut their filmic \\"teeth\\" on and the rest is history.The film itself deserves no more than about 3 1/2 stars,being a just above-average flick.I am no fan of Anchor bay but they have put together a three -disc set here,worthy of say a Criterion company release;but more on that later.<br />The plot as we all know by now involves a couple of guys with girlfriends and a sister tagging along,who all decide to head out into the remote woods to a cabin.There they find a tape recorder and a strange notebook(that we all come to know is the Necronomicon).They play the tape recorder and find it has the voice of a professor on it,and as he chants some ancient words it arouses spirits in the woods that slowly but surely attack the cabin and everyone in it.One by one the girls and eventually one of the guys all become Deadites and attack Ash,who remains the only one still standing and possession free throughout the movie.But Ash has his work cut out for him(literally and figuratively)as he has to kill each one of his friends.The spirits make it clear they want EVERYONE(\\"join us\\") and at the end,as Ash stands alone outside the cabin,the strange entity comes at him in a head long rush as he screams into the lens...fade to black.<br />I recall the movie originally and it was quite the gorefest when it first debuted.It certainly looks tame now,as have alot of its contemporaries.They had lightened the rating system I recall in the early 70s so things got a little bit more intense,if that's the word,on screen.Filmmakers really started to push the envelope.What was rated \\"R\\" back in the 60s is now about PG today;it's amazing(the times they have a-changed!),but I digress.The special effects,as primitive as they were for the late 70s,still stand up pretty good today.Raimi and company made the most of what they had and used every trick in the book to convey that sense of isolation,dread and horror that became the trademark of the Evil Dead series.Bruce Campbell of course as Ash really makes the movie,as he goes from a very wimpish type character and converts into a much stronger one,due to the forces that he is pitted against.It's do or die and Ash doesn't want to die as his friends did.The rest of the cast do an admirable job and while it is no Citizen Kane,Campbell and company manage to pull it all off pretty well.<br />Technically speaking the film,though shot in 16mm,looks and sounds very good in these prints.It was originally shot full frame so Anchor Bay has gone and included BOTH the full frame AND widescreen prints here for your edification!Each disc has extras and the third is dedicated to nothing but extras.They include:Commentary on the widescreen print by the directors,commentary on the full frame version by Campbell,poster and memorabilia gallery,trailer and TV spots,make up tests,featurettes about the women of the Evil Dead,Campbell and Ted Raimi WITH the women of E/D,discovering E/D,a premiere in 2006 at a Drive In w/ the full cast,the cast at a convention,a reunion panel AND a replica of one of the original theater posters thrown in for good measure.Phew! As I said this is a release worthy of the Criterion company and as such that is why the high marks;as they just put the whole package right over the top.<br />All in all a highly recommended release for fans of the first of the three of this gorefest series.Though not the best it's still pretty darn good and it still has some scare the pants off of you moments throughout.This edition has both the original full frame print and the specially made widescreen print.And with allthe extras,there is NO other version to get the Deadite of your choosing.Join us!is NO other version to get the Deadite of your choosing.Join us!
B000002KY8|5.0|This 2 set lp was what made the royal purple musician a superstar.  It brought in a audience which was no longer limited to black and punk rock fans and it introduced Prince to the newly founded MTV generation (this lp made Prince the first African American artist to have a video on MTV with his video for \\"Little Red Corvette\\").  1999 was up against Michael Jackson's Thriller, Lionel Richie's self titled debut lp, Luther Vandross' For Always, Forever For Love lp, and Marvin Gaye's Midnight Love lp of which were the top selling black/pop records by the end of 1982, but it managed to stay on top with them in a unique way with hit songs like the funky title cut, the rockabilly \\"Delirious\\" and the dark and scandalious \\"Little Red Corvette.\\"  Videos for \\"Little Red Corvette\\" and the title cut were very cutting edge for MTV although they were conceptual clips of which was cost efficient for the 80s.  Other great songs that were'nt singles were \\"Automatic,\\" \\"DMSR,\\" \\"Something In Water Does'nt Compute,\\" and \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" which were radio friendly hits and more than superior fillers.  The latter two were better for singles than \\"Lets Pretend We're Married\\" \\"Lets Pretend We're Married\\" was made into a video that MTV did'nt play due to the fact that did'nt \\"fit in with the standards\\" of the new cable program.  The problem with MTV was that it was afraid of trying something new and that was playing a video by a African American artist.  They had very few black artists on their station by the end of 1982, but since they did'nt record R&B music and were not American, they were deemed \\"unthreatening\\" to MTV.  Once upon a time, the station gave \\"Little Red Corvette\\" and \\"1999\\" a test and then quickly withdrew it from their playlist.  Then the king of pop and CBS records gave MTV an ultimatium they would never forget if they did'nt stop rejecting black videos (that included \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Beat It\\").  Maybe a partylike anti-politic song like \\"DMSR\\" and \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" amonga few others kind of symbolizes what was going on in the music industry in 1982 (including MTVs racist policies).  Most of these songs mainly encompasses a plead for a \\"utopian society\\" and what was a better way to get closer to it than Rock N' Roll, Minneapolis style!  Prince was a risk taking musical genius that did'nt take crap from anyone.  I respect artists that keep doing their thing no matter what tries to stand in their way and 1999 (along with Dirty Mind and Controversy) proves to be one of them.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|I cannot tell anyone enough how much I love this series. The characters, I will never forget!  Christian Grey and Ana are soul mates. I have read a lot of romances and I have to say, this book will be forever on my mind and I will recommend this book to everyone one of my friends. It is the most original story. It's shocking, sexy, mysterious, sad, exciting, hot,funny and beautiful. Christian Grey's life is so ODD, but you can't help but love him and cheer him on to better himself.  I loved Ana's inner Goddess and her inner subconscious. Very funny how the author describes what they do inside her head.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Have you watch ABC's Castle TV Series? The TV series is about a novelist who wrote about a fictional character, Nikki Heat based on Detective Kate Beckett. Heat Wave is consider a spin-off from the TV series itself. There are a lot of similarities between the TV series and the book. If you like either one of them, you should catch the other too.<br /><br />Detective Nikki Heat was assigned to investigate on the murder of property developer Matthew Starr who apparently dropped from his 6th floor condo. Journalist Jameson Rook was along tagging along with the squad for research for his piece. The story keep you guessing the suspect from his trophy wife, financial advisor to the doorman.<br /><br />The crime story is not deeply engaging and doesn't take itself seriously, but I will recommend this for those who are looking for something light-hearted to read. This is a funny and witty story that carved to develop up both the main characters for future stories. If you like this, don't forget to get the sequel, Naked Heat and catch the TV series `Castle'.
1612130283|5.0|This book was hard to put down. Christian Grey is the tortured hero and Ana is his perfect match.

Excellent job by this author on knowing how to grasp on to your emotions, thoughts and even to make me look up music that was described in the book.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|Regardless of the accuracy of this film in portraying actual events, the film is an interesting viewing experience. The portrayed view of these entities, whether interpreted as \\"alien\\", i.e. extraterrestrial, or terrestrial inter-dimensional beings, i.e. rebellious angels (\\"Nordics\\") with some of their works (\\"Greys\\"), is probably more accurate than the goofy, spindly creatures portrayed in CE of the 3rd Kind. Largely, these entities don't exhibit characteristics of benign beings as the late Dr. Karla Turner and others have indicated. * \\"Night Skies\\" is another terrifying film in this genre. \\"Fire in the Sky\\" is a well-acted film portraying a horrifying experience. No sane person should desire such an encounter.  * Kidnapping (\\"abduction\\") is NOT a benign act

B003VANOFY|1.0|I'm usually very satisfied with Logitech products, but this item is the exception.  It is well made, but there is an issue with the wireless connection that I cannot solve.<br /><br />It worked fine for the first week and then the signal would drop and I would have to reset the wireless dongle to get it to work once more.  While not the most convenient solution, it worked this way for another week or two until today.<br /><br />Now it seems that even a reset is ineffective at connecting the signal.  For those curious - I do not have a wireless router or any other wireless devices in my home so interference is a non-issue.  I did see that other recipients of this product have had the same problem after reading the Logitech Forums, however, it seems that there is no response from Logitech directly in any effort to solve this problem for their customers.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that this one experience has put me off of as a Logitech customer, but I would strongly caution those considering purchasing this headset.  Until the whole wireless interference (or whatever it may be) is solved, I'll reluctantly be staying with wired headsets.
B005UT29Z0|4.0|The forces that took the nation over the financial edge and into the great recession are no more complicated than human greed.  They operated on every level from people buying more house than they could afford (the main culprit), to politicians and banks facilitating and encouraging riskier and riskier financial endeavors.<br /><br />To keep the farce alive and running, Wall Street took the reins and ran with the money.  Everyone seemed happy as long as the money kept rolling in.  Though the financial underpinnings were never sound, things just kept rolling along.  Why rock the boat?<br /><br />This required a lot of looking the other way by political leaders and denial on the part o the general public.  No one should be surprised that the house of cards came tumbling down.<br /><br />This movie is about the beginnings of the crash (fictionalized) and how a financial tsunami begins.  This drama delivers some fine performances from Zachary Quinto, Demi Moore, Keven Spacey, Paul Bettany, and Jeremy Irons.  It gives faces and form to what could prove to be a financial Apocalypse that could leave the nation in ruins, only time will tell on that front.<br /><br />From a business standpoint we see the forces that drive the decisions to cut one's losses and take it on the chin, survival for survival's sake.<br /><br />We also see moral and ethical struggles which ultimately succumb to going along with the crowd, despite the consequences.<br /><br />The movie is a look at a small piece of a big puzzle, and the issues that it required the players to face, and their ultimate failure at dealing with them.<br /><br />What works for me about this movie is that it's a beginning of putting the great recession into context, and getting us to take a look in the mirror to see our part in all of this.<br /><br />The question is:  can we be honest with ourselves?
B0034PJWJ8|5.0|This film is great! Never a dull moment in the history of maximum R&B.  This retrospective is so fast moving, that it leaves you begging for more.   The Who are the original punks, and this movie showcases how seriously funny,and uber-talented these music personalities are and where.

B00368PSN2|4.0|Okay, you can read the rest of the reviews and know this flick had a VERY nice cast. I saw it on Sy-Fy channel tonight. So at first I was thinking, `Wow, WAY better than most Sy-Fy channel crap movies. Almost too good to be true. What surprised me was, for a film that never saw the light of day in theaters, the cast was great, the CG was excellent (especially the CG creature...very very nice), and the special effects (blood spurting from beheaded bodies etc). Nice twist (SPOILER) that the hero was not from our planet, and had landed here in the Viking era. Soundtrack was good, and had nice build-up to the `anxiety' scenes. Downfall for this film was the script was totally `Hollywood', and you knew every line, and every scene progression before it happened. Very much an `Alien' or `Grendel' clone. STILL, I gave it 4 stars because the cast was superb (not a bunch of B actors) and I HAD to pause it when I went to the bathroom so I wouldn't miss a minute.<br /><br />Yeah I know I didn't go into great depth about plot and such, but if you read this post, you've most likely read the others and know all the in-depth juicy. I just wanted to post my two cents worth.<br /><br />This is much worth a rental. CHEERS!
B00005ATZT|5.0|Nothing to add to the many reviews of this successful picture, save that it is no flash-in-the-pan. It looks as good today as when it was first to be seen, as a first run movie, on television, and, then, on disc. The chase for an innocent man, seeking only to prove his innocence, is right up there with the best, although not the best among them. Ford is perfectly cast as the hero without &#34;side&#34;, without the arrogance of a man of achievement, without the loss of humanity, to which nature predisposes any person in his situation. Repetition has taken some of the luster off the Award winning Tommy Lee Jones performance; he still fits the bill, pretty well, in the role of man-hunter. There is enough action to keep up the pace and more than adequate acting skill, by the supporting cast ably to reinforce the stars performance. Those who have never seen the movie, and who like action thrillers, should enjoy this one.  Those who have not seen it for some time, should be able to see it again with almost all the initial pleasure.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I was priveleged to be an extra with many others and went to the pre-screening of this film...WOW is all I can say! The story line was intriguing and the characters were spot on in their performance! I am only disappointed that it wasn't in theatres longer because it is definitely a movie to see. Nolte, Hardy,Edgerton, & Morrison did an excellent job and I do hope there is a sequel that expands this story as I didn't feel the movie had really ended!

B000T45C32|5.0|This movie could be boiled down to today's ideals, talent = greatness. Two of the main characters who were genetically superior found themselves at a disadvantage according to their superior genes, they didn't want something near as much as Vincent because they were given more and had less to prove... kind of. It's one thing to be a failure, it's another to be a failure with everything going for you.  It's a touching movie and as far as sci-fi goes, it is, in my opinion, one of the better.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is a phenomenal result of source material, strong thematic elements, and amazing set design. Fan of comics or no, the Norse mythology is in your face, and the world suffers not for the god's attentions. Despite the difference in themes and settings, you are caught in the epic-ness and are given just enough time to get carried away with it. And maybe a bit longer for you to enjoy an epic in a quiet New Mexican town.<br /><br />The characters and plot are point for point stories that have happened in the comics throughout the ages. Arrogant son defies father, younger brother manipulates the favoured son. The most amazing thing happens - it feels real.<br /><br />While we're along for the ride, the BD contains a number of featurettes from casting to props (esp. the Hammer), make-up, music (my least favourite aspect of the film) and settings. Unfortunately, this series of behind-the-scenes comes across a bit of a forced hand. Stan Lee is featured a bit in the featurettes, and that's awesome. He actually is shown walking and talking alongside the cast and crew. There is an Avengers teaser, which is not really anything special of any sorts. The deleted scenes are, for the most part, not deserving of the cut. The first of these is the best - featuring a close look at the brothers Thor and Loki and their close relationship. You get a real sense of camaraderie between Thor and his fellows (and Sif, too). Personally, I'd throw the lot of them back in the film and suffer the added length with a smile.<br /><br />Once again, I write this review as listening to the director commentary. So I'll come back and edit for those points later.<br /><br />For now, the BD is as epic as the titular character himself. That's pretty mighty....
0307593312|3.0|I enjoyed this novel very much. The bulk of the book centers on Aomame's quest to find Tengo, the love of her youth. This provides much of the dramatic tension in the second half of the novel. The problem is that Tengo is a public figure and Aomame could discover his whereabouts with some of the detective resources at her disposal. A telephone book or some other inquiry could easily resolved this issue and saved 200 pages.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|What a remarkable movie.  I know I've always wondered what went onto behind the scenes in the lives of royalty and the King's Speech gives us a wonderful view.  It's said in legends that a wounded hero is the only one who can save us, and that's exactly what happened during WWII with King George IV, or Bertie as his family called him, and Lionel Logue, a speech therapist.<br /><br />The King's Speech: Road to the Throne, tells the story of King George the IV, who must take over the throne because Edward VIII wants to marry Wallas Simpson, which would render him ineligible to rule.  Considering how courageous Bertie was in first overcoming his stuttering, and then going on to lead England through a vicious war, I think Wallas did the English people a favor.  From what I saw of the movie, Edward appeared to a mean-spirited man, more interested in his creature comforts than anything else.  One might speculate that he uses his infatuation with Wallas to get out of doing the work of being a king.<br /><br />This is the story of the friendship between two men, and how a fraud saved a country.  Lionel didn't have the degree it was assumed he had, but to his credit, he never claimed to be a doctor. What he did claim was that he could help Bertie and he did.  Lionel probably gave Bertie the first unconditional he'd ever had in his life.  I don't begin to know what might cause stuttering, but I do know that Edward's constant teasing of his little brother's affliction couldn't have made it any better.<br /><br />The movie shows us what it was like for Bertie as a man, to be afflicted with the one thing that he can't have, if he wants to give courage to his nation during war times.  Lionel gives Bertie the courage to reach beyond his fear, and to rise up in order to save his nation, to show the most important role a ruler must live, and that's to give his people a role model when they've lost heart.<br /><br />As a movie, both the role of Bertie, played by Colin Firth, and the role of Lionel, played by Geoffry Rush, are played superbly.  Firth brings such a vulnerability to Bertie, that to see him rise up to meet his challenges is wonderful.  Rush plays Lionel with just the right combination of dignity and playfulness, skillfully walking the edge of innate brilliance and madness.<br /><br />It took me a while to see this movie because, frankly a story about a king with a stutter than the guy that fixes him, sounds boring the extreme.  I'm so glad I took the time to watch it, and really only because of the awards and great reviews it received.  It's a movie that stay with me for a long time.role of Lionel, played by Geoffry Rush, are played superbly.

0385535139|4.0|Of Star Jones, \\"I Am a Lawyer\\" and stay away from most novels about Trials and Law like Typhoid. Even non-fiction usually doesn't capture the tedium and terror of practicing Trial Law [though \\"A Civil Action\\" was wonderful]. However after reading a review of this I thought it would be fun, and it is. Some truths some exaggerations but on the whole a good read and not too ridiculous like most \\"Legal Thrillers\\". Although, it is  about Civil Litigation it reminds me of the movie \\"In Justice for All\\"  in that it's way over the top , but actually replicates  the feel of the  insanity of the  \\"Justice System\\" , Good job Mr. Grisham.
0440241901|3.0|This was a very fun chick lit book! Can You Keep a Secret is highly readable if you're looking for something fun and light. I fell right into it and chuckled as Emma revealed all her secrets to the man sitting next to her on the plane. When Emma returns to her work and learns this man is the new CEO, she is horrified. My jaw dropped when he revealed all her secrets on national television. I kicked back and enjoyed the rest of the story, waiting to see how it would unfold and what would happen in Emma's life. It was a light and fun read.

1451648537|5.0|In many ways this book reminded me of that best selling account of a son's recollection of his father's vile diatribe, which Amazon will not allow me to post its title, but substitute \\"stuff\\" and you will know which book I am talking about: \\"Stuff My Dad Says\\".   The ever opinionated and intolerant Jobs was similar to dad in that book. While it is obvious that the \\"victims\\" of Jobs demeanor probably don't or didn't share my viewpoint, these traits are what allowed the guy to accomplish what he did. He realized he had no time or patience for mediocrity, something unfortunately this country has learned to embrace and even in Jobs political views, while still a supporter of Obama, had no patience for.  I found his character fascinating and the book so compelling I couldn't put it down. The real sub-plot is obviously the opposing visions of Gates v. Jobs, an obvious spin for future movies, books and historical projects that will live for ages just as their accomplishments will.  What I find so enlightening about this book is how, arguably the most successful inventor/entrepreneur of our time, used such politically incorrect methods to achieve that success. He was a throwback to a better time in America when demanding excellence came first. He was a rare breed and despite all his flaws, those who rose above the rest, recognized why the need for The Jobs Way if they were going to succeed. Not everyone can be a leader, not everyone can be top dog and while opinions count, it was obvious to Jobs, that the buck stopped with him.   A great read and great lesson for today's politically correct America.
B001CISHU4|4.0|I am overall satisfied with this item. I bought this for my fiance as a Christmas present. I looked at the package when it came and everything seemed to be in order. I bought it used and wanted to make sure that the condition was good enough. It was in even better condition than I thought it would be. The dics had no scratches on it what so ever. It looked like a brand new CD. It came in its original casing and had the little book that CD's come in. The reason I only gave it four stars is because of how slow this shipping on it was! It felt like forever for it to arrive at my house. It seems like it will play just fine since there are no scratches on it. Overall I would recommend this item. As long as you dont mind having to wait almost a month for it to arrive. Im glad I ordered it when I did and not a month before Christmas. I would recommend this item even if you could only get the used edition. I think my fiance will be thrilled when he opens this on Christmas morning. I cant wait!

0525423656|4.0|As a middle school teacher, I read books like this for pleasure, easy reading, and to keep up with what my students are reading. I discovered Matched by accident as I purchased several similar books. Matched was slow to start and it wasn't until you saw some character development that it seemed to be intriguing and catch my attention. I followed through the book though and gave it my stamp of approval for students to read (I still feel awkward suggesting books with these love triangles recently - Twilight, Hunger Games, even a little of Maze Runner).<br /><br />**Some spoilers - be aware**<br />When Crossed arrived I was excited! I couldn't put it down! I enjoyed the different views of Ky and Cassia. In my opinion the author switched characters at the perfect timing to get their point of view on a situation - even when they were together. I loved the authors descriptions of the landscapes. The imagery was wonderful. The metaphors helped me picture very clearly what things looked like and even the character descriptions seemed to improve, in comparison to Matched. I will agree that I thought Xander would play a larger role, but his role is minimal (if that). Ky and Cassia have adventures of their own with new companions that they pick up along the way. There becomes more questions about characters backgrounds than answers. You learn a little more about Ky and his upbringing only to discover that there is so much more he has not told. Xander has secrets even though his part in the book is less than a chapter. Tension rises when Cassia seeks to join the rebellion and Ky wants to avoid it and the Society (even though some believe he is the Pilot). In the end, love overpowers their own desires and Ky follows Cassia to the rebellion only to be sent away from her... again... what a surprise!<br /><br />The book ends several month later with Cassia in one place and Ky in another. Cassia has received a message to meet someone we are not told who... guess I'll have to read the third one to find out...<br /><br />Overall... I feel there was a lot of growth in writing style between this and Matched....   Overall... I feel there was a lot of growth in writing style between this and Matched.

1451648537|3.0|This book grabbed me at the beginning, and sufficiently held my attention to finish it. While it offers fascinating insights into Steve Jobs' life, and even though it explores many facets of his complex personality, the accounting of it was completely emotionless. Like a person without any feelings telling you what they literally see in front of them, without further analysis, or any other intellectual or psychological curiosity. The book also seemed to be biased against Steve Jobs, to a fault. The overall message is that \\"Steve was a jerk, and a genius\\" - in that order.   I think the biographer tried to cover up his bias by stating at the beginning of the book that he liked Steve Jobs, but it's quite apparent throughout the book that the biographer despised Steve Jobs. While he cites objective facts like, \\"He [Steve] cried\\" - his mention of that one trait page after page intentionally casts Steve as weak, immature and temperamental - the reader is meant to come out with the impression that Steve was emotionally manipulative. End Stop.  No further exploration. The author continues to try to hit this home (Steve is jerk) even during the latest stages of Steve's very painful illness, during a time when I don't think it's remotely fair to judge anyone. It feels disgraceful - like a bitter relative standing giving a contemptuous eulogy at a funeral, particularly given that Time chose to release this jarringly close to Steve's actual death. For a biographer who insinuates his own moral high ground, he's a hypocrite - kicking down the dead for profit is more mercenarial than the questionable corporate actions he accuses Steve Jobs of. The most revealing - and heartbreaking - part in the whole book, is an interaction between the biographer and Steve Jobs just weeks before his death. Steve gives the biographer a box of precious family photographs, telling the biographer that he has entrusted the way he is remembered to Isaacson.  Steven mentions that perhaps he wouldn't like what Isaacson had to say in the book - revealing the heartless person that Isaacson is, the biographer agrees. Nice way to let a guy die, Isaacson.  The quotes Isaacson chooses from close friends and colleagues make you think that everyone hates Steve, but it's difficult to believe stories that are told from only one side - it's purposely one-dimensional. Isaacson reveals that his own interview questions went along the lines of \\"Steve said this hateful thing about you - how would you like to respond to that?\\" Well, what you ask is what you get.  The contempt was so deep that Isaacson seemed hardly able bring himself to portray positive emotional incidents - like people bonding with Steve Jobs, or enjoying a laugh with him. The incidents that do touch on those encounters are brief and underplayed. Isaacson can't help himself with constant digs throughout the book. There is always a counterbalancing - if someone says something nice about Steve, it's tempered by a negative incident. If someone says something bad about Steve, there's little redemption. Criminals, despots, and murderers have received more compassionate treatment by biographers, but Isaacson seems as incapable of empathy as his subject, even with Jobs was facing imminent death. I'm not sure who is more heartless - Jobs or Isaacson, but I think it's Isaacson.  To the extent that people complained a lot about Steve's behavior, I found it odd and telling that there was no mention of friends, relatives, or colleagues earlier in his career to seek psychological counseling. Everyone homed in a \\"reality distortion field\\" but no one seemed to question its roots, causes, or possible treatment. Casting it as a character flaw with a Trekkie term only served to mask possible mental illness or disorder. It seemed to me that Steve Jobs demonstrated some clear indications of borderline personality disorder in addition to an eating disorder early on in his life - but there's no mention of any of this until the end of his life (although some friends suggest narcissism), when he was already in the deep throes of fighting pancreatic cancer and a liver transplant. Anyone who has first-hand experience with eating disorders, cancer, pancreatic cancer, or liver disease, will tell you that those disease can ravage psychology as well as the body - and permanently affect brain chemistry. But Isaacson doesn't mention any of that.  That would give Steve too much credit.  It's too bad Steve Jobs chose Isaacson to portray him because Isaacson's account will likely be the most \\"authoritative\\" given that he was given unprecedented access by Steve and his wife, Laurene, to write this biography. Which, I think, Isaacson shamefully abused - like he was getting back at Steve for being a difficult subject or having skirmishes in the past with journalists and Time magazine (I think he spends a huge amount of time on these issues, which is revealing of his own bias).  I hope Mona Simpson writes a more fair biography of Steve Jobs, or even slants it the other way - so we get to see that Steve must have had a good side, redeemable qualities (I know, some will say she already did in \\"A Regular Man\\", but there is a huge difference between source material for a fictitious novel, and an intentional accounting of a person's life).
B004H3WWU2|1.0|I returned it on the same day I got it. Where do I start?  I was looking for something small - I hate big backpacks, and don't think I should be schlepping all my possessions around at all times. It seems that almost no one makes small laptop backpacks, and this seemed to be the only choice. I kind of expected it to be limited, but the reality was much worse.  I knew about those in advance:  - It doesn't stand upright - you have to hold it  - The middle zipper pocket is useless  - The side pockets are too small to be useful  What I didn't know, and couldn't live with:  - The curvy main zipper requires 3 hands to open and close. It resists your every attempt to slide it along those curves on the top - and since the backpack doesn't stand on its own, you have to use your knees to steady it while opening it.  - The shoulder straps are too short! Which means that their padded section ends somewhere next to my collar bones. This is partly because the pack is rigid and doesn't conform to your back, and partly because the straps are too short. I didn't think a small pack meant it was designed for small people... And this makes the strap phone holder unusable..  - Because of the design of the main compartment - when open slightly it tries to flap closed... which means you need to open it all the way to find anything. Not very convenient, especially in public. And when fully open - it hangs like a huge tongue displaying all the contents  - Side pockets are unusable  - The rigid construction and short straps just make it too uncomfortable, and frankly, quite ugly on your back. Instead of being snug against the shoulders - it tries to hang back and push its bottom into your kidneys  I ended up buying the Samsonite \\"Business Computer Backpack\\" which proved to be much better, and about the same size.

B0057RCFQS|5.0|This review is for the Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy standard DVD'S.<br />I at first REALLY wanted to buy this set on Blu-Ray but after reading<br />all the reviews on here on how bad the picture quality is and how grainy<br />it is I had second thoughts (I cannot stand a grainy picture, it goes<br />against the reason for having it in High Def). I went to my Walmart and<br />saw this set on Standard DVD and it said it is Digitally remastered so I<br />figured it at least had to be better than the older DVD trilogy so I bought it.<br />I am very glad I did, the picture is quite a bit better than the previous DVD's<br />and there is not much grain in the picture. Is the picture perfect? No. But<br />it is a big upgrade from the previous release and of course the sound is better<br />too. I would love to listen to it on Blu-Ray since I have a good Surround sound system<br />but the audio on this set is not bad at all and again a good upgrade. This set<br />also seems to have all the bonus features on the Blu-Ray set although I could be<br />mistaken.  To be fair for this review I put on the original DVD versions to compare<br />the picture so I would not be giving false information and I can definitely say this set is worth<br />it. I am just sorry The Blu-Ray set received such bad reviews for bad picture, I would have loved<br />to own it on Blu-Ray, but I am very grateful for people coming on here and letting<br />people like myself know the reality of what customers would be getting. To those<br />people I say thank you.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I was hesitant to rent the movie after reading some of the viewer reviews, but decided to go with it based upon the reviews from friends and Amazon viewers who gave it a high rating.  Not the least bit disappointed.  The movie was fast moving and funny.  It didn't lag like the vast majority of the movies out today.  No need to add any details as the trailer gives the best preview of what is to come; so, I'll just say it was $3.99 well worth spending.
B003L77GH4|5.0|The show just gets more amazing with the second season.  As soon as it starts to fall into a plot pattern \\"Oh, let's all save poor Elena\\" the show completely veers off into a new direction.  The acting is so outstanding it is hard to believe it is just a network TV show. My advice - avoid all plot summaries and details.  Just watch it and enjoy!

Sadly, we found that Basecamp is not compatible with the Rino 120, but after a little research we discovered that we can use GPSBabel (another free software) to snag the info from the Rino and place it in a folder, then import the folder into Basecamp.<br /><br />This whole time I was working with someone from Plugable, and was really impressed with their customer support. I wonder how many hours the person put into researching the problem for me, but I imagine it could have easily been more than two-three.<br /><br />Overall, the product is great, and the customer support is excellent!

0553801473|2.0|Well, that was a long wait. And after reading the book, one has to wonder why this took so long. Granted, there's a lot of pages, a lot of storylines, this and that, but most of it is writing for writing's sake. I felt like most of the storylines were clogged with repetition and derivative descriptions that didn't mean much.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead, obviously: After Feast, which I didn't enjoy as much as the rest but actually liked, we were all eager to hear from the main characters. In this book, we finally have news from Bran, Arya, Jon and Daenerys, but we soon learn that there won't be much happening. One of the things that has been bothering me most about the most recent books is the amount of repetition there is. It's almost as if the author no longer trusted our capacity to remember these things. The Davos chapters, for example. In this book, Davos sails south to talk to Lord Manderly. Well, we have one chapter where he arrives at the castle of a small lord and talk about what he will find once he talks to Lord Manderly. Then another chapter where he arrives at his destination, goes into a tavern and talk to someone else about what he'll find at Lord Manderly's castle. And then, when he finally gets to see Manderly, we get to read once again all the things that the previous informants said. Did we really need to read this three times? What makes this even worse is the fact that Davos' friend, Salla the pirate, has abandoned him off-shore, which is quite shocking, but we only read of it as an afterthought! \\"Oh, yeah, that happened to, but let me tell you for the fiftieth time that Davos reached for his neck\\".<br /><br />Some of the character's insightful chatter has been reduced to the repetition of a few sentences. We will read many, many times about \\"Reek, Reek, rhymes with...\\", \\"where do whores go\\" and \\"i am the blood of the dragon\\". Bran and Arya make cameos at best. Daenerys spends chapter after chapter dreaming about a man and making terrible decisionsthat only mean something towards the very end. Jaime's appearance seems almost like a bad joke on the reader. Tyrion does some interesting stuff until he gets paired with Jar Jar Binks. And worst of all, out of nowhere appears a second Targaryen that is supposed to be extremely important in the future, but feels like an enormous Deus Ex Machina.<br /><br />This is not to say nothing happened. Reek's storyline was nice, Jon's part was great (even though it could and should have been reduced), Stannis goes active, Cersei got some justice (although the \\"penitence\\" chapter was laughably long) and Barristan was awesome. But these parts were long and derivative like the rest of the book, even though what they were telling was great.<br /><br />Overall, there are quite a few cliffhangers in the book that make me hopeful for the next. But that only reinforces the notion that the past two books have been going nowhere. I doubt the story will finish in two books, considering how long it takes to tell so little. And considering the first three books are amazing, this is quite sad.

B004Q7E0TA|5.0|Portia describes her downward spiral into her eating disorder(s)in a way that cannot help but draw you in.  I actually felt the helplessness, the desperation, with which she devoted the major part of her day to these diseases.  Similarly, I could feel her very gradual ability to trust and become vulnerable to a loving and honest relationship built on who she really is--not what her image is.  A lesson for us all, regardless of our individual obsessions or weaknesses, this book gets inside of you and has something to teach us all about being loved and loving ourselves for our uniqueness.  Portia, thankyou for sharing such a painful and time-consuming part of your life with us.

0451228375|3.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth, I was happy to find a sequel that followed some of the same families from the first story, but 200 years later. Being familiar with Kingbridge and Shiring, I was happy to read on from before.  However, this story was not nearly as good as the first. The two parts that made me dislike the story were of grammar and style. There are too many typos. It's as though they knew the story would be successful so the publisher was not as strict. At times I thought that maybe it was an error on my own reading since the language may be different as the story takes place in the 14th century, but Follett did not write with the language of the time, so I realized that there are a lot of mistakes in the book.  The next thing I hated about the writing was that whenever something unpleasant comes the phrase used mostly is 'it struck him like a blow.' I can see this being a good use of words, but after 10 or 12 times, I could go without it. On occassion, 'it stabbed him like a knife.'  Overall, though, I liked it. It takes forever for justice to come, and, like in the first one, things have to get really bad for things to get better, but that's Follett's style. If he came out with a 3rd story that took place in the 16th century, I'd be interested in reading it.

1439192812|5.0|When I was a kid, I had a four volume set of science books. The name and publisher is long since lost to my memory, but the impact these books had on my young mind resonates even today. The volumes were richly illustrated, written in a lively and engaging manner, and addressed all the questions that my young mind could think of. Space travel, plate tectonics, microscopic wonders, time travel, etc. I recall hours and hours spent with this set of books; reading methodically or browsing aimlessly. So great was their impact on me that even into adulthood, when visiting my parents' house, I would pull these books off a dusty shelf in their basement and sit and reread portions out of sheer nostalgia and admiration.  My recollections of this very special set of science books from my own childhood was powerfully evoked as I sat down with Richard Dawkins' new book The Magic of Reality. Within the first few pages, I was transported back to my 10 year old self by the style of writing and straightforward presentation of top notch science. Bill Bryson, in his A Short History of Nearly Everything, recalls his own experiences of childhood with science books, especially those used in elementary school classrooms. He bemoans the fact that so many times, those books presented fascinating content, but didn't answer the main question that he had; \\"how do they know that?\\" In Magic, Dawkins does answer that question, and does it in a way that I think will resonate with a whole new generation of young readers.  The 12 chapters of Magic are structured around questions. Each chapter is titled by the topic question, \\"Who was the first person?\\" \\"Why are there so many different kinds of animals?\\" \\"What is a rainbow?\\" and so on. Each chapter begins with a survey of legend and mythology to explore how these questions were answered before the advent of science and the age of reason. The text is lavishly illustrated by Dave McKean with beautiful, colorful artwork. Every page has art, making for acompelling and interesting presentation.   Dawkins' abilities as a communicator and explainer are well known. He is arguably the most significant popularizer of science since Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould. Predictably, given that his own expertise is in evolutionary biology, he has made his most significant impact in presenting evolution to a general readership. His first book, The Selfish Gene, is recognized as a seminal work and has sold over 1 million copies since its publication in 1976. He has been one of the most outspoken scientific voices combatting creationism in all its forms, and many of his publications in the 1980's and 90's were wonderful expositions of natural selection (The Blind Watchmaker and Climbing Mount Improbable). His most recent book prior to Magic was The Greatest Show on Earth, his major exposition of the evidence in favor of Darwin's theory.  So it's no surprise that I found the most engaging material in Magic are the chapters that deal directly with evolution. Dawkins takes it as a given that his readers - kids - are capable of understanding where we really come from. Evolution may be a complex academic discipline, but its basic tenants can be understood by anyone bothering to look at the issue seriously. With this book, Dawkins presents yet another opportunity for people to do so, this time in a vehicle aimed at young readers.  Many of the arguments he presents can be found in other forms in some of his earlier writings. My favorite, by far, is found in chapter 2, \\"Who was the first person?\\" In this chapter, he uses an analogy that he's used before to illustrate the principle of gradual change and the fuzzy boundaries between species. Imagine, he says, if you take a picture of a person each and every day of their life. The picture taken on Tuesday, October 4th will look much like the picture taken Monday, October 3. In fact, over a period of days or weeks, not much change will take place. However, compare the October 4th picture withthe picture of the same date of the year before, and you'll see some noticeable change. Compare pictures taken a decade apart, and you'll see even more dramatic differences. So then, he continues, when did the infant become the toddler? When did the child become the adolescent, or the boy the man? Such distinctions are impossible to identify on the scale of the minute changes that take place day to day.   Dawkins then enlarges the model and asks us to image a picture taken once a generation; a man compared to his father, his grandfather, great grandfather, and so on, back in time over tens, hundreds and thousands of generations. How far back to we have to go before our ancestors are so very different from us? It's a fascinating thought experiment, and one that he and McKean illustrate beautifully by adding a horizontal stack of photographs to the bottom of each page of the chapter, thousands of photos tightly stacked and trailing across the page and onto the next. At intervals, the illustrations show a random picture plucked out so we can see it. Here a distinctly primitive man (the 50,000th-great-grandfather), two pages later a distinctly simian creature (your 250,000th-great-grandfather) and so on. His point, of course, is that imperceptible changes, when stacked up over hundreds of thousands of generations, add up to real and substantial changes, and the eventual emergence of new species.  The book is filled with many such apt presentations and illustrations, but some of the content felt a bit forced. It appeared almost as though Dawkins had certain topics that he wanted to (or felt he needed to) cover, but rather than having an entire chapter devoted to then, he shoehorned them in somewhere else. One example of this occurs on pages 106-107, a two-page spread that illustrates and explains the phenomenon of free-fall, so-called weightlessness. This two-page spread is anchored by a McKean reproduction of Isaac Newton's classic illustration of the cannon atop a mountain sitting atop a miniature earth. Dotted lines illustrate how the cannon ball falls to the ground after it's fired from the barrel. The further the ball is hurled though, the further around the curved surface of the earth it travels, because the curvature causes the surface to drop away from the ball, even as the ball is dropping toward the ground. Finally, the ball is fired with enough velocity that it continues all they way around, as the ground drops away at the same rate that the ball falls. Ignoring resistance from the atmosphere, the ball would \\"fall\\" around the Earth forever.  It's a typically clear and compelling explanation, and illustrated beautifully, and you would not be surprised to find it in a chapter entitled \\"Why are people and things weightless in spaceships?\\" or something similar. This explanation, however, is in the chapter entitled \\"Why do we have winter and summer?\\" Now clearly, the concept of an orbit is important here, because a necessary part of the explanation of the seasons involves understanding the behavior of the Earth as it orbits the sun. However, it seemed a bit pedantic and overkill to have it embedded in the main narrative of the chapter on seasons instead of as a sidebar or inset. Or indeed, as a separate chapter altogether, dedicated to the interesting topic of weightlessness.  This observation leads me to another on the book itself. I was surprised when it arrived in the mail and found it was such a big book. Two hundred seventy pages (including index) and in a large format with fairly dense text. For some reason, ever since I heard about the book in pre-publication press releases, I was expecting a children's book. I had envisioned a large layout, 40-50 page book aimed at predominantly early elementary aged kids. This book is clearly aimed at younger readers, but much more middle school to younger high school students. The material is simplified, but by no means simple.   Though Dawkins has made his reputation as a scientist and science popularizer, over the last five years he has also become well known as one of the most outspoken atheists and critics of religion in the world. His best selling book is not about biology at all, but atheism. His 2006 publication of The God Delusion sold over 2 million copies and raised the issue of atheism to the level of a major public conversation. What role, if any, does Dawkins' outspoken criticism of religion play in this new book? As one might predict, he does not shy away from the question, but neither does he confront it head on. As noted earlier, each chapter commences its exploration of the question at hand by surveying the myths and legends that were used to explain the unknown prior to the rise of science. Even before he brings the introductory chapter to a close, he fires a shot at a theistic sacred cow with this salvo, concluding a section under the heading the \\"slow magic of evolution:\\"   The magical changing of a frog into a prince would be not gradual but sudden, and this is what rules such things out of the world of reality. Evolution is a real explanation, which really works, and has real evidence to demonstrate the truth of it; anything that suggests that complicated life forms appeared suddenly, in one go (rather than evolving gradually step by step), is just a lazy story - no better than the fictional magic of a fairy godmother's wand.  This is characteristic of Dawkins' approach to the question of religion or theism in this book. He does not attack particular beliefs or creeds; he pointedly identifies sloppy thinking and anti-science superstitions. He treats Christianity as just another mythological tradition; one of many. Again, in chapter 7 (What is a rainbow), he says of the story of Noah's flood:   In fact, it is obvious that the Jewish story of Noah is nothing more than a retelling of the older legend of Utnapishtim. It was a folk tale that got passed around, and it traveled down the centuries.  This straightforward dismissal of the obvious point (at least obvious to skeptics of religion) that a story is just a story, and much different from a serious history or legitimate scientific explanation. Whether those stories are part of a cherished religious tradition or not makes no difference in this volume. This is not a book about bashing religious thinking in general, nor any specific religious tradition.  Perhaps his most pointed directive aimed at religion comes in the final two chapters, \\"Why do bad things happen?\\" and \\"What is a miracle?\\" But even here, it's far from a confrontational critique. In these chapters, Dawkins returns to his strength: a simple and elegant discussion of the natural world and the nature of randomness. It's human nature to look for patterns or meaning. Children, when asked why trees have such rough bark, may reply that it's so animals can scratch themselves by rubbing against them. Likewise, we as a species are primed to see meaning and patterns, especially in the absence of other obvious reasons. Here, he both simplifies and expands upon the argument he and others have used in the past. Religion is simply a subset of thinking in which the formerly unexplainable was rationalized. Most of the reasons that gave rise to religious and other mythological forms of thinking have been slowly whittled away by the steady progress of science and reason. Dawkins' explanation of the nature of miracles and miraculous thinking simply assumes that there is no reason to believe that this trend will not continue. To my humanist and atheistic sensibilities, his approach is both obvious and gratifyingly simple.   Magic is a good book, and a great addition to the library of any student interested in science or the natural world. It will make a great gift this holiday season. It is also a natural step on the, er, evolution of Richard Dawkins' recent literary contributions. His first eight books focused mostly within his field of evolutionary biology, either directly, via historical survey and narrative, or by virtue of his defenses against creationism. He then departed significantly from this course with the 2006 publication of The God Delusion. Next came The Greatest Show on Earth, an inspired collection and presentation of the evidences for evolution. Dawkins has clearly articulated a two-pronged approach to his craft as a promulgator of science education: affirmative presentation and explanation of the science, and a proactive attack on what he sees as the chief enemy of science: the proliferation of supernaturalism (chiefly religion). His forays into documentary filmmaking mirror this dual approach. The appearance of The Magic of Reality this year makes perfect sense to me because it beautifully embodies both messages. Having spoken loud and long in this vein, a book aimed at younger audiences makes perfect sense  Let me end this review with a prediction. Dawkins is not done. I believe that within two years we will see a major television documentary release on the scale of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Dawkins has shown that he can command major audiences in his public speaking tours. He has appeared on Colbert, and his previous television documentaries have shown that his personal charm and commanding presence translate well into the visual medium. Cosmos has never been equaled in its popularity, reach or enduring appeal. Richard Dawkins will make that leap and produce a series for public television (and a US release) that will rival and perhaps even surpass Sagan's own \\"magic.\\"
B002R88G4U|4.0|The story of the occupation of Guernsey by the German Army during the latter years of the Second World War is beautifully told in a series of letters between the characters. It takes some time to form one's impressions of each of the characters and their relationships with the others. This is a deliberate build-up by the author, and you should be patient. You will be rewarded.<br /><br />The title of the book bears some explanation, and, when you come to it during the course of your reading, that explanation is sure to delight you. I promise! How did the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society come into being? And why Potato Peel Pie?<br /><br />You'll just have to read it for yourself, because I'm not going to tell you.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Bought this as a quick & inexpensive solution to line-level output from a HD monitor.  My xbox360 is now set up with HDMI out to the HD monitor, but I'm using audio line out from the monitor from there.  Computer speakers did the trick but need to use headphones from time to time. As this is a powered amp, it allows me to enjoy decent quality volume from 0 to louder than I need and I think it works better than a non-powered in-line solution would since those are generally just volume limiters by definition. For the price, I'm happy with it and get no extraneous buzz even though it's on a large desk with a laptop, HD monitor, 2 external hard drives, and an xbox360.
B004LROUNG|2.0|I don't know why I keep falling for this.  Grisham peaked two decades ago with his first four books and nothing since has come close.  Given that people like me keep buying his new work, I guess he really doesn't have to try too hard.  The Litigators reads like a loose combination of several previous plots and lacks that special quality that keeps the reader so involved that you can't put the book down.  A Time to Kill, The Firm.....remember how great those early books were?  Come on Mr. Grisham, give us one more of those.  Dig deep!  This one reads like you wrote it in a weekend.
1592536913|1.0|As BorisM noted, this is kitsch (if even that). It has very little to do with true steampunk aesthetic and more to do with people cobbling useless junk together into non-functional forms and passing it off as something trendy. It's noteworthy that on the book's back cover, the publisher advertises _1,000 Ideas for Creative Reuse_ and another \\"make things out of junk\\" book called _Who's Your Dada_, which, judging by its cover, is also a book about making art from \\"found objects\\" rather than about Dadaism.  There are some interesting pieces in the book, but they're few. The author apparently doesn't understand that steampunk is not about slapping old pieces of metal together or making \\"costumes\\" that have more gimmicks than actual period clothing or style. Actual function is large part of steampunk aesthetic, as is a rejection of modern plastic design for the more pleasing use of brass and wood (and other materials).   I've seen the style of the art in this book in the 1990s, where it took on a grunge patina rather than stealing the form (over substance) from steampunk. Basically, its out-of-work art school graduates who believe that anything they put together is Art and we should all be in awe of it and their talent. Oddly, most people who make interesting and aesthetically pleasing steampunk items are engineers and technicians, not the sloppy \\"lookit me!\\" scene parasites that overpopulate this book, crowding out the few photos in the book of anyone creating something actually interesting.

Grendel then comes down to \\"Mead Hall,\\" & slays as many humans as he can, but there waiting for him this time is Beowulf, & the battle rages on!

This is the first movie of it's kind for it's genre, 100% CGI, \\"Beowulf\\" is no \\"Toy Story,\\" & thank god for that!

You could compare it to, \\"300,\\" but that film is not completely CGI, though it is very CGI enhanced. \\"Beowulf\\" would work as a normal actor film with CGI for special effects too, as all the actors that were involved with this film were truly first rate, but I got to admit, I love the CGI in this movie! It's like watching an animated film come to life, & the CGI just enhances everything, making the film real & surreal at the same time!<br /><br />\\"Beowulf\\" offers something for just about everyone. You get a first rate sword & sorcery fantasy film, a medieval setting, action a plenty, truly amazing CGI, monsters, & a story line that is old & deep as man himself. Man's weakness for seduction of wealth, fame, & women. Man's regret for being weak, as his greed turns on him, & the ones he loves, & maybe the oldest truth of them all, once you have everything, there is nothing more to look forward to, but boredom, you are back where you started. \\"Beowulf\\" uses all these themes to great success, as it is a well written film, filled with top notch actors like, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Ray Winstone, Brendon Gleason, Crispin Glover, John Malkovich, & Robin Wright. These actors make this film come to life!<br /><br />As I said earlier, the more I watch this film, the better it gets. I just got the Blu-ray version, & it is absolutely perfection!

B00012QM8G|5.0|In the film \\"Schindler's List\\" Oskar Schindler, a German entrepreneur, hires Jews as cheap labor to work in his new factory in Czechoslovakia. Over time he becomes something a lot like a savior of the Jews. He goes from a money hungry business man to the savior of over 1000 Jews from the gas chamber during the Holocaust. The cold SS Captain, Amon Goeth one of the main people Schindler bribes is sent to Czechoslovakia where he is asked to build a labor camp. He is stationed at a camp as its commandant. Through out the film there seems to be a mutual friendship between Amon Goeth and Oskar Schindler. During a party Oskar Schindler confronts Amon Goeth's Jewish maid. He then finds out that she has been abused by Amon Goeth, provoking what appears to be compassion from the businessman Schindler. When the order comes down to ship all Jews in the area to Auschwitz Schindler can't help but to want to save his workers. Through a series of bribes to many different key members of the Nazi party He is able to move \\"his workers\\" to his home town. When the war ends Schindler has to flee his own home but before he does his Jewish workers give him a ring and a letter explaining how they felt about him and the love they had for him. When he died he was placed in a Jewish graveyard. There the Jewish survivors, whom he had hired and essentially saved, visited his grave. The ending scene is of his spirit in the graveyard.   I believe this movie brought a new level of respect to the Jewish community from outsiders as well as a respect of other religions people don't really know about. I know after I watched it I felt a deep sorrow for the whole Jewish community. The loss and torture these people endured should never be put upon anyone. The impact of the Holocaust is still felt today by many members of the Jewish community and that hurts me. I hope that past events and knowledge of other peoples beliefs can prevent this from happening again. I hope everyone will take the time to watch this movie.
1609611543|5.0|The book is extremely enlightening.  It is also very well researched and referenced.  I checked out a very large number of the references, but then finally stopped doing that because I got the same result everytime; the references are all valid.  The last 1/8\\" of the book is references.<br /><br />You'll find out after reading the book (and checking on the references for yourself) that wheat-free living is very \\"counter-intuitive\\" in our culture.  The government and mega-business have convinced us that wheat (especially whole-grain wheat) is necessary and healthy.  This is so very wrong.  Nearly criminal.<br /><br />Wheat (and a diet that includes other whole-grains) is just the opposite of healthy.  Wheat products produce huge blood sugar spikes that lead to everything from diabetes to heart disease.<br /><br />Enough preaching,... read the book and find out all this stuff for yourself.<br /><br />I started the wheat-free system in early October 2011.  It is a month later, and I am enjoying these benefits so far:<br />  -- the headaches I have endured for decades (several per week) are GONE!!<br />  -- more energy<br />  -- easier to fall asleep,.. no more melatonin, no more \\"sleeping aids,\\" just put head on pillow, close eyes, wake up later<br />  -- losing about a pound per week (I started at 211.

B00417HV14|5.0|With the exception of Stevie Ray and Peter Green, JB is my favorite guitarist.  And he's probably the cleanest.  And don't forget his vocals.  He's seriously under-rated.  This concert will blow your mind.  Perfect execution and the two drummers are seriously synched.  My only \\"complaint\\" (as a keyboardist) is that the organ mix could have been hotter.  The rest of the keys are fine.  If your jaw doesn't seriously hang open while watching/listening to this - you're probably not a real musician...
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|Great movie and great music!  I am a Paltrow fan and she does it up right in this movie.  Tim Macgraw is awesome also.  He gets better with each movie.  You won't be disappointed.  Can't beat Amazon or their prices!

Its a nice addition to my lower pro series of bags. I really like the zippers those are really made good quality, and the how quickly i can use my stuff with safety. Use this bag to store my extra lens 35 f1.8/40mm f2.8 and sb600 flash. I didn't got a chance to test the rain cover but it should be good. Thanks lower pro for making quality products, .

B001B2U1AA|5.0|I didn't understand Monty Python back when; I do now! How did they think this stuff up? This is a great set of DVDs; I recommend it. (I bought more than one set.) Life of Brian was the movie that converted me to Pythonism.  Monty Python is classic; it never goes out of style. There is nothing produced of this high-caliber these days. MP is \\"rolling-in-the-aisles\\" funny.  When will Monty Python movies and TV shows be available for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch? I can find nothing on the subject.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|Yes, we all know the history; the egos were clashing, Waters was taking over, the band was disintegrating, Wright was out, et al.  Standard aging rock star drama.  Despite all that, and although it is not the Floyd's strongest release, I do quite like The Final Cut.  Yes it is a stark album, but there are a lot of compelling moments.  Yes, it is a bit depressing, but there are indeed some great lyrics.  Yes, Waters dominated the writing, production, and apparently everything else, but it is certainly better than any of his subsequent solo stuff.  There really are some solid songs on here:  'Your Possible Pasts', 'The Hero's Return', 'The Gunner's Dream', 'Not Now John', 'Southhampton Dock', 'The Final Cut', and especially 'The Fletcher Memorial Home'.  'One of the Few' is also good and I enjoy the powerful ending and orchestration on 'The Post War Dream'.  'Two Suns in the Sunset' is another decent song, and I especially like the melancholy sax to close it out after the bombs hit.  Of the aforementioned songs, I'd say that only 'The Fletcher Memorial Home' is a true Floyd classic, and even that is a bit of a stretch.  Some die-hard Floyd fans don't like The Final Cut, so it is obviously not for everyone.  Call it what you want; the bastard cousin of The Wall, a Waters solo-project.  Whatever.  It is what it is.  It is not perfect.  It is not their best.  Despite it's shortcomings, I think there is a lot to like, and ultimately I do find it to be worthy of the Floyd name.

B004XQO90O|5.0|Mix One part Inception, one part Ground Hog Day, one part Run Lola Run, and one half part It's A Wonderful Life, and you have this exciting movie, Source Code. Great acting, great pacing, excellent sound, and Chicago make for a movie well worth watching.<br /><br />No, there is just no way to describe the plot without ruining the film, those other films are great even when I know the plot; this film, there would be something ruined knowing too much about it. If, by chance, you understand the Run Lola Run analogy, that will not ruin the film for you at all - Source Code is not as cerebral as that film but there is still a flavor.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, and Vera Farmiga are outstanding in this film. Gyllenhaal shows just exactly the right emotions. Michelle Monaghan is radiant; she has just exactly the right amount of vulnerability and tenderness in her face. Vera Farmiga is perfectly robotic throughout the film, a real stretch for her. Her gorgeous blue eyes are almost a character all their own. These three actors show a rare chemistry - the two women are subtly attracted to Gyllenhaal.<br /><br />The cover art makes this movie look like a shoot 'em up film, it is far from that. The film is rated PG-13, aside from one f bomb, and the psychological factors, this film would be perfectly fine for a mature younger viewer. There are some very brief disturbing images, nothing worse than what is on television frequently. It is an exciting, edge of your seat film.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed this film since it was filmed in Chicago and Glenview, two places I'm very familiar with. The opening montage of Chicago is incredibly beautiful. The Glenview train station was used mostly as is, with some minor additions. The only oddity, there is no lower level or stairs to be chased down (certainly not a big deal, artistic license is important). Some of the geography gets a little mixed up (like Skokie is nowhere near the Metra line they used, so it couldn't be the next stop), but you'd have to be from this area to even remotely see those mix ups. In no way do these details take away from the film.<br /><br />The running time of ninety-three minutes is about right; the film isn't too long or too short. About midway, the film hits a story transition that is a bit rough, the peak of the plot arc has passed and the film is on its way to resolution. There is a short ten minutes when I wondered if the film was going to end sometime soon. Gratefully the plot moves along and the film hits a whole new exciting pace. The roughness is like a song changing tempo, at first it feels wrong, and then a new groove settles in.<br /><br />This is a really wonderful intense film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002ZG980U Inception]]<br />[[ASIN:B000Z8GZYW Groundhog Day (Special 15th Anniversary Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000021Y77 Run Lola Run]]<br />[[ASIN:B000HEWEJO It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition)]]to be from this area to even remotely see those mix ups.

B0060D2QR6|3.0|Nicholas Sparks has found a formula about teenage angst an finding love despite non-supportive parents: from the number of books and films that use his formula it would seem he has hit pay dirt. THE LAST SONG is Sparks' 14th published novel on the same theme as the preceding 13 and was published in 2009. One year later he transformed that sudsy story (with some help from Jeff Van Wie) into another of his formula films and turned it over to TV director Julie Anne Robinson to map out the predictable story.<br /><br />For a brief outline of the scant story: begin with a divorced family - Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her younger brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) are sent to spend the summer with their father Steve (Greg Kinnear) in an indescribably beautiful waterfront town in Georgia.  Ronnie resents her father and has no intention of being friendly or even talking to him for the summer. But after meeting a handsome guy Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) and beginning to fall in love, Ronnie starts rediscovering her love for music, something she shares with her father. Reconnecting with music revives a kinship with her father which proves to be the most important relationship she may ever experience. And there it is.  Mix the story with the usual acidic girls in  the town who claim Will is a Lothario, overcome that rumor with some all night watches for raccoons who may steal some sea turtle eggs, pop in some father/son meaningful contact, and there you have a Nicholas Sparks formula.<br /><br />Miley Cyrus is Miley Cyrus - and for fans of Hannah Montana that works well.  The light of the film is the screen presence of Liam Hemsworth who looks and acts like someone who will succeed in movies. Otherwise, just be advised that this is another setting for a Nicholas parks  familiar story; if that is to your liking you will like this. If not, then pass.  Grady Harp, November 11

1567407757|5.0|Morrie was a retired academic known for liberal views and maintaining contact with his college students long after they graduated.  In his last days, he made it clear in many ways that relationships and how we treat one another matter more than money and career success.  Listening to his words, I felt that I knew he correct.  It's not necessarily easy to follow his wisdom daily as we get pulled in other directions.  We're interconnected in mysterious ways. This is something Morrie liked to explore long before his illness.  This book communicates that message in a flow that can require patience on the part of the reader. One needs patience to live the way Morrie advocates.  Actually, I listened to the audiobook. The author is the narrator; it is well-narrated.  The lessons Morrie teaches are timeless yet not absorbed quickly. His wisdom is not communicated in pithy quotes.  The gift that he and the author gave us in this book is a lesson on living the good life.  The good life is defined as filled with meaning, happiness and relationships.  Although in a state of pain and suffering, Morrie devoted himself to helping others in his final days.
B005ARYEPK|5.0|I've seen the new film with Kenny Wormald a number of times, and I really like it, so I was inspired to buy the original as Kevin Bacon will always be the definitive Ren, and I really wanted to see it again. I didn't realize that a new 2011 deluxe edition had been released, so I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the extras on the DVD included new in depth interviews with Bacon and Sarah Jessica Parker. Great interviews with lots of interesting information I never knew about.  Kevin Bacon also does the full video commentary making it all the more pleasurable. Get on your dancing shoes!

1613821395|3.0|It feels strange to be giving only three stars to a \\"classic.\\" But having plowed through this Victorian bestseller, I found quite a bit to admire and some things that were sadly dated.<br /><br />On the plus side, the narration is very innovative for its time, telling the mysterious story of the \\"Woman in White\\" and the evil Sir Percival from many different points of view. Some of the minor characters spring beautifully to life as they tell their part of the story. The author has a keen eye for Victorian hypocrisy and sham piety and a sly sense of humor.<br /><br />The book's greatest weakness, apart from its Victorian sentimentality, is in its patronizing attitude to women which may have reflected its times (although one certainly doesn't feel that way reading the Brontes or some other contemporaries) but seems almost unbearable today. The \\"heroine\\" Laura is such a weak, pathetic creature that one doesn't see her attraction at all. She is treated like a veritable infant by her lover, Walter, as well as her half-sister. Important news is kept from her lest she sicken to the point of death or go mad and she is kept in a cocoon of ignorance for vast swathes of the book. She is truly a helpless heroine.<br /><br />Women are truly powerless in this era against the machinations of unscrupulous men -- but they were surely not as helpless and pathetic as this.<br /><br />Her sister Marian is a much more spirited creature but even she almost dies after getting a bit wet in the rain. I felt she and Walter would have made a far better match but Marian is described as being ugly while Laura has the fair beauty of a china doll. Marian ends up cast in the role of the maiden aunt, an unfair fate for such a lively and self-reliant character.<br /><br />One strength of the book is its most memorable character, the Italian Count Fosco, a huge mountain of a man who loves to train little mice and plays with song birds. He is more of a pantomime villain than a true evil genius and is presented in such a colorful way that he emerges as by far the character that is the fullest of life.<br /><br />The author works his way to a nice climax but one never buys into the love affair at the center of the novel because the two principles are such a pallid pair.by far the character that is the fullest of life.

1451648537|5.0|I've just finished reading this book.  I don't believe I have thought so hard reading book since I finished a liberal arts graduate degree.  I'm absolutely convinced that Jobs deserved almost all of the credit for the graphic user interface; primarily as a result of his unique vision and fierce drive.  This I believe was responsible for ninety percent of personal computer ownership.  He was also personally responsible for Apple's sorry market share in the personal computer market.  Both results emerged from the same set of personality traits.  Gate's was fascinated by Steve Jobs and so was I.  Jobs was not a person I'd care to be friends with or work with or to work for.  Still I don't think that it is hyperbole to place his name in a pantheon that includes Galileo, Einstein and Ford; I could go on with many other icons of science, industry and the arts.    My professional career as an engineer coincided pretty much with that of Jobs.  My first two personal computers were Macintoshes; the rest were Wintel machines. It would have been pretty much impossible to pursue my profession with the idiosynchratic incompatibilities occasioned by Jobs' compulsive dedication to the vertical integration of his products.  My wife has an Iphone (that I encouraged her to get) and I have an Android phone.  I still can't figure out wat an Ipad is for; my laptop has an eighteen inch screen and weighs over ten pounds.  I have an Ipod; I think I must be schizoid.    Isaacson has done a superb job of framing all of the irony and contradiction that was Steve Jobs.  I consider it a real privilege to have read his book; I'll be thinking about it for long time.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|I've seen A Christmas Carol in several different movie versions and on stage in community theatre. It's a classic for a reason.  It's fun to read the original story and see how it compares to later adaptations. I also enjoy Dickens' writing style/voice. A lot of writers today are very bland and straight-forward. With Dickens, it feels more like \\"story time\\", like we're all gathered around the fireplace listening to him tell us this classic tale at Christmas time.  And it's free for the Kindle... so why wouldn't you get it? ;)
0439813786|5.0|By now you know what you are about to purchase. However I am not so sure I was.  I have to confess I did not know of this book until I saw the trailer for the movie.  Then it was a shocker to see the physical volume of the book.  On opening the book I found it contained one hundered and fifty-eight pictures to accompany twenty-six thousand one hundred and fifty-nine words.  Not until I started reading the book did I realize the graphics were not illustrating the words but actuary part of the story.<br /><br />In all my years I have not come upon a unique combination of the way the story is told. And to add to this it is an interweaving of a fictional protagonist to tell the story of a real life person. I have seen the formula of interweaving reality with a fictional character before; one of the most famous is \\"Sophie's World\\" by Jostein Gaarder. Both books have more depth that imagined at the start of reading.<br /><br />Any way the basic story is of a child that loses his father and thinks that his father left him a message that will change his life. In the process of perusing the message he meets Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who may just have a message to change the reader's life.<br /><br />A great site for more information is  fi.edu/pieces/knox/automaton
B000JQU1VS|4.0|This is a fairly engaging classic read, and would be worth your while to download, especially as it is free. Given the mediocre (or, in some cases, even less than mediocre) free downloadables that Amazon has granted virtual publication through its site, reading this one would give your tortured minds a rest as you follow the genius of crime-solving Sherlock Holmes and his faithful companion, Dr. Watson.<br /><br />What may be a bit jarring in this collection is that, after four or five stories where you read about Holmes' brilliant conclusions, one after another, you start getting a bit tired of his seemingly unbeatable logic. After a while you start thinking to yourself, \\"Ah, surely it is so-and-so who did this, because it's similar to that story awhile back ...\\" and it is a bit of a letdown when you find that you are actually correct. However, if you do not mind finding your suspension of disbelief slowly being worn down by story after story, then by all means go ahead and read this collection. I assure you that you will not be sorry if you do.

B0041KKYBK|5.0|I wanted to learn more about the truth of how this whole economic implosion began and its subsequent unraveling. I think that everyone who banks and/or invests should see this! It tells the unbiased truth about how it all started, who was involved, it names names, interviews many of the players and shows how vulnerable we all are to the same thing repeating itself in the future. Unbelievably many of the same players are still at the helm, no one is being investigated, and no one has gone to jail for thier part in destroying so many lives. I'm sure you will find the truth as disturbing as I do. I feel compelled to share this knowledge with as many people as I can. Ignorance is dangerous to our future.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|I'll be honest here about my love for PIXAR: I love it, and almost nothing (but CARS, and sequel) will ever tarnish that. Wall-E is just one of those staple films, such as Toy Story and UP, that I will always look at as a PIXAR film. Yeah, I know Disney had stuff to do on them also, but come on.<br />No downside to this DVD. You either love it or you don't. No walking the fence. The silent era comedy is back with the ability to tell a story with music, and virtually no talking from the main character. If you want to look at behind the scenes stuff. This blue-ray will fill your brain with every conceivable factoid/tidbit that could possibly pop into the brain similar a question on Jeopardy popping onto the TV screen... but in the Blue-ray case? It's so much clearer!
B005DZMP00|4.0|First off, it's a good, if not a very good CD, and I enjoy listening to it.  But, if you have the original Europe '72, Steppin' Out with the Grateful Dead, Rockin' the Rhine, and Hundred Year Hall (all from the '72 Europe tour), you don't really need this one.  There are a couple songs on this one that aren't on any of the other CD's (such as Dire Wolf) and some amazing versions of songs (Dark Star and The Other One).  If you're a fan of the Europe '72 stuff, you're going to get this one anyway.  If you've already got stuff from the Europe '72 tour and are on the fence, maybe not needed.  But if you get it, you're not going to be disappointed.

I am one of those odd fans that loved the \\"LOAD\\" & RELOAD\\" albums and thought the extended Garage Inc CD's were daring and had some great \\"Metallisised\\" versions of classic tracks..many included on this two DVD show that cranks! This was Metallica at what I considered their peak. Fine tuned like a monster on steroids! The stage is crazy! The audience surrounds them like a cage match. I have watched this DVD over and over since it came out! If you liked pre- \\"St. Anger\\", and thought Jason was at his peak at this stage (He does a steaming intro ala' Cliff RIP on \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\"), get this DVD! Too bad the most over-looked \\"I Disappear\\" hadn't been recorded yet and was on this and it would be perfect. When I see this, I miss Metallica!
B004ZJADOU|5.0|Radu Lupu's piano playing has always provided me with great enjoyment. His tone, technique and seemingly deep feel for the music that he is performing has always been most appealing to me.  It is so very nice to have on six (6) discs for a very good price ($28.15) all of his purported concerto recordings for the Decca label (or as it was called, in this country, back in the day, the London label),    I especially loved his playing of all five (5) of the Beethoven concertos. (includes two (2) versions of my favorite Beethoven piano concerto, the 3rd in c minor with the second version with the London Symphony being very dramatically wonderful) He, of course, gives very brilliant performances playing technically just wonderfully.  However, to me, in the slow movements, he plays with \\"his heart on his sleeves\\" playing very movingly.  One of my favorite concertos, the Brahms' 1st concerto is also played wonderfully--all that I can say is Bravo. (Please note that his playing of Mozart's Piano concertos numbers 12 and 21 is just lovely indeed)    NO I have not forgotten that he is NOT alone,  Radu Lupu is accompanied and lead by some of the best (i.e., Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic, Edo de Waart, Andre Previn, et al).  It is so very good to have these recordings \\"all together\\" they are superb plus the sound is very good.

B000B7BRMM|2.0|Ms. Krall apparently aimed for \\"Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas\\" but her uninspired performances miss the mark.  I'm left with the impression that she was bored with the whole idea of a holiday album, but was dragged into producing one to raise a few bucks.  Cool detachment may be stylish, but when it comes to this subject matter, please, leave it at home.  On a positive note, the backing arrangements and musicians are excellent - hence the two stars.  Can we get a version with the vocals stripped away?  Oh yes, and the cover - rarely have I seen one that gives a more accurate idea of what you'll get inside - no clue about the subject matter.  Do yourself a favor, if you want the best jazz-vocal holiday collection, skip this disc and get Ella Fitzgerald's early '60's classic instead.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|What was Metallica thinking and why would anyone give this album more than one star? I had preordered this and when I herd the whole album off their Lou Reed Metallica website I quickly canceled. Every song sounds the same and it is so repetitious you can't help but ask what were they thinking. Save your money, this is not a masterpiece or unique an any way. People are just being nice when they give it more than one star. Hopefully Metallica will be back in the studio recording a real masterpiece and until then enjoy megadeths new album 13.

B005UZ1IJC|5.0|WOW.  This is one of my favorite albums of all-time and I've always complained about the CD versions being too quiet and murky (luckily I have the vinyl and an awesome amplifier to make up for it).  You don't need vinyl compensation for this one.  This remastering job is incredible.  It really does make me listen to the album in a different way and bring certain sounds I never noticed back into the mix the same way the 2009 Beatles remasters did for their catalogue.  The drums and vocals (and at certain points piano) are much more at the forefront of the mix than they were on previous releases.  It is definitely a much fresher sounding mix than the previous compact disc releases.  I've listened to the entire original album portion haven't gotten to the bonus disc yet, but the original album sounds absolutely fantastic.  Let's hope some of Tull's other masterpieces get the same treatment (Thick As a Brick especially).  This remaster does seem to up the volume and clarity while not adding that awful digital compression sound to the tracks.  Great remaster job for an absolute classic, must-have album.

030746363X|4.0|Timothy Ferriss has a very engaging writing style (as anybody who has read the 4 hour work week can attest to), and packs this book full of useful gems to help improve your physical prowess.  I especially like the anecdotal interaction with the myriad specialists he recruits in his search of knowledge.  The only reason I am not giving this book a 5 out of 5 is the poor flow between sections of the book; certain chapters seem to be re-hashed blog posts inserted into the book with little editing.  Having said that, I did enjoy the read, and would definitely recommend it.
B005SAP45I|5.0|The opening scene is of a secret car agent jumping from a boat with magnetic tires scaling a vertical support on an oil platform.  So ridiculous it's hilarious!  Don't worry, you'll soon get absorbed in the parallel world of cars.  Remember, guys, it's a kids animated movie - cars can't really talk (and neither can toys or animals).  Just forget about it and have fun.  Your kids will love it.
1451648537|4.0|Overall this book is a pretty good look at Steve Jobs, which is good for somebody not real familiar with his life. As some of the other reviewers noted its not so much about the tech stuff Jobs was involved with so much as about his life and how he fit into the computer world. Its pretty much a \\"warts and all\\" book and doesn't slavishly praise Jobs without mentioning some of his faults, like his tendency to be a tyrant toward people who didn't live up to his idea of perfection. Anyway, if your new to Jobs this book is a pretty good read.
1423113454|3.0|The book started out slow and somewhat confusing. I've read other Riordan books/series and liked them and I guess I had too high expectations for this one. Before reading anymore of this series I'll check to see if they're written in the same style and if so probably won't read them.
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|This movie is awful. I think Nicolas, and Nicole did this strictly for the money.  I'm surprised at Ms. Kidman as she seems to have stayed away from this sort of film. After seeing Mr.Cage's last few films, sadly I'm not surprised.   Your typical \\"Home Invasion\\" thriller.   Who puts up the money for this awful stuff? They must make it back on the rentals.  Skip this one.
0756404738|5.0|The Name of the Wind was perhaps one of the greatest fantasy novels ever written, especially in my eyes. Its sequel, The Wise Man's Fear, continues the amazing story within a story of Kvothe.   I cannot say enough good things about this novel, its prose is entertaining and heart beating, its love scenes are nicely fleshed out, its action scenes are pulse pounding. Pat really does know how to write a good story, and I know how to read a good story.  Many people complain that Kvothe goes from very, very..very shy in the first book, to a downright player in this one. It's true, all of it. It made me angry a little bit, but it does happen in real life. People change, that's all that's happening. Kvothe is growing up, we just have to deal with it.  The story remains excellent and I love the cast of characters, except Kvothe and Bast are douches sometimes and to me Denna is a whore, but I digress.  I love this book, best written in a long time.:D
B004W2UBYW|4.0|My assessment the \\"short version\\" - it was hard to put this book down! Very interesting writing style, very descriptive and honest, certainly, since we see some very dark and uncomplimentary sides to Steve Jobs.   Long version:  First, I will reiterate what a few other people have said - technologically speaking, there are some pretty broad assumptions made by the author. Some are subjective but others just don't quite jive with existing facts. Or statistics are chosen which show Apple in a glossy light. When one talks about iPhone's dominance, you have to consider the market - iPhone has never really exceeded around 20% market share, and Android has already passed 40%.   Second, how the heck did Bill Gates become a nice guy? Given what I know about the IT world (have been an IT professional for over 15 years) - and having read prior biographies of Bill Gates - he comes out sounding like a saint. Cordial, sometimes whimsical, patient and even self-effacing. What about the guy who ruthlessly bought out competitors, ripped off Netscape to the point of bankrupting the company (and MS eventually lost the monopoly suit, btw!). Anyway - it just struck me as odd. Like, the biographer's next subject might just be Bill Gates.  Third, we get to see a vision of Steve Jobs, warts and all, though some of Jobs' technological failings are under-represented, most obviously is his venture with NExT. The company existed for 11 years, but is only really mentioned in a few chapters in the book. I also didn't really buy the explanation of the antenna issue on the iPhone 4 back when Steve Jobs shrugged it off, and I didn't buy it when I read it again in the biography.  Fourth, I, like many other reviewers, got a good feel of the anecdotes and very detailed stories that he relates in the book, but very little commentary from the biographer. He doesn't help us connect some of the dots that would form a more cohesive picture of Steve Jobs. Twenty years of marriage, and I feel we hear almostmore about Jobs' earlier loves than we do about his actual wife, at least until the time the author was visiting the family regularly over the last two years of Jobs' life.  I never really got how Jobs was able to avoid getting tickets all the time when he never put a license plate on his cars. We read about passing references to some vacation spots, but I would have loved to have gotten more of the personal details of Jobs life and times and a bit less about Apple.  ***********  If I were to summarize, since we read so much about the various people who influenced Apple Computers both while Jobs worked there and when he did not, it felt more like we were reading a biography of Apple Computers - with intimate viewpoints of the creator of the company  - than we were reading a biography of Steve Jobs.  Again, extremely gripping reading, extremely well told. Just a different focus from what one might expect.
B005F96UNM|5.0|Watched \\"Bunraku\\" last night. I think it is awesomer than awesome! The animation is stunning, and combined with live action, is pretty incredible. Yeah, I know there are lots of movies that do that, but the art style and the physical sets are beautiful. I've read some really negative reviews for this film, and I don't think they get it! It's a \\"graphic novel\\" style movie, but the best one I've seen. You could pause on any frame of the film, and it looks like a graphic novel. The lighting and art direction are spectacular. It's like \\"live\\" Anime! So ignore the reviews, and watch the film!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Great fun. Sat it down for a week and wasn't lost when I came back. Old school RPG fans will be at home from the first second.
0887307280|5.0|Every business minded individual should be read this book! There is a lot of information that sounds so simple yet don't let that take away from its effectiveness. It is incredibly profound and instrumental in all successful small businesses.   The style in which it is written was also a huge plus. I still remember when this was an assigned reading for a business consulting class. I made the mistake of opening it up late one night and found it so profound and engaging that I literally stayed up all night until it was read. Never before and never again was this the case in my long collegiate experience. :)
B005G4TJUC|5.0|This movie was epic! I really loved all of the fight scenes and I enjoyed all of the new Autobots! Autobots all the way! The new girl really added a new dimension to the movie and I was glad that it was someone other than Megan Fox this time!
0807014273|5.0|Do you know how some principles are so true that they are literally universal? Regardless of what language you speak, what country you live in, what stage of life you are in, what your values and priorities are, this is one of those books that has immense value!  Viktor E. Frankl reveals the keys to your own life and elegantly shows you the unique advantages we as humans possess if we are only courageous enough to use them.
B0050UEVU0|4.0|Actor Jason Statham lays off the marshal arts gymnastics and takes an excellent thespian turn as Brant a detective who becomes involved with a cop serial killer played with just the right amount of sleaze by Aiden Gillen.  Statham teams with another officer played by Paddy Considine to take him down dodging the obstacles placed in front of them by their own judicial system.  Director Elliot Lester gives the film a gritty look showing the downside of the British scene resembling Director Harry Barber's excellent Michael Caine film 'HARRY BROWN'.  It's good to see Statham in a different light and is a must for all his fans. This version from Millennium Entertainment that I viewed releases the film in a crisp 2.35 transfer with no extras.  Good to pop back a few bottles of Bass ale and chill out to this good two-fisted crime yarn.
0321344758|5.0|Although most of the things mentioned in the book are just plain common sense, I'd still recommend it to anyone who works in the web industry.
B0036TGT3E|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid and I still truly enjoy it. The picture quality is great. Great Buy.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|Strictly Ballroom, the first of Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain Trilogy, is fast paced and so captivating, that it's hard to look away.  He combines the world of ballroom dance in Australia with quick cuts and fun angles, that gives a whole new look into cinematography.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Great job on the remastering.  Love the sounds, especially from the older albums.  In the Immersion DSotM box, there were a handful of collectors cards.  Seems like you get more with other purchases.  However, there were none in the Discovery Box Set that I received.  I purchased the Japanese version, which is the same as the US except for the additional Japanese languqge inserts with translated lyrics, etc.  So where does one find additional card in the set?  I'm assuming the WYWH and Wall immersion box sets will have some, but that won't cover the whole set...  hmm.  I vote for a remastered release of the early best of's (Nice Pair, Works, Collection/Dance) for the great artwork, different tracks, and Embryo.  Lastly, the Why Pink Floyd campaign needs to release one full remastered concert from each tour.  Especially would love a clean rendition of The Amazing Pudding with their haunting voice work.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I haven't had any of the problems other people have listed. The graphics are beautiful. It always has my correct location. I have no problems with it updating, and I love having the Oklahoma earthquake data.
1849162751|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest continues the story in Larsson's two previous books and is just as exciting and fun to read as they were. It's a book that is hard to put down. The main characters, while somewhat quirky, are likable and you find yourself rooting for them.  There is a wonderful sense of mystery as the book slowly reveals their secrets.
034552554X|5.0|The topic of children in foster care is so delicate and generally misunderstood.  Ms Diffenbauch  handled the hardships and lasting damage beautifully.
B004V0JKKG|2.0|I found it extremely hard to continue reading, the characters that once held my interest have since been eliminated, the only reason I read it throughout was simply to complete the series.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|I've been listening to 'Bad As Me' through headphones. My early take is that it's Waits' best record since 'Mule Variations.' As with all of his records, I'm letting it soak in. To anyone on the fence about buying it, I say, \\"Pull the trigger.\\" This is definitely one of his better efforts and every Waits fan needs this one!
B004R739LE|5.0|This is a well constructed photographer's day pack.  The bottom section has adjustable dividers to hold you camera, a couple of moderate-sized lenses and a flash unit....what you can stick in there depends on the size of each piece. The dividers and the pack exterior are made of foam wrapped in nylon to protect everything from the occasional bump and scrape.<br /><br />The top section is your standard pack...a mesh pocket to hold keys and the other debris that would drift to the bottom and a section for lunch or whatever else you need.<br /><br />To make a (not very) long story short...if you need something like this, buy it.  I've been using the DayPack for a couple of weeks now and really like it.
B004BLTNJI|1.0|Amazon needs to change the picture and description since it says you get the dvd, digital copy, and regular blu-ray, along with the 3D versions (2 discs, 4 formats). I only got the 3D blu-ray in this set! The cover didn't even match the picture, as mine only said blu-ray 3D and nothing on the back said otherwise.  If it is written on here as two discs and 4 formats then it will confuse consumers. The support I spoke with said that it's been happening frequently and that they probably don't have the version the website says they have.  I ordered from another vendor.  C'mon, Amazon!  This appears to be a habit you are forming (see same type issue in the reviews for the Toy Story 3D multi-disc/multi-format Blu-ray).
B003Q6D282|2.0|What makes the Saw movies interesting aren't the traps or gore, but Tobin Bell's Jigsaw.  The moral complexity.  The questions of what a person will do to survive.  It was a kind gross out vigilante horror film and it worked.  Saw: The Final Chapter loses that little complexity that the franchise has, and lacks any coherent story.  There are no clever tricks in the narrative, no real gotcha moment that were present in earlier entries of this series.  It's simply gave in to being torture porn and that's all you get.  Trap after trap that can't be beaten, each one grosser than its predecessor.  The films were never genius film-making, but there was always a subversive sense of fun in Jigsaw's traps being a kind vigilante justice.  With that gone, all that's left is the morbid effects. Effects don't make a movie, and as a movie, this is a lousy one.  Even hardcore fans should be wary.  There's nothing here worth watching.
B004N6369Y|1.0|I have read all of Danielle Steels books along with thousands of other books and this is the first   review I have ever written. I have always loved Steel but recently her books have become mundane ... boring ... no plot ... and not worth the good money we pay. Sorry to say but this is the last Steel book I will waste my money on. Sad to see Steel decline.
B005804NCI|5.0|Now this is what I think SACD should be! Fleetwood Mac's original engineer went back to the multitrack masters to create this big, bold, very musical mix of a recording that really deserves the \\"classic\\" banner. Ken Caillat's original, stereo version (produced by Fleetwood Mac and Richard Dashut) was already pretty nice (I owned the LP version issued by Nautilus in the '70's), but SACD has at least as much clarity as the original LP and allows the instruments room to breathe since they are no longer crammed into 2 channels. I'd forgotten how brilliant the band's arrangements were until I rediscovered \\"Rumours\\" while listening to this version.<br /><br />The mix uses the rear channels at times to stunning effect, including added guitar on \\"Never Going Back Again,\\" although the front 3 channels host most of the action. The background is quiet enough to allow the dynamics of John MacVeigh's bass to come through with a striking amount of weight in \\"The Chain\\" and that's only one of many highlights. If you enjoy listening to music as an experience rather than as background sound, consider this disc!<br /><br />The only disappointment is the booklet, which has minimal artwork and lacks the colorful liner notes on the 2-CD anniversary edition. It does include the complete lyrics.
B004RPKUTU|5.0|When this book opens you will find fascinating things on the very first page. After a half quarter of the book weirdness and spookiness would enter the story. Right in the middle you would find the main character just being in the middle of very important words and actions that are on the hook of live over death. At the end....oh I won't tell you! Read this book and then you'll find out in a more detailed version of the actual story.        I read this book as a part of a group in my class's Novel Study unit. When I read this book there were many things to discover and think about. I had predictions when I was reading and after I read. Nothing could have been better than this book for our unit. If you like books with juicy details, when good and evil clash together and fight, moments of triumphs, and  pleasure and joy than this is your book! I hope you enjoy it when you read it! :
B005FLX2WC|4.0|I had never heard of Beth hurt. It was a recommendation from Amazon. I like the c.d.   She has pipes for sure. There are times,they sound like a real good bar band,but her voice is majestic. i will not compare her to those that have come before her,for her voice is her own.  All in all i like it.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Darryl Hannah and Tom Hanks were great in the movie. John Candy is classic in it as well. Buy this one and youll thoroughly enjoy it. I even named my  daughter after the movie. Madison..Love that name!!
B0036IGJ1C|3.0|I think this was a good book.  It had some insights in to living a life of faith but the style was trite and a little too pedestrian.
1451648537|1.0|Apple sucks.  Steve Jobs just took out of date technology put it in a white case and then suddenly it became \\"cool\\" and \\"mainstream\\".  They also charged ridiculous prices for things.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I have never been so disappointed and angery, after reading this entire series,  as when I was served up this crappy ending. The author has cheated his readers.
0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games was a great book.  It was the first book in a long time that I just couldn't put down.  I actually picked up Hunger Games on a whim at a nice discount when a bookstore went out of business.  I am so glad I did!<br /><br />The story line is based in a post-apocalyptic world where all that remains of the US are the capital and 12 districts.  Each district specializes in providing somethng for the capital (coal, food, jewels, etc).  The other thing each district must provide is a boy and girl between the age of 12 and 18 to go into the Hunger Games.  A battle to the death between all the selections where only the sole survivor goes free.<br /><br />Is it the most original plot? No.  It contains elements of The Long Walk and THe Running Man by Stephen King, Battle Royale out of Japan, movies like Condemned, and of coarse the gladiator games of ancient Rome.  But the author does add her own elements and created a world I could see and a character I could root for.  The book was a turn pager packed full of action and excitement.<br /><br />I haven't read the second or thrid books yet but I am purchasing them tonight.
B001HN6922|1.0|The movie was fun enough, but in reponse to J. Kitsinger's review...why the viewers behind him seemed to hate it, was probably because they saw the same hidden messages in it that I did.  I doubt that it was their dismay over Bond movies...I myself, love Bond movies and can't wait for the new one next year.  No, it is the new Hollywood messaging system playing out upon unsuspecting viewers.  Oh, they are subtle enough, and most viewers probably wouldn't even notice, or care.  Did you even notice that the bad guys were Gremlins and Pacers?  Those are \\"American Motors\\" cars, or may I say, Hollywood's view that the bad guys in this world are Americans.  Cars 2 is not the only movie that Hollywood used to send along their viewpoints.  Did you notice that the Chinese were the heros in \\"2012\\"?  At the end (the last scene)of the movie \\"Knowing\\", did you notice the tree that the little boy and little girl ran towards?  It is a reference to the Bible's \\"Tree of Knowledge\\", or, \\"time to pick the fruit and let the sin begin\\".  There is no reason for Hollywood to use these images, as others, or none at all could be substituted, but it is becoming clearer to me that Hollywood is getting their message out, and we're standing in line willing to pay for it.  I am sure there are other things I missed in current movies, but I am sure the viewers behind J. Kitsinger saw what I saw, which spoiled the whole movie for them.  As for myself, I just make note of it.  I gave the movie one star because of this.  Hollywood gripes about political correctness yet they throw it back on us, the viewers.  Hollywood needs to get out of politics and religion, and just concentrate on entertainment like they did back in the beginning of motion pictures.  I did buy this movie however, as I liked most of it, and it goes with \\"cars\\" on my shelf, but I really don't know why I should have, as I noticed this in the theater first.
B003Y5H57E|3.0|Loved this movie in theaters and ordered very excited to see a digital copy included.  I didn't know that this \\"Ultraviolet copy\\" would be such a pain and can't play on my ipad without an internet connection.  I hope hollywood wakes up asap and realizes customers don't want this!

B005UPOAT2|5.0|This is a fantastic movie!  Everytime it comes on both my husband and I watch it.  I like John Cusack and he likes Kate Beckinsale.  But both actor & actress in this movie work great together.  It funny, romatic clean and fun.  I would recommend this to anyone to watch over and over again...
B004GYY714|5.0|Just downloaded free version to check it out. I was surprised to see all of my local stations and then some. It even has a sleep timer and alarm radio. The paid version allows you to record stations. This is a keeper
B0049OSQ18|5.0|This album is great!  And the bonus disk on how they recorded the tracks in a barn shows how musically savy this band is.  It is by far my new favorite album...
076781326X|5.0|[[ASIN:B000AA4JMK Oliver (With CD Premium  Giftset]]  This is certainly the kind of movie that you must see OVER and OVER and OVER again!! It's the academy award winning motion picture for 1968. It's an excellent musical filled with robust, foot stomping, appauding show tunes that will live with you forever. Movies ARE NOT made like this today. It's sheer family fun without the usual nasty words. Yes, a must see and a must have family keepsake!
B005IGVYUG|4.0|There's no doubt that Tom has come up with an awesome LP. Being a fan I shelled out a few more dollars for three extra tracks and a \\"40 page book\\". Three tracks - OK, but the book is just the lyrics and a couple of photos. Not sure what I was expecting but it was something more here.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|Halloween II (the original) seems to be the one in the series that gets lost in the mix. I've heard that it's mainly due to ownership rights. Hopefully one day, Anchor bay will release a version packed with bonuses and commentary. Until that day happens, this one will do fine.<br /><br />The deleted scenes were a nice feature as well as the addition of \\"terror in the aisles\\". Don't expect to be blown away by the picture quality just because it's Blu Ray. Just expect to see the movie and remember why you got hooked in the first place.
B0018PJEYY|5.0|I received this CD on time.  It was new as advertised.  I would not hesitate to order again from vendor.  What more needs to be said?
0142001104|5.0|I was turned onto this book because I had seen Mr. Zander speak at the TED talks forums. It is a truly inspirational read, and a very quick one. Books like this can tend to get \\"heady\\" and seemingly technical sometimes, but this one is very straight ahead. It gets right to the point, and as I mentioned, is a very quick read...I finished it in 2 days but will carry the practices for a life time.  If anyone is curious as to the \\"vibe\\" of this book, simply go to youtube and search for the Bill Zander TED talk and you'll know what this book is all about.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Absolutely love love the show!! Shipping was quick, dvd in great condition (new in package) and played wonderfully. Many friends have already borrowed and now hooked! Love it, can't wait to buy next season!

0743298039|3.0|I loved the beginning of this novel, and even copied, word for word, several passages about the power and importance of stories.  Great beginning.<br /><br />The rest lagged for me, bogged down in beautiful but too-long descriptions, repetitions, and bulky transitions.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the dark and twisty plot and the strange characters.  If only it had moved a little faster and ended a little less Hollywood (for example, it's not a love story, but Setterfield just has to throw in a love interest for the narrator at the end.  Probably her agent demanded it.  Fie on you, Hollywood.)
B0059XTUMC|5.0|The moment I saw this at the Cannes Film Festival back in May, I knew that this film, \\"The Artist,\\" would be either an incredible motion picture or a failed attempt at a genre extremely rare in today's movie society. After that thought, I sat down and watched the movie. The first words I blurted out when the film was over was \\"Wow!\\" I was speechless by this film. For the next few hours, when I was at my hotel room, I just sat down and thought about what I just saw. Overall, what I'm saying is this was a phenomenal motion pciture! I loved it so much, I went to other film festivals just to see it again. And you can bet I'm going to see this when it's in theaters. The acting, the cinematography, the sound, it was all perfect. Now if you don't know by now, \\"The Artist\\" is a colorless AND silent movie. Yes, silent movie. A word most modern moviegoers do not even comprehend. Even though that might be a turnoff for some, it wasn't for me, as I have seen plenty of silent films. My one problem wih the film is that when it is released in theaters (which will be during the last week of November 2011,) it will have a limited release. And I thought to myself \\"Why!?\\" Why won't they release this film to everyone, not just certain cities. Oh well. It might have a wide release for one reason- awards. This film has already gathered plenty of film festival awards- and it's just waiting for Golden Globes, Oscars, and other major film awards. I GARUNTEE you that this will be nomianted for the Best Picture Oscar. It's already on my list as one of the best films of the year. Now then, say if you're a future reader (after the 2012 Oscar awards and the DVD is out), I hope it has won (or at least have been nominated) for Best Picture. If you just want to see this movie because it's been nominated for the Oscar and won it (hopefully) then sure. Even if this film isn't nominated for Best Picture (which in my eyes seems impossible) I still highly recommend. I give it a 9.5/10.
0307593312|2.0|I usually enjoying reading long books and I usually enjoy reading Murakami, unfortunately, 1Q84 failed to capture my interest. At around page 646 I was ready to throw the book out the window. This novel is desperately in need of an editor, but apparently Mr. Murakami is such a well regarded author that nobody dared suggest any cuts.  The continuous repetitions made the novel grotesquely simplistic and without meaning. If this is supposed to be a novel of ideas, or an updated version of Orwell it fails.
B00000IUP4|1.0|Adorable, easy-to-use. all that and a bag of chips.  But as the first reveiewer notes, this is not a toy that can be rolled back and forth on the floor and then set loose on the tracks.  Once your child has rolled it around manually by hand, the gears are ruined.  You may get one or two weeks out of it, and then it is kaput.  Not only are the trains expensive, but batteries only last about an hour.  One day my four-year-old started screaming while I was in the kitchen.  I ran to him to find the train running, and his hair twisting into its wheels.  After frantically ripping his hair out of the wheels while simultanelously trying to turn the damn thing off, I turned the train car over to see a tiny sticker on the bottom. It read:   CAUTION: Hair entanglement may result if child's head is too close to wheels.\\"  Now that my boy is 6 1/2, I am buying him his FOURTH of these battery-powered trains.  I think he is finally mature enough.  The other FOUR electric trains I got him were broken w/in one month, or ended up in his hair.
