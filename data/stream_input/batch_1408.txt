B003YL4KS0|5.0|This is a must read for every girl with curls who has ever been dismayed by frizz, longed for straight hair or felt she was losing a battle against her curls.  At last I have the hair I have always wanted!  I was an immediate convert when I read the book and saw results with my hair even before I switched my products to sulfate free - just by changing my techniques.  I can't say how long it will take to see results on damaged hair.  My hair was already fairly healthy as I rarely blow dried it anyway and was shampooing only weekly.  But even healthy, I hated it.  Frizz was my every day nemesis.  Winter dry frizz, summer humid frizz, windy frizz, etc.  Can't say I never have frizz now, but I absolultely have gorgeous curls that make me smile every time I see them.  Thanks Lorraine!!! and thanks to Chuck, my amazing hair guy who pointed me in the right direction!!!
0446547654|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is by far one of my favorite authors ever. That being said, I rated this one more harshly than other books because I expected something that would make me laugh, cry, and sigh with how amazing the love is, like all of his other books did. Sadly, I could only give this one four stars. The fist thing that just didn't do it for me was the romance between Dawson and Amanda. I could tell they loved each other by the recap of their past and how they fell in love, but the present time in the book that they spent together didn't radiate the normal, intense passion that has been in his other books. I really enjoyed the main characters but I didn't connect with them. I wish we could have actually read about them falling in love in high school because then their love would have been more real 20 years down the road. So I was a bit bored in the first half of the book because I expected more passion and drama than what I actually got. The second half of the book, though, is what really saved the story. So many things happen that my heart was actually racing because I was so anxious to figure out what was going to happen next. Once the initial twist happened though, the book was slightly predictable so I knew what was going to happen in the last chapter of the book well before it actually occurred. Because of this, I didn't cry like I have in many of Sparks' other books, but I was still happy with the ending (though I would have been happier with a happier ending...). So overall The Best of Me was a very enjoyable book, but I didn't fall in love with it like I have with all of his other books. I still can't wait to see what they do with the movie for this! Yet another Nicholas Sparks creation to look forward too :)
B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA is a solid record.  It always takes a little time for a new Madonna album to really sink in, and this one was no different.  After a week of nonstop listening, my early favorites are \\"I'm Addicted\\" and \\"I'm A Sinner.\\"  The production on the songs sounds amazing as well.  I've always been a sucker for Madonna's party music, so I find MDNA to be incredibly listenable from beginning to end.  It's interesting to hear some of her thoughts on the Guy divorce put to music, especially on tracks like \\"Best Friend.\\"  I think it was Rolling Stone that mentioned that Madonna shows us her human side on this album.  I agree.  I was in the minority in 2008 when Hard Candy dropped...because I loved it.  I still love it.  In my opinion, Madonna consistently puts out great pop music.  Long live the queen.<br /><br />One last thing.  Why are people allowed to post \\"reviews\\" when they haven't listened to the album?  I read one review based on 30-second clips.  That's like reviewing a new film based on a trailer.  It skews the rating here at Amazon and doesn't make much sense.  Hope the rules will change on that, because it's not a fair representation of the music.<br /><br />Go buy MDNA, you'll enjoy it.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I like the factory browser better.  Dolphin has added features but has a really poor visual interface.  By that I mean small print, poor layout of pages and difficult to read with.  On the other hand my Smamsug came with a simple browser that formats news article so I can read the by itself, no gestures needed.  So, use Dolphin if you like features that are unnecessary on other browsers.

B00756GKBA|2.0|I hadn't actually purchased a Madonna album in about 10 years but for some reason I picked up on this one!  I've heard big portions of some of the recent albums and didn't like much or any of what I heard!  The first 10 songs on this CD are total crap!  More of the techno Brittney Spears dance crap (or whatever you call it).  To be honest I'm not sure what you would call it, junk!  What's surprising is that there are songs on the album I actually like which start with track 11 Masterpiece, and the several ballads on the rest of the album are actually listenable.  The rest of the album includes the bonus material (i guess) since the regular album would end with track 12.  Track 13 is actually a pretty good song too, Beautiful Killer (uptempo song quit pleasant).  Seems Madonna started this album on track 11.  The rest of the album was just another attempt to sound like modern 2000's Brittney pop.  And yes I hate Brittney Spears and her music so it's not a good comparison. I actually love The Birthday Song, wow now this reminds me of the 80's, a Madonna dance (disco) style dance song that's CATCHY as hell.  I haven't liked one this much in a long time!  So from track 11 on, I actually like most of this album!  Too bad the whole album wasn't that good because the first 10 songs should not have been on any album.  Enough said!

0670023329|5.0|This is outstanding book can be read in one or two sittings.  Harden has written a book that compares very well to Aquariums of Pyongyang and Long Road Home. The writing is sharp and tight, and the tone is very understated.  When Shin escaped from Camp 14, he was more like an animal who excelled at survival (informing on others, including his mother and brother which led to their being hanged, and shot), and most interested in his next meal.  The last chapter does give hope that Shin may one day be able to function as a full human being, capable of balanced emotions and gaining ability to trust others.  Perhaps an updated edition in the future may prove to be an interesting reading.<br /><br />Also, if there is an updated edition in the future, I encourage Harden to revise the following section.  On p. 182, he writes, \\"U.S. immigration law grants special consideration to North Korean refugees, and Shin's unique status as a born and bred victim of a political prison camp gave him an excellent chance of obtaining permanent residency in the United States.  But he did not apply for a green card.\\"<br />Later, on p. 188, Harden writes that Shin has gone back to China on behalf of his new NGO he set up called North Korea Freedom Plexus.  When Harden asked whether he was worried about being abducted by North Korean agents, \\"[Shin] said that he has the protection of a South Korean passport .  .  .\\"<br /><br />According to current law, as a South Korean citizen (conferred when he went to South Korea from China), Shin is not eligible for asylum (what Harden calls \\"green card\\"). The Board of Immigration Appeals, in  Matter of K-R-Y- & K-C-S-, 24 I&N Dec. 133 (BIA 2007), ruled as such:<br /><br />\\"(1) The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-333, 118 Stat. 1287, which provides that North Koreans cannot be barred from eligibility for asylum on account of any legal right to citizenship they may enjoy under the Constitution of South Korea, does not apply to NorthKoreans who have availed themselves of the right to citizenship in South Korea.<br /><br />(2) The respondents, natives of North Korea who became citizens of South Korea, are precluded from establishing eligibility for asylum as to North Korea on the basis of their firm resettlement in South Korea.\\"<br /><br />I do not think there is a special asylum eligibility for those who are \\"born and bred victims of a political prison camp.\\"  Shin would be considered to be a South Korean citizen for asylum purposes.<br /><br />*The 2007 BIA decision is wrong, and should be vacated by U.S. Courts of Appeal or the Attorney General.<br />---<br />Addendum<br />Went to Korea Society 4/12/12 event featuring Harden and Shin.  Very informative and moving. Shin talked a lot more about his experiences and thoughts than I had anticipated.  Shin had prepared a short remark about why every time he visits Washington DC, he goes to the Holocaust Museum. In response to questions, Shin gave very thoughtful and multi-part answers to questions.

B0050AV5MW|5.0|I simply adored this book and cannot wait to read more of this magical world where hardship and injustice is as real as the weather.  This story will engage most from the get go.  The only people I would advise not to read the book is those who do not like detail.  This is a very detailed book and by the end you feel as if you know the characters personally.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Let me start by explaining exactly what kind of SK fan I am.....a newish one.  I have tried over the years to read several of his works but only succeeded in getting through  The green mile...but then came Lisey's story; and to my surprise SK was now the author of my  new favorite book.  I am an avid reader with an expansive range of \\"favorites\\"(love pat conroy, love david rosenfelt, love cody mcfadyen, love frank mccourt, love sydney sheldon).  Next I read Duma Key and was enthralled (loved the humor!!) And then came 11/22/63...I have already read it twice!  What an amazing story!  Since then I have begun to go back and read more SK thinking if he can write three of my favorite books I must have missed something before..turns out I had....Under the Dome and the Stand were very entertaining (not to the level of the previously mentioned 3 but still good).  I enjoyed-ish Bag of Bones, hated dead zone and am almost done with From a Buick 8 (only so-so).  I have come to appreciate SK's style of writing and believe it to be worth the risk (some are duds yes, but the winners knock your literary socks off)  If you can relate to my reading style and evaluations then you can trust my review and buy this book.  I envy you the days ahead...lost in a new/old world with a witty, imaginative guide.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I've been using the wireless remote (ML-L3, $17) on my D90 for about a year I guess, before I finally decided to get this remote.  Why did I wait! I do a lot of tripod photography and had been using the 2sec timer, or the wireless remote.  This remote is far easier.. just plug and click at the EXACT moment that you want the pic.  I'll still use the wireless remote for certain shots (family portrait or when I am not physically at the camera) but from now on I'll be using this little gadget a lot.<br /><br />I nearly went for the cheap copy (for as little as $3 on amazon!) but decided to stick with the Nikon product... seriously, how much did you pay for your camera?? Spend the $25 and get the Nikon accessories. I've got all types of after-market stuff for different cameras and camcorders.. some good, some not so good.  If this remote was $50 then I might have made a different decision, but why risk damaging your electrical port or having other reliability problems for the price of a few Starbucks visits? I don't know the $3 versions are necessarily inferior, but for the money involved I'm not willing to take the risk.

0060558121|4.0|Although I gave this book \\"only\\" 4 stars, in reality I wish Amazon had a feature so I could give it 4.5, which is what I feel it truly deserves.<br /><br />American Gods is among the longest of Neil Gaiman's novels. Possibly because of this, I found it to be slower paced than Neverwhere, with a slightly meandering storyline in places, including one segment roughly in the middle where the main character, Shadow, is left to live in a small town while his employer goes elsewhere. Despite such blips, American Gods retains the staples of Gaiman's writing. It is funny and imaginative, with great characters and an interesting plot, and what can only be described as excellent writing. It is a very solid novel, enjoyable and engrossing. Compared to Neverwhere and Anansi boys, which I feel are like this novel's cousins, this book is moderately more difficult. Instead of simply following Shadow, the book covers several points of view, and several time periods unrelated to the main plot, but which fill out the details of the background nicely.<br /><br />I think in particular, Gaiman's choice of setting in this book was a good one. The American Midwest isn't a setting commonly seen, at least in the books that I've read, and it gives the book a sense of otherness, while still keeping it firmly in the real world. Compounded by the vast numbers of mythical beings that populate the universe of American Gods, and you get a world that strikes a perfect balance of similarity and the unknown. We can relate to the characters and their situations, and yet still feel curious and mystified.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a great read. It's entertainment value is sky high, it's exciting, humorous, and once you get going you won't want to put the book down until the end. And at the end of the day, once you've finished the book, the great thing about the world Gaiman has created is that it sticks with you, and you almost wish that such things really did exist in our world too. When a book does that, and causes you to think about other mythology and folklore, and even look them up because you're curious and wish to know more, it becomes more than a bit of fluff read for entertainment value alone. American Gods is a great read, and comes strongly recommended.s that, and causes you to think about other mythology and folklore, and even look them up because you're curious and wish to know more, it becomes more than a bit of fluff read for entertainment value alone.

0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere is in the interesting genre of fantasy that does not occur in a far away alternate universe, or where ancient forces of good and evil clash. Instead, it is set in our world. In London, in particular. With one tiny difference. In Neverwhere, as in many of Gaiman's stories, the legends and folklore are all real, and magical and supernatural beings still exist in the world, trying to make their way in while all around them modern life goes on.<br /><br />Neverwhere is the story of Richard Mayhew, a nice perfectly ordinary man, who unwittingly stumbles into this underground world. His struggle to escape it and return to his former way of living, the things he encounters, the decisions he makes, and the strange adventure he winds up in due to a single charitable act form the meat of plot, and are about the only details I can give without going into spoilers. Suffice it to say, the storyline is interesting, fascinating, and most crucially, fun. The characters are brilliant, as is the writing. Gaiman writes with an excellent brand of humor that begins with the very first chapter and does not let go until the novel is over. All in all, this is a light read, but don't think it is just for kids. This is something that anyone can enjoy, and if you are looking for something entertaining, funny, fun, and yet intriguing and interesting, this is a book you should most certainly pick up.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Interesting book that started out good, gained some momentum in the middle, only to fizzle out towards the end.  Cheesy filler lines began to replace the smooth story line that was present in the earlier parts of the book.  And, the end...well, that is where I was most disappointed.  It just left you flat.  I honestly thought I must have skipped the last page or something and flipped back and forth a couple of times.  But, alas, it was the ending and not a good one.  Would I recommend this book?  Yes, but with less enthusiasm than I originally anticipated.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|I have watched all parts of the Life series and was in awe with every one. I don't have a favorite or a least favorite, they were all fantastic. Producers of other programs should take note of the Life series to see how it should be done. The Life series is not for attention deficit people like most junk out there now. It slows the scenes down enough for the viewer to enjoy the beautiful photography and the fantastic high definition.

It also provided an interesting and informative history lesson into the rise of the personal computer and Apple's lead role in the process of revolutionizing human existence.  Jobs comes off as a difficult, eccentric and troubled man with poor relationships with his partners, competittors, colleagues.  His personal life was largely ignored - indeed, it seemed incomprehensible that the same man who was often just plain mean in dealing with his subordinates and colleagues did not exist at home.  Ultimately, the book depicted a unique individual, no holds barred, who helped revolutionize modern human society. The book is out however on whether his contribution is positive or negative. One must also wonder what else he would have contributed had he lived a longer life.

1401233384|1.0|Since 1985-86 and the creation of the \\"Event\\" comic with the advent of [[ASIN:1563897504 Crisis On Infinite Earths]] and [[ASIN:1904159834 Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]], comic fans have been inundated yearly with these \\"game-changing, status quo-shaking\\" multi-title crossovers that are supposed to ripple through the universe. To be clear, I haven't been a huge fan of these over the years because they always fall short of what they promise to do. However, occasionally, you do get something that promises change and actually follows through, at least for a year or so. More \\"minor\\" event comics like Marvel's SPIDER-ISLAND, THE DEATH OF SPIDER-MAN or DC's BLACKEST NIGHT/BRIGHTEST DAY books have actually changed things about the characters involved and made the architecture of their respective universes different.<br /><br />FLASHPOINT is NOT one of those comics.<br /><br />Geoff Johns, DC's current Chief Creative Officer, and EIC Dan DiDio saw the sinking revenue of comics, and frightened by a possible return to the dark sales era of the 1990's, decided to make a massive change for the DC Universe. They announced FLASHPOINT as a five-part series that would change the DC Universe forever, and once completed, it would leave the company with 52 major titles (simply dubbed \\"The New 52\\") that were going to reflect the new direction for the characters in the DC Universe, and it would even bring characters who had long been in DC's VERTIGO books into DC's mainstream titles. And with Johns heading up every major event comic over the last several years but one, and that was Grant Morrison's steamy mess of FINAL CRISIS, he decided to take the reins on this event, get superstar artist Andy Kubert, and create a new universe for DC characters to exist in.<br /><br />But it's not the lead-in to The New 52. This is merely another alternate universe that, when all the sound and fury is over, has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. Now, not too long ago Johns wrote the very successful (and well-written) GREEN LANTERN: REBIRTH, when he brought Hal Jordan back to life, DC basically gave him carte blanche. He went on to write GREEN LANTERN, and he was very good at that for a while, particularly during THE SINESTRO CORPS WAR, GREEN LANTERN SECRET ORIGIN, and BLACKEST NIGHT, but he also did INFINITE CRISIS, which while messy, wasn't awful. He also decided to do one more character that literally wasn't necessary, and wasn't even really wanted by the fans. He, and the Powers That Be at DC, despite the great sacrifice Barry Allen made for \\"the multiverse\\" way back in CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS, and the fans that embraced Wally West as the new Flash, felt that Barry should come back, and hence FLASH: REBIRTH. It's a totally needless resurrection of a beloved character that actually had more resonance being dead rather than alive. And the story of that series was a joke too. I would almost rather spoil it if you haven't read it because it will save you time you'll never get back, but I don't do spoilers. Suffice it to say, the main villain of the tale is the same main villain of FLASHPOINT. And the motivations make as little sense here in FLASHPOINT as they did in REBIRTH.<br /><br />Basically, all this is is an alternate timeline tale starring Barry Allen as he goes back in time to save his mother from her murderer. When he does that, the entire timeline has become a madhouse! IT'S A MAAAAAADHOUSE!!! There's no Superman; The Amazons (Wonder Woman) are at a war with The Atlanteans (Aquaman) that has cost millions of lives; the character Cyborg is apparently the only real hero in this universe, Oliver Queen never got out of the arms business, Abin Sur never died and thus Hal Jordan never became a Green Lantern, and Batman is killing criminals and has successfully turned Gotham City into a huge gambling town. Oh, and also of course, The Flash has never existed. As the series (and its several different tie-ins) continues, The Flash, Batman and Cyborg must team up to save this world. Yes, it's basically the worst possible place to live.<br /><br />What troubles me so much about this tale is that it actually has NO EFFECT on the actual DC Universe other than the merging of some Vertigo titles like HELLBLAZER, ANIMAL MAN and SWAMP THING, as well as WildStorm titles like STORMWATCH and GRIFTER into the main DC Universe. This supposedly kick-starts \\"The New 52\\", but only some of it. Characters like Batman, the Barbara Gordon Batgirl, Batwoman (basically every member of the Bat-Family) are unchanged, as well as Green Lantern. Other characters are changed, but the changes make no sense. Oh, and apparently, the current DC Universe has only taken place over the course of FIVE YEARS. One way to point out how incredibly stupid that is is that Batman has had five different Robins in five years, since they all exist in this universe (with the exception of Stephanie Brown, who despite having a very successful and very good solo comic as Batgirl, they didn't feel it was necessary to include her... which was a pretty sucky thing to do). Just think about that for as long as it takes to read this sentence. I'm sure it's clear to you as it is to me that the \\"five year\\" idea is amazingly moronic, but people who make lots of money and are supposed to be really smart and creative made this idea up, probably over a few weeks of meetings and then committed to it (which you have to admit takes some brass). Anyway, I digress from this actual book.<br /><br />Andy Kubert is an extraordinarily talented artist, but sadly his work is hamstrung by the deadlines this comic had to make sure it could get every little thing down in order to make thr projected date of the launch of The New 52. Frankly, the series is nothing more than a cash-grab and what's worse is that it's written like one. Johns is a very talented writer; don't get me wrong. I really like some of the stuff he's done. He seems to put a lot of time into everything, even if it's not terribly good. FLASHPOINT is so far in the wrong direction, and it doesn't even seem like it was something that any real thought or planning went into when you read it, despite the fact that all of the many tie-in series must have taken a great deal of planning and developing and writing and drawing. I hate to pun like this, but FLASHPOINT as an event comic is all flash and no substance.<br /><br />Aside from a few \\"Whoa!\\" moments, FLASHPOINT falls flat on its face from a storytelling perspective. It's a mish-mash of hackneyed ideas, lame characters, pointless motivation and a tremendously lackluster ending.<br /><br />This is not to say that everything about the FLASHPOINT event was bad, because it did yield two very good tie-in series; BATMAN: KNIGHT OF VENGEANCE from Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Rizzo, which can be found in [[ASIN:1401234054 Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint Featuring Batman]], and PROJECT: SUPERMAN, a series over-seen by DC's very best writer, Scott Snyder, and done by Lowell Francis and Gene Ha found in [[ASIN:1401234348 Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint Featuring Superman]]. These were two excellent series borne out of a steaming hot mess, which makes FLASHPOINT the exception to the rule that necessity is the mother of invention.<br /><br />At least when you go back in time to save that mother and end up creating a really, really awful alternate timeline.t team up to save this world. Yes, it's basically the worst possible place to live.<br /><br />What troubles me so much about this tale is that it actually has NO EFFECT on the actual DC Universe other than the merging of some Vertigo titles like HELLBLAZER, ANIMAL MAN and SWAMP THING, as well as WildStorm titles like STORMWATCH and GRIFTER into the main DC Universe. This supposedly kick-starts \\"The New 52\\", but only some of it. Characters like Batman, the Barbara Gordon Batgirl, Batwoman (basically every member of the Bat-Family) are unchanged, as well as Green Lantern. Other characters are changed, but the changes make no sense. Oh, and apparently, the current DC Universe has only taken place over the course of FIVE YEARS. One way to point out how incredibly stupid that is is that Batman has had five different Robins in five years, since they all exist in this universe (with the exception of Stephanie Brown, who despite having a very successful and very good solo comic as Batgirl, they didn't feel it was necessary to include her... which was a pretty sucky thing to do). Just think about that for as long as it takes to read this sentence. I'm sure it's clear to you as it is to me that the \\"five year\\" idea is amazingly moronic, but people who make lots of money and are supposed to be really smart and creative made this idea up, probably over a few weeks of meetings and then committed to it (which you have to admit takes some brass). Anyway, I digress from this actual book.<br /><br />Andy Kubert is an extraordinarily talented artist, but sadly his work is hamstrung by the deadlines this comic had to make sure it could get every little thing down in order to make thr projected date of the launch of The New 52. Frankly, the series is nothing more than a cash-grab and what's worse is that it's written like one. Johns is a very talented writer; don't get me wrong. I really like some of the stuff he's done. He seems to put a lot of time into everything, even if it's notterribly good.

B005WZZRD8|5.0|This package is a collection of proof from a multi expressionist artist.<br />Although it may appear that there are some simillairities with other musical artists it's still GaGa style. She got this unique voice to give you a smile on your face or a tear in your eye.<br />The DVD resambles the same artistique qualities.<br />If you may not like Lady GaGa, for the other half sure this is an excellent historic Document.
0446573019|4.0|Zero Day was a fun read, with lots of action. The author obviously did a great deal of research into the U.S. Army CID and nuclear weaponry but does not bog the reader down in either. His protagonist, John Puller, is a bit too much Super Hero but Zero Day is, after all, fiction. Puller comes across as a mix between Lee Child's Jack Reacher and Nelson DeMille's Paul Brenner (The General's Daughter and Up Country) and, because of that, Puller never quite establishes himself as his own character. But I still enjoyed the read.
B003U6BE8I|2.0|The movie was a very good movie if it wasn't based on a book. Isn't Annabeth suppose to have blond hair? Where are the strawberry fields? What about the fight with Ares? The quest? And I am very disappointed they didn't mention Thalia's tree or even the prophecy. Although it was a good movie, they ruined the detail in the book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Outstanding..... I couldn't put the book down.  This is a great book, I'm looking forward to the second book.  This is a great book--addicting.

B005COO1X6|1.0|I thought this was a novel, not a short story. Too expensive for the length of the story?  The story was good, but wouldve liked it to be longer.
B001DF68MA|5.0|My daughter loves to ride in this seat.  The seat was very easy to attach to my bike (hybrid) and with the turn of one knob you can easily remove it.  I do agree with some other reviewers that you do have to bow your legs out so your knees don't bump into the seat.  However, the benefit of seeing and talking to my daughter while we ride is well worth it.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|Well if you're looking for a movie about backyards country folk with modern day evil and naiveness this is the movie. It really will have you laughing from start to finish. Definitely worth watching!

B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Bought this set along with the large castle decal.  The two coordinate well with each other.  There are a lot of different decals in this set.  Installation was easy, just need to use your imagination with placement.  My daughter loves it, and I'm sure she would recommend it to all of her friends.
B000063147|5.0|This is a fun album to listen to. And the lyrics are actually very meaningful and deep. This is Avenged Sevenfold's debut album. They were probably 16 when they came up with these lyrics and music parts. I don't know how others feel about M. Shadows's voice, but I think it sounds great. Very brutal screams, and he can really hit those high notes. Like many of their lyrics from future albums, there is biblical content. Like in the songs 'To End The Rapture' and 'Darkness Surrounding'. This album is mostly screaming, with the exception of the songs 'Streets' and 'Warmness On The Soul'. 'Warmness On The Soul' is pretty much giving you a break from the screaming and anger. It's a piano ballad love song dedicated to M. Shadows's girlfriend Val (who is now his wife). The piano is played by The Rev, which is actually adapted from the Pinkly Smooth song 'Mezmer'. Synyster Gates only recorded one song in this album, the intro song 'To End The Rapture', which by listening you probably would have guessed. If you're an A7X fan, you should own this CD because this is their origin. Or if you just enjoy some good old screaming hardcore punk, you should at least give it a listen. I still enjoy listening to it.
0307341577|5.0|This is a masterpiece written in several compelling voices. Flynn's characters are deeply flawed and deeply wounded, but so human.  The central character, little LIbby Day, is a wonder of complexity. I felt great affection for her distinctly damaged self. The tangled plot kept me awake until the satisfying and poignant resolution.<br /><br />Ellen Kirschman
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I won't rehash the plot, and I agree with many of the reviewers: book five simply does not live up the excitement, grandeur or promise of the first three books. Honestly, I just plodded along till the end because I'd spent good money on this book. GRRM will have to really \\"breathe fire\\" into the promised two books in the series; I expect that most of his die hard fans will await and then read them, but I'm no longer excited.
B004LZF2LW|1.0|that's right, I am the first one star review, it is 12:33 where I am at and it says it is 3:33 in new York, stupid app, please update so it actually works! permissions?! what's next, you want permission to fornicate my grandma! when are these devs going to learn that they can't have sex with our elderly family members!?
B006BG7RI0|5.0|This 70th Anniversary edition of what i would call the best movie i have ever seen of the old Film Noir movies , Bogart in his wonderful role of the casino/club owner Richard Blaine ...Rick. The Cast is a wonderful group of actors and supporting actors of the time. The 70th anniversary edition contains the Blu-Ray of the film , with the dvd of the movie as well a nice little drink coaster set , a replica of one of the Casablanca movie posters and a wonderful book with info on the film , the sets and the actors.<br />If you buy this set i dont think a true collector and fan of the movie will regret it.<br />for my money , this is absolutely the best
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The Strokes are popular for having a garage rock sound emphasized on \\"Is This It\\" and \\"Room on Fire\\", but on First Impressions of Earth they decided to branch out quite a bit, and when you have songs ranging from Juicebox to Ask me Anything you can tell all the songs are pretty easy to distinguish from each other unlike their previous albums. With a song like Ize of the World it looks like the Strokes were ready to upgrade from garage rock to the arenas. Now lets go through each track shall we? (1-terrible, 2-mediocre, 3-great)<br /><br />You Only Live Once (3)- Great opening track, it's not too different from what the other albums had to offer and has an upbeat vibe to it, I can totally picture myself listening to it on a sunny beach.<br /><br />Juicebox (2) - The first single off the album, it sounds very different from what they've previously put out, it's not bad but it does get old.<br /><br />Heart in a Glass (3) - Another single with a killer guitar riff my friend said sounded like power rangers, eff him I like it.<br /><br />Razorblade (3) - Another good beach song, a bit unremarkable but I never skip it<br /><br />On the Other Side (2) - I'm not usually a fan of lyrics but I really like how detached they are in this one. The musicianship is ok.<br /><br />Vision of Division (3) - BEST. GUITAR. SOLO. EVER. It is short but very sweet, just listen to how lightning fast the spanish influenced solo is for yourself.<br /><br />Ask Me Anything (3) - Very weird song, very vacant lyrics which I think is kind of the point, the whole thing feels very robotic and futuristic, I picture THX-1138 to this song. It's a bit repetitive but it all has almost like an electronica vibe to it. I wouldn't mind seeing the Strokes dabble more in this direction.<br /><br />Electricityscape (2) - This song sounded kind of bland to me at first but it's whole skyscrapers at night vibe grew on me, still not a song I seek out though.<br /><br />Killing Lies (1) - Bland and forgettable<br /><br />Fear of Sleep (2) - Another one that grew on me, very catchy stuff<br /><br />15 Minutes (2) - Another strange song for the Strokes, this one is the longest on the album and it sounds like their take on prog rock, took me some time to let it grow on me but I don't think prog rock is a good fit for them.<br /><br />Ize of the World (3) - Besides the abrupt ending this is one of my favorites on the album, the guitarwork in this one is just breath-taking<br /><br />Evening Sun (3) - Despite some pretty dumb lyrics (\\"I love you more than being 17\\", spoken from a true midlife crisis) the whole sound is really nice, totally laid back song that seems perfect with a mimosa<br /><br />Red Light (3) - A great album closer, the drumming is phenominal and the whole song just has a great upbeat feel to it, again much like hanging out on a beach.<br /><br />So the whole album is pretty disjointed, incohesive and random, you can tell the Strokes took a big risk with this one and I'd say more often than not it's a success, it's a shame though that the majority of the critics wanted to hear Is This It version 3.0 instead of the Strokes experimenting with a new sound, which is a shame because it sounds like on their new album they regressed back to their garage rock sound. Oh well, hopefully they'll keep exploring new sounds sometime.><br />Fear of Sleep (2) - Another one that grew on me, very catchy stuff<br /><br />15 Minutes (2) - Another strange song for the Strokes, this one is the longest on the album and it sounds like their take on prog rock, took me some time to let it grow on me but I don't think prog rock is a good fit for them.<br /><br />Ize of the World (3) - Besides the abrupt ending this is one of my favorites on the album, the guitarwork in this one is just breath-taking<br /><br />Evening Sun (3) - Despite some pretty dumb lyrics (\\"I love you more than being 17\\", spoken from a true midlife crisis) the whole sound is really nice, totally laid back song that seems perfect with a mimosa<br /><br />Red Light (3) - A great album closer, the drumming is phenominal and the whole song just has a great upbeat feel to it, again much like hanging out on a beach.<br /><br />So the whole album is pretty disjointed, incohesive and random, you can tell the Strokes took a big risk with this one and I'd say more often than not it's a success, it's a shame though that the majority of the critics wanted to hear Is This It version 3.0 instead of the Strokes experimenting with a new sound, which is a shame because it sounds like on their new album they regressed back to their garage rock sound.

B004R739LE|5.0|This product is really perfect for travelers. It's really far way from those tipical \\"hey, i'm carrying a reflex\\" bags. It really seems like a normal backpack. And it's really comfortable to use, two well separated spaces with enough cushing to protect an SLR and at least 3 aditional lenses.<br /><br />About the construction, maybe you already know about lowepro. Really good quality, great backpack at all.
B006VC3LES|5.0|According to the dvdbeaver.com and blu-ray.com reviews, the aspect ratio for this Blu Ray release is 2.35:1 and the picture quality is very satisfying.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|fun app but only a little bit of levels. i was very dissapointed realy mad dont get it its a wast if money.<br />not worth $3.00.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Everyone did a great job on this, Natalie Portman's best preformance yet, the score was great, the visual contrast between black and white were present throughout the film, the whole jarring effect of the film made me feel like I was slowly going insane along with the main character. The projector died at the very end of the movie so maybe that was ruined a little for me but otherwise it is a very well made film that I'd recommend. But...<br /><br />God Damn Aronofsky, how many more people going through self-destruction do we have to see? I haven't seen the Fountain so I can't speak for that but Pi (and his only happy ending) shows someone driving himself crazy, Requiem for a Dream shows a group of people succumbing to drugs, and the Wrestler shows a burned out wrestler commit suicide. Now they're all great stories and all but is that all Darren can do? How about finding a new formula for once, one where a character isn't circling the drain for once? Just saying, I liked Black Swan a lot, but it feels like a retread of Aronofsky's previous works.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!!! Loved all 3 books!!! It mirrored my life; to the point it was scary at times... My husband is now on the 3rd book and loves it just as much as I do (trust me that says a lot). I laughed, and cried throughout these amazing books! I have reread all three, which I have never done with any other books! Hope to read more from this author!!!! Thank you, EL James for the wonderful books!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I just purchased this item for my friend in India, this is a nice cover, but bit on expensive side, and the delivery charges were around 11 USD, which make it more expensive.<br /><br />Purchase it if you get free delivery, else paying 41 USD for just a cover does not worth.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game.... don't listen to the bad reviews this game is awesome it is a challenge for some people I had trouble with it but my brow beat it easily so don't feel bad if you don't beat it easily
0061780308|5.0|What a great story...stimulating race car enthusiasts and dog lovers everywhere. At first I wasn't sure I could relate to such a wordy writing style but I quickly adjusted to such an articulate dog relating such an interesting and tender story. It made me appreciate my dogs more and look at them differently and appreciate their concern. I would highly recommend this to all dog lovers.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|A) If you've read Twilight, you've already read this book (with a few alterations I guess to stop people from claiming plagiarism). Although her name is Diana, I assure you--her real name is Bella. (And Matthew's real name is Edward).<br /><br />B) Lol @ Diana having every conceivable power a witch can have--even after we're told how 'rare' they all are. It's even more amazing how ridiculously they all come out. Overkill.<br /><br />C) Matthew must've run in some serious circles. No matter how a great a person, it makes no sense he would know every great person in every age. Overkill.<br /><br />D) I'm good w/a good witch or vampire story -- but then we had to add in greek (or roman) goddesses, time-travel and knights? Knights, Really? Overkill.<br /><br />E) There are so many rip-off scenes I can't believe it got published: From \\"(D) Please let me watch you hunt! (M) No, you mustn't, I am too dangerous then!\\".... to the \\"(D) I want us to be [ahem] together. (M) Not yet, we have plenty of time\\" to the (yawn) idea of a creature governing body (Volturi, anyone?) getting in the way of the mixed breeds love, and (duh!) the potential of the mixed-breeds offspring.<br /><br />F) Was there no editor here? Hundreds of pages of nothing... there were maybe 3 scenes that had action. The rest? Her sleeping in his arms, pining over their love, and them fiercely protecting each other (when? Why, during those THREE scenes of course!)<br /><br />G) And btw folks, after you've suffered through the boredom... guess what? There is no resolution! There are a million ways to leave a story ready for its sequel. Not resolving ANY story arcs should not be one of them.<br /><br />None. Nada. Zip.<br /><br />The sad thing is, I think she had a good start, and a overdone, but not-so-bad idea. Someone should've stopped the publishing until she a)cleaned it up and b)concluded the story.<br /><br />Waste of money. Waste of time.<br /><br />If I could rate it ZERO stars I would--just for the factthat everyone who paid money for this didn't even get an END.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|I loved this version and intensely disliked it at the same time.  Most of the cast was absolutely perfect and really brought their characters to life.  Michael Gambon was especially delightful as Mr. Woodhouse (\\"in case the dancers should do something remarkably foolish...like opening a window\\") - lovable, charming, and brilliantly deadpan. Blake Riston was similarly humorous as the fatuous Mr. Elton.<br /><br />Austen is tricky to adapt because of her strong narrative voice.  Extensive narration isn't an effective tool in film, so adaptations usually struggle with replicating her wonderful dry wit, but this one does it better than most. The minor characters manage to convey the jokes Austen made at their expense and let the audience in on the joke, not an easy task. Mr. Woodhouse's neuroses, Mr. Elton's vanity and foolishness, Harriet's paltry brain activity etc are portrayed in such a way that you get some of Austen's humor, if not her voice.  What is remarkable about this version of Emma is that it's populated by Austen's actual characters, not signifiers for those characters.  Most adaptations are a window onto the world of the book - you get a partial version of Mr. Knightley, or Mr. Bingley, or whoever, and the film relies on you, the reader/viewer to fill in the details from the book.  This Emma takes no such shortcut - it truly brings the book alive.  Well, the supporting characters.<br /><br />Where it falls completely short is in the title character herself.  I think the script, direction, and actress are equally to blame, but whatever it is, it's maddening.  Romola Garai is imitating another famous RG, Regina George, and starring in Emma: Mean Girls edition.  She's loud (what is with the shrieking?), shallow (Emma is supposed to be intelligent), has exaggerated bratty teenager mannerisms (\\"um, no\\"?!?! Are we in 1812 or 2012?), highlighting all of Emma's flaws (and adding some new ones) without suggesting any of her virtues.  As the series goes on it's increasingly difficult to know what Mr. Knightley sees in her other than her beauty (RG definitely looks the part, I just wish she would act it as well).  Austen would cringe watching RG screech, bounce, and 'um, no' her way through the film.<br /><br />But the rest of the cast is so wonderfully engaging that it makes 'Emma' hard to resist (just Emma herself. Or 'Emmar' as Garai pronounces it).  Read the book again, then sit back and enjoy watching Highbury come to life on film, and ignore the Mean Girl in the title role.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game. Try it out for yourself only perk is you have to sometimes buy money so you can buy energy or what ever else you want but it's an option. if you rest like actually leave the game be for a while lol which I'm pretty sure it would be hard you will restore your energy and everything else is pretty much coins, food and timber deductions to pay off things. enjoy!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I just wanted to post my two cents on this film. If you haven't seen this on FX, you need to at least rent it for the experience.<br /><br />Hats off to J.J. Abrams for this movie. Excellent cast and acting (Chris Pine, Zach Quinto, John Cho, Simon Pegg). Superb, and I mean SUPERB special effects that make you feel you are actually there.What a great script. Not one slow moment. And thank you Leonard Nimoy for gracing this movie with your role.<br /><br />You have all read the reviews, and by now know the actors and the plot. Young Kirk, young Spock, young Bones, blah blah....it's all about the beginnings.<br /><br />If you like excellent (NOT lousy Sci_Fy Channel crap) Sci-fi. you will love this movie. If you are into special effects that put you right smack dab in the middle of it, you will love this movie. If you are a Trek Fan (I watched everything `Star Trek' from the day the series first premiered on tv, plus Deep Space Nine, ST Next Gen, etc....) you will love this movie. It is THE BEST of the franchise, period. Even better than ST4(The Whale movie).
0439023521|4.0|Excellent, Brutal, Adventure Packed more words could go into describing this but I will refrain.<br /><br />This book successfully held me from start to finish and I thoroughly enjoyed it, The lead Character, the trials she had to overcome kept his fast paced read exciting from start to finish.<br /><br />In a simple totalitarian world world the only way to survive is bend the odd rule and hope not to get caught doing it. However when the world asks each district to send in their children to fight to the death they have no other option but to do it and play by the rules.<br /><br />Or do they?

1569765677|5.0|The Sixteenth Round was written by a man that put everything he had of himself into this book. From the beginning it rings as true and honest introspection and very quickly the reader identifies with Rubin. The writing shows a total dedication; I could imagine the author sitting in the cell carefully planning every word and phrase like a sculptor might if they were creating the most important work of their life. While others may have simply wallowed in the misery of their situation, Rubin strived for something more out of life, a true champion that refused to quit even after the most devastating knockdowns. Inspiring.
0439023491|4.0|When you think how brutal the first book, The Hunger Games, was you wouldn't have thought that Suzanne Collins could have thought up yet more nasty ways that she could potentially kill off her characters, but she does.<br /><br />The story continues in it's fast paced, action packed ways and brings to light a deeper story to keep you gripped.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Right off the bat the tension and intensity of the show is higher. Coming off of last seasons finale it's almost as if things haven't settled down at all. The war is heating up, the characters are falling deeper and deeper into the complex narrative, the story is getting darker and darker.<br /><br />The first episode earns 8 out of 10. I don't give it a better score because it was scattered, but to be quite honest this was the best that could be done in this case, with so many plot threads to breath life back into.  Wonderful job, and it only promises to get better as the story moves forward.<br /><br />I will try and update with every new episode aired. There will be no spoilers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book, loved it so much I could not wait to read #2 just as I finished #1. I loved the characters, loved the mysterious of Christian and the innocence yet strong willed Ana. One of my favorite books I would have to say.
B0049P1N3K|1.0|This was recommended by someone at Positive Changes Hypnosis. Now I cannot recommend either one. The Power is on one of those feel good books. Just think good things and good things will happen. Fits in well with the stuff Positive Changes is selling. Nether one works for most people as far as I can tell. Certainly doesn't work for me. They tell you it is not magic, but give you magical expectations. I call it Snake Oil. Buy some if you want to get rid of some extra money. They will be glad to take it from you, no money back, guaranteed.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I have tried this on my Kindle Fire. It works great and the bonus games are equally fun. Great for kids, but be sure to child lock it or they will see one really bad thing. But other than that, it's great to use logic to create eliments and eventually create modern day things.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Looks slick, comprehensive information, helps me remember which way the wind is blowing, and even has a sense of humor (like telling me it's a poor day for indoor activities when it's gorgeous outside). Love it!

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I don't normally buy CDs from Amazon, but I followed the link from NPR after hearing the review. I am a long-time Bruce Springsteen fan, but usually purchase<br />songs on an individual basis, though I do own Live at Asbury Park, Born in the USA, and a couple of the most recent albums. I find this collection of songs particularly<br />compelling both in the energy of the music, and the significance of the lyrics. I first saw Bruce in the early 70s and appreciate his maturation over the years. For any<br />adult, this is a consistently meaningful collection.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like playing this game. The fact that it was free made it even better. It has been fun playing it with my granddaughter.

B004LZF2LW|5.0|Great graphical user interface, better looking than stock app.  The world map that is included is pretty handy as well.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|*Major Spoilers* The only thing worse than \\"it was all just a dream\\" at the end of an interesting piece of sci-fi/fantasy is \\"they were all just dead.\\" I'm fine with the idea that not everything needs to be explained, but it was clear from the start of this season that the writers were winging it. It's one thing when the audience is kept guessing, but it's another thing entirely when the writers don't have a clue.<br /><br />Problems with the writing began to surface as early as Season 2, when the characters began to do stupid things for the sake of contract violations. Frankly, I don't care if Libby and Ana Lucia got drunk on Oahu and were kicked off the show. That was no reason to destroy Michael's character. Shooting Shannon was another plot contrivance. (OK, so she was annoying.) But, you see, good writers can come up with plots that are consistent with the characters they have developed. Killing them in silly ways (Mr. Eko getting zapped by the smoke monster was just plain dumb), is simple laziness. So is slap-dab casting - the former Press Secretary of the White House playing the \\"mother\\" of the mythical boy twins? Every time Allison Janney opened her mouth I felt like I was getting a briefing. (In very bad Latin, to boot.) And all those pudgy lackeys with guns looked like they'd just stepped off the set of Buffy (first season - that would be 10th grade). Now that I think of it, what was up with all those guns? A desert island that is chock full of firepower? By the middle of sixth season it was just one endless shoot-em-up, the stock in trade of TV writers who can't think of anything else to do. When in doubt, have a gunfight. Or raise the stakes. It's not just everyone on the island who will die if something (what exactly?) doesn't happen - everyone in the WHOLE WORLD will die! (How exactly? Black smoke? That stuff couldn't even get rid of six marines.)<br /><br />But, in spite of all the lazy writing, I stuck with it, right until the bitter end. Why? Because when Jacob said he would explain everything, I believed him, even though he was, like Hurley said, \\"worse than Yoda.\\" (And I thought nothing worse than Yoda could be.) But there we were, after five years of toughing it out on this island, battling dark inscrutable forces, making fire with sticks, pushing out babies, and all we get is Christian ideology - CHURCH for godssake. (And not even good Christian ideology, because according to the last scene, Kate, Sawyer, Frank, Richard, Claire and Miles flew OFF the island. Which means they weren't even remotely dead. Nor were Rose, Bernard, Hurley, Ben or Desmond.) The only way you could possibly rectify that awful ending was by having them all be dead from the start of the series, which, very clearly, was not in the minds of the writers. The only thing that was clear at the end of this series was that nothing was in their minds - except maybe, \\"Hey, guys. I gotta get to Van Nys in an hour, so why don't we just, like, you know, ditch it?\\"<br /><br />And that's exactly what they did. The problem is that they ditched us, too.e when Jacob said he would explain everything, I believed him, even though he was, like Hurley said, \\"worse than Yoda.\\" (And I thought nothing worse than Yoda could be.)

B005CA4SJW|5.0|I got this set just a few days ago and watched all of it and, dispite someone's review that this set is edited and had cut out the part where Rick and the group pull a mangled walker into their departmant store and hack it up with an axe to cover themselves in the zombie goo to walk amongst the walkers to get to a construction company to escape, is actually THERE and NOT edited out. Just FYI. So, go ahead and buy it. Enjoy!  I did  :)

1579128149|5.0|I recently bought \\"The Elements\\" for my family.  Since we homeschool, I thought that this would be a welcome addition to \\"Science Class\\" as it gives very detailed information to the chemical makeup, atomic structure and information, melting/boiling points, etc as well as a wealth of important (and gee whiz) info about each element.  I had a similar book in my house growing up and besides it being a great resource, I found the beautiful pictures and information very interesting and it helped make Chemistry Class in school just a little bit less like \\"waving a magical wand\\".  I've never been good in Chemistry - as an engineer, I did just well enough to pass - but at least I understood the elements a little better.<br /><br />Theodore Gray's \\"The Elements\\" book, on the other hand, is hands down LIGHT YEARS better than that book I had growing up.  The pictures of the raw or processed pure elements as well as the minerals that contain portions of those elements are incredibly beautiful!  In addition, I loved the additions of common things that you might see around your house, in machinery, or commercially avaiable that utilize these individual elements (such as the small amount of Americium that is found in your household smoke detectors, Lead plates from your car battery, Thulium in metal halide lamps, and the radioactive Technetium that is used in medical bone-growth imaging).  I have to admit that I read through the entire book when it arrived in the mail and I loved every minute of it!  Guess I'm just a science geek...<br /><br />My only complaint is that the author didn't include the \\"year of discovery\\" in the scientific information that is shown for each element.  There is a plenty of black space that could have been used and this information is both informative in a general way as well as important for students who are doing reports or research.  However this is a MINOR issue and something that can easily be corrected by hand with an hour or so on the web.<br /><br />In summation, I absolutely loved this book and it would be a valuable addition to everyone's reference library - homeschool or not.r />In summation, I absolutely loved this book and it would be a valuable addition to everyone's reference library - homeschool or not.

B004V6X90W|2.0|Based on the reviews, many of them, my wife and I thought this would be a clever, funny piece with some good writing behind it. We are pretty normal people, not easily offended and enjoy just your regular types of movies-- star trek, you've got mail, transformers, the various kid movies that come out....<br /><br />This movie just went on and on. The funniest parts are in the previews. The movie gets about halfway through and then just doesn't go anywhere.... plot gets really predictable and just repeats and nothing new happens. They do push the homosexual relationships farther than what would probably stay in the theaters for any length of time, and for normal folks like me it was like, well, I was hoping for more plot.<br /><br />Carey does not play his normal stupid-humor roles and this is certainly a different piece for him. McGregor is just a supporting actor and really doesn't have an opportunity to offer his true talent. He's just playing a roll in a film.<br /><br />Had I known, I'd have rather spent the time watching AFV.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great story, didn't want to put the book down. Can't wait to see the movie to compare. Highly recommend. I was a Twilight fan, but can say The Hunger Games is definitely better. May not be suitable for younger readers.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie is so FUNNY. I saw it at our theater & knew I would buy it when it came out on DVD.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Grisly Manor was fun to play. Really liked the graphics and engaging storyline as opposed to a series of hidden object screens. We're looking forward to more games from this outfit. Good job.

B00571F26Y|4.0|There seems to be a lot of research on the subject in the book.  I find it a little amazing that wheat could be the culprit for so many ailments and no government agency AND most doctors are looking the other way!  This looks like a common problem with our way of life.  We are a country of consumers and capitalism plays right into our way of life.  Anything for a buck, even if it means your life!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a very well written book and certainly kept me interested to the very end. I can always tell from the very beginning whether I will like a book or not and this book grabbed my interest right away.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very Fun! Had no problems at all! And the best part is that it is FREE!! I will recomend it to my friends!
B007BLCGNU|5.0|This movie really exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be good, but it turned out to be great. The excellent cast and compelling storyline kept me captivated for the entire length of the movie. It is truly a shame J. Edgar was Oscar-snubbed, DiCaprio and Hammer deserved at least nominations for their roles in this film.<br /><br />Likely my favorite Clint Eastwood film to date and a soon to be part of my DVD collection.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|My Week with Marilyn features Academy Award nominated performances from Michelle Williams as Marilyn Monroe and Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier.  The film is culled from the diaries of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) who worked as a third assistant director on the film The Prince & The Showgirl which is depicted in the movie. In the film, Ms. Monroe develops a trust and shares what may or may not have been an intimate relationship with Mr. Clark.  Ms. Williams may seem like an odd choice to play Marilyn since she really doesn't bear much resemblance to her other than having blonde hair, she does an amazing job capturing her spirit.  She has the whispery voice and the playful ing&eacute;nue aspects of Ms. Monroe's personality down pat.  She also has the self-doubting, insecure persona that made Ms. Monroe such an enigma down as well.  Mr. Branagh is a commanding presence as Sir Laurence as he struggles to understand the method acting that Ms. Monroe is employing in finding her character.  Judi Dench plays actress Sybil Thorndike who becomes a buffer for and a champion of Ms. Monroe, Emma Watson has a small part as Lucy a wardrobe assistant with whom Colin takes out on a couple of dates and Julie Ormond plays Vivian Leigh, Sir Laurence's wife at the time.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|After a thrilling ride with the first 2 books, this finally to the trilogy dropped me like a hot potato.<br /><br />My 11-year-old son roped me into taking him to watch the movie, which I very much enjoyed so I ended up reading the books. The first book was good, the second book was such a thrill ride and I couldn't wait to read the 3rd book.<br /><br />But then wham! Mockingjay was just too gritty for my taste. The violence, Katniss' emptiness, Peeta's torture, it was just too much. And the ending was too abrupt. The 2 books built on Katniss' and Peeta's 'relationship', then it just ends like that, no build-up, just fast-forward.<br /><br />I felt thoroughly depressed after reading Mockingjay. I wanted a better ending for them, better closure. I understand that torture and war changes people, but sometimes finding love and slowly letting go can help heal wounds, though not completely, of course, and this was what I was looking for but didn't find. Found a handful of fan fiction that satisfied me a bit, thank goodness for other folks' imaginations. I still want to watch the next movies in the series but dread the final one - I hope they re-write & give it a better ending as I really don't want to spend money to get depressed.

B004SYP5WC|5.0|Works wonderfully! We haven't missed a bill yet since we started using this app. I love that it reminds me five days ahead. It us very convenient!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I recently finished this book and am midway thru the second.  I don't usually read this type of book, choosing safe reads such as Nicholas Sparks (meaning that I know it will be a good read with no buyer's remorse).  However I was in the mood one day for something a little different and so I gave this a shot. (I was looking for something of a series).<br />This book was intoxicating.  Yes very explicit, this is exciting.  But more was the plot.  I literally could not put this book down.  Yes we hear that often but this truly was the case.  I found myself anxious thru the day so I could get home to pick up where I was forced to leave off the night before.  I could not wait to find out what all the fuss was about and what secrets were waiting to be told!  The characters, their personalities and stories take you places that the majority of us probably have not been. Plus I was really able to relate to the authors writing style.  In many ways she puts into word the way that women my age and in my area would actually speak, react and think - with the following exception...<br /><br />If I am forced to make a negative notice it would be that the book often and I mean OFTEN, uses words and terms that the average everyday person would not.  I found this book to be a bit wordy in that respect.  Plus it has several typos.  We see typos in books all the time but this book as well as the second in the series had more than its fair share. I find myself puzzled at times with references being made that (thankfully Kindle has a dictionary feature) I would be forced to look up and mull over trying to decide just what the author was trying to say with a particular statement or word.  This was distracting.<br /><br />With that being said, at the completion of book one I found myself anxious to get reading on the second.  This could shape up to be one of those reads that you wish didn't come to an end.<br /><br />Midway now thru the second book in this series I am still enjoying the book very much though I am finding that much of the story telling is the same throughout both books.  If you're not careful you could let yourself get bored with the sexual tales.<br /><br />If you can get past the grammar and spelling errors then this book is a great escape!  I would recommend this series and have in fact.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|This film was visually stunning.  My weak vocabulary and lack of scientific understanding of graphic design prevents me from saying more than that.  And the film has its share of mood, intrigue/suspense and of course sex & violence.  It's a very explosive movie (figuratively and literally).  The only problem I have is its almost like 3 different movies.  The \\"girl\\" (with the dragon tattoo) is cooperating with a journalist to solve a 40 year old mystery surrounding a missing person at the behest of a kind wealthy man.  This comes after said journalist comes under fire for niavely(sp???) reporting a story that has little to no truth based on a rumor he overheard.  This sounds like a fairly decent story and it is, like I said it's very entertaining.  But then the mystery is solved and we go back to the journalist's woes & how he attempts to get even with some guy who set him up to report a story that he should have known better to report...that goes on for about half an hour and it's not clear why the script focused on that so heavily.  As for the 3rd \\"story\\", I guess it was a form of character development but, to put it vaguely as to not spoil anything, it deals with gov't corruption and how the GWDT, who is the victim of this corruption, gets rid of the problem.  Perhaps you could classify this as \\"pulp\\", but it's very well done.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|\\"Game of Thrones\\" from the book series \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" by George R.R. Martin is one of the best adaptations done for screen big or small.  The Blu-Ray really brings out the cinematic quality of the show along with the sound.  If you watched the series on HBO, even in High-Def, I'd still recommend the Blu-Ray.
B0073PZIYI|1.0|While Timberlake and Sigfried give intense performances, the overall theme of the movie is tired.  In a world where time is not as precious, this is not a total waste, but it is not the best movie I've seen.
1582406723|5.0|Sometimes, I want a story to stay true to the original material.  Reading Kick-Ass, and then seeing the movie, I was disappointed by every change the filmmaker made.  He took a deep, dark, and unique comic, and turned it into a semi-generic superhero story.<br /><br />However, as someone who first watched seasons 1 & 2 of the AMC TV series, and then read the first 3 volumes of The Walking Dead, I can say, I love both series equally. The comic is different form the show.  Very different.  Different characters, timelines, and scenarios happen.  There are characters and incidents that happen in both, but often in a different context, or with different characters altogether.<br /><br />For me, this has made reading the comics a true joy, as the show doesn't spoil the book, and vice-versa.<br /><br />Art in this book is great, it's obvious they have fun drawing out the zombie battles, but it's the writing that stands out.  Making these survivor characters into fleshed out personalities, and showing how people break down at the end of the world, is heart-wrenching, inspiring, and terrifying, all at once.<br /><br />A great read.
0553801473|2.0|After reading 'A Dance With Dragons,' I am officially giving up on this series. I am convinced that GRRM has no idea where this story is going, and to deflect from this fact, he simply ignores his established characters (or kills them off for no good reason I can see) and brings in several new, much less interesting characters. I feel like I'm being jerked around, which was kind of a novel concept at first. However, it's gotten old. Write the story you started, Mr. Martin; that's the one I signed on for.

1451648537|2.0|This book has refueled the debate about jerks in management.  In this month's Harvard Business Review, Isaacson defends Jobs as \\"great man,\\" and rejects those who take his biography as grounds for concluding otherwise. Well I'm one of those who has concluded otherwise. I understand that Jobs had a unique leadership style, but people still deserve to be respected as humans.  But the author forgets that important fact. This recent post from Dan Mulhern says it best: \\"high standards - even perfectionism - are not inconsistent with respecting people as people.\\" Here's Mulhern's full article -- it makes some great points that I think Isaacson could learn from.

B004WY2M8I|1.0|I am amazed at the amount of good reviews this book received.  I have read alot of books and this one is by far the worst.  Why must every situation be examined over and over again from every angle possible.  I found myself saying alright already on with the next thought.  This is the first time I actually didn't finish a book.  I will read something else and then try to go back to it but after a page I am sick of it all over again.  I won't even read another of Anne Rice's books because this one was a waste of money.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I'll start off this review by saying I've never tried using a headset with my xBox until now. It's quite a difference.<br /><br />I use the x41's for a plethora of activities:<br />-MW3 and BFBC2 on the xBox<br />-PC Gaming (WOW, Dirt 3, Skyrim)<br />-Multimedia (music and Blu-Ray)<br /><br />I can honestly say this is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I'm a musician, so sound quality is a big deal to me - I can easily distinguish the difference between quality recordings and non-quality ones.<br /><br />Playing xBox is a completely different experience with the x41's. Since I got the headset, my K/D ratio went from a decent 1.6 to a more impressive 1.9 in MW3, and the game became a lot more fun in general. You'll hear sounds you never even knew were a part of the game as soon as you plug them in. The 7.1ch surround sound really makes a difference in whether you'll get that split-second kill by hearing a guy come up from behind you. Same goes for BFBC2 - amazing.<br /><br />Skyrim, being rather heavy in terms of in-game dialogue, sounds absolutely fantastic with these headphones on my PC using the digital output.<br /><br />Music, streamed from my PC, also sounds great. Although it's true you get a little bit of background static with this headset because it's wireless, you get used to it pretty quickly, and the sound quality you'll get completely makes up for it.<br /><br />I have no regrets about purchasing this item - go ahead and buy one if you're in the market for a new headset!

0786955570|4.0|My boys (10 and 8) had expressed an interest in playing a traditional pen & paper RPG campaign for a while. They love fantasy world in movies, books and video games, and thought D&D would be cool. I also thought the imagination stretching and basic math required would be a great way to stretch their minds while having fun. Unfortunately, their attention spans didn't survive our first few attempts. One day I ran across Castle Ravenloft in a hobby shop one day and decided to give it a try. It reminded me a bit of HeroQuest, a board game I loved as a kid. With pre-made characters and adventures, it looked like a hybrid between the more fully featured D&D quests they wanted to try and the board games they already love. Best $60 dollars I've spend on a family activity.<br /><br />My boys love the randomness of the adventures, the combat system, and the content (what boys don't love vampires, zombies and dragons?). I love that it's cooperative, instead of competitive; so we can use teamwork and build strategies to win. I also like that they left just enough math in there to help keep their brains from being atrophied. For example, if my oldest is using the fighter character with an AC of 17  and he's fighting someone with an attack of +8, he knows he wants to roll an 8 or lower for the monster's attack. And finally, I love that the players must control the monsters too, instead of a DM controlling them. It helps add to the sense of it being \\"us against the monsters\\" instead of \\"us against the DM\\". My only real complaint is that it can sometimes take a while to set up for a particular adventure.<br /><br />P.S. My adult friends enjoy playing too!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Picked this up on a friend's recommendation and couldn't put it down.  Mr. Howey's wonderful imagery and unique, soulful characters combine to paint a very detailed picture of silo life.  Heroes and villains alike are portrayed in a very human light as both see their causes as just or at least necessary.<br /><br />Book 1 grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the 5th is over.  I can't wait to see more from this series, especially those hinted at after book 5's epilogue.<br /><br />Buy these books.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Mr. Howey, please write more of these wonderful stories!

I don't understand one word of it!\\" But then my friend told me it would get better and I trusted her.<br /><br />The next day, I picked up the book and read 60 more pages- I couldn't stop reading! If you buy this book and stop reading it, just pick the book back up and keep reading! It really does get less confusing, and every chapter makes you want to read more. I am now on the third book in the trilogy, and I regret I have read the series so fast!!<br /><br />Trust me, this is DEFIANTLY worth your money. The author's writing was so well written that I actually felt like I was with the characters.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good, thrilling book that is full of action and awesomeness- with a little bit of romance- this is the book for you!!<br /><br />One last thing. I have a word of advice- DON'T READ THIS SERIES TOO FAST, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great storyline - really intriguing characters. I couldn't put it down... I'm not sure whether it was because I read through all 3 in a weekend, but I found myself skipping a lot of the sexual scenes... just because they were slightly boring to me compared to the relationship development between the two main characters and the history behind Christian's childhood. Highly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is awesome! A must read!! It keeps you captivated, I read the first book in one day because I couldn't put it down. Some parts are a little gory or sad but its all in good taste. Love this author, I'd also recommend The Geggor series by her!<br /><br />Read this on my phones kindle app, works great!
B006VA57CY|5.0|I'll join the chorus...DON'T MISS THIS ONE.  It is absolutely first rate production.  Maggie Smith steals the show.  She gets the best lines.  The story will move you and make you laugh.  The Blu Ray DVD is worth getting if for no other reason that the lines are easier to understand.  Sometimes, in the television version, the actors lines seemed to be swallowed, and were hard to understand through the English accent. But on the Blu Ray the words are much clearer.  Don't know why that would be the case, but it is.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I must preface this review by saying I've been a fan of Madonna's since the first time I heard Holiday in the fall of 1983, but that in no way means I love everything she's done in the last (almost) 30 years and, unlike many other fans of my generation, do not automatically give her music 5-star stellar reviews. Now that that's out of the way, I can't express how pleased I am with her return to form with MDNA. Despite how much I looked forward to the release of this record--four years is a long wait between new Madonna music, despite the bones she threw us with the two new songs off of Celebration (loved Celebration, couldn't stand Revolver)-- I was *very* skeptical when Give Me All Your Luvin' was released. Mediocre and an obvious a tie-in to the Super Bowl performance, I feared the sound of the song was a prelude to what was to come on the album. Thankfully my fears were totally unfounded. As soon as I heard Girl Gone Wild, I breathed a sigh of relief. Even though initially it sounded a little too much like everything else that's out now in the same genre, I soon warmed to it and heard the Madonna sound I know & love shine through.<br />Every Madonna album has at least a few songs that are filler and just not that great, but when she gets it right, she really gets it right, and this happens so often on MDNA that the missteps can be forgiven. I think what I love most about the album is that it's very traditional in that it has a nice balance of uptempo songs and beautiful ballads. Falling Free ranks up there amongst her best of the latter category-melodic, beautifully sung, and lyrically rich. Masterpiece is a nice ballad too, but Falling Free blows it out of the water. I F'ed Up and Best Friend are ballads with a beat, and even though it's impossible not to interpret the messages of both as quasi-tributes to the Guy Ritchie marriage, they're still good. The uptempo standouts: Girl Gone Wild, I'm Addicted, I'm A Sinner, Love Spent, and Beautiful Killer. I've read in SO many reviews that Madonna isn't ahead of the curve musically anymore, that she's just making music that's already popular, yadda yadda yadda...okay, and so what? Not everything she does can be revolutionary, and that's fine. Most of us just want to hear the Madonna sound, even it's if couched within \\"popular\\" music and beats, and MDNA has very much of the Madonna sound--especially after listening to the album a few times this fact becomes really apparent. She has a way of putting her own spin on whatever she does, and it's almost impossible define the Madonna sound, but you know it when you hear it.<br />The only songs that are just plain bad are I Don't Give A and B-Song (why she chose to include either I have no idea, but at this point in her career it's certainly her prerogative to do so, just as it is the listener's to hit the skip button when these clunkers start). It still doesn't take away from a 5-star review because, as I stated, it wouldn't be a Madonna album without at least a couple \\"Huh?!?\\" songs, and the great ones make these missteps pretty easy to ignore.<br />There's no one who can touch Madonna-and no, I'm not comparing her to Gaga, or Britney, or Ke$ha, or any of the many others who wouldn't have a career if it weren't for her influence (and props to the ones who freely admit this fact). Madonna never invented the wheel musically, but she's certainly carved out her own style and a place for herself in the music world: the 300+ million albums sold, 12 #1 (US) singles, world's top-selling female recording artist ever, and litany of other achievements more than attest to this fact. Very few artists in any medium are still relevant--not to mention undeniable popular icons--more than 30 years after coming onto the scene. Of course the haters will say she's not relevant, too old, this, that & the other: I've heard it all before (to inadvertently quote Sorry) and it's irrelevant. She's back and not going anywhere. No one's forcing people who don't want to listen to her music to do so. Luckily for those of us who do, we have a welcome return to form in MDNA and this makes me very happy.ant to listen to her music to do so. Luckily for those of us who do, we have a welcome return to form in MDNA and this makes me very happy.
B0076D20E8|1.0|This movie looked like it would be interesting.  But it was too disjointed for my taste.  You think you're going to watch a period piece, and it starts with modern skyscrapers and cars...What?  Then it takes you back to Shakespeare times.  Then 5 years earlier, then 40 years earlier...By this time, I'm lost as to what is happening.  Then it moves forward...are we 5 years earlier or some other space in time.  Maybe if you can hold out to the end it improves.  But about this time, I turned it off.  I  figure you have 30 minutes to let me know if you are a good enough movie to keep watching.  But after that...I'll go watch Downton Abbey reruns.

0143118757|5.0|This book was required for my negotiations class. I am glad I've read it.<br /><br />The author espouses win-win negotiation tactics. After all, not only is win-lose strategies mostly ineffective, but they tend to have adverse affect on the relationship between the negotiators.<br /><br />The author specifically decries position (hard nosed) based negotiation tactics. Instead, he espouses tactics that focuses on the common interest of the parties to achieve a favorable outcome without ruining relationships. In fact win-win style of negotion tactics can build trust and even enhance future relationships.<br /><br />Negotiation is not just about objectives, but it is also about people. Just as anything involving people, emotions, perceptions, values, egos, mind-sets all come into play. Understanding of people and human psychology and the ability to see and feel an another person's persective (empathy) is crucial to a negotiator.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for those who wants to understand the improve their negotiation style. If you are only interested in hard-nose negotiation tactics in a zero sum game, then you may want to look elsewhere.

B0020TS5LU|4.0|Delightfully odd is what I call Gosford Park.  Without getting as picky as many other reviews floating around, I'd say this cross of an Agatha Christie Ms. Marple mixed with Howard's End.  Even then, I'm making it seem quite dark - which it isn't.  This is the most entertaining ensemble piece I've seen in a very long time and Altman has an effortless touch with so many legendary actors crammed into an old house around a dead body.<br /><br />In a sense, there's almost too much going on for the film's own good.  In the last third, some characters drift in and out of the narrative simply because the plot gets in the way which is a disappointment compared to the first chunk of the film.  Before the body turns up, it's less a forced setup for suspects than a supreme exercise in just hanging out.  Howard Hawks made a western in the same style with John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan and Ricky Nelson called Rio Bravo.  There too do we get caught up in the daily musings and sing song of some old friends locked in a jail house.  There too does the film lose steam when the story gets in the way.  But here, one must congratulate Altman for corralling so much talent and funneling it into something genuinely entertaining and, at times, even absorbing.<br /><br />Gosford Park is a victim of its quality.  There's so much to see and so much to tell, when he gets around to making a movie out of it, it's just not as interesting as what came before.  Even so, there's few other movies I've seen in the last 20 years that offer so much for your time.

B007P3TMW2|5.0|To say that this film touched my soul would be an accurate description at least. I would imagine that everyone everywhere has lost at least once in their life profoundly and know that the depth of such a loss is EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE. We all lost someone on that \\"the worst day\\", that September 11 madness day. We ALL lost fellow American's. And not just at the World Trade Center, which so often in my humble opinion seems to get lost as lost can be when we don't say what happened at the Pentagon and in a field in the middle of nowhere. Just because my Mother died August 5, 1992 with no notice and with a swiftness that takes my breath away even now instead of September 11, 2001 doesn't make it any less EXTREMELY LOUD nor INCREDIBLY CLOSE....it's painful and it hurts and it's angry and it's sad and it's searching and it's finding and it's all the things that we wish we didn't have to go through to make us who we are. This child seemed highly inappropriate the way he treated his mother and everyone in his path, but really? Was he inappropriate? When you experience profound loss, what is appropriate? I've read several reviews deeming this movie as not enough of this and too much of that...isn't that how life is? I personally found a kindred heart in the amazing acting of a boy who did such a good job at his job that people have seriously scolded his actions! That is irony personified.

0062082353|3.0|I was USN/USMC First Marine Division, I-Corps, Vietnam, 1967-68 including Hue City, Quang Tri and more. While this book is no literary masterpiece it does give one an idea of the not so glamorous reality of a war zone...at least from what I can imagine having been in another war.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with all these gung-ho writers is that you can only be a real patriot by being a real warrior and following the politicians in these self-destructive wars like the minions in that famous Apple commercial. Nothing can be farther from the truth. I was a patriot and a real American by going to Vietnam and I was a patriot and real American by protesting that war when I returned, as were many of the protestors who helped get us out of that war.<br /><br />And the next question is how patriotic are these volunteers who have served and have boots on the ground knowledge of the senselessness of these wars but keep up the volunteering and killing  when there is really no hope of accomplishing anything? ...just asking. It's partially a morality question.
1451673442|5.0|I have read more than 20 books on Law of Attraction and this one is not a guide which will teach you anything about LOA. Most of LOA books will teach you to set your goals and then visualize it and soon it will become reality. We try to follow through and see results aren't showing and we get frustrated thinking that this is a Hokum. But this book will teach you how to implement LOA in your daily life without teaching about it. It contains 30 exercises one for each day. Every exercise is simple and doesnt require too much efforts on your side. I cannot guarantee that it will fulfill all your desires but It will make you really happy and thankful for whatever you have right now.<br /><br />I personally feel that if you can achieve feeling of gratitude on you present situation then later or sooner Prosperity, perfect health & relationship has to follow.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|I intentionally read the book \\"The Help\\" before watching the movie. I'm more of a reader than a movie watcher. I always like to read the books first because I have all the details and background of the movie. Some people say it ruins the movie, but to me it only enhances it. There were a few differences in the two, but this movie held it's own. I laughed, I cried, and I sat mesmerized through the entire movie. It did not seem to me like it lasted almost 2 1/2 hours. Definitely would recommend this movie.

B000002I4S|5.0|This was the first Coltrane album that I ever bought.  Up until that point, I had never even heard any of his music.  When I took it to the counter to pay for it, the 20-something guy behind the counter said \\"Oh, cool....Coltrane!\\"  I said that I had never heard any of his music before and the guy said, \\"Well, get ready to live!\\"  Pretty strong words for an album, I thought.  Well, it was pretty accurate.  I'd never heard anything like it.  It was strange and foreign to me, but somehow felt familiar.  It just felt like what I'd always imagined the perfect jazz album would be.  I'm a musician, but I still don't understand all of the music theory on this album.  You could make yourself crazy trying to figure it out.  I'd be amazed if this album had come out in 2012, but the fact that it was recorded in 1959 blows my mind.  I can't imagine what people thought back then!  This is probably the best album to start with, if you're new to Coltrane.  Truly legendary, and it's not hard to see why!
B004LZF2LW|5.0|I used to spend 45% of my time on the phone with overseas accounts and staff.  In addition I traveled overseas about once a month in busy years.  This app is ideal for those kinds of people that need to know the exact time in multiple countries to make calls or to set appointments to contact someone.<br /><br />With all the countries that we dealt with being in different time zones and switching to daylight savings times it was a hassle to keep all those time related details in your head.  On some trips I would be in a different country every day and literally fly around the world in a week.  This type of tool would have been ideal to have.<br /><br />I like how you can set an alarm and the controls are easy to use.  It also has nice graphics and I like how in the landscape mode you can have a map or a globe view.  These are some nice touches that dress up the app. You can even scroll through the map or spin the globe to view the daylight versus night areas.  One tab even lets you remove the globe and map and just fill the screen with clocks for every city you have set up.<br /><br /> Overall this is a pretty good app that can be handy for some people.  It does ask for a lot of permissions but so far nothing intrusive that I could detect.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Approximate location Network based<br />* Precise location GPS and Network based<br />* Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage<br />* Full network access<br />* Run at startup<br />* Controls vibration<br />* Set time zone<br /><br />The app contains no adware, malware or analytics programs.  It is safe to download. It does use GPS locations to know where you are located to properly set the clock automatically.<br /><br />The app installed 5.16MB into my device memory. I manually moved it to my SD card and it left 1.97MB in my device memory and moved 5.12MB to my SD card.

1451648537|5.0|This is a well-written, well-researched biography of a man who may have been one of the most insightful and consequential people of our generation while also being, to all appearances, an incredibly unpleasant individual.<br /><br />The writing is engaging, and it seems that Isaacson had access to everyone relevant to the Steve Jobs story. At the same time, Isaacson does a fairly good job of keeping himself from being sucked in to Jobs' \\"reality distortion field\\" - a technique that Jobs had of bending popular perception so that even people to whom he was quite unkind tended to view him as an \\"enlightened being\\" (a direct quote from his former girlfriend, whom he abandoned when she was pregnant with his child).<br /><br />Isaacson also captures, however, Jobs' genius for cutting to the heart of issues. A good biography can point out the human failings of a great figure in history while clarifying what made that person great, and I think this book does an excellent job on both counts. Reading \\"Steve Jobs\\" walks us through the development of the PC market, the MP3 market, the smartphone and tablet market - and illustrates the appeal of Apple products (even to someone like me, who is by-and-large no particularly enamored of Apple products).
1451683405|1.0|If you are like me, and must have an absolute answer to the mechanisms of life and all its mysteries, this little book fails to deliver (and I feel no one can find an absolute answer on consciousness, for the matter).<br /><br />For a neuroscientist, he only cites one measurable scientific study claiming to observe the brain making decisions before the person is aware, and lambastes various credible researchers with just this one study alone. It is Benjamin Libet's brain motor cortex study, in which participants were given a simple visual test of pinpointing which of two letters were visible on a screen. The researchers monitored their brain waves via EEG and fMRI, respectively. The results show the brain made decisions 7-10 seconds before the person was aware of it.<br /><br />Pretty straightforward, right? It shuts down any other argument on the origins of consciousness, yes? Not quite. First of all, it doesn't deny the existence of a separate agency, a soul, if you will; it's just another discovery of brain mechanisms at work. Second of all, a similar study was done, by Davide Rigoni. The subjects were given a \\"Libet task\\": pressing a button whenever and however many times they chose, while indicating on a screen the time they became aware of the intention to act. Only this time, the group was split into two, and read pre-narratives, one which said free will is an illusion, the other just mentioning consciousness, but not suggesting it is an illusion.<br /><br />The EEG findings indicate the brains of the control group, the one given the neutral narrative, had far more activity than the ones prepped with free will as an illusion. Their belief had a measurable impact on something Harris claims one cannot control. A separate agency within them decided free will is real, and their brains behaved accordingly. Or was the positive narrative just an environmental influence on soulless automatons? Depending on how you conduct the study, and how the data is perceived, onecan draw either conclusion. But I don't want to wait till the end of days to find the one answer; I'll just believe I have free will and enjoy myself!
B000002G87|4.0|Eric Clapton really doesn't have much of a voice. I have heard it recorded, shown on television and live at the Fillmore East when he performed there in the '70's with Delaney, Bonnie and friends often with Leon Russell as a guest artist. That was a good show - full of energy and solid blues-tinged Southern style rock and roll, although I must say that Bonnie's introduction to \\"That's what a Man is For\\" .....\\"This is a red light song, so turn on all the red lights...\\" got old the second time it around!<br />So the Derek and the Dominos album does suffer a bit from his voice. But even this cannot spoil \\"Layla\\" the reason why I bought this album. Is it the dynamic dueling guitars of Duane Allman and Clapton, the drums and above all that down to earth bluesy heartfelt piano solo at the end of the track while the guitars play like high arching shooting stars above the basic groundedness of the solo and it tears my heart out and sends tears down my cheeks.<br />Yes memories. But Layla is fresh today as it was when I first heard it. And Bell Bottom Blues is a great testament to the evocative power of clothing. Amazon, I thank you again.

About the only high point was the assassination near the end of the book, but that was too little too late to save this turkey.  The popularity of this series makes me fearful for the future.  Our schools have, indeed, been dumbed down.
0515142247|5.0|Die Trying by Lee Child is one of those dangerous books.  Once you read the first few pages you are locked in and the action never slows down for the reader's need of nourishment or sleep.  This is another in the Reacher series and though they are all outstanding works, this one is intensely riveting.  Some of the descriptions, especially of Reacher's joy, are so moving they will be locked into your subconscious forever.  If you like studying the author through the characters and situations he creates, you will be overjoyed with the exceptionally fine writing coupled with the relentless suspense.  A must read treat for any mystery suspense junkies.

B006671NPM|1.0|The 3d is very disapointing, it's a good movie,but the 3d never leaves the out side of the screen, and has many chances to have some 3d pop out effects,but they never come.
1400069289|5.0|I have read so many self-help books that sounded good, but did nothing to dislodge my bad habits.  This one has already changed my life for the better in just a few weeks.  It's crisply written and uses many illuminating examples from different walks of life. Even if you don't have anything you want to change, it's a fun read that helps you understand human behavior and the brain science behind it.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I uninstalled this. I have polaris which doesn't come with a manual so I was trying to find a document program that was a little easier to figure out. This one wasn't much better and I had to upgrade to the paid version to do what it was I needed to do. I uninstalled it.
030796664X|1.0|9.5 hrs of my life that I will never get back. found nothing useful in it at all, only told about how someone else changed their life with no hint of how to help me. life in not static however books are so this one offered no help at all,,,boring, scattered, CDs sometimes started in the middle, to many stories mixed together with no understandable joining. wrote for people who are already in the field of analization of habits and conduct. not for the average person...waist of my time and money.
B005FVFWOI|3.0|It's wonderful that the CD has been given a much better re-mix, and it's nice to have all the extras (not that most of them weren't in Tull fans' collections already in various formats), but let's be realistic about one huge point: this is probably the most overrated album in Jethro Tull's discography. The brilliant jazz-blues/improvisational hybrid of their first three albums and early singles is largely missing here (unsurprisingly: newcomer Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond on bass is no Glenn Cornick) in favor of a mix of some nice, but inconsequential acoustic numbers (\\"Wondering Aloud\\" is, well, wonderful, but \\"Cheap Day Return\\" and \\"Slipstream\\" barely qualify as songs, and \\"Mother Goose\\" is as silly as the title would suggest), and the bombastic arena-rock that would bring them fame and fortune, but at the cost of permanently abandoning the style they had been developing as a band: from here on in, it's the Ian Anderson show, with whatever supporting cast he has on hand to supplement himself and Martin Barre. The changes did come to fruition on the next effort, Thick as a Brick, which completed the renovation of the rhythm section with much more \\"prog\\" oriented drummer Barriemore Barlow, but this is largely a transitional album, and should be taken as such, not as the pinnacle of their achievements: everything that came before, and much of what came after, is simply better done.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This particular category is not one of my favorites but.....this book takes the cake!! It is an easy read and sucks you in in the first chapter. It is very alluring and very seductive. Curiosity really gets you in this type of book!! I have read all three within a couple of weeks and would like to see more! I wonder what the book would be like from his point of view (hmmm). I highly suggest you try this out if you are curious about the \\"other side.\\" I can only sum it up by saying \\"WOW!\\"

1577314808|5.0|I do not possess the correct vocabulary to describe this wonderful book. All the positive reviews are testimony to it. This is the best, most powerful, and most eye-opening book I have ever read, in all of my years.<br /><br />I have read thousands upon thousands of books; reading is and has been my primary default mode, stopping only long enough to take care of life essentials.<br /><br />So, when I say that this book is the Superlative Book, I mean exactly that. Superlative.
B006Z21ZGK|3.0|I just turned off the TV and I'm currently listening to this Blu-ray with HD Audio 5.1, and ALL IS GOOD once again. Gotta love Maiden. New stuff, classics, its all the same formulaic stuff. But as I've preached many times, when it comes to Iron Maiden, you either GET IT or you don't. I developed my guitar chops on early Maiden tunes, so I've been a fan since day one. I buy every new release, unheard and unseen, and pretty much hope for the best.<br />Unfortunately, as I stated in the title, I can't watch this Blu-ray! Way too frantic and UNEDITED. Split screen galore, and not the good kind, where it holds and you can watch several camera angles, your choice. No, when it split screens you get the split image (2, 3 or 4 different frames) for about half a second. Then its off to the next screen. Do we really need to see every angle, every moment? The job of a GOOD EDITOR is to DECIDE what to show and for how long. Direct our focus and then KEEP it THERE for a few breaths at least. During guitar solos, just one camera on the guitar player please. -is this not simple common sense for a rock/metal oriented recording?<br />I realize this is an issue with many concert Blu-rays. This is not the first BD with frantic and hyper-speed, music video type editing. But it may just be the WORST I've ever seen. So Beware!<br />So my tip, turn off the TV, crank up the volume. With Maiden, its about the music anyway which deserves 5 stars, the watch-ability factor get 1-star. Overall 3 stars.<br />(Final Note: any Iron Maiden fans who have never heard Bruce Dickinson's Chemical Wedding album, should buy it immediately. It's what an Iron Maiden effort COULD SOUND like with a little musical/metal evolution, and hands-down RIVALS any Iron Maiden album in the last decade. Give it a spin.)
B006OFN0SE|4.0|A well acted movie about a particulary nasty man.  I thought it jumped around a bit too much, in terms of time sequencing, so one had to concentrate quite hard.  The clothes and makeup helped a lot in defining these issues.  Naturally, there was a preponderance of scenes around famous victims, JFK and Dr King in particular.<br /><br />Hoover was a racist, sexist and deceitful person, but he was obviously quite good at his job and established many new directions for the FBI such as fingerprinting and forensics. I thought too little was included about these advances, instead concentrating on the vicious and sensationalist aspects of Hoover's character, and a lot about his underlying repressed sexuality.  I thought the Clyde Tolson character was a bit weak.<br /><br />Leonardo di Caprio is, for me,  forever defined as the guy from \\"Titanic\\", young and eager to enjoy life.  Hard to think of him as the exact opposite as J. Edgar Hoover, but he did a good job, rather like his character.<br /><br />**** - 4 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Tim S

0307593312|3.0|I'm neither a lover or a hater of Murakami - I have enjoyed a few of his other books in the past but am not an avid fan.  This one, however, was just too long with not really enough substance.  I slogged my way through the entire novel but felt as if I had wasted two weeks of reading time.<br /><br />It is well written and all the parts mesh but it's like a huge cauldron of broth spiked with only a piece or two of vegetable.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am so surprised by the low rating for this book. I could not put it down once I started reading it. It's a complex story told from multiple view points and multiple families. It is a great piece of historical fiction before/during WW!, the Russian revolution and social changes during the period. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel.

0613021339|5.0|This story is a delightful twist on the original Three Little Pigs and my 8 year old (who just happens to be a huge wolf fan) was totally delighted with it and wants a copy for herself. (we had borrowed this from the library last night)  She got a real kick out the ending also.  She said she wasn't expecting it.  I wasn't going to review this, but she wanted me to, to let other grown ups know that maybe their eight year olds would like it as a gift.

B005UBNKWO|4.0|First off let me say that this is a great CPU. I did a ton of research before I bought this and It has paid off. My only problem with setup and install had to do with the fact that my mobo( biostar ta990fxe) I bought isnt very condusive for overclocking. When I tried to overclock the board and the cpu I had system restarts, which indicates the board reseting. I have gotten it stable just running regular factory settings and the speed is incredible. Even on factory settings I can run multiple programs at once without a hitch. I reccommend that if your going to purchase this chip, please make sure your mobo is compatible and dont take the cheap way out like I did on the board, buy a good solid board like ASUS or Gigabyte. Make sure its AM3+ socket compatible. Also, the stock cooler is ok but if your going to oc make sure you get a good aftermarket cooler, and with coolers make sure they fit in your case and on your board as I ran into problems with the cooler master hyper cooler not fitting on my cheap board.<br /><br />Overall- 4 out of 5 only because the stock cooler is shit and useless for overclocking and AMD knows its shit,<br />But the speed and performance is impressive and the price is terrific as well.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|I didn't think this app would be helpful to me until I read 80% of the reviews. I need the functions of this clock, as I, too, live in Hawaii and have several friends who travel around the world. Very valuable! Thanks again Amazon.<br /><br />I have noticed a pattern in the reviews. When an app is for intelligent people who contribute to society AND the app is well done, only people of compromised abilities (intellectual or otherwise) will denigrate the app. Logic appears to be absent in many gamers' comments. All games on your device are apps, BUT NOT ALL APPS ARE GAMES. Does this make sense? Lack of factual data seems prevalent. (Rio de Janeiro is 3000 miles SOUTH. Time zones only change East/West.) There is no need to put fake reviews because the value of that one-star is meaningless.

1439102813|4.0|I read Still Alice for our book club.  It was a very good but sad read.  It held my interest from the first page of the book.  Because the author is a nuero-scientist, she really seemed to capture what it would be like to develop early onset Alzheimer's.  This book brought me to tears and I would recommend it to most. It was not sappy nor overly sentimental.  Alice's journey was captured in this poignantly written book.  I felt her pain and the agony of her family's pain. I plan to purchasing her other books she has written.
0312641893|3.0|I loved this book until the last page.  Too much a cliff hanger for me.  What a pain. I don't want to \\"tune in next time\\" to hear the end of the story--if I knew I there would be no resolution at the end, I would not have started the novel in the first place.  Ugh.

B006P0FIB0|3.0|I RENTED THE MOVIE SO I DID NOT GET THE MAGIC OF 3D. I THINK IT WAS ENTERTAINING BUT NOT A GREAT MOVIE. I BELIEVE THE EARLIER VERSION FROM THE 90'S WITH KIEFER SUTHERLAND AND CHARLIE SHEEN, WAS MUCH BETTER.
0385341008|5.0|I finally got around to reading this book.  As it sucked me in, I felt as though it had been written just for me. It has all the things that appeal to me in literature.  It was enjoyable social commentary without ever feeling pompous or preachy.  I adored the quirky sense of humor, the respect for characters who make sacrifices and are not afraid to act in a way that is about more than their own needs, the complete lack of sentimentality in telling their stories, the spirit of optimism for humanity depicted throughout in the midst of so much horror.  I have been an anti-war activist for my entire adult life, and I appreciated the fact that there was no jingoistic explanation for the brutality.  Kit to me was a metaphor for hope--much like Miranda in The Tempest was centuries before.  Most of all I was moved by the profound love of literature and history that is woven into the fabric of this tale. 'Les Miserables' was written in Guernsey by Victor Hugo while in exile for supporting Republicanism and the revolution of 1848. I had recently referred to this in something I had written, so I personally felt as though the authors and I had shared a meal and spoken of that fact.  Their epistolary novel alludes to Hugo's sojourn and his writing on the island several times.  Included within is a beautifully realistic romance based on common interests (not money, status or a hunky body).  I delighted that the novel has these newly betrothed characters taking a walk in the shrubbery to speak of falling in love as in 'Pride and Prejudice.' With just a few words the reader was allowed to know these two will enjoy their marriage and give the delightful Kit a wonderful home.  I swooned when Dawsey and Juliet discussed Jonathon Swift, pigs and the trial in Nuremberg.  I am certain my husband and I have had a very similar discussion some time in our 40 plus years.  Oh and then, I must not forget the tantalizing mystery and excitement of finding letters from my beloved O. F. O'F. W. W.<br /><br />As I stretch my own wings as a writer, I now have a new goal.  To write one very brief sentence that prompts the reader to both laugh and cry simultaneously..<br /><br />As I stretch my own wings as a writer, I now have a new goal.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is AMAZING!!! I had just finished the much-hyped but disappointing Hunger Games when I found this, and with Prime you can rent it for free so I figured, why not? I am so glad that I did! Finally, we can relent the teenage angst and read a sci-fi/mystery for grown-ups!<br /><br />In this series, there's no girl filled with complicated, whishy-washy feelings that have little to nothing to do with the plot, the author isn't trying to make you cry, and NO LOVE TRIANGLE!!!  Instead what we find are people who are asking tough questions about their surroundings and their own existence, and are willing to die to find the answers. Eventually a love story does emerge, but it carries the maturity of an adult relationship.<br /><br />So, if you like Twilight and the Hunger Games, this probably won't be the book for you, but if you're craving a more mature story that has some substance, read this book.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|not that great if your looking for the first one then this isn't the flick for you but it does follow the originals story so if you like that you'll be happy.  But otherwise don't have a lot to say about it, it is an ok flick.
B003EYVXVE|5.0|This review may have spoilers for those who have not read the book. So I suggest not reading ahead if you've not read the book first.<br /><br />This might be a small thing, but I was looking in the video they showed at the Reaping from the Capitol for the mockingjay in the corner of the video. Now maybe the one they showed at the Reaping is a different video than the one discussed in the later books, but I was hoping they'd include that.<br /><br />Next, no cannons went off when Rue died or the other guy that Katniss shot in the same scene. I definitely missed that.<br /><br />Also, for someone who might not have read the books but went to see the movie, I don't think they would really understand how the relationship between Katniss and Peeta was played up as part of their strategy in the Games. It is true that even Katniss and Peeta don't know how much is real and how much was faked for the benefit of everyone watching the Games, but that just really wasn't portrayed clearly enough. I found myself forgetting while watching the movie and had to keep reminding myself. It would have been nice to see that Katniss had to earn the presents from Haymitch by doing just that--playing up their relationship. The one parachute with the message \\"you call that a kiss\\" isn't enough to drive home that point.<br /><br />They did a good job, in my opinion, showing the bakery scene. Specifically, showing it multiple times. But I don't know that the emotion and desperateness (if that's a word) that Katniss was feeling in that moment really came across. She was starving. She literally didn't think she was going to make it. Peeta throwing her that bread literally saved her life. And Katniss feels an obligation to Peeta because of that. She owes him. He saved her life. She has to return the favor.<br /><br />I will say that I really enjoyed seeing the behind the scenes stuff with the game maker and such. That was a nice added touch. And while alot of the stuff makes sense while reading the books--the way the people of the Capitol dress and such--really comes off as weird in the movie, but that's okay. And I guess, lastly, I'd like to add that my friend, Amanda, was very distraught that Buttercup was a black and white cat. Though that part didn't bother me at all. Overall, I was very impressed with the movie. Looking forward to the others in the future.the books--the way the people of the Capitol dress and such--really comes off as weird in the movie, but that's okay.

B0040MF1XK|5.0|This as a superb set, perhaps the best of the available complete cycles of Beethoven sonatas.  Lortie maintains a remarkably high standard of performance through the whole cycle.  He plays with great power and conviction, and without any eccentricities.  His articulation is very clear, for instance in Beethoven's \\"pizzicato\\" bass passages where the left hand plays short, detached notes while the upper \\"voices\\" have a long, sustained melody (Most pianists fudge these to some extent, but with Lortie they are consistently clear).  And Lortie always seems to know where he is going, building momentum and intensity over long passages.  The lesser-known sonatas receive fine performances here (No.4 is particularly joyous), and the greatest ones do as well.  The first movement of the Moonlight (taken slowly) has great atmosphere and intensity, and the Waldstein is resplendent.  Indeed, Lortie's Op.101 may be the best I've ever heard.  Even the Hammerklavier comes off very convincingly. The layout of the set is perfect, with all the sonatas except No.4 in numerical order, and the opus-number sets like Op.10 and Op.31 together on a CD, and the sound quality is excellent, resonant in the usual Chandos style but with great detail and impact.<br />That being said, no one pianist can hope to reveal every facet of these amazing masterworks, and good as Lortie's set is, no collector will want to be without the many, many great recordings of individual sonatas (Arrau's Pathetique, Rubinstein's Moonlight, Richter's Tempest, Gilels' Waldstein, Horowitz's Appassionata, etc., etc.).  Highly recommended!
B006X08EZY|5.0|David Byrne and Caetano Veloso both work in the upper register. They share a borderless sense of music, one minute in America, the next in Brazil. Pairing them in concert at Carnegie Hall --- a no-brainer.<br /><br />Veloso's songs start in the ether; there's no thrust, no urgency. He's in the transportation business; his songs don't come to you, you come to them. And when you arrive, you're wrapped in his thoughts and moods.<br /><br />Byrne's trickier. When he was the kingpin of Talking Heads, he wrote his share of off-kilter hits; he can, at will, get you dancing. But he's shy, maybe aloof, and diffident --- no one's more self-consciously cool than a New York art rocker.<br /><br />My wife and I saw the 2004 Veloso-Byrne concert from about the tenth row. It was magic, spectacular right from the from start --- I think pretty much everyone there got that, and felt privileged, and went nuts with pleasure and gratitude after each song.  A while back, we ran into Byrne at a gallery and asked about a CD. \\"Soon,\\" he said. \\"Maybe.\\" Well, what's eight years --- half as long as it takes for single malt to be drinkable.<br /><br />Veloso begins the show. If you're new to him, you might not immediately grasp that Brazilians rank him in the Bob Dylan zone. Then the sweetness and sensitivity seduce you. Byrne's presence comes almost as a shock. But not really, because there's no band here, just cello and percussion --- the Talking Heads songs you know and love do rock, just more intimately. Byrne and Veloso do some duets. Byrne sings in Portuguese. The words really don't matter; this evening was really about an exploration of sound. Namely, about how many different ways you can achieve gorgeousness.<br /><br />We live in the land of reality TV competitions; we can't help ourselves from asking who won. These guys are way beyond that. Serve this music with wine at dinner. And don't fail to savor it again, late in the evening; in the dark, it is the wine.
1439192812|5.0|Even if you haven't read any of Richard Dawkins's books, you can guess by their titles or by its reviews what he's all about. The Magic of Reality is Dawkins in a nutshell. You get evolutionary biology, the scientific method, chance and random events analysis, a little bit of molecular biology, some astronomy, earth evolution history (with earthquakes), and a mini \\"God Delusion\\". The book is written in an easy language and not condescending, although some reviewers complain about that. So far so good.<br /><br />Where the book really shines though, is in the illustrations. Davis McKean does a fantastic job not only in illustrating the text, but he actually enhances it. Evolution is illustrated with a bookshelf of ancestors' photographs and trees, the periodic table is brought to life with colors and also detailed electrons drawings, seasons and rainbows are explained with geometric diagrams. All the drawings are extremely well crafted and almost never redundant.<br /><br />So even if you don't care for Dawkins, or if you know everything that's in the book (I think most people will still find a couple of things they didn't know, or at least illuminating ways of explaining them), the illustrations are what really make the book a great and fun read. Skip the audiobook version.

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This classic title as all the value and more of a treasured coin once dusted of the grime and neglect of time. Compare today's instruction of youth has changed; how family influences have eroded; how moral ingights were formed to mature even at the ages of youth and the social network was face-to-face dialogue. We are left to wonder which is better and have to answer our own situations.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The book is somewhat disjointed, with some chapters seemingly unconnected to the main thesis. The opening chapters covering the habits of individuals are interesting, and include discussion of research in the field by MIT and Procter & Gamble. However, there is no practical advice offered until the ten-page Appendix (an afterthought?) titled \\"A reader's guide to using these ideas\\".<br /><br />Duhigg so broadly defines \\"habit\\" that he is able to define the widespread support for Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of a Montgomery bus as \\"the social habits of friendship\\" -- this is really a stretch. And the Starbucks company culture of customer service is painted with the same brush. Interesting stories but it's a simplification to discuss merely as \\"habit\\".<br /><br />The most powerful chapter is \\"How Target knows what you want before you do\\". This is necessary reading. Companies are using every tool at their disposal to analyze and predict customer behavior. None of them seem at all concerned at the invasion of privacy: massive purchase databases, video cameras, functional MRI. Who decides when a line is crossed? How is individual privacy guaranteed? When we read about the frequent breach of thousands of credit card records, and worse, shouldn't we be concerned about this next generation of \\"sharing\\"?
B000GCFY0I|3.0|The Publisher needs to make this book loanable on the kindle. One time loan for 14 days is not a lot.
1594203334|4.0|This is one of a genre of books that point out how people live better once they've moved away -- to a villa in Tuscany or to raising children in Paris. The flaw in most of these books is their narrow experience, usually among the upper middle class. Pamela Druckerman's book would be so much more cutting edge if she'd spent her time living in a gritty working-class town.<br /><br />And yet. There are some truly valuable insights to be found. The chapter \\"Doing Her Nights\\" alone is worth the price of the book. The French seem to have found a rational and humane way to get their babies to sleep through the night within the first few months. I wish I'd known this when my kids were small! Much of the book is commonsense advice on consistency, communication and setting limits for children. The French system of allowing new mothers 4 days in the hospital following childbirth certainly gives families a break, in contrast to American healthcare where \\"drive-through births\\" is the norm.<br /><br />I'd love to know what French parents think of some current fads among American parents: teaching reading at age 3, signing up children for so many classes that you need a calendar to keep them straight, and \\"attachment parenting\\". Also, the helicopter parents who become overly involved in their children's team sports.<br /><br />However, some customs in French schools seem problematic, even insensitive.<br />Pamela, once your children have completed the French high school system, please write a follow-up!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Holy Mother of a GREAT book, Fifty Shades of Grey is awesome!  For being on the top of Amazon's Romance Best Sellers list I thought it would be a good idea to give Fifty Shades of Grey a try and boy was I surprised!  It is kind of hard to put into my own words just how much I loved Fifty Shades of Grey.  E.L. James did a fantastic job creating likable characters with real life issues that are relatable.  I was a little skeptical through the first couple of chapters because honestly....the topics covered in this book were not very...widely talked about in polite conversation (to put it somewhat discreetly).  Once you get past those minute details it turns into one of the most relatable books I have ever had the chance to read.<br /> Anastasia Steele believes that she is just an average (almost) college graduate just living her life.  She is easily influenced to do things for her friends and typically has no problem with that until the latest request.  She is to interview one the richest men in the country who rarely gives interviews, Christian Grey.  She has no background information what so ever on him and knows nothing about him.  Going into this interview with little more than her meager confidence and a list of questions she is supposed to ask him, Ana is in for a major revelation.  She is about to meet the man that will change her life.<br />Visit us at Fairytales4grownups.com for the full review and everything Romance Novels like many more reviews and our blog.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|The famously shallow, permanent bachelor has developed feelings!<br /><br />I fully believed his character's complicated roller coaster of emotions surrounding his wife's betrayal and the difficulties of being a single parent. Somehow, Clooney even looked more like a normal person instead of the sexiest man alive. And he still maintained an understated sense of humor through it all. This was definitely Clooney's best performance.<br /><br />Two other performances I enjoyed in this movie were the skilled portrayal of the elder daughter by Shailene Woodley (who has really grown into acting since her days as a hot teenager on The O.C.) and Judy Greer (Fatty Magoo on It's Always Sunny) in a rare dramatic role as the wife of the other man.<br /><br />One criticism of the film: the environmentalism versus land development back story was extremely predictable and empty. The family drama would have been enough by itself. But at least this back story gave us an excuse to see some beautiful beaches!

0385341008|1.0|I liked it until I found out how Elizabeth died.  After the first part of the letter explaining the death of Elizabeth, I could not finish the book.  It was too much, too overwrought, too unbelievable, too boring.  From that point on, the book went downhill for me.  The writing was not as good.  It became a totally different book and lost it's charm.  After that, I just skimmed it to find out who Juliet ended up with.  Perhaps it would have been better if the original author could have been allowed to finish her book.  Not recommended, unfortunately.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Because I felt like I was there, going through all of the problems they were going through, and even felling how they felt! I would not recamed that someone under the age of 13 should read it thought, because it is very vilent. But all in all it was the best book I have ever read!

1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's book \\"Dying to Be Me\\", is an important read for anyone wanting to shift their mindset about their self worth and value.  Our own energy, thoughts, mindset, beliefs and values can have a profound impact on how we move forward in life and death.  It is a brilliant book and my husband is now reading it.  The account of her life growing up, cultural influences and values, her illness, near death experience (NDE) and healing are beautifully portrayed in a loving manner in this must read book.  I would rate this as one of the most important books in my life and one which I will cherish.<br /><br />Her strength to stand firm to matters that were important to her - finding the man who loved her for being simply and completely herself; for being proactive in her health; and ultimately for trusting the life/death process, is breathtaking.  Her story is one of tremendous courage which we can all benefit from... to learn how to view life and death in a healthy way, to erradicate our fears and regain health, wellness and magnificence!  Anita Moorjani is magnificent...and so am I!
B004HO6I4M|3.0|Rio is beautifully done. Each scene in the movie would be an excellent poster or painting! The whole movie is a pleasure to look at.<br /><br />The voices were done by a fabulous cast, but the acting overall was boring. I would have enjoyed the movie just as much if I had watched the entire thing on mute which was a huge disappointment. The script was disappointing and uninteresting. There was a lot of potential here and it came across as lack-luster.<br /><br />Each scene in itself was cute and quirky. As a whole or analyzed as a movie this was a disappointment. Wait for it to go to the $5 bin.
B002P7DIQ4|4.0|This episode was alot of fun.  You'll enjoy it more if you've seen a few other episodes so you understand the characters better.  I don't want to do spoilers, but there's a part with Penny and Howard that is Hilarious!! Go ahead and buy the whole season - it'll save you some money and you know you'll want to see them!
B00000J2SO|5.0|Rainbow is one of my top favorite bands for the consistent solid quality of their albums. Whatever they say about Ritchie, he definitely never slacked. A very solid, timeless album, another one of my favorites. Graham Bonnet's finest hour. That's why, when it comes to Rainbow, it's very easy to be biased.
1451627289|4.0|What a wild & crazy ride that attempts to answer all those lingering \\"what if's?\\"<br />Interesting premise, but I think the length could have been cut down some by excluding many of the details brought in during the \\"in-between\\" years.  The relationship aspect of the story, while integral, was never fully believable to me either.
B00000J2SR|5.0|I always loved this album. A better one out of the three Rainbow albums with Joe Lynn Turner. I can imagine how good would've been the follow-up if not for Deep Purple. It's sad, they were on the right track.
B0045DO8LA|3.0|RIOT ACT got some good songs like CAN'T KEEP, SAVE YOU, I AM MINE, GHOST and YOU ARE...but also got 3 or 4 songs that i don't care too much...In fact, for me this is the less inspired album recorded by PEARL JAM...Their previous albuns  TEN, VS., NO CODE, YIELD and even BINAURAL are way better...but if you like PEARL JAM, you may like RIOT ACT too...
B00000IMTF|5.0|Simply, the best rock/metal/whatever album I've ever heard!  In my opinion, even beats Heaven & Hell. Changed my life. Absolute perfection never surpassed by any one out there.
B000002JSR|3.0|Of course, this is LED ZEPPELIN and most of the songs on CODA are way way better than most anything in the world of music...but this is trully the last Led album to hear after all the other masterpieces...this is a compilation of nice songs, but only if you already love LED ZEPPELIN...
B00000IMTH|5.0|A great follow-up after \\"Rising\\"! Somewhat softer album comes very close to \\"Rising\\" qualitywise. Love every song except for a really boring flop \\"Rainbow Eyes\\".
B002IVLH60|4.0|BACKSPACER is a good album from PEARL JAM...Not a masterpiece like TEN or VS, but i think nobody really expect something like that again...Some good punk songs like GOT SOME, JOHNNY GUITAR, THE FIXER and GONNA SEE MY FRIEND, and some nice ballads like JUST BREATHE and AMONG THE WAVES...Really good...if you like PEARL JAM, you will like this one...
B007FH9GT2|3.0|One really must try hard to suspend disbelief with this film.  A mega-rich Swedish family with a tradition of serial murder and their very own basement torture chamber?  Really?  And a 23-year-old Goth druggie who has somehow learned a stunning array of investigative and banking skills that even the most seasoned cop wouldn't command?  Uh...no.  Basically, the story arc is ridiculous.<br /><br />But Daniel Craig does a fine job and Rooney Mara is riveting.  She takes one of the most unbelievable characters ever written and makes it her own.  And, by the way, hats off to Robin Wright, who has aged beautifully and doesn't, unlike Julia Roberts, desperately try to disguise it.<br /><br />I could have totally done without the anal rape scene, however.  Was there a point to that?
B000002JSN|5.0|PHYSICAL GRAFFITI got many great songs like THE ROVER, IN MY TIME OF DYING, CUSTARD PIE, TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT and the monster hit KASHMIR...the 2 disc trip sometimes is waaaaay too long, but thre´s not even 1 bad song is this pearl!MASTERPIECE! MASTERPIECE!

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is a wonderfully fresh young adult, sci-fi, fairy tale retelling. Is that a sentence you ever thought you would read? New author Marissa Meyer retells the classic tale of Cinderella using cyborgs and androids - and I was captivated every moment.<br /><br />Cinder is set far, far into the future in New Beijing, a part of the Eastern Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is one of the six countries on Earth now, after World War IV basically led to continents coming together as united countries. Somewhere along the line, people from Earth colonized the moon and have since evolved into more than regular Earthlings. The Lunar people, as they are called, are cruel and possess the power to bend other people's thoughts. Cinder is a cyborg, someone who used to be a regular human but was in a near-death accident, after which she underwent a surgery that combined metal parts and computers with her human body. She lives with a horrible stepmother and one just as horrible stepsister. Her other stepsister, Peony, is sweet and kind to Cinder (I loved Peony). Cinder's only friend is her android, Iko, whose unusual personality made me smile. One day, while manning her mechanic booth in town, she meets the prince of the Commonwealth, Prince Kai, and agrees to fix his old android that stopped working recently. Prince Kai is dealing with his own issues. His father, the Emperor, has come down with the plague that has been attacking Earthlings. And the sinister Lunar Queen is making life even harder.<br /><br />What really drew me into this story was Cinder herself. She is treated awfully, just as the original Cinderella. She's not annoying and she doesn't make stupid choices like some other young adult heroines. Cinder is smart, strong, caring, and sometimes funny. Her stepmother and stepsister treat her like a possession, not even allowing her to have the proper mechanical body parts. I felt so terrible for her and my heart strings were pulled many times throughout the story. I also really loved all of the interactions between Cinder and Prince Kai. There was no \\"I just met you but I love you\\". Cinder repeatedly refuses his attention since she doesn't think he will still be interested when he finds out she's a cyborg. I can tell that their budding romance is going to continue to build over the course of the four book series and that makes me very happy. I admit that I wasn't really shocked by any revelations during the story, but I found myself not really minding. I was enjoying the story so much that some of the predictable elements just made the story more fun! The way Meyer's story unfolds is surprising and exciting. During the last few chapters of the story I was practically holding my breath!<br /><br />With believable characters, a plot that somehow feels refreshing despite the fact that it's a retelling, and an ending that makes me WISH the next book was coming out anytime soon, I highly recommend Cinder!
B000002J1U|5.0|I love the first 2 LED ZEPPELIN albuns...Led III is on the absurd high quality level of them...This one got the monster hit IMMIGRANT SONG, FRIENDS, THAT´s THE WAY, TANGERINE, GALLOWS POLE and CELEBRATION DAY...GREAT GREAT COLLECTION OF HEAVY and FOLK ROCK SONGS!!!

B006VC3LES|2.0|Chinatown is one of the absolute best films of the 1970s, a neo-noir that is as dark and thrilling as they get. But according to the description, this edition is being released in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1. It was released in Panavision, which has a ratio of 2.40:1. This means that the sides of the image will be cropped out of the picture on both sides, reducing the image by about 25%. Sort of an anti-restoration.<br />I wouldn't recommend buying this edition until the aspect ratio is restored to its original size.
0439023513|2.0|This book is boring, meandering, and unpleasant.  I kept hoping Katniss was going to turn into the strong character she'd shown flashes of for the first book and occasionally in the second, but no... just more indecisiveness and stuff happening around her.  Reading a story about a character I don't care about doing things that she doesn't have any control over is just not very interesting.
B004G606K8|3.0|Although I can no longer remember their names, I thoroughly enjoyed the first few series written by these authors. Unfortunately this book is nothing special and I have no desire to get Volume 2. It contains the usual dungeons and dragons cast of characters. Yawn. Good to borrow for the plane ride or spending the day in your hotel room when your vacation is more rain than sun.
1444737090|5.0|I loved this book! It's a quick easy read but a page turner. This was a real heartwarming tale of two lost souls who found each other and formed an amazing bond. I hope there is a sequel so we can find out what life is like for James and Bob after the book. Best of luck to both of you!
0307592731|5.0|WILD is a fearlessly told, wildly fantastic, and entertaining story. The author, Cheryl Strayed (not her birth name, but one she chose after a her divorce) exceeded any and all expectations I had when Wild arrived in my mailbox. This is a memoir, but reads like a novel. All human behavior, interaction, and communication, I think, is best understood via the narrative, in other words--a story. And so I am going to talk about this story as if it were fiction - in the language of the six fundamental elements of a story.<br /><br />Title. Perfect. To look at the spine is to see 'Cheryl Strayed WILD'. Which would induce me to pluck it off any shelf. [However, I think the cover would have been better with a snapshot of Cheryl, or a trail maker of the PCT; but I understand the choice of the boot.] Cheryl Strayed is a wild girl, as she says: \\"I was an experimentalist ...  An artist. The kind of woman who said yes instead of no.\\" (p. 54)  That is a trail marker letting the reader know just what kind of journey you are about to get into.<br /><br />Plot. One of the best - Redemption of the human soul through the force of will, strength, and toughness. Briefly, Cheryl was born in 1968, white, female, attractive, intelligent, and in addition had the benefit of a college education. You could call her advantaged. But, big but, she was born into rural poverty and domestic violence and then her champion, advocate, and sole support - her mother - died suddenly of cancer when Cheryl was twenty-two. Cheryl, lost, descended into debauchery, seemingly bent on self- destruction via sex and drugs.<br /><br />Characterization. Not only did I quickly begin to root for Cheryl, I fell in love with her. She was/is the personification of my \\"perfect\\" woman. [I am aware, wistfully, that the person I am in love with is a fiction--a 26 year-old woman with the wisdom and wit of the same person 15 years later.] Not only was she white, young, attractive, intelligent, and funny; she was by her declaration: \\"--strong and responsible, clear-eyed and driven, ethical and good.\\" (p. 57) [And] \\"I was a big fat idiot and I didn't know what the hell I was doing ...\\" (p.58)  [Told you she was funny.] And it just keeps getting better, funnier; and yet in the next sentence she is as likely to bring tears to my eyes as to make me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Point of view. Her voice is perfect. I can hear her, see her! In all her joy and sadness and frustration, in other words, in all her humanity ... or femaleness. Cheryl blends the past with the present in the telling of her story masterfully. There is no confusion for the reader. Her wisdom and humor and reflection merge in ways that are really rare in writing.<br /><br />Setting. The Pacific Crest Trail, from the deserts of southern California, through the high Sierras and into the \\"Box of Rain\\" to the Bridge of the Gods on the Columbia River in Oregon, she describes it beautifully, as well as all the characters, camps, and towns along the trail. And most significantly for me--what it is like to hike alone, mile after mile after mile. [A thing I am very, very familiar with.]<br /><br />Theme. The power of the human spirit and the unequivocal interaction of the force of nature with that of man (woman) to combine to heal and restore a person to their true self.<br /><br />This is a rare book. I read a lot, and have never fallen for a writer and a voice and a story like I did for Cheryl Strayed and WILD.ion: \\"--strong and responsible, clear-eyed and driven, ethical and good.\\" (p. 57) [And] \\"I was a big fat idiot and I didn't know what the hell I was doing ...\\" (p.58)  [Told you she was funny.] And it just keeps getting better, funnier; and yet in the next sentence she is as likely to bring tears to my eyes as to make me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Point of view.

B006PGL7OQ|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie. It seemed like it had an interesting premise and perhaps some suspense.<br /><br />This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It dragged on forever! The payoff was literally 2 seconds at the end. Nothing else in the plot was resolved.<br /><br />The only saving grace in the movie was the acting. The performances were pretty good, they just didn't have a plot (or story) that moved.<br /><br />I was thinking of donating this to the library, but it would be cruel to inflict this on anyone else. I'll probably just throw it away.

B0000C03AH|1.0|This horrific offering is why SACD as a format is struggling. Instead of giving us more detail, they have smoothed everything over and given us symphonies so sweet sticky and gooey that they make your teeth hurt. Im sure that von Karajan would approve of what they have done (he seemed to love a homogeneous well blended sound), but it's killing me. I own this cycle on tape, vinyl, a version of the 9th on regular cd, and now this SACD version, and I'm telling you that they flushed all the detail down the toilet when they remastered it to this.<br /> I know that if they had just transferred what was on the masters and given it to us straight; the tape hiss would have been excessive (maybe even brutal), but at least we would have been able to hear the actual music as well.<br />If you like your Beethoven to be as smooth aged and mellow as the finest blended Scotch, then this box set is for you.<br />If you like your Beethoven to be raw real and ALIVE, then you need to invest in one of the cheap regular cd versions of this cylcle, or check out von Karajan's single malt 1950's Beethoven cycle (It's von Karajan conducting an Orchestra instead playing one like a virtuoso).<br /><br />Davis Hurd.
0316067938|4.0|This book was the only of the \\"saga\\" that I found it difficult to get through. It was overly detailed and just dragged on and on in multiple parts. The story itself was good and I truly enjoyed the closure once I was finished with it. The tying of all the characters was done fabulously, but as I said... something about it was just difficult to get through with this one. Still a good read though.

I had no issues with my Kindle version, and loaned it to a friend as well. She was messaging me the next morning to send her the next one. Yes, there is some violence, but that is not what the author focuses on. I don't think it's too much for teens, possibly too much for 10-13 year olds though. Overall, loved it!

B00005JSGK|5.0|Recently it appears several people have rated this movie a 1 star because they didn't look at the region code in the section and ordered a Region 2 DVD which apparently they probably wanted Region 1.  In my opinion Hatari deserves  at least a 4 star rating.

B00121QGUY|5.0|This is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like.  However if your boyfriend doesn't like these types of movies then put in the \\"unrated version.\\"  In the regular version the kissing/sex scene doesn't show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy.  It's definitely a cutesy movie, but the eye candy and bar scenes will keep the guys watching.  Piper Perabo and the rest of the girls won't disappoint I promise!

B005QUQP76|5.0|If you spend the majority of your day and/or night with a mouse in your hand then this mouse is for you. Combined with the \\"My Perfect Kitchen Glass Workstop Saver\\" Cutting board as a mouse surface the feel of the mouse slide is like \\"butter\\".  The cutting board mention does not work with some laser mice, but with the Vengenance M60 an incredibly smooth slide experience is found. The heavy glass has a grainy finish that prevents \\"stickation\\" and as it says on its label \\"Resists Oder and stains, Non-Porous and Non Absorbent, Dishwasher Safe (LOL!). The larger 20 in X 16 is only $10 at Bed Bath and Beyond, much less then those expensive aluminum gamer mouse pads. So if you want the smoothest mouse slide on the planet, this combination is for you, a gaming mouse that is also great for business use because of its simplicity, just plug-in and it works.

B000063UR1|4.0|Boy, have there been some scathing reviews in this forum of this film, but a modest budget was in play when it was shot, so back off a little. Besides 2001: A Space Odyssey, Silent Running was one of those few childhood cinematic events that drove me to the theater on at least three more occasions to bask in its excellence after it was first released. Everything about it was seemingly right on the money, science fiction-wise, and one viewing wasn't enough. And when it finally hit prime time a few short years later, nothing was lost in the hand-off to the little screen except the big screen experience. Irksome though was the use of the exterior shots of the film's spaceship in an episode of the first Battlestar Gallactica series.<br /><br />Well, I finally went ahead and bought the 2002 DVD release of 'Running a few years ago and had trouble with some of the now immediate chintzy elements of the film that are hard to forgive, like: Bruce Dern's less-than-adequate-looking bodysuit-space suit when he's outside the ship talking to a robot (called \\"drones\\" in the film); the camera pulling away from the spaceship Valley Forge as Dern is seen preparing a meal through a large window that entirely disappears when the shot transitions to a larger view of the ship; the goofiness of the 20th century electronics surrounding Dern in the ship's interiors; and some of Dern's wild-eyed histrionics, especially as he tries to solicit sympathy from his apathetic shipmates for a child in a photo who will never experience nature due to their employer's resolve to destroy their ship's cargo (the tears Dern's crumpled face tries to squeeze out never come in perhaps one of the hammiest scenes ever delivered by a thespian; Hormel and Farmer John would be proud).<br /><br />But that's about all the negative critique I can muster. The rest of the film was bitchin'. The use of (spoiler alert) amputees for the three drones was about as clever as it gets. There was a naturalness in the interplaybetween Dern and the three other actors on board the Valley Forge: Cliff Potts, Jesse Vint, and Ron Rifkin. The latter group's eagerness to \\"blow the pods\\" and get back down to Earth, home, and regular lives aids the pathos of Dern's actions and the pacing of the film's plot. Using a real-life, decommissioned aircraft carrier (the actual Valley Forge) for the ship's interiors gave the film a nifty scope in terms of the ship's size. The perilous crossing through Saturn's rings was probably about the best visual special effects that could be mustered at the time. When Dern and crew arms the nuclear detonators, the tension is high, and the resultant explosions are a fair enough fireworks show. And let's not forget the over-the-radio voices of Roy Engel and Joseph Campanella (\\"Big Billy wants to go!\\") as the officious types prodding Dern on to stoic resolve. They're perfect but sadly uncredited for their great work. And using hippy era-hold over Joan Baez to warble two fine songs during key moments in the film was genuine inspiration-she never sounded better.<br /><br />The big plus is Dern. Before 'Running, he'd toiled for years as an actor in small parts in big productions, both on film and in television. This was undoubtedly his breakout role, and (besides what's already been noted here) he acts his heart out. He soon became a big enough name in the kinds of parts that finally complimented the longevity of his career. It's evident that 'Running would certainly have suffered with any most other fledgling actors besides Dern in the lead. He brought loads of acting experience to the affair that made it that more terrific.<br /><br />Lastly, any film helmed by Douglas Trumbull, a guy who rubbed shoulders with Kubrick during the filming of the greatest science fiction motion picture ever made, can't be all bad. If he had just had a little more money... .
B001TAFCBC|5.0|I will admit the first time I watched it I was somewhat lost. It isn't overly complicated or deep like most people keep commenting, it just has a great twist that you don't catch onto until the end. I think that's what I loved about it the most. So many movies are painfully predictable, especially romantic movies, and I guess it might be a little bit predictable in the sense the guy gets the girl but the ride is so much more than that. Everyone has felt this kind of heartbreak and loss and everyone has wanted nothing more than to forget it ever happened. I love that. Who doesn't want to realize the one they let go (forgot) was really someone they needed to be with all along. Its a long shot but it feels good. So if you want to just get lost in a love story then this is certainly for you.
B005D9B9K8|5.0|I ENJOYED SO MUCH WATCHING THIS VIDEO. I AM A TOTAL FAN OF TAKE THAT ESPECIALLY GARY BARLOW..THE BLU RAY IS VERY CLEAR AND THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT..
B007ORWL3G|5.0|What a lot of people are missing is that this beginning to the season is about how though the characters are mostly static, the world around them is changing. Before it was like watching aliens due to how removed the culture was from our own, but now it's becoming something more familiar, and increasing Don and Pete are the out of place ones, not the audience.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I'm not a collector, I was simply someone looking for a solid quality watch that I can wear every day and will do what I want. I think I have that in this watch. The features I got it for:<br />Seiko's Lumibright luminescence, works all night.<br />The day/date display.<br />The screw down crown at the 4:00 o'clock position<br />The sweep second hand of an automatic is simply attractive.<br />The fact that it is not \\"hackable\\" is actually a feature to me because it reminds me that no two clocks are exactly the same anyway, even atomic clocks and I don't need to be that precise, well ever. That being said though, I have only had to watch a short time but since I wear it everyday the accuracy has been much better than I expected out of an automatic, a week and a half and it is still within 1 min. I also was not concerned about buying \\"grey market\\" from Mrwatch because I was not looking for a collectors item just a good watch. That being said I received the watch quickly and exactly as advertised. I would highly recommend both the watch and the vendor.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is the first Tina Fey book I have read. The only thing is I bet the audio version would be even better. As I was reading I kept trying to imagine Tina Fey actually delivering these humorous comments.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|I have about 10-15 regular housings for various purposes but decided to buy the skeleton housing for better sound.  Not only has the sound improved (obviously for use in non water / extreme conditions), but I find myself wanting to use the gopro more often as I can charge the thing without taking it out of the housing and I can insert/remove the SD card easily.  This is now my housing of choice.  A must have also if you use an external mic.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased.
B006L1GNHQ|5.0|I can't say how addicted I am to this series .  It isn't often I become so attached to a show.  The amazon instant play is the most convenient way to watch it for me ....so five stars all the way ! :)
0316286850|2.0|I think this book must be for looks in the 80s and 90s. Totally out of date and the information is cluttered. The looks were not good either, unless you like bland or covered in glitter... and nothing in between.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book a year ago, and I just saw the movie version last night.  Overall I really enjoyed The Hunger Games.  The plot drew you in from page one, and overall the characters were believable, even in the dystopian setting.  After watching the movie, my husband and I noted that in both the book and the movie, there were a few too many \\"happy accidents\\" that saved Katniss (the main character) during the games, but regardless, the book was a fun read, and I'd recommend it to almost anyone.
1118156307|2.0|Was browsing through the book in a bookstore and really hoping that I would be sold enough to buy it, but I didn't buy it because:<br /><br />1. It is a shallow skim which gives you a-list-in-one of the methods used in service design thinking but doesn't really go in-depth (most of the methods I already came across with while doing my online research and the book didn't really offer sufficiently more content)<br /><br />2.  While there are case studies, they serve to repeat what methods they used to solve problems but not much on what other creative ways they used to apply the methods.<br /><br />It is good if:<br /><br />- you just want an easy reference point that you can go back to to before you do more in-depth research or development.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This story shows the complexity and brokenness of human nature through the eyes of a young girl. Victoria was abandoned at birth by her mother. She never knew her mother or her father. Jerked from foster care to foster care, she understandably lacks stability, love and self-esteem.<br /><br />Year after year her insecurity and hesitancy to attach to any human being grows. Any human touch causes Victoria nausea and potential vomiting. Until she meets Elizabeth at age 10. Elizabeth is a vineyard owner and becomes her temporary guardian. This home is finally where Victoria begins to feel what real love might feel like.<br /><br />I realize the book is not categorized as inspirational/religious, but I saw unconditional love played out in the part of Elisabeth. Elisabeth told Victoria repeatedly that there was nothing she could do to cause her to give her up or to not love her. Victoria still tries the limits of this love on more than one occasion. Yet Elisabeth never withdraws her love or gives up on winning her back again. Just like God never gives up on us no matter how many times we mess up. He's always willing to take us back under his wing of protection.<br /><br />Then came the fire, hospitalization for Victoria, and Elisabeth disappeared from Victoria's life. Unfortunately, she's left with no choice, so it's back into the flawed foster child system where she stays until she becomes emancipated from a group home.<br /><br />A form of redemption came into Victoria's life when she met Renata, owner of Bloom flower shop. Renata hires Victoria to work for her at the flower shop. Renata seems to understand Victoria's complexity and need for her own space. Victoria begins to bloom and blossom as she creates arrangements according to the client's needs -- almost to a magical point. Client's personal relationships improved according to the flowers Victoria's arranged and delivered. Hence, the flower shop prospered and Victoria matures.<br /><br />The author goes into great detail about plants and flowers describing their unique meanings. I looked forward to learning, along with Victoria, the history and thinking behind each flower and grew to love flowers even more as I read the story. \\"The Victorian language of flowers was used to convey romantic expressions: honeysuckle for devotion, aster for patience, and red roses for love. But for Victoria Jones, it's been more useful in communicating grief, mistrust, and solitude.\\"<br /><br />The main character, Victoria, deals with deep-rooted woundedness and unresolved self-esteem issues her entire life. She resists anyone who tries to get close to her emotionally or physically by acting out in uncivil ways. As a reader, I personally felt the pain of the underdog, the unwanted, unloved and pushed aside in society. I wanted to reach out and adopt Victoria myself!<br /><br />The Language of Flowers deals with complex human nature and social issues. I found the book to be very intriguing and swept me right along from start to finish.
B0040HO16S|5.0|What a great escape!  If you want to watch a well acted series that leaves you happy and contented after every episode, then Lark Rise to Candleford should be on your viewing schedule.  It is well worth your time to try at least one episode.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am so happy this book came in the trilogy because I read through them so quickly and would have been irritated if I had to stop and wait for the next book to load before I could start reading it.  Just saw the first movie this weekend and can't believe I have to wait a year for the next one.  NOT COOL!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A true dystopic novel deals not only with the eery and strange society of a not-too-distant future, but also with the specific individuals that make up that society. Wool will answer some of the questions that you're sure to ask once you understand the scope of this future world, but it generally seeks to paint a picture of those individuals who have asked the same questions that you as a reader have asked and how those individuals respond to the varying degrees of knowledge or speculation that they have about the society into which they've been born. Overall a great book and I look forward to reading some of Hugh Howey's other works.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Best book since Run a Way Jury.  Great writing by a great story teller. Can't wait for the next book of this type.
1576875776|1.0|Got my copy of Vivian Maier. I will be returning it. I can understand the blank pages and very much appreciate Maloof's herculean efforts to get out Maier's work. Unfortunately, I do not see why the creators of this book changed the colors of the photographs. They are not true black and white and do not come close to the color quality of photographs I have seen on the web. The blacks are bleached out and the silvers are bland. All of it screaming WRONG WRONG WRONG.<br /><br />Vivian Maier deserves a true photography book not some cheapened compilation. I'd pay more for a book that presents her work in a truer manner. What surprises me is that even the four star reviews mention the cruddy prints of this book. Maybe they're satisfied with that. I, for one am not. If I'm going to lay down some cash for a book, it better be something I can appreciate rather than look at with regret that the creators obviously screwed up.<br /><br />If there is a printing of this book that is not full of sepia and diminished blacks? Do you know which printing it is? There seems to be conflicting information in these reviews about a German printing and the first printing. Please let us know which printing is best so we can avoid the inferior ones.
B004LZF2LW|3.0|its cool but you only get the time in places around I wanted to see the time in places like Japan Britan and China and that was a wast of time
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app. all the reading plans are amazing. I would definantly recommend for any one who is looking to read on the go.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its not bad.  plenty of games to keep you occupied.  you accumulate points to unlock the rest of the games since you start with only 10; the games that require you to drag something across the screen can be a little annoying cause the controls are a tad awkward
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I LOVE the game but my friend mentioned a danger zone and the eagle is gone.  Also when it says commingled soon on anything but seasons, it never comes.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great read, easy to get through.  Once you start, prepare to not be able to put it down.  It has a dark side to it, probably not good for kids under 12.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Awesome action, gore, and special effects. Kate Beckinsale is BEAUTIFUL. DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR (2012)!!!!
B00000K3D4|4.0|Watched as a kid and fell in love with this movie. It was a must buy to share with my children who also love this movie.
B0012BV9FG|5.0|This is one of the Scheich dinos we've bought our son, and to all of us, it \\"completes\\" the family.  There is something absolutely majestic about this replica, and sitting with some of the other models, it provides this towering effect that reminds us how great these beasts were in comparison to other animals.  The only complaint I have is that the paint seems to be wearing off at the tail, but I suppose that's expected with daily rough handling by a two and a half year old.  The detail is fantastic, and the eyes are painted on as very kind, and overall, despite its size, does not scare the little guy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great read and well worth the price. Anybody looking to read the Hunger Games should plan from the start to read all three.
0062082353|5.0|A great, entertaining story of a true hero.  In a seemingly simple manner Chris portrays that elusive cowboy nature - reasoning, logic without excess baggage pulling them down -  perfectly.  I am glad to know there are still some 'real men' left and here to protect us.  Thank you Chris Kyle.
B004LZF2LW|2.0|This app appears functional and does everything right, has nice widgets, etc., but $2.99 is totally unreasonable for the limited functionality this app actually has. Apps like this really bother me because they don't require any actual programming on the part if the developer, merely someone to take the time to do it. It's like busywork! This developer is really full of him- or herself. Don't pay $2.99 for this app!

B005KP7EK4|4.0|I don't know why Amazon describe it as \\"Thrilling\\".  This is an excellent, thoughtfully made film with very good performances from the 3 main characters.<br />Just don't come looking for thrills...
143512975X|4.0|My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me.  There is a great difference.\\"<br /><br />The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body.  Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.<br /><br />Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc.  It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde.  The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|When Angry Birds space hit the market, I was a little sceptical about how good it would be. Recently,  the franchise has been spouting out games that are essentially remakes of the original. Angry Birds Space, however, is the wake up call that the series so badly needed. highly recommended!
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Great app.  I love to know the time of other areas in the country and around the world. the added alarm is a bonus.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I want to begin by saying I really enjoyed this book. The title Beautiful Disaster describes this book perfectly. It is about Abby a college student and her dysfunctional relationship with her friend turned bf Travis. Young love can be intense, and I enjoyed living on the wild side with Abby and Travis. Their relationship kept me thoroughly entertained. I have read some of the reviews and I want to say that people have to understand that is a fictional book written for the sole purpose of entertainment. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Either you liked it of you didn't. I DID!! I would definitely recommend this book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just love this show. The story was fresh, acting great, and characters well developed. It's a pity it wasn't picked up for more seasons. It's a good thing I can watch the episodes over and over again, they are always funny.

B005NKGEP2|5.0|I loved this book, and read it in a day.  I couldn't put it down!  It is the story of a woman who has given up her CIA career for her family, only to discover that she isn't the only one who has secrets. I loved the European locales, and I enjoyed the children. My only beef with the book is the timeline shifts.  I understand the reason for them, but it made it a little hard to follow at times.  Nevertheless, I thought it was a great read.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Where to even begin describing the wonder that is this book??<br /><br />The characters are immediately and thoroughly relatable. I'm not only invested in them, I'd like to put them on my Christmas card list. Lake, especially, is remarkable. Bucking the recent trends of silly, navel-gazing YA heroines, this girl is real and consistent and likeable. And Will is... well, let's just say that I wish I'd had a Will when I was 18.<br /><br />The story is really well-told and well-developed. The relationship, in all it's heartbreaking, cringe-worthy, joyous glory, unfolds organically. I felt as blind-sided by the... ethical dilemma... as the characters were. (I honestly can't remember the last time I was surprised by a plot twist that way... and I read a LOT.) The coming together and falling apart... it's magical. Like butterflying beautiful poetry.<br /><br />And ohmyhead the POETRY! Beyond incredible.<br /><br />Yeah, there are typos. Big whoop. It's a sign of the strength of the story that even a grammar-nerd like me doesn't find them jarring enough to detract from the flow of the story.<br /><br />I could not recommend this book more highly, even at 10x the price.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|I've downloaded quite a few world clock apps and this is one of the best.  Like the globe view.  All the locations I searched for were found.

B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I was looking for a pack that would hold more than just my camera but not much more... I was frustrated because most packs that I found were all about the camera - plenty of room for lenses and accessories but not those other travel essentials.  Or, if the pack could carry those essentials it was way too large.<br /><br />This one is right in the sweet spot - a super convenient dedicated side-access pouch for your SLR+lens; and then a roomy interior for those things you also want to carry in a pack like a wind breaker or rain jacket, some snacks, etc.  The slim pouch inside will hold an iPad no problem; probably not a full sized laptop.  There is a water bottle pocket on the side, and a couple of extra places for cell phones and other small/slim stuff.<br /><br />I usually pack this with a DSLR+ attached lens in the side pocket, then an extra lens in the main compartment, then some clothing and snacks to accommodate the kids that usually travel with me.  I wear it as a backpack, sometimes single strapped, and sometimes I use the convenient handle and one-hand it.<br /><br />I am really pleased to have found a well-made pack that is just the right size for the few things I want to carry in addition to my camera.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|Yeah, all these negative comments about &quot;don't buy this for a child.&quot; or &quot;You may have to buy things with real money.&quot; are unnecessary. It NOTES that in the about the game thing. This is one of the best games I have ever played. Along with Bakery Story and Fashion Story. Keep it up TeamLava!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I haven't played TOO much mahjong...but this game is pretty addicting and the story makes it even more fun! Definitely recommended.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this app and you will too!!!!!!!!!!  this is good for all ages and fun. you can even get different outfits for your squirrel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game<br />I liked it on the last levels now and just got it a few days ago its free and worth it
B0050DIWFC|1.0|So, unless I missed something, at the end of the book, you still don't know if Jacob is guilty or not. Are you just supposed to assume he is guilty, or is he innocent? And what's with the mother??
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a high quality casual puzzle solving game that does a great job in utilizing the touch screen of your phone or tablet device. A lot of fun for kids and adults alike. You get a lot of game for very little money. Two thumbs up!
B004LZF2LW|1.0|don't. mean to make anyone. mad but I agree with gamer I am sure I said the same thing last week about the crapy apps come on amazon not like its really free!  we have to pay to get free apps!!!!!!!!
B001GQSY64|4.0|The story is the starting point for the Clone Wars TV series. Some what comical at times but full of action that's safe for the whole family.
B000000SDB|3.0|The item was advertised as a 5 cd set of all 9 Beethoven Symphonies.  The single disc sent was disc #5 - Symphony Number 9 only.  When I pointed this out to the seller my money was refunded
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love Amazon..Been using for a long time and never once have had a complaint..Thank You..I suggest Amazon to all my friends and i have lots of family who also uses Amazon as well
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout video has the premise that 20 minutes a day of intense exercise can firm you up and make you feel better about yourself. I was skeptical but was willing to give it a try. \\"Jullian Michaels - 30 Day Shred\\" really works. I think the 20 minutes a day approach is what had kept me at it. My abs are getting firmer and I do feel better about myself. I seem to have more energy as well. I have almost completed the 30 days and will probably continue passed 30 days. Jullian Michaels calls herself the toughest trainer, but she has a pleasant way of of pushing you, which I like. There are three levels to this program. I've gotten to Level Two and plan on getting to Level Three soon. I highly recommend this exercise video.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent product. Good study materials and audio. Highly recommended! Reminds you of your study plans and keeps you up to date.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I saw all of these crazy reviews and was kind of suspicious. I mean, really, all of these wonderful reviews. Really? Undaunted, I tried \\"Wool\\" despite the masses telling me how great it is. I've got to admit - all of the positive reviews are dead on, 100% correct. This is a really special world that Hugh created. I was locked in from the beginning, and was amazed how quickly all five books sped by. I highly recommend this book.
B00756GKBA|5.0|This stands up well against anything out there today and that's what I'll judge it on. I almost unfairly expect more of Madonna than most other artists because that is what she has gotten me used to as an artist.<br /><br />Gang Bang is a stand out in MDNA. Masterpiece is a solid ballad sung beautifully. Falling Free and I Bleeped Up are ballads of an unusual nature. Both have grown on me a lot. Love Spent has as well. The dance songs, once again, stand up well against anything out there today.
B004498KPU|5.0|This 3-disc set shows every Michael Jackson video he ever made, minus \\"Captain Eo\\" from Disney World.  My only regret is that the video for \\"Smooth Criminal\\" was not the full-length video from \\"Moonwalker\\" which included the interaction with Joe Pesci's character.  Aside from that, this video set is great for any Michael Jackson fan!
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Wow the bad reviews surprised me.  It was a great story that teaches the kiddos (and maybe some adults too) that having integrity, humility and courage is better than 'flying' (being cool and having everyone worship you when you are just a big ol fake anyway).  It also had a great theme of causality and how we are all interconnected and how we can come together to conquer hopeless situations.<br /><br />It made me sad about the loss of Brittany Murphy as Gloria but Pink was amazing.  I am obsessed with the songs!  I absolutely love this movie!!!
B00756GKBA|5.0|Honestly, I love this album. If I were being truly honest I would give it an 8 out of 10. Still 5 stars though. I pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition the day it was available for pre-order on iTunes. I've listened to it 2 times all the way through and it is a pretty solid album. \\"B-day Song\\" is kinda bad, but besides that it's solid. \\"Masterpiece\\" and \\"Falling Free\\" are a tiny bit too slow for me, but I don't hate them. I can't wait to see her on tour. I'm sure she'll be amazing as always. :)
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|evermore is a must have. yes if you are using the kindle fire there may be things you can not use but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get this FREE app. you can upload images, write notes plus if you use drop box or another syncing app you can post documents off your computer onto it. give evermore a try. its FREE..
B005K17RU0|4.0|Stays fairly accurate, but wish it would come with severe weather alerts or multiple locations saved.  Since I have family across the country.  That would give it 5 stars.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|great new idea and super fun to play but only 2 levels. gravity fields create a new way to play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun and addicting.  I love it and play it way too much.  I like that if you don't like one of the games there are a hundred others to play.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game. simple enough for kids to play easier levels, but can challenge yourself as get into jarder levels and trying to get minimun moves.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a science fiction action film.<br /><br />The narrative is futuristic with a wide social class system that divides the affluent capitol and 12 oppressed districts. This repression is the consequence of an apocalyptic conflict which occurred over 75 years prior to when the story is set.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are both from the coal mining District 12. The film essentially focuses on their participation in the 74th Hunger Games, which is a last person standing contest to the death, and it is a major entertainment event for the people of the capitol. Every aspect of the sadistic games is televised as a form of socially accepted viewing.<br /><br />It is the battle for survival that has the capacity to emancipate the winner from their district, yet the chance for a better life has a different value amongst the contestants. Some approach the contest with the utmost humanity and others are blood thirsty butchers.<br /><br />In amongst this totalitarian state that craves violence for entertainment is some humanity, and the weakest people find satisfaction in simple freedoms that are often taken for granted, which gives the viewer plenty to think about.<br /><br />The quality of acting is strong and the warmth conveyed between Katniss and Rue is film time that leaves the viewer with goose bumps.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
0316113506|5.0|This book really deserves a 5-star rating. Not because it's one of those \\"almost perfect\\" books, but because of the meaningful impact it will probably have in the life of the reader.<br /><br />You'll be eager and excited to seriously insert exercise in your daily routine after reading this. The positive consequences mentioned in the book are all really visible to anyone after a few weeks or months of training.<br /><br />When I first saw the book, I thought \\"how could anyone write a WHOLE book on the relationship between exercise and the brain?\\". In [[ASIN:0979777747 Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School]] by John Medina, the subject deserved only a chapter, and it seemed more than enough!<br /><br />To my surprise, it's really a pleasure to read the whole book. Surely, sometimes the book can be repetitive - the separate chapters dedicated to anxiety, attention, aging, etc, could easily been made as subsections of a same chapter, if the format was a paper/article instead of a book. Still, although the main logic is the same across all chapters, each one adds at least one important aspect or nuance to the subject.<br /><br />Some people might also think that the biological explanations are more detailed than they should, but you can easily skip them if you want to. Despite possibly making the reading less pleasurable for some of the people, I still think they are needed, as they make the book much more suitable to doctors who don't work in the neurology field. This probably helps to spread the word along the medical world, which is very important as well.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|Nice! One of the best multiple zone clock apps. Spinnable globe is nice touch. multiple time zones, graphic display, easy config.  this app has it all<br />recommended.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|Several great actors playing historical figures doesn't always equal a great movie. A DANGEROUS METHOD brings us some little known history and the interactions between Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and someone I had never heard of - Sabina Spielrein.<br />Speilrein is an emotionally damaged woman who is sent to Jung for psycho-analysis. Jung follows Freud's methods but also has his own ideas. Jung and Freud become friends and mentors to each other as well as sparring partners over their believes. Jung becomes sexually involved with Spielrein and nothing is ever the same.<br /><br />A DANGEROUS METHOD is a beautifully films period piece taking place in the early 20th century. The visuals are a treat to the eye. Costumes and location add an extreme reality to this film. The main problem is there really is not much of interest in this film as the trio work out the problems. Three brilliant minds become intertwinned and there is not much resolution. Vincent Cassel also stars as another as another brilliant analyst with his on set of psychological problems.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the film were the final comments on screen as to what happened to the main players. What happened to Spielrein after she returned to Russia and became a great analyst in her own right is sadly amazing. There is fascinating story that needs to be told.<br /><br />A fine cast in a mediocre film sums it up.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Have you heard the one about the clumsy, flush-prone brunette who used to live with her harebrained mother in the arid desert but went to live with her taciturn father in the Olympic Peninsula when her mother remarried and moved to the deep south with her new husband? The girl meets an inhumanely gorgeous, sulky young man with dishevelled, copper-coloured locks, and although she is initially intimidated by him, she quickly falls head over heels in love. Despite his temper and self-hatred for what he is, he reciprocates with obsessive and possessive love.<br /><br />Oh, you have?<br /><br />OK, so there are subtle differences. For instance, Christian does not sparkle in sunlight. Still, I am astounded that Stephenie Meyer's lawyers did not bombard E. L. James with \\"cease and desist\\" letters. I mean, some of the dialogue is same word for word. And despite the Find/Replace name changes, you'd have to be really thick not to put two and two together.<br /><br />Anyway. So is \\"Fifty Shades\\" any good? Well, from a literary point of view: no, it's not. Sentence construction is often awkward, spelling and punctuation is lacking. The frequency of \\"Holy f***/s***/cow\\" is bordering on ridiculous. There is nothing remarkable about the story line or dialogue. The sex scenes, which are really the only reason for the book's existence, become so repetitive after a few trysts that you literally stop and think \\"Hey, didn't I just read this?\\". I swear, if I read about Edw... I mean, Christian, \\"finding his release\\" one more time, I'm going to scream.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I purchased and read all three books in the series. Now, you might ask, considering the above, why would I do that? Well, to be honest, for someone who is Team E. all the way, the books did provide some entertainment for dreary commutes. They had their moments, albeit rare. I wouldn't rave about them exactly, and I don't hold much interest in the rumoured film/TV series, but they're not the worst books out therefor some mindless reading, if you're into that kind of thing.<br /><br />Seriously, ladies: if you loved \\"Fifty Shades\\", read the Twilight books. Sure, they're much more chaste and fade-to-black, but the emotional intensity is there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was simply amazing. The characters, the world, the descriptions and the suspense made the book fascinating to me. The plot itself made the book interesting and unique.<br /><br />The writing was simple but still engaging. The voice of Katniss was at times beautiful and torturing because of what she put herself through but I never once didn't like her. I got frustrated with her but never once did I not stop loving who this hard, cold girl was.<br /><br />What made the book for me, though, was Peeta. I was rooting for him for the whole book. His love for Katniss was something special even when he realized Katniss's feelings may not be as genuine as he thought. He almost gave up his life numerous times to save hers and that made something special bloom inside me for him. Just love that boy. Waaaaaay more than I like Gale.<br /><br />The plot was something different and one that had me on the edge of my seat because in this dystopia/post apocalyptic world people are sacrificed every year in a barbaric game called The Hunger Games. It was excruciating to read because only one victor can live which means we go through reading knowing people will die. Even the ones we grow to love and adore. While it was excruciating, I couldn't stop reading it. I never once wanted to put the book down. In fact, I wanted it to be longer so I could keep reading and reading. But eventually, I had to move onto book two.
0439023521|1.0|I purchased this book about a month ago, and they said that, it should be here between March 9th ~ March 20th or something but it definitely said before Apirl. However, not only I have not gotten the book yet, they charged me. WTF?
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I hate to exercise.  Just wanted to get that out of the way.  I do manage to walk 7-10 miles a week.  But its the other stuff I never find time for.  so, one day I see this little free app on Amazon and I thought, ok, I'll give it a whirl.  You never know when in your busy day you will find the time to do the extra stuff you never have time for.  I have found that I now make time for 5 minutes here and there for this app. The first time I tried it, I thought, this can't possible help.  The next day, after I was so sore I couldn't even do the exercises, I thought, gosh, I still have still have muscles in there! I now do this app 4-5 times a week and have down loaded the others that the creator has developed. I like that you can mix it up with different exercises so you don't get bored. I plan on purchasing the full version of this.
B003B02O14|5.0|This is is one of Gresham's best. I have read almost all of his books.  It is a fast read and keeps the reader's interest to the surprising conclusion.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|Runs well on a rooted B&amp;N Book Tablet, even w/o GPS. For my needs, precise location is not a requirement.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I think Rovio really messed up this time.  Right now everyone thinks  change should happen.  For some things yes but angry birds no.  This game would be better if they had new birds not entire new maps.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham books are always a good read.  A story of how good triumphs over greed.  You are taken in right from the start and cannot put the book down.
B005EGXSWW|5.0|Amazing. Harry Hole is back grittier than ever and larger than life. He spends a good part of the book running around with a gash in his throat ducktaped. The story is told in large part by a corpse. . . and by the rat trying to get to her babies. It is hard to put down and when you get to the end, you are not quite sure you believe it. so you re-read the end . .  and then you re-read the beginning.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a great book!  I enjoyed every minute of it. The ending, I never expected.  I look forward to reading more by this author.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Personally, I was quite skeptical to read The Hunger Games. I had heard about it when it came out in 2008, and it interested me a bit, but not to the point of reading it. When I heard there was a movie in production, I figured to give it a shot. That must mean it's pretty good right? Wrong! The book was GREAT! The book is written in a easy-to-read kind of format, so blowing through it in one sitting is quite average. I read the whole trilogy in 3 days myself. Also, many people get caught up on the darkness and violence of the first book in the trilogy. Please, do not let that stop you from reading the remaining books and do not let that be the sole determinant of whether or not you like the book. The plot goes much deeper than you would realize from the first book. Yes, it does get darker and it is still violent, but it is a great read. It's a fast-paced, no-nonsense kind of book. I promise, every line written by Collins serves a purpose in future books. If you did not like the 1st book (The Hunger Games) I encourage you to continue to read the series. You may be surprised at how much you enjoy it once you finish.<br /><br />And for those of use who aren't teenagers, I am in my 20s, so this story can be compelling to an older audience too. I hope you all enjoy this!
0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's writing about the most difficult emotions - guilt, shame, grief and rage - is so on-target and familiar there is a way in which she really is talking about not just her emotions but all of ours.  When she applies her profound generosity to the act of transforming or transcending these emotions it seems it is actually healing to the reader.

B00756GKBA|3.0|The first time I listened to this album, I didn't like it at all, and I really felt disappointed. I thought it was awful, confused, over produced, and I couldn't find any real song on it. Well, now I've completely changed my mind: I really like this album, I like almost all the songs (I'm not really fond of I'm addicted) and now I think I can write my review. This album is Madonna having fun while sounding at times extremely honest. This album has some emergency, it's fresh and full of melodies and ideas. BUT I think the biggest mistake is in the sequence of the songs. Too many fast songs without a pause...<br /><br />So I built my personal MDNA which is a perfect album to my ears: leave out I'm addicted and add:<br /><br />3. Beautiful killer<br />4. I ...d up.<br /><br />In this way the album is really beautiful, has a better flow, it is often sweet and more balanced.<br /><br />Madonna is not trying to repeat herself, and I guess that if she wanted, that could be extremely easy, given that she could just choose to pick up the best songs from the best authors and sing them. Instead we have here a quite honest woman who's still having fun making music and is still giving us something new. Gang B. is different from everything she's done before, so is the beautiful Falling free. Many are the very pleasant and funny songs. Of course someone may find some fillers, (I don't) but which album hasn't? \\"Give me all your loving\\", so hated, could be easily left out, but Madonna has always liked to be silly sometimes, or at least fun, without too many thoughts: do you remember Jimmy Jimmy? True blue is such a great pop record! I will be happy if I'm still a little bit (just a little bit!) silly when I'm 53! Madonna has still that something...more.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|Okay, I can perhaps understand the need for course and fine GPS locations if the app sets the time based on your location but why does it need to \\"open network sockets\\" to have internet access.  The dev should explain the need for such permissions to help us understand why a clock app wants to get on the internet.  Too much of a security breach for me.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Dev promptly addressed my concerns over permissions and explained why app needed socket access permission.  The explaination made sense and didn't indicate anything overly malicious. I installed app and it appears to do what it says. Many options for adding clocks in different time zones and customizing them. I personally would like more widget size options but there are enough to choose from. I've not tried the alarm feature yet so I can't comment of that. I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I have had this headset for about a week now and I have to say that I really like it.  I've purchased other headsets in the past and they do not fit my head or break shortly after using.  This headset is durable and fits comfortably around my huge noggin.  It's worth the price.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This DVD isn't too bad and does provide several good workouts. However, there are only three workouts and it can get repetitive doing the same three day after day. In addition, the instructor doesn't even do most of the exercises, and something about that bothers me.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I don't have hbo and admittely \\"Game of Thrones\\" is not my cup of tea usually until I was hanging out at a friends house and we came across I want to say Episode 5. It is a fantastic series and from what I'm told is pretty faithful to the book, despite the source matierial being a series of 500 plus page books. The best thing about the dvds are the commentatries and making of featurrettes, I'm a film geek and I find all of that stuff fascinating. The \\"Pilot\\" episode starts out with a hermitically seaed world, with \\"The Wall\\" after a beheading or 2 (1 of which you see) we then smash cut tothe best opening title sequence in film tv or any other medium that establishes, the world of \\"Westeroes\\" all other episodes start out with the opening sequence. The pilot episode ends, with a splat. Before all of that though I read \\"EW\\" where there was a picture of a major character about to be executed, in te picture in the magazie the character is \\"blurkled\\" out so you don't know who it is, so that was cool, however with their year end 'best of 2011' they went ahead and said who it was, and they did the same thing for \\"Breaking Bad\\" so we do live in a day and an age where information dispertion is instantaneous, so even if you pick up bits and pieces of things still go ahead and watch \\"Game of Thrones\\" $30.00 well spent. Also I have come up with a plan for season 2 where my buddy is going to DVR the episodes and every 2 weeks we wll watch said episodes so that works.
0307949486|1.0|I can't imagine anyone voting for the book or the movie to be a best seller. The book was boring and very difficult to get in to.  The movie was even worse.  I regret having to have paid to be bored to death.  It was slow moving, dull and not at all entertaining.  Don't waste your money.
B004CHURRS|5.0|As a self-styled Cleopatra buff I have long sought out cultural representations of the Queen of the Nile high, low, & middle (check out the swinging 60's style Cleopatra Leslie Uggams creates on the \\"Her First Roman\\" cast album).  When I saw that Handel's Giulio Cesare  is going to be performed by the Met next season I took that as an omen to learn more about this rarely-performed opera, and this Virgin Classics collection of arias seemed like a price-friendly, artist-tested way to go. And I've found that Natalie Dessay,when healthy,  is an artist  who is never delivers less than a magical performance. I'll leave it to others to determine the CD's worth in terms of technical excellence or the nuances of operatic artistry.  My approach to music, even classical music, is how it strikes me at an emotional level. On that level, this CD more than delivers the goods. I have it on my Ipod and when it comes on I feel like I'm whisked away from the subway or sidewalks  to a barge on the Nile 2,000 years ago, reclining on a throne beneath  purple sails drenched in perfume while being fanned with palm fronds and served grapes on a silver platter. And after all, isn't providing an escape from our sometimes stressful, mundane lives what listening to music is all about? The CD package includes an informative 30-page booklet that includes a summary of the story, the lyrics, and the history behind the opera, including revisions made over the years (apparently artistic revisions of existing works did not start with director-version DVDS). Recommended for: Classical music fans, especially Handel fans, opera fans, and Cleopatra completists (you know who you are).
031618201X|5.0|`Soulless' is the Yen Press manga adaptation of the first book in Gail Carriger's `Parasol Protectorate / Alexia Tarabotti' steampunk paranormal series. Art and adaptation is by Rem, lettering by JuYoun Lee.<br /><br />I love the recent trend of graphic novel adaptations. I really enjoyed Dabel Brothers `Mercy Thompson' adaptation, and I especially loved Del Rey's adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's `The Exile'. Now, I know that lots book fans haven't really embraced the graphic adaptations, for a number of reasons - some of them are valid (such as not liking character drawings to intrude and determine reader's imaginations) to the ridiculous (like lashing out at authors because they assume the graphic novel is the next book in the series, not an adaptation of the first book?!). Whatever your stance on the graphic novel debate, I truly believe that everyone should at least give these adaptations a chance, because they might surprise you. And if you're dipping your toes in the adaptation waters for the first time, I can highly recommend this manga representation of Carriger's steampunk series.<br /><br />I was curious at reading a manga `comic', when I have only ever read (and enjoyed) graphic novels. But I actually think the more comic styling of manga suits Carriger's over-the-top series. For those who are unaware - graphic novels are considered more `books' than comics, often more text-heavy and more realistic drawing representations. The Japanese word `manga' literally means comic/graphic/cartoon, so is basically the same as a graphic novel. . .  except the manga format looks less real, more anime (I guess you could say it's the difference between a drawn cartoon show, and a CGI movie?).<br /><br />Carriger's steampunk series is perfectly suited to the manga style. For one thing, the `Parasol Protectorate' book series is so rich in outlandish description (from mechanical ladybugs to luxury dirigibles) that seeing these gorgeous steampunk contraptions drawn to life will be absolutely splendid! The little drawings of steampunk machinery throughout `Soulless' are lovely and fantastical, and exactly how I pictured London when reading Carriger's books! Admittedly, `Soulless' features less of those lovely steampunk inventions than latter books in the series - indeed, this first book is more about setting up the players and meeting the characters. And I must say, artist Rem has drawn each and every one of them to a T!<br /><br />Alexia is beautifully represented, in all her big-busted, parasol-wielding glory. Actually, quite a lot is made of Alexia's *ahem* assets. . .  but it's often for a bit of light relief, like when Conall is bending over to examine a dead vampire, and just so happens to cop a lovely eyeful down Alexia's corset. I really loved Aexia's drawn fashion too - her dresses are Victorian delights, and her long locks are always a little bit unkempt and wispy (staying very true to Carriger's descriptions of her in the books). Speaking of style. . . . I also love, love, loved the mangafied Ivy Tunstell! Rem has indeed captured her outlandish dress sense; her hats are divinely flouncy and there are ruffles aplenty!<br /><br />And then there's Conall (Lord Maccon). At first I wasn't overly thrilled with his appearance - I guess I wanted him a little more rugged and Alpha manly? And I thought his semi-wolf `angry face' looked a little ridiculous (his actual werewolf does look more like a frightening wolf, it's just when he's snarling at Alexia that the ears and tail pop out for some reason). My scepticism turned to appreciation towards the end. . .  as people who read `Soulless' will remember, at the end of the book werewolf Conall is captured, and thrown into a cell with Alexia. . .  whose touch turns him human (and very, very naked). And *that* is the Conall I was imagining! He's absolutely scrumptious in his naked manga glory - all broad chest, rippling abs, not to mention firm in all the right places (insert lascivious wink).<br /><br />My other favourite drawn character was Lord Akeldama - Alexia's vampire friend and delectable cream puff. Rem has drawn a fabulously flamboyant Akeldama, and I especially liked that he's so damn attractive!<br /><br />`Soulless' is one of the best adaptations I have ever read! The manga style perfectly suits Gail Carriger's over-the-top fabulous steampunk paranormal series; from the Victorian clothes to the roped dirigibles in the park. I especially loved that the manga adaptation covers every aspect of the first book! Even if you're not so sure about illustrated adaptations, give `Soulless' a read - I think lots of sceptics will be very surprised at how wonderful this adaptation is.).<br /><br />My other favourite drawn character was Lord Akeldama - Alexia's vampire friend and delectable cream puff.

1449314287|5.0|Every chapter is very well crafted, with a precise balance between theory and practice, and full of invaluable nuggets, sometimes transcending the MySQL arena and applicable to any database! Such cases are Chapter-Benchmarking MySQL and Chapter 3-Profiling Server Performance, very solid foundations for the reading ahead.<br /><br />All over the text, authors propose tools, examples of use and proven diagnostic techniques, that will greatly improve your performance firefighter skills and enhance your knowledge of MySQL internals. Nevertheless, what gives this book the five star is taking into consideration the physical part of database structures in play when speaking about performance, which is something most authors don't include; plus treatment on MySQL high availability and cloud features, which we'll increasingly see on customers.<br /><br />There is something that kind of bugged me at times and was references to a specific commercial MySQL offering and tools, but after taking a look to that company web-site, found that is a great contributor to the MySQL community and you can actually use the tools!
B00701QVVY|5.0|Two albums that I have looked forward to the most this year...Overkill and Accept...Overkill is out and it is killer!!!! Was always a casual fan in the 80's and 90's,but then when Ironbound came out,I became a big fan...I don't know why it took so long,but it has happened...The Electric Age is not a downer from Ironbound and may be equally excellent,at least to me !!!!! There is not one weak song on the album and they are all in your face ! If you enjoyed Ironbound and all their previous work,no reason to stop at this one...Buy it and prepare to be rocked out totally !!!!!  \m/
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed all 3 books which should be read in sequence. I was surprised at the unfair treatment of women in Swedon, and at the casualness with which they deal with sex. I was also surprised that such an unlawful contingent could exist in their \\"secret service\\". May be that similar exists in the USA. All of the books were rather brutal, but contained a satisfying quantity of retribution!Larrson's descriptions were quite graphic and the scientific facts were accurate including the diagnosis of Asberger's syndrome for the \\"girl\\".<br /><br />Jack Trigg
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|Iron Maiden fans don't really care what someone might write here. They are fully aware of the fact that Iron Maiden is the greatest rock band in the world and already have this Blu-Ray as well as the CD (and the vinyl is on order).<br /><br />So I'm writing this for those who don't know as much about Iron Maiden. Watch this - as well as Flight 666 - and all will be revealed to you. Both films include excellent recent concert footage as well as superb behind the scenes documentary footage. Both movies are surprisingly engaging and are done with exceptional care and quality.<br /><br />Most who watch these movies will see band members they will actually like, admire, and relate to - regular (but extremely accomplished) guys in a not so regular profession.<br /><br />Even fans that have heard some of this material many times, own Flight 666, and have seen them live hundreds of times, will still marvel at the quality of En Vivo!  And when they are finished with the concert footage they will still have the all new documentary footage to look forward to  - footage that's worth the price all by itself.<br /><br />Truly, this is as good as it gets.
B0073W649Y|5.0|Don't be fooled by the PG 13, or the cheesy look of the cover art. This film is very, very tense and very satisfying as a horror movie. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. Don't miss this horror gem.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great application for the kindle fire. One click and you get the forecast. And the best part it is free. Doesn't get any better.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I bought this movie because i was required to watch it and review it for a class. I ended up really enjoying the movie.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|This is a pretty enjoyable album, if not on a par with classic Tull (or even contemporary Tull/Ian Anderson) in my opinion.  The songs fall into 3 categories:<br /> -7 rerecordings of classic Tull songs with a Christmassy theme/feel.  These were great songs the first time around, and are still pretty good, but if you're a Tull fan, you probably already have a (superior) version of them.  I find the lighter, more sophisticated, touch of the originals actually was much more Christmassy on songs from the 70s than the current production/sound,  while the later songs (e.g. \\"Another Christmas Song\\") don't sound too different.  Although Ian's vocals are certainly not on a par with his singing pre-1984, he does well enough here. The one standout is \\"Jack Frost & the Hooded Crow\\", which sounds fantastic here in a more robust recording than the original (which was a non-album, early 80s track that can be found on the 20th Ann. set or Broadsword remaster).  Bouree here gets a makeover to make it a bit different, with some time-signature and syncopation changes, which makes it more worth a new recording.<br />  - 5 instrumental traditional Christmas melodies (including a classical piece by Faure).  While I would love to hear Tull do these in a Renaissancy, Songs From The Wood, kind of way, the band instead decides to do a kind of cheesy jazz interpretation of them, which doesn't really work nearly as well for me.  The exception is the Faure \\"Pavanne\\", which is quite lovely (and not jazzed out).<br />  3.  The remaining 4 tracks are new Tull tunes, the only ones we've gotten for 13 years and counting!  \\"Birthday Card At Christmas\\" is a decent rock tune that would've fit on a recent Tull album.  \\"Last Man At The Party\\" is a quite good, fun, acousticy song about relatives overindulging.  \\"First Snow on Brooklyn\\" is an OK, mellow tune reminiscent of \\"White Innocence\\" or some of the last 1/3 of \\"Roots To Branches\\".  \\"A Winter Snowscape\\" is an excellent, lovely instrumental by MartinBarre, with Ian's flute complimenting what I believe was originally a Barre solo album piece.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable Tull album that's Christmas-themed but not too Christmassy to listen to out-of-season.  Not brilliant, but pretty good and with some great stuff.  (It may be noted that this is not a consistent effort by the current lineup of Tull - keyboardist Andy Giddings seems to be handling most of the bass guitar on the vocal songs, while the instrumentals have James Duncan filling in on drums.  This does not seem to harm the continuity of the album, however).

B006W0QOF2|4.0|If there were ever a definitive film to split audiences of films of the 1900s of audience accustomed to mainstream films of the 2000s onward then here it is. If this film were made in the 70s or 80s no one would bat an eye, however modern mouth breather Fast N Furious audiences hated this movie, which is a sure sign that there is some quality to be found. Rejoice the death and rejection of the classic art of cinema, hail the final days of humanity where voices are loud, IQs are low, and the idea of fine music and cinema is base level retardation. Give yourselves a pat on the back humanity, you had it coming.

B00001OH7U|5.0|The circumstances in David Bowie's life while making STATION TO STATION are often commented on: his use of drugs had got out of control, and he has later claimed not to remember a thing about its production. Taking his personal problems at the time into consideration, it is quite striking (and probably rather a compliment to his talent than to the drug-glamorizing sometimes found in rock'n'roll) that this turned out to be possibly his most interesting and consistent album. Some reviewers have remarked that such a good album would have benefited from displaying more tracks than a mere six, but I think some of the beauty of STATION TO STATION is found precisely in its relative brevity. Running at less than 40 minutes in total, the album provides a feeling of punctuality which makes the listener more attentive to its complex nuances and references; we all know that pure, simple rock'n'roll may go on forever, but a work like STATION TO STATION demands a certain degree of focus in order to be fully appreciated, which would likely become exhausting had two or three more tracks of equal quality been present. As it stands, it is one of the most homogeneous albums I've yet heard; and one of the most intense, unpredictable, and sometimes slightly bizarre.<br /><br />The title track, which unfolds the album, is Bowie's longest song in his career, as has been noted many times, and also one of his most complex. It builds itself up gradually, the mood being first set by slow, claustrophobic piano, and Bowie declaring \\"The Return of The Thin White Duke,\\" before eventually taking off in an uptempo rythm with Bowie exclaiming one of his most oft-quoted lines: \\"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love...\\" The references are too numerous to be grasped initially by any normal listener; gnosticism and Aleister Crowley are said to have been some of Bowie's influences here. Both lyrically and musically, it's undoubtedly one of his most interesting pieces. However, running at over ten minutes and with Bowie's voice absent for the first three, \\"Station to Station\\" was an impossible hit single choice, which may have been one reason why it's followed up by the most accessible track on the album, \\"Golden Years.\\" This song is sometimes critized for slightly interrupting the flow of the album, but I think it works as a fitting intermission between the complex introduction and the next, highly emotional song \\"Word on a Wing.\\" Bowie exclaiming the refrain \\"My prayer flies like a word on a wing\\" is one of his most gripping moments, and the outro of the song, with the tuned-down chorus, once tempted a few tears out of me.<br /><br />\\"TVC15\\" may be the song here I listen to the most; Bowie is at his vocally most vigorous here, which is highlighted by the (again) tuned-down saxophone towards the end of the refrains. \\"Stay\\" appears to be a follow-up to \\"Word on a Wing,\\" at least in terms of mood, though it sounds slightly less desperate. Finally, \\"Wild is the Wind\\" is admittedly the song I listen to the least here, possibly because Bowie does not provide the lyrics (with such a good lyricist, you somehow want him to have thought up every sentence...am I spoiled?), but nonetheless it serves as a very fitting conclusion to the album, Bowie making the song into his own through his incredible vocal range. When released, STATION TO STATION was generally received with applaud, and its reputation holds up to this day. There's less pure rock'n'roll to be found than in the Ziggy Stardust-era, but rather the visions of a maturing artist.However, running at over ten minutes and with Bowie's voice absent for the first three, \\"Station to Station\\" was an impossible hit single choice, which may have been one reason why it's followed up by the most accessible track on the album, \\"Golden Years.\\" This song is sometimes critized for slightly interrupting the flow of the album, but I think it works as a fitting intermission between the complex introduction and the next, highly emotional song \\"Word on a Wing.\\" Bowie exclaiming the refrain \\"My prayer flies like a word on a wing\\" is one of his most gripping moments, and the outro of the song, with the tuned-down chorus, once tempted a few tears out of me.<br /><br />\\"TVC15\\" may be the song here I listen to the most; Bowie is at his vocally most vigorous here, which is highlighted by the (again) tuned-down saxophone towards the end of the refrains. \\"Stay\\" appears to be a follow-up to \\"Word on a Wing,\\" at least in terms of mood, though it sounds slightly less desperate.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A little late in the game, here, but this book was great.  Its style is a bit juvenile, but the story is fast paced and lays the ground for two fantastic sequels.  Katniss makes for one of the best female characters I've read in a long time.
0307956350|3.0|Summary:  When Dexter Moore tells his wife of an opportunity to  redesign a bank's electronic security system in Luxemburg, Kate has mixed emotions on moving to a foreign country.  After all, she's been a  CIA agent in Washington DC for the past 15 years and her life has been exciting and totally unpredictable. Besides that, her computer geek husband doesn't have a clue what Kate does for a living.<br />Dexter's new position will be lucrative enough that Kate can now be the stay-at-home mom she has often dreamed about.  The Moore's pack up their belongings,  their 4 and 5 year old sons, and begin their new lives as expats.<br /><br />It isn't long before Kate becomes bored with the role of housewife and mother.  She tries to play the part, even joins the Luxemburg Women's Club, but living life on the edge and is much different than the hum-drum luncheons and  spending time with other expat wives. It's  just not enough for Kate Moore.  The real plot begins when Kate becomes obsessed with her husband. Why is he gone so much?  Why is he so elusive about what it is he does?  And who is this expat couple Bill and Julia Maclean that seem to `show up' wherever Kate and Dexter are?<br /><br />Something is wrong. Dexter is lying about what he does and Kate is bound and determined to use her CIA experience to find out the truth; no matter the risk or how the Maclean's try to deter her.<br /><br />Opinion: There is little doubt that Mr. Pavone is a writer.  A master of description, Pavone's plot becomes lost in translation with vivid, long-winded descriptions of people, places and things that camouflage what I would describe as an  `okay' plot. The Expats cannot be regarded as espionage fiction as there are no related international consequences to Kate's discoveries.  It's all about Kate and Dexter Moore with the Maclean's playing the mysterious side-kicks.<br /><br />I found the characters to have no real connection to each other which makes it difficult for readers to connect to them. Who is Kate?  I kept hoping I'd find out.  Does she like flowers - does she like sex - does she enjoy murdering people? All I know is that Kate is afraid the past will catch up to her.<br /><br />I want thrills when I read a thriller.  Somebody has to die, maybe a bloody massacre, someone looking over a shoulder waiting to catch another character off guard. The Expats is a predictable cat-and-mouse game that never quite spreads its wings.<br /><br />Recommendation: I would not recommend The Expats for your next read, however I would definitely stay tuned for Pavone's second book.<br /><br />Rating:  3 stars
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|Great HD transfer, tons of illuminating background material and the packaging is charming with foldout style booklet insert. This movie set the standard for high end blockbuster monster films and I still find it more satisfying than all the remakes.
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|Incredible film, not sure why there was not more nominations for academy awards, it should have won best film hands down.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic, it is #1 in my Disney Animated Movie Power Rankings. The great thing about this movie is that it is timeless, and any age will love it.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book!!  It was definitely emotional but oh, so sweet!  I stayed up until 5 AM to finish reading it and it was worth it.  I loved the second in the series, Point of Retreat, just as much if not more.  I definitely recommend this read and will be checking out Colleen Hoover's work for a long time to come!
044042321X|5.0|The seemingly everlasting winter is beginning to arrive in the Seven Kingdoms after decades of summer.  Winter emboldens some to grab power deploying various means from armed combat to magic to assassination.  North beyond the Wall, the Others like feral Wildings and creatures much more bellicose begin to invade the south starting with assaults on the House Stark fiefdom loyal to King Robert Baratheon.  In the capital King's Landing, the King's Councilor Eddard Stark of Winterfell is the actual ruler.  South of King's Landing, the Hand of the King is mysteriously dead; leaving a power vacuum for those ambitious enough to make a move.  Meanwhile King Robert and his extended family head to Eddard's home Winterfell.  Across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys of the once proud House Targaryen, former rulers of Westeros, plans to regain what his family lost by selling his sister Daenerys to Dothraki the barbarian in exchange for his military support.  Under the frozen gray of winter, loyalties will be tested.<br /><br />This graphic version of the first A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy is a great adaptation as Daniel Abraham captures the essence of George R. R. Martin's opening act (the novel not the TV show; though both are superb).  The art work by Tommy Patterson enhances the tale though there will be adjustment to his portraits as we have the HBO version of the key players and our own perceptions; think of the Jackson Lord of the Ring movies vs. how each of us perceived how the cast looked in the Tolkien books before the films.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I can't understand the negative reviews of this movie, it's great entertainment based on a popular series of stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. It's true, it doesn't follow the first book exactly but I believe it gets the feel of it. The stories were written 100 years ago and obviously alot has changed since, to include the audience and their expectations. They made a visually stunning and action packed (for the most part) movie. I sincerely hope it's successful enough for sequels. If you haven't read the books I strongly recommend you do so. I'm one who is sick of all the attention given to movies that involve magic, teen vampires, or books written by Dr. Seuss. I think this movie is for the rest of us.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|TAKEN is a great movie to watch with your teenaged daughter. I have tried for a very long time to make my child understand that sexual slavery is alive and well so I don't have to worry *as much* that she will let herself get into a precarious situation. I've recounted numerous real-life human trafficking cases to her, went through the Polaris Project's website with her, showed her FBI statistics which show that selling girls is the 2nd most profitable criminal enterprise in the world (drugs is #1,) and still felt like I was talking to a brick wall. All I got in return were eye-rolls and infamous, I-am-the-invulnerable-teenager quotes like, \\"Mom, you worry too much. I'm not stupid and that is soooo not gonna happen to me!\\"<br /><br />Then we watched TAKEN... finally, finally, finally she is starting to get it!! This movie does an excellent job of showing how quickly traffickers work and how slick they are with little girls. It conveys the terror a girl is engulfed with when she's kidnapped, how easy it is to be kidnapped, the horrible sexual and physical abuse the victim suffers (without actually showing it,) and how the average little girl would never be found because they don't have a former spy (Liam Neeson) for a parent. After watching TAKEN my daughter's entire attitude has changed for the better. She is learning martial arts, staying cognizant of her surroundings, and is also more interested in the real-life cases she didn't want to hear about before. (An excellent non-fiction book to give your teenager to read after viewing this movie is [[ASIN:0520268660 The Slave Next Door: Human Trafficking and Slavery in America Today, With a New Preface]] - actually, everyone should read it.)<br /><br />For those not interested in a mom's perspective and are reading reviews for the cinematic experience, TAKEN is a fast-paced thriller that snags your attention and keeps it the whole way through. The only truly unbelievable character in the movie is the mother, Liam Neeson's ex-wife. She's one of those TSTL (Too Stupid To Live) characters that thinks more like a know-it-all 16-year-old girl than a mature, grown woman. Luckily, she's just a side character and not in much of the movie overall.<br /><br />5 stars! Definitely worth owning

0385737955|5.0|Lord of the Flies, the Hunger Games, Tom Finder, and the Outsiders are all rolled into this one book and the students are going to love it. This book has the power to ignite the interests of the reluctant reader and will do so in a way that many of the curriculum books simply cannot. Fast-paced,and interesting throughout, students will eat this book up and I am so happy to have included it in my literature circles with my English 9 class after our class novel study reading The Hunger Games. There is violence, yes, but it's not over the top, it makes sense for the situations that these boys are in. There are hints of romantic closeness, but not an over the top romantic plot line. There are so many class conversation worthy situations, like who they would kick out of the Glade and why, or what they think the Glade is, is Wicked good, or where Grievers go at night. If you are looking for something to recommend to a student who liked the Outsiders or The Hunger Games, this is it.

The way it describes the world of a little boy is just soooooooooooooo touching, the way he bonds with his mother is a miracle.

B003Y5HWMW|1.0|We were amazed to see so much bare female skin.  Sent this one back.  Not at all enjoyable or inticing.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|No surprises here: a rich alpha male with a harrowing childhood and inner demons plucks (I choose that word deliberately) a young woman from obscurity, or in this case, college. Christian Grey decides in a few weeks that Ana Steele will be his salvation to his inner demons and is the love of his life.  Ana decides in as short a time that he is the love of her life.  If she didn't, Grey offers her the money, the sex drive, and the emotional sustenance to ensure she will.  Ana and Grey are also, Ms James assures us repeatedly, very good looking.  Ana doesn't stand a chance, and neither do we.<br /><br />Most people may focus, wrongly in my view, that sex is the only element of these books.  Don't get me wrong: there's a lot of it, it's well-written (a rarity), and it will probably introduce a lot of readers to BDSM-oriented romance.  For what it's worth, I'm more offended by Grey's taste in classical music than I am by his handcuffs.  Ignore the pearl clutchers and read the trilogy if you're interested.  It's handled responsibly.<br /><br />But it's Grey and Ana's highly emotional connection that drives their relationship, and the book.  It has to.  There's little plot or character development.  To compensate for this lack, Grey and Ana emote in a way that is simply breathtaking.  Ana cries, shakes and goes off her feed at the slightest whiff of trouble.  Grey storms about in anger, professes love and talks about sex in a straightforward manner that modern men rarely do - and I suspect, readers wish they did.  Some romance sub-genres get away by turning up the emotions to level 11 by making the stakes high - the fate of a clan might hang in the balance in a historical romance, the death of a \\"one true mate\\" or the end of the world in a paranormal.  But by placing this romance in modern time and not creating a substitute reason for the drama, the emotional toils, the alpha male posturing and the female responses (Ana rarely drives the action, or the cars) all become melodrama.<br /><br />Simply put - the stakes are never high enough to justify the high emotions, despite Ms James frantic attempts to tell us differently.  The reader is well aware after just a few pages of the first book that Ms James would never put her heroine in anything resembling true harm; she seems to have a hard enough time putting Ana in a bad dress.  Grey is never in any danger of losing his business empire, his loving adopted family or Ana.<br /><br />The conceit of a great romance is for a reader to know the ending will be happy but for the writer to be so wily as to make us forget.  Not so here, where my major concern was whether Ana will twist her heel in her new Christian Laboutins or have sex in boring place, like a bed.<br /><br />By making the stakes low and love a foregone conclusion, the resolution - such as it is - by book 3 feels as cheaply held as the string of Audi and Saabs Grey buys Ana.  (Yes, name brands have a starring role here, along with the handcuffs.)  Ana's personal evolution seems as empty.  Forget a bad dress, Ms James doesn't even let her experience the ordinary awkwardness of the post-college phase or enjoyment of simple pleasures.  Ana goes straight from a delayed adolescence - at 22 she is a virgin and socially awkward and un self-aware - to professional success, a warm social circle, and a sartorially-adept adulthood in a few short months.<br /><br />The sex and wish fulfillment make it fun; the dearth of story makes it empty.  There are better romances out there, but if you want pure frosting and fluff, this is about as sugary as it gets.

B007FH9GT2|3.0|Having both read the books and seen all the Swedish movies, I was excited to see this version.  It did not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />First, the good.  The acting in this movie is fantastic.  Rooney Mara is amazing as Lisbeth Salander, as is Daniel Craig playing Mikael Blomkvist.  All the actors do justice to their characters.  The scenery was also very close to what I'd pictured when reading the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story itself was poorly paced.  It moved too fast in some parts, and too slow in others.  There were points in the movie where I found myself thinking, \\"that's not now I remember that happening\\" and times when I'd feel like things were either out of order or a little confusing.<br /><br />I can't decide whether it's better to read the book before seeing this movie, or watch the movie first and then read the book.  It's a good movie, but for fans of the book and the Swedish movie it'll throw you off a bit.

B00005JNEW|5.0|Almost everything works in this portrait of the madness for and around<br />high-school football in a small Texas town.<br /><br />One of the best sports movies I've seen, largely because it's not really about<br />the sport, or the big game, or winning and losing.  It's about growing up, letting<br />go of dreams, the pressure adults put on kids to fulfill their own dreams, losing<br />perspective and gaining it.  It seems to try and honestly look at both sides of high<br />school football; how it helps young men grow, challenge themselves and bond,<br />but at the same time how it subjects them to physical harm, an unrealistic set of<br />expectations about life after being a local star, and being forced to carry a whole<br />town on your shoulders when you're only 17.<br /><br />Some terrific visuals, both in the quick cutting ferocity of the games, and in the<br />long aerial views of the empty Texas plains.<br /><br />It does cheat in a few moments, trying to have it's cake and eat it too - a few plot<br />lines are resolved a touch too easily or neatly, a few plot twists feel too familiar<br />from other films.  And I understand those that say the film displays a superior<br />attitude towards these small town people.  But I found those weaker moments<br />fleeting in a film that surprised me with the strength of it's acting, writing, and filmmaking.

B005FITIF0|4.0|Machine Gun Preacher is one of those movies that sneaks up on you, grabs your heart, and doesn't let go. Going into this movie, I'm a bit embarrassed to say I not only hadn't heard of Sam Childers and his work over in Sudan and Uganda, but had no idea who Joseph Kony was, the leader of the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army). But I guess that is the point of movies like this-- to educate and inform people about very serious current issues going on in the world. As a blogger, a teacher, and the type of person that is not afraid to speak my mind, I knew before the end credits rolled that I would be reviewing Machine Gun Preacher and dedicating the post to the children of Uganda and Sudan and to spread awareness so that Kony's reign of terror will end.<br /><br />Gerard Butler does a great job portraying Sam Childers, former drug dealer, heroin addict, motorcycle misfit whose first moments on the screen is him being released after doing a stint in prison. I like the fact that the movie doesn't try to sugarcoat how Sam used to be--you can add verbally abusive to his wife and not much of a father figure to his daughter to the list. But after a life changing incident, he allows his wife to clean him up and take him to the church that helped her find God (she was also a former addict & stripper).<br /><br />Now many may think this movie is \\"preachy\\" since it shows Sam being baptized and he later builds his own church--but I'm setting the record straight, this movie's agenda is not to \\"convert\\" or \\"recruit\\" people to Christianity. This is not a film in the fashion of Fireproof and Courageous. The solid R rating should attest to that. But Sam IS a born again Christian and the movie IS about his life, so of course it's going to play an important part of the film. I just wanted to clear the air for those people that may have been thinking about skipping the film because they thought Machine Gun Preacher was going to be \\"preachy\\".<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away as far as describing specific scenes since I think this movie is much more effective by watching it with your own eyes, but let me say there are definitely some shocking moments when Sam is over in Africa. Children being maimed, tortured, burned, children forced to kill other children, etc. The one scene I will divulge that pissed me off-- as it did Sam-- was actually the scene where he asks a rich businessman who praised his work over in Africa, for $5,000 which would help keep the orphanage running for another 6 months. The man invites Sam and his family over to a huge, lavish party where he hands him an envelope. Sam excuses himself to the bathroom, opens it, to find a check for....$150 dollars! WTF?? Sometimes I forget how selfish and self centered people can be!<br /><br />What kept me from giving this movie a complete 5 star rating was more a directorial/writing/casting issue. The first thing that bothered me was the time transitions or lack there of. In the beginning of the movie, there was a little blurb that popped up to let everyone know what year it was. The rest of the film is not so kind. I'm not saying every scene needed a little blurb to let me know that time had passed, but there were definitely a few awkward time transitions that confused me. Most movies that are based on true stories will say something like, \\"2 years later\\" or something to help the viewer acclimate to the time change. In this movie, one minute Paige, Sam's daughter, is 5 years old, then she is suddenly in her young teens. This wouldn't be a big deal but I had to rewind it because while everyone else looked the same, there was an older actress playing Paige. I think a little blurb stating that time had passed would have been helpful.<br /><br />Another awkward scene is when Donnie, Sam's best friend, tries to take over his nightly duties as a father. It's sweet that while Sam was over in Africa, Donnie would keep an eye on Lynn and Paige. But there is just this part where Donnie is tellingPaige goodnight, and she asks, \\"Aren't you gonna read me a book?\\" Followed by her saying her dad normally kisses her on the forehead and he can do that if he wanted to. Now this isn't the 5 year old Paige asking this. It is the 13-14 year old Paige asking. I work with middle/high school kids and...I don't know, I just felt that that particular scene was creepy and awkward. Not many kids that age that I know would ask their dad's friend for a kiss on the forehead. That's just my opinion!<br /><br />My last issue is a small one, more like a goof. There is a scene where Sam is at the airport to leave for Africa and Lynn, Paige, and Donnie walk him right up to the departing gate. I think everyone knows that doesn't happen anymore, especially after 9/11.<br /><br />Like I said, these are just minor issues I had. If you plan on buying Machine Gun Preacher, it is due out on dvd and blu-ray on June 5th. When you get your copy, make sure you don't turn the film off right away. While the end credits role, there is some real life photos and footage of the real Sam Childers, his close friends/freedom fights Deng and Marco, etc. For more information on how you can help get involved in the fight against Kony, the evil leader of the LRA, come check out my blog. I have a link on there that will take you to a site so that you can get involved. I am going to end this post with something the real Sam says:<br /><br />\\"For me to sit here and give all kinds of excuses to make it right, I can't do. But what I want to ask everyone out there, everyone that has a child, everyone that has a brother, a sister: if your child or family member was abducted today, if a mad man came in, a terrorist came in, abducted your family member or your child and if I said to you I can bring your child home...does it matter how I bring them home?\\" --Sam Childers<br /><br />Mia at The Muses Circle (Like my review?

1401937519|5.0|A book review should concentrate on the book, not the reviewer, but in this case I think it would be appropriate to say a few things about myself at the outset - things that make me, if not unique, then at least rare among the other reviewers of this book.  First of all, I have been researching and writing about near-death experiences (NDEs) since 1977.  During that time, I have personally interviewed or talked extensively with hundreds of near-death experiencers and have dozens of autobiographical accounts of such persons in my own library.  I have also written a number of books on NDEs and scores of articles on the subject.  In addition, I have had the pleasure, and indeed the privilege, of spending several hours with the author, Anita Moorjani, of the book under review here.  So I think I know something about the subject of NDEs.<br /><br />That said, I am prepared to say that Dying to be Me is perhaps the most compelling, insightful and deeply moving rendering of an NDE I have encountered over the past 35 years.  It is a book that not only tells an incredibly gripping story of an NDE and the healing from a disease that seemed destined to be fatal, but one that also offers a great deal of spiritual and practical wisdom that the author derived from her experience during her otherworldly sojourn.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the sixty of so reviews of this book (though I noticed that they are overwhelmingly of the 5-star variety), but I'm sure many of them must already inform the reader of the book's contents.  I have no need to be redundant on that score here, but for the record, Moorjani, a woman of Indian heritage, grew up in the multi-cultural setting of Hong Kong, eventually contracted cancer, suffered with it for four years and by February, 2006, was taken to a hospital and given no chance to survive the night.  However, when she was on the brink of death, she had an extraordinarily powerful NDE, which she recounts with impressive articulateness, and knewin the moment of her experience that she would be healed.  Indeed, that she would be completely cured.  As in fact she was, to the stupefaction of her oncologists.  (All is this documented in the book.)  Her life has not been the same since.<br /><br />Eventually, her story came to the attention of the well-known author, Wayne Dyer, who was so riveted by Anita's account that he spared no effort to track her down and once he did, he told her that she must write a book about her story and he would see to it that it would get published.  He did and it did and within a month of its publication, it had deservedly become a best seller.<br /><br />What more do I need to say?  Anita Moorjani is the real deal.  Her book is destined to become not only the best seller it already is but a classic among books on NDEs.  It will inspire you, thrill you, bring you comfort and bring you joy.  You will be deeply touched in so many ways by this book.  What are you waiting for?
081297381X|1.0|There are a lot of really good books in the world. This book is not one of them. In fact this book could only be classified as horribly stupid. Had I not been required to read it for a class, I would never have finished it. Most of what the author says is simple common sense dressed up with big words and overly complex explanations. And on the rare occasion he had an idea that wasn't simple common sense, it was something that had no application to real life. And to make matters worse, at times he gives information and/or advice that is just plain wrong. This book was a wonderful and complete waste of not only my time, but the paper it was printed on.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I couldn't get past chapter 5. This book is so poorly written, the heroine (?) so annoying and unbelievable; her male counterpart a weak version of many stories I've read before; the plot so contrived...I wish I could get my 10 bucks back. Now all of this is coming from someone who enjoyed the Twilight books, reads the Sookie Stackhouse books, enjoys picking up a light read at the airport... I am in no way a book snob. I enjoy a good story and don't mind if the story is predictable if somewhat well written or engaging. This sludge is the worst thing I have read in ages. The heroine is so stupid and witless that by the end of Chapter 3, I was like \\"pull it together\\". Which is what she keeps telling herself and is unable to do. By Chapter 5, listening to her inner thoughts was like putting glass shards in my eyeballs. No girl is this stupid, so blind to reality or logic--unless she is a coddled 13 year old--and I know 10 year olds with more of a sense of self and situation. I kept hearing about how erotic the book was but I couldn't care less to even get to those parts. This is awful dribble that doesn't even make Harlequin romance level quality. Do yourselves a favor and don't believe the hype.
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|This movie is very entertaining and I would recommend it. Some really crazy scenes. There is also some funny moments with Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy. The scene about stealing an entire car from a high-rise is worth it alone. Don't miss this one!

B0059XTUB8|5.0|This story focuses on a young man (Eddie Redmayne) as Colin.  Through a series of coincidences, Colin becomes 3rd Assistant Director to The Prince and the Showgirl.  From there his youth and innocences continues to land him in unusual circumstances - namely the brief sparking friendship and romance to Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />Michelle Williams' performance as Marilyn Monroe is amazing, as many point out.  Williams' Monroe is spot on with her hushed breath voice and large batting eyelashes.  This particular Marilyn performance outlines her erradic behavoir and troubled life, but mostly focuses on her duel life style mentality - the child-like free spirit and the overwhelmed mega star blinded in the spotlight.  And in here, the viewers finally feel sympathy for the always changing Monroe.<br /><br />But be assured that this movie is more than that.  The perephial performances are equally notched and carry the story.  We see Kenneth Branagh in wonderful performance as Laurence Olivier; his heavy-handed fist perfected film making is in stark contrast to Monroe's method.  Emma Watson's performance was surprisingly fresh and untethered to her Harry Potter past.<br /><br />The story itself does focus on just a very narrow time period, giving the sense of urgency and fine detail that most biopics avoid.  This film is geunine and designed to give the viewer a sense of the author's original voyage.  In this film, we are Colin.  As the time passes, we both love and adore Marilyn only to have the week come to an abrupt end.  We feel like the days are passing too fast and the opportunity is not being appreciated enough.  In this narrow window of time, we not only see a believable Monroe but experience a believable encounter with such a legendary persona.<br /><br />For those that enjoy the star, her films, biographies, or based on true stories - this is highly recommended.
B002R5QPRI|4.0|This was a really good movie.  Whitney did a great job being this was her first movie role! Kevin Costner was good as well as always.  The movie had a good theme and was well written.  All of the actors in the movie played his/her part well and the characters made sense.
014241722X|2.0|I am a huge Grishom fan and fairly enjoyed \\"Theodore Boone Kid Lawyer\\", though it lacked intensity and believability. My huge peeve is that it didn't produce an ending to the story, it just stopped!!!! I hate books that do this and this one did the very worst job of any book I ever read! I was totally involved in the book by the end, couldn't wait to read the conclusion, and BANG, all over. Not only that but there wasn't book 2 that would complete the story. I definitely will not read any more of the series and be disappointed again.<br /><br />I would have given this book a 3 star rating, but this ending ruined the reading experience!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|i read this book out of curiosity to see what the hype was about. The book itself is okay, I think there is a lot of waste space with really mundane stuff. There are many times when nothing is happening or the narrative itself is pointless since its just stating literally everything she is doing. The way I mainly think of this book is like an introduction to the characters, the way they act, operate, and behave. In a way is a very smart move because you go to the second book wanting to know what will happen and since you already have the introduction done, I think the next two books get to the real point and dont strecth out as much. Now the next two are the ones you want!!!! :)
0374275637|1.0|I've now read about half of this informative book. I find it fascinating and easy to read and would willingly give it four stars for the quality of the insights in the book. I am, however, remarkably disappointed in the quality of the binding (I'm speaking of the hard cover edition). After reading the first thirty pages, the book began to fall apart.  I expected to have this book on my shelf for years, but I'll be lucky if it lasts a year. It's distressing that a book by such a prominent academic would suffer from such poor production values. I'm curious if others have had this problem.

B006M9NJFG|3.0|I bought this as a gift for one of my Grandson's pathfinder kit. We have not tested it out yet so my review will be based solely on first impressions. Any or most comments could be changed after our spring outing. The one thing that will not change is the price (really too expensive compared to the many alternatives). But, I bought it, so I'll not complain. My grandsons (6) are all Bear fans so the look is exciting to them. Functionally, the product seems to be as advertised. The one primary concern I have is for the camp/ cook cup. Aluminum is a great material but I am not fond of it for this type of use. Also, a little skeptical about what's going to happen when the finish hits the fire. We'll see soon.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Paul McCartney lately has a daring musical sense of adventure and this album he recorded with British producer Youth has a brilliance and a lot of surprises from the 66 year old genius.  They called themselves THE FIREMAN and this is their third and best album to date.  From screaming vocals to classic pop to ambient sounds, it is an exhilarating ride that is puzzling in places but is full of McCartney's melodic hooks.  On a lot of tracks, McCartney's voice is recessed and has some echo lending an ethereal feel to the music. Also his voice is almost unrecognizeable on some songs: TRAVELLING LIGHT, NOTHING TOO MUCH...,  IS THIS LOVE?, LIGHT FROM YOUR LIGHTHOUSE don't sound like him at all.<br /><br />On the first track: NOTHING TOO MUCH JUST OUT OF SIGHT, Macca delivers a savage vocal, very bluesy and raw; almost as raucous as HELTER SKELTER. The next track: TWO MAGPIES is my least favourite and arguably the weakest on the album. It sounds lazy, tuneless and somewhat uninspired. Thankfully it is only just over two minutes long.<br /><br />But then we have six songs that I can listen to over and over again: from the anthemmic, joyous SING THE CHANGES to the moody, Leonard Cohen-esque TRAVELLING LIGHT which sounds like it is sung by an old, world-wise, weary man and that is not a criticism by any means. Then comes the rocking HIGHWAY with its infectious chorus and wonderful multi-tracked coda. Next is the simple but very likeable LIGHT FROM YOUR LIGHTHOUSE, which for all its simplicity, has an almost demonic harmony vocal in the verse. Another immediately catchy song is SUN IS SHINING which is all sunshine and joy with a wonderful opening depicting the sunrise and a very catchy na-na-na refrain. Then Macca and Youth do a Phil Spector wall of sound production on DANCE TILL WE'RE HIGH, which has a very seasonal, Christmas feel to it. This could have been a great Christmas song if the lyrics were different.<br /><br />The last five tracks are the ambient, new-age phase ofthe album. Very experimental with Paul exploring new effects and musical collages. Maybe some of it is too repetitive (as in LOVERS IN A DREAM) but it is definitely hypnotic and when I am in the right mood, it is a half-hour of total relaxation and mind travel. Not all of it is soft and ethereal as UNIVERSAL HERE, EVERLASTING NOW has a hi-energy sound.<br /><br />A couple of slight complaints:<br /><br />1. The last track DON'T STOP RUNNING, which is one of the best on the album has a playing time of 10:30 minutes. But the track is basically over after six minutes. Then there is a very long two minutes of silence before some synthesizer effects play out the last two minutes. If only an extra track could have been included to take up the last four minutes of the album...<br /><br />2. There is a large booklet that comes with the cd. i was hoping to find out more about the collaboration between Youth and McCartney as well as notes on the making of the album.  But instead the pages are full of McCartney working on his ho-hum paintings and the final works.<br /><br />But I loved the adventure that this album provides and for a guy who was 66 years old when he recorded the album, I still have the strongest admiration and appreciation for Sir Paul.
B005SNP6FS|5.0|Colin Farrel is superb in one of the best movies I have seen this year and have never heard of!<br /><br />This movie has good action, acting and is totally unpredictable, which is rare in movies today.  Also the soundtrack is fantastic, good classic and emo/brit pop.  I would say this is a must see for any Pulp Fiction or overall action movie fan.
B000N3T0DW|3.0|This has nothing to do with the movie itself but with the DVD and Amazon's description of it that claims it has closed-captioning.  No, it does not, it has English subtitles only, no Spanish ones (which, for a Spanish-language movie, that's what closed-captioning would be: Spanish subtitles since closed-captioning is done for the hearing impaired).<br /><br />I was going to use this to learn Spanish.  Nope.  I wasted my money because of an inaccurate description.
B005H29GSI|3.0|Fairly entertaining, but can be a little frustrating too.  We added Mulligans to our game play... you get three re-shoots per game.  Might have to be higher though - it's hard to be consistent with that little slingshot!!  Setting them up is fun though, and it's VERY satisfying once you're finally able to get the knack for knocking those suckers off their little perches ;)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie the other day and was intrigued enough by the concept to want to read the book. It is a great premise for a dystopian novel. I think I enjoyed the concept much more than the actual book--and I give credit to the author for coming up with a such a unique and creative story. The \\"reaping\\" reminded me of the haunting classic short story by Shirley Jackson \\"The Lottery\\" and I was impressed to see how Collins expanded this concept and put such a fascinating twist to it. When reading a dystopian novel, one does have to extend their beliefs a bit -- satires like this are meant to magnify the darkest aspects of human nature and so I had no difficulty in accepting the premise of the storyline.<br />Children from the most repressed societies selected at random to fight to the death for the entertainment of the upper-classes. Here in America, where we send our poor and repressed to war to fight for us and where our entertainment largely comes from reality TV, it does not seem so far-fetched! But the plot isn't even that simple, the politics of the battle go beyond strategy and survival in the ring--participants (or Tributes) are further humiliated by having to secure sponsorships, which greatly increase their chances of survival, by trying to win the favor of the very people that put them there to suffer.<br /><br />While reading the book itself, I enjoyed it and was surprised to see that the movie remained largely true to the story. However, I was disappointed with the character development. I did not feel connected to any of them really--and often felt confused by them and their motives. I think this is what failed to make it a great story! There was so much I would have liked to have known about Peeta, about Haymitch, the other tributes, even Katniss the main character herself seemed to fall short in character development--and I got the feeling that the author meant to write this book as a vehicle to deliver a message rather than write a story.<br /><br />Even with the shortcomings, I am hooked and cannot wait to read the following books. I get the feeling that a love triangle is developing and wonder if this series will take the place of Twilight in winning over the young adult masses with Gale versus Peeta camps starting up. But then I haven't read the sequels yet either to know where the author intends to go next.
B00756GKBA|2.0|alot of hot air and breathing and not much memorable. Madonna is still a young Woman, though not Young enough anymore to be sounding like she is trying to compete with Katy Perry or her new rival Lady Gaga. now Madonna has her track record and has made her mark and she did it better than most  30 years back,  however alot of this album wants to recapture something that is long ago gone.  it is like part a trip back down memory lane, except Madonna here comes across and sounds Moody, heartbroken and just bitter and sadly her best material for those type of situations are the smooth out songs.<br /><br />much like say \\"this use to be my playground\\", live to tell or  take a bow.  less direct is one of her best musical strengths, sadly alot of the material on here feels forced and contrived and she hasn't made a musical statement to me in years and even sadder is that not one of these tracks to me is a Money track. Madonna has what i call some cool ideas for outtakes and b sides, however nothing here really cooks and it sounded better 20 years ago when it was called \\"Erotica\\"

0670022705|5.0|This is an enchanting read---I was initially intrigued by the idea that the original BBC Radio broadcast (consisting of spoken word only) was incapable of presenting visuals of the 100 Objects. The audio version of this book is a bit like listening to a vivid description of what might be behind a black curtain. Your mind's eye is teased to fill in the forms described. Of course, this book rectifies the lack of visuals in the broadcast version with excellent photo illustrations (and the British Museum web site offers abundant additional resource materials). I find myself wishing that every Art Museum would attempt a similar project with objects from their collection. What endless hours I would spend immersing myself in the peripheral histories surrounding these objects, and not just delighting in their physical forms.

B005XBA9Y8|4.0|I wasn't planning to buy this when I first saw the price but when I calculated the individual CD amount I had to jump on it.<br />It definitely is a 'boxed' set. The box lid flips open for display from the front and the CDs are easily accessed. It also includes a booklet describing the company's history and some of their historic recording milestones.<br />The CD's are housed in cardboard sleeves and are one of two of my only complaints. Mainly that they are quite(!) difficult to remove from the sleeve. If you are frequently needing to listen to them my suggestion would be to place them in a separate case or soft sleeve of their own (cardboard sleeves have a tendency to scratch easily).<br />The album variety is nice but (which is my second complaint) lacks more of the commonly known names and their works such as Handel, Telemann, etc. If you're more of the lover of very dramatic or modern works/composers such as Copeland then this is the set for you.<br />If you are a fan of Mercury Living Presence albums such as I am and wish to fill out your collection with albums you previously avoided due to the price then this is a great way to go. I'm hoping that additional sets are on the way.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am cheap and didn't want to give into the hype.  But I did and paid for the book.  I'm left wondering how this will play in a movie.  I'm a \\"I have to read it first\\" before sitting watching a story play on the big screen.  Thank god for that.  There is no way what I just finished reading will capture me on a big screen.<br /><br />The storyline, Mr. Grey and Ana are captivating.  I'm still in shock that I've read a book like this.  But I'm ready to move on to book 2.  *blushes and covers my face*  My subconscious and inner goddess were perched on my shoulders with anticipation the entire read.  When I wasn't reading, my mind was still in a tailspin.  All the playroom drama didn't do a thing for me, but the emotions and inner struggles were excellent.<br /><br />On to reading my next \\"darker\\" $9.99 + tax  paid book.  Better than spending $13 to see it on a big screen.

0385534639|1.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me and we pretty much have the same taste in books, she said it was really good and so I bought the book thinking this has got to be a good one.  Unfortunately, for me, it was not at all good.  I found it at most boring and I never once felt anything towards any of the characters.  Sure descriptions of the circus (sights, smells, atmosphere, etc.) were nice but the characters and the story lacked. I'm really bummed I spent money on this book, I also recommended the book to my mom before I had read it and she felt the same as I did.  I learned my lesson on that one, I will only recommend books I have read and like.  This one was a dud for me, I won't ever recommend it to anyone else.  I don't see what all the hype is about and what people love about this book.

0307593312|4.0|Japan's Haruki Murakami writes a surreal novel for the intellectual reader with a touch of fantasy. This is not a completely lucid story, nor byzantine, so I would say it's semiabstract. Haruki may be the leader of a new genre. It's almost like he didn't write the novel for the hoi polloi, but for the artsy reader. Not that I'm a artsy reader! The story is basically strong, but leaves a lot of unanswered questions in the book's last 25 pages, after already reading 900 previously. I was a little disappointed with that scenario, since I became very interested in many of the characters and wanted closure one way or the other. Maybe I'm wrong and there will be a second book to answer my linguistic inquiries. But overall, I found the novel uniquely absorbing with strong character development.<br /><br />The story is set in Japan, mostly in the Tokyo area during the year 1984. Our heroine, Aomame ( Ah-oh-mah-meh ), who has the strange vocation of a sport's trainer and as a part time assassin is dropped off by a taxi on a traffic jammed expressway. She climbs down the elevated expressway via a strange stairway to a lower level. Once on the ground, her world is about to change. On her way to a assassination, she notices slight differences in policemen's uniforms and pistols. Later Aomame notices that she missed news events and the big one: Our moon suddenly has a companion! It's a smaller green moon! She realizes that she has entered a somewhat altered world. Our heroine calls it 1Q84 ( the Q for question ).<br /><br />Our hero in the novel is Tengo Kawana, a teacher and a nascent author, who as a ten year old went to school with Aomame. He rewrites a novel for a mysterious seventeen year old named Fuka-Eri. The book Air Chrysalis becomes a bestseller, but causes major problems with the religious group Sakigake. The group hires a Mr. Ushikawa ( a vile, but enjoyable character ) to dissuade Tengo from further involvement in the book. He refuses and this sets off a strife between Sakigake, Tengo and Fuka-Eri. Aomame gets enveloped in this trouble with Sakigake via a assignment from a arcane dowager and her bodyguard Mr. Tamaru. How all this comes together is a monumental accomplishment by the author. Other characters worth mentioning are Leader, Buzzcut, Ponytail and Professor Ebisuno. Character creation seems to be a strong suit of Haruki Murakami. I can't remember when I liked so many characters in a novel, I would probably have to go back to Charles Dickens's 'David Copperfield' !<br /><br />So as you can tell, I liked the novel a lot, but was also disappointed with the closure of some of the characters. Do I think this novel deserves a exsibilation or a standing ovation? I think somewhere in between is the best answer. I'm taking in to consideration that this book was translated from Japanese to English by Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel, who I'm sure did a yeoman's job. Also a big factor is that in Japan this book was a trilogy. I think if you are a literary geek, you must read at least one Haruki Murakami novel and this one is a good option!ween Sakigake, Tengo and Fuka-Eri.

B005LAJ22Q|1.0|The first season of Walking Dead was pretty good - the pilot was brilliant and the following four episodes or so were really good. The last two episodes (the last one, especially) were pretty bad, but I figured that was a one-off and was eagerly anticipating season two.<br /><br />WOW. What the hell happened? This show, in season 2, became everything that a bad show can be. It was poorly written, with bad, unlikeable characters saying annoying and idiotic things to each other. The situations were contrived and a waste of time to watch. It was illogical - look, obviously a zombie show can't be \\"realistic\\", but it needs a consistent set of rules. Zombies need to operate the same throughout. They can operate any way you want, but they need to be consistent (for example, 28 Days Later has zombies that don't act the way they do in, say, Dawn of the Dead, but it makes sense throughout and is a fine movie). The Walking Dead writers constantly broke the rules to fit their own terrible narratives.<br /><br />I've heard people say that this is not a \\"zombie show\\", in that it's more about how people operate when the society they've known their whole lives falls apart. Fine. But it's HORRIBLE at that! The characters don't act like people, they don't say things people would say. They aren't even likeable. You don't need zombie attacks every minute, but you need something. This show has nothing.<br /><br />Perhaps worst of all - it is BORING. This was not, I repeat, not, a fun show to watch. Season 2 was so stupefyingly boring I couldn't believe it. The pace was so out of wack, it just doesn't seem like something that seasoned veterans of TV and movies could put out. How can you make a zombie apocalypse entertainment product boring? Watch this season and find out.<br /><br />This might be the most disappointing show I've ever seen. I mean this. It started with such potential and turned out so, so, bad. It's not even a little bit good. It's just awful. My recommendation is to juststay away from this season. If you need a zombie fix, find some movies to watch or play some Dead Rising (I think Dead Rising 2 is underrated). Anything but this.
B007MDB71O|5.0|As a lifetime Edgar Rice Burroughs fan I was thrilled when it was announced that the film JOHN CARTER was going into production.  I read this series of books when I was a child and dreamed of Barsoom and what it must look like.  Well Walt Disney Pictures and Andrew Stanton have made my childhood dreams come true.  JOHN CARTER is all I could hope it to be.  An excellent movie version of a classic book.  This film is beautiful to look at with excellent effects and characters.  Many critics have been very hard on this film but I feel most of them never saw it and just mailed the reviews in. For those of you who truly enjoy movies grab some popcorn and sit down and enjoy a truly great fantasy adventure.  \\"JOHN CARTER RULES\\" and this is what movies are all about!  The new blu ray is beautiful and for those of you who missed this in the theaters here's your chance to enjoy this great movie at home.  Check it out!

0307888908|4.0|I knew I was going to like this book as soon as I read Hoffman's account of problems currently taking place with the usual career growth path.  He described all of us on a series of escalators each going up levels of promotions and pay. The basic message was they were clogged with people and in some cases, not moving up.  In other words, if it comes to your career or are looking for a job, you can no longer count on most of the tried and true things that would get you ahead professionally.  You have to treat your career as if you are in a constant state of starting up a business.  You have to be constantly on the prowl for the next growth opportunity.  Obviously as a networking guy (co-founded Linked In) he gave great examples of just how important your relationships are to your career.  I think this is a great book to read to help adjust your thinking about how to self manage your career and would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for career growth.
B000002IRL|5.0|Horrorscope is an essential from Overkill and one of the best metal albums ever. Production's good, great guitar solos, drumming and songwriting. It's a bit darker and heavier than their early stuff. The songs are generally slower paced but there's some fast ones and they go for a more mature direction. Doom metal was introduced into their music even though it's still close to their early thrash roots, they don't really change their sound until I Hear Black. There's a lot of down-tuned guitar which gives it a very heavy sound. Horrorscope is easily their best album to date, at least right next to The Years Of decay and Ironbound. Early '90s was one of the best eras of metal.
B006Z21ZEM|3.0|If this were the first or second live release from Maiden I'd give it 5 stars. But this is like the 5th or 6th DVD and 10th live CD so why bother? Maiden is a great band live but if you own all the others.....or even the last one and one 10 years earlier you don't need this one!!! I'm sure the morons will be pissed I'm slagging their almighty band but this is just a cheap way for an established band to turn a fast buck off morons. When they do a live DVD of JUST new material or a series where they perform 2 albums in sequence live like \\"Number Of The Beast + Somewhere In Time\\" or maybe the last 2 studio releases back-to-back as Styx did I'll be impressed. At this point this is just another disposable unnecessary live DVD and CD to make a buck!

B0073XORCY|1.0|At this stage there is an unofficial rift between Anderson and Barre and this seems to be Anderson's attempt to prove to the public and Barre he doesn't need Barre and is solely Jethro Tull. It proves quite the opposite! Anderson solo has never been a fav of mine aside from his \\"Walk Into Light\\" and that's only because Peter John-Vetesse carried that one. To be fair with Barre gearing up his own touring band consisting of past Tull members playing Tull classics I expect that will be better but also missing something without Anderson.<br /><br />Thank God I downloaded this free! May buy it when I can get it used for $5.00 (including shipping), might have bought it had the opening price been $8.99 with my Amazon Prime shipping but for $17.99 NO WAY! Most sequels.....especially of iconic albums 20,30+ years after the fact fail. Queensryche Mindcrime II for example was hideous....than with the absence of key writer Chris DeGarmo it couldn't be anything but a disaster. Usually a pathetic grab at jump starting a CD by riding on folk lore and myth. Anderson here plays his cards well stacking the deck in his favor by releasing it under \\"Ian Anderson\\" he can claim it isn't meant to sound like \\"Jethro Tull\\" deflecting musical comparison yet he's doing a sequel to a staple Jethro Tull album therefore it SHOULD BE COMPARED and Anderson justifies releasing it as a solo CD claiming he wrote all of the original. Unfortunately Anderson without Barre's contribution as a writer/player leaves this CD inflated and light sounding. Sure, the 29 year old kid playing guitar does a fine job copying Barre's licks and sound BUT under Anderson's control. The music is mainly acoustic/flute/Hammond B3 driven. On a plus side, Anderson's voice is in fine form here.<br /><br />I would equate the sacrilege (on a smaller scale here though same principle) to Paul McCartney assembling 3-4 young musicians including Lennon and Harrison vocal clones and doing a sequel to Sgt. Pepper without even including sole surviving member Ringo. This is a thinly disguised power-play by Anderson to produce a \\"Jethro Tull\\" CD minus Martin Barre while being able to fall back on the excuse of it being a solo release if/when it falls short. I wish Martin Barre success in his venture and hope Ian Anderson gets what he deserves.<br /><br />This is a missed opportunity as with Barre, as a Jethro Tull release without the cheap, sleazy attempt to capitalize on a past win with the added balls Barre brings to the writing this COULD'VE BEEN a nice NEW addition to the Tull catalog and perhaps mended the rift between Anderson and Barre. Instead this leaves us with a crappy CD and assures that we will see no future Tull releases with Barre. Anderson's attempt to prove his ego just marked the end of a great band. Great job Ian!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Sometimes a book is unavoidable.  First, my Grandson was in need of a credit in HS and was given the option of reading the trilogy and then doing a separate project for each one. He highly recommended the books to me, then the movie hype, so I figured I may as well read the book.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins, who has had some success as a writer for children's television has created an interesting dystopian society where the country is broken into 12 Districts of various resources, but all poor and citizens struggle to feed their families.<br /><br />Each year, the Capital, where wealth and luxury abound, holds a drawing from all of the 12 to 18 year-olds, selecting one boy and one girl from each District, to compete, to the death, in the Hunger Games.  That's a rather simplified description of a somewhat complex process.  The winner receives recognition for their District and a much more comfortable life for themselves and their family.<br /><br />The author does a nice job of fleshing out characters, imbuing both the main and secondary ones with enough attributes and personality to make them interesting in their own right.<br /><br />I chose to give the book four stars.  It's not one of the best I've ever read, and in its category as a YA novel(which would include all the Harry Potter works) it's not quite to that level. However, I liked it well enough and any book that gets children reading deserves serious props.  [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]]

B00756GKBA|4.0|As the diehard Madonna fan I am, when I first heard \\"Give me all your luvin'\\" I panicked. Specially in these times when so many other wannabe divas are fighting to push M out of her throne (with one of them alarmingly close to make it). It sounded so immature, so not Madonna (at least not the Madonna I loved the most, the one from the late 80s and 90s). I was angry that she was trying to please the teenagers instead of her true fans (who are mostly in their early 30s). I must admit, I ranted about my disappointment for a while, expecting the worst...and then I saw the Super Bowl halftime show and it all fell into place. She had been planning this all along! (why the hell was I surprised? who knows). After hearing and seeing the video for Girl Gone Wild, I recomposed my faith in M and was ready to let her take me on a wild ride. MDNA has been a lot more than what I expected. Of course, I you honestly hate house and techno music then this album was not made with you in mind. My favorite songs are in order of importance: \\"Lovespent\\" (it is such a collection of eclectic sounds, and the lyrics are a mixture of sadness and anger that make it very attractive, I love that it feels asymmetric, the sound of the banjo adds something unique), \\"Gang Bang\\" (this one feels different to what she has done before though I could see certain resemblance to \\"Die another day\\", it is violent and fun, the ending is just EPIC...perfect to perform live), \\"Some Girls\\" (the alarm like sounds of the beginning and the autotune are used masterfully and make a great dance track), \\"Girl gone wild\\" (FUN...that is the word to describe it), I don't give A (this is the most \\"urban\\" yet danceable track, I really like that she decided to collaborate with Minaj), \\"Masterpiece\\" (for those who like a more classic Madonna track), \\"Falling Free\\" (it is haunting, again the sadness of her recent divorce surfaces and it is touching). \\"Turn up the radio\\" deserves a special mention because I think is the most cleverly commercial of the set, and the one that will likely move the album up in the charts. Even the weakest songs let themselves be heard, though I would not care if she had left out GMAYL or B'day. Madonna is back and ready to impress again!!!erly commercial of the set, and the one that will likely move the album up in the charts.

Also, it has mostly side dishes which is not quite suitable for people like me who looking for recipes for everyday main meal.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was told a few weeks ago that I should read this omnibus, but put it off because I was \\"busy\\". Then again a week ago, my brilliant and doesn't-recommend-books-often sister TOLD ME to read it. Boy, am I glad I listened to her. I breezed through the first few volumes in one sitting, then realized it was after midnight and I needed to get up in the morning. I put down my Kindle, rather grudgingly, and slept fitfully. It took another two days to be able to pick it up again, and all the while my head was spinning with what-ifs and the constant nagging in the back of my head to dropeverythingandgoreadthebookbecauseitwilldrivemecrazyifIdon't. Last night, I was finally able to relax and read again, and of course I couldn't - wouldn't - put it down again. At 3:10 in the morning, I finished the epilogue of book 5 and couldn't sleep AGAIN because I was too busy being dumbfounded and repeating \\"Wow. Oh wow.\\" like a completely bedazzled fool.<br /><br />That reaction is not a common one when I read books, especially a series. Rare is it that a book can capture my attention and force me to stay up past my self-imposed bedtime (I value my sleep). Rarer still that I will have dreams and lingering curiosity about what happens next. I want to crawl into Hugh's head and run up and down the staircases in his mind, watching the next however-many years play out. Wool is thrilling, yet familiar. Disturbing, yet heartwarming. It is a book that evokes such a wide range of emotion and facial expressions that I'm sure if you were to video tape a cross section of the populace, you would capture a full spectrum of the usage of facial musculature.<br /><br />If you have not read Wool, prepare yourself for a long sit-down. Don't expect to be able to casually read a single chapter and put it down over the course of several days. And then commit to it, because this whole series will change you and change you for the better. You will miss out if you deny yourself this experience.
B007DIQB50|3.0|A small dose of rap, an overdose of pop.  That being said, 95% of these songs are quite addictive and I foresee the majority of them peaking within the Top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.  Nicki possesses some very decent emceeing skills and the too-short rap portion of 'Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded' left me craving more of that.  Once \\"Starships\\" comes along though, the album takes a turn to pop of the extremely sweet and bubbly sort.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just slightly disappointing for the hip-hop fan.<br /><br />This album is not going to help or hinder Nicki Minaj in any way; I think it's very fun (it has \\"summer\\" written all over it), but ultimately forgettable, unfortunately.  I could be wrong though - if many of the tracks this album has to offer end up blowing up on the charts, she could have a monstrous hit on her hands.<br /><br />Be aware of what you're getting yourself into before you buy it.  If you're coming for hip-hop, I'd suggest looking elsewhere first.  90% of 'Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded' is radio-friendly pop.  Very upbeat and it will undoubtedly lift your spirits, but it sounds identical to everything else that all \\"hit music\\" radio statins are spinning right now.  Nothing new or different.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I'm a baby boomer who has loved Paul McCartney since way back to the 60s.  I just think this CD is wonderful.  I keep playing it over and over.  They're very old songs that he sings with such sweet tenderness.  I found it endearing.  This is a rock star that is growing older with charm and grace.  I'm ordering 3 more to give to people that I love.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I only read this book after so many of my friends said so many good things about it. Once you have gotten over the fact that it is in fact written after the author had read \\"Twilight\\" and this is actually a Twilight fan fiction novel, you understand where the author came from.  It's an easy read. This is not a novel to be read to get anything out of it. It's what I call \\"brainless reading.\\" You don't need an imagination for this book, it doesn't require you to think about anything.<br />As far as it being \\"erotica\\", I've read the Sleeping Beauty trilogy by Anne Rice. It doesn't hold a candle to it.  If you are looking for a book to pass the time, it's not horrible.
1400064287|4.0|Big fan of books like Freakonomics and anything by Malcolm Gladwell, and this is inline with those reads. It gets you to think about how to be efficient and why certain ideas stick while others are forgotten. Great if you're into marketing.
B000FC2PKG|2.0|I kept hoping this book would get better and have a point, but that never happened. Bobby Dodge was a good character, but the book kept getting more & more unreal to me.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Enough said! l needed this cuz its actually quicker to download vids than to even attempt to watch a full video on my YouTube app..... love it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I suppose its not even necessary to review this particular book. Seems that everyone loves it, and not the movie is out. Perhaps I should wait and see the movie and critique it instead as the movie can rarely hold a candle to the book. I liked the book, read it in two sittings, and understand why it has and continues to sale like hotcakes, as they say. Join the masses, read the book, and, except for my mother-in-law who refuses to read it based on it's premise (children forced to kill other children in a game), I believe all who read it (even my mother-in-law if she would venture it), will be satisfied.

055380684X|5.0|\\"I'm not world class because I wasn't born with the right genes.\\"  This book convincingly suggests that the difference more often is hard work, good teaching, movtiation, persistence, and occasionally circumstance.  It's well written, and has practical suggestions about proper deep practice to enhance skill development.
0439023521|5.0|Went thru this book in two days.  Gripping!  Book appeals to audiences over 13, but anyone of any age after that.  I'm 29, and loved this entire trilogy!  Great stories.  I wish the author would write more!!  I'm hooked!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|A friend had mentioned this series as a hot and must read, and at first I hesitated. BDSM is not my forte. After reading reviews and hearing the overwhelming word of mouth, I caved and began reading the first book. The entire series was deliciously devoured within two days. While this story has an addition and a main reference to BDSM, the real wits and manner are within the characters. It is very character driven, and heartbreakingly sad, sexy, tumultuous and brutally raw.<br /><br />Ana, the main character is a shy girl who is innocent and still daring and very curious at the same time. She has yet to breakthrough and come into her own until she meets an elusive man. Enter the Dom-Christian Grey. A man who is just that--a man, and remains locked, guarded and emotionally an adolescent. He is sex on legs, master of the universe and is immediately tempted and captivated by Ana--who contradicts her own actions as she defies and also submits.<br /><br />The story is fascinating and utterly erotic once the plot is established, which is early. Ms James is casual and nonchalant in introducing a lifestyle to those who are not used to, nor comfortable with--she reels you in and makes you interested. What is this? Why do you do this? Instantly catapulted to feel and be like Ana-voyeuristic and ready to be educated. Not to say that the lifestyle is romanticized, however she makes it understandable and incorporates both 'kinky' and what is considered `normal' in a perfect marriage for these two characters. While there are several repetitive statements, they are only ticklers in being empathic with the enormity of the emotions, plots, and all characters for all that is involved. Which is mighty heavy and fifty shades of dark wrapped in an alluring sardonic bow.<br /><br />Loved this series and am more than excited to begin following Ms James on her latest writing endeavors.
B0060MYLJS|3.0|I love this show, but it is seriously time for it to end. Season 5 of \\"Californication\\" had its moments, but they were few and far between. Also, the final scene of the season ticked me off more than any episode ever has before (which is saying a lot). It's just like, seriously? What other ridiculous crap is going to happen to these poor people? Can't Hank and Karen enjoy a mere five minutes of happiness? Apparently not, because then I guess the producers figure then there'd be no show. UGH. It's so frustrating.<br /><br />Prior to the season finale, I probably would have been generous and given this season a whopping four starts. There are some episodes that are much better than others, but I had many more laughs this season than I did in several seasons past. The major storylines of the season are as follows:<br /><br />* Hank and Karen aren't together (obviously). In fact, Karen is married to another guy that fans will recognize from a past season of the show, and that character's antics are some of the best moments all season.<br /><br />* Hank is screenwriting again, this time for a gangsta rapper/wannabe movie star (and violent, crazy you-know-what) named, ahem, SAMURAI APOCALYPSE. Just watch.<br /><br />* Becca is head over heels in love with a total jerk-off named Tyler. Karen thinks all is well and good but Hank can't stand the little punk (shocking, I'm sure).<br /><br />* Marci is married to Stu after all, and she named her and Charlie's baby Stuart (ew!).<br /><br />* Charlie steals the show this season, as usual...there is one especially hilarious moment that involves him in the backseat of Samurai's car. Best moment of the season by far.<br /><br />* Another scene-stealer is Drea de Matteo, who guest stars in one episode and is an absolute riot. I wish she'd stuck around a bit longer.<br /><br />So those are the highlights. If you've seen the other seasons of this show, you can pretty much fill in all the gaps. Hank is still sleeping with everything that moves. His constant shenanigans exasperate Karen and Becca. Becca struggles with loving her dad and being totally fed up with him. Charlie makes an ass of himself numerous times over. Near the end, you think Hank and Karen may finally have a chance together, but then a stupid, STUPID turn of events totally ruins everything at the end. Gee, what will happen next season? Will Karen be upset at Hank? Will it tear them apart for the 763,934 time? I wonder </sarcasm>.<br /><br />Seriously, Showtime, come up with something more original for these characters, or let Season 6 be the final curtain.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not sure how to review this without giving too much away, but lets see. The main character Ana is pretty much an older Bella and Christian is her Edward. He presents her with a proposition like none she has ever seen and instead of making the decision she seems to have rationalized she spends the entire book enamoured with him to the point that she loses herself in him. So it is back and forth back and forth the whole book. If you like the lady p*rn then this book has it, and that is pretty much all it has. I skipped over the middle pages because they were so redundant and to be honest it didn't make a difference. The ending leaves things open to a sequel which i know is out there and I could care less about reading.<br /><br />I felt no connection to either of these characters except maybe Ana in the beginning but that faded eventually. And just when I thought I would resepct her again.. POOF.. she does something to make me roll my eyes again.<br /><br />Sad I bought and didn't wait until it was at my library.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Some people are bound to dislike this book because parenting styles can be a very touchy subject. Many people take it as a personal affront when someone advocates or uses a different method or disagrees with them. As mothers we tend to over react. This book doesn't criticize any method of parenting used by American parents, but tells us her experiences raising her children in France and her integration and embracing of many components of French parenting.<br /><br />The book is fascinating reading and I found that though I am an American, I could see the reason and the logic behind the French philosophy, a philosophy that the whole culture seems to embrace almost to a person. The idea that children need to experience controlled frustration so they learn to manage it, that they need time to be alone to know themselves and to learn to be alone comfortably, the idea of the \\"cadre\\" the structured framework of expectations and rules of the family that allow children freedom and leeway inside the boundaries set makes excellent sense.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It is accurate, and it works incredibly well. The only problem is the time is a bit off and I don't know how to change it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is ultimately an app for all ages  some of these games are extremely hard and frusturating. This is now my favorite game.
B0028R3NCU|1.0|This failed in less than a year, despite very little apparent wear on the outside, and only light use.  Downgrading to 1 star, from original 3 stars.  Original review: Very small, and works reliably, but gets hot to the touch during use.  I don't know why, since my other microSDHC USB adapter, which is a large plastic one, does not do this (with my other one, the card and adapter both remain cool).
B0053OB6V0|5.0|This is an excellent film.  The cinematography and the setting is quite beautiful.  The theme song is unforgettable.  The actors all did a wonderful job.

B004EPZ03E|4.0|Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor all become marooned on a desert island when another of Alvin's wild schemes goes awry, this time while on a vacation cruise to an international music awards show overseas. In an attempt to rescue them, Dave soon gets stranded too, and even evil \\"Uncle\\" Ian is along for the adventure. Meanwhile, the `munks are not in the best of hands, as they have fallen into a friendship of sorts with another castaway, a woman named Zoe who is clearly not all there and definitely not concerned with anyone's safety.<br /><br />This third installment in the Chipmunks' bigscreen/live-action franchise was yet another huge hit, and that probably means those of us who enjoy the Chipmunks can look forward to another film down the pipeline (hopefully keeping Jason Lee and keeping to the bigscreen. However, this one has been hit pretty hard in the reviews department. People generally didn't like it and consider it a cheap, contrived cash grab. But, ya know what? A LOT of those people seem to say that about any live-action film with CGI cartoon stars, even without ever seeing the movie. It's a kinda prejudice that exists these days against certain kinds of movies, especially ones with the younger audience as priority. Yes, they are all cash grabs; that doesn't mean they can't be good films. And, you've also got tons of people out there who could never find this sort of thing entertaining because their brains are too \\"old\\". They see this as just a movie to take their kids to, and something they have to suffer through. They would never ALLOW themselves to enjoy it. So, all I'm saying is, be careful whose advice you take about ANY movie's worth. See it yourself, and if you know you're not going to like it because it is a Chipmunks movie or a live-action cartoon, or whatever else, before you even see the film, then even if you do see it, you might as well keep your opinion to yourself. Just because they are not your genre does not mean they are all garbage.<br /><br />So, speaking to those who were open minded about the first film (which was a very good film, and any negatives I've heard on it came from people like I've described above or that breed of fan who thinks the 80's version of the Chipmunks IS and SHOULD ALWAYS BE the only way they are ever done), longtime Chipmunk fans like myself or not, this movie is NOT as bad as everyone has said. It's not as good as the first one, but I'd say it is as good as the second, and at least we don't get a replacement Dave here for the bulk of the film. Now, this film IS more pandering to the kid audience, as the second one was (this one might be worse in that department), and there are a few cringe-worthy moments of over-the-top silliness, like with the second film, which usually has to do with how some humans interact with the chipmunks. In this film, I was not crazy about the skanky club-girl dance off the Chipettes had early on. And, no doubt, a lot of people probably found the Zoe character a bit annoying. I think that she was supposed to be a little bit, but comedic personalities like her are often annoying to many people. She was still pretty funny. And the main characters, Dave, the Chipmunks, the Chipettes, and Ian were back in perfect form. If you're someone who watches this movie more for the Chipmunks than anything else, I'd take a guess that they get most of the screen time this go-round. But, like I said, we thankfully see a lot more of Dave, which the second film lacked.<br /><br />Anyway, as for the story, yeah, it's pretty simple, and of course it's contrived. That's the nature of cartoon character stories, especially those largely rooted in the world of television. The entertainment comes from the characters, how they handle things, how they interact with others, etc... It's about personalities, and these characters are the same as they ever were. Not surprising, since the same folks who created the 80's TV series are strong forces behind these newer films (so, don't give me the \\"it's nothing like the 80's Chipmunks\\" routine, your hindsight is rose-colored). But, as usual, there are lessons to be learned here all around, and they are well done. It's a film about learning to be responsible when necessary, and parents learning to trust their kids when necessary (and that they've managed to teach them a thing or two), and even about learning to forgive and be a better person. Yeah, those are just a few lessons you can pull from this film, but it IS well done.<br /><br />And, oh, did you know there's music in this too? Yeah, the Chipmunks sing a lot in this. Though, I think for some people this was still a weak point since the songs are mostly current (or recent), and not everyone keeps up with that stuff. I've heard some folks say they only recognized the first song in the film (\\"Vacation\\"), but I am sure that's not really true. Surely they recognize the Lady Gaga songs too, at the very least. Anyway, this was not a big issue for me, but I suppose a lot of the oldschool fans would like to see a few more oldschool tunes in any future installments.<br /><br />\\"Alvin and the Chipmunks - Chipwrecked\\" is technically consistent with the 2 previous films. The visuals are highest quality, the characters are the same as we remember, and the story may be contrived for some, but as a chipmunks story it is fitting enough and makes way for the personality-driven entertainment, as a good, comedic cartoon plot should. Many will complain about the pop culture humor, especially the kind that panders to the youngest or that which some folks find tacky, but the Chipmunks are the very definition of pop-culture exploitation, let's face it. It's what they do. If you don't like it, watch something else. For the few moments of jokes that might leave older viewers clueless, most of the rest of the film is pretty universally understandable and entertaining, especially if you have been a fan of these characters for a looong time. Bottom-line, this is a fine Chipmunks movie. It's not as good as the first in this series, but that one focused the most on entertaining the oldschool fans. The sequels, yes, HAVE pandered more to the younger set (though at least they brought in the Chipmunks for us), but there is still plenty of fun and funny here, as well as consistency with the previous two films, that anyone who liked the other two should be able to enjoy this one too. It may be your least favorite, maybe not, but it's worthwhile if the Chipmunks are your thing, and if that isn't ONLY the 80's Chipmunks. Hey, I grew up with them too, I just think a lot of my fellow fans have that version on a pedestal. I think that's more the fault of the 80's bigscreen feature than the actual TV show, ha. Anyway, I do recommend this to those who saw the previous two. If you didn't, then why are you even here?<br /><br />Now, a word about the Blu-Ray release. This Blu-Ray comes with a DVD and a digital copy. I don't use digital copies, so I won't talk about that. I think the DVD's are a nice inclusion, though if I'm paying more to get it, I'd rather just have the Blu-Ray and keep the price down. Anyway, there is a nice selection of behind the scenes featurettes here that talk a lot about the Chipmunks, the Bagdasarians (the family behind the Chipmunks), the film, and everything else. There is unfortunately no commentary, but we do get extended scenes and a lot of options for singing and dancing along to the songs. The trailers are also included, as well as a short Scrat cartoon (from \\"Ice Age\\") and a trailer for \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", which you may be glad to know if you, like me, consider Lily Collins (Phil's daughter) to be an absolute goddess (even if the movie and her enhanced eyebrows look over-the-top silly). But, I digress. \\"Chipwrecked\\" naturally looks fantastic on Blu-Ray, so if you can't get enough of the Chipmunks and those adorable Chipettes, yeah, you'll wanna pick this one up.se newer films (so, don't give me the \\"it's nothing like the 80's Chipmunks\\" routine, your hindsight is rose-colored).

B0063GORYU|5.0|It's been my favorite solitare since I was a kid and this app implements it very well.<br />and I have a 20 word minimum in this box.<br />How stupid is that?  Will I rate again with a stylus?  I think not.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|No shades of grey here.  The popularity of this trilogy completely escapes me.  I tried my best - read all three books thinking that it might be worth it in the end but now just regret the time lost.  I have no issue with the theme or erotica in general, if it is well written.  These two main characters were completely unbelievable, the plot and dialogue were contrived and often  laughable and the sex just not good enough to make up for it.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|Through the Amazon Vine review program, I recently selected something that I thought would make my wife happy... the Belkin Grip Sleeve for Kindle and Kindle Touch.  Actually, I would have liked to have used it myself, but the offered item was Paparazzi Pink.  Uh, no.<br /><br />Anyway... It's quite good for what it's designed to do.  It holds her Kindle securely without it feeling like it'll fall out if you're not careful. The inner lining is also perfect for the device, and should ensure that the screen remains in pristine condition throughout the life of the Kindle... or at least until she wants an upgrade.  I admit I like the \\"grip-iness\\" of the cover, as it gives me that little extra feeling that I won't have it slip through my fingers if I'm not paying attention.  Not that I'll be carrying around the pink one, mind you...<br /><br />I may well end up buying one of my own in black, as I really do like the cover.  If you're ready to spend $25 to keep your Kindle in ideal condition, the Belkin Grip Sleeve is a very good choice.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review Program<br />Payment: Free
1612130585|2.0|I picked up these books because I had heard so much about them.<br /><br />She sold the movie rights to the series so it must be good.  Right?<br /><br />Wrong!<br /><br />As someone that partakes in the lifestyle depicted in these books, it is quite clear to me that the author knows nothing at all about it save for what she has picked up from other novels or read on the internet.<br /><br />No way on earth would a true Dominant behave in the mealy-mouthed, simpering fashion that she has depicted here.  And just because a person has a kink such as this does not mean they are damaged; though this author has gone to great lengths to explain away Christian's \\"kink\\" as nothing more than a by-product of his troubled childhood.  There are plenty of emotionally healthy, intelligent individuals that enjoy both the giving and receiving of pain and it in no way makes them damaged goods.<br /><br />And please, don't get me started on Ana...<br /><br />Her inner goddess, the oh mys and the \\"down there\\".<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />If she can't even find an acceptable word for it, she shouldn't be using it.<br /><br />Just sayin'.
0062082353|5.0|Very well written tale of how it really is in the war zone. The Pravda media in this country today won't tell the real story so it's up to folks like Chris Kyle. Hoo-ah, Chief Kyle.
0439023513|2.0|I was completely engrossed in the first book and finished the second in just a day. When I got to the third I found myself having a hard time getting through it but I thought maybe it was because I had been reading so much over the last few days that I was just burnt out. In reality, it was just disappointing and lacked the personality of the first two books where you really could connect with the characters and feel their pain.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert...<br /><br />When Prim abruptly appears and then subsequently dies just as abruptly, I was waiting for it all to be a nightmare only to have Katniss wake up but she never did. It seemed pointless to bring her in at that moment and make her death such a quick and almost insignificant part of the story when the whole book started with Katniss taking her place to save her life.<br /><br />Then we have Peeta who you'd expect Katniss to fight for, as she did in the other two books but this time because she truly loved him, because she owed him the kindness he always showed her. But then the fact that they end up  together just seems like an afterthought. It is almost like Collins got bored and just wanted to be done with this series so she just wrapped it up as quickly as possible.<br /><br />The fact that Gale and her mother just moved away with no words is just ridiculous. I had to think, why did I read this entire series for it to end up like this? I didn't need a Disney style happy ending, I just needed an actual ending, one that provided closure for all the relationships and all the scenarios that began in book one. This wasn't a bad ending, it just wasn't really an ending at all.<br /><br />I'm disappointed because I don't feel like Collins gave it her all with book 3 and finished it as she started it. I want an alternate ending and I hope at least Hollywood will give it to us.
B00785P2QC|2.0|confusing game. needs to be more User friendly. prefer city story better. would not buy full game. probably going to uninstall.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm a little shocked that these books were targeted at teenagers because I'm a 27 year old mother of a 4 year old and I absolutely loved these books....and thought they were a little too violent to be targeted at such young kids.  It's definitely a great read and finished all 3 books in just 2 days.  highly recommended.
B004XS97KO|1.0|Season four was the last enjoyable season.  The latest season 5 & 6 are welcomed with a new doctor and companion but the in depth mature chemistry and in depth feelings from the likes of Mr Tenant are gone. Replaced by campy, simplistic, teenage chemistry following the likes of Twilight and filled with empty relationship dialogue make these just empty.  The new doctor is like a high school teen flying around for the first time just screaming for someone to lend him some maturity! Replace these two QUICKLY!
B006PTZNSY|1.0|This is just disappointing. I was waiting at least for a bunch of great hip-hop songs. I only hear cheap pop and #1 wannabe songs. Such an example of a sold out artist.
B005HSL626|1.0|For starters their are people who put up bad reviews and for a reason. Because of the stupid ads there are way way too many and they aren't exactly age appropriate for children. I highly woebegone that there was a 0 star that's what this app deserves.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was incredibly interesting and involved. I loved it from the get-go and  looked forward to every moment I had to read it. It was a bummer when I finished as I enjoyed it so much I wanted more! Outstanding book!
B007NCT36U|2.0|she's alot  better off singing than rapping. that gangsta rap stuff is not her stick to pop music. the album is all right . but she is no gangsta.
B00004VWA7|5.0|I remember - well - when this album came out.  I'd been an electric bass player bass player myself at that point for about 15 years, and, oh man, when I heard just...\\"just,\\" what a rediculous conjunction, \\"just\\" Jaco and conga player Don Alias on that killer first track, \\"Donna Lee,\\" I thought, \\"wow, maybe I'd just best concentrate on rhythm guitar.\\"  I'm glad now that I didn't; but Jaco was, is, and always WILL be the electric bass player by whom ALL other bass players are judged.  And a big THANK YOU to producer/BST drummer Bobby Colomby for reuniting Sam & Dave for the following track, \\"Come On Come Over.\\"  Jaco (and Don), you both are missed and you're conspicuous by your absence.  But, hey, Bobby: PLEASE light a fire under Ian Hunter, and get him to share that jam he did with you, Jaco, and Mick Ronson on the \\"All American Alien Boy\\" demo.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that if you've forgotten to read for a while it reminds you.  I love that you can switch translations if you don't understand something or need clarification.  It's even fun to pick a verse at random.  It's easy to find a specific passage or topic or find a passage by a word used.  I just cannot say enough how much I am glad I found this app.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|Say what you want about this album but if you're into HipHop/Rap, you definitely won't enjoy this album much because Nicki Minaj has cross over to the Pop genre. She has about 20+ songs on her album and barely 5 were Rap, the rest were simply Pop. Songs like Stupid Hoe, Beez in the Trap, and Starships among others don't have substance. So you might wanna save your money because she did more singing than actual rapping. This sophomore album is indeed worse and I must say her debut album was better.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A. very fun, addicting game.  It's a little boring when you have to wait for your energy to build up, but I'm still learning!
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|Out of all the last dozen or so albums I've downloaded, this is by far the most versatile and colorful! All the songs are different & full of vocal harmony, quick rifts and tonal variety. this is truly a new, different sound that you can enjoy over and over again. Bought 2 albums & mp3, worth every penny!  Can't wait for the tour... I heard if you buy one CD from best buy they will autograph it when you catch them on tour...  Enjoy!
B007DIQB50|5.0|I've Been A Fan Since The Come Up DVDS So Here I Go.......... I Forced Myself To Kinda Like The Second Half Of This Album Because Nicki Game It To Us! But If Yall Don't Like It Oh Well Move On This Is The Nicki We Will Have To Ge Used To. However I LOVED The First Half! All The Rap Songs She Did Was Classic Nicki Sh@t! I Have A Love Affair With Come On A Cone I Hate The HOOK! Like Really Nicki Girl Get Your Life! Stop That ROMAN!!!! Also For This To Be ROMAN's Time To Shine I Did Not See Much Of Him! What Happened Nicki?
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Finally we received it! My son and I have been wanting this for 2 years and now we have it:) Huge instruction booklet and time consuming build, but lots of fun.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Good but needs better google docs integration...there should be real time editing mode to allow an easier collaboration with other users.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|use notebooks by topic and not divided by &quot;work&quot; and &quot;personal&quot; like some.  it's obvious looking at the list what is for work. works great for gtd or other productivity systems. just adapt to your system. will see how shared notebooks work next.<br />I use this on both Kindle and iPhone. wonderful to have everything in both places.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I purchased the 21 CD first and fell in love with her messages and her hurt. The 19 was not as great as I wanted it to be. I wanted to hear a continued theme from the 21 CD. I still play the 19 but when I want to listen to ADELE in put in the 21. It's her best!!!
B007NCSJYW|1.0|Maybe the next album will be worth buying,this one isn't really worth torrenting.  It really seems like she must enjoy being on daytime shows like Ellen too much.  I really liked Nicki when she was banging out mixtapes but it seems that she isn't immune to the same cliches that plague to other artists, get kinda big and the next album or two (or three)sound experimental maybe even unfinished.  Anyone that 5 stars this album is either a little girl (really or at heart) or a crazy Nicki fan who would buy anything she put out no matter how bad it is.  That's my 2 cents take it or leave it, just felt like putting it out there as someone who was a fan and expected more.
0061537969|5.0|A beautiful book. This man's dog became my best friend. Poor little Enzo will live in my memory for a long, long time.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|I have to say I have not read the comics but I love the show and I haven't bought this item. I think the first season was better but the second season didn't have zombies!!!!!!!!!! Where are the zombies!!!! The end season was epic but where was the zombies in the first 5 episodes? I have to say buy this item it is awesome!!!!!By the the I am 12 and my friends also love the show. SEASON 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you love the walking dead see the comic book series Marvel Zombies.
B003K16P3M|4.0|In the Seven Kingdoms, \\"Gracelings\\" are born.  Gracelings are gifted children.  Born to their parents with normal eye color at birth, but every parent worries that they might change.  Should their eyes change, they would have two different colors along with a special skill, or \\"grace\\" as it is called.  If their eyes change, the Graced child is then taken from their parents and presented to the Kings nursery, where they would be cared for until their grace reveals itself.  When the grace is revealed, the King will determine if he thinks the grace is useful or not for his court, if not,the child would then be returned to the parents.  These gifts of grace can range anywhere from being able to hold their breath for an undetermined time, cooking, mind reading, or the grace of killing.<br /><br />Katsa is a Graceling, graced with the art of killing.  She has one blue eye, bluer than the sky and one green eye, greener than the grass, and all fear her.  At the age of 8, Katsa accidentally  killed her uncle with one hit to his nose.  All she wanted to do was keep him and his wicked thoughts away from her.<br /><br />Katsa lives with her Uncle, King Randa of the Middluns', and is his assassin, punisher, and protector.  And so the story begins...<br /><br />Now for my humble opinion...<br /><br />Katsa:<br />I have read some of the reviews on goodreads.com and amazon.com, and I was shocked at how others viewed Katsa.  I saw Katsa as a girl of 18 who really didn't know much of anything, except how to kill, maim, or fight.  She was never taught how to feel, love, or have womanly feelings, she didn't have friends because everyone feared her.  Day after day all she did was train, and even then it was mostly with sacks of grain and such.  At the age of 11 she was finally told things from Helda about the the body of a woman.  No one would dare get close to her, except for a close few.  How could she possibly want marriage or children?  I wouldn't.<br /><br />Prince Po:<br />A humble Prince who is looking for his kidnapped Grandfather.  Armed with a grace of his own, he sets out to find his Grandfather who is being held somewhere, for reasons unknown. I love his character as I'm sure you will too.<br /><br />Bitterblue:  A young Princess, who a lot of this story will revolve around.  Many have criticized her character.  At first you think nothing of her, but then you find that she has a very strong mind, is opinionated, and smart.  Remember that she IS a Princess and that in those days, they were raised differently.  So for you who criticized not only her name, but her character, shame on you.  She is one of my most loved character's in this book.<br /><br />Regarding the book itself, I love the story.  Katsa grows and finds herself.  I'm looking forward to the next book titled Fire, which I just purchased.  I hope that it's better than this one.  If so, I will fly through it within a day.  I do hope it continues with Katsa & Po as well as introduce new characters.  As for this book, if you can skip over some of the misspellings, grammar, errors and such (as I find in most books), you're well on your way to a good story and you'll want to buy the next book in the series as well.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I wanted to try this based on the good<br />reviews, but the permissions are ridiculous! Why would any sane person actually use this app? Not happening...
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This app says that it is compatible with the LG ALLY on Amazons page, so purchased it just to find out that it is not compatible and will not even install. I have used Splashtop Streamer and remote desktop on my pc and laptop with no problems and love the speed and simpleness of it just wish the Amazon page did not say it was compatible with the LG Ally when it is not.
B000H8SFMK|4.0|This is a hard-hitting but very fun CD of Irish pub songs. It sounds like they have all been enjoying their beer while recording this CD. I heard some of this on CBC II and am not disappointed with what I got. If you want irreverent fun, this is it. Go for it.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Absolutely great application but amazon lacks severely with keeping the updates current. I wish I would have purchased elsewhere. check the author's homepage for options.

0439023513|4.0|The Hunger Games seris has seriously absorbed my life. I love it so much! Ive never liked a book this much... My favorite was the 1st because it was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. The second was good because it was exciting but when i heard katniss was going BACK into the games i was kind of mad! But what else was to suppose to happen? so it was good and the end of the second book was very well thought out. Because to find out the quarter quell was a plan to over throw th capitol and that the gamemaker was against the capitol and the arena was a clock and all this stuff you find out! It was mind blowing! But PEETA!!! ugh. i was so mad when he choked her, even though he turned into some sort of monster i still loved him more than Gale. The thrid book was very depressing and then at the end when Coin says she wants to have more GAMES! I got mad because is Collins really gonahave more games... its like shes running out of things to write about. But the ending and the epilogue was my favorite. I was very happy to see that Katniss ended up with Peeta and they had kids! Overall the books very amazing.
B000089RV6|5.0|i bougt this cd at a store and tryed to put it on my mp3 player from my computer though amazon cloud,and it wont up load.i dont get it, i did it before on a differnt mp3 player,but this one wont let me. that sucks.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I bought one for my wife based upon the reviews of Bluetooth here on Amazon. It seemed to be just what I wanted: relatively simple, effective, reliable and low cost. I installed it for her but she rarely used it.<br /><br />When Nevada made using handheld cell phones illegal I decided to get one for each of my cars as I knew I'd forget to move it. I'm very pleased except for one thing. There is an indicator light which turns green when the phone is on and red when turned off. It isn't large enough and is very difficult to see during the day. Consequently, I'm never certain if the Bluetooth is off or on (my phone \\"responds\\" to the Bluetooth any time the Bluetooth is turned on or off and the response is the same for either). To know for certain I either have to look at my phone which will tell me whether it's connected or not, or take the Bluetooth off the visor and examine it closely.<br /><br />If you are not disconnected and are still within range you will not be able to hear calls on your phone.<br /><br />I'm not certain, but I don't believe that the Bluetooth will turn off automatically after a set time, which would be a nice feature.<br /><br />7/29/13: This Summer has been extraordinarily hot and, despite the fact that the car in which this was installed was driven infrequently and was kept garaged, the board inside the speakerphone warped and sprang the case and some of the buttons. It does still work but I have deducted a star for this defect.
B00792EGES|3.0|I was able to go to an Alter Bridge concert last year in Baltimore and it was AWESOME! I was dissapointed with the dvd for a couple reasons:<br /><br />1. To reiterate what others have said, the use of the f-bombs by Myles was awkward and ridiculous. I was planning on showing my kids but am not able to now.<br /><br />2. I like when Myles sings like the recordings or slightly different. I felt that many of the songs were rushed and he was trying too hard to make the songs sound too unique. Also, I do not want to hear the crowd singing I want to hear Myles. I think it could have been done better.<br /><br />I am glad that I only spent $14.99 for the thing.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|I bought this album and tried to give it a chance, from start to finish I was left confused and upset. Why did I waist my money? Who is this? Why is she cocky and only talking about her money and success? NO track on this album is relatable or has longevity. SELL OUT SELL OUT SELL OUT SELL OUT!

0030565812|5.0|I just had to read Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, because it was referenced and referred to again and again in other books that I've read recently. I knew he was the leader of the African National Congress (ANC), that he had spent a long time in prison, and that he was elected South Africa's first black president shortly after his release in 1990.<br /><br />  I didn't know the magnitude of his strength of character. This is a person who sacrificed his whole life to fight for the principles he believed in. As he said, \\"Men, I think, are not capable of doing nothing, saying nothing, of not reacting to injustice, of not protesting against oppression, of not striving for the good society and the good life in the ways they see it.\\"<br /><br />  I didn't know that after more than twenty years in prison, he was offered a pardon with the stipulation that he return quietly and peacefully to his home in the Transkei. And he turned it down, saying, \\"...if I was released into the same conditions under which I had been arrested, I would go back to doing precisely those things for which I had been imprisoned.\\"<br /><br />  He also had a lot to say about prison which I could relate to: \\"The challenge for every prisoner is how to survive prison intact, how to emerge from prison undiminished...prison is designed to break one's spirit and destroy one's resolve. To do this, the authorities attempt to exploit every weakness, diminish every initiative, negate all signs of individuality - all with the idea of stamping out that spark that makes each of us human and each of us who we are.\\"<br /><br />  In prison, \\"...one must find consolation in being true to one's ideals, even if no one knows it.\\" And sadly, that, \\"In prison the minutes can seem like years, but the years go by like minutes.\\"<br /><br />  I was deeply moved by this story and even though I knew he was going to be released from prison, my emotions got the best of me when he spoke of being released after 27 years. Few people who have walked this planet can match Mandela's humanity, and we all have a lot we can learn from his life and his struggle.<br /><br />Written by David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"er 27 years.

B004UUKDNA|5.0|Great album we have been enjoying for months now. I guess the bands experience with writing commercial jingles makes them experts in crafting tunes that stick in your mind. And yes -- we actually bought the CD version!
B002SAUCBC|5.0|While I agree with the reviewers who criticize the premise of the book, I was still enthralled by the book. I know some will be disappointed by the ending as is the case with a lot of King's books,  but I am one of those who believes the journey of the story is what makes a good book,  not just the ending.  I would encourage anyone who enjoys a simple character based novel to pick this up.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|After seeing the apps from TinyCo, I realized the &quot;story&quot; apps are way too limited and much more greedy<br />I now use them to pass the time
B0034G4P4O|4.0|This is a fun, swash-buckling style adventure, centered around TinTin, an intrepid young reporter who stumbles upon a strange mystery involving ship models, and an old ship sinking mystery. He teams up with a ship captain also embroiled in the mystery, and together they end up traveling around the world in search of answers, pursued by others on the trail of the same mystery. On the plus side, there is a lot of action and chase scenes, an adorable and hilarious dog, and some equally humorous bumbling Interpol detectives. The animation is  compelling, in the 'real-life' style of Polar Express.<br /><br />My only reservation was the gun violence, and the theme of the drunken captain - the captain needs to remember a secret handed down through his family, and at first can't remember because he drinks too much, then starts to remember only when he drinks. He struggles with his drinking throughout the film, and many of the jokes center on this, so I had to try and explain what 'drunk' and 'sober' were to my kids (ages 5-8) in order for them to follow. Also there's a lot of gun shooting in this movie, although little blood (this is in keeping with the source comics.) The plot in general was also a bit complex for them to follow, but they enjoyed the cute dog and action enough for it not to matter in terms of their enjoyment. But parents of young kids may want to take all this into consideration.
0307951529|4.0|The title of this book is sure to attract many - after all, wouldn't many of us love to start up a business on shoestring capital?  Often a deterrent to entrepreneurship is the cost of starting a business but this book explains why a small amount of capital, as little as $100, could very well be all you need. There are also examples provided of people who have successfully done so.<br /><br />That said, be aware that none of the examples are examined with much depth. They are used mainly to illustrate whatever chapter topic the author is writing about. Given that there are so many examples, practically speaking each can't be that detailed but that isn't obvious from reading the book description. The author also makes it sound too easy in many cases - such as how people got an idea, quickly produced a web site and then the orders just started pouring in. Maybe not immediately - like oh, they had to wait a few days, but then paydirt arrived. That's the feeling I got from reading this - that all too often everything came pretty fast and easy and there wasn't a whole lot of sweat or toil involved.<br /><br />Overall I felt there was a lot of good advice in this book. It was well organized and easy to read and understand. It made a lot of sense. The people he used for examples do show that it can be done, and each chapter focuses on one aspect of getting your business started and growing. I found it to be motivating. Yet as I said above, I also thought that in many cases he made it look just too easy - that you build it and they will come. Or you charge it and they will pay. The four stars in my rating are for the advice he gives but I did knock off the one star because of being less than totally realistic.<br /><br />I am glad to have the book and would recommend it, however.<br /><br />[By the way - this review is based on an advance copy. There were some typos and also some missing charts and graphics in the copy I read, but the final version should not vary too muchfrom this in substance]
B00005T30L|5.0|I found this on NETFLIX and something told me I had to rent it and I am glad I did, now I own it! This is a great flick! I recommend it highly.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I'll start off by saying this is a wonderful work, especially the last, title track.  Unfortunately, the CD is defective.  Playing the final track produces annoying stuttering close to the end of the work.  Ripping it into iTunes did so, too.  Well, one computer wouldn't get past the stutter points and the other finished the ripping, but left clicks in the place of the stuttering.  The disc is physically fine.  I can see no flaws in the plastic or the substrate.<br /><br />Get the album, just beware that some of the CDs are defective, but not in a way that you can tell until you play them.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the buzz about how this HOT book was steaming up America so bit and bought.  Pttttfft, what is that horrible taste in my mouth?  Rotten writing!  The story could have been passable in the hands of a better writer but holy moly if I see the word combinations \\"his/her breath hitched\\", \\"she said, huskily\\", \\"inner goddess\\" or \\"bit her lower lip\\" again, I will freaking puke.  I am so mad at myself for spending $10 to chase this hype. And I did finish it, on principal - I hate to throw money away without trying to get my money's worth. Drivel, drivel and more drivel.  I could not delete it fast enough and honestly, I had to think twice about whether or not to review it because I didn't want my name associated with the book.  One star for premise, negative 20 for writing. Do not buy the hype like I did.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Unless you are a real Clooney fan (and I admit I am not), there is no reason to see this film. I guess liking soft porn might be a second reason, but the last. While the scenery is amazing, there is no psychological depth, or any other depth, to be seen here.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|We bought this because our Kinect wasn't picking up our motions unless we stood way far away - but given the layout of our living room, this meant standing up against the couch, so moving backwards for games didn't work and anyone sitting on the couch watching was messing up the game. On a friend's recommendation, I ignored the negative reviews here and bought this Nyko lens set and it worked perfectly, right away. All of our games now work better and we can actually play the side-by-side two player games that didn't work before. Take a chance - if you end up with a bum set, just return it, Amazon makes that very easy. I'd be willing to bet that Nyko has improved the product and that many of these negative reviews are no longer necessary.<br /><br />Also, please note that when you write an Amazon review of a video game accessory, it asks for two different sets of star recommendations and no, the lenses in and of themselves aren't fun (that's the first star rating) but they make the games playable and the games are fun, so I gave it full marks there, too.

0553582038|5.0|A Feast for Crows is easily as good as the previous three books.<br /><br />I believe that most people who disliked it did so simply because there are many new characters and story lines introduced.<br /><br />With all of the loose-ends in book 3, people's expectations were not met.<br /><br />That does not make it a bad book. Its an incredible book. The new story lines and characters are as good as those given in the previous ones. I've actually gotten through this book quicker than book 2.<br /><br />Absolutely amazing writing and story telling.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|An Excellent Double CD Live Document from their last tour recorded in Santiago, Chile. The recording is excellent, the show is as usual high energy with a very vocal crowd and Bruce Dickinson is in fine voice.  How many other bands rock/metal etc that have been together 30+ years still sound as vibrant live as Maiden?  Keep in mind this is not a compilation of Greatest Hits Tracks, this represents a show from the Final Frontier Tour so the song selection will be the set list represented from that tour.  (6 of the Tracks are from the Final Frontier Album)<br />That being said, the highlights for me are some of the new stuff.  The Final Frontier, The Talisman and El Dorado all sound great.  Wicker Man from Brave New World is also a highlight with an energetic and vocal audience providing some vocals.  If you are looking for some of the old stuff that is here too. You will find 2 Minutes to Midnight and the Trooper blending with the newer stuff showing up on Disc One and to close out Disc Two, Seven classics in a row to close out the show.  Overall, a great live document of the Final Frontier Tour.<br />Highly Recommended.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I, in my opinon, stand out among my friends with my reading qualities. I love to read but, can never seem to get what I want in a book. Instead of reading some 75 page book just to get credits, I alwats find myself reading, not even in the teen, but the adult novel section. This book is one of the most engaging yet touching books I have ever read. It took me a day and a half to eat up this book. For me it was very symbolic (in a good way). I just couldn`t get enough. Well written and worth every moment.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|this game is so flaky on the asus tf101 that I can't get past the 1-2 level (second level on adventure).  It will freeze up (but keep playing music) requiring a force quit.  Please address this!!  Would be 5 stars if it would actually play.

Highly recommend!!!!
0811879542|5.0|I absolutely love this book! My daughter is only 7 months old (a little early for this book), and is just discovering how to touch and feel different things. Right now, she enjoys the different colors and how they change from one page to the next. She also enjoys watching mommy do silly things to the book. She has a few books where she can feel different things, and it was so cute when she reached up to rub the dot on the left just after I had done it. :)<br /><br />I think this book has the potential to be a good learning tool for a young one. You can teach them the difference between left and right, various colors, how to turn on and off lights, how to blow on things, etc. (all without the help of technology...what will we ever do without e-books?) Basically, it helps them to learn how to take direction, and that there is a consequence for their actions. (Something that can lead into some interesting discussions and object lessons later.)
0739341243|5.0|Did you know that nearly one out of every two to three adults in the US are introverts?  If not, it's probably because some introverts hide it well, and  have learned to act like extroverts depending on their career choices and situational obligations. This fact, along with so much other fascinating evidence on the subject  of introversion is discussed in detail in, Susan Cain's book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.<br /><br />The author, a self-proclaimed \\"introvert\\", gives the reader much food for thought on the subject of introversion, while discussing the value western society has placed on extroversion. Even today,  bold, out-going individuals, and even young children still in school, are more highly valued. It is the extroverts and are seen as future super-stars, better leaders and better motivators. In contrast, in Asian cultures, it is quiet, humility and sensitivity which is prized. Cain's book points out that much can be learned by listening to quiet,  sensitive  individuals . Cain gives introverts career advice on how to adapt in a business environment that is often centered around meetings, presentations, team building and other group projects, which introverts tend to find mentally draining.  She explains how both introverts and extroverts can contribute to the same organizational goals, even though their preferred styles of achieving will be very different.<br /><br />Particularly fascinating were the research studies conducted by developmental psychologist Jerome Kagan. In 1989, Kagan, and associates began a study of 500, four-month old infants at his Harvard Child Development Lab. Studies showed that some of the young infants, studied were considered \\"highly reactive\\", especially to certain types of noise.  Following these same children, at different ages, and while performing other studies using word games, taste tests and other measures throughout young adulthood, Kagan found that most of the infants who were \\"highly reactive\\" as infants, turned out to be introverts as adults.  He was clear to point out, however, that introversion and shyness and not necessarily linked.<br /><br />I found the subject matter of Quiet, and the way in which the author presented it to be utterly fascinating.  The book was definitely more focused on the subject of introversion, and how many people still view introverts as second class citizens instead of acknowledging their successes.  She mentions the contributions that have been made many introverts:  Bill Gates, Al Gore, Rosa Parks, Steve Wozniak, Eleanor Roosevelt, Stephen Spielberg, and author, JK Rowling to name a few. There was so much in this book to be learned by both introverts and extroverts, especially in terms of working together toward a common goal. Introverts just need to work a bit harder to find the right job for their personality.<br /><br />I saw so much of myself in what the author reported. Preferring solitary activities even as a child, never having more than one best friend at a time, not enjoying crowds or loud music or noise, and recharging by seeking quiet after attending an over stimulating event.<br /><br />Are you are interested in learning a bit more about yourself, a spouse, a child, a co-worker, or a good friend, and what makes each of us tick? You are sure to have a better understanding of the people you interact with every day after reading this book. Highly Recommendedhly reactive\\" as infants, turned out to be introverts as adults.

B002RUA524|5.0|This book is all about a family who travel to Corfu and from the eye of the youngest member who delights in studying animals and birds and insects.  I usually go for action or fiction books and went with some reviews to have a go at this.  It's really a fun book and interesting to read how the young lad looks closer and with more thought at various beings, as well as his own family.  It's pretty funny and you can see some of the events happening which are hilarious.  You just want to travel to Corfu when you read it.  Really enjoyable read and I was sorry to see it come to an end.

0385344228|5.0|3 stories within 1 story as characters develop over past and present. The author keeps moving between characters and time frames without creating confusion. Where each character and the entire story concludes in completely unpredictable, to me at least, until the end of the book. Dramatic.
0143119680|4.0|I've noticed several reviewers comparing this book to the \\"Twilight\\" series. Yes, there is a vampire, a heroine with latent supernatural powers, and flashbacks to days of old. But isn't that ALL stories with vampires? It's an interesting read, filled with information about science, alchemy, language, and literature. It's also geared towards a more mature audience.  However, the one thing I didn't like was the drastic change in attitude of the leading lady...she was independent, intelligent, and bold when the book started out. As her relationship with the vampire ventured into romance, she almost seems absorbed and overshadowed by him. It just seemed that she lost some of the sparkle that drew the reader in to begin with. Bottom line: while there were many similarities to other books I've previously read, this one had enough differences to keep my interest and make me look forward to the two books to come.
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|A friend recommended this film to me because of my academic and personal interests in polyamory (literally \\"many loves\\") and, particularly, how love is negotiated in film. Many films feature and/or follow a character who authentically loves more than one other person, but I thought \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" would be different (better) since this is actually a focal point or central theme. Sadly, the film barely scratched the surface of the complex issue. Instead, the film was boring, predictable, and... trite. It offered nothing new. While there were a couple of good talking points between characters (on love being transient, counter-intuitive, and/or hard to define), the conversations never went anywhere and the issues were never explored. I've seen other reviewers say the film is about \\"youth\\" or \\"self-discovery\\" but these are individuals in their late twenties to early thirties thinking about and making huge, life-changing decisions (like marriage - or going off with a stranger) and hardly taking any of it seriously. I find the characters largely irresponsible, inconsiderate, and shallow -- if not just dull and predictable.<br /><br />What is supposed to make the plot interesting is the fact that Vicky and Cristina are so unlike each other and even more unlike Maria Elena [Juan Antonio's ex-wife] - and yet all three of them have or develop feelings for Juan Antonio. He's the glue, the one thing all the character's have in common: their interest in him. Unfortunately, efforts to step out of their usual way of doing things or explore new ways of arranging relationships are short-lived. For example, (SPOILER) Juan Antonio, Cristina, and Maria Elena wind up in a triad that seems to work really well, with reciprocated love between all three of them, but Cristina leaves the triad because it \\"doesn't work for her\\". Then the dyad between Juan Antonio and Maria Elena falls apart because they no longer have Cristina, the mediator. That was the only somewhat interesting glimpse into non-monogamy the film offered, unless you count the one--almost two--times that Vicky has an affair with Juan Antonio and all the distress that causes her (especially since it becomes clear that she emotionally favors him over her husband). (/SPOILER)<br /><br />These characters were not interesting. The plot was not interesting. The script was not interesting. The acting was not good or inspired. And the narration was extremely annoying. The only real saving points were the beauty of Barcelona AND PENELOPE CRUZ. GOD YES. She looked radiant and her acting *almost* got the film a second star.

B001TW68P4|5.0|The Turtles are most known today for \\"Happy Together,\\" their number one smash from the spring of 1967 that is occasionally heard in movies and TV commercials.  That song leads off this stellar greatest hits collection, and each of their Top 40 hits is here, as well as many other almost-hits that are every bit as good.<br /><br />The band is definitely one of the best not to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  The group placed more songs in the Billboard Hot 100 than the Lovin' Spoonful, another great band that has been inducted.  And the group had many more outstanding songs such as \\"Wanderin' Kind,\\" \\"Glitter and Gold,\\" \\"So Goes Love,\\" \\"I Know That You'll Be There,\\" \\"Just a Room,\\" \\"She'll Come Back,\\" and others that did not become famous.<br /><br />If it is possible to be both famous but still underrated, The Turtles are.  Their body of work of happy, upbeat songs in pop, folk, and psychedelic rock is Hall of Fame-worthy, and they were one of the truly great American rock bands of the Sixties.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I really had to sit and ponder about how to rate this book.  Or perhaps more correctly what I felt when I finished it.  There were a lot of points to consider, mostly good one.<br /><br />Ms. Hamilton does have a gift with characters and dialogue.  I could so totally relate with Sophia and her insecurities.  And Charles is almost too good to be true so I would have taken as long as Sophia did to trust him.  Oh and don't get me started about her mother.  What a piece of work.<br /><br />I loved almost all of the book.  I did find a couple content errors but they were small ones that didn't really pull me out of the story.  What I didn't like was the ending.  It felt as though it was just tacked on so that what was a really good single book could be stretched out into a series.  And I am still not sure what I think about that.<br /><br />This book is worth reading.  Just be prepared for that sudden right turn.<br /><br />I recommend this book to lovers of horror and paranormal romance.  I rate it a 3.5.<br /><br />**I received this book at no charge from the author in exchange for an honest review.

I loved the fantastic balancing and production of the album, as well as the Great variety of music and vocals. Certainly earned its place on my music shelf.
0425221806|4.0|I'm a big fan of cheap and hokey science fiction movies (my secret vice) so I don't mind a little bit (or a lot) of implausibility if the story is a thrill, and I'd put Watchers in that category.  I can quite easily imagine Watchers as a solid B, made-for-tv movie on the Sci-Fi channel.  Travis's willingness to accept the dog, Einstein's, genius intelligence so readily was perplexing.  Nora's metamorphis from virgin, dowdy, spinster into sex bomb in mere months was almost funny.  Vince's sicko killing sprees were (a bit?) over the top.  The Outsider was every kid's nightmare under the bed.  Einstein, the sweet and lovable golden retriever, was the most believable character, and he was genetically engineered!  The book is really good escapism, if you like to feel terrorized once in a while.  I enjoyed it immensely, however, rated it a four instead of five star because the violence was, for my tastes, somewhat overdone.  In an afterward, Dean Koontz, shares with us that this is his favorite novel.  I'm not sure I would agree, as he has written so many other entertaining ones, but he certainly takes the reader to new and different places.

B0079J28NC|5.0|This new 2012 DVD release of Yellow Submarine is advertised as having been lovingly restored frame by frame to ensure the best picture quality since it was first shown in theaters so many years ago. As for the movie itself, if you're a Beatles or animation fan (or hopefully both) and have never seen this film then you owe it to yourself to do so. The Peter Max-esque artwork is spectacular fantasy fun, the script is highly amusing, and the Beatles music chosen for the film sounds as good today as when it was new. Though the Beatles had little to do directly with the film and their voices are impersonated till the live footage of them singing recorded for the end of the film their sensibilities are all over this project and they did compose three new (at the time) songs for the film, all of them terrific. I can't recommend this movie enough and it's very \\"family friendly\\" if you are looking for something fantastic to enthrall your children and introduce them to the music of the Beatles. I saw it in the theater when I was a small child and jumped on buying it on VHS when it was first released. That VHS copy of Yellow Submarine was the most watched movie in our house when our son was very young and I never got tired of it no matter how many times he wanted to watch it. A good thing since he watched it countless times. Now I'm looking forward to this newly restored version on DVD.<br /><br />According to announcements on The Beatles' official website the film has been restored in 4K digital resolution by Paul Rutan Jr. and his team of specialists at Triage Motion Picture Services and Eque Inc. Since the hand-drawn original artwork is quite delicate they have used no automated software in the digital clean-up of the film's restored photochemical elements. All the work was all done by hand, frame by frame.<br /><br />Bonus features for the Yellow Submarine DVD and Blu-ray include a short making-of documentary titled \\"Mod Odyssey\\" (TRT: 7:30), the original Yellow Submarine theatrical trailer, audio commentary with producer John Coates and art director Heinz Edelmann, some brief interview clips with other people associated with the film, storyboard sequences, 29 original pencil drawings plus 30 behind-the-scenes photos. Both Digipak sets will include reproductions of animation cels from the film, collectible stickers, and a 16-page booklet with a new essay by Yellow Submarine aficionado John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios).theatrical trailer, audio commentary with producer John Coates and art director Heinz Edelmann, some brief interview clips with other people associated with the film, storyboard sequences, 29 original pencil drawings plus 30 behind-the-scenes photos.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Filmed during its triumphant Melbourne run at the Regent Theatre, this sparkling production of LOVE NEVER DIES does mend a lot of the problems that the show suffered during its earlier troubled London incarnation.  With a lavish new set and costume concept by Gabriela Tylesova and a fabulous cast of new faces and old favourites, it has earned the praise of Lord Lloyd Webber, and most recently closed at Sydney's Capitol Theatre after a limited 12-week run, which was attended by sell-out, capacity houses.<br /><br />Ten years after escaping to New York with the aid of Madame Giry (Maria Mercedes) and her daughter Meg (Sharon Millerchip), the Phantom (Ben Lewis) has established himself as a showman amid the freaks and oddities of Coney Island, where he has installed Meg as the headlining act of \\"Phantasma\\", his vaudeville theatre.  But he's still haunted by the memory of Christine, the beauteous young girl from the Paris Opera who inspired his creative hand but left him heartbroken.  When he learns that Christine (Anna O'Byrne) has been invited to America to sing for Hammerstein, he devises a plan to divert her journey to Coney, where he hopes she'll sing a new aria he has written especially for her.  Accompanied by her husband Raoul (Simon Gleeson) and their ten-year-old son, Gustave (Jack Lyall), Christine's world seems perfect, but once again confronted by the Phantom, she is also faced with finally dealing with the ghosts of her past...<br /><br />Set ten years after the events of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", the passage of time has severely corroded the familiar characters who return for the sequel.  In the original, Christine was the naïve opera ing&eacute;nue, petrified and yet intrigued by her fascination with the Phantom.  Now at last, Christine has recognised, perhaps too late, their special bond, as she tells her son Gustave - \\"Love is not always beautiful...make sure you don't forget...love you misunderstand is love that you'll regret\\".  The love of Christine and the Phantom has only intensified during the ten long years since he disappeared without trace from the Paris Opera.  When they finally come face-to-face once more, Christine must make a final choice of where her heart truly lies.<br /><br />Critics are always going to find major cracks within the veneer of LOVE NEVER DIES, but the Australian production, under the tight direction of Simon Phillips, finally presents a far more satisfying alternative to the problematic London production.  The London production was a frustrating animal, its various gathered elements almost but never *quite* clicking to create an organic whole.  In the Australian production, the story (slight as it may be) flows seamlessly under Andrew Lloyd Webber's beautiful score (which has undergone significant cutting and re-shuffling since the London opening).<br /><br />Playing the Phantom and Christine are two relative newcomers - Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne.  Anna O'Byrne was one of the Christine covers/alternates in the last few legs of the latest Australasian tour of \\"Phantom\\", and has the most breathtaking voice - she's also one of the most physically-beautiful Christine's I've probably ever witnessed.  Although Ms O'Byrne is still quite young, I'm guessing in \\"real life\\" Christine was probably only in her late-teens/early 20's when she married Raoul and would have only just hit 30 when LOVE NEVER DIES takes place.<br /><br />Ben Lewis gives us a more soulful, mellow Phantom, yet still quite menacing when he wants to be (for instance his threatening to do away with Gustave in order to force Christine to sing at \\"Phantasma\\").  Most Phans feel that Raoul is treated quite shabbily in LOVE NEVER DIES.  The sequel sees Raoul as a bitter, alcoholic mess who cares little for Christine or their son, and squanders the money she makes singing in drinking and gambling.  We're now far away from the starry Paris Opera roof where Raoul sang his devotion forevermore with \\"All I Ask of You\\".  To be fair, Raoul's character is explored quite sensitively in this new revised LOVE NEVER DIES, and Simon Gleeson's performance is fantastic.<br /><br />Having earlier played Meg in the original Australian company of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", it is truly a delight to have Sharon Millerchip, a three-time Helpmann Award winner, back in the role for LOVE NEVER DIES.  Meg is a far more prominent figure in the sequel, and is a much more sympathetic, tragic figure than how she was drawn in the London production.  Maria Mercedes is a steely, powerfully-sung Madame Giry, the former Paris Opera ballet mistress who is now reduced to overseeing the garish kick-lines in \\"Phantasma\\".<br /><br />In the period since LOVE NEVER DIES temporarily closed for revisions in London (before folding altogether), Andrew Lloyd Webber has re-shaped his score, with Glenn Slater and original \\"Phantom\\" lyricist Charles Hart also adding a few new touches.  It's significantly different from what is heard on the 2010 original cast album - and mostly for the better.  Phantom now sings \\"Till I Hear You Sing\\" right at the top of the show, Meg has some added material about her excitement of being reunited with Christine, \\"Dear Old Friend\\" has a lot of new lyrics, \\"Heaven By the Sea\\" has been completely taken out; and there's much more of the original \\"Phantom\\" included, which is lovely.  For instance, Christine sings \\"Twisted Every Way\\" in her dressing room before the music of \\"Prima Donna\\" sweeps her on to the stage of \\"Phantasma\\"; and there's a few reprisals of the 'You have come here' lair motif.<br /><br />LOVE NEVER DIES, it seems, will never be accepted by the serious Phans (who've been campaigning against the sequel ever since Lloyd Webber first announced he was writing one), and that is a shame.  Especially because this particular production, so beautifully staged and put together, is \\"Phantom\\"'s equal in every possible way.  Believe me, I too adore \\"Phantom\\" (it's still my all-time favourite theatre experience) and it took a lot of persistence from me before I embraced what Lloyd Webber has tried to achieve in LOVE NEVER DIES.  There's a lot to love about this show, just give it a chance.  I cried when I saw it at the Capitol and had the exact same emotional reaction with the DVD.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|If you want to spend 90 minutes seeing Meryl Streep trying to get an Oscar nomination by playing (extremely well) an old woman with dementia/Alzheimer's, then this movie is for you. If you are not interested in Margaret Thatcher (one way or the other), don't worry, 85% of this movie is has nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher and could have been about any old woman.<br /><br />So, what about the remaining 15 minutes ?<br /><br />Well, Meryl Streep's performance of Margaret Thatcher (in the 15 minutes that actually deal with her life before dementia) is also fantastic. I mean, wow! Just like Val Kilmer's face is the one I now see when I think of Jim Morrisson, or Forest Whitaker when I think of Idi Amin Dada, Meryl Streep has managed to look more real than the real thing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, having set aside only 15 minutes to develop her life from the 1930's until her ouster from power in 1990, the script is totally disjointed and anecdotic (60 seconds on the Falklands war).<br /><br />In summary, if you like Meryl Streep this movie is for you. But if you love, or hate, or are simply curious about, Margaret Thatcher, then avoid this movie like the plague; you will be immensely frustrated.

He gives highly detailed, practical instructions in implementing the best principles of lean startups in your business.  Having come from two very different startup experiences - one lean and one not - I can say that I wish I'd had his guide before embarking on either of them.  Highly recommended.

0374275637|2.0|Stopped listening to audio version of this book after twenty minutes because I couldn't stand the voice acting. Very slow, annoying intonation. I've listened to 100+ audio books and this was one of only a few times when I stopped because of bad voice narration.

B002IFT1ZA|2.0|I am a big fan of the books, so while I think it is a great story and HBO reproduces it accurately enough, this series just feels cheap and a bit dull.  I don't claim to know anything about the actual financing of the series, but it feels like there was cost-cutting and perhaps rushed production in almost every episode.<br />The cities and castles look fairly dumpy and all of the exterior or crowd scenes are shot close up so we only see a few people and part of a set.  The book (and the opening credits) is filled with great locales, but we never get a sense of any of that in the series.  The Dothraki \\"horde\\" appears to consist of roughly 10 horses, and many scenes that occurred in Vaes Dothrak or on the big grasslands are now staged inside a tent.  Winterfell, where Bran was portrayed climbing high in the sky and surveying the Northland looks tiny and cramped.  The battles are completely absent - afterward someone just appears and announces \\"we won\\", and even the big duels don't manage to even appear dangerous.  Two solid exceptions are The Wall and the lone jousting scene which actually look pretty cool, but the only actors who seem to having any fun are Aidan Gillen (Littlefinger) and Peter Dinklage (Tyrion).  Mostly everyone else delivers their lines as is they can't wait to go home.<br />I think the inevitable comparison of this remake will be to the Lord of the Rings movies and whereas those films occasionally seemed to make Middle Earth spring to life, this series makes Martin's world seem smaller and rather ho-hum. Overall, nothing is terrible about any episode, it just manages to make a sweeping and suspenseful plot seem almost boring.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I think this movie should become mandatory for all to see! (Including Ghandi himself; turns out he might be surprised what was added in the movie :-) ).<br /><br />Anyways, it's a great biography, that should be mandatory for all youth (16+) to see, as teenagers, and young youth could perhaps not appreciate the value of life, and would perhaps see it for the wrong motives.<br /><br />Justice and good judgment, and value of life are more active in 16-20 year olds than the younger ones, and thus it's probably aimed best for these ages!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was not a fan of the Twilight series.  I dropped off after the first book.  I thought this would be more of the same, and had steered clear until a number of friends who share my taste in reading recommended it.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) shares an incredibly close relationship with his father, Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks). Oskar is an extraordinary child who has some very particular social quirks. His list is rather extensive and it's revealed that he was once tested for Asperger's Syndrome. However, Thomas Schell spends a great amount of time with his son and does everything he can to help him overcome his fears. However, on September 11, 2001 as the world changes forever, tragically so does the life of Oskar and his mother, Linda (Sandra Bullock), as Thomas was in the second tower of the World Trade Center when it fell. Linda attempts to move on with life, but Oskar refuses to move forward. A year later, he accidently destroys a blue vase while rummaging through his father's closet and discovers a key in an envelope simply marked \\"Black\\". Thomas constantly played games with Oskar and led him on journeys around the city, hiding clues and prizes in the most unexpected places. Oskar is convinced the key is a gift left behind by his father to send him on one last adventure. Determined to find the door the key unlocks, Oskar begins a systematic search of the city, trying to locate the person with the last name \\"Black\\" who will be able to help him solve the mystery. Along the way, Oskar becomes acquainted with a man his grandmother has been renting a room to. The man seems to have no name and is simply known as \\"The Renter\\" (Max Von Sydow). The Renter is a survivor of WWII and reminds Oskar of his father. The two become unlikely companions and friends as they search the city to unravel the mystery of the key.<br /><br />EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is based upon a 2005 novel by Jonathan Foer. I've not read the novel, so I can't compare the movie to the book.<br /><br />The movie is an extremely moving piece of cinema. It goes to places that the audience might not suspect. The movie has a satisfying ending, but it's not necessarily a happy one. Like life, Oskar's journey doesn't turn out exactly as he had hoped. However, like all journeys, it changes his life forever.<br /><br />The acting in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is amazing. Tom Hanks plays a small, but important role. Newcomer Thomas Horn is so powerful that it's difficult to believe this is the first time he's ever acted on film before. Sandra Bullock has a strong supporting role that is worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Max Von Sydow speaks no lines, but his eyes speak more and convey more emotion than the most well trained politician. John Goodman has what is basically a cameo as Stan the Doorman, but it's always a joy to watch Goodman perform, even in a role such as this. There are numerous smaller roles in the various Blacks that Oskar meets. Most of these characters are only on screen for a few brief moments but each of them ground their scenes in realism. EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a good movie that is made great by the acting performances. If for no other reason, it's worth watching for the acting alone.<br /><br />EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a very emotional movie. For Americans, particularly those who lived and worked in New York on September 11, 2001, it will probably have a different kind of reaction. However, though the story is told through the lens of September 11th, the film is really a story about a young man coming to grips with the unexpected death of his father. It's a film that will probably resonate with anyone who has lost a parent they were close to. I cried several times and the film really made me think about my own Dad and his untimely death. I left the theatre thinking about many of the memories I have of my Dad. It made me a little sad, but very grateful. In the future, I'm sure that EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a movie I'll watch whenever I'm sad and thinking about my Dad because I know that though it might cause a few tears, it'll cheer me up in the end and, like Thomas Schell and my own father, encourage me to not stop looking for whatever adventure life holds.er, encourage me to not stop looking for whatever adventure life holds.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|In Dartmoor, England a teenage boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine), watches in fascination as a thoroughbred colt is born. The baby horse is a beautiful animal and watching the equine run through the fields soon becomes Albert's new hobby. The day comes when the horse is taken to auction. Albert's father, Ted (Peter Mullan) comes to market to buy a plow horse, but when he sees the magnificent beast and spots his landlord smirking on the other side of the fence he ends up paying a small fortune to purchase the animal. Albert names the horse Joey and sets to training the animal. When the landlord threatens to take the family farm, Albert trains the animal to wear a horse collar and plow a field. However, when a destructive storm ruins the family's turnip crop, Ted is forced to sell the horse to the British cavalry for the war that has just been declared (1914). The animal is purchased by Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) who promises Albert that Joey will be his personal mount and he will return the horse to him after the war. It's off to France and after a foolish offensive Joey loses his mount and is captured by the Germans. What follows is an extraordinary journey for Joey as he changes hands from one owner to the next. The horse has a remarkable spirit of determination and raises to every challenge that comes before it. Meanwhile, Albert has joined the Army and is fighting on the Western front and carries with him an illustration of Joey. He's convinced they will find each other again.<br /><br />WAR HORSE is an impressive movie. Visually, the film is a cinematic kaleidoscope of stunning wonder. It's like watching a Terrence Malick film, but with an actual story and lots of action.<br /><br />The main character in the story is Joey, so if you don't like horses, you might not like the film. However, the human actors all do a fine job. Some of them are only on screen for a few minutes in a couple of scenes, but each of them excellently portrays the emotional depth of their characters. There are some who might say that the movie is filled with characterizations and no real acting, but this isn't the case. Most of the acting in the movie isn't done in broad gestures and over articulation. Instead, the real acting happens in the small moments: the way the eyes light up, the gentle turn of the head, etc. For instance, there is a scene where a German regiment invades a small farm and takes everything away from the farmer and his granddaughter who live there. There really isn't much action that happens in this scene and there aren't many words. However, volumes are spoken between the characters in how they say things and in the little things they do. WAR HORSE is filled with scenes like that.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a horse or animal person, you can take a lot away from WAR HORSE. Though a horse is the main and title character, the movie is really about hope, perseverance, and determination. It is a story about the deep friendship between two kindred spirits. It's an ancient story that's been told again and again throughout history (the Biblical story of Joseph, ODYSSEY, THE AENIED, E.T., etc.). It's a story that resonates because it touches something deep within each of us. It's a grand old story, but in WAR HORSE it's just told through the eyes of a horse and his boy.depth of their characters.

B006LQQ1GE|1.0|First, let me admit that I had never heard of Gotye (Wouter \\"Wally\\" De Backer) prior to hearing \\"Someone That I Used To Know\\" on Sirius XM, and that I bought the CD based upon my liking for that song.  Not the brightest move, I'll readily admit.  \\"Someone That I Used To Know\\" is a complex, interesting song, and I like it more each time I hear it.  Unfortunately, the rest of the songs on this CD bear no resemblance to \\"Someone That I Used To Know\\".  As other disillusioned buyers have noted, nothing else on this CD reflects the musicianship or \\"feel\\" of \\"Someone That I Used To Know\\".  The opening number is a brief, annoying instrumental, reminiscent of some of the filler on Pink Floyd's albums (at their worst) and the other songs might be compared to Peter Gabriel, also at his worst.  If you love \\"Someone That I Used To Know,\\" save yourself some money and buyer's remorse and download the MP3 single.

1932100660|5.0|I am the quintessential American.  I love meat.  I love eggs.  I love milk.  I love ice-cream.  I love a huge boat of chili fries topped with pastrami.  I love donuts.  I love the whole package.  In fact, I still love all those things and I know I always will.<br /><br />However, this single book so drastically changed my worldview on food, nutrition, and the Western diet that I will never be the same again.  I simply cannot go back knowing what I know now.  The science and logic behind this book is truly formidable.  It is daunting in its scope of literature and it challenges any and all current medical understanding between diet and nutrition in the Western world.<br /><br />I will not spend the time discussing the details of the book.  At the time of this review, there are over 1100 reviews so I will not waste my time adding that information.  I merely want to say I have radically been changed and that the change is not one of drudgery.  I love a plant-based food diet.  I learn more and more recipes and I feel fantastic!  I have lost 22.5 pounds. My 4 year struggle with moderately highly blood pressure (137/85) dropped to 114/60 within 3.5 weeks of eating a purely plant-based diet.<br /><br />Even if a reader refuses to give up meats and dairy, NO ONE should ignore this book.  You want to continue eating meat and dairy and be proud of it?  Fine.  But you first must plummet through The China Study and see if it does not change you in a dramatic way!

0307956350|3.0|Not going to go into major detail about the contrived espionage going on here in this novel, much has been written before me. Seems so many people rave about this book and others really don't like it at all. I am somewhere in the middle. I found it to be quite rambling and jumping all over the place. I had an uncorrected proof of this book which I won. Unfortunately, the pages went from one typeface to another which I found distracting so I kept putting the book aside. I know that has nothing to do with the story, I did really try to love this book as much as the hype. I thought so much of it was convoluted nonsense and inane details. I found it distracting to the point of having to wonder what the author was aiming for at points in the book. I wanted to read a book that built up the suspense and tied it all together into a finely tuned mystery. I ended up feeling like it was really fragmented storytelling. I did feel that the book could be made into an interesting movie because the premise of the story was good and with some work a pretty good screenplay could come out of it. So, I stand midway on this one. I wish the flow was smoother on this one.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|My husband picked up the first book in the 'Song of Fire and Ice' series for me as a fluke.  Someone at our local bookstore had recommended it, and I actually let it sit around my house for several weeks (GASP!) as I picked my way through a random selection of other books that my husband had brought back from the book seller.<br /><br />When I finally got around to reading the first book in the series, \\"A Game of Thrones\\", I was hooked!  I promptly picked up every other book in the series that I could get my hands on, and many nearly-sleepless nights later, I was among the throngs of George R. R. Martin fans clamouring for more!  More!  MORE!<br /><br />Fast forward to 2011, and my friends started sharing their experiences with me about the HBO series of the same name.<br /><br />It was unanimous opinion among ALL of them; \\"Game of Thrones\\" was well worth the wait, and they LOVED it!  It was suddenly clear (to me) what had been holding Mr. Martin up from producing the next book in his much anticipated 'Song of Fire and Ice' series-- Mr. Martin's collaboration with HBO in creating the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series, while it had a few minor production flaws (lack of elaborate battle scenes although many of those come later in other books of the series, some continuity issues with the \\"walled\\" cities in various scenes, a few continuity issues with the hordes of Khal Drogo), was a finely done project worthy of the source material it was derived from.<br /><br />For a FIRST SEASON run of a series, I admire the high production values that HBO upheld for \\"Game of Thrones\\".  It was obvious that a lot of time, effort, and funding was invested on a 'gamble'... to see whether or not a fantasy-based series would be a success.  HBO had gone out on a limb to create an uncensored, unadulterated cable program based on a series of 'fantasy' novels (something I imagine was difficult for HBO executives to give the \\"green light\\" on), and in my opinion, they knocked it out of the ballpark!<br /><br />If my local retail stores were any indication (every Blu-Ray copy was sold out by the first day, and most of the DVD copies were, too)-- they have a HUGE winner on their hands.<br /><br />I won't give away any 'spoilers', but after watching the finale of the last episode, I am on the edge of my seat for the next season!
B0073XORCY|5.0|FIRST THOUGHTS (4 STARS)<br />After listening to Ian Anderson's new CD, I just can't bring myself to call this album \\"Thick As a Brick 2\\". More aptly, I think it should have been titled \\"What-If's, Maybes, Might-Have-Beens\\". This solo album from Ian Anderson is actually very good, especially if you like his recent solo endeavors and I do! I think it's a way bit more upbeat and rockin' comparied to Rupi's Dance and Secret Language of Birds. The musicianship is tight and the songs and musical phrasing are interesting, although any connections to the orginal TAAB are are cloudy and contrived at best, particularly so far removed from the original TAAB in time, style and artist maturity. Nonetheless, I for one am glad that Ian is still making music at age 64. You just have to remember that his days of creating progressive rock \\"classics\\" are living (but still living strongly) in the past.<br /><br />WHAT IF Jethro Tull still had the energy and the creative verve to really do a TAAB2? (one worthy of comparison to the original). MAYBE Ian Anderson and Martin Barre should have truly collaborated on such a project because the result....MIGHT HAVE BEEN outstanding!<br /><br />MORE THOUGHTS (Upgraded to 5 STARS)<br />Now that I've listened a few more times to the entire disc, I've realized how making a sequel to TAAB is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing for all the attention it brings to this recording and its a curse when people inevitably attempt to compare it the the original. I really like this CD! With each listen, it becomes more dynamic and interesting. Ian's flutework and even his vocals sound good, the guitars and drums in their upbeat moments are a welcome and energetic addition from previous efforts, and the lyrics are appropriate and timely. At times, a bit too much of the sound from Ian's previous solo efforts come forth and this tends to soften the dynamic a bit. I really like the songs Kismet in Suburbia, Shunt & Shuffle and Old School Song. It's also nice that some elements from the original TAAB are used, albeit sparingly. Overall, I'll take this for what its worth and totally enjoy it for what is is: New Music from Ian Anderson! However, I'm also going to leave my impressions of the original TAAB intact and keep Gerald Bostock in my mind as his precocious, eight year old self.nice that some elements from the original TAAB are used, albeit sparingly.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|Usually when I think about trains I think of my childhood (and on) love affair with that then vanishing way of getting around. Simple enough when  the local commuter train, then soon to be abandoned in the 1950s golden age of the automobile, the highway and the Howrad Johnson's (and subsequently McDonald's) pit stop night, came tooting its lonesome whistle in the high North Adamsville night. Or that same fascination held up later when I took my first baby steps on the endless search for the great blue-pink American West night and wound up a few time travelling in some desolate empty  box car pushing the Southern Pacific high desert night. And no question, even now I have very strong memories of what Tom Waits called in one of his mule variation day dreams- \\"living on train smoke and dreams.\\"<br /><br />But enough of nostalgia, earned or not. For the film under review, Unstoppable,  is a very different cinematic look at the modern day train experience on the American tracks. Trains and disaster, or the threat of disaster,  are no strangers today, and have not been since the beginning of the railroads. The runaway train that stars in this film, the old 777 running highly dangerous cargo through rural Pennsylvania in this case, is just a continuation of the danger associated with tangling with the train smoke (from whatever fossil fuel used). And this saga is based on a real incident too boot.<br /><br />Through carelessness (and corporate speed-up policies) a railroad man makes a series of wrong decisions about how to fix a problem on his long-line freight train. And the thing takes off-ummanned. Naturally all hell breaks loose as everyone from the yard master to corporate headquarters tries to figure out how to stop the thing short of shooting it (although that thought I am sure crossed somebody's mind). No problem though because old railroad man Denzel Washington, ready to be tossed on the washed-out heap and training his \\"new boy replacement,\\"  just happens to be on that same track coming the other way. Now once Denzel Washington is on the case, any cinematic case, from cop to Malcolm X to washed-out train engineer, one can rest easy. Sure there will be a couple of close calls, quite a few actually, in the hour and one half of the film but at the end of the day no highly explosive cargo is going to harm urban areas. No way. Now we can all go back to thinking about train smoke and dreams.

B002ZDOXLW|5.0|When I first came about Loreena's music, it was in a movie called \\"Soldier\\". I found that the movie Soundtrack from that movie didn't have that song through someone who was seeking the same thing on Amazon. \\"The Book of Secrets\\" was the first album that I found that had the song. I also bought \\"An Ancient Muse\\" for the beautiful cross of Celtic and Arabic music that I heard. Her style is quiet and smooth and she does sing in some but has also some instrumentals that are well worth a listen. \\"Ketarichomene\\" and \\"Caravanserai\\" are beautiful pieces, evoking desert lands and starlit nights.She sings a beautiful ancient ballad in \\"Under a Phrigian Sky\\" and the \\"English Ladye and the Knight\\".

There have been many stories that have been told, but I feel that this one completely depicts what families must've been feeling on that day and the days following it. This movie is not for the feint of heart; have a box of Kleenex nearby. But I recommend it to all. It was a phenomenal movie and I am very glad I saw it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible reading plans are invaluable in keeping me on track with my devotional life!!!! The variety of versions allows me great options to see how other versions say it.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|I think that. not many people can install it but it is fun though not many levels so I think it is in the middle.
B006TGWY3K|5.0|Their sixth album delivers strong songs for every Lacuna Coil fan.  The band sounds even more like a metal band now, cranking out harder-sounding songs like \\"Upside Down\\" that features some of the band's best metal guitar work so far and \\"Kill The Light\\" showing off more pounding drums and determined bass.  \\"The Army Inside\\" and \\"Fire\\" seem designed for the entire band to give everything they've got in a live show, and as a fan who has seen them live more than once I can't wait to see these new songs performed!<br /><br />This being said, the last two albums differed from this one in a strong way: Cristina Scabia had been basically the lead singer on [[ASIN:B000TDGAFM Karmacode]] and [[ASIN:B0026BI0G2 Shallow Life]].  Most of their popularity in America has been from [[ASIN:B000X9G6AQ Comalies]] and onward, so with the majority of the American fans used to Cristina taking the lead in vocals, changing back to their older format was a slight risk but one that in my opinion needed to be taken.  So in [[ASIN:B006TGWY3K Dark Adrenaline]], Andrea Ferro sings more than he did on the last two albums--way more.  I've been getting friends into this band for the past few years and they gravitate towards the last two albums but I've been a fan of ALL of their albums and I think having more Andrea singing makes things better and more interesting as a \\"new\\" direction after the last two albums.  I loved having more Cristina on the songs, but doing it like this for a third album in a row would have been strange in my opinion.  If fans want more Lacuna Coil songs with lots of Cristina's vocals, buy the last two albums and keep listening to those.  This album sounds like ALL of the band is having an excellent time and giving the songs as much power as possible, and I think this album sounds more suited for the band to play live in its entirety than the last two did.<br /><br />I especially like how the mellower-sounding songs had more Andrea as well.  The guy can sing very well and the last two albums had Cristina handle the softer sounding tracks like \\"[[ASIN:B000TDB2T6 Within Me]]\\" or their cover of Depeche Mode's \\"[[ASIN:B000VIR80Q Enjoy the Silence - EP]]\\" almost by herself but the new songs like \\"End of Time\\" and \\"My Spirit\\" were amazing as both singers shined very well.  Their cover of R.E.M.'s \\"Losing My Religion\\" was made even more interesting by having both singers and the band turn it into more of a rock song than the original.<br /><br />I think this album would please both types of fans: ones who mostly know the last two albums and ones who have been fans since their beginnings.  Also, fans who became fans at one of their shows who enjoyed the entire band having fun like they always do live to have the perfect album to have captured that spirit.  Lacuna Coil has never disappointed me and this album is amazing.  Five stars!<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />\\"Soul Inmate\\" (left off of this version of the album and is only available as an iTunes bonus tack) was one of the strongest songs from this album's sessions and could even be a great single.  All of the versions of this album (Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, etc.) don't have this track and I think it's a shame.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This case really touched my heart when I heard about it on the news. So I really wanted to read this book. I found story very sad & inspiring. I really think Jaycee was really brave for writing this book letting the world know what she went through. I think the kidnappers got what they deserve. My heart goes out to all the kids that got kidnapped & surivived. The system definitely failed this girl I just hope the system took this case as a lesson to prevent things like this from happening to someone else's child. This book taught me 2 things always hug & tell your kids you love them. Never let your kids walk to school or home alone by themselves.
B0018EO6R0|5.0|THis lady has an epic voice( I think lady) This is my first time listening to nightwish as a whole albulm IVe heard sleeping sun from narnia soundtrack> But it doesnt do justice to the whole albulm!! aWSOME!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game in the market !!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />its fun lots of games. fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
0307592731|5.0|All these other reviewers told you about the book.....I'll just tell you that you must read this book!  Especially as a woman, I was amazed by what Cheryl Strayed did, how she did it, and that she not only survived but grew tremendously from the experience.  Based on her lack of preparation, knowledge, experience and training, she was one strong and lucky lady to get through this experience the way she did.  It's light and easy to read with a wonderful message and the end made me cry.  ENJOY!!!
B004HW7JHE|2.0|24-Sep-2012 update: Last night's Emmy snub might be seen as a vindication of those - including me - who noted this season's nose-dive. I hope MM's writers will rise to the challenge.<br /><br />Judging from the 01-Apr episode, the writers have lost faith in their own ability to create a period drama which is relevant to modern viewers, by means of subtlety, suggestion, art, allegory, contrast, or any other mechanism more elegant than a rubber chicken with a sign about its neck.<br /><br />I generously proffer two stars, as I rather liked the first episode. Others, lacking tasks of importance in their lives, may be pleased to find that the rest of the season will not have degenerated into pratfalls and sound effects. So that their collective Hope is not dashed, I will reserve my right to Change my rating by one-half star.
B005723JSQ|4.0|This book was quite fun and easy to read, I couldn't put it down, I always wanted to see what happened next, yes, it is quite predictable, but it was more about her wit and the situations than the mystery (none), and yes she was a little immature, and definitively shouldn't have sent a bunch of texts to Sam's colleagues, but she was fun and Sam was nice.<br />I guess I identified with her that I like to be liked and don't want confrontation, so even within the unbelievable I found her real.<br />The only issue, as others have mentioned, it's the fact that the foot notes are at the end of each chapter, and by the time you finish it and read them you don't know anymore what they were related too, I am sure that in the book edition they would be fun to read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|its so cool how you can get up every morning and check the weather of what to were and not be worried about if it will be cold or worm
B002MQYOFW|5.0|How is it possible to give this masterpiece less than 5 stars! I'd give it a hundred!<br />I mean, it's been a really really really long while since all my desires came down to turning pages. It is terrific literature. A book that WILL BE READ many decades after we all say our Hi to the Lord. Why? Because it tells the story of a battle between humanity and its opposite within people's hearts.<br />The language is beyond compare.<br />Guys, don't you make the biggest mistake of your lives by not reading it.
B007E73MSY|4.0|I was amazed how good this record is. A good blend of death, thrash, and very few softer rhythms ala old Soulfly. It is a great rebound from Omen which I though was very average except for a few tracks. It is their best record yet (then Dark Ages). Considering that the last few times I saw Max play he barely played guitar and his vox were so-so, I though this record was gonna be average... Rizzo was dead on each time of course, he is amazing and I don't know much input he has on music writing but I suspect he had a good amount of input on this record. Anyway, I hope Max gets his health back and gets rested up cuz his live performance needs to improve. My favorite tracks are: World Scum, Gladiator, Legion, Redemption of Man By God, Treachery, and Plata O Plomo.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game the graphics the birds and every thing but I didn't like how I beat the game in 2 days the game is to easy
B005HSL626|5.0|This app works great on my kindle fire. I have had no problems with it. The ads (yes, there are ads) do not mess up a game in progress and can be easily exited out of.<br />I love this game and would recommend it to any age. Little kids enjoy hearing the squishy sounds, and older people enjoy slicing the fruit.<br />The blades are fun to unlock, but the challenges you must complete are... challenging enough to keep you interested.<br />I highly recommend this game, ESPECIALLLY because it is free.
B0052RCX0G|5.0|I start reading the book and I found it really amazing, I thought that if I were at the British Museum and I saw the objects listed in the book I would look them without really any attention. But when you read about them in the book your second view on the object is different, you found a interesting history behind them, you understand their sgnificance. The book also awake your interest in knowing more not only about the object but of its all entourage.<br />I am waiting for \\"The history of the world in another 100 objects\\", and I would like to have more of this books for others museums of the world.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this. game.  it is very addictive. I give it to the kids and they play on it all day long.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|best series since twilight. read all of them within a week. last one was as good as the first. great reads. highly recommend
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|I saw WNTTAK in a book store and had read the backside of the cover and felt it would be interesting and intriguing to read.  I bought the kindle edition for my kindle fire and started reading it. it was unlike any other book I had read because of the prose style. It was in letter form, which was a bit hard to get used to because I felt as if there was very little dialogue and a lot of explaining done by the author, which i suppose needs to be done so you can get an idea of the estrangement and also the area that they lived in, but you only need so much.  It was interesting to read about how Kevin was such an estranged child and his mother Eva seemed to resent her own child for being such a way, but a mothers instinct is always right, she knew he was a troubled one from the moment he was born.  I read about 50 percent of this book on my kindle fire and just couldn't seem to get passed any more. There was no spark for me like I have had with other intense books. It was quite disappointing to me, as I always seem to give a book a chance but this one I had a very hard time with. So needless to say, it was a 1 star for me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|if you like card games you will love spider solitaire.  I play it all the time totally addicting. I recommend this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good app the games are fun but can be challenging. makes it more fun in my opinion. its an all around great app
B0063GORYU|4.0|I ENJOY THE CHALLENGE OF HAVING MANY MORE POSSIBLE PLAYS THAN REGULAR SOLITARE. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO SOLITARE FANS.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love it all of the reading plans really guide you in the right direction if you are lost and wanat some direction.
0446547603|5.0|I am not going to go in to all the details of this story, as I hate reviews that do that but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I found it slow to start and at one point even considered giving up on it. I felt that the story was headed in a predictable direction and even though parts of the story were easy to figure out, I found that I could not put the book down once the plot was unraveled. I liked that this story wasn't all about the love story, although of course there is a strong love element to the story. It also has a darker side and allowed for insight in to the mind of someone that most of us hopefully never have to experience. The end was a nice surprise as well. Highly recommend this story!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Arctic Silver 5 works wonders! This is my favorite thermal paste by far. Every time I upgrade a CPU, or build a new computer entirely, I make sure there's enough Arctic Silver to get the job done. Far too many years I was completely oblivious of the importance thermal pastes have on CPU performance and overall longevity. It wasn't until I was preparing to build my first computer that discovered the value of using a high performance thermal paste. Applying Arctic Silver, instead of the cheap gunk provided by CPU manufacturers, resulted in huge gains in benchmark performance. My CPU was cooler, more stable, and capable of being overclocked without threatening stability. I have complete confidence saying I'll never purchase thermal paste from another company!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pop ups and ads are annoying, but there are a LOT of games and it is a great time-waster. If you don't mind ads, get this app.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Wow, what a great little case. And what a great price! so simple, just clean up the screen with the enclosed cloth, add the screen protector using the little Amazon \\"squeegee\\" that comes with it and fit it into the case. The case is snug and thick enough to protect the phone from little bumps and bruises, but small and unobtrusive enough that I don't feel like i have a huge lump in my purse. Plus the \\"rubbery-ness\\" of the case makes it less likely to slide off surfaces.<br />All in all, a great solution to protecting your I-phone for very little money.
B004BSFC46|3.0|I purchased these for my infant grandson.  They are adorable but the wrist size is for smaller infants.  My grandson is 2 mos old and these are already tight on him.  Plus at his age now, he's too young to know that they on on his hands.  The concept is great, but we'll have to see whether or not they'll fit in the next couple of months or not which should be the time he's noticing his hands more.  Currently, we just hang them from his activity mat for him to reach out to.
B0073U2FB2|2.0|This film was a terrible disappointment, mainly as I expected much more than what it was.<br /><br />The story itself is probably passable for a movie. Some Americans in Moscow are caught up with aliens invading Earth for its mineral. Nothing terribly original in the story. Although I thought some of the lines of dialogue were interesting.<br /><br />So it is all up to the characterization, acting and the filming to make the movie something. Unfortunately, nothing like this happened. I did not think any of the characters were particularly interesting. The acting was poor as was the filming.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this apps is awesome . my son loves it he downloaded in all our iphone kindle and his itouch. he really enjoy it bey much.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app us a fun way to pass the time while on the go. I find most of the games to be very enjoyable.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is one of the hundreds of quotes I could make after my daughter has watched this undreds of times. She says its the best movie ever made and on that basis alone I give five stars, besides she is never wrong!

B005HI4LMS|5.0|If you're a slasher movie aficionado, you're going to love Tucker and Dale vs Evil.  Carefully and cleverly inverting the backwoods-hillbilly variant of psycho-killer movies, T&DvE places two incredibly nice, unbelievably sweet hillfolk centerstage, while the sexy college kids provide the actual evil in this film.  A comedy of errors gone horribly, horribly awry, T&DvE has plenty of laughs that tribute, rather than spoof, the genre it satirizes.  Firefly's Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine are pitch perfect as modern, civilized bumpkins who want nothing more than to spruce up their new vacation home by the lake, while Katrina Bowden actually gets a chance to act in a great Final Girl twist.  The cast of college teens is largely interchangeable, but props go to Jesse Moss for being the douchiest \\"prey\\" to turn predator to date.<br /><br />This is a seriously fun movie that has obvious love for its source material.  Fans of the genre - esp. some of the wackier installments (like Nightmare on Elm Street Pt 2 or Jason X) - should not miss this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I played it on my wife's kindle fire and loved it so much downloaded it on mine and my phone!!!
B00081U7HC|1.0|Ever watch special features from your DVD and wonder why they left the clip out? Well.... with Pretty Woman Special Edition, ugh, their special feature edition is just terrible! It ruins classic scenes especially \\"slippery sucker\\" and makes the end of the film even worse. I loved Pretty Woman in its original version and am seriously considering a dollar garage sale or donation for this one.
B003VANOFY|5.0|OMG.. i have had tons of headsets in the past as i am an avid gamer and music lover. I recently purrchased the Plantronics audio 995 or whaterer it was called. got it home and it was junk. 4 hour charge time adn you couldnt use it while charging. didnt even turn it on so i went back to best buy and picked up this MONSTER of a machine.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY-----<br />just pulling it out of the box i got chills  as to how well it felt. popped in the dvd and ran through set up wich was very easy.. then i connected it to the Charge base / wireless tower. (wireless and charger cable from one usb port? OMG YES) turned it on and clicked the \\"Expirence 7.1 surround button\\"<br /><br />Let me tell you... i didnt know music could sound this good. The intro and demo music gave me Goosebumps at LEAST 5 times.. immediatly boppin my head to the random music that was probably made just for the tutorial. So i immediatly started playing some of my favorite songs and i heard a little part of a song i had never heard before and it sounded like it was comming from my kitchen and scared the crap out of me and i turned around real fast thinking someone had broke in my house LOL.<br /><br />Currently listening to some heave bass techno songs testing out its high and low limits. My computer volumes is max, my media player volume is max, and my headset volume button is at max... NO DISTORTION.. Crystal CLEAR even at MAX volume but a little too loud at max for my ear drums to process.. knocking it back a little is spot on.<br /><br />Bass is excelent... if you have ever been in a car with subs.. this is comparable... except the crap hanging from your rearview mirror wont dance around LOL.<br /><br />Settings and hardware-------<br />The setting are easy to use and well laid out..drop down menus for each of the 3 hardware buttons wich seem well placed on the left earpiece and easy to find.<br />really like the option to change the voice by pushing one of the bottons (optional by the drop down menu) 6 or 7 different voices to choose from.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Awesome Sound quality<br />Great hardware.. feels comfortable...<br />ear holes are big enough for my ears (and Ipso facto should be big enough for yours :P)<br />mic is fairly easy to move and doesnt move on its own<br />charge while using it !!!!!!<br />battery low notification on taskbar and audible warning (both optional)<br />comes with a 6 hour charge<br />tells you how long untill it will be fully charged when charging (in the settings page)<br />allows for setting up profiles<br />option to turn surround off<br />volume is a roller that is easy to use and feels comfortable to use and easy to find.<br /><br />Cons:<br />In the song 300 violin orchestra by Jorge Qui i can only hear 297 of the violins. for shame :P<br /><br />there really are not any cons.<br />it is going to make it difficult to watch Big Bang Theory and play games lol<br /><br />I do have a suggestion for Microsoft that could be considered a con i guess.<br /><br />the right side of the head phones has NO buttons. it looks good but i think one big mute button or a kill all sound button<br />could have been a nice fit here... like if you think your phone is ringing you could reach up and hit that to find out.<br />would be a nice addition.. also the addition of bluetooth to make it so when someone called my phone the headset would let me know<br />and allow me to answer it and use the headset to talk.<br /><br />No realy problems with the hardware and seeing as the 2 suggestions i have are not intended to be on this headset they cant really be considered cons.<br /><br />Save your money and get this... you will be more then happy with the price when you get these things on your ears and hit that \\"expirence surround button\\"<br /><br />Will recommend to EVERYONE i know that uses headphones.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|She just talks too much, which makes the Holiday a 3 star instead of a 4 with me, even though Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black and Eli Wallach do a wonderful job with a touching and heart-warming script. Not to give the film away too much... it begins with two break-ups and two woman exchanging houses in two different countries for the Christmas Holiday. And quite unexpectedly when Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and Iris (Kate Winslet)learn to take risks, several love stories unfold for them. My favorite scenes are with Winslet, Black and Wallach. However, the frustrating part of this hopeful film happens to be Cameron Diaz; she just doesn't shut up and grow; she is always in control, which makes the love story between her and Jude Law choppy and unbelievable. Whereas all the other major characters find themselves without constant dialogue.
B0068TL23G|2.0|Fun game but new permissions ensure that I will not be updating, and hence only 2 stars. Developer Getting greedy or what?
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|run out of energy to play very quickly and have to wait forever to get more or pay cash to get more. I'm not gonna keep spending money to play a game.
B007MJSYF0|1.0|After reading Battle Royale by Koushun Takami I decided to watch this movie thinking that if it were anywhere close to as good as the book it would be good.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  There were so many unnecessary changes and the acting was terrible.  Do yourself a favor skip this movie and just read the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|coolest game ever nice game its some of the games are<br />hard but really really FUN some of my other apps suck compared to to this one
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app I use it in church or in class so that I can take my notes. I then upload them and can post it to my blot it makes it so simple. Thanks for this wonderful creation :)

B00637TV1I|5.0|I stumbled across this album online, listened to a few samples and was impressed. I proceeded to buy the entire album, and I must say, WOW. The music hit me like a lightning bolt, BOOM. I was hooked. I cannot describe the way I feel about this music. I urge you to take a chance and purchase this album anyway you can! Also, all of their EP's!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|i used to like angry birds but i got bored of it. bht i never bered of this app. the only problem is the price.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I haven't read any fiction books since high school for assignments.  I read plenty, but only for facts.  Car and gun hobbies are expensive.  My wife said she wouldn't see the movie until she read the book.  I picked it up and put it in the cart for her.<br /><br />I downloaded the 3 pack on kindle [[ASIN:B004XJRQUQ The Hunger Games Trilogy]] and ran through them one after the other.  I can't really say anything bad because of how sucked in I was.<br /><br />The only real complaint is the fact that such young children were graphically killed and it bothers me on a human level.  Likely the idea of the book, push our feelings.  Done very well.  I'm not really into cheesy romance so the love part was amusing due to her being herself.<br /><br />The only complaint for the rest of the series at all is the graphicness increases, more children die, more civilians lost.  And then the final books \\"pre-ending\\" or where the last main action occurred, predictable.  That's all.<br /><br />I guess this was a successful start of a new cheap hobby while my expensive hobbies are on hold. :-)
B004EPYZXU|1.0|I kinda hated this movie.<br /><br />I remember going to the movies with a friend of mine a year or so ago. We saw a preview for what at first looked like an amazing movie: astronauts went to the moon, but they had a secret mission. When the cameras were off, they ran across the lunar surface to the...ruins! My jaw was open in amazement until I realized it was just a Transformer movie. I was so disappointed to see the concept wasted. So, then when I heard about Apollo 18, I thought someone had resuscitated the idea. Finally I'd get to see a movie maybe close to that first half of a preview which had blown me away...<br /><br />But this is not a good movie. First of all, I hesitate to call it a feature length film. The credits start rolling at 1 hour and 19 minutes. The plot is boring and slow and boring and also boring. It's also boring and it will bore you. Then it will make you bored. There are no surprises. You won't care about any of the characters. There are no interesting visuals or designs. Be careful what posture you watch the film in. You ARE likely to actually fall asleep.<br /><br />I really kind of want my money back. I feel conned after paying for this boring and short waste of a concept. Maybe I'll have to write a variation on this idea that has been wasted twice now if I ever want to enjoy the story I keep getting teased.<br /><br />I feel ripped off. Please wait until its on cable. Don't pay for this.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|This classic novel has a number of flaws that appeared in many novels back before we refined the art of exciting storytelling to a science. We take several chapters before we even meet Victor Frankenstein, and there is a lot of backstory told that isn't really needed. However, between the unnecessary exposition, there are many exciting and profound, and even emotional moments. Shelly went much further into character development than what I was expecting from what little I knew about the story - I knew the monster is misunderstood, but was not expecting the depth that is offered.<br /><br />The roots of modern sci-fi are found in books like this, and this should be considered a sci-fi classic. I also noticed hints of language and style that reminded me a lot of H.P. Lovecraft, particularly the descriptions of madness and angst, and themes of delving too far. Could it be that Lovecraft was heavily inspired by this novel? Possibly.<br /><br />A great book that should be part of anyone's repertoire if you wish to be functionally knowledgeable about literature and science-fiction.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|No one is more surprised, or more pleased, by the success of Adele than me.  Listening to the excellent \\"Chasing Pavements\\" for nearly two years, I wondered if she would ever be able to break through in America.  With the release of the monolithic \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" I was happy to see her continuing with good music, but figured America would give it a pass.  Boy, was I wrong!  The album 21 debuted in America and a few months later \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" cleared the top spot on the HOT 100.  It began to overtake nearly every genre of music, the kind of mainstream appeal no British artist could find in America since Leona Lewis' \\"Bleeding Love\\" three years earlier.  Suddenly Adele and her music were everywhere:  Tv appearances, a concert DVD, and every other commercial and promo.  Shows as disparate as \\"Rescue Me\\" and \\"The Lying Game\\" used her songs to promote their seasons. The second single, \\"Someone Like You\\", became her next number one hit and became the first ever piano-only ballad to hit #1 in America.  Third single, \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\", also hit number one and this album was the best seller in the country for more than 20 non-consecutive weeks.  It also led her debut album, 19, to an incredible second sales life and finally a boatload of Grammys.  Fourth and final single, \\"Rumour Has It\\", is impacting radio more than a year after the album's release.  This album, by Adele's own admission about a failed relationship, contains universal themes that have led to it being the best-selling album of its time, shift millions of copies in the digital age.  The album opens with \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", the biggest hit of 2011 and a towering single that brings to mind the classic Wall of Sound production associated with Phil Spector.  The accolades presented this song are many, and are deserved.  In a world of Autotune and 80s rip-off synthesizers, this song is Adele's voice, heart, and soul rather than a computer.  Simply put, amazing.  Track two is the current single, \\"Rumour Has It\\".  With its undeniable dream beats courtesy Ryan Tedder, this song tears into your brain like few others.  It managed to be a radio hit a year before its single release!  It is paired with the fellow Tedder tune, \\"Turning Tables\\".  This quiet song may be the most haunting of the album.  Its simple production complements Adele's vocals and renders the song truly special.  This is followed by the pleading \\"Don't You Remember\\", in which she implores a lover to remember everything they had together.  Next up is \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\", an oxymoron of a title reminiscent of \\"Melt My Heart to Stone\\" from her debut album. This track speaks to how many feel when betrayed; whether in love or life, the song is applicable to more than a few of us.  \\"He Won't Go\\" is a song in which she defends the similar positions of both herself and her lover, seemingly to a captivated audience.  \\"Take It All\\" finds Adele describing herself as a crumbling fool and it all works.  \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" is an unashamed promise to be better when her lover returns.  \\"One and Only\\" is perhaps the most unabashed love song here and is a thing of beauty.  The penultimate song here is an excellent cover of The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\", a song that very much fits in with the theme and spirit of the originals here.  The album closes with \\"Someone Like You\\", a quiet ballad that has deservedly become a massive hit.  With some of the most poignant lyrics to hit pop music in years, this song is certified to bring listeners to tears.  Even if Adele retired tomorrow, she has staked her place in the pop pantheon.  Hopefully listeners will get to hear music from her for years to come, and if we are lucky it will be just as amazing as what she's produced so far.<br /><br />Tommie Conrad, Author of \\"Windswept\\"
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game use it all the time to just kill time. got it as a free app glad I did.
0345803485|1.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, the writing here SUCKS. Stephanie Myers has a lot to answer for, namely a legion of formless, faceless heroines who have the personalities of yard mulch. Such is Ana. It's a complete mystery to me how this book or author are creating such an energetic literary buzz.<br /><br />Save yourself some hard-earned dinero and read Amazon's sample chapters. (I read them on my Kindle, but I believe they are also downloadable to computers and smart phones.) Reading three chapters of this book will tell you all you need to know.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|There are many other reviews that more eloquently explain why they only gave this book 1 measly little star.  I won't attempt to repeat what they have said about the lack of character development, depressing and rushed ending, or the barrage of endless murders...except to say that I agree with them 100%.<br /><br /><<<SPOILER ALERT!>>><br /><br />I loved the first book and most of the 2nd, but the author lost me the moment the arrow went through the chink (end of book 2).  From that point forward, Katniss became a confused and manipulated pawn who lost her ferocity and her morals.  She's a hot mess and who wants to read about THAT?
0345803485|5.0|After reading many other reviews, I thought I knew what I was getting in to. I know that some of the major complaints about the writing are:<br />She throws random British phrases out<br />There is repetitive use of words<br /><br />I agree whole-heartedly with both of these complaints. But, they didn't bother me until book 3. And I read all of them eagerly. I think book 2 was best and 3 was good at times.<br /><br /> One of the blogs called this trilogy, \\"mommy porn\\" and I would have to agree.<br /><br />The steamy scenes were HOT!! It brought me right back to the days....of novelty. The time of \\"firsts\\". I enjoyed this immensely. The email exchanges between Ana and Christain were my absolute favorite. I found myself laughing out loud many times.<br />Truth be told, if you are looking for a realistic love story, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for hot sex, funny interaction, and some decent filler plot thrown in..This books for you.<br /><br />Laters Baby.
B003O86FMW|3.0|In a trilogy, the first book (which was EXCELLENT!) sets up the story and the third book ends it.  This 2nd book is exactly what you should expect; a bridge between the two.  As a result, I wasn't expecting much out of book 2, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The author kept me hanging on with great twists and turns...that is, until the last chapter or so.  A few moments before the arrow flies, the book becomes confusing and hard to follow.  I understand Katniss was INTENDED to be confused in the end, but the author didn't find a way to rise above that for the reader.  So, while I really enjoyed the first 25+ chapters of a 27-chapter book, I have to give it only 3 stars.  Afterall, it's the ending that counts.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love doing puzzles I enjoy doing them they need to add more make them harder. u should get this if u love doing puzzles. they should have a app everything puzzles. they need to have of baby animals. I give it five stars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read a few 1-star reviews and agree with their points about the style of writing, etc.  However, I had no problem overlooking those things.  I found this to be an incredibly engaging and thought-provoking story that I simply couldn't put down.  I was afraid the brutality would be too much for my 10-year-old son, but halfway through I already knew he would love this book as much as I do.  It's a great read and you can't help but find similarities in our current society.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|I have be collecting Mercury Living Presence Cd's for years. I own a 80 of them. It cost me much much more than this collection. Of course I have enjoyed them for all these years. They are some of the finest sounding cds available. The individual ones do come in separate case with extensive note. But at about $10/ cd is what I paid. Still worth it for all the enjoyment I have had over the years. Some individual cds are still available at Amazon and other places. This compilation has the same cds without the individual case & notes. But to be able to buy them at one felt swoop at this price is truly amazing. BUY IT YOU WILL ENJOY THEM if you like classical music. Plus you get an amazing amount of high quality recordings at a cheap price. The sound quality of many will knock you socks off. My best & favorite cds. I Am considering buying as a back up, but I already have most of them.Plus you will have new music that will provide you many hours of truly amazing sound.<br />They are truly audiophile recordings.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|have watched many folks playing on their devises and wanted to try. Takes a few to get used to but a lot of fun
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My kids love to color and paint, so this is a great app to have available to entertain them, plus NO MESS!!  Well, except for all of the fingerprints on my screen.  The colors are great on the Kindle Fire and there are many drawing instruments and colors to choose from.  Very realistic.  I think my favorite part of this app has to be the paper choices.  You are also able to save your masterpieces.  Well done!
B006PTZNSY|4.0|I'm sure many people will claim that Nicki Minaj is a \\"sellout\\" or went \\"mainstream\\" with this release, just as they did when she released \\"Pink Friday\\" back in 2010. And there are a number of songs that are very poppy or very accessible to a large crossover audience on this new album. But Nicki Minaj is an entertainer, not just a rapper. And she delivers a hook-filled, fun album of summer anthems on \\"Roman Reloaded.\\"<br /><br />There really is something here for everyone, and while all 22 tracks on the deluxe edition of the album are not winners, there are a number of potential hit singles that will be blasting at clubs and on the radio all summer long. Right in the middle of the album, there are 4 songs that will likely be huge hits (\\"Spaceships,\\" \\"Pound the Alarm,\\" Whip It,\\" and \\"Automatic.\\") The first half of the album is mostly rap, which is hit-or-miss. Bypassing the awful track \\"Beez In The Trap,\\" there are some winners with \\"Come on a Cone\\" and HOV Lane.\\" The album closes with a gorgeous electro ballad titled \\"Masquerade.\\"<br /><br />Haters are going to hate, no matter what Minaj does. But nobody can make the claim that she did not try to branch out to a bigger audience, and that she did not play to her strengths here. She is a talent that is still a work in progress, still improving. But these hooks are just so catchy, and most of the raps are so smooth, it is hard not to enjoy this album. To some, it will be nothing more than a guilty pleasure. For others, the soundtrack to their summer of 2012. But if you like Minaj's last album, this is a slight improvement over the sytlistically similar \\"Pink Friday.\\"
B007BT0RKG|4.0|I love maps, so any app that has mapping capabilities I can get my hands on for free, I'll take it.  I use this on my Kindle Fire which does not have GPS (and yes, I did know that before loading this app), so it's hit or miss if it will truly find your location.  I believe it is able to find you according to your IP address.  Anyhow, it's an excellent quality map.  You can choose which states you want to load, so you can limit the memory this app takes up, especially on the Kindle Fire.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|This \\"PolyClock Wold Clock\\" app provides a very cool Day/Night globe clock and also displays the current time in cities around the world. It will also show the current location, allows you to add specific places, and supports setting alarms.<br /><br />The interface is fairly good once you get it figured out. The app installed and ran fine on my HTC EVO 4G.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I have always enjoyed Marilyn Monroe's films for the sheer joy of living and humor they usually imparted, and with a few exceptions she mostly did romantic comedies--but I was totally unaware of the truly unhappy person beneath the seemingly care free fascade.  If we are to believe this biographical piece about Marilyn Monroe's stay in England while filming The Prince and the Showgirl with Lawrence Olivier she was a miserable person who was insecure, manipulative, and proped up solely by drugs and alcohol.  Michelle Williams gives a convincing performance of the air-headed Monroe, and Kenneth Branagh does a good job channeling Lawrence Olivier with his dark brooding, quoting Shakespear,  and festering mid-life crisis.  The movie tells the story of Colin Clark who was desperately trying to break into the film industry in spite of his upper class families' chargrin.  Marilyn sees him as an innocent young pup that she can rely on to try to burry her sorrows and chastly worship her without trying to take advantage of her sexually.  Olivier and the people surrounding Monroe making the movie are green with envy and as Marilyn (her husband Arthur Miller fleeing back to the USA unable to stand the men buzzing around his wife like honey bees and her incessant collapses from drug and alcohol use)calls upon Colin again and again to escape the misery of her existence.<br /><br />Although a little before my time, I think the movie did a good job in portraying the 1950s.  I liked the film, felt the performances good, the only reason I'm giving the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is that I can't believe that Monroe was as stupid as she was depicted in the film.  I suspect that she was actually more calculating than portrayed here and that her passive aggressive behaviors that were only marginally hinted at in the movie, were actually probably much more pronounced in real life.  I don't believe anyone could have gone as far as she did in the film and modeling industry without knowing at least something about what they were doing.least something about what they were doing.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|Just want to start this off by saying I really wanted this to work well.  My daughter was born in the fall and when looking for a baby monitor, I saw the Withings unit and loved the concept, Issue was at the time it was not out yet.  As soon as I got the email in Jan that it was released for the US I bought the unit.  I didn't rashly post an immediate review since I hate when people do that, so this is now my reflection after a good 2 months of use.<br /><br />Unfortunately I tried every which way to fall in love with this product, but I did have to finally return it.  There are definitely a lot of positive aspects of the unit and the SW, but a few negatives that in the end of the day made me realize this product just isn't ready for prime time.  The biggest problem is that if the unit isn't near 100% reliable, its not worth the risk when dealing with an infant.  I found myself constantly running this monitor as well as my other monitor as a backup, which is not a long term solution.<br /><br />So very quickly after unboxing I was set up, that truly was a breeze.  You initially connect via Bluetooth, but then set up over WiFi.  Had the unit set up over 3 devices (Ipad, Iphone, and Ipod touch).  I eagerly awaited the first night to test this out.<br /><br />So first reactions and several positives:<br />1. Loved the way the app worked in the background.  It didn't tie up the device, or the battery, yet still notified you and let you hear the monitor<br />2. The trending, while limited to 15 minutes, was cool to see graphically the activity on the motion and noises<br />3. The history log as well was great to see the patterns that occur through the night, be great if this could also be graphed, but that's just SW App development<br />4. The temp and humidity monitoring were also good, this was the first unit I could find that did both along with having iphone integration.<br />5. The music and lights are really bells and whistles, I don't use them, but its added features<br /><br />Most of my cons are really product design and quality.  This wouldn't be the first time I saw a great idea, for a rather expensive product fail on product quality.  Rather upsetting, but also tells me there is no hope for it being fixed until a later release.<br /><br />1. The unit is basically a large clam shell.  Its actually even a bit bigger then I expected.  When you fold it up, you literally have to point it straight forward otherwise the base gets in the way of the image.  This literally cut out about 30-40% of my crib.  After one or two times of my child crying, but being out of view I had to change something.  I literally had to make a white finished wooden wedge with a rubber top and a Velcro strap to angle the entire withings unit down to capture most of the crib.  It was better, but you shouldn't have to do that for a $300 monitor.<br />2. The night vision is really sub-par.  Man nights it took squinting to see if the baby was on her back or her stomach.  Average would have been OK, but I didn't expect it to be substantially worse that run of the mill video units.  Again, for $300 why not beef this up.<br />3. I was actually able to deal with the first 2 issues, but #3 was the game breaker.  The unit is not stable.  It disconnects and buffers endlessly on occasion. This is not anything I was comfortable taking a risk on.  I'd say realistically it was about 5-15% of the time, meaning one morning every 1-2 weeks I would awake to find out that I was not monitoring my baby all.  Scary right?  Literally the application would say you have been disconnected with your monitor and could not be reconnected.  Some times the unit buffered and never would let you actually begin monitoring.  Not all the time, but enough for me to not take a risk of not having a monitor.<br />4. From my experiences above, I can also tell you there is no quick support resolution.  You cannot call the company.  You must email and get a response back anywhere from 1-5 days.They are helpful when you get them, but being in a different time zone it was at least a day to troubleshoot each step.<br /><br />To elaborate more on #3.  The unit has Bluetooth connectivity in case the WiFi fails.  This never is sustainable, even just one room away.  My router, the monitor and the device in most cases were withing 25 feet of each other.  I even tried the unit at someone else's house to see if its my network.  I ran into the same issues.  Sometimes shutting down the apps completely and relaunching helped, but I cannot do that when I'm sleeping!  Eventually I was simply told that it would not get better and I should return the unit.  Again, any other device, I'd chalk it up to being n early adopter and take the pros and cons, but with my child, there is no risks worth taking.<br /><br />I'm hoping this helps those on the fence and also gets some attention to look at the product quality.  Like I opened with, I truly wanted this to work as I love the concept and the features.They are helpful when you get them, but being in a different time zone it was at least a day to troubleshoot each step.<br /><br />To elaborate more on #3.

B00003CX8N|5.0|There are many excellent reviews of this film here, it's hard to know what to say in addition to them to convey just how delightful this film is. I've lost track of how many times I've watched it, it one of those films you go back to when your not sure what you want to see, when your mood is hard to define. It took a long time for me to work out why this film has such a hold on me, then 'the penny dropped' it's real life! Not the imagination of a talented writer of fiction, but the simply telling of something that actually happened to real people. It shows why the written word makes us so special, how humans can create a bond of friendship that can overcome distance and separation, that it can be possible to form a lasting, meaninful, bond with someone you've never met and lives thousands of miles away. Bancroft and Hopkins put in stellar performances, the story is allowed to tell itself in it's own time, at an appropriate pace. This is a film which restores your faith in humanity and makes you feel better just for investing a little bit of your time viewing it, personally I'd give it 10 stars if it were possible.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very unique. it has a twist on average games from the past. its great for on the go days.
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy was outstanding. The characters, the plot, the setting, EVERYTHING was outstanding about this book. Collin's is one of the most creative and interesting writers i've ever read. Reading The Hunger Games books was like looking into a whole different world, but it was earth, and it was just so detailed you began to believe The Capitol and The 12 districts were actual places. 5 stars!
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|While I will say that this was an excellent book, the ending is not what I was hoping for. I would have given this book a 5 star rating had the author not left everything open ended. So many things were left unanswered that I would expect another book but unfortunatley this was the end. I'm seeing a lot of the same review about the ending, maybe the author will take a hint and not leave things like this in her next trilogy.......or make it a series like it should have been.
B004FOA84A|1.0|At first I liked it,  but then couldn't get past the level after unlocking the hidden room. needed fuse and could not get the puzzles to work properly. the should refund everyone. horrible.
B0041B785Y|5.0|It seems Spring is upon us; fresh cut grass, blue skies, birds chirping, and of course the tuned-down 8 string assault of Meshuggah blasting through my quiet neighborhood from my car stereo. These Swedish titans of technical death/math/groove metal are back for their 2012 release, Koloss; a mind bending technical leviathan that snags you from the first riff and won't let go until its over. 10 songs ranging from the lumbering \\"Behind the Sun\\" the fast paced \\"The Demon's name is Surveillance\\" which has no musical rests, the headbanging \\"Do not Look Down,\\" the explosive track \\"Marrow\\" and the somber closer, \\"The Last Vigil.\\" This music is not for the feint of heart. It features harsh screaming, odd time signatures, and heavy distortion; however, if you're into that sort of thing (or are a Meshuggahnaut looking for what to expect from their latest) you will not be disappointed.
B0058VW36U|5.0|must get the app it is amazing and addicting it has like 10 different sets of 30 levels each.over all awesome.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|The music score on this CD is very uplifting.  It is mostly classical music. Perfectly safe for your teen or tween.  Loved the books. Loved the movies. Love the music.
B005EVVEPK|5.0|It's a jangly unique synthesis of genres.  It harkens back to The Byrds with the uplifiting jangly guitars and wonderful ballad singing which really stands out with 3 part harmonies.  There's often an insistent somewhat fast punk beat and punky to somewhat punky approach to the guitars.  It can be dark like punk and irreverant and fun and very catchy and pop-y like the Vaselines. It's also a bit like Best Coast.  And like Bluegrass, Veronica Falls can sometimes sing beautifully about things that are terrible in an such an ironically jubilant way.  Veronica Falls offers a unique synthesis of various genres with outstanding singing and very good musicianship and the result is very catchy and you may find your feet keeping the beat.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the options. Lots for my boys to choose from. I understand the need for all the ads but it would be nice for there to be less.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love all angry birds including this one the only thing that I don't like is that it only has 2 worlds they shouldn't have let the people buy it until they came out with more worlds. I love the game though :)
B005UBNKWO|4.0|I have seen reviews slamming these chips because of benchmark results. I upgraded from and overclocked triple core and this chip converts video at least 5 times as fast. Everything I throw at this, from a relatively normal user, is smooth and fast, virtually instant. I have a decent GPU but I was surprised to see that even Mass Effect 3 runs perfectly. For the money, there is no legitimate complaint.
B004V5QWU2|3.0|would give more stars if it didn't stop whenever it wants to. I put it on continuis and it stops whenever it wants. the lag in the loop kinda stinks to. I use it. it was only a dollar, what do you xpect.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is pretty epic. Really u just CHOP EPICLY LIKE A CRAZY PERSON WITH EXTREMELY EPIC GRAPHICS. It was one of the best games I ever played in my life. And anyway I'm only 10
B000MGUZM0|2.0|I'll keep the review very short for Neon Bible.<br /><br /> It lacks the tenacity of Funeral and the complete listening experience of the Suburbs.<br /><br /> This album sort of drags itself along, and it doesn't feature high moments of greatness. In turn, it's a steady, middling album that is never really that exciting.<br /><br /> The lyrics are good, and the songs have interesting themes, but I don't like the musical direction Arcade Fire chose this time around--sort of a cross between lo-fi rock and muddled experimentation.  In the end, it sounds very unpolished in a bad, \\"hey this really isn't working\\" kind of way. Though consistent in its sound, it's just not very appealing to me.<br /><br /> If I were to rank their albums, Neon Bible would be my least favorite.  That isn't to say it's terrible, it's just there, plodding along, not leaving much of an impression either way.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry it the beast game ever<br /> it is too cool. well to me it is we'll anyways I hope I l you like the game
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Its pretty fun you don't have to do to much and it is interesting. wish you could speed up waiting time so you could play more.
B003Y5H542|4.0|'Rango', directed by Gore Verbinski of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' fame, is not just another animated film as discussed in this self development review. Rango is a chameleon who has lived all his life in a glass tank. He has had numerous imaginary adventures with his only friends - a plastic toy fish, a dead insect and a broken doll. Due to unfortunate circumstances he finds himself outside of his 'glass cocoon', in a desert far from home. This is where his true life adventure begins.<br /><br />THE SELF DEVELOPMENT ANGLE<br /><br />The film touches on various issues such as the importance of natural resources, the class system, corruption, etc. I was particularly interested in the self development or personal development angle.<br /><br />Once Rango's glass home is destroyed and he is released into the real world, he has to cope in foreign surroundings for the very first time. He has many hard lessons to learn and he begins to contemplate who he really is and the true meaning of his life.<br /><br />He sets off on a journey of self discovery and changes from an insignificant chameleon to become a hero to many characters, dealing with personality crises and many insecurities along the way. He discovers finally who he really is and what he is truly capable of.<br /><br />If you watch the film with a self development mindset you will spot the motivational phrases and may well find yourself thinking about your own life and where you are heading. This is partly because the main character, Rango, comes across as very authentic and you feel for him as he goes on his journey of self discovery.<br /><br />WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR<br /><br />If you love Westerns you will enjoy Rango as there are lines and clich&eacute;s from the great cowboy films throughout. Although it is a Western aimed at adults, children will also enjoy it for its great animation and action scenes. However, it is not really suitable for very young children as it is quite dark, scary and violent in places with rather creepy characters.<br /><br />The animation is excellent - very detailed and quite spectacular. Some scenes are breathtaking. Overall the visual detail, lighting and colours are brilliant.<br /><br />THE DARK COMEDY<br /><br />Rango does not have a particularly deep plot but it is a clever film. The script is thought-provoking as well as very funny in places. The dialogue is witty with many of the jokes being directed more at adults. This is one of the reasons why adults will enjoy it as much as, or even more than, children.<br /><br />Although Rango is quite a dark comedy, it is also very touching in places. The basic story has various underlying tones associated with ecology, human personalities, etc. You can watch it on several levels. All in all, the dark humour is wonderfully quirky.<br /><br />THE CHARACTERS<br /><br />There are many weird characters in the film - not the cuddly type of other animated films but innovative creations with rather intriguing creature effects. They were uniquely created for the story and work well to give this film its dark edge.<br /><br />There is much visual detail in the film with each character having a unique personality. Some characters (like the Mexican Owl singers) appear at strategic points in the film which add to the creativity and humour. The various voiceovers are well chosen, especially that of Johnny Depp for Rango himself.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />As covered in this self development review, Rango is a chameleon who seeks purpose in life and goes from simply existing in his 'glass home' to becoming someone in a community who is respected for all sorts of reasons. With quirky dark humour, great animation and weird characters, this is definitely a film to see.er creepy characters.<br /><br />The animation is excellent - very detailed and quite spectacular.

B0073XORCY|4.0|This is a hard album to judge in any objective way. If you are a newcommer it may be hard to understand and yet most people who are likely to buy the album are also likely to think it should have never been made in the first place, for several different reasons.<br /><br />First of all, Jethro Tull's 1972 album Thick As A Brick is a beloved classic of the genre, that doesn't really need a sequel both because it worked on its own and because it was a deliberate send up of concept albums themselves. Besides that, the story of this sequel is about the life of the fictional writer of the previous album Gerald Bostock and not the lyrics of the actual album itself. Therefore in essence, this is more of a sequel to the album's artwork or meta-narrative than its narrative, which is a weird thought.<br /><br />Secondly, this album is not released under the same Jethro Tull band-name that the previous Thick As A Brick was. This situation is almost like Roger Waters releasing The Wall 2 as a solo album, which is another weird thought, and sure to cause confusion when filing. You could find yourself thinking too much about whether you file it as an Ian Anderson album, a Jethro Tull album or under a new category called `Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson.'<br /><br />Another point is \\"why now?\\" It has been so long since the first one. Ian's voice has changed so much, his playing style has changed so much and the music scene has changed so much. Surely Ian would know how defensive of the original everyone would be after this much time. No album will look good when it has to be compared to something that people have loved for decades.<br /><br />Finally, Martin Barre, who has been on every single Jethro Tull album ever, except their debut, is absent. The album is called Thick As A Brick 2, but doesn't have Martin Barre on board. This is arguably the weirdest thought of all, but then Ian wrote so much himself that you can understand his decision, even if you don't agree with it.<br /><br />With all those things stacked against it, some people will dismiss the album altogether and say that it should never have been made. However seeing as it actually HAS been made, the main question that people should be asking is how good is it?<br /><br />In my opinion it is actually pretty good, but only if you allow yourself to get really objective about it. It in no way lives up to its predecessor, but then no one realistically expected it to. It doesn't much sound like the original at all, more like a mixture between Heavy Horses, Chateau D'isaster and Dot Com.<br /><br />Tracks like `Shunt And Shuffle' are energetic and heavy, there is a mixture between tasteful moments (`A Change Of Horses'), humour and whimsical silliness (`Cosy Corner' and `Give Till It Hurts') and a lot of flute work, which is what I always like about most of Ian and Tull's work. Interestingly, the lyrics bring up A Passion Play and Locomotive Breath, make of that what you will.<br /><br />Structurally, the album does not follow the same formula as the original album, specifically it isn't just one giant song from start to finish, although as it is still a concept album it does flow together a bit more than just a standard album would. `Old School Song' actually sounds like the original album too and there are a few musical ques from the original; for example the album begins like the gap between sides one and two and the record ends with a completely unexpected reprise of the original albums `So You Ride Yourselves Over The Fields' bit, with the word `two' added on.<br /><br />There are these few connections with the original, in addition to the lyrics and artwork but in all actuality most of the material, for example `Wooten Basset Town' and `Upper Sixth Loan Shark' are much more like the last two proper Jethro Tull Studio albums, Roots To Branches and the aforementioned Dot Com. If you stripped away all the Thick As A Brick elements, it'd still be one of the strongest albums with Ian onit in years. Basically, If you like Ian's newer talking-vocals and the big power chords and mid paced songs that pick up for the solos, then this is going to be right up your street.<br /><br />If however you don't like Ian's solo albums or the sort of albums that Tull have been making since 1989's Rock Island, then there is a very strong possibility that this is not going to be something that you enjoy.<br /><br />Overall; if just being related to Thick As A Brick isn't enough for you, then maybe give Thick As A Brick 2 a miss. However if you do like albums like Dot Com and The Secret Language Of Birds, and if you don't feel too upset about the lack of Barre and the whole name situation, then by all means give it a shot. It is actually a pretty solid album with enough enjoyable songs to keep you interested, if you are willing to forgive its flaws.<br /><br />*** If you should buy the special edition, this version is housed in a double-digipak and comes with a booklet featuring linear notes, the CD and a DVD which contains alternative mixes of the TAAB2 album (but not TAAB1 in case you were wondering.) You can pick the audio of the album in a choice of formats: DTS 5.1, Dolby AC3 5.1 or 24/48 Stereo LPCM.<br /><br />Furthermore, this disc contains PDF files of the fake St Cleve site that this album uses as analogous to the original album's fake newspaper, as well as PDFs of the lyrics in various languages, a 15 minute making of video, a 15 minute interview video and a 20 minute lyric reading video in front of green screen backgrounds. Altogether, this is a neat DVD and is worth checking out if you can get the version for a reasonable price. ***it in years.

B006ZCWU5K|2.0|Not what I expected.  Somewhat depressing album, talking about the currect condition of the economy and people's despair....We hear enough of that everyday on the news and the current economic 'recovery' is very slow.  However, Bruce is a great musician and writer and always will be.  Land of Hope and Dreams and American Land give the album an uplift beat and reinforce American optimism.

0131480057|5.0|This book is single-handedly getting me by at my job that I am completely under-qualified for. (Shhhhhhhh).<br /><br />This majestic 600lb. instruction manual has gone everywhere with me since I got it. It feels good to hold, read, and absorb. The amount of info in here can make you lots of money once you master it. It has it all, and if it doesn't have it, it tells you where you can learn more. I know the authors here have been revising this book since the 70's, so you know they know their stuff. Reading this book while listening to Van Halen has really gotten me in the Unix Admin mode. Also a disclaimer, the authors also know how to make you laugh. Which looking at this intimidating book might seem impossible, but they are great.<br /><br />TL;DR. Buy it if you use Unix/Linux and make $$$.

B005723JSQ|5.0|\\"I've got your number\\" by Sophie Kinsella was a joy to read. It's laugh-out-loud funny! It's the cutest book I've ever read.<br /><br />Poppy loses her engagement ring and it's not just any ring, it's her fiance's family heirloom and she cannot find it anywhere. And luck was definitely not on her side that day, 'cause lo and behold, she also loses her cellphone that same day. One of those issues gets sorted out when she finds a cellphone in the trash. Now she can leave her number with the hotel management, where she lost the ring, so that they can contact her when they find it.<br />The phone she found belongs to wealthy business man Sam Roxton, and he wants his phone back!<br />This is a fun filled ride that will have you smiling along the whole entire way. Poppy and Sam are the complete opposites of each other, or so Poppy feels since she thinks she knows him through all the emails on his phone she's read. They grow closer through texting each other and very quickly become a part of each others life.<br /><br />I'd only read one other Kinsella book prior to reading this and they were both amazing! I'm officially a fan.<br />Kinsella writes with such ease, her characters are always so well developed and their personalities are always so amazing.<br />Poppy is the most lovable female book character ever! She was so funny and cute, I loved her.<br />Sam was also so likable. I loved the two of them together.<br />The element of comedy was inserted so nicely. I dare you not to smile while reading this book! I DARE YOU!<br /><br />I think only one word can sum this book up \\"Awwwww\\"!!!!<br />Yes, this book was so cute and funny and ... AHHH!! Just incredible! Read it, read it now.

B000UR9TQO|5.0|according to page when this was released, they were having an off night  i wonder what a excellent night for them would have been.  this was one of their best concert ever.  though when it comes to dvds, bootlegs like earl's court, knebworth, or their reunion fair a lot better.<br /><br />especially the one from knebworth, which was one of bonham's last performance, he plays as if his life depended on it.  it was kind of ironic that he played that night with all his might, and that would be the last official video released.  even though they are a lot older now, their knebworth far out weighed song remains the same.  it is too bad that they full knebworth and earl's court performance was never released in full officially.  regardless the video footages are a testimony that these four lads from england, wales, and scotland did not go down like a led ballooon, but flew as high as anyone could, and crashed landed in 1980.  along with the beatles, they are still revered as the greatest  rock band ever that walked the earth among the giants.
0345803485|1.0|I think that the other one-star reviewers have done a very good job of giving examples of the poor writing style (if I dare use the word \\"style\\" at all), so I won't repeat the usual complaints. It is baffling how this book has become such a big thing when there is nothing interesting, compelling, or groundbreaking about it. There are plenty of talented authors who have been around for many years writing erotic stories. Don't fall for the unwarranted hype on this one. This reads like a student writing assignment - like someone who is just learning how to write but still needs years (many years) of practice.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I must admit I was a little apprehensive at reading The Kite Runner's spiritual sequel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (ATTS), because many novels (and films) tend to have terrible sequels.<br />In my opinion, I actually found that ATTS was not only just as good as the first novel, but in some areas it is even better. The main characters have amazing chemistry, and this was done despite the awkward circumstances that brought them together. There were many plot twists where I almost cried. Like The Kite Runner, ATTS is an immersive experience, that will both teach you life lessons, have you hanging off the edge of seat, and cry, all at the same time.<br />Super duper heavily recommended.

B0020TS5LU|1.0|This review is of the Blu-Ray disc and not of the movie itself.  I liked Gosford Park so much that I ordered the Blu-Ray copy.  I ran the Blu-Ray disc on a 37 inch HD screen and it looked OK.  I also have a HD projector and 80 inch screen.  Every movie and every TV show in Blu-Ray that I have shown on the 80 inch screen have looked extremely sharp and clear.  Not this disc. It looked soft and almost out of focus. The company that did the transfer obviously felt nobody who bought this disc would have a large screen TV.  This Blu-Ray dics actually looked worse than some standard DVDs upscaled to 1080p.  Also there were NO SUBTITLES. Every DVD of movies and TV shows that I have ever bought has subtitles. It is a standard feature. Buying a DVD without subtitles is like buying an automobile without seats. Also none of the extra features that were on the regular DVD were on this Blu-Ray copy.  The Blu-Ray manufacturer, Alliance (Canada), is a disgrace for releasing such a joke of a Blu-Ray DVD. Maybe they buy cars without seats.
0143119680|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but it was confusing at times and I found myself rereading pages to try to understand something. It covers a lot of history but only a glimpse of a period at a time.  There is also a lot of characters and sometimes it takes a while to find out how they all connect especially when the characters are from the past.  Even with the confusing bits, I was able to skim over those parts and still retain my interest in the story.  It was a fun read and I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While was not able to complete the free Amazon sample without gagging at the striking similarities between E.L. Jame's Fifty Shades of Grey and Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, I would like to say that in the first 2 chapters, I learned the following:<br />~Anastasia is a slightly older, more awkward version of Bella (Proof: \\"Hair-behind-ear-tucking quirks,\\" Pale, Blue eyes, Brown hair, unfunny bluntness, an idiot mother, a father whose minority BFF has son who has a crush on her...Need I say more?)<br />~ Christian is Edward; (Proof: Brown hair, gray eyes, pale..., has a creepy desire to stare at women he does not know, cocky, well-dressed and wealthy, did I mention he stares?<br /><br />All in all, if Twilight makes you gag, as it does to me, reading this book will probably make you want to make you claw your eyes from their sockets, as it did me.

I don't like watching movies over and over again unless I really like it, and I don't buy a movie EVER unless I absolutly love it. Therefore after watching this movie I had to buy it. Girls you will love this movie. The actors are great in this movie, and I highly reccomend this one.
0345803485|4.0|**Contains some spoilers**This is the first book review I have done so I will try to just hit the high points and low points of the book.  I really did enjoy this book for what it was.  It's a fanfiction that gained enough popularity that the author changed some details and published it.  I've read a fair share of fanfiction in my day so I figured I would enjoy this book.  I wouldn't say I \\"enjoyed\\" it exactly, I was more addicted to it.  I couldn't put it down.  Overall, it's not very well-written and that takes some getting used to.  There are portions of it, mostly the sex scenes, that sound as if they were written by a twelve-year-old.  They are repetitive and brief and although I like the idea of the \\"virgin orgasm\\", I found the orgasms-a-plenty to be more distracting and far-fetched than anything else.  Aside from that, the story idea was intriguing.  I've never read a book about BDSM relationships so I found it informative.  The thing I liked the most was that this is a book you can just sit back and relax with.  It requires absolutely no neurons to digest the information.  Reading this book was a nice vacation for my brain in that I just didn't have to concentrate on anything, including the book.  All in all, I would recommend this book and think you'll enjoy it as long as you don't expect too much from it.  I plan on reading the next two books in the trilogy.
B005NQ94KS|5.0|This movie was not what I thought it would be. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but there were a few twists and turns in this movie. That being said I loved the movie.

I wasn't able to read the book before bed, but any other time I was totally absorbed by it. It is very addicting and you won't be able to put it down. The ending is abrupt and I was like, \\"What?

0385486804|5.0|The author of other classics such as Into Thin Air and Under the Banner of Heaven and a lifelong adventurer and essayist gave us his best when he documented the life and demise of Chris McCandless, aka \\"Alexander Supertramp.\\"<br /><br />This book recharges the human spirit the same way a fresh-squeezed glass of orange juice does a thirsty soul.<br /><br />Krakauer paints a portrait of a young man with a zest for living that most of us can only imagine, and gives us a detailed summary of his life leading up to his death in a bus parked in the Alaska wilderness.  And at the end of the book he even ventures to guess the reasons contributing to McCandless' death, and what his last days--of which toward the end there was painstakingly little detail--must have been like.<br /><br />In short, the book goes like this.  Chris McCandless is fed up with \\"life as we know it.\\"  He cleans out his bank accounts, gives what's left to charity, and goes out to \\"discover himself\\" and the world.  He drives across the American Southwest, then abandons his car and hitchhikes the rest of the way.  Along the way he meets a slew of interesting characters, but his final destination is Alaska, the Great Land.  He dies surrounded by the most  beautiful wilderness one can imagine.<br /><br />But first he paddles to Mexico and almost drowns in the Sea of Cortez.  He encounters onery border officials on his way back to the USA, but they let him in anyway, even though he didn't show his passport to anyone, not only because he didn't have one to show, but because there was no one to show it to as he crossed the border in a canoe through a concrete spillway that carried him into Mexico.<br /><br />But I won't tell you about his duet with nature from which he was doomed never to return.

I highly recommend trying them on at a store and if you see a better deal online, than purchase them online. But at Nordstrom, i tried on the 8 and the 8.5 my normal shoe size is 8. but these fit snug almost too snug...so after much debate, walking around in both sizes and asking the sales guy questions like if i got the 8 will it expand. and hes all not by much, just a little bit. folks take into consideration as well, if you wear them all day or during the warmer days and summer youre feet will swell, so if it feels snug while trying them on in your original size, go up half a size. they dont make your feet look too much bigger...go for comfort not for statement. the shoes alone are already trending around the country.
B004B4CM34|4.0|Colpire i mattoni non è la parte di questo 'lento al fuoco' il film thriller/romantico \\"L'americano\\". Riguarda assassino che passa attraverso la redenzione in una città tranquilla italiana (Monte di del di Castel) mentre facendo amicizia con un prete e facendo poi l'amore a una bella prostituta (Clara, giocato da Violante Placido). Andare nel combattimento potrebbe sembrare come il divertimento ma al nostro Jack di eroe l'armaiolo (ha giocato a-il-l'osso da George Clooney), non è molto alto sul suo elenco. Ha ucciso appena il suo Ingrid di amante (giocato da Irina Björklund) e deve vivere con la sua coscienza. La nostra empatia potrebbe essere legata al suo `soul che ricerca', poiché non capiamo perché ha dovuto uccidere Ingrid indifeso. È lanciato nell'abisso di colpa e nel rimorso. Il complotto addensa.<br /><br />Il cricco vuole fuori da degli affari; dice il suo capo che va nell'isolamento e non ritornerà alla sua professione di `killing per un prezzo'. Facendo così, Jack fa scendere la collera del datore di lavoro rigettato su sé. Sa questo. Presume un'altra identità. Confida al prete locale (giocato da Paolo Bonacelli), \\"non penso che Dio sia interessato molto in me, il Padre\\". Cerca essere anche pulito della sua colpa dormendo con il nostro `Mary Magdalene' l'eroina. Alzare ora morirà per proteggere Clara da qualunque danno; è la sua guardia del corpo ed il suo amante. Ha cambiato il corso della sua vita attraverso la sua influenza su lui. In tutte le considerazioni, Clooney è fresco, riservato, tranquillo, intenzionale, metodico e tenero con i caratteri di donne inizio anteriore di finire. È anche protettivo di un assassino di donna (Mathilde, giocato da Thekla Reuten), che è inviato a ucciderlo. Misericordiosamente, le dà ogni probabilità per indietreggiare e rifiutare il contratto sulla sua vita. Vuole la sua vita (Mathilde) di essere risparmiato come bene. Ha una coscienza ora e ci identifichiamo con lui - non un assassino freddo-insanguinato ma poiché un uomo cambiato da dentro. Ha \\"scoperto\\" ciò che importa più a lui come un uomo di coscienza.<br /><br />Queste ironie drammatiche - il lato sensibile generoso al nostro girato da assassino-eroe e la maniera precisa costruisce un Ruger Mini-14 soppressore per la pistola ha significato essere usato contro lui - ci consente poiché un pubblico piacere un italiano-americano rifa di \\"Le Samourai\\" (francese, 1967, ha il ruolo principale Alain Delon come l'assassino in un complotto simile, redentore; difendendo anche una donna) e \\"Sumarai io, II, ed III\\" (giapponese, ha il ruolo principale Tishuro Mifune Come lo \\"spadaccino moralistico principale\\" che difende l'onore e le donne con la sua vita).

B00111YM5G|5.0|I like a lot of non mainstream movies like this on. I liked Priest which most people thought was terrible.<br />This movie has a good plot and a lot of insight into human feelings.<br />If you want a movie that will impress you with world class acting and special effects, you may not like it. Stick with big name movies if that's all you want.<br /><br />If you like a movie where you can look beneath the surface and relate with the characters in the storyline, this is worth looking into.<br /><br />It sends the message that it doesn't matter who you are and what you've done, you can always fall victim to the things that will lead you away from God. But then it also shows that no matter how far you move away from God you can always find your way back and even the consequences you may pay for being on God's side.<br /><br />Despite all the reviews about the logic and trying to explain what the \\"cycles\\" are and the angels and fallen assuming human forms, it become relevant when they start to address emotions they begin to feel. One of the archangels referred to anger, hate, and fear as \\"things we never knew existed\\" and \\"no one told us it would be this hard.\\" There is one scene in particular when Gabriel gets so mad his eyes briefly change from blue (the color of the archangels) to brown (color or the fallen) before changing back.<br /><br />I didn't find it excessively violent compared to most movies today (there is a lot of generalized violence, fighting, beating, some blood spray in shooting scenes...etc) but not anywhere near like in 300.<br /><br />And as far as the \\"how can God not know what happens in Purgatrory?\\" comment first off.....it's a movie. Also a lot of people will tell you that sometimes there are places where you don't feel God's presence because all the evil feels so overwhelming.<br /><br />****Potential Spoilers****<br />And as far as what happened to Micheal, I'm sorry but it was not clear. There was a reference by Uriel to a surge of power when he fought Samael and then nothing.<br /><br />And the ending was not overly obvious outside of just knowing that the good guys win.<br /><br />I would have liked a little more closure in the movie as far as seeing what happened after the fight between Samael and Gabriel. All you know is good guys won.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Hitting the bricks is not part of this 'slow to the fire' thriller/romantic film \\"The American\\". It is about an assassin going through redemption in a quiet Italian town (Castel del Monte) while making friends with a priest and then making love to a beautiful prostitute (Clara, played by Violante Placido). Going into battle may seem like fun but to our hero Jack the gunsmith (played to-the-bone by George Clooney), it is not very high on his list. He has just killed his lover Ingrid (played by Irina Björklund), and has to live with his conscience. Our empathy may be tied to his `soul searching', as we do not understand why he had to kill defenseless Ingrid. He is thrown into the abyss of guilt and remorse. The plot thickens.<br /><br />Jack wants out of the business; he tells his boss that he is going into seclusion and will not return to his profession of `killing for a price'. By doing so, Jack brings the wrath of the rejected employer down on himself. He knows this. He assumes another identity. He confides to the local priest (played by Paolo Bonacelli), \\"I don't think God's very interested in me, Father.\\" He even seeks to be cleansed of his guilt by sleeping with our `Mary Magdalene' heroine. Jack will now die to protect Clara from any harm; he is her bodyguard and lover.<br /><br />He has changed the course of his life through her influence upon him. In all regards, Clooney is cool, reserved, quiet, deliberate, methodical, and tender with the women characters from start to finish. He is even protective of a woman assassin (Mathilde, played by Thekla Reuten), who is sent to kill him. Mercifully, he gives her every chance to back away and turn down the contract on his life. He wants her life (Mathilde) to be spared as well. He has a conscience now, and we empathize with him - not as a cold-bloodied killer but as a changed man from within. He has 'discovered' what matters most to him as a man of conscience.<br /><br />These dramatic ironies - the sensitive caringside to our assassin-turned-hero toward three highly feminine women (with completely different personnas) and the precise way he builds a Ruger Mini-14 suppressor for the gun meant to be used against him - allow us as an audience to enjoy an Italian-American remake of \\"Le Samourai\\" (French, 1967, stars Alain Delon as the assassin in a similar, redemptive plot; also defending a woman) and \\"Sumarai I, II, and III\\" (Japanese, stars Tishuro Mifune as the moralistic 'master swordsman' defending honor and women with his life). Clooney works well with women in strong roles, and this elevates the film substantially. All unities adhered to.<br /><br />At times the movie is so low-key, it becomes an exercise in tranquility. Directed by Anton Corbijn; original novel by \\"A Very Private Gentleman\\" by Martin Booth; screenplay adaptation by Rowan Joffé. Has serious erotic scenes that may or may not offend viewers.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I LOVED this game when I first got it on my Epic phoal but after beating all the levels and unlocking the ability to play any level I want, it froze to the point that I had to take out the battery on my phone, and I had to start all over.<br /><br />My favorite part of my favorite game is the bowling game.  So in order to play my favorite part, I had to go through all the levels again.  Not such a big deal except I've had to start all the way back at the beginning at least three times.<br /><br />When Plants vs Zombies 2 comes out, I sure hope they expand on the bowling by making it harder or having more levels.  Also, if there's still the freezing problem, at least make it so that I play the fun levels over and over earlier.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't write a lot of reviews, because even though I read them here on Amazon, I don't see why anyone would care so much about what I thought about it. Also--there are usually so many reviews already, what's one more?<br /><br />But I had to write this one. The Wool Omnibus is easily one of the best things I've read in the past year.<br />Well amazon took out my external link, but my Blog's name is Erstwhile Dancefloor Revolution and I have an entry on April 2nd 2012, called B is for Bibliophagist which has pictures that establish my cred as a reader :-P<br /><br />Ok, that's done.  I have read reviews for the family circus and Three Wolf moon shirts, so when I read the reviews for Wool, I thought I'd landed in another one of those. They were all uniformly rapturous. I didn't believe them.<br /><br />So I downloaded a sample. And forgot about it for a bit.<br /><br />Then one day when I got the chance to take a long bath with my kindle I randomly chose that one. I'd just finished  Water for Elephants and wanted to go back to my native country of Science Fiction.  So I clicked on Wool.<br /><br />And started reading the sample and couldn't stop. What's more as I noticed the bar creeping closer and closer to the end I felt a bit frantic. What, NO it was going to end already?<br />And I got to the end and thank god it was just a sample. I immediately turned on the wireless and bought the entire thing. Because you should pay this man. This book is easily worth twice what I paid--and really? I get a bit ticked paying 12.99 for E books, because well--they are just more ephemeral. But the Wool Omnibus is worth that easily.<br /><br />And after I finished it, I was sad. I wanted more, so I bought two more of Hugh Howey's books. And I'll be buying more too.<br /><br />If you don't buy this book you are missing out on something brilliant. You will become part of each character, you will live where they live and feel what they feel. You will believe every moment and feel sorrow that Wool doesn't go on forever.ow that Wool doesn't go on forever.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The author has succeeded in creating a rich, new world. I enjoyed the method of story telling as well as the development of the main character. Many of the other characters are painted with enough light to give them life, but are clearly secondary to the protagonist. There are echoes of Harry Potter that last for moments in the brain as Kvothe sets out for University and undergoes some of his trials and tribulations, including a difficult headmaster, challenges with a girl, and two less developed friends.<br />These are easily overcome by the well-written story, the way the author ties in different elements together, and his ability to simply describe a scene.
B007C1394E|5.0|Viewers who are new to this show need fair warning - once you watch the first episode of Season One, you will be hooked! Fortunately, this series runs for four seasons ( although I consider it a great pity that they ended it after only four seasons). Lark Rise to Candleford: Season One is a charming series that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel.<br /><br />In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha who was also brilliant in her role as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, the 1996 version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as the two leads). Ms. Lane is related to Laura's mother Emma (Claudie Blakley), and the position is a coveted one. Tensions have always existed between the residents of snooty Candleford and the more humble villagers of Lark Rise. When Laura is apppointed as assistant postmistress, she meets with prejudice from the Candleford residents, such as preachy postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap), town dressmakers the Pratt sisters, Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who love prying into others' business, and many more.<br /><br />The residents of Lark Rise meanwhile are a down-to-earth bunch of people - there's Laura's father, Robert (Brendan Coyle, who eventually leaves the series to join the cast of another period drama, Downton Abbey), a man of strict principles; the beloved older couple, Twister and Queenie Turrill who delight viewers with their rather unconventional relationship (it is Queenie that mostly provides for them, she is a sort of healer/ wise woman whilst the slightly unbalanced and eccentric Twister spends his time loafing around); young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh), who struggles to keep his family afloat due to an irresponsible mother and an absentee father; and, many more.<br /><br />Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire and childhood sweetheart, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful yet unfulfilled Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant).<br /><br />In this first season, viewers get to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out. The acting is top notch and the writing is one of the best I've seen on period dramas. The ensemble cast is simply magnificent and the storylines are multi-layered, developing the characters and addressing social themes pertinent to the time period. This is a beautifully-filmed period drama of the highest quality, and I heartily recommend it!discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements.

B001VIMCW4|4.0|I have to say, I really liked this movie.<br /><br />It's certainly nowhere near as good as Casino Royale, but it is a triumph of style over substance.<br /><br />The first time I sat through this movie, I could not help thinking of the old spy movie - the Ipcress file with Michael Caine. Quantum of solace not only feels like the Ipcress file, but its dazzling editing and camera angles makes it a relative of Caine's earlier (and close to Bond) movie.<br /><br />Some of the stand out sequences were the car chase, and the fantastic opera scene. I also liked the labyrinthine plot. You can't help but get lost in the story, but somehow it just about manages to come together at the end.<br /><br />In short, if you love the Bond novels - then you will love the toughness, brutality, and style of Quantum.

B000SW2F6M|4.0|Ridley Scot did it again! After his previous peplum, he has come up with a story about honor and faith which takes place during the time of the Crusades and mostly in the Kingdom of Jerusalem just before and during the year 1187, when the Kingdom's army was destroyed and the Holy City was surrendered.<br /><br />The costumes, arms and armour are perfectly accurate for both sides and the main events - including Saladin's assault on Kerak (they were several) are also there. Scot has however taken liberties with the characters. Reynald de Châtillon and Guy de Lusignan were never Templars, although Reynald, forever defiant, was killed by Saladin's own hand after being captured at the Horns of Hattin, as shown in the film. If Guy had been one, he could never have married Sybille (played by Eva Green), the sister of the Baldwin IV, the Leper King. I wasn't too impressed by the actor playing Guy. Tiberiade (wonderfully played by Jeremy Irons), is a fictional character based on Raymond III Count of Tripoli and Lord of Tiberiade through his wife. The real character was at one time regent of the kingdom and was one of the main contenders of Guy de Lusignan, Reynald de Châtillon and the Grand Master of the Temple - Gerard de Ridefort (not included in the film's cast).<br /><br />Balian d'Ibelin (a very convincing Orlando Blum), and the Ibelin family, really existed and Balian defended Jerusalem with such determination that Saladin gave him terms, although not all of the population were granted such terms - only those who could pay their ransom. Balian was not the bastard son of the lord of Ibelin. He was perfectly legitimate, and so was his brother. Both were born in Outremer and the Ibelins were and remained throughout the XIII century, one of the main noble families in Outremer. The romance with Princess Sybil is, of course, necessary fiction: a must for this kind of film although it is true that Sybil was married at 14, which was what happened at the time, and not exactly consulted.<br /><br />But nevermind historical accuracy: the film is superb and exciting. The battle scenes, from the first skirmish in France to the assaults on Jerusalem, are very realistic. The near-suicidal charge of Balian and his knights at one against thirty or fourty to give time to the poor and the defenceless to take refuge in the Krak is based on another charge and battle, this one historical. It took place in 1187 at the Springs of Cresson and where some 150 knights, including some of the best from the Hospitallers and the Templars (including the Temple's Marshal and both Grand-masters), and some 500 foot attacked an advance-guard of some 6000. The Franks were, unsurprisingly, wiped out with only Gerard de Ridefort (who had urged the attack) and a handful of knight escaping alive from the battlefield (but not the brave Marshal of the Temple).<br /><br />Hugely entertaining and worth a good 4 stars. If you like films based on history (here the Crusades) and adventure stories with a lot of noble feelings anf high spirits (like I do!), you'll love this one.onsulted.<br /><br />But nevermind historical accuracy: the film is superb and exciting.

B005TQAI6G|2.0|I had the opportunity to attend Britney's concert in Chile in november, and I loved it... I had been waiting to see her in concert for 13 years, and it was just one of the best concerts of my life, and the one I paid the most to see. It was pure energy for 90 minutes, plus the fact that she did sing live in a LOT of the songs (not all of them), it was a fantastic concert. Well, after seeing her in concert, I got the DVD and was expecting to be amazed by the show one more time, but this is just a HORRIBLY made DVD.<br /><br />Where to start..<br /><br />1. The cameras are WAY too static and barely move and follow Britney and the dancers, it just makes it really boring, plus the angles are really bad, they're filming from above the stage, which just makes it look small, it's like watching a security camera footage! When you capture a live concert you want to get the excitement and the greatness of the stage and effects... Fail! Bottom line: the director should never work again and probably killed!!<br />2. The editing also plain sucks... I know my stuff since I go to film school, and whoever post-produced this concert was absolutely stoned or it was their first day at the job. The cuts are completely out of time, it just a visual mess they've created.<br />3. Dubbed vocals. For the first time ever (and I'm a huge Brit fan) I am 100% sure that she DOES sing live. The un-dubbed version of this concert was leaked and posted on YouTube and you can really tell the difference, but Epix, for some stupid reason, decided it was a good idea to replace ALL the vocals with the studio versions. Knowing that Britney sang live at the actual show, and that she is heavily criticized for her lipsyncing, it would have been amazing to hear her live vocals on the concert DVD.<br />4. The back cover looks like it was made by a 5 year old (not offending any 5-year olds!), the color is nowhere near similar to the ones used on the front cover or the Femme Fatale CD artwork. I have seen a billion fanmade covers online that are way prettier!<br />5. And finally, but not less important... \\"Leather And Lace\\" on the menu.. instead of the actual name of the song, \\"Lace And Leather\\".... REALLY?? This is Britney's second DVD with wrong song titles! You would think that for a release as anticipated as this one there would be some sort of Quality Control process... I guess not.<br /><br />Having YouTube and my own recorded HD videos from the show I attended, I just prefer watching something else to remember this tour, to watch it and get excited and wanting to jump in my room. I just don't watch this DVD anymore. It's nowhere near as exciting and energetic as the \\"Live From Las Vegas\\" or \\"Live And More\\" DVDs.<br /><br />Look for this concert on YouTube. If you see it and are satisfied with it and actually like it, then buy it. Honestly, I would have skipped it.ion fanmade covers online that are way prettier!<br />5.

0545101425|3.0|If you have not read the first two books in the series recently, you should go back and review them or you might find yourself adrift for awhile. I read both in 2009, which put me at a disadvantage. The author does not do a good job of orienting the reader with subtle hints or memories of the first two books, so often, the reader will be confused about what is being discussed, or what is happening, or about some of the characters and the parts they played. They are only reviewed in the most superficial of ways. Like the other two books in the series, violence is no stranger. The characters do not seem to have matured from their experiences and although this is an excellent endeavor in science fiction, this book is the weakest link in the group. Katniss seems to have an unrealistic nine lives, surviving and escaping, again and again, when everyone else succumbs. She fights to kill her peers but then balks at killing her enemies with righteous indignation.<br />After a failed people's revolution, the dystopian society of Panem, formerly North America, is ruled by the powerful residents living in the community called The Capitol where the power resides. Using the 12 slave communities to provide their needs, all things of value are at their disposal. The 12 communities, however, live in poverty, hand to mouth, without either many creature comforts, proper shelter or enough food to sustain them, except minimally. Each year, The Hunger Games are staged by The Capitol, as a reminder to them never to revolt against the authorities again. In the Hunger Games, two children from each community are pitted against each other in an arena in which they must all fight to the death, until there is only one survivor, in staged settings of horror and death.<br />This is a violent and bloody novel, horrific in the nature of the destruction, injuries and cruelty toward others, that it describes. Reading this final book, made me wonder why parents would allow young children to even read it. The concepts are too far above the emotional and mental maturity of a 10 year old, and yet many have been allowed to read it in order to feel cool, \\"in\\", and to make themselves and their parents pseudo-sophisticates, after all, they are all bright enough to read this book, originally designed for young adults, defined variously as 10-20 and 12-17. One surely has to realize that the age range is too broad and parental guidance should play a major role before such a book is placed in the hands of a 10 year old, and yet they are even reading it with their parents' blessings. How can the same concepts be appropriate for a ten year old and a twenty year old? It defies common sense.<br />This book gave me pause as I realized that we \\"hunger\\", to use the author's phrase, for such tragic and monstrous plots and then expose them, perhaps irresponsibly, to our young. What are we teaching them? Why do we want to them read this, creative and well written, as well it might be? What do we all hunger for? Do we want a form of escape or is it a form of wishful thinking? Do we want revenge; is it about class warfare; is it about fairness; is it about power? Whoever possesses it, is the winner, so perhaps, it is not really about righteousness and survival and a restructuring of David and Goliath, at all? Perhaps as Lord Acton (1834-1902), British historian, originally wrote:  it is about the fact that \\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad man.\\" I thought that both adults and youths set a terrible example in this book. They all seemed self-serving and headstrong, thinking of nothing but their own needs, ultimately. That is a terrible lesson to teach the future of America.<br />I realize that this review may make me sound a bit condescending, but I don't feel that way. I feel genuinely sad that our children are being forced to grow up before their time, to read books inappropriate for them when there are so many wonderful stories out there without blood and gore that have just as much adventure and excitement. There are wholesome stories that reinforce healthy family and community values. It makes me wonder, is it any surprise that we have so much violent crime against each other, student against student, spouses against spouses, parents against children, so many random unexplainable killings? What example are we setting for them with our films and modern literature?<br />I used to think inappropriate sex, which has become so prevalent in books to entice readers, was the problem, but I see it is more complex than that. Today, it would seem that anything inappropriate is deemed worthwhile if it gets readers interested, no matter what the future consequences may be. I am a bit surprised that Scholastic Inc. has promoted this for the young.tories out there without blood and gore that have just as much adventure and excitement.

Its so distracting becasue A) nobody ever murmurs, seriously and B) NO ONE EVER MURMURS!!!!!  UGH!  I hate it so much.  I've never read a book where characters are at lunch or walking down the street or anywhere but in bed and they are murmuring all over the place.  Its so dumb!  I could be into the subject matter or the guy, (Christian reminds me of my own boyrfiend. Not the billionare part or the S&M but the distant controlling good looking part.

B005QJZ5FA|2.0|One of those artists where after a few minutes all the songs run together and start to sound the same.  Very generic.  She didn't stretch her abilities at all on this album, just sang within a very tight range and beat that vocal horse to death.  Cheaper to buy a single and just play it a dozen times.  Same thing.  If you like that kind of song, great, because that's all she's going to give you.  I prefer an artist with range.  She's a pretty face that can sing a few notes.  As long as she stays in the studio and no one asks her to do anything new or difficult, she'll make lots of money.  At this point, she's going to have trouble catching up to Britney Spears in the talent category.  Not good.  Maybe she's just holding back.  If so, wait for the next album.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|Even though the author tried to convey Elizabeth and Darcy as did Jane Austen, it did not work for me. Of course people change but the characters seemed cold, lacking in depth and rather boring. I did not feel that way about Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea but I think Jane Austen's work is best left alone. I have read a few other things where authors have tried to utilize Austen's work but they did not work either. I think that Austen's success was that she wrote about what she knew and she was not willing to expand in a direction that some thought she should have. Had Austen lived a long life, who knows to what level she would have evolved?
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Following the story line is certainly difficult, but the navigation is satisfying in the end.  Yes, it is too much to attempt to condense the book into a 2-hour movie.  And the first time through one feels like \\"well, SOMEBODY had to be the perpetrator\\".  But additional viewings allow one to see the clues, and how Smiley got there.  Great movie, with a greater impact on giving an atmospheric feel for the horrible life of a spy, rather than for story telling.<br /><br />Much more than a depiction of the spy world, the work constitutes a realistic tale of the convolutions, confusion, and prevarications ensuing from little evils in people's lives that develop into monstrous damage.  Just like real life.  The novel's very last chapter, number 39, puts the entire work in fruitful, illuminating perspective for me.  Not to be read until reading the entire preceding novel.  It is amazing to realize how certain little things convolute into immense damages translateable to one's personal world. An unwitting cautionary tale by way of am eminent spy thriller.

B0040T7B2M|4.0|The music on this album is absolutely phenomenal, an excellent blend of slow songs, upbeat songs, and in between. If you're a fan of Belle & Sebastian, this is a must have.<br /><br />The Vinyl itself is pretty thin, so if you have an old/worn record player, you might need to upgrade as it's prone to skipping due to the thin size of the disc. I bought a new one player, $50, and it works well now.<br /><br />Comes with digital download with two bonus tracks, so it's an excellent value.
B003KGBISY|5.0|Seven Samurai is among the greatest and most influencial movies of all time.  Its plot has been much imitated, including the western remake as \\"The Magnificent Seven.\\"  It masterfully deals with plot elements like friendship, caste distinctions, heroism, and a disappearing way of life.  If you've not seen it, you must.<br /><br />If you have seen it, the Criterion Blu Ray edition is the one to have.  The visuals are remastered, looking as pristine as any movie lover could desire (some artifacts and dirt remain, but such are unavoidable).  The sound is great, and the presentation, extras, and packaging are worthy of display.<br /><br />Get this one, you won't regret it.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I wasn't expecting this amazing collection of songs when i picked this up.  This is Madonna and she isn't holding back.  If you don't pick this up, your missing out on what are soon to be classics of her. 5 stars for singing. Just a short one this time, thank you for your time, pick this up now.  P.D.
0553382179|4.0|I follow the FLYLADY e-mails and her web site.  I've ordered several products from her, so I thought...why don't I have her book?  It's still housework, but she turns the attitude around into \\"home blessings.\\"  She is very enthusiastic, up-beat with a terrific positive attitude.  Her book has inspired me even more to keep my head up and my shoes on.  I'd give the book 5 stars, but, it's still housework.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Reading other reviews I felt like this story would be fascinating and enthralling. On the contrary I found this story boring, sophomoric and on the brink of trashy porn. The characters are ill defined and shallow.  The sexual escapades abound and every other page is littered with some unrealistic sexual antic. I wish I had read a sample first . I would not have purchased this title and I will not read the other two books in the trilogy. I was very disappointed.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I've been watching Breaking Bad since it first aired, and while it took a while for it to reach this point, I can honestly say that season 4 was when this show became, quite possibly, the greatest TV show on air.<br /><br />Allow me to explain. Breaking bad's writers have always been great in crafting episodes. The pre-credits scenes, the dialogue, the character building, the intense feeling of dread and hopelessness at points, and watching a mild mannered high school chemistry teacher slowly turn into a drug kingpin, all make for great television. Butthis season took it to a new plateau.<br /><br />By introducing Gus Fring as the antagonist to Walter White (loosely speaking of course, because the very idea of antagonists and protagonists has absolutely no meaning on this show), breaking Bad managed to create a thrilling cat and mouse game. By the end I was not sure who to root for, which really goes to show how well the writers planned this season.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of The Wire, Sopranos, and Deadwood, but I now believe Breaking Bad to be better than those. My personal opinion of course, but I felt the characters on breaking Bad are more realistic, and react to situations as normal people would. It felt so strange for me to watch the pilot again after having finished the fourth season. So much has changed. And for the better.<br /><br />This show is how modern crime drama/thrillers need to be done. The writers balance action and characters flawlessly to make compelling TV. Can not wait for Season 5, which I hear is the final one.
B007DIQB50|5.0|I think its funny how people say Nicki \\"sold herself out to pop\\" when even BEFORE she was famous she was rapping about how she wanted to do rap AND pop on an album but her labels always said the public wouldn't understand it. It's in her song \\"Can Anybody Hear Me\\". So no Nicki didn't sell herself out... her label finally let her do what she wanted since she made a name for herself.<br /><br />I love this album its very catchy! My stand out favorite is \\"Marilyn Monroe\\". I love songs that Nicki strips down and gets real. Reminds me of \\"Dear Old Nicki\\", in a way. Great mix of pop and hip hop. I couldn't see anyone else pulling this off.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun. really love the games. my kids enjoy playing the games also. thank you. will tell my friends and tam to play also.
1612130283|1.0|Okay - full disclosure.<br /><br />I love well written books.  I love well-plotted books.  I love strong heroines I can admire and empathise with.  I enjoy well written BDSM and complex relationships between well written three-dimensional characters.<br /><br />I also have a friend who thought it would be hysterically funny to give me this book as a present.  On 1 April.<br /><br />This book is badly written.  The sex scenes are inadvertently funny - I am not supposed to giggle during a dom/sub scene.  The knowledge of BDSM bounces from knowledgable comments (lifted from BDSM sites?) to the impossibly silly.<br /><br />Obviously I did not waste time finishing this book.  I wonder if I can re-gift it next April.<br /><br />If you loved Twilight you will probably love this book.  If you thought Twilight was well-written, you will remain blissfully unaware that this is bad writing.  If you think Bella is a character to admire, you will probably admire Anastasia.  If you don't know much about BDSM, the inaccuracies and silliness of some of the BDSM scenes will not bother you.<br /><br />On the other hand: If you snicker every time somebody tries to claim that Twilight was well written, you should avoid this book.  If you cannot abide vapid characters like Bella, you should avoid this book like a plague. If you know anything about BDSM and ignorance on that topic annoys you, do not buy this book!  (Unless you want to send it to a friend as a prank.)<br /><br />I will give the author credit for one thing.  Unlike some of the self-pubbed authors on Amazon, she did not spend all her time and effort grooming just the first few chapters and paying editors to polish her prose into something readable.  She did not, in short, provide \\"sample chapters\\" that conned buyers into thinking her entire book was written at a higher standard than it was.  I have read the sample chapters provided for this book - they are written at the same standard as the rest of the book.  Whatever I maythink of her writing or her characters, this author is honest about her writing ability and refuses to trick people into buying something they would not enjoy.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone over the last few years who kept telling me to read these books, was right, and I was wrong.  There, I said it:)  I put it off forever because I just didn't find them appealing, however, once started I could not stop.  Sat up very late reading book one--and was so happy I had my Kindle for instant gratification in purchasing book 2 and book 3.  Excellent, action packed, stories--sorry I waited so long:)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|more fun than you would think and pretty addictive. its kind of like Tetris but notreally.  Does that even make sense? Lol
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutly loved this book. I started reading it out of curiosity then I found myself so lost in the story is was up until 1:30 in the morning reading and having to force myself to put the book down and go to bed. I have not read romance novels regularly since I was a teenager but if this author is able to continue writing like this I will continue reading them. I was so stuck in this story I could not wait for the next book and I read all three in five days. Looking so forward to the next book and would like to read more of the story from Christian's point of view. The glimpse at the end of book three was great.

B007FH9GT2|4.0|1st off I want to say that I haven't read the book, seen the original, or actually knew anything at all about this movie before I rented it. That being said, I really enjoyed it. It was a little strange and even disturbing at times but the whole story kept me intrigued until the end. I couldn't guess who the \\"bad guy\\" was until I was shown and I thought it had some clever writing that brought the 2 stories together. The beginning credits are kinda bizarre but hey, you might like it. One last thing, I feel that alot of the reviews on Amazon.com are over-analizing the movies or albums they're reviewing. Personally I don't care if the movie \\"strayed from the book writer's original intent\\" or your $10,000 Bang & Olufsen stereo showed a \\"flat spot at 7,500 mhz\\" during a guitar solo, I just want to know if the movie's worth watching or the album's worth listening to...

B005SO6TLM|5.0|Wow I really like this record.<br /><br />Favorite tunes:<br />Lovin You - slow burner that rips once the chorus hits. Charles' voice is the real deal, and he just lets go when the emotions hit... this one crushes.<br /><br />Why Is It So Hard - Chill vibe from the Menahan St Band and Charles Bradley doing a talking blues-type thing through the verses about his trials and tribulations.<br /><br />The World - just check it out, it will give you a glimpse of what this record is all about.<br /><br />Cant wait to see this guy in concert.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This was my first experience with this sort of game. My nephew and I had a blast trying to figure out the clues. It had vey nice graphics and it was very challenging. The only thing I would change is, I wish it was longer. We had it solved after just a few hours. But for $0.99, who cares? It was worth it:-)

B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was an excellent game. The graphics were beautiful and it was very challenging. I enjoyed the Grisly Mansion one but it was too short. This was fairly lengthy with over 35 scenes. I liked the fact that it was not too easy to figure out. Definitely worth the investment and I am looking foward to the next one!
0545265355|5.0|This is a great series. I couldn't put these books down & even dreamed about them at night. Would highly recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was great to read a book that breaks away from the cookie cutter pattern of other books.

You will want the Omnibus version, because you have to know how it ends.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Just finished inside job about the financial meltdown of 2008. I am more convinced than ever than our government played and continues to play an integral role as even Obama's administration is filled with wall street bankers and lobbyists. In fact Obamas number one contributor was Goldman Sachs which became the biggest bank in America after he took office. This is not a democrat or republican issue but the very core of our government has been corrupted by banking interests which consistently is responsible for widening the gap between the rich and poor. It's important to be educated as if u are not in the 1% percent u will certainly be effected.<br /><br />2008 is just when the house of cards started to fall. But it was the process of deregulation which took many years to undue and the continuing process of corporate infiltration into America's highest levels of government that has led to this catastrophe. And on top of it all America not only bailed out these industries making them even too bigger to fail but actually made the culprits richer with bailout bonuses and tax breaks.<br /><br />Not one person has really gone to jail for their misdeeds which puts millions out of work and out of their homes leading to I'm sure among many other things addiction, prostitution, and suicide. These people are responsible and need to be held to account. Instead they raided their own companies and got government money and jobs to boot. They did not lose one penny of their gains and often dumped their stocks in a timely fashion. If America does not wake up and fast their will be no real government to speak of but only a hallow shell that houses a plutocracy inside. Obama's administration is no different with many of his top financial positions held by ex CEOs and lobbyists. This is an obvious conflict of interest.

It either locks up when I combine elements or when loading the game, with the latter being more common. The errors get worse with the more elements you discover as well; I'm at 87 now and I can't get any further. Neat game, but it's unplayable due to bugs.

B0045I3EJC|4.0|I'd give the theatrical version a 5 star rating.<br /><br />If you loved the theatrical (or you-tube) version, this one might leave you a little unsettled. The first version I saw had me seeking out the dvd immediately.<br /><br />Jared Leto gives a powerful performance; and Rhys, before his amazing performance in Anonymous, shows the promise within him. One of the extras is a tour & performance piece by Rhys.<br /><br />One of the deleted scenes is one I'd have put in! I just don't understand the need for Nemo peeing his pants so often & having it shoved in our faces. It somehow changes the tone of the film.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I've seen the Swedish version of Dragon Tattoo, but the American version is much better.  Daniel Craig is as good as usual, and Rooney Mara portrays Lisbeth Salandar exactly the way I pictured her when reading the novel.  The movie has the requisite moodiness and the final scene is perfect.  My only objection is the sometimes-annoying soundtrack by Trent Reznor, although the opening credits and music are phenomenal.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story begins with Katniss wandering around the remains of district 12 confused and upset with the sudden rebellion of the districts.  Her life has changed too quickly since her first Hunger Games, and the worst is only starting.<br /><br />Alma Coin (president of district 13) wants Katniss to be the mockingjay: the mascot of the rebellion.  Peeta, Johanna, and Annie (Finnick's girlfriend/fiance) are trapped in the Capitol being tortured for their knowledge of the uprisings.  Katniss's prep team is being treated terribly for taking extra food when the were hungry.  Nobody seems to feel for Katniss wih the small exception of Finnick.  Peeta's been hijacked to call for a cease-fire and to think that Katniss is a mutt.  There is also a love triangle between Gale, Peeta, and Katniss.  Did I mention they are having an uprising?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins uses great detail and makes you feel like you're there fighting against the Capitol.  It's awesome!<br /><br />Since you get so emotionally attatched to the characters, it's hard to put the book down and realize that it's done!<br />Just because of the description making it seem so real, I loved it and recommend it to anyone who  has read &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;Catching Fire&#34;.
0307716511|4.0|In her debut novel, \\"Sister,\\" Rosamund Lupton tweaks the police procedural with a huge infusion of emotion that makes this tale of former Londoner Beatrice coping with the unexpected loss of her sister, Tess, to either murder or suicide, one that engages the reader not only because of the mystery surrounding the young women's death, but because Beatrice's plaintive voice both disturbs and fills her audience with such strong automatic compassion.<br /><br />Technically, Lupton succeeds in crafting a believable sympathetic character whose grieving narrative rings off the page as she poignantly and intimately beseeches her dead sibling for unabashed forgiveness and leniency if Tess deems it necessary to judge her from heaven.  From Beatrice's vantage point, Tess was too bohemian, too scattered and too trusting.  As the more sensible older sister, Beatrice must pull herself together and be the rock on which her family still depends.  However, she finds that the story of Tess's demise according to the London authorities does not ring true for her and that she must investigate facets of the official report that contradict and distort her portrait of her sister.  Lupton masterfully employs a disjointed narrative where Beatrice flips back and forth--always addressing her sister whom she knows is urging her onward to discover the truth--and then a barrister who, as he takes her statement, forces her to relive the moment from a \\"now\\" perspective.  The result conjures up the distress that acts as a frantic trigger within Beatrice's mind and her struggle to keep her emotional stability from unraveling as she pieces together what actually happened while dealing with her drowning sense of loss and the disillusionment of human beings, in general, as they must cope with the seemingly unfairness of life.<br /><br />As with many British thrillers that are introduced to an American market, this one assumes the reader to be a PBS Mystery viewer, fully knowledgeable about the UK judicial system.  Perhaps a bit of an explanation with regard to the various titles and job functions would come in handy for those of us who are not as familiar with the British police procedural.  Actually, in terms of the overall novel, this lack of understanding adds to the sense of sad helplessness and frustration that is being conveyed by the main character.  Not quite getting who the people are and what their functions are in the grand scheme buttress the credibility of the distraught heroine.<br /><br />Bottom line?  The strength of Rosamund Lupton's novel \\"Sister\\" comes from its completely believable voice of its main character, Beatrice, a grieving sister who has lost her sibling to what could be murder and what the police think is suicide.  Depressed and forced to analyze her own life as she retraces the last few weeks of her sister's life, Beatrice eventually finds a peace, of sorts, that changes her view of the world.  Recommended, not as a thrilling mystery that you can't put down, but as a compelling character study.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"l system.

0525478817|2.0|with this 5th novel john green's sheep in wolf's clothing formula is set in stone. his relatable surface level irreverence and sarcasm is always followed up with some detached PSA type message that contradicts his antisocial character. his characters have that Dariaesque disaffection but they ultimately want to please their elders and respect their conservative values which is just BS. if you want to write an angsty character follow through with it in a realistic way instead of taking these patronizing sharp turns into \\"look kids, you can be a rebel and respect your elders too *thumbs up*\\" messages. if you want to have the character re-evaluate their outlook give them a realistic reason for it. he doesn't do any of that and anytime his writing seems like it's headed in an interesting original direction he derails it with a don't try this at home disclaimer. i'm consistently disappointed by john green's playing both sides of the fence and lack of balls to follow through on what he starts.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I really resisted the Twilight Saga until a student urged me to read the first book. Like so many others, I was hooked.<br /><br />Much of the allure of Twilight is the cast of the films and Breaking Dawn is no exception.  Kristen Stewart is lovely as Bella and who wouldn't want to watch Robert Pattinson?  The rest of the cast does their share too.  Billy Burke is ALWAYS great as Bella's dad.  (He has some of the best lines and he delivers them perfectly.) Bill Condon seems to really get the whole idea of this franchise, because the film is quite faithful to the plot and tone of the novel.<br /><br />There were some interesting contrasts in this film too.  The wardrobe and set dressing of the wedding were some of the most beautiful I've ever seen on film.  From the beauty of the wedding sequence the film progresses to the rather gruesome birthing. The jam and cream cheese gore combined with the crunching sound of the birth was pretty creepy. Of course, that's what the lady wrote...and the film delivers it well.

B000FC2KL0|2.0|I've never been the biggest Chili Peppers fan, although I have enjoyed their music. I figured I would give this a read since I enjoyed reading \\"Heroin Diaries\\" by Nikki Sixx so much. After reading, I like the Chili Peppers even less, and I borderline loathe Anthony Kiedis for all he is worth (which was made known to me, not very much). If you aren't sure about reading it, there is a nutshell version below but beware, it's a spoiler.<br /><br />This book is by and large the personal accounts of a cycle in a rockstars life: a perpetually drugged up Anthony falls head over heels in love with a girl. Because of his extremely expensive drug habit and reclusive nature in which he uses, he pushes his girl, his band, and his family away while he locks himself up in a seedy hotel off of Hollywood Blvd for weeks on end and banging groupies on tour. Finally, in a wonderful display of compassion, one or all of these people intervene on his life to get him into rehab. He gets clean and becomes very self rightous and spiritual with himself. He leaves rehab. Either through a bad break-up, having too much money at one time or whatever, he starts using again at full throttle, burning through thousands of dollars in days. He meets yet another girl who he falls blindly in love with either right before or right after the heroin makes a return. The tour starts, and he is back with the groupies, and back in the hotel.<br /><br />This happens oh, about 7-10 times, which makes up about 80% of the book. There is never a lesson learned by our singing frontman whatsoever. I got the impression that I was reading about a dumb, stupid animal that was overfeeding itself until it was sick, where it would just start eating again once it hacked up all that excess food. It doesn't even end on a positive note, persay. The story concludes at the most present time in his life: one of those stages in the cycle where he is momentarily sober and \\"in love\\" again, where he is very high and mighty about his life and his health, right before he nose dives back into that life at the dark hotel room with dirty needles. After I finished the book, I decided to check up on ole Anthony online and see how he was doing since then. Lo and behold, it turns out that not long after publication, he relapsed back on heroin, got dumped by his 20th love of his life/soulmate and stayed in a hotel for about a year before going to rehab. So you see? He never changed. He never learned that the people who he shames on a daily basis are the ones who keep him alive. He doesn't even thank them in his book or apologize. He's ungrateful and what's worse, he thinks it's cool.<br /><br />The only plus side to the story: you find out what the inspiration was for almost all their hit songs up to Stadium Arcadium (hint: it all happens during the cycles).<br /><br />At least Nikki Sixx finally got his life together.ife and his health, right before he nose dives back into that life at the dark hotel room with dirty needles.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Wow....I read the sample and had to purchase it once the sample ended. I can't believe how well the title describes this book..It truly is a Beautiful Disaster... Abby(Pigeon) and Travis seemed like complete opposites at first, but damn by the end they seemed perfect for one another...they were both a mess, but their characters were very believable...I wouldn't necessarily say it was a healthy relationship, but it's Fiction and I'm an adult and can fully understand that!!!<br /><br />The author did a wonderful job of keeping my attention and I wish there was a sequel...or even a short story of how they ended up ten years later...hopefully not in prison, but I wouldn't be surprised.  Excellent and entertaining read!!

B005LAIH3G|5.0|If poor reviews and poor marketing kept you from seeing this film on the big screen, then you missed a treat (and if you let film critics and the schadenfreude brigade dictate what you watch, you're an imbecile).<br /><br />John Carter, one hundred years in the making, has it all, and if it is finally discovered on Blu-Ray, it could still become the Star Wars of the current generation. The film only improves on repeated viewing, as the subtle nuances of the script and acting become more apparent.<br /><br />If nothing else, watch it for Woola. He is the most beautifully animated, most beautifully acted CGI creation I have ever witnessed. Forget Lucas' pathetic attempts to crow-bar in dire excuses for CG comic relief, the ridiculousness that was the Na'vi cat smurfs, and even (the admittedly superb) Gollum. Woola tugs at the heart strings like no-one else. It will be more than a missed opportunity if sequels are never made. It would be the loss of a dear friend in Woola.
B0073XORLU|1.0|Doesn't click for me. I can't find anything right about this project and I'm a long-time Tull fan. The music seems like a rushed lame imitation of an old classic's style rather than a genuine new creative endeavour. The lyrics I wouldn't call hard-won or much of an artistic accomplishment. They too feel rushed and surface. So what's going on here? It's title is Thick As A Brick 2! I wasn't prepared for how bad this sounds, as I liked Secret Language of Birds, but thought Dot Com was a D- in effort and outcome. TAAB2 doesn't flow or have the passion, it doesn't seem to have a clear identity like TAAB did. I don't even get a sense that Ian Anderson wrote it or is concerned with it. I don't believe it should have been called TAAB2. Even Ian Anderson in recent interviews states that the whole thing was someone else's idea and he initially hated the idea. Wow, F- for inspiration there!<br /><br />Clearly, the solo efforts of Ian Anderson and Martin Barre do very very well, both of them still getting better as solo talents. But Jethro Tull as a band effort and surprisingly, even as a band presence, this isn't, and Tull as a full force creative unit totally stopped soon after Roots To Branches (great album) and was fading before. TAAB2 doesn't radiate a sense of \\"band\\" at all; in contrast, it's coldly sheet-music sounding to me. TAAB 1 had an organic, passionate, well worked out band effort in every way and the project gained from that marvelously. Ever heard midi files played in Windows? Mechanical. Was TAAB2 recorded well before the creative process had had its time to complete?<br /><br />TAAB (the original) is a terrific listen. Fortunately, there's a freshly remixed version of it to be released probably within the next year. It's a masterpiece and a concert favourite. TAAB2 fails in process and delivery if you ask me. I suggest the Jethro Tull name be put under a headstone and the musicians be liberated to create the great quality explorations we know they can and which they seem to enjoy.
B000001E18|4.0|This is one of the very, very few albums I hated when I first heard it and subsequently grew to appreciate. Songs like Babyface were so bad at the start, and let's be honest always were bad. Just a terrible, awful song. However, there are some truly great tracks in here--and I'm not including Numb, another banal--at best--track, even if catchy the first few times.<br /><br />This album was a catastrophic fall from grace after Achtung Baby. Still, on its own it earned 4 stars because of a few very nice tracks: starting with Lemon and most of the rest of the album is worth listening to.<br /><br />The main thing I remember about this album unfortunately is that it proved to me that U2 is capable of folly, for this preceded the most horrendous of craptastic albums known as Pop, a true piece of turd, though almost fully vindicated by All That You can't leave Behind.

1444737090|5.0|Praise to James Bowen and Bob!  I think Mr. Bowen and his editor did a fabulous job with the narrative of this book and in conveying the journey he and Bob have made together from drug addiction and living rough on the streets to a more stable and responsible existence.  This book is a fine example of the healing powers of animals in giving someone without much hope something to live and strive for; to be a better person.  As the quote goes, \\"My goal in life is to be as good a person as my dog (in this case, cat) already thinks I am\\", so does Mr. Bowen try to become that person and succeeds very nicely.  The prose is very down to earth and straight-forward and Mr. Bowen does not allow himself to be a victim and takes full responsibility for the actions which landed him on the streets.  I love the theme of second chances in this book and that you've got to be able to recognize and act upon them.  And obviously Bob is one uncommon cat as I've found ginger tabbies so often are, and very attached to his person, James.  I hope this book changes both their lives for the better and may they have nothing but health and prosperity from this point forward.

Great job!<br /><br />Update 11/29/2012:<br />I had several updates since I purchased this APP but it not always works after the update.  Twice it just would freeze up on my G-Tab (ViewSonic w.

There should be more extensive testing before those updates are pushed out.

B004LZF2LW|5.0|PolyClock does a super job of illustrating the real-world geometry that creates time zones, as well as managing and displaying zones of interest. On the list of chosen time zones, it cleverly shows the true progression through the solar day for that location using a blue bar, so that you can see, for example, that Los Angeles and Seattle have different times of dusk and dawn even though they share a time zone. Interface is beautiful and intuitive to use. Recommended.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a page turner!!! I couldn't put it down. Make sure you have several hours free when you start this book because you wont be able to put it down.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|To indicate how old and out of touch I must be, I bought The Hunger Games for the Kindle because it was recommended by Amazon.  I hadn't heard a thing about it.  Really.  When I saw the number of reviews I realized it must be a big deal.  I liked the book quite a bit; fast paced, unique plot, engaging characters, and a good ending for the first in a series. You certainly don't have to keep reading the next ones...although I did.  I'll spare you the plot summary and my analysis of the socioeconomic sub-text, as there are waaay too many of those already.<br /><br />I let my 11 year old read it too; it's a little brutal but no real bad words or sex or anything, so I figured it was okay, and he liked it a lot.  The universe of books that both an 11 year old and a 40-something can enjoy isn't that big, so bonus on that score.<br /><br />Now to calm down the over-hyped:  The Hunger Games is NOT the greatest book of all time.  It's not a life changing experience to read it, nor will it sit on your shelf as an all-time classic in 30 years.  If you really found yourself a changed person from reading this book, I'd suggest you pick up Don Quixote, the Count of Monte Cristo, Gulliver's travels, or even To Kill a Mockingbird....as you really need to get out more.<br /><br />And finally, I read the next two books too, and while both decent, neither is as good as this one.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book is a huge disappointment!!!! Let me start out by saying I loved the first two books. I couldn't put either one of them down. Sadly I can not say the same about this book. I felt like the author just gave up. It was completely disorganized and had no ending she summed up the ending in 5 pages which for a 3 part series is completely unacceptable.  I finished the book and felt frustrated and disappointed with the authors job on this book.

0060853972|5.0|Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch is a contemporary and comedic fantasy written by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett in 1990. The collaboration between two of the finest fantasy authors of our generation is nothing short of brilliant, and while they both shared everything equally and did it for fun, Pratchett has said they wouldn't do it again for a big clock.<br /><br />The antichrist has been born, the four bikers of apocalypse have gathered, its the end of the world as we know it and its all happening in the small english suburb of Lower Tadfield. This is not the news the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley had been hoping for as they have become quite accustomed to their lives on earth and are starting to have second thoughts about the whole Armageddon thing. Despite being mortal enemies they decide to work together to help raise the antichrist in the hope that when it comes time for the apocalypse, the antichrist might just decide not to carry through with it. If only those meddling satanic nuns hadn't got to him first...<br /><br />Good Omens is by far one of the funniest works of fiction I have ever read. Pratchett and Gaiman have managed to create a story that weaves together large doses of satire, cynicism, slapstick and wacky unconventional humour into a cohesive yet suprisingly accurate observation of human life all over the world. The characters, one of the biggest strengths in this book, bring a lot charm and humour to the book by managing to be both unique yet stereotypically British at the same time.<br /><br />The side plots are are another strength of this story that despite being seemingly random and independent stories are actually laying a solid foundation for the main plot by providing lot of relevant background information and support. This is a fun story that uses these side plots to make light of what can be some very serious and topical themes. While the side plots themselves are a strength, the haphazard way in which they are a told is a slight weakness as they can sometimes be confusing and hard to follow, especially if you haven't picked up the book for a few days. Also there are a few side plots and characters in there that do not really add a great deal to the story and feel like they are just there to grab a few cheap laughs. In the bigger scheme of things these are very minor gripes and do little to detract from what is well thought out, well paced and enjoyable story.<br /><br />The description above barely scratches the surface of what is a very broad yet complex array of characters and plots because I needed a limit to prevent my nice and accurate review from becoming an overwhelming and unwieldly beast. There is so much going on, so many little details to keep track of, and yet it still manages to come together quite nicely to form a great story about what it means to be human.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|A Discovery of Witches was a disappointment. Entire chapters could - and should - have been omitted. The protag rides a horse. She goes to yoga. She goes rowing. She talks to her long distance aunt for purely expository purposes. It's asking a lot for a reader to go along with; grappling for a reason for all this while grappling for some reason to even like Diana.<br />The other troublesome thing with Harkness' book is that narration should advance plot, not indulge an author's vast knowledge on this or that arcane subject, although these elements could have been interwoven successfully. They just weren't. They're baldly, well, self-indulgent.  Readng it I felt I was auditing a course I was glad I didn't pay for. Except I did.<br />Attempting to ride the wave of vampire literature straight into the beach is fine. But if one is going to be derivative of Twilight and write 'for grown-ups' one should at least look to Bella to see why she is so loved by readers. Or turn to the Bible of the genre, Interview With a Vampire, to discover just why Louis, Claudia, and even Lestat find their way into the reader's heart. With her chops Harkness could have done better. Let's hope in future she does. I've 'removed it from my device'.  And I'll skip the movie.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is a wonderful and stunning album.  I first heard it streaming on NPR, then I listened to it 5 more times.  Today the album came out and I bought it.  The closest link I can make musically is to earlier Arcade Fire, but with the melodic forcefulness of The Tallest Man on Earth.  If you are into any of these bands, check out this album.  It was a fantastic surprise.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I've tried other alarm clock apps for Android, and they've all fallen short in some way or another. Alarm Clock Xtreme is the best alarm clock app I've tried for the Android platform so far; it superior to the stock android alarm app.
B0073XORCY|5.0|In this day and age of singles it's refreshing to have a CD that was intended to be heard front to back with a common concept.  Ian Anderson the consummate pro does not disappoint. Very few artist can actually do this effectively. That last concept albums that moved me were The Decemberists [[ASIN:B000HKDEEW The Crane Wife]] and Queensrÿche [[ASIN:B000E1ZBHM Operation: Mindcrime II]] So this has been long overdue!<br /><br />The intro pulls you in with familiar Thick As Brick chords and continues the life story of our friend Gerald with the song \\"From a pebble Thrown\\" This is a great song and fits seamlessly with the 1st thick as a brick. Ian's band is superb! The thing that threw me off at first was the spoken segue passages throughout the CD. They seemed to interrupt the flow of the music. Now that i have listened to this several times I can appreciate it more. I guess I was too excited to hear the music that the spoken words originally seemed in the way. After I listened to \\"Banker, Bets, Banker Wins\\" and \\"Old School Song\\" several times to satisfy my musical hunger I was able to sit back and listen to the story. This is a fine wrap up of Gerald's life journey.<br /><br />So, I converted this album to MP3 2 different ways. I joined all the tracks and ripped one version as an entire 59 minute song then combined several of the tracks together to use as singles in playlists. I combined Tracks 3-5 (Might-Have-Beens, Upper Sixth Loan Shark and Banker Bets, Banker Wins) Tracks 10-13 (Power And Spirit, Give Till It Hurts, Cosy Corner and Shunt And Shuffle) and Tracks 15-16 (Confessional and Kismet In Suburbia) and left the other songs as is and they work great in playlists.<br /><br />I have tickets to see him and his band play the seminal masterpiece Thick as Brick in it's entirety In November and can't wait. Go get tickets now. This may be your only chance to see this in it's entirety!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! I have never read this type of book before and I was throughly entertained. I couldn't nor did I want to put it down. I highly recommend this to any one willing to read it. It parallels with Twilight, minus the supernatural, any (adult)fan of Twilight will really like this book. Just started book number 3 in the series and I might just have to re-read them all once done. I cannot say enough how enjoyable this book has been to read!!! A huge THANK YOU to the author for this amazing book!!!
1597801585|3.0|I like a good science fiction cautionary tale, and in an era where there are so many things that we still do not understand, there is plenty of material out there for sci-fi writers to create something chilling that plays on our biggest fears. Global warming, genetic engineering, western consumerism - all of our greatest fears associated with these issues are drawn out and explored by Paolo Bacigalupi in his Hugo, Nebula and Locus winning novel The Windup Girl.<br /><br />Bacigalupi paints a bleak picture of the future, a world overrun by bio-terrorism as calorie companies engineer crippling viruses that destroy crops and force nations to buy their own virus resistant crops. Global warming due to carbon emissions has seen the development of kink spring technology, devices that store energy (calories) by being wound up. Animals and now humans are being genetically engineered, questioning spiritual beliefs about the soul and how it reincarnates. Thailand has shut itself from the world almost completely, burning anything and everything that the foreign menace try to sneak past the border. It is a world that has been crafted so well that it feels like it might be a very plausible future. This world building is where The Windup Girl really shines, creating a cautionary tale that really engages with the reader in the hope that it may inspire action to stop this future from becoming a reality.<br /><br />Bacigalupi explores this world through the eyes of five main protagonists, each with their own separate stories that slowly but surely interweave with each other as the book accelerates towards a \\"big bang\\" ending. These stories are cleverly constructed, they do a lot to make this book into a coherent novel whilst further fleshing out the cautionary tale, and they work hard at making the reader think. But there is a big problem here, the stories are just so depressing. For example - Emiko the windup girl is contraband, surviving as a taboo prostitute with her earnings usedto fund the bribes that make the authorities look the other way. Things don't ever get better for her throughout the story, as she suffers more and more degrading abuse in the hope of one day being free. The other stories are similarly depressing with Bacigalupi not afraid to hold back, putting the characters in desperate situations with brutal consequences. It was really hard for me to maintain my motivation to read this novel - there was rarely any joy, rarely any fun to be had, and to be honest I just don't like to read depressing books.<br /><br />The characters themselves, I really liked. In a world that is so hard on all of them, they show amazing resilience to keep on fighting in the hope that everything will turn out ok. They are all clearly motivated by their own reasons, they all display varying levels of intelligence, but what really separates them is their morality and the way in which each of them reacts when presented with similar scenarios. While one character will do whatever they can to save a village from an outbreak, another will have no qualms at all about setting fire to the village \\"for the greater good\\" - it creates a great contrast between seemingly similar characters.  The resilience is by no means overdone, and as Bacigalupi presses them hard and harder, one by one their resilience gives out and they break. I like seeing characters being put through the meat grinder and coming out the other side having been fundamentally scarred by the experience, but I think Bacigalupi presses to hard here on too many characters, and in the end the broken characters are left with so little of their former selves that the little victories a few of the characters have towards the end don't really feel like victories at all. Again, just too depressing for my tastes.<br /><br />Technically, The Windup Girl is written very well. The narration style is more third person omniscience which was weird for me at first having read so much third person limited and first person narration, but I got used to it quick enough and I think it really suits the mood of the story. The pacing is a bit slow, but that may be coloured by my lack of motivation to keep reading the story. One thing that I really liked was Bacigalupi's use of native languages. While the narration was done primarily in English, there was no attempt made to translate some of the more emotive dialogue and for me that was a good thing because the infrequent use of native languages really worked to punctuate some of the big issues and themes that Bacigalupi wanted to highlight.<br /><br />This book is not for me. It was far too depressing, it was hard work, and I don't think I will be revisiting it again. I really appreciate what Bacigalupi has done with this story, and there  are so many things he does right with each and every element of the book, but in the end I like to read as a form of entertainment and escapism, and I was not able to get that with this book. That said it might just be me feels this way, so for a book that does so many things right there is a good chance that you will love this book
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the trilogy for my kindle, bought due to the price differences in books these days, after watching the first movie with my wife.  I was leery about getting these books, but was pleasantly surprised.  I read all three books in one weekend.  My wife has just started the first book.<br /><br />The bad:<br />1. The technology in the books doesn't make logical sense to me.  The capitol can create these giant arena's and control everything down to the weather inside them and create mutations and elaborate traps but not have anything better than a hovercraft for the air force? They have the technology to make laser weapons, but never use them in the books and are only mentioned once.  They are always using bullets.<br />2. The timeline that events happen seems off in some areas.  Things progress exceedingly fast for something that is occurring in a country the size of North America.<br /><br />Both good and bad:<br />1. The ending of the book, after all the action is wound up, is rather long; however it is justified due to the level of physical and mental abuse the characters face.<br />2. I would have liked more information of the founding of Panem and the president.  It gives just enough to let the reader know where it is and the basics of why it formed but doesn't go into any details.<br /><br />The good:<br />1. It presents a lot of action without going into too much detail, so it never seems gory but you can easily picture what is happening.<br />2. The characters are believable and likeable.<br />3. It has several surprises throughout the series that keeps the storyline interesting and introduces new things to the world throughout the whole series.<br />4. It is easy to read.  The language used flows well.<br /><br />I gave the Hunger Games a five due to the way it left me.  When I was younger I read all the time, but for the past 10 years or so, can count the number of new books I have read on one hand or two hands.  I have been scouring Amazon looking formore books to read again and have picked out about 10 new ones.  This series helped me return to reading for enjoyment.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|This dark story is lifted into excellence by the wonderful script and the excellent acting by all concerned. Even the set decoration is wonderful. Sean Penn should have received an Academy Award as he deserved it even more than Susan Sarandan. It's the finest acting I've ever seen him do. And, what a joy to see an actress do a part like this with no makeup at all.  This is possibly the best directing of a film I've ever witnessed. To do so much with so few sets and so few main actors. Tim Robbins did a masterful job. To anyone who is put off by the story please just watch it for the masterpiece it is.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|-----warning, this review may spoil books including 1984, three musketeers, princess bride and MockingJay if you have not read them----<br /><br />I'm not English major or anything, but I've done my share of reading. When Borders was closing down it's stores, I happen to go and pick up a few books for myself that included Hunger Games, Princess Bride, and 1984. I read 1984 first, and loved it. George Orwell is a master author when it comes to manipulating a reader's feelings, He will make you feel depressed like his characters, and then excited well his characters are rebelling, and then he absolutely crushes your admiration for the characters you learned to love, thus making you furious at the circumstances that the character was under. When I finished 1984 I wanted to chuck the book across the room because my emotions were that strong. I hated the ending of 1984 so much, that I loved it, because you were supposed to hate the ending.<br /><br />When I picked up Hunger Games, the first thing i noticed was that it was written in first person. well, okay, fine, it's a YA novel, what did I expect? but because it was written in present tense, first person, you could tell that Katniss was never going to die. and because of that, any scenes that involved her being in death's path bored me. sure, she might get hurt, but she's the hero of the book, causing her any harm that would cripple or kill her would be like doing the same to Superman. It just doesn't happen, or when it does, some how they pull through.<br /><br />next thing was, you could tell, that by the way she was setting up certain characters, that they were not going to die. if you're not sure what I mean, then think about this; the Characters we really get to know at all are Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and Haymitch. all others are kept at a distance, including Katniss's little sister. the characters that live at the end are Katniss, Peeta, Gale and Haymitch. the Characters that we really spend anytime with in the first book are Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch, the only three people that return to district 12 from the first book are Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch.<br /><br />okay, fine, maybe it doesn't seem fair to compare The Hunger Games trilogy to 1984 seeing as one is a melodrama(serious but ends happy) and the other is a tragedy(serious throughout with a not so happy ending). But what about other books i read in the same year, like Princess Bride(tragic comedy) and Three Musketeers(romance/adventure)? Princess Bride ends with the four main characters being chased by the king looking to kill them all, and it looks as though our hero's are about to die. I loved that book as well, very well written, and again, the author knows how to manipulate his reader as well as orwell.<br /><br />In Three Musketeers, D'artagnan is madly in love with Constance, who later is killed by Mylady. you as the reader don't want to see Constance die, you want to see D'artagnan and the Three Musketeers succeed in saving her. Just like how you want to see katniss succeed in saving peeta or gale...but peeta and gale don't ever die...personally i kind of wanted to see some sort of battle between peeta and gale, peeta being brainwashed would have let it such that gale was forced to kill him to protect katniss...or maybe have it such that katniss had to kill peeta in order to protect gale...or maybe have gale die out of his own anger...but to just randomly kill of characters that I have no emotional connection to in the first place really just kind of bores me as a reader. why should i care that any of those characters were put in danger, if i never really got to know them in the first place?<br /><br />if you want to read a good book about socialism, read 1984. not this.<br /><br />if you want to read a book for entertainment, read princess bride. not this<br /><br />if you want to read a classic, read three musketeers, but whatever you do, don't read this.<br /><br />if you want to read something fun with characters you will actually want to connect with, read Harry Potter. but not this book.
B007HNFREW|5.0|From what I hear, this series is very close to the source material... so one could gather that the books must contain rape, incest, adultery, brothels..... come on, it's on HBO. What did you expect? Why else would they even make it? These horrible things that happen to these characters only make them more real, which I must say is an astonishing feat for a FANTASY series. Even Deadwood, HBOs wild west series, featured all of these things and more. HBO is racy, it's sort of their thing when it comes to adult prime time series. I also must say that I'm not a huge fantasy fan, and my boyfriend and I entered into viewing this series with reservations, which quickly fell to the wayside. This show is like pure guilty pleasure soapy delight set against a gorgeous sweeping backdrop of a fantasy world we've never seen before: A more harsh, brutal, and realistic fantasy world than ever created on screen. Think Dynasty in the Olde World; with dragons.
B00729V7NG|5.0|Max Cavalera has been taking Soulfly in a heavier direction for several albums now, but the last one, Omen, slowed things down somewhat. Now, Enslaved is here to kick everything back into massive overdrive. This CD will cave in a few skulls when unsuspecting listeners pop it in and wait for Max to \\"go through the motions\\" with some standard groove metal.  In my opinion, these songs resemble Sepultura's sound more than any other Soulfly release, but it's not a straight Sep sound; you can hear the unmistakable stamp of both bands in almost every song. Cavalera and company thrash it out from one track to the next, refusing to let up for a moment. Even the slower sections crush, like on Legions and American Steel, where the groove is more about head-stomping than jumping around. Combined with their past discography, this album solidifies Soulfly's legacy as a top-tier metal band. Incredible.<br /><br />By the third and fourth Soulfly albums, the band seemed to have grown comfortable with a familiar formula, giving the impression in their music of repetition and simplicity, which also carried over into the song arrangements. Lyrics kept getting more and more simplistic, songs got shorter, and a certain lack of fire spawned many Soulfly critics who suggested Max was losing some of his creativity. Enslaved puts those notions to rest. Each song is fleshed out; they all feel complete in a way they didn't on Omen, and to some extent, Conquer. Riffs have more drive, new drummer Dave Kinkade absolutely rips it up on drums, and new bassist Tony Campos lays a crushing bottom-heavy foundation. Much of the melody brought by Marc Rizzo on the last few albums has been replaced with pure speed and aggression, though his skills still shine with some choice classical and flamenco interludes. Make no mistake, Max was out to make a statement with Enslaved, and he's succeeded. I'm happy to say this is a full-fledged five-star album for Max Cavalera and Soulfly! For anyone interested, here's a closer look at a few highlights.<br /><br />Resistance--Short intro track with some Chaos A.D. power-drill guitars and shouted-word vocals.<br /><br />World Scum--Death metal destruction with Cattle Decapitation vocalist.<br /><br />Intervention--Relentless thrash assault with old-school sound.<br /><br />American Steel--Meaty riffing, powerful drumming, and a HEAVY breakdown.<br /><br />Redemption of Man by God and Treachery--Ultra-heavy speed-groove, with nice vocals by Dez from Devildriver on Redemption.<br /><br />Plata O Plomo--Old Soulfly tradition of Portuguese lyrics with a stomping beat and great riffs.<br /><br />Chains--Epic track, over seven minutes, that runs the gamut of Soulfly's metal repertoire with thrash, groove, and even a blast beat.<br /><br />Revengeance--Max and his sons finish the album with an almost Nailbomb sense of industrial heaviness.<br /><br />Great bonus tracks on the special edition include the thrasher Slave, which ends with some classic lines from Tribe off the first Soulfly album. Next, Bastard might be the most standard track of the whole collection, sounding like a basic groove-based Soulfly song that could be on just about any release. Finally, the eighth installment of the Soulfly instrumentals is the first to incorporate a violin, throwing an entirely new twist on the spiritual, tribal element for which these tracks have come to be known, and strengthening the overall sense that each musician involved put everything they had into the making of Enslaved.s a closer look at a few highlights.<br /><br />Resistance--Short intro track with some Chaos A.D. power-drill guitars and shouted-word vocals.<br /><br />World Scum--Death metal destruction with Cattle Decapitation vocalist.<br /><br />Intervention--Relentless thrash assault with old-school sound.<br /><br />American Steel--Meaty riffing, powerful drumming, and a HEAVY breakdown.<br /><br />Redemption of Man by God and Treachery--Ultra-heavy speed-groove, with nice vocals by Dez from Devildriver on Redemption.<br /><br />Plata O Plomo--Old Soulfly tradition of Portuguese lyrics with a stomping beat and great riffs.<br /><br />Chains--Epic track, over seven minutes, that runs the gamut of Soulfly's metal repertoire with thrash, groove, and even a blast beat.<br /><br />Revengeance--Max and his sons finish the album with an almost Nailbomb sense of industrial heaviness.<br /><br />Great bonus tracks on the special edition include the thrasher Slave, which ends with some classic lines from Tribe off the first Soulfly album.

B004X80QNG|5.0|Syncs with Google works splendidly on my AT&amp;T Motorola Atrix you people with the Kindle Fire shoulda read about it before buying it it only works with apps from a limited market if you want a tablet buy one not some jacked up glossy screen e-reader
B0002XNT0I|5.0|From the opening music to the final credits, this is a masterpiece of film making. Perfect casting. Beautifully filmed. Wonderfully directed. I've watched it several times just to enjoy the perfect film which one so seldom sees. Once in a while a film maker \\"gets it right\\". This is one of those times.
0312427646|4.0|Hardly a wrong note in the book, \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" imagines, extremely well, what would happen if the Queen of England were a reader.  Not just a casual reader, but if she suddenly became a voracious reader playing catchup with the classics and how that might begin to effect her decisions as the monarch.  At times the relationship between the Queen and the boy she initially meets in the mobile library is a bit precious, but nonetheless there is something delightful in the path the Queen traverses in her reading and her growing disdain for non-readers.  There is really no excuse for skipping this slim volume as it can obviously be consumed in one (very short) sitting - I think you'll be happy you did!
0345803485|2.0|Two things. First, my inner goddess and I have never been more excited about a trilogy. But I guess that's easy if you're writing sex sex sex every two sentences<br />Unfortunately, the writing is a bit sterile Mrs. James.<br />Your characters, especially Anastasia is so repetitive that it becomes impossible to read..she sounds like a thirty something one minute; witty sexy and empowered and like a stupid immature teenager the next...(yawn)<br />And Christian, \\"oh my, jeez \\" Christian... he is completely off, I mean if he really is a dominant;  abused, messed up  and troubled, then why is he soooo soft and...mundane around her, because he finally found  \\"love\\"?, come on Mrs. James, we can do better than that, can't we?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't convinced that I was going to fall in love with this book. Mostly, because the sex scenes were a bit much for me. However, I found myself caring about the characters and the story line much more than I expected. I just glazed over some of the sex when it got too redundant. I went on to read the second and third books in the trilogy, and I am so glad I did. Each one is better than the last.
B004LZF2LW|1.0|unable to really explore this apps as it crashed and forced close on my kindle fire every time I tried to use it. I finally decided to uninstall it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|so far this app does exactly what I want out of a weather app. It may be a bit slow to load but everything else is perfect.
B005THRU0C|5.0|Love the cd, amazon however sent it to me in an already opened scratched cd case simply slipped inside a plastic sleeve. This means its obviously used but i was charged full price. Bullshit move, so be aware. Might wanna just buy this from the store instead
0451169514|5.0|Most folks wanna right these long drawn out reviews of their favorite books of all time. All I wanna say is, \\"This is one of The Most Shite kicking story's of all time\\". Love ya Mr. King...You are Super Awesome. D
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books! I am so sad that I have finished them. Without going in to detail, the story left me feeling that everything was wrapped up with a bow. I just wish this series could keep going!
